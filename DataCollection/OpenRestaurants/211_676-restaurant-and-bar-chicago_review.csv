2017-09-02,5.0,"Stopped in for a charcuterie platter and drinks, stayed for the best lamb of our life! So many good cheese and meat options, we didn't know what to chose. Alexandra, recommended her favorites and they all paired so well and did not have a disappointment out of the bunch. Having filled up on meats and cheeses, we decided to split just one entree. Again, we could not make a decision with all the great sounding options. Since Alexandra hit a home run on the apps, we asked her her opinion and she recommended the lamb. Hands down best lamb I've ever hand. Flavortown, USA, dynamite, out of bounds, (insert any guy fieri saying here). It was truly wonderful. In addition to the great food and drinks the manager, Jill, checked in on us frequently to make sure we were happy. It was super busy and we saw she gave the same service to all dining around us. It was great. Food: 10/10 service: 10/10 atmosphere: 10/10. Would go back any day if the week and twice on sundays!",0.9951,0.722,0.269,0.009,0.5455246913580247

2017-02-15,4.0,"I came here for Sunday New Years day brunch and luckily they had tables available. The only thing that's a bummer is that I had requested a window seat when I made a reservation and asked the girl in the morning when they just opened and she kind of gave me the ""It's first come first serve"" answer which isn't quite the case since they clearly allow and take reservations. But aside from that, this restaurant offers a wonderful view. We all got the buffet brunch since that way we could try everything. Kids under two eat for free which was nice to feed by toddlers as they liked the croissants and the omelette station here. They offer tons of cheeses, meats, pastries, bacon, sausage, the works. I especially liked their organic parfait with fruits and granola, I seriously wanted to take some home since it was healthy and delicious.  Only wish is that they added lox to their brunch menu because nothing says more than brunch than bagels and lox. I definitely would come again if I'm in the area and I don't want to splurge on the peninsula brunch, this one is a little more affordable in a very nice environment with a nice staff.",0.9874,0.792,0.183,0.025,0.6835227272727273

They have nice choices for folks who are gluten intolerant despite a limited menu.  They also have gluten-free bread and butter.   Overall, it was a good evening.  It was surprisingly quiet here, with only one other couple eating in the restaurants aside from the private event in the room next door.  Server was quirky, and a little impatient with my inquisitive company, who wanted lots of reassurance that gluten-free items were safe to eat.  We had the miller chicken, and it was moist and well-seasoned.  It came with roasted golden carrots and potatoes, and these were tender and buttery.  The serving dishes were quite beautiful but impractical to eat from, and the waiter seemed slightly miffed when we inquired if the hot cast iron personal deep dishes could be set to the side of the plates and serving spoons brought to table so the food could be scooped onto a plate.  Eventually the server warmed up to us, and even brought over a free birthday creme brulee, which had a good flavor and nice presentation.   We also had beet, arugula, and goat cheese fritter salad which was sublime--nice flavors, texture, color, all in all splendid.  The iceberg salad with bacon and soft boiled egg wasn't great...the egg was cold and overcooked and the dressing too bitter for my tastes.  Lastly we had a meatball appetizer.  These richly flavored meatballs were moist, but the sauce seemed to have been cooked down too much, and was overly salty..   Oh, and the breadsticks!  I love the little french breadsticks.  An assistant to the waiter came by with these (they are not gluten-free) and offered extra.  They were very very good.  I'd like to try this place for breakfast. . .and I hope they have the french breadsticks then as well!",0.9944,0.818,0.167,0.015,0.5250922350922352

Excellent service - made us feel pampered. Sadly, however, the food was not up to par. We were there for lunch during Chicago Restaurant Week.  My shrimp flatbread sounded delicious on the menu, but the execution was lacking. Tasteless crustaceans served on a messy layer of stuff-on-cream-cheese that was mainly colorless and not very pretty to look at. Companion's turkey bacon panini was hardly recognizable as turkey. Seemed a ground-up hodgepodge of stuff on thin, not very flavorful panini bread. French fries that came with it were cooked too dark on the outside and yet were not very crispy. There were even a couple of pieces that were undercooked. Another companion had the steakburger and liked it very much, with spears of fresh fruit as a side. We liked the fact we could order either a 6 or a 9-ounce glass of wine. The sauvignon blanc was very nice and not outrageouslyy priced at $14 for the larger portion. Service was mainly very good. Attentive, professional, accommodating. The only small false note was when I asked for fries as the side with my flatbread, the server  didn't tell me at that time that the item doesn't come with any sides. Thus, I was unhappily surprised to find it served without.  It's a shame the food (2 stars) didn't match the rest (4 stars)  Still, I'd come back for drinks just to enjoy the beautiful surroundings.

I am so glad we did, because this was hands down the best food we had in Chicago, maybe ever. When we checked in at the Omni we told them it was our honeymoon, and we were sent a complimentary delicious piece of chocolate cake and a bottle of champagne.  When we came in we had a beer and cheese sampler. We were a bit annoyed as we had to ask for attention from a server, but after that everything was fine and the food and beer was fantastic. Nice ambiance, comfy nested good cuddling spots, and a nice view.  We came in for the breakfast buffet as well. Again, wonderful food, and better service than the first time.  The real show stopper was dinner. My husband had a New York strip steak and I had a pork chop. I don't profess to be a master chef or anything, but it isn't often that we go to a restaurant and get something that I couldn't make better myself. Well, I have no idea what sort of voodoo magic they pulled on the food. Both of our meals were over-the-top ridiculously tender and fantastic.  Funny enough, after hearing so much about Gibsons world famous steak, we went there the next day for lunch. We were so disappointed, and that was with a filet mignon that yes, I could cook better myself. 676 is way better, and while it's not inexpensive, it is far more reasonable than Gibsons, which seems more of a place to look important than anything.  My only criticism is the menu is somewhat limited, however with the room service menu being much bigger, I suspect that they could probably make whatever you have in mind. The overall theme is very trendy, with locally sourced food, mason jar glasses, and food served on wooden cutting boards, but the food holds its own without the gimmicks.

2013-12-29,3.0,"So... I have made a point to come to this establishment over the last 7 years even though I have oodles of choices available to me- I digress... I am a "" foodie"" a "" gastronomic aficionado""... A "" conneiseur of great cuisine""... By that I mean the ""best slice "" the most amazing "" Chidog!"" ( love ya Portillos) In other words- I seek and I source by choice the "" creme da la creme"" in the most pure form- get my drift? In any case, I made a last minute decision to come to one of my most favorite Chicago eateries (even though I felt they sold out by replacing their unique and edgy decor for a more "" neutral and boringly aesthetically pleasing "" color scheme to appeal to the masses.) I did this on Christmas Day-today-December 25th, 2013. A day like no other for me. You see? I have 6 children- all now adults- but we love each other's company- but because of new marriages, new homes and practicality- we decided for me not to come home until New Years because we were not lacking in the "" togetherness"" category since we have amazing times together regardless of a "" holiday date"". So we facetimed as I sat in this beautiful place I have learned to love so much- the 676. (I was a registered guest of its' hotel after all.) I had not decided to eat here- just checked in and it happened to "" show up"" as a possibility. So I did. Commented on the abbreviated bar menu that I knew to be so extensive- was told there was a "" prefix""available exclusively for the holiday meal. Thought about it... checked it out... appealed to my culinary instincts and went for it! First course... Amazing!!! Charcuterie to beat the band- duck prosciutto,cold smoked salmon, lamb prosciutto,and pepperoni. All accompanied by an incredibly matched "" ecoutrement"".., doneski!! Second course... Went with the margherita flatbread-always a favorite of many- did not disappoint... Third course... Their eclectic  choice  of their various soups and salads. I honed in on one of my favorites here- baked potato soup- and by that I mean I have ordered it - and then ordered it again in the same sitting I was so impressed! I received it in the same manner that I was accustomed to by the server bringing it to me presented with its' "" bits"" in the bowl with a miniature pitcher of the liquid to be poured over it. Cool... Wait- not!  Had  to apologetically send it back because it resembled nothing in either taste nor texture of what I remembered- chalked it up to an abundant batch meant to feed the masses of the ""prefix menu"" askers and let if go. 4th course... Entree-a myriad of choices from lamb chops to walleye and chicken and steaks- the normal players in a sexy way of being presented all the while maintaining their"" local  and sustainable"" commitment to area farmers... I elected to have the ""dry  aged creekstone farm ribeye"" ( with a $25 imposed supplement to the already ""$65 prefix cost""  That was fine- never an issue for a great meal- especially one that was to take the place of my not being at home with my family for the first time in 25 years) So here is my "" beef"".., sorry for the digression... I ordered it medium rare- I got it medium. Was not going to say anything but decided to bring it to the attention to the server- she had the manager come to talk to me. I decide to google am image of medium rare to state my case because I have never written a review of dissatisfaction in my life, but I do believe in notifying people who pride their establishment as above par. I did so- she agreed if was not cooked to standards and walked away. Thinking she was bringing me what I ordered initially, j sipped my wine awaiting the promised ribeye with my chosen temperature... Nothing... ANC then she-the manager- appeared and stated she would deduct 50% from my bill for the mistake again reiterating it was not cooked to order. I accepted her gesture while saying I did not require a discount- just wanted to finish my meal with the entree requested. Apparently we had a misunderstanding or a miscommunication because when I inquired from the server what was to happen she stated that the manager was taking 50% off my steak- for the mistake... But the steak that I did not ask for I was receiving a discount even though I could not eat it? ( and those of you who know how you like your steaks done- Medium is not a "" happy medium"" to put in your mouth. So here I am paying for a $150 plus meal that I was not offered the alternative to enjoy- just a "" half-off"" special of a steak I have no desire to chew its' toughened center!... Oh well- at least I have a Baileys and coffee w/ their espresso creme brûlée to enjoy- just wanted my damn steak 'cause after all it's Christmas! Sorry foodies- did not want to go all "" bah humbug"" on you- but I feel bewildered at the situation. I know a saying that goes "" it is not how bad you f@ck up- but how well you recover"".

The presentation of the food was great as it had a very rustic feel to it.  Brown paper wrapped whole breads, that you sliced yourself, were placed on huge wood cutting boards.  The selection of spreads, jams, honeys, butters and sauces was awesome.....everything from their own version of nutella and wild blueberry cream cheese to almond butter and fruit jams.  I took one thick slice of bread and put on as many spreads as I could so that each bite would deliver a new flavor.  A little party for the taste buds. The station that followed featured bacon, sausages both link and patty (blueberry maple anyone?), potatoes and lovely miniature bread puddings.  I couldn't resist the latter especially when I drizzled the apple caramel compote that came on the side.  The buffet also had croissants, bagels, fruit, cereal, granola, smoothies, salsas, etc. Since I was watching my cholesterol, I decided to order an egg substitute omelet from the grill section.  I ordered all the veggies plus a pinch of cheese.  I've had egg whites before but never the stuff that actually looks like the real deal.  The omelet was the best I have ever had.  I am not sure what was in it exactly but it just burst with flavor.  The mushrooms had been sauteed so they were super woodsy and tender.  Everything just came together in perfect symphony wrapped in a delicious package.  I truly wasn't expecting anything special and I walked away wowed by my experience.",0.9934,0.813,0.16,0.027,0.5387920016491446

Each also had its own spread, sauce or chutney that were in these tiny jars (I guess they had elves make them?) and served on a pita or cracker. The fun part was mixing and matching the food with a different spread. Oh, the flavors. I ordered the whitefish for a main course, served on a bed of apple slices. I didn't get what the sauce was that went with it but I loved the entire dish. The side caesar salad was good too.

2012-02-25,5.0,"My friends and I went here to experience Chicago Restaurant Week.  Now, Restaurant Week can be hit or miss with the menus being smaller or less than good version of the full price menu.  I am pleased to say that was not the case here at 676 Restaurant and Bar.  Now, we came in expecting to pay $33 for 3 courses, but we got four.  They changed it so now you get 4 courses for $33 and 4 courses (with premium entree) for $44.  The Meat and Cheese appetizer was really good.  Each cheese or meat was paired with a sauce, chutney, spread that came in cute little jars.  They were all delicious with my favorites being the goat cheese and the lamb bacon.  Then came the bread basket and the soup or salad course.  I chose the potato soup and it was an entertaining presentation.  The waiter poured the soup over the potatoes right in front of me.  With only 2 courses complete, everyone at the table was already full, and we haven't even gotten to the entree.  Now, this was a surprise.  Our entrees seemed to be full sized entrees, which can be around the $28.  I couldn't believe it.  I got the Pigs and Chips option and the pork chop was really good, the pork belly (2) was mouth-wateringly delicious, and the sausage was great.  This was all presented on a cutting board which kinda gave me the feeling of being at home with my grandma in the kitchen.  There were also rosemary chips which I didn't get to eat a lot of since I was full.  My friends got the half chicken and whitefish respectively and loved theirs.  We couldn't even finish so we had half of our entrees wrapped up.  They gave us our leftovers in very chic takeaway boxes with handles.  Finally, the dessert came.  I got the pear cake and it came in a jar.  It was delicious.  Everything was delicious and I feel like we robbed off the restaurant with the amount we paid for restaurant week.  The presentation for everything was really interesting since they seemed to want to give a rustic feel to the food like cutting boards instead of plates or jars instead of bowls.  You also forgot you were in a hotel restaurant.  The service was impeccable, the food was really great, and the ambiance was amazing.  I would definitely come here again for restaurant week or if someone else was paying.  This is a great option to dining on the Mag mile that's not a chain restaurant.   Come for restaurant week if you can, but if you have the funds, come here just to dine.  The experience is well worth it.",0.9987,0.779,0.21,0.012,0.6482625482625484

For our entree, we split the Confit Duck Flatbread and the Angus Beef Brisket Melt.  The Brisket was AMAZING!  A huge portion, unless you have a big appetite, remember to share, homemade pickels were good (not a huge pickle fan but def enjoyed these), the bread was even flavorful!  I was not a huge fan of the Confit Duck Flatbread, the duck was shredded which made the already gamey meat quite tough, and the apple cider vinagarette was very very sweet.   All in all we had a good experience, the food was good, and the prices were decent for downtown Chicago.  We will return again for dinner next time.",0.9971,0.696,0.281,0.022,0.6974338624338626

We got there early to enjoy a drink at the bar, and the men in our group were pleasantly surprised to see what a great craft beer list was available to them. Upon being seated, we were informed how the prix fixe menu worked for the evening and then had a difficult time making final decisions for our meals because everything looked so delicious. I rarely order steak, but I decided this was a great excuse to go all out, and it was a fantastic meal, adorned with soft potatoes as the perfect side . I was a bit full already from the fabulous cheese and meat plate and exotic apple salad that came first, but we came prepared to eat well and boy did we ever. While waiting for our dessert to come (salted chocolate caramel tart AKA heaven) the chef came to our table to inquire about our dining experience and asked us to take a walk with him back to the kitchen. A little taken aback, we followed him to the meat locker where he went on to explain how they store and prepare the meat, support local farmers, and prepare the food for tasting. Most impressive was his story about his vision for the restaurant and how it came to fruition.

The bread basket they start you with has what appear to be luxurious home made wheat thins that are delicious! The burger was the best sit down restaurant burger I have had in the last year.  The burger was fat, juicy, and nicely charred on the outside.  Instead of fries, they met my vegetable request and gave me a side of carrots, brocollini, and asparagus that was perfectly steamed and salted.     The initial reason I came was to try the PB&J waffle panini.   This is a very novel concept.   I believe they use homemade waffles, fill them with peanut butter and jelly, then press the waffle slices together in a panini press.  I thought this was good, but it wasn't as good as I was expecting it to be.  Either my expectations were too high or the burger was so good it overshadowed the waffle sandwich.

2011-06-26,5.0,"Excellent experience here.  We're generally a little leery of restaurants located in hotels, but this one was great.  Starting with the service: we dined on a Saturday evening, and brought our young (under 10) son. Sometimes we are treated like second-class citizens at nice restaurants when we bring our son, but not at this one. We ordered one cheese, one ""shareable"" (roasted eggplant with flatbread crackers), and one ""taste"" - apple fritters.  The ""shareable"" and the ""taste"" were delicious and unique, and interestingly presented.  The cheese was okay - I think we a got a piece that was heavy near the rind. The children's menu offered the unusual combination of being tasty AND healthy (our son gobbled up the organic vanilla yogurt with fresh berries), and the chicken ""fingers"" weren't the usual deep-fried variety. The mains were good.  Our entrees were the roasted half-chicken, and the rootbeer ham.  The chicken came with an interesting white bean stew (and delicious baby carrots in 3 colors - orange, yellow, and purple).

2011-05-07,4.0,"My fiance and I just dined here this morning, and wow-very very good place.   We have been looking for weeks for different venues to host a very intimate reception brunch for our wedding in two weeks, and this is the place. It is on the 4th floor of the Omni Hotel, has a very classy ambiance to it, but is not stiff where it might make somebody feel like they need a credit reference just to get into the place. We were seated immediately by what we thought was our server(it was close to 11:30), given menus, and had a gorgeous view overlooking the Mag Mile.  It really was breathtaking. One of our only two gripes came after we were seated... for about 10 minutes (if not longer) we were just sitting there waiting for our server to wait on us.  Finally a different server (different from the one who seated us) came over to us and asked if we had been helped yet.  After that the service was ok... nothing great, but at least better than waiting 10 to 12 minutes to be asked what we wanted. They came out with bread and coffee for us. Al though 9 times out of 10 coffee is just coffee, this roast from 676 is AMAZING-I dont know if it is a special blend, or just regular Maxwells, etc, but this was damn fine coffee. The bread at first seemed like nothing special-a few pieces of plain white bread, two large triscuit like crackers, and what appeared to be a either a piece of cheese bread or sourdough (not sure).  While the white bread and the cracker were nothing special, WOW-that cheese (or sourdough) bread really had flavor to it.  We ordered another basket just to fight over that bread alone.  It really is good. As for what we ordered, we ordered two breakfast plates with a lunch appetizer.   I ordered the Caramel Apple French Toast, while my fiance ordered the Prairie Honey Waffle.  For an appetizer we ordered the Miller Farm Amish Chicken wings in a Lemon Sauce. Let's start with the wings:  A- I was expecting something run of the mill, but the flavor just came to life.  The portion was HUGE, layered with some carrots and celery, and the lemon sauce was actually very sweet... my fiance and I almost had a boxing match right there trying to decide who would get the last one.  Very good! Next up:  The French Toast:  A- Like the wings, the portion was big, which is important to me because I would rather have to take home a doggie bag as opposed to still feeling hungry after a meal.  Al though it was only 3 slices, the slices were quite large, and the caramelized apple sprinkled over the toast even added to my feeling of being full once I finished the meal.  The taste was plentiful, the maple syrup was like a party in my mouth, and (quite importantly) I didn't feel like I wasted my money for what is an actually pricey item (I will have more to say about the price in just a bit). Finally, my fiances Waffle:  Undecided (either an A-, or a D-). Allow me to explain. The waffle had some whipped cream on top and a cinnamon and caramel flavor to it.  It tasted very very good and my fiance loved it, hence the A- part of the grade. But here is the problem:  It's just one waffle, and for $16!  True-It was a tad larger than most waffles, but still.  My fiance and I are not big people or anything, but we dont weigh 50 lbs either.  For $16 we could have gone to Lou Mitchells and gotten two breakfasts that would have made us unbuckle our belts just in order to breathe before leaving.  Hence, the D-. I think the waffle episode is just an isolated incident, however.  We got to see several other entrees from the people around us, and all of their portions were quite generous, so I think this was just a case of ordering the wrong thing.  Still tasty though. As for the total price, while it was pricey, and while I wish my fiance got more on her plate, this was really worth it.  However, it might not be the place for others.  Al though the food quality is something special, you have to remember you are dining in a hotel... expect hotel prices.  If you want more bang for you buck, there are better ways to spend $56.  However, if you like ambiance mixed into food quality (which is what I am going for with our wedding reception because I want both great tasting filling food AND a memorable decor) then this is really at the top of the food chain. I couldnt be happier with this place acting as our reception locale.  It really is something unique and memorable.  :)",0.9979,0.825,0.136,0.039,0.5245846900013569

2011-04-28,3.0,"Strange how close this restaurant is to my office and I never had the chance to go. Well tonight, I finally did. Thanks to a special event where Bordeaux wine makers came & showcased their wines, we had our own prix fixe menu, with 2 choices each for appetizer and dessert, and the short rib entree.  I started with the tomato and Michigan white bean soup, which was beautifully presented and boldly flavored. I usually shy away from the strong taste of goat cheese, but the goat cheese on the long ""crouton"" actually blends in perfectly with the strong soup. I found only 1 bean in my soup, which was actually a plus in my book as I'm not much of a bean person. My only quibble with the soup was how dangerous the long crisp crouton was, perched precariously on the bowl. I made a big mess around my plate when I tried to transfer it (ok...I'm just trying to blame someone else for my own clumsiness). The short rib was one big hunk of meat, and oh-so-tender. The chef later came out and said they were shooting for ""spoon-only"" texture, no knife&fork needed. I totally agree. It had a beautiful & sweet sauce on it, paired with rainbow chard, sweet parsnip puree and some roasted root veggies. Chef even printed out several recipes on request. I'm just gonna say it had 15 ingredients, of which 7 are stocked in my kitchen. All in all, very impressed.  The only letdown was the dessert: chocolate truffle mousse cake. The ""mousse"" was heavy and flat, and the chocolate cake way too dense (though moist). Having had quite a few excellent chocolate desserts in a row in the past 2 months, I couldn't get through half of this one.

Third course: - S'mores Pudding (me): I am secretly a six year old who could eat s'mores all day.  The toasted marshmallow was the perfect topping for this chocolate pudding/graham cracker concoction. - Vanilla and Cinnamon Creme Brulee (my budday): When I come back to 676, I'm getting this.  My friend got two little dishes of creme brulee - one vanilla and one cinnamon.  Two chocolate hazelnut cookies came on the side.

2011-02-26,4.0,"My fiancee and I wanted to go out for Chicago Restaurant Week, and I chose a place on Michigan Avenue, so we could stroll a bit.  I had never heard of 676 in 14 years of living in Chicago, but I really liked the menu the chef had prepared for Restaurant Week.  He incorporates a lot of local foods, including meats from Miller's and Slagel Family Farm.  My fiancee was game for the unknown.  When we arrived, we did have to wait several minutes for the hostess to appear, but discovered it was because it is a long walk through the bar area to the seating area.  We weren't in a hurry, so I didn't mind.  We were seated in front of the window, but the table was placed so that only one person has the view.  The ambiance of the restaurant was very pleasant, with a big open kitchen (which I love). Our waiter was fantastic.  He helped a great deal with the wine selection, being honest.  We wanted a bottle of red, but they didn't have a lot of more affordable selections (under $50 a bottle), except for those from South America.  We were wavering between a Malbec and Carmenere, and he had tried them both and gave his honest assessment.  The Malbec we went with was good - smooth, mellow and medium-bodied.  A good drinking wine, which is just how he described it.  We enjoyed it.   For starters, we ordered the 676 salad and the shrimp flatbread.  The salad was tasty - the blueberry dressing was not overdone and the crunchy candied almonds contrasted nicely with a very fine quality goat cheese.  My fiancee liked it, even though he has this thing against fruit in his salads.  The shrimp flatbread was delish!  The bread itself is airy and light, and the cream cheese from Zingerman's in Ann Arbor was smooth and rich.  It is a huge portion and can be an entree, almost like a personal pizza ""light"".   For our entrees, I ordered the Goose Island Root Beer Ham with pork loin, baked apple slices, mustard greens and a mustard vin sauce.  There were also these baby onions that burst in your mouth with a satisfying sweetness...I loved my dish.  My fiancee doesn't like cured meats and felt the ham tasted too close to bacon.  For me it was like a thick piece of good Canadian bacon with a slight sweetness from the root beer.  I liked the contrasting bitterness of the mustard greens and mustard sauce.  The pork loin was perfectly cooked and quite moist and flavorful. My fiancee ordered the Open Range Chicago Strip Steak.  The kitchen cooked it perfectly to medium rare, and it was full of spice and very tasty.  It was a big piece of steak.  The popcorn was actually good - and garlicky.  The polenta was creamy and the shitake mushrooms were a cool addition.  The baby onions also made an appearance in his dish and again were heavenly. For dessert, my fiancee ordered the honey ice cream and I had the carrot cake (again with Zingerman's cream cheese frosting).  I have to say I was disappointed with the carrot cake.  Definitely not what I was expecting.  It seemed to be undercooked on the inside, and there were way too many raisins.  I like my carrot cake traditional - with layers of cream cheese frosting.  This one had a little bit smeared on top.  The crispy cinnamon sugar ""chips"" on top were yummy, and I dipped those in the cream cheese frosting and didn't finish dessert.  Not like me!  My fiancee's ice cream was yummy, but the caramel they layered into the mason jar froze and was hard and difficult to eat.   Overall, I would say it was a pleasant discovery.  The chef can work on the desserts a bit, but the food is inventive, local and wonderfully prepared.  I have no complaints about the service, either.  We took an hour and a half for dinner, which I think is a perfect amount of time.  Someone else complained that the salads took 10 minutes to arrive.  That is not that long!  Enjoy your drink and nibble on the fresh baked bread or crackers they place on the table.  A meal should be an experience, otherwise - go to McDonald's!",0.9993,0.766,0.198,0.036,0.5964102564102565

The only good one was my short ribs and I have to say, it was stellar.  My husbands steak was overcooked with little taste as well as the chicken my friend ordered. The sides were all great, but overall oversalted.  Dessert however was absolutely delicious.   The manager was great, was apologetic and did everything he could short of cooking the food himself to make it right.

Salad was good and fresh, so no complaint on the taste- Entrees: the short rib, it only took about 8 minutes for it to come out, so not bad-It was very tender but it needed a lot of pepper to give it a seasoned taste- Dessert: My brownie came as 2 sticks, like Twix bars in a mason jar, bottom filled with some whipped cream and I think caramel and I had to use a spoon that was almost the size of the jar to get it out, kind of pain and I got stuff all over my hands- I know I won't dine here again, nor will I recommend it, was the food bad, no, is it memorable, no did it take forever...yes! Just very plain yet good hotel food for those who aren't used to the good places downtown to eat at- The whole time I was mad that I didn't go to Mercadito or Merlo on Maple, places I wanted to try and have a feeling it would have been better-",-0.8791,0.804,0.088,0.108,0.5465517241379311

2011-02-11,2.0,"I went here last night with a good friend for drinks and appetizers after work.  Everything was good, but they did up our gratuity from about 16% to 20% reflected on our credit card statements .   I do not like this practice. We left the tip based on the service received. A 16% tip was a proper tip with all things considered.  We had to ask for water after ordering a spicey dish. We had been there over an hour at that point. Another appetizer never arrived. On their behalf, they brought the appetizer, once reminded, and did waive the cost. The waitress was attentive with the drinks and very knowledgeable about the menu items.  Still, if an establishment is going to raise a gratuity then they should put it on the check before payment is made and more importantly:  The service should be flawless.  Having to remind our server about items ordered when they didn't show up is not what I would call flawless service.  It shows polishing is needed and the tip reflected it. The experience was enjoyable overall, but I won't hurry back based on this practice. It's the Magnificient Mile. The 676 Restaurant & Bar is not the only game in town or even on the block.",0.9585,0.856,0.115,0.029,0.5041666666666667

2010-09-22,4.0,"I can't speak on the restaurant, but I did try the outdoor cafe. I ordered a turkey wrap and a pomegranate margarita that came in the form of a pomegranate martini, but that didn't bother me any. The food and drink came far quicker than I thought it would. And it looked pretty. I appreciate an attractive meal from time to time. I'm pretty traditional, so reading some of the ingredients for their dishes made me pause at first, but I took a chance. The turkey wrap had apple on it...I typically keep my fruit and my sandwiches separate, but this worked. It blended well with the honey mustard to give the wrap a mild sweet flavor, and it made the sandwich taste even fresher. The martini consisted of POM juice, Patron, something else I forget, and cilantro salt.  Cilantro salt. Cilantro? Word?? It actually worked, gave the drink a kick, a little spiciness that I was digging.  So yay for taking chances! Maybe one of these days I'll venture inside to try the actual restaurant.",0.9877,0.797,0.19,0.012,0.6194444444444444
2010-09-18,1.0,"I came to 676 with a friend visiting from out of town. We wanted to go out for a nice expensive dinner on the Mile and really have a special night. We would have had a better dinner at McDonald's. The food was terrible. Completely inedible. When we complained to our waiter, he did nothing but take our plates. When we complained to the restaurant they asked us to come back again. I think not. My friend ordered a medium rare steak. What she got was a hunk of meat that looked like it had been hacked up by a machete then cooked all day. It was burned beyond what even a novice chef would call medium-rare or even medium-well. We ordered a lobster appetizer and it smelled like rotten fish. I ordered a chicken pasta dish and had what tasted like dry, microwaved chicken in Ragu al fredo sauce. The service was awful. There was only one other table but they still couldn't keep our water glasses full. We skipped desert and went to the Signature Room for a night cap. We should have had dinner there. The price would have been the same but the food would have been good. 676 is just terrible. Try Grand Luxe Cafe for a similar style of food but properly cooked. Update: After being contacted by the owner more than once suggesting I reviewed the wrong restaurant, I checked their menu. It seems to have changed greatly but I know I ate at 676 at the Omni hotel. I went over a year ago and the overcooked steak, the lobster/asparagus appetizer served in an eggshell, and the chicken pasta dish (it had some other name like chicken carbonara) were all served. They've been offering me gift cards to come back in and give them another chance. Sorry, someone should have acted like they cared on that night when I first complained. We even left notes on the receipt hoping someone in  power would read them. I left out the worst part...they upped my tip to 20% without my consent. I had to call the next day and tell them to lower it back down and that while the poor food was my main concern, the absolute disregard for customer service led to the small tip. I will not ever eat at this place again. Maybe they've changed but my experience was bad and I will not remove this review. People should know about my experience. They seem truly apologetic so try them if you must, but don't say I didn't warn you.",-0.4833,0.77,0.113,0.117,0.543747795414462

Although the food is actually quite good, the drinks take the prize.  Many original and properly balanced cocktails not featuring sweet and sour or other mixes.  Light and refreshing flavors such as green tea and cucumber.  The drinks are not as reasonably priced as the food which ranges from $3 for tastes and $15 for entrees.  The cucumber gimlet, my favorite, costs a pricey $13.  However, there is a reasonably price special daily:  Twists on traditional cocktails such as bloody mary and mimosa. My suggestion is to go to Delilah's beforehand for a very inexpensive buzz and great selections of beer, scotch, and whiskey for the boys.  Don't worry girls, the punk bartender was more than willing to whip up a few fruity concoctions that were very good with a $3 price tag.",0.9879,0.755,0.218,0.027,0.5326785714285714

2009-10-22,3.0,I add this to my list of boring names for a restaurant/bar. Maybe about 15 years ago it was trendy to name a restaurant related to its address but now it's just lazy. The restaurant is located in the Omni Hotel. You need to take the elevator to the 4th floor. The decor is nice yet plain but could be so much better to be congruent with the view and large space. It could be so much more romantic or hip after they serve dinner if they dim the lights - just to start. The drinks are good. I had a mojito. My date ordered one of their signature fruity martinis. She seemed to enjoy it. She also ordered the foie gras and loved it. Overall it was quiet and the staff was older. It's a nice place but I got the feeling that people over 40 would enjoy it more.,0.9869,0.765,0.206,0.028,0.5826190476190477

Tomato and White Bean Soup: I liked better than I thought.  Truly liked the chef just mixed together two classic soup styles.  Really good. Seared Atlantic Salmon:  Highly overcooked and dry.  Amateurish at best. Filet - Very good piece of meat. Navel Orange Tart for dessert: Boring, not a way to finish a meal. Service was quite good, and I have to admit that the view from my table (overlooking Michigan Avenue) made for a nice evening.  From previous reviews, I know that this restaurant has great potential - I just felt like they went ""cafeteria"" on me during Restaurant Week.",0.9941,0.673,0.273,0.054,0.5915632183908045

I don't know, I just prefer a bit more off the beaten path...but, alas I was invited for a networking dinner, and of course with the Restaurant Week menus all over the city (my only night I took advantage of it), this was a good option.  The strangest dish of the evening was the salmon over risotto. It was so citrusy it was all I could taste. It kind of icked me out, and honestly when I think back to the meal all I can do is make that sour face you get when you get a chunk of lemon. Yeah, that face. It kind of marred the whole meal, in my honest estimation. However the filet with ravioli over the top was delicious, and the tart at the end very large and creamy. (face slowly unpuckers) So, for.... One glass of prosecco, one glass of wine, coffee, Diet Coke (god, I'm a beverage champion, eh?), the RW menu (3 courses)...and an added 20 perecent gratuity it was $80. A bit pricey for a random Tuesday evening, and I much rather would have spent it elsewhere...but, the company was stellar, and the service was nothing short of impeccable, so they win points there most definitely.  It's a hotel restaurant, and if you are staying (or live) downtown, it's definitely a decent option.

Then, our next course came looking much larger than before, leaving us with high hopes. When we all realized at the same time that it was actually all FOUR courses at once- each course about the size of a plum, we were pretty disappointed...Three stars because the food tasted fine, but it was a meal for midgets!

At least I had no idea and I consider myself ""in the know"" when it comes to the restaurant scene in Chicago. The $32 prix fixe menu of 6 courses (yes, that's 6!) for restaurant week lured me in with a group of lovely ladies.  I've been eating out for Chicago restaurant week every night this week so for the sake of fitting into my jeans I decided ahead of time I'd opt out of the 6 course menu and order something from their regular menu.  Of course when I got there I was convinced that the courses were really small (really just samples) and to try it. And I""m always one to succumb to peer pressure when it comes to food. I may just need to buy bigger jeans... I ended up being very happy with my 6 course menu...and it really was the perfect portion size.  Here are all the details: Hot Rock Shrimp: got to cook my own shrimp, which was fun. And tasty! 676 Green Salad: Full of almonds and goat cheese- yum! Tomato and White Bean Soup: My favorite dish of the evening! Seared Atlantic Salmon:  Had a very strong citrus taste, which I didn't mind, but not for you if you're not a citrus lover Chicken (was supposed to be filet, but I swapped it for chicken): Also delish  Navel Orange Tart for dessert: I didn't think I was a tart person, but maybe I am because this totally hit the spot! The restaurant was pretty much empty (like i said...most people don't know about it) so we got lots of attention from our servers, although I thought there was a bit too much time between the shrimp course and everything else. Then again, we were a large party and when that's the case I always expect things to move along a bit slower.   They were extremely nice in letting us switch up things from the prix fixe dinner.  Examples: chicken instead of filet for me, vegetarian options for a vegetarian member of our party, and a chocolate dessert instead of the tart for someone else.

We shared an appetizer. The Lump Crab Cakes - Grilled knob onion rémoulade and shaved corn succotash.  They were very flavorful.  We also shared a 676 Green Salad - Candied almond, capriole chevre and wild blueberry vinaigrette.  WOW!   What awesome combination!   The vinaigrette complimented the goat cheese so well!   For our entrees, my wife had the Grilled Maine Lobster - Fava bean, corn, heirloom tomato mâche and grilled tomato vinaigrette.   For me, it was a little mushy, as if overcooked, or perhaps previously frozen. She didn't complain, but it was my detection.   For my entree, I had the signature Bone-In Ribeye - Smoked onion barley, shiitake mushroom and truffle-tomato salad.  Holy Crap!!!   This has to be one of the city's best cuts!   It is a LARGE, tender, and flavorful as ever!  And the smoked onion barley side.....I could take a bath in the stuff!!!!  It complimented the steak so well.  Shameful to say, I couldn't finish the steak and had to take it home.   I made my wife and I steak and eggs for breakfast this morning, so yeah, it is LARGE, as I said.  Dessert!  We shared the Chocolate Forte with raspberry sauce and hot chocolate shot with a homemade chocolate marshmallow merengue.  WOW!  Get it!

I have high expectations for restaurants on Michigan Ave. I had a 7:00 dinner reservation with my mom and fiancee on Saturday and probably could have been a walk in. The dinner area was completely empty, but there were plenty of people at the bar/lounge. The decor was relaxing and I like how it's situated directly above Michigan Ave. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. I just hate the he carded me (and told me I kind of looked like a teenager) and didn't card my fiance (he is the same age as me)....maybe he thought my mom and fiance were a couple!?! Anyways...   For our appetizers we had the Lobster Spring Rolls and Grilled Artichoke Fondue (i.e. dip). The spring rolls were incredibly delicious and were by far my favorite item. I probably could have made this dish my dinner, I'd have to order more than one though. The artichoke fondue had a strong lemon flavor, which I liked, but the flat bread chips could have broken my teeth, I used the regular table bread instead. I also had the Five Onion Soup. It was really good, but not my favorite ever - it does comes close though. For dinner I had the Stuffed Amish Chicken. It was stuffed with red bell pepper, wilted spinach, and cheese. Very good and flavorful. The fiance and mother had the Bone-In Ribeye. The restaurant prides itself on having the best one in the city. I'm not sure if its the best, but it's definitely one of the largest - my mom and fiance probably could have split one. I will say that the leftovers were awesome! This place deserves 3.5 stars.

They're not exceptionaly trained at making cocktails, but they sure get by. This place came highly recommended from a few friends of mine and i'll continue to go back. They are really inventive with their food menu. The soups are extermely well made, and the desserts...just amazing.",0.9741,0.762,0.238,0.0,0.6365432098765432
2008-03-07,5.0,"My kind of town, Chicago is... And 676 is my kind of restaurant. Lucky me, I got to have two meals there. Lunch on a Friday and dinner on a Saturday. Occupying a nicely decorated corner on the fourth floor of the Omni Hotel, 676 offers prime views of the always bustling Michigan Ave. The dining area has a domed ceiling with a faux sky that slowly changes from one shade to another, and is bordered by the bar area and a cozy seating area with overstuffed chairs. ( yelp.com/biz_photos/_NaP… ) Impeccable service from James during lunch, complete with sightseeing tips and plenty of good cheer. What did I have? I started with an incredible cup of coffee, presented in a huge mug with a freeform saucer and dainty spoon. Next came the smoked chicken soup ( yelp.com/biz_photos/_NaP… ) with herb dumplings, generous in portion, complex and layered in flavor, but not overpowering, and accompanied by a delightfully arranged basket of bread complete with a covered ramekin of butter ( yelp.com/biz_photos/_NaP… ) placed on the table and uncovered with an elegant flourish by my most adept server. The soup was more than filling, but I had also ordered the turkey and bacon on foccacia with an herbed cream cheese spread. It arrived sliced in half, and nicely arranged with a cast iron dish of the house kettle chips. (  yelp.com/biz_photos/_NaP… ) I took as many bites as I could, all the while eyeing the lump crabcakes(  yelp.com/biz_photos/_NaP… )  and shrimp flatbread ( yelp.com/biz_photos/_NaP… ) my boss had ordered. James checked with us multiple times during our meal, always smiling, and the other servers made sure our water glasses were never empty, and that my coffee was always to the brim! It was a wonderful meal, and gave me the energy I needed to go and explore Chicago! I even followed some of the advice James had given me, thank goodness, because I got some amazing photos.   Dinner the following evening was just as impressive in terms of food, but the service was lacking. Not lack of attention, or anything like that, but more a lack of experience? I just don't like presumptuous waiters that interrupt me mid-sentence. Maybe I was just tired and cranky. But not too tired to thoroughly enjoy my savory beef empanadas, so crispy and perfect. And definitely not too cranky to appreciate the bites I tried of the rib-eye steak my boss ordered. Such succulent falling-off-the-bone goodness, rich with flavor, crusted with an Argentinean remoulade and topped with chorizo mashed potatoes. Heaven on a plate you say? No, that would be the chocolate torte with a shot of spicy hot chocolate that I had for dessert.",0.9976,0.76,0.198,0.042,0.6375322997416021

2006-07-31,5.0,"I found the oasis I was looking for during a hot hectic week in Chicago.  I just wanted to be alone with a cocktail and some decent food, so I rather matter-of-factly walked into the Omni Hotel off Michigan Ave a couple of evenings ago.  The elevator took me up 3 or 4 stories above street level to 676.  The blue and gold suede couches, faux sky blue ceiling, high back chairs w/ crisp white linens and a sea of lanterns all gave me a kinda Alice in Wonderland needs a drink feel.  I was alone so I ate at the bar.  The bartender was extremely attentive as a server and quite congenial considering the restaurant was pretty full.  My meal was great.  I had a clear broth based clam chowder with green onions and purposely burnt popcorn that was a really great starter.  For an entre I opted for the special of the day which were short ribs w/ braised root vegetables and some type of spice chorizo.  I found honest to goodness ""comfort food"" in an upscale hotel in downtown Chicago.  Needless to say my quest to decompress was quite successful thanks to 676.",0.9831,0.817,0.163,0.02,0.5149134199134199
2005-08-12,3.0,"Cielo means ""sky"" in Italian, and this restaurant in the Omni has a cool blue sky painted on the ceiling. It is not on the street level, so this gives the place an exclusive ""guests only"" feel to it. Italian food is the way to go here, though it is nothing overly memorable. Perhaps I have been spoiled by all the Italian food I have eaten in Italy. Cielo has recently been reinvented as 676 Restaurant and Bar with a more Americanized menu.",0.4215,0.953,0.047,0.0,0.3888888888888889
