It was relatively empty (it was also a Tuesday night).  The waiter, oh the waiter, how I wish I could get that service everywhere!

2017-06-27,5.0,"I cannot say enough great things about The Capital Grille!  My husband made a reservation online for our 10 year anniversary. He had taken his mom to the Rosemont location for her birthday a few years ago and said we would go there sometime because the food was outstanding. When you make a reservation, it asks if the visit is for a special occasion. He selected Anniversary. When we arrived, the front desk greeted us and asked if we were there for a special occasion. We said yes, our anniversary. They both said congratulations and happy anniversary. Then we were shown to our table. It was a corner booth near the kitchen. The booth was decorated with heart confetti and a card was sitting on the table for us! The card said Happy Anniversary and was signed by the staff! Our waitress, Valerie Delfin (ask for her, she's FANTASTIC! I will forever ask for her to be our waitress!) came over and wished us a Happy Anniversary, as well as every employee that walked past our table. She went over the menu and brought out the drink menu. They will select a wine or cocktail to best suit your meal if you ask.  We both ordered the 10 oz filet. I know I'm committing a terrible crime, but I ordered mine well done. It was not burnt, chewy, or overcooked. It was amazing! Definitely the best steak I've ever had. We ordered the Soy Glazed Brussels Sprouts with Bacon and the Potatoes Au Gratin. WOW! The potatoes were very rich, but delicious. The brussels sprouts were, again, the best I've ever had. After dinner, Valerie brought out the dessert menu. We told her there was no way we could do dessert and she told us to look it over anyway. Then she comes back with a tray of desserts, ON THE HOUSE! She tricked us! The tray said, in chocolate, Happy Anniversary. It came with a mini cheesecake and a dark chocolate brownie, and fresh fruit. Just when we were talking about how amazing they were and how much they went above and beyond the level of customer service, Valerie comes out with 2 glasses of champagne as well!  The service was OUTSTANDING. The food was OUTSTANDING. I know that we will go out of our way to go to the Chicago location for our future special occasions.

I don't typically order steak at restaurants because I can make a pretty mean steak myself but I will order the ribeye here from time to time because it's just that good. My most commonly ordered items here are the lobster roll for lunch and the lobster/crab cake for dinner. Both are delicious for a very reasonable price. You get a ton of fresh lobster in a toasted brioche. They don't put much dressing on it and it's just a bunch of lobster meat. The same can be said for their lobster/crab cake. There's very little filler and just made with big chunks of crab and lobster meat.

However, when you're going to a $$$ establishment, you know that it's going to be a decent chunk of change. What I'll say is that the price is well worth it. The Capital Grille really delivers on what you get. I ordered three courses, an appetizer, salad, and a main course. All three blew me out of the water. The tuna tartar was wonderful, coming with two delicious side sauces: one sweet, the other spicy. Next, i ordered a kale salad with a peanut vinaigrette. This was phenomenal; I love a salad with a good crunch to it.  For the main course, I ordered a Chilean sea bass that was also wonderful. The service and ambiance was another key aspect to the experience. He restaurant has a very classic vibe to it with wood all around, red seats at round tables, and easy listening swing classics playing over the speakers. The servers wear jackets and frequently come by to check on you. The busing staff was also extremely friendly and my glass of water was never empty.

The actions of the Capital Grille employee is what put matters into motion.

In all seriousness we went during a weekend trip to Chicago, a city I LOVE and one my fiancé had never been to. Chicago is such a foodie town it was hard to decide which places to take him but this was suggested by a few people so we made reservations.  We decided to forgo drinks because we needed some recovery time from the previous night but I did see a lot of people had ordered their house specialty the stoli doli so it must be good. We both ordered one of the specials which was the surf and turf option of a filet and lobster tail. Mine had the Kona rub with shallot sauce and his was cooked cowboy style which meant it had a dry rub, onion strings and horseradish. Both were delicious but we both agreed mine was better. The rub on his steak made it a bit too salty but trust me it was still delicious! We shared the lobster Mac and cheese and it did NOT disappoint. I am not a big M&C person but there are only a few items I would push a baby stroller over to get to and this has been added to the list right next to the coveted spot held by Thin Mints.

The bread was fresh and the variety made it interesting: just enough of each kind but enough different kinds that you didn't get tired of eating the same bread (we're kind of bread enthusiasts).  We started with clam chowder (pretty rich, but also pretty standard), then got salmon & the 14 oz. steak. They offered a $10 add-on for a lobster tail and we took it....what we didn't process from our waiter was that it's 2-3 oz. lobster tail and that is tiny....tl;dr don't get the add-on lobster tail but that was our mistake because the waiter definitely made that disclaimer. Salmon was juicy and so soft, and ohmygosh the size. It isn't those places that give you a plate twice the size of your face but you could eat the food in one bite. This salmon took time to conquer. Same with the steak, that was a LOT of meat. Green peas (side) were ok, mashed potato was pretty good.  Desserts: the chocolate espresso flourless cake...texture is more like a mousse and dang it is rich (read: bitter). The taste was pretty overwhelming since it was toward the end of our meal and we had gotten really full at that point, and we ended up not finishing it. The crème brûlée on the other hand, was really delicious. It was borderline too sweet, but compared to the chocolate cake it was much easier to go down.

Desert came shortly after and our bill was dropped at the same time. She didn't bother to ask if we wanted anything else, maybe another bottle of wine or how our meal was. Shortly after, we signed our checks and she came and picked up the bill holder.  All fine up until this point, less than impressive service, but wait...

We started our meal with a lobster bisque and white cheddar potato soup and a field greens salad. All were delicious, especially the bisque had giant chunks of fresh lobster. I had a filet mignon and my friend had the bone in NY strip. Both were perfectly cooked and delicious, but I would order the NY strip if I go back. We had mashed potatoes and creamed spinach for our sides. The potatoes were delicious. I am not a big fan of most creamed foods, so I can't judge that.

I had my boyfriends 50th bday party there, and just this evening, while at a doctors appointment in the city decided to meet him for an impromptu meal at the Capital Grill.  There is construction going on in their building so it is basically blocked off with a fence/construction sight, making it more difficult to navigate into the restaurant and find the valet parking.  But make the effort people! As always, their food was spot on.  Our favorite is the Filet with Lobster and it is cooked to perfection every single time.  We usually begin with the wedge salad but I've had other starters before, each one has been wonderful.  The side of Lobster Mac and Cheese is indulgent but also worth it!  Time and time again, they prove to be top notch.  Our server tonight, Rich Dorgan, did an exceptional job making sure everything was to our liking, but not being too intrusive.  He also brought a complimentary dessert, which we were so surprised about but he explained our meal took longer than normal because one of the lobster tails didn't come out as well as they wanted and they cooked it again.  We didn't even notice, we were enjoying the dining experience. But so much appreciated it when he took care like that.  I would recommend The Capital Grill if you want to enjoy tasty well prepared food, great service and a nice ambiance.  I would not let the temporary construction scare you away.

I called a few hours before to reserve a table just incase (it was a Monday so I probably didn't need to, but if you go on other days, you should definitely set a reservation. We went here specifically for the lobster Mac and cheese. It's my favorite. Others try to imitate but they never get it as good as it is here. As expected, it was delicious. There was a little less lobster meat in it than we normally get, but it could have just been the luck of the spoon (or lack of luck).  The dinner bread/butter they bring out was delicious. My favorite is the brown bread. I don't know what it's called but it's so damn good. The big patty of butter they bring out has a light rock salt garnish and it comes out at room temp so you aren't ripping the bread, because the butter is too hard/cold. Big kudos on the room temp butter. We also both got a glass of wine. Our server was very nice (I wish I could remember her name). She was knowledgeable about their wine list and was attentive to our needs. I asked for her to take our pic and she happily obliged.  Even though we were what was probably her smallest check of the night, she treated us as we were her biggest check. Also, when you tell them it's a birthday celebration, they leave out a happy birthday card and put HB confetti on the table, which is super nice.

I dined at lunch and sometimes, even at top line restaurants, the service isn't quite as sharp as dinner. Not at this Cap Grille! The food was perfect, no compromised  on cut of meat with the tenderloin salad which was cooked perfectly and a wonderful choice. The greens fresh, the blu cheese and bacon generous. The experience was SO GOOD that I returned the next day and had the same meal.  At first, I was disappointed because I wasn't served by the same amazing server, Heather, then Diego stepped up and matched her perfection. The service at this restaurant really is superb.  On my second visit, I was even one of those obnoxious diners. I requested a table change, ordered while on a conference call, told them I was expecting a guest who never showed...certainly a diner a server could justifiably roll their eyes at, not Diego. He treated me like a queen. You may have looked at other reviews I've written and think, this is out of character, person is rarely this generous with reviews. You're right, I'm always frank, brutally honest and tell it like it is. This is the Yelp  review real deal as I see it. In NYC, I rarely review the restaurants I adore and if I review a restaurant, I am prudent because I don't want my favorite, yet undiscovered gem to become unavailable to me because I've given it a superior review. The restaurants in NYC are so small, that if there is one rave review, the entire neighborhood flocks there and becomes a regular. Sorry wonderful restaurants in NYC, this is your burden.

Having just eaten at The Capital Grille, I can say that this is not a first quality steakhouse.   My entree, a 22 oz. bone-in rib eye, had so much seasoning put on it that the taste of the steak itself disappeared.  It also was cut thin, to fill the whole plate, which diminished the taste.  The creamed spinach was tasteless.  The creme brulee was a bit grainy and totally bland.  The wine, which I know sells at $8 - $10 a bottle retail, was priced at $39 (this itself is not unusual, but still irritates).

2016-03-13,2.0,"We went for a date night on a Saturday evening.  First, be aware that their policy is to send people to the bar in order to sell booze because when we checked in they told us it would be at least 10 minutes to get our table ready so we should grab drinks at the bar, but when we said we'd wait, they seated us right away.  Don't like this.  For dinner, I ordered the special filet with lobster tails. I asked how many oz the meat is because I was contemplating between that and the 10 oz filet on the menu.  Waiter told me 8 oz.  What they brought me were 2 small 4 oz meats.  But I didn't order medallions!  Everybody knows that one large piece of meat is better than several smaller pieces, so I wouldn't think that a good restaurant would do something like that.  I sent it back and they brought a new meal with one steak which was much better.  For desert we ordered the warm chocolate cake.  That was very disappointing!  I used to buy cakes like these from Sarah Lee years ago, you would just pop them in the microwave to heat up the chocolate.  Every good steakhouse has their signature deserts, just try the chocolate cakes at Babette's (top notch), RPM, RPM Italian (the best one), Gibson's (huge and tastes like Ferrero), so getting this dry terrible chocolate cake at TCG was a HUGE disappointment.  Needless to say, we will not go back!",-0.709,0.797,0.091,0.112,0.48908941633079567

I asked to sample a wine and the bartender was happy to give me one. I was surprised I wasn't given or offered water. After about ten minutes I realized that and got the bartender's attention and he knew what I wanted without me saying it.  The bartender was training someone so when the usual dinner setup came, the trainee laid serviette very jaggedly and the fork was upside down - I knit-pick since it is the Capital Grille. I got the bone-in ribeye which was perfectly cooked and seasoned but I've had better cuts at restaurants like STK, Gibson's, and Carmichael's where the bone comes out of the middle part of the end and doesn't take up one side of the steak.

2016-02-10,5.0,"This is a long overdue review, but maybe it's because I always dream of this restaurant every time I crave good ambiance and food. As a Yelper, I'm a bit ashamed to say that I didn't take advantage of this year's past Restaurant Week. However, my fiancee did manage to snag reservations at The Capital Grille with everyone at her workplace raving about what a great deal it was.  We dressed fancy that night because in addition to Restaurant Week, it was also one year engagement anniversary. We were greeted by the friendly staff and I managed to tell them that we were celebrating an anniversary. Quite reflexively, the staff directed us to hang our coats. Afterwards, we were brought to our table and lo and behold, there were heart shaped confetti and a signed card by all the workers in the restaurant. What a great start! Literally a few minutes after being seated, we were being handed menus and a bread basket while getting our waters filled. Quite attentive. Our hostess was trying to sell a few special items on the Restaurant Week menu such as the unlisted Surf and Turf and a Steak Diane but we did our research ahead of time and preemptively decided on the 14 oz dry aged NY steak and the additional $10 of 18 oz dry aged steak with Kona rub (to compare). She did manage to have us try a different side and dessert.  My fiancee had a great view of the steaks being made and we enjoyed watching them prepare food as we ate through our blue cheese wedge salad with bacon (part of the three-course prix fixe menu for Restaurant Week). The only minor comment here is that I noticed that the table next to us were offered freshly ground black pepper and we weren't.  Not much longer, our delicious steaks were presented before us. To be honest though, I couldn't taste too much difference between the Kona rub and my the regular dry aged steak. My fiancee did say that the Kona rub was a bit sweeter with the caramelization and the regular steak had the distinctive, juicy steak flavor. Both were really delicious and the perfect medium rare. And we were really blown away by the buttery mashed potatoes! It was the perfect side to the steaks. If we hadn't gotten the green bean side, we would have probably said the same about the green beans as it was nicely crisp with a buttery finish. We finished everything. Dessert came with a coffee chocolate cake and a creme bruleed cheesecake. They went out of there way to put lit candles on our desserts so we could make a wish to celebrate. The coffee chocolate cake was slightly bitter to balance the sweetness. The cheesecake on the other hand was slightly sweeter with berries. In the middle of dessert, our hostess brought us complimentary champagne on the house to celebrate.  Overall, they were really great to us! Definitely come here to celebrate and prepare to be treated like royalty. Be sure to mention that you're celebrating a special occasion and wine and dine like kings and queens.",0.9992,0.761,0.224,0.015,0.49138959331267024

We reminded the waiter AGAIN.The flavor of the food we did have was very tasty, yet it is expected for the original price point of the restaurant. Nothing stood out. The mac and cheese came about 15 minutes later WITH NO LOBSTER. We were starving and realized neither one of us had had a piece of lobster until half way into the meal. When we stopped the server he looked as if he did not believe us, and said he would take it off of the bill. Another dish with lobster was never brought to us.  When our bill came, our drinks were not included. We asked our server to add them to the bill and he seemed very relieved we were honest and brought a revised check.

We arrived at 5pm during their slow hours but the manager proceeds to tell us that they need the table back at 6:30 and that should be enough time to eat. Note this is before we were escorted to our table. We then follow the host through the empty restaurant, past the bathroom, past the employee break room, and finally to a table all the way in the back where they clearly use as a storage room during off hours.  We looked past it since we planned this for a couple of days. After dinner we walked back to the front and saw the ambience that everyone else was experiencing. This was no where near the shameful poor experience we just had. I had better experiences at those run down restaurants where you are forced to eat at during a road trip . They seriously should reconsider just rejecting people before putting them in a storage room next to the brooms. How pathetic that this is compared to great steak houses like a Gibsons, Mastro's, or Gene & Georgetti. Capital Grille should invest in better hospitality training instead of those insignificant iPad drinks menus that no one over the age of 5yrs will be impressed with.

When we got there they told us he actually could have worn jeans and a t-shirt so just FYI for you lounge lords. They had a card on our table for him, some confetti and even brought us complementary champagne (kiddy cocktail for his 13yr old daughter). Everything on the menu sounded delicious and everything we got was really tasty.

I called the day before and told them it was his birthday and we were met at the door with Happy Birthdays from everyone we encountered. They seated us in a huge booth adorned with balloon confetti and a happy birthday card signed by all of the staff members. The service was prompt and top notch--our waiter Aaron explained the menu options in detail and was attentive without being overbearing. The drinks were strong and the food--ABSOLUTELY delicious. I chose this place because of the reviews for the lamb chops (my bf's fave dish) and they held up to the reviews. Fantastic flavor. They were initially a little too rare for my BF's taste, and Aaron took them back and customized them to my bf's liking (and even had the foresight to bring an extra plate while we were waiting so my bf could eat the sides). We also ordered the salmon and the lobster mac n cheese, both delicious. At the end of the evening, Aaron brought us a happy birthday cheesecake and flourless chocolate cake AND sample-size glasses of Stoli vodka that had been soaked in a pineapple for 14 days (yes, 14 days). All in all, EVERY facet of this experience was A+. We agree it's our new favorite restaurant. Ask for Aaron!

2015-03-11,3.0,"For a chain restaurant, Capital does a decent job on steaks and service, but stay away from the extras.  $12 for a wedge salad will you get an 1/8th of a head of iceberg, covered in pre-made bulk dressing and a few out of season tomatoes.  The clam chowder was decent, as is a can of Progresso for a fraction of the price. We were upsold on the Kona coffee rub, which added a touch of flavor, but not the best value.  Meat quality was excellent, but the plates are pretty barren in terms of appearance. Desserts are generous in size, but run of the mill in selection.  Basic creme brulee/chocolate tortes/pies will do the trick, but as an ex-bakery cook, they are a bit lackluster. Service by far will bring me back here.  With just the right amount of humor and upselling skills, the service team knows what they're doing.   This is Chicago, though, and there are way too many better steakhouses to pay this one a second visit.",0.9231,0.833,0.112,0.055,0.4918498168498168

We are very well traveled though and we've ate at a lot of swanky places but The Capital Grill Chicago is now by far my favorite.  We both had the Lobster Crab Cakes which the chef personally paired perfectly an amazing white wine. I've had some pretty great crab cakes in the past but these things. I literally cut my bites in half and chewed extra slowly so I could savor these that much longer. They were absolutely amazing.  For our main course we both had an off menu item, the Filet Oscar topped with Crab and a side of Asparagus. This was yet another breath taker. The Filet was so tender it could be cut with a dull spoon and the flavor was perfect. The asparagus was nice a crisp. Everything was just amazing. Plain and simple. Our wait staff also outdid themselves again by selecting the perfect red wine to go with our steaks.  I wish I could say I tried their desert but they did not skimp on the portions at all so I was stuffed.

By the end of the evening I was blown away. Evan our waitperson was excellent. He was upbeat and knowledgeable about the food and the history of their location. My husband loves asking about the company and how long they have occupied their building.  I get a kick out of that. Evan was on point. Not once did we have to ask for refreshments or refills. This helped us to maximize our time and catch up without being interrupted. Now for the most important part of our evening. The food. My In-Laws both ordered from the Restaurant Week Menu. My son stuck with his usual chicken fingers and fries. My husband ordered  porter house . I tried something different this time. I tried the Gorgonzola Crusted Filet Mignon and creamed spinach. As soon as it was placed in front of me I thought I could not finish this large piece of meat. After eating my last bite I realized that the portion was large but so amazing I could not put my fork down.  Everyone at my table loved their food. After we were done we decided to walk around the Chicago area. The location of this property has many hotels to choose from, high end shopping, and a massive Apple Store. Once the evening was over we walked back to Capital Grill where the valet person could not have been nicer. Our car was parked a couple feet away. He walked us there, opened the door, and after we were all in the car he wished us a good evening. I liked the fact that instead of waiting for it to be retrieved from a lot it was so close.

The deal was too good to be missed. My first course was a bowl of hearty clam chowder with a slight hint of black pepper. It was rich and creamy, making it especially desirable for the cold weather. For the second course, I chose the 8 ounce filet mignon over the other two steak choices because I prefer a smaller portion with more natural flavors even as irresistible as shallot butter is. The steak was perfectly done at medium rare. My only complaint was the meat being slightly rough on the edges. And finally, I ended my meal with a sweet and classic creme brulee. It was standard and much more tolerable than my friend's sugar-stacked, flourless chocolate espresso cake.  A line was formed as we were leaving at 9pm.

The wedge salad was supposed to have blue cheese, tasted the flavor, but not any blue cheese. The salmon and green beans were solid, but lacked flavor. I'm glad I asked the server to cook mine throughly instead of just having it seared because raw with no flavor would have totally turned me off. Both desserts were delicious!  The servers are extremely attentive and very knowledgable. Being that I don't eat meat, and The Capital Grille is a steak house, I will not hold them to too high of a standard for the fish.

Chocolate espresso flourless cake - It came with a generous slice which was bit too much for one serving. It was more of a dark chocolate mousse.

Living so close to this Capital Grille I've been here numerous times and always enjoyed my dining experience (lunch and dinner). The service you receive here is always stellar and the food is always delicious and filling. My last time dining here was last night for a friend's birthday and again the dining experience was first rate. When we were seated at the table there was a birthday card waiting for him that was signed by all wait staff (nice touch). For starters we had a cup of French Onion Soup which was standard, but still good. Our selection for our entrees was the 14oz Top Sirloin with the Lobster Mac & Cheese and Oscar Style Roasted Potatoes. * The 14oz sirloin was cooked to perfection, flavorful and filling (I bought about 7oz home - ha dirty). * The Lobster Mac & Cheese was good, but I would have liked more lobster in the dish. * The Oscar Style Roasted Potatoes was something I haven't seen at our restaurants. The crab meat was plentiful and made me a happy man. The roasted potatoes were good, but the asparagus could have been cut a little thinner.  At the end of the meal our server Aaron M, who provided amazing service to us, brought out a celebration platter which consisted of a mini flourless chocolate espresso cake and mini cheesecake.

Knowing I was going to consume a 4000 calorie entree after sucking down 5 beers I decided to start out with a Caesar salad, not the most exciting choice, but it was delicious. For the main dish I went with the special Filet Mignon with a dry rub... It was prepared perfectly and one of the best tasting steaks I've ever eaten.  .. It complimented the sautéed spinach and mashed potatoes beautifully. For dessert I had the coconut custard pie and highly recommend it..

A couple of people were really dressed down on a Saturday night dinner. So if you want to come for a special occasion, maybe this is not the place because you'll feel out of place dressed up next to someone in their mom jeans and sneakers.  The service was spectacular, very knowledgable server. The wine list was extensive and the prices were reasonable. As we were not that hungry we decided to split the dry aged porterhouse 24oz ($48) and the lobster Mac n cheese ($16). The steak was delicious and properly cooked to a medium rare. The server brought out our steak on separate plates, nice gesture knowing we were sharing it. One with the bone in and the other with the fillet. The lobster Mac n cheese was cheesy goodness! Maybe the lobster is not exactly necessary as the cheese overpowers the lobster flavor but overall great dish! One of the best Mac n cheese I've had in the city. Also, really good bread basket to start off the meal.  Overall, a great dining experience. Not too loud either so you can enjoy a relatively quiet meal without shouting at each other.

I had the wine tasting course. Ok, it was ""just"" Kendall-Jackson wines, but man did they pick out the best nes! They were all delicious (even the white wines), and Charlet's descriptions were spot on. I know sommeliers that don't come near to her accuracy. But what I must emphasize the most, was their service. I went with my niece and her parents. She's only 17 months old, still at the stage where she cries unexpectedly, pretty loudly. But the only reaction we got from the workers was ""aaw, are you ok?"" and ""does she want a high chair?"" And when we asked if she could get just corn on the cob, which wasn't even listed on the menu, Charlet went and made sure my niece got it. Incredible!

All of us had a variety of steak as our mains.  Staff was great and delivered everyone's entree within 90 seconds... somewhat of a feat when serving 12 people all at once.  Everyone's steak was perfectly cooked to the particular diners requested temperature (this is a group of A-types... not the type to be bashful if something wasn't meeting expectations).  Everyone was happy.  Those that added something (Oscar style, au poivre etc) we're very happy with their addition.  I had the bone-in Delmonico (medium) and it was DELICIOUS!  Service was prompt, friendly, and attentive... but never overbearing.  Perfect balance of service when we needed it... and standing by when we didn't.  Most of us drank our desert and we lingered for a long time making merry after dinner.  Never once did anyone feel rushed like its time to go.  Another great experience at the Capital Grille and looking forward to going back.",0.9822,0.851,0.13,0.019,0.5825396825396826

Although we were downtown Chicago the decor of The Capital Grille reminded me of an exclusive country club or lodge. Large portraits of men followed us everywhere we went. We were ensconced in dark wood, high ceilings, and chandeliers. The space was expansive but had a row of booths for seclusion and possibly multiple rooms.  The servers were smartly dressed, professional, and friendly. We loved ours. He spoke with pride about the quality of the food and the generosity of their Restaurant Week menu. Indeed, we had plenty to choose from. My salad and M's soup were alright. I had the Capital Grille Cesar Salad with anchovies. I've never had anchovies on a Cesar Salad before and it was a welcome experience but not one that I would care to repeat. Anchovies or not, there's only so much anyone can do with a Cesar Salad. We both got steaks - two different cuts and preparations. I wish I could remember what they were called because they were both fabulous. Mine were two juicy medallions that were synonymous with goodness. I recommend discussing the steaks with your server because I am confident that he/she can steer you true. We also enjoyed our sides: green beans and mashed potatoes. These were delicious but we ended up taking them home and eating them later. Lastly we had dessert. We had a rich chocolate cake and cheesecake with seasonal berries. M preferred the cake and I loved the cheesecake. It was treated like creme brulee on top and worked perfectly with the fresh fruit. We were so excited about The Capital Grille that we looked up other locations on our phone and discussed planning vacations to the cities where they were. We were so giddy about it.

She also successfully navigated me through the rather extensive wine menu. The white wine she recommended was fantastic. * We ordered our son's dinner and a salad at the point we ordered wine...my son's dinner took 25 minutes and when it came it was not his dinner. It was another guests Filet refire they had already cut into (it was sliced). I'm not sure why the waiter put down the food before asking a single question. We looked at it oddly thinking there is no way this is the kid filet, cut into it and it was medium to medium rare. It sat for 10 minutes before our server came back and looked perplexed. She brought it to the front of the restaurant and came back 5 minutes later with the kids filet without the  truffle fries we ordered. The manager came with the truffle fries, apologized for the mix-up and said the truffle fries would be comped. At this point we had been seated about an hour and still hadn't ordered dinner.  * in between we had waited on drink refills for some length of time (it was a Saturday night and they were busy, so again no huge deal) * We ordered dinner: we got the Kona crusted steak and pepper steak, both medium. Plus mashed potatoes for the table and a tomato mozzarella salad appetizer.  * The appetizer came in a timely manner. It was phenomenal!! I've eaten caprese salad at a number of restaurants. This was the best I've ever had.  * The food took quite a while to come. I lost track...but when it did the order all came at once and the steaks were perfectly cooked. I was very surprised that one steak had tons of juices and was very flavorful (Kona crusted steak) the other had the sauce on the side at my request and was incredibly dry. I had three bites and packed the rest to-go and never ended up eating it.  * We waited a bit for the check, paid and left. Start to finish we were there 2h:35m.  Overall I feel the service may not be indicative of the restaurant (again, they were very nice and busy so I didn't want to complain) and maybe I just ordered the wrong type of steak. I'd like to try again to see if next time yields a better result, but am not certain I want to risk paying another $300 when I know Ruth's Chris is always consistently good.",0.9194,0.881,0.073,0.045,0.5032059314954053

I made reservations online and specified it was for a birthday. We were NOT disappointed! Valet is only $11.99 which is great when you consider that parking in that area of downtown is hard to find and the parking garages are very expensive. When my wife walked in, they greeted her by name. I don't know how they knew that! The place has extremely high ceilings, dark wood trim, soft colored walls, and of course bright white table cloths. The place has a little art deco feel to it which kind of gives it a throwback to 20's and 30's. When we got to the table there was a birthday card waiting for my wife signed by all of the staff that would be waiting on us. Our waiter was Rich Dornan - the guy is FABULOUS. He was very helpful and not pushy at all. Often, these types of restaurants can be a little stuffy. But, Rich was down to earth and had some great suggestions for our meal. The actual server was a young man by the name of Wilson. Our water glasses never got beneath three-quarters full! This staff is very highly trained it shows! We had the aged porterhouse steak. It was packed with flavor! The mashed potatoes were creamy and just melt in your mouth good. Perhaps, the steak at another place might have been just a little bit better - I don't know.

If you try to compare or juxtapose these fries with any other fries, you will be committing a Capital crime and will be summarily stripped of all badges and integrity forthwith. These fries are King.  + The Lemonade. This puckery-sweet drink could save an entire navy.

Absolutely top notch, minus the obnoxious staring waiter.  + The Damages. Sixteen bucks for a burger and fries. A burger at DMK is about 10 bucks and doesn't include fries, which are another three or four bucks, so you're just about right in line price wise relative to DMK and are getting a better burger. I suspect the same would be true in the case of the vaunted Kuma's.  Overall, Capital Grille is simply outstanding in all facets and reasonably priced for lunch.

I mean, it's the city of steakhouses, and a chain restaurant being a top option was a little surprising. However, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the experience. We were seated quickly, and it seemed that the staff was bending over backwards to help us.  I got the Delmonico, with a side of sautéed spinach. The steak was extremely tender and at just the right doneness, but I think it could have used a bit more salt. Still, the waitress suggested a very nice wine to go with it.

2013-07-17,4.0,"This place is at the top of its game. When it comes to a classic quality steakhouse, I haven't experienced better.  The interior is a high-ceilinged, stately gentleman's club, with a nice private booth in the back as well as a separate private dining room of the main as well. There is a formality to the place which is sort of what you would expect for the premium offerings. Our birthday group of 8 tried a number of things, and the standouts were the spicy calamari with peppers. The portions are really huge, certainly enough for 4 to share as an appetizer. We were unimpressed with the smoked salmon on toast points, however. The caesar salad was nearly perfect, classical and fresh in every way with a light lemon, anchovy dressing and shaved parmesan.  The Delmonico steak is ginormous and has a nice meaty chew compared to the perfectly buttery filet mignon.  I ordered a parmesan crusted sole with a side of crab and avocado salad. The portion really serves two, but I enjoyed nearly every bit of this perfectly crispy and delicate sole.  The simple side salad with the jumbo lumps of premium crab was heaven. This entree is a winner.  Sides are to die for, and you have to try creamed spinach which also plentily serves four or more. I have never tasted spinach as rich and delicious as this. The flourless chocolate espresso cake was out of this world. We had one comped because of the birthday and my nephew liked it so much, he ordered another just for himself. Service is professional and seamless, but not too chummy, which I appreciated.   The hamburger at lunch may also be a best kept secret.

On my first visit, we started with the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio, which was succulent, well made and perfectly spiced. For the main course, we had the Bone-in Kona and the lamb chops. The steak was immaculate, the shallot butter on top along with the rub made it sublime. Each bite was intricately layered, and had a balanced taste. This was one of the best steaks I've had, good enough to have me dreaming about it nights after. The lamb chops were good too, but were completely overshadowed by the steak. We were completely satiated, and failed to make it to the dessert course. Second time around, I had the Calamari to begin (adequate, it's hard to get Calamari just right) and the Delmonico steak for main course. I was loath to stray away from the Kona due to my previous experience, but my server strongly suggested that I try the Delmonico. And boy, was he right! The Delmonico is definitely different from the Kona, but is a worthy companion on the menu. We had the Crème Brûlée for dessert, and it was fantastic. I would recommend keeping room for dessert even with the awesome steaks in the main course, you won't be disappointed. Overall, the service was great both times. Our servers were attentive and helpful, but not over-bearing. They had accurate descriptions and good pairing suggestions for the menu items.

2013-06-26,5.0,"Restaurant Review Great weekday lunch special! For an early birthday meal, I took my wife for lunch at this wonderful restaurant that serves her favorite chocolate hazelnut cake that cost 10 dollars a slice. This is a classy restaurant which I have been to in the past for pharma dinner. I was surprised that for 16 dollars you get quite a exquisite lunch. You start with a starter which is either clam chowder (large amount of clams) or a small salad. The entree choices included sirloin steak salad (maybe 6 oz) of aged steak cooked to perfection with some greens/beans. My wife chose the lobster roll which is quite a treat. The roll itself was a long skinny brioche or pretzel roll with large helpings of lobster. There was also a scallops dish which the waiter did not recommend... Finally the third option is the side. We went with the truffle fries with parmesean. Hands down the best fries ever. The meal also comes with a nice bread basket. Server was attentive and super nice. He did accidentally give us the wrong dessert which we ordered to go, a chocolate tart instead of the hazelnut cake so I had to walk back and exchange it. All and all, this is a super nice business for lunch or a nice date! Remember to dress business casual as the restaurant is quite nice, but some people still go to lunch wearing shorts which looks tacky.

When I took the rest home, I realized the entire middle of the steak was raw. Not sure rare....raw.  I get that medium rare has a slight raw center...but this was a bit too much, too raw.  I definitely had to cook the leftover some more but it was still one of the best steaks I've ever had.   I don't have too much more to add besides amazing beef carpaccio, the chocolate cake is fantastic but far too rich to finish after such a heavy meal.   Given the raw steak, I think it says a lot about the place that I'd still give it 4 stars.",0.9846,0.812,0.188,0.0,0.5912314023425135

I was very excited about dining there but my wife and I felt a bit disappointed as we left. I must digress and highlight the fact that we were not dressed as well as we would have hoped. Our daughter is at Lurie Children's Hospital and we stayed a little too long to allow time for a costume change. Notwithstanding the aforementioned statement, my wife was in a nice skirt and blouse and I was wearing a button-down and nice navy shorts (I know shorts). Once we arrived, we gave the host our name, which the reservation was under and we were promptly directed to our table. We found ourselves in the upper deck of the restaurant, the back section if you will. We were sat with the ""families"" screaming kids and blaring iPods to pacify the children, understandable but not for this place. We should have been sat somewhere else. Then the next thing that grabbed our attention was this other party of two, which I cannot figure out the relationship of these two but that man paid. The woman never took her eyes off her phone long enough to enjoy a bite, while the ""gentlemen"" accompanying her continued to drink from a large form McDonald's sweet tea cup. This was noticed by the staff but they seemed to not care. I do not want to attend a restaurant that I will have to pay $275 with tip for two and experience these types of things. That is the whole reason to pay these prices is for the experience and class. Not drive thru beverages and arcade-like atmosphere.  The food: We ordered the seafood platter for our appetizer and the filet and lobster for our entrée. Despite having to send the lobster tail back from the appetizer, everything was delicious.

The bf ordered the 22 oz Delmonico steak and I ordered a 2 lb lobster.  Both were fantastic - the steak was cooked just right at medium and the lobster was cracked open accompanied by warm butter.  This doesn't seem like the place where you go to town with a cracker and bib which was fine because I was stuffed given the size of the lobster.  We were so full, especially after starting with a Caprese salad.  For dessert they gave us a gluten free chocolate cake with blackberries - not too heavy and with the berries tasted awesome.  The Stoli Dole was a highlight - they steep a pineapple in Stoli for 2 weeks and serve straight.   I'm pretty sure I'd been here a few years before on a client lunch - on the outside there's definitely a corporate look and feel which also carries to the inside with the dark wood and heavy meats.  There are a lot of steakhouses in Chicago and as I've noted, I'm not a meat eater so I really look at the non-meat options.  The lobster was awesome and hit the spot.  We had a great time!",0.9953,0.79,0.203,0.007,0.571931216931217

Second, my fiancee and I ordered steaks off the menu.  We asked Anter if they still offered them and he said yes and placed the order.  A few minutes later, he proceeded to come back to our table and tell us that he added those particular types of steaks to our customer profiles so that in the future they will be suggested by the waitstaff when they first take our order.  A little while later during dinner when he comes back to check in on us, he offers to have our picture taken at the table with both a camera from the Capital Grille and my phone camera.  He took his time and took multiple pictures for us.  Later her returned with a printed picture free of charge.  Finally after we ordered dessert, he brought it over and told us it was on the house beause of my fiancees birthday.  These desserts are pretty large in size and not cheap.  When we finished paying the bill I shook Anter's hand and thanked him for one of the best dining experiences that I ever had.  I work in a service industry and always appreciate good service.  Anter definitely went above and beyond.  Next time I go to this restaurant, I will ask specifically for him.   Oh yeah, and to top it off, everything was delicious.  Try the French onion soup and ask for a cajun ribeye ""the Cowboy"" off the menu.",0.9928,0.879,0.118,0.003,0.32333914053426244

Now for my review: we visited ""The Capital Grille"" for lunch recently. The great service begins at the door where you are greeted with a smile. The food is outstanding and one of the best lunch deals in the Mag Mile. The one-page lunch menu has a lot to offer. The warm delicious bread served with the meal is awesome and that description comes from someone who is not bread crazy. There's a prix fixe option that offers three main dishes. This week I chose their special, a salad with a 10 ounce sirloin cooked and sliced beautifully on top, clam chowder soup (generous portions of clams) and Parmesan truffle fries. It was all terrific. If you're from out of town and have limited access to this restaurant, then I recommend you try their French onion soup which is a bit pricey but eye-popping good. They offer lobster bisque, however I have not tried it yet. In their crab and lobster burger you will find chunks of lobster. Their fried calamari is delicious!

Came here for dinner on a Friday night, and while we did end up waiting at the bar for a table much longer than the time we were quoted, it gave me a chance to discover their signature cocktail: The Stoli Dole. It's probably one of the best cocktails I've ever had: they allow Stoli Vodka to infuse with pineapple over 2.5 weeks and the result is a delicious drink that I would definitely go back for.  I've seen a lot of raving about the lobster mac & cheese, but I have to say it was just ok. It was much more mac & cheese than it was lobster. As for the steaks: I had the Delmonico, and while it was very good, it was a bit on the sweet side for me because of the rub. I would probably try something different next time.

I had the steak tenderloins with lobster tail and it was flavorful, juicy and cooked to perfection.  It was on the smaller side but still enough that I had leftovers.  Hubby had porterhouse steak (huge) and also thought it was delicious and he's a real big steakhouse critic.  We also shared the staple lobster mac n' cheese.  Large portion with nice thick chunks of lobster.  For dessert, they brought us creme brûlée AND flourless chocolate cake...all on the house.  Once again, large portions and perfection.  I would highly recommend this place!",0.9956,0.762,0.228,0.01,0.5143103448275861

I'm not a huge fan of the normal Chicago ""staple"" steakhouses (don't get me wrong, I'll go to them...but I like other steakhouses more). The Capital Grille has jumped into a top spot when it comes to Chicago steakhouses since my visit there this past Friday. From the minute you walk in, to the minute you leave, they take good care of you.  Dave P was our server and he was great. From the recommendations, to the actual service...he's really top notch.  Pre-dinner, I loathe the damn bread basket that's on the table. 99.5% of the time, i'm able to fight off my urge to eat the bread they bring to the table....not this time. 3 slices of pumpernickle later and I hate myself and I can't wait to workout. It's SO damn good!  For starters, I got the ceasar salad. It was delicious. It wasn't too full of dressing, the croutons were perfect, there's a shaved slice of parm for you to enjoy. I hear the clam chowder is also VERY delicious. ""One of the best I've had in Chicago"" was the reaction I got.  For my entree, I was talked out of my usual Filet Mingon and swayed towards a 14oz Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin with Shallot Butter. I could not have been happier with this recommendation. This steak is amazing. I highly recommend it. Sam's mashed potatoes accompianied my steak and again, delish!  For dessert, we had Classic Crème Brulée and Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake. If it wouldn't take hours at the gym to work this off, I'd eat either or both of those for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the next two weeks. If you're a chocolate lover, the cake is the way to go. I feel like I'm going to start drooling thinking about it.  For a cocktail, I had the Stoli Doli. Yeah, you heard me... Stoli Doli. It's pineapple vodka. I LOVE PINEAPPLES AND VODKA.

2012-12-01,4.0,"We ate here on recommendation of my father, a regular there.  The lobster bisque was ok, but the brandy kicked it up to a solid four.  Without, it was a bit too fishy (not like lobster, but fish).  The wedge salad, while overpriced, was good.  The quality and quantity of blue cheese made me feel not so bad about the price.  The cheese was very sharp (a good thing), but still very creamy.  The wife had the caprese salad and loved the variety of tomatoes.   Right up front our server told us of a ""one left"" bone in filet mignon they had cut extra, so we told him to reserve to right away.  It was a good thing we did, as he had to stop several other servers from telling about it.  I inquired of the steak au poivre or the porterhouse.  He recommended getting the porterhouse au poivre, which I did.  I ordered it my usual medium, but ended up looking, tasting, and feeling more like well done.  Plus the amount of peppercorns made any steak flavor COMPLETELY disappear.  To be fair, this was the first time I had ordered au poivre, and learned from my mistake.  Why one would do that to such a wonderful piece of meat, I don't know.  I pointed out the well done-ness of the steak, and he said it was due to it being a dry aged steak.  Again, first time for a dry aged.  I've had a 45 day wet aged before, and found it lacking.  He offered to get me another steak cooked rare or med-rare.  I ordered it med-rare, and had him leave the au poivre off.  This was what I was after.  Meat so tender, I was able to cut the fillet portion with my fork.  The flavor of dry aging, which is why it is so expensive, came through beautifully.   For sides, we ordered the mushrooms, fries, and creamed spinach.  The mushrooms are an absolute buy if you are a fungus head as we are.  The spinach was good, but not great.  It had an unusual flavor I enjoyed, but the wife didn't.  The fries are a bit of a mixed basket.  The truffle flavor definitely came through, and they almost had a creamy mouth-feel, despite being fried. The mix part is they also kind of reminded me of fried I've had cooked in dirty oil, for a tenth the price.   As for service, both our waiter and the bus-man were very attentive without being intrusive.  Water glasses were promptly refilled, as were the San Pellegrino glasses with the bottle being kept on ice.   The knocked star was for not mentioning the need to rarify my dry aged steak one notch.  Also, I was still charged for the au poivre after canceling it.  Also, everyone else in the room (6 tables) was given a free desert or two, while that wasn't offered to us.  It may have been the $20 of meat they trashed earlier, but I still felt a bit slighted.  Also, the mood spot lighting was like the Eye of God was looking at me.  It was the only one in the room that was bright white, versus light tan(?).  It was literally blinding me from the reflection off the silverware.  We did change to the next table over, and it was much better.  The server and manager both attempted to adjust it with no success, but they didn't seat anyone else there after our complaint.  As we were finishing, a party with several children was seated near by (thankfully they were as well behaved as my own) and the staff did accommodate their kid tastes.  I saw some regular Mac-n-cheese and chicken fingers go by.  They also brought the kids food out much before their main entrees arrived, which as a parent tired of eating cold food, I really appreciate.  I would not bring my kids here however, as a $200 dinner for just the adults is a bit more special than a family restaurant.",0.9971,0.809,0.142,0.05,0.5199066192023941

We had the filet and the kona sirloin and a side of green beans.  Green beans very tasty but perhaps over-buttered (like that's a possible thing!).  Both steaks cooked properly.

Head and shoulder better than Ruth Chris, Maestro, or Gibson's.  Food:  Calamari- the spicy peppers in here give this classic dish a great kick. It really is perfection.  Lobster and Crab Cakes- I dream about these delicious little cakes. Huge chunks of lobster stirred in with mouth watering crab and served with just the right amount of breading and basically 0 filler.  Perfect every single time.  Bone in Kona Crusted Sirloin with Shallot Butter- Drool Drool Drool. Literally the best steak I have ever eaten in my life. The crust is perfect. Every single time this steak has been cooked exactly like I like it (medium) all the way through. No well done edges, no raw centers. Perfection, each and every single time.  This is why I come back. I can't even bring myself to try anything else on the menu. Although my fiance states that his Delmonica is pretty good too.  Creme Brulee- again you can't make bad creme brulee but this is truly perfection in creamy custard form.  Chocolate Flourless Cake- also delicious ( i'm still more partial to the creme brulee though)  The only thing I've ever eaten here that I would not reccommend is the the Clam Chowder @ $10 for a tiny bowl. It was just wasn't memorable or tasty enough to justify the price.  Service:  The service every time we have been here has been immaculate. We are laid back, young, casual kind of people and even when we've walked in at our most casual we have not been pushed into a dark corner or treated condescendingly.

2012-05-07,5.0,"It was my last night in Chicago and I wanted a steak. I asked around and was told to go to the Capital Grille. I was seated at a table in the back, facing the kitchen. It was amazing to watch the food fly out of there with the care and precision that I would expect from a great restaurant (yes, I've watched many Kitchen Nightmares episodes and I don't think Gordon Ramsey would find anything wrong with this place!). My waiter, Paul, was superb! If you go to this restaurant, ask to sit in his section, you won't be sorry. He brought me a sampler of the house cocktail, which was some vodka thing that tasted very yummy. He was knowledgeable of the entire menu, wine list, etc. All I had to tell him was what I liked and he immediately gave me recommendations for wine and food which were spot on. I went for a bottle of the syrah because they were out of the Malbec, which was my first choice. Dinner consisted of the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing (can't say no to anything with bacon), the truffle fries, side of mushrooms, and the procini Delmonico drizzled with the aged Balsamic. I usually like my steak rare, but Paul explained that with this cut of meat, a medium or medium rare would enhance the flavor of the steak. Once again, I listened and boy was I glad I did! The meal was to die for! At the end of the meal, I was stuffed with a half bottle of wine to go and I didn't want to take up his table, so Paul found me a spot at the bar to watch the hockey game and finish my wine.  Stacy, the manager, was extremely helpful and welcoming and I saw her come back to the kitchen area to check on the staff and the food from time to time, very impressive.  Carlos, the bus boy was extremely friendly and certainly brought a huge smile to my face.  Honestly, this was a perfect night. The service here was top notch, my needs were anticipated and met before I knew I needed anything. This is going to be one of my go-to restaurants every time I am back in town. Now time to try the Capital Grille in LA and see if it compares... the bar has been set pretty high tho!",0.9949,0.814,0.158,0.027,0.6089145658263305

2012-05-06,4.0,"I had a great experience at this location.  I'd never been to a Capital Grille before even though I have passed them both in the city and out in the suburbs.  I suppose I'd never gone because I'm always a little skeptical of chains when we have so many good independent steakhouses in Chicago.  That kind of thinking was a big mistake.  When I went there with my dad it was both of our first visits so we weren't quite sure what to expect though I had heard good things.   This is a little bit on the expensive size but it's comparable to similar steakhouses and the service matches the price.  The service was great.  We were seated right away and our waitress was friendly and attentive.  She made some good recommendations on food and it was all a hit.  We started out with the fried calamari which was a great adaptation of a classic.  It had a great kick to it because of the peppers sprinkled throughout the platter.  We followed that up with soup.  My dad had the clam chowder and said it was pretty good; not necessarily anything special but good.  I had the French Onion soup which was delicious, even though I'd basically say any decent Onion soup with great Gruyere on top is a-ok with me.   For my main course I had the Delmonico steak with a mushroom sauce on top.  It was delicious.  The steak was cooked at a perfect medium rare and the sauce was a wonderful compliment.  I'm a huge fan of mushrooms and these were particularly well cooked and seasoned.  We shared the lobster mac and cheese which had a great taste and was generous with the lobster meat.  I also had grilled asparagus which was nicely seasoned with sea salt and olive oil cooked to perfection.   To sum up, it's a great steak place and this location has wonderful service as one would expect at a more upscale restaurant.",0.999,0.678,0.302,0.019,0.6196601104209799

2012-03-23,5.0,"Steakhouses are serious business in Chicago (and throughout the Midwest for that matter).   I've dined at other 'top-tier' steakhouses in Chicago,  St. Louis, NYC,  Dayton, Cleveland, Cincy and Columbus.  They know beef in this part of our country.  What we get in terms of a steak Cali is a joke compared to what  people are used to here.  My favorite out of all of them is possibly an unconventional choice  even for most Chicagoans:  the Capital Grille.  CG  has lots of competition:  Gene & Georgetti,  Gibsons, Wildfire,  Joe's,   churrascarias and celeb chef steakhouses .   I know CG  is a chain, but I like...correction love this restaurant for steak and for its unparalleled service.   It's clear to me now, service especially at a steakhouse is critical to one's happines :))   Try it once and I'd love to hear what you think.   The service environment here is un-f*&^ingbelievable!  It's attentive and I feel waiters are keeping an eye on you from ""the back of their heads"". For me, no other steak establishment in Chicago rivals Capital Grille's  standards for service and quality of meats.  In fact the meats here, taste just as good (and when flavored with porcini, waaaaay better)  and well prepared as any of the somewhat tired standards in this town.  I love the Porcini rubbed Delmonico, Dry-Aged Porterhouse here. It sounds contorted but it's not.  The 12 yr old balsamic drizzle (reduction)  that comes with it is just right, if it were a leap older,  it would be paired with dessert.  I love this steak with a delectable Amarone or a fine azz Malbec.  CG does this dish right to put it simply.    I am a firm believer in a traditional unadorned grilled  steak but here I make the exception.  If you prefer an undressed steak, you can ask for that at CG also.  I have ordered and enjoyed a grilled filet and the steak was grilled to my liking with charred edges the way it's grilled at Gibsons and some favorite steakhouses in St. Louis and Cincy.   Outside of Argentine/ Brazilian beef, midwest beef surely comes second when it comes to flavor and CG Chicago tops this list for me.   Ya ya, there's Wagyu and Kobe but those to me are on a different plane altogether and will not compare them here.   Finally, the sides ooooh the sidez.    They're very good but who has room when you have the best steak and an amazing wine to go with it.   I just like some asparagus or a plain salad after my steak and that's just how I roll.   Service-wise, the CG in Chicago,  has shared with me the most attentive focus compared to most steakhouses I have visited. I've visited other CG locations: in LA, Ohare and in Jacksonville.  All  are ok, good, but is just not the same, the politeness and service levels are there, but not the same.  Every single visit at the dtown Chicago location was consistent and superb.  On top of that,  I'm not on the receiving end of stodgy attitude from a Peter Luger/ Gibsons  waiter  (that well-worn steakhouse staff attitude that bores me to no end).  I'm paying you good money, treat me well g-DAMMIT!!   Finally,  the best 'user experience' at a restaurant to me is when your senses and palate are heightened from the well prepared food, how the service delivery feeds and nurtures that high and you are smiling an hour after you've left the restaurant.    Yeah that feeling....when you just had soul food!   Food is not theatre here, nor is it cerebral.  It's about feeding the soul. Tonite is my 11th time here.   I notice, CG Chicago and thank you.     Visits: 10+",0.9991,0.778,0.199,0.023,0.5566681363903587

2012-01-03,4.0,"I came here on a Tuesday night with 6 friends.  My party came late, so I ended up waiting for them up front. The hosts were nice, but they gave me a strange look initially because I walked in with a backpack. A plaque in the waiting area advertised a gift card special that the restaurant was doing (A purchase of $500 or more meant that we could get 10% extra) Needless to say, we ended up buying $500 worth of gift cards and ended up with $50 extra. They will also be sending me a set of steak knives in the mail as part of the deal. The server Chrissie was very nice and knowledgeable. I started out with the lobster and crab cakes. They came with a side of corn, which I thought was pretty nifty. After the appetizer the server came and took our order. I got the lobster bisque, the porterhouse Oscar style, a 2 lb lobster, mushrooms and asparagus. The soup took a while to come and when it did it was lukewarm, but still good. The highlight of the meal was the steak. Easily the best porterhouse I have ever had, cooked perfectly and the the Oscar style was a nice touch. The lobster was pretty good, but I didn't realize how much I ordered so I couldn't eat much of it. The asparagus came with a hollandaise sauce and was simply incredible. Next up we ended up getting some dessert. I split the creme brulee with one of my colleagues, nothing too great, but not bad either. I had a few small complaints, mostly that the service was pretty slow (took over two hours for the whole meal). I understand that larger parties take a longer time, that the server had other tables and the preparation of the dinner takes longer as well, but it just seemed too slow. My other qualm was the bathroom, I went to the mens room and the stall on the left had a toilet that was broken. I ended up having to take the plunger from underneath the sink to get the water to flush. I guess I just expected a nicer bathroom (the lock to my stall was also broken.) I had high expectations for this place and I really like it. Our server was very nice, but the service was a little too slow for me ( I don't like sitting in a chair for too long). I would definitely come back here because of the steaks) I took off half a star because of how long it took and half a star for the bathroom fiasco. I was pretty happy with the gift card special that they offered, but they let us know that the host made a mistake and that we weren't supposed to be allowed to use the gift cards on the same day (which is more than fair). 4/5",0.9983,0.737,0.214,0.048,0.49458228905597307

From reservations to valet to host stand to servers to bartenders to managers, I think you get the point. The food...is good to really good and sometimes great. The side dishes seem to be an afterthought as they have been overcook or bland. The steaks themselves are very good quality but sometimes are inconsistent when it comes to thickness. Why does this matter you ask? More often than not, if the steak is thinner than normal, it will come out overcooked and this has happened to me on two separate occasions. Both times the situation was rectified and quickly. The seafood is fresh and very good. Desserts are just OK, I have never had one that made me think...wow...The prices are in line with other steakhouses, the wine price points seem a little higher for what you get.

I would like to see more chances taken but some were taken so OK. bread for table: small, nothing special at all. in short, boring. for me that is also not a quibble more in the realm of a fail. in short lunch plate is solid but all the quibbles add up to a beef and I cant just give thumbs up to every 'nice' place if the attention to detail does not make it special.

It was a pretty substantial portion but I managed to eat the whole darn thing in one sitting.  Tried the parmesan truffle fries but they were a bit of a let-down, a little dry and not as much flavor as I expected.  I've had better elsewhere.  Should have stuck to my old, reliable lobster mac & cheese. Service was great and the meat came out cooked just as we had requested and expected.  The intended atmosphere here leans more towards dressy/fancy, but since they primarily service the tourist crowd, you won't be turned away or treated poorly if you show up a bit dressed-down.  However a nice collared shirt and/or blazer will help you fit in a bit better with the rest of the dining room.",0.9809,0.828,0.152,0.02,0.5158730158730159

Had large pieces of lobster in it. Very flavorful. They gave us a bowl of bread with soft butter. I asked a server for more onion bread, because it was so good. The server quickly gave me a large basket of onion bread without any attitude. That was really nice to see. They gave us 2 little crackers w/ complimentary lobster spread. It was a nice touch. Filet mignon with cipollini onions and wild mushrooms, medium rare- great flavor. perfect medium rare. Would order again 1/2 order of Mashed potatoes- large serving for 2 pple. We took the rest home. BF ordered Porcini rubbed delmonico with 12 yr aged balsamic- had good flavoring. had ordered it medium rare, but a large portion of it came out well done. My BF didn't say anything because he didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for another steak. He also didn't say anything to me until the end of the dinner because, I think he was just trying to have a nice quiet dinner with me.

Apologized and said, I can see the steak wasn't cooked right, you should have told me earlier, I would have gotten you another one.

We said it's ok, we ate 1/2 of it, it's fine. He ended up taking it off the bill and gave us a complimentary chocolate cake as a dessert. We made sure to leave a nice tip. Great service.

I don't know if it's because it was one of my first dates with my husband, the excellent food or even better service, but there's something about this place that has never been topped by any other location. I think what definitely stands out is the service. The entire staff from hostess to manager is the epitome of concierge-service. You're not rushed through your meal; you feel like you're catered to and take care of; and the knowledgeable waitstaff can not only guide you through a wonderful meal but recommend the perfect wine pairings to make each bite even more delectable. It's a steakhouse, so definitely eat the steak. It's fresh and seasoned and cooked to perfection. The filet mignon (my preferred cut) literally melts in your mouth and is so tender that you want to cry. And the parmesan truffle fries are to-die-for. But the best of all? The flour-less chocolate espresso cake. And coming from this non-chocolate lover (and truth be told, I don't even really like dessert), that's a big endorsement. On one occasion we had made a reservation for a pre-theater dinner and I let our waiter know that we needed to leave at a specific time to make the curtain. He was amazing and got everything out like clockwork without making it feel rushed or harried. When we ordered dessert, it took a little longer than expected; and while we weren't really paying attention to the time, our wonderful waiter was and came over to apologize profusely about the delay and let us know that he was on top of the kitchen to get it out. When the dessert came to the table, the manager brought it himself-- along with a second dessert that we hadn't ordered, apologized for the delay and comped BOTH desserts and our wine. Crazy!

And ordinarily I can't take advantage of all the wine TCG has to offer because of my budget, but hello, Generous Pour! For the summer you can sample several wines for just $25 and I (obviously) took full advantage. My clear favorites were the La Cana Albarino of Spain (white), Tarima Hill Monastrell of Spain (red), and Marquis de la Tour (sparkling white). And the pours were generous, indeed.  I got to try some new appetizers as well. The lamb lollipop was great, and I don't ordinarily eat lamb. But what really wowed me was the prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella, which literally melted in my mouth (I just found out they make their own mozzarella!). And as usual, my steak was done perfectly. I ordered the bone-in kona crusted dry aged sirloin with caramelized shallot butter (medium rare, to perfection), and I was practically licking my plate for any leftover shallot butter. Top it off with a side of the lobster mac n' cheese and I really had the perfect meal. Somehow my fork didn't make it onto the plate of spinach, so I can't attest to its deliciousness....

2011-07-19,5.0,"I came to Capital Grille for its WONDERFUL Generous Pour event back from its winter hiatus until Labor Day.  I cannot say enough great things about this, mainly because where else can you get a bottomless glass of a variety of (nice) wines for only $25 bucks?  I felt super fancy, trying all the wines, asking for more, then asking for more, then finally having to stop because it was only Monday.  Our waiter, Dan, was so well-educated about the wines and enthusiastically described each one in detail, as well as very attentive to what you liked and didn't like, just by looking at what  you drank and didn't drink.  The service felt very old fashioned and personal, the kind you don't really see too much of unless you are spending a ton of money, which you won't be if you go for the Generous Pour! I also sampled some of the Grille's fantastic food.  The star of the night was the mozzarella - made in-house, which is something I got used to growing up in New Jersey but have not seen too much of in the Midwest.  I love salty, flavorful mozzarella that is served ROOM TEMPERATURE, not practically frozen and flavorless as a lot of restaurants do.  Capital Grille's was perfection, fantastically paired with a tender piece of prosciutto (also hard to find because most restaurants shy away from the really fatty kind, which is the most tender and the way prosciutto is supposed to be).  I left feeling full and with a wonderfully pleasant buzz from my generously poured glasses of wine from Dan! Oh and the lobster mac 'n cheese.  I could go back and just eat that, with some wine, and be perfectly happy.",0.9952,0.774,0.196,0.03,0.5859670231729054
2011-07-16,4.0,"Since it was my first time at CG I was thrilled that they offered us a generous three course meal. We started with a single lollipop lamb chop, as well as appetizers of calamari, prosciutto wrapped mozzarella, and caprese salad. The mozzarella is made in house, which was quite delicious in the prosciutto. I loved the calamari served with hot Cherry Peppers. It was fried but not too over done, and the peppers added a nice kick (maybe too much depending on the person). The regular caprese was only ok compared to the other sides. My main course was the Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin with Shallot Butter (pictured at top). It was a very tasty piece of steak. I loved the blackened crust, which had Kona (i.e. coffee) in it and the shallot butter was an excellent addition. The portion size was plenty for me and if I had any self restraint I should not have finished my plate. In addition to the steak, there were sides of lobster mac 'n cheese and spinach passed around. I thought the mac was good, but Erica knows her mac and said it was one of the best she's had in a while. Something I've forgotten to mention were the wine pairings. For each course we had two different selections (as could you if you take part...). The highlight to start was the Marquis de la Tour, NV (sparkling wine), while my steak paired well with the delicious Chalk Hill Estate Cabernet Sauvignon, 2006. Each main had different pairings so the Tarima Hill Monastrell, 2009 was a top choice with Erica's fillet. Finally, the dessert course arrived with a delicious wine called The Portly Gentleman from Australia. It went perfectly with our flourless chocolate espresso cake and strawberries in vanilla ice cream. I'm not much for chocolate cakes but this was excellent and the ice cream and strawberries hit the spot. I was lucky our server was extremely generous in his offering of the ""port."" A real nice way to end the meal. I don't know many people that have been to The Capital Grille but count me as one of their fans. It was a generous (wink wink) event that allowed us to experience their high quality food as well as preview a fantastic deal for wine drinkers. I really enjoyed my steak (something I haven't said in a while), and thought our appetizers and sides were equally impressive (followed by a rich and satisfying dessert). Any meal is going to taste a little better when you don't have to see the bill, especially when good wine keeps flowing too. But I would recommend TCG and will keep it high on my list for a good steak dinner in the city.

2011-07-14,4.0,"I went to the Capital Grille for the first time in many years (the last time was Boston, maybe 2004 or 2005?) for their Summer ""Generous Pour"" event and was very happy that I did. For $25, Capital Grille is doing sort of a ""bottomless"" tasting of 9 different wines picked out by George Miliotes (Master Sommelier). Daniel (our waiter) was able to intelligently guide us through the various wines, glass by glass, and was happy to clear away a glass we didn't like, or freshen up a favorite. The wines were really unique, and covered a broad spectrum of tastes (light, full-bodied, international, domestic, etc.) but the standout favorite was the Tarmima Hills, a new, trendy Monastrell from Spain. It was fun learning about and tasting them all, though! As appetizers we had the pan friend calamari with hot cherry peppers (I'm picky about my calamari and spicy is not my thing so I could have done without this) and prosciutto wrapped mozzarella with vine ripe tomatoes (perfection). Apparently Capital Grille makes their own mozzarella, and it's to die for! As a main I ordered the bone-in Kona crusted dry age sirloin with shallot butter. The cut of meat was substantial, and it was prepared to my liking but the Kona rub (made from coffee) was so delicious I could have done without the typical 2 cups of steakhouse butter drenched on top. Also, I can never finish my steak but the leftovers make a nice steak salad the next day, just slightly less so with cold, fatty butter on top. This is probably my own doing, though, always order sauces on the side. As sides we got lobster mac and cheese (delicious!) and sauted spinach (impressively fresh).  For dessert we tried the flourless chocolate espresso cake (so-so) and the strawberries capital Grille, which was accompanied by vanilla bean ice cream (also house made). I'm never that blown away by steakhouse desserts, but I'm a sucker for handmade ice cream/gelato/lemon ice. All in all, Capital Grille seems to be a rare breed of steakhouse that's genuinely interested in attracting new clientele and keeping up with food/wine trends all the while not forsaking its bread and butter (in this case, steak). Plus, $25 for at least 9 generous pours is one of the best kept secrets in town!",0.9945,0.81,0.157,0.033,0.5938619146005508

2011-06-10,4.0,"Thanks to Nishan P for the heads-up on the $15 ""Plates"" lunch special, another one of my favorite Yelpers and I met here for lunch yesterday. That is simply too good a deal to pass up, in spite of the fact that I'd spend just as much in cab fare getting here. We arrived within minutes of each other and were ushered to a large booth. The decor is very clubby, with dark wood and ambient lighting; very much befitting a steakhouse. Our server greeted us and went over the specials but we both had our hearts set on the $15 lunch. We started with the mint lemonade, which was tangy, refreshing and mouth-puckering (I agree with Ashley C that there is little discernible mint flavor). The lemonade is served in a tall glass with a mini carafe of extra lemonade - very nice touch.  A bread basket was set on our table with delicious crusty rolls sprinkled with sesame and poppy seeds and served with cold butter adorned with crunchy fleur de sel and chopped parsley. Rolls devoured in record time. The lunch special consists of a choice of three things in each category: starters, main, and sides. Starters - clam chowder, roasted corn bisque, or a field green salad Mains - two mini tenderloin sandwiches, lobster roll, or annatto-rubbed mahi served with corn tortillas Sides - seasonal vegetable of the day, truffle fries, or a watermelon and tomato salad with feta I zeroed in immediately on the corn bisque and to no one's surprise, my East Coast dining partner chose the clam chowder. We both selected the lobster roll, and for sides, I went with the truffle fries and he went with the salad. The soups came out pretty quickly. The corn bisque was drizzled with a little chili oil and garnished with fresh chives and it looked very pretty. I love that they roasted the corn (the kernels had a nice char) instead of just tossing the corn in; it amped up the flavor. Since the temperature yesterday dropped considerably, it was the perfect way to warm up my belly. The lobstah rolls and sides arrived soon after. I was pleasantly surprised at the portion sizes of both the sides and sandwiches as I was expecting smaller versions. The lobster was rich and decadent, lightly dresses with mayo and crunchy celery and served on a split toasted bun. It was fantastic. As for the truffle fries, although I thought they could have been thinner, I would pretty much eat a sock if it were drizzled with truffle oil. The watermelon / tomato salad was tossed with a light vinaigrette and had crumbled feta. I love that they used heirloom tomatoes in the salad and the watermelon added a nice texture and contrast to the tomatoes. We were both too full to order any dessert but that didn't stop me from taking a gander at it for future visits. It had the usual steakhouse classics: cheesecake, creme brulee, flourless chocolate cake, and ice cream. Capital Grille definitely caters to Chicago's movers and shakers and captains of industry. In fact, we spied Christie Hefner circulating around the dining room on our visit. Needless to say, she didn't stop at our table. Since all of the choices on the ""Plates"" menu were great, I fully intend on coming back to try every combination, and although it's far too early in the morning for me to calculate just how many visits it will take me to try each one, I just know it's a lot. I better get started and plan my next visit. Who's with me?",0.9987,0.824,0.168,0.008,0.5840750915750916

I spent the morning feeling like I was still on a boat. I had lunch plans with a good friend and I wasn't about to be late for that. I kicked it in gear and hustled over to CG.  I have never been to CG and I wasn't ready for how nice it was. I kind of felt underdressed in jeans. With the roomy booths, dark wood interior and portraits of Chicago's business luminaries all around, I sensed that I wasn't worthy and maybe should start busing the tables. Regardless, we were greeted warmly by the hosts and well attended to by our server. CG has a great lunch special that we wanted to take advantage of. $15 for a mix and match app, entree and side. Everything on the list looked amazing and we knew we wouldn't be disappointed. We both started with some good and tart mint lemonade. The extra back up pour of lemonade nicely made up for the negligible mint flavor. We tore into the assortments in our bread basket while awaiting our food. I enjoyed the ""everything"" roll as I badly needed something in my belly. Our soups arrived quickly, corn bisque for the lady and I had the clam chowder. The bisque was a hit with Red (No, I mentioned the bisque) and I really liked the chowda. It was packed with clams and chunky veggies. We were off to a great start. Things only got better when our lobster rolls and sides arrived. Any time I can get lobster and not spend an arm and leg for it, I'm all over it. This was a damn good lobster roll. Not on the small size at all and also not too covered with mayo. Tons of lobster meat, well blended with a light touch of mayo and chopped celery, served on an awesome roll. I preferred this to the buttery versions I've had in the past. Our sides were also just right for sharing. Heirloom tomato and watermelon salad and truffle fries that scented the air. The freshness of the salad and the high quality of the heirlooms stood out to me. That's an excellent summer bite. The fries were sinfully good and I liked that they didn't bother muddying the waters with unnecessary condiments for them. It was all so good and a real steal for the price.  I don't know if lunch does this fantastic restaurant justice. It's a steakhouse after all.

The Capital Grille rarely fulfill any of the criteria which was surprising, mostly in a positive way. We were hanging somewhere downtown Chicago while a lady called to double confirm my reservation (which I made a while ago via Yelp). That was very thoughtful and definitely an efficient marketing strategy running a business, particularly during this special moment of the year. We lived rather close to the place so we walked over for dinner. Was slightly lost but prob was because the direction we walk towards. Found it eventually. No waiting, we got a good spot right away. Food wise, the portion was shockingly HUGE. I ordered a steak (don't quite remembered the name) and my mom got a tuna. The tuna was DELICIOUS, but the steak was okay, personally thought it was a bit over-done. Also, come'on, this is a fancy restaurant, they could've done a bit better job on the plate decor. Dessert, we ordered a chocolate hazelnut cake. I wasn't sure if it was for mother's day but, man, that was hell a lot of cake.

Another thought, the atmosphere was great, except when I was trying to use restroom, I noticed it was somewhat hard to move around since that place was really packed and seats were way too close to each others between tables.

IMHO, the steak was decent, but it certainly didn't rival Peter Luger's, CUT Las Vegas,  Maestro's Chicago or even Gilt Bar. The service was excellent, though. Our server was very warm and professional. He was better than another server. When my $48.00 24 oz Dry-Aged Porterhouse arrived well done on both sides (I had ordered medium rare-medium), I alerted the nearest server. Her reply was that I should cut the center???????? The logic of course is that the center is thickest so the temperature is perfect in the center. So, you want me to pay $48 for a 24 oz piece of meat despite the fact that the only part I will enjoy eating actually weighs 8 oz.  Hmmm.......No..................don't think so. SERVERS: When a patron gets a steak that is anything less than to their liking (especially for a $48 steak), just bring it back to the kitchen. MANAGEMENT: Don't put pressure on your servers to save money. It's not worth it. You lose more in the long run from decreased traffic.

2011-03-10,5.0,"In making the rounds of Chicago Steakhouses, this was always on the list but never a high priority.  My husband picked this one as his Restaurant Week choice and we went on a Friday night before going out to a concert.  I should have known better not to gorge on steak before going to stand in a crowded bar for a couple hours but the temptation was too great. The first thing I noticed was the level of hospitality and personal treatment this place obviously takes seriously.  They have a card with your name on it and everyone from the hostess to your server knows your names and calls you by them.  Interesting tactic. I started off with the pineapple infused vodka on a recommendation from a coworker and it was great.  I almost thought he just gave me pineapple juice it was so smooth. The RW menu was pretty straightforward.  Honestly I couldn't even tell you what the other entrees were because my eyes went straight to the 8 oz filet.  We both got the caesar salad but I think there was a house salad and clam chowder as options.  We both got the filet, they let the husband put blue cheese on his which was nice.  They split an order each of creamed spinach and mashed potatoes for us to share which was a perfect amount.  Seriously steakhouses need to get the side portions UNDER CONTROL. The steak was perfect and I almost stopped our server to ask how it was seasoned but I didn't because I'm a chicken.  It was delicious.  I ate it all.  And then all of the sides because they were great too. Then dessert came... I got creme brulee, my standby.  And husband got the flourless chocolate cake.  I ate all of mine and then half of his.  I couldn't stop, it was like fudge!  So rich and decadent.  YUM.

Let me start by saying I am a meat eater.  Grilling a good steak in the summertime or even the winter can't be beat!   The Capital Grille is our go to place when we get a craving.  We usually go with a traditional option, don't like to put sauces on a good piece of meat, and sometimes split them.  Most times we sit at the bar, which has great service although the service has also been good in the booths.   Usually start with some oysters, had the onion soup once and loved it as well.  Special vegetables can be fun and seem to be seasonal.   Like the spinach.  Not into the mashed potatoes - too creamy for us - but most people like them that way so we split a huge baked potatoe with the fixins instead.  Always try a couple of the special wines by the glass and they don't disappoint.  Usually do berries for dessert.  Service is always great and fun.

2011-03-03,5.0,"The actual food, I would give it s 4.5 star, but the service, makes this place a 5 star!  I am here on the last day of Restaurant week. Out of all the 3 other places that I went to (comparable to regular prices), I would have to say that the service here was amazing. I felt that at the other places, when the waiter/ waitress found out that I was planning to order the 3-course meal, they seemed to act different and more snobby. I mean, $33 for a meal is nice for restaurant week, but it's not super cheap. Add a drink, tax, and tip and you're looking at almost a $50 meal pp, so I don't understand why the service was so bad out of the other places.  I made the reservation online and requested a booth. When we arrived, they had a booth waiting for us. The waitress, Connie, did an awesome job. She was attentive and very friendly. She even asked us what other places we tried for restaurant week and did not seem to treat us any different because we were ordering from the $33 menu.  The FOOD:  1. Caesar salad- fresh and nice chunks of cheese. The amount of dressing was perfect. I really enjoyed this.  2. Clam chowder- this was just your typical clam chowder soup. Nothing out of the ordinary or over the top about this one, but it was good.  3. 10 oz kona steak- so juicy and tender. I had it cooked medium. It was charred to perfection! The sauce that came on the bottom was excellent.  4. Creme Brulee- EXCELLENT! I like creme brulee that have a more harder sugary top. When I order it from other places, it seems like they get skimpy on making the caramelized topping. Creme brulee is the best when you have to use your spoon to break the top. YUMM-O!  5. Flour-less Chocolate espresso cake- SOOO Good. I am a total chocolate person, so I enjoyed this also! It satisfied my chocolate fix. The cake was so rice and dense. It melted in your mouth like butter with every bite. Definitely something to try here.  6. The sides (mashed potatoes and creamed spinach). The portions are HUGE! The creamed spinach was creamy, but not too creamy. You could taste the spinach more so I didn't feel so guilty eating this. We finished the whole plate! Very good and not too greasy. The mashed potatoes was good too, but nothing special.  What can I say, the food and service here was excellent!",0.9983,0.728,0.222,0.05,0.6123094093406595
2011-03-02,5.0,"I was beyond excited to come here during restaurant week, as $33 for a 4-course meal here is a steal.  The other several times I've been here I was not responsible for the bill, thankfully, as it is pricey, but definitely worth every penny for a special occasion.   First of all, whoever thought the lobster mac n'cCheese is a genius, pure genius.  This is by far my favorite dish here, and it's only a side.  I realize that Capital Grille might not be the first restaurant to serve such a delicacy, but they definitely do it the best.  The lobster pieces are medium-sized and perfectly tender and the mac n' cheese is, well, you just need to try it; your tastebuds will thank you. The clam-chowder is great, but the lobster bisque is phenomonal (I am noticing a trend here).   Second of all, the steaks, oh my the steaks.  I had the Kona-crusted 8 oz filet this time (usually 10 oz although I thought it was the perfect size) and it was cooked to perfection (medium well for me).  Crispy kona crust outside and tender, juicy, succulent meat on the inside with a tiny bit of pink=perfect.  Probably one of the top 10 steaks I've had in my life.  I also remember the sirloin being equally delicious on a past visit. Finally, the desserts are beautifully displayed and taste even better than they look.  I was with a group of girlfriends so we just got one of each of the desserts available on the price-fix menu which included ceme brulee, flourless chocolate espresso cake, chocolate & vanilla ice cream, and cheesecake (given to us bc they were out of sherbet)  All were tasty but the cheesecake was by far the rest.  And I don't even like cheesecake!

So of course a journey to the Capitale Grille meant that I must get the filet mignon!  Both the fiancee and I got the mignon because we didn't want to start growling at each other when there wasn't enough of it go around.  The other appetizers on the restaurant week menu that we got were the clam chowder and cesar salad, both of which were good but nothing to howl about.  The filet sadly did not satisfy my inner carnivore. It wasn't very crispy on the outside and not as tender and tasty as the filets I've had at both Joe's Seafood and McCormick and Schmick (YES!  Both of which are seafood places!). And mine was more rare, rather than medium rare. Lastly we had the creme brulee and orange sherbert, both of which were pretty yummy!  I love it when they increase the surface area of the brulee by using a wide and shallow dish to maximize the caramelized sugar!   Although there is a slim chance that I'll be returning, it is important to note that both the ambiance and service were good.",0.9794,0.823,0.143,0.034,0.5810606060606059

I asked her to get me new lobster since I did not eat the undercooked lobster which had been sitting on my plate for 35 minutes waiting for her to return. Instead she took the lobster off of my plate and returned the same lobster to me in a dish saying it had been recooked!  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!

I'm so glad we went.  I'd only ever sat at the bar for drinks, so it was nice to venture on down to the dining area. Definitely doesn't feel like a chain, which was well appreciated. The atmosphere was really relaxing. Our service was top notch. We started with the tomato, mozzarella and basil salad (which for some reason was not listed as a caprese, but who cares?) We told our server that we were going to split it and it came out nicely arranged on 2 separate plates. We saw many going out to the dining room and it really looked like a very large portion for just one person.  I'm a recovering vegan/vegetarian, so I really don't know much about steak, much less enough to trust myself to pick a good choice (even when I ate meat, I was more a fowl than a cow person), so I asked my server if she would recommend the dry aged or the filet mignon. The sliced filet mignon with cipollini onions and wild mushrooms won out. Man, it was SOOOOO delicious! It really was a perfectly cooked, lean slice of yum. My husband ordered the porcini-encrusted Delmonico, which he enjoyed, but probably would've liked my filet better, as there was quite a bit of fat to trim off of his steak. For sides, and I appreciated that we were offered the option of ordering smaller sizes, I chose the seasonal squash with maple butter, which I could not stop eating and the haricots with roasted tomatoes.

Great fine dining experience.  For starters, they have absolutely the BEST fried calamari ever!  I'm not sure if the oil was infused by jalepeno peppers but the dish was crispy, spicy and finger licking good.  I had the Delmonico steak - very tender, seasoned and cooked to perfection.  And that thing was huge!  The lobster mac n cheese is also to die for - big lumps of lobster and great rich flavor.  We also shared a side of wild mushrooms....which was nothing but fantastic. I couldn't have asked for a better experience.  I will definitely return on my next trip to Chi-town!",0.9836,0.653,0.267,0.08,0.5463524130190797
2010-12-24,5.0,"Sister came to town to visit for Christmas, and I wanted to take her somewhere for steak. Unfortunately, the famous Chicago-only steakhouses were mostly fully booked when I called, so I decided to take a chance on Capital Grille given 1) close proximity to where I live, and 2) good reviews I had heard.   First thing to notice is the decorations at this place. A nice, classy set of decorations with oil paintings, wooden wine racks, and just an overall old-world feel to it. We arrived a few minutes early, but the Maitre'D sat us right away in a cute little booth. We were impressed by the wine list. Not wanting to get completely hammered, we asked for the list of wines by the glasses, which although noticeably shorter, was still ample for our purposes.  (Short interlude: bread came out during this time. I love bread, and their toasty, warm, buttery bread did not disappoint. I had to cover the bread to keep from looking at it, because I was having trouble controlling myself from taking a piece every time the bread sat in front of my eyes. Alas, such a strategy did not pan out. I just kept eating.) Our Waiter, David (whom you should ask for), came by, to tell us about what they had going on in the kitchen that night. I loved his attentiveness to details, and how he knew what they were cooking in the kitchen. Clearly they've spent time on this. What he proposed sounded amazing, but I just wanted steak. Of course, David told us about the Chef's specials, which got my sister interested. I personally just wanted a good steak, and he recommended the 24-oz porterhouse, which I got. We also had an order of sauteed spinach for added texture to our food...okay, to feel less guilty about our dinner. I ordered a glass of Spanish red, and my sister had a Riesling.  I love Spanish red wine, and this wine just went down smoooooth. So flavorful. I could not put it down. Like a party in your mouth.  Then our beautiful steaks (med rare) came out. I spent 30 seconds just taking in the aroma. It was wonderful. The sirloin, a little toughter than the tenderloin, was nevertheless juicy/flavorful. Oh, and the juices...the meat juices...'twas the nectar of the GODS!!  And then the silky, buttery tenderloin. I was left speechless. It reminded me why I loved meat so much. Animal proteins is good for the soul.  I had a couple bites of my sister's delmonico tenderloin. It was scrumptious. Definitely a different flavor. I can't comment on too much of this, as I did not have too much of it. But sis liked it.  Our waiter, who was attentive throughout although we never felt his presence when we didn't want to, came by with the desert menu. He was already 2/2 for recs, and so I asked him. He rec'd the Cheesecake. When I questioned him, he retorted: ""I haven't led you astray yet, have I?"" Shamed and without a good comeback, I acquiesced. We had an order to share, but they ended up cutting up the cheesecake in half onto two plates so we could each have our own plate. (I love this kind of attentiveness to detail...it shows they really try).  So let me tell you about this cheesecake. It was made with ricotta cheese as opposed to cream cheese, and it certainly gave it a much fluffier yet creamier texture than any cheesecake I have had. The crust was moist yet crunchy, and wow, the layer of cream-bruleed-styled burnt sugar on top added a crunchiness and smoky sweetness that I had never before had in my gustatory adventures. And of course, the berry sauce on top. Hmm hmm hmm. Sour & sweet. Yum. And some berries, which were fresh but not straight from the berry plants,  but who could blame them? We ate dinner in December of Chicago. 9.5/10 for this.  Our bill came, and it was very, very reasonable for a prime time steak house in Chicago. What was amazing was the manager came out with a holiday card (we had dinner on the 23rd of December) to wish us happy holidays, and for a holiday present a $$GIFT CARD$$ for my next meal!! I guess now I just have to find a nice lady-friend to take to Capital Grille.  In summary, I had a blast here. Easily one of the best meals I have had this year (on a list that includes sushi in Japan carved out, right in front of me, from a humongo tuna caught in the waters a few hrs prior). I would go back, in a heart beat, although if I keep going back, I'm not sure my heart would keep beating.  I just want to say, though, I was thoroughly impressed by the level of service here. I loved how everyone, from the manager to the Maitre'D to the waiter took the time to learn my name. It certainly showed respect. You know, respect is a two way street, and I truly respect this restaurant.",0.9995,0.752,0.208,0.039,0.5115614617940198

2010-11-27,5.0,"I've been to a handful of Capital Grilles, but never the D/T Chicago location. Surprisingly, after 2 something years, I enter this location last night. We were seated immediately, and at a decent table, which has always been a pet peeve of mine. Unfortunately, we were seated next to a young Asian couple who thought it'd be cool to bring their infant out for a fine dining experience. The server discretely asked my wife if we would like another table. Wifey nodded. I thought this was a cool move.  Being seated at a quieter table, our attentive server took our drink order. A self proclaimed Vodka snob, I inquired about the ""better"" Vodka options. Now, what irritates me more than anything is when I'm in a nice restaurant, and a server or bartender retorts, ""We have Grey Goose and Kettle One."" No, this server knew what the hell I was talking about and started spewing off good Vodkas. Yes, Hangar One, XO and Chopin are GOOD Vodkas- NOT Grey Goose!  My martini arrived and it was made to perfection. We ordered some salads for starters, and they were quite tasty. Both wifey and I had the filets (med. rare) for our entrees, and a side of the lobster mac-n-cheese. My only complaint (which really is not a complaint) is that the lobster mac didn't have hardly any lobster. The first time I dined at a Capital Grille in Jacksonville, Florida, the lobster mac was loaded with goodness. But, I was dining with the proprietor, so this maaayyybeee had something to do with it...  Nevertheless, the service was astoundingly good. After slurping down my martini, Paul, our server asked if I wanted a glass of wine with my steak. Well, yes indeed. I inquired if there was anything by the glass besides what was listed on the menu, and he strongly recommended a Cabernet, ZD. What really surprised me was that he offered a free taste. I was hesitant, thinking it at $20 a glass it would suck. No, it did not. It was really f'n good, and he brought out a generous pour in addition to the free taste. A bloody filet, paired with a ""Fat Cab"" is always a wise move. VERY GOOD RECOMMENDATION!   Competitive pricing for a 5-star establishment. In addition, great service and very good steaks.

We were the first reservations & arrived early, so we took a spot at the bar.  The hostess was warm and friendly as she explained that it'd be a few minutes for our table. Colin, the bartender, fixed us up w/ two Stoli Doli's & great conversation.  At dinner, we ordered the carpaccio & half-doz oysters for apps, Filet Oscar & that evening's steak special for entrees & truffle fries & lobster mac for sides. For 2 apps, 2 entrees, 2 sides & 7(!) martinis, the bill came to $237 - a good value we thought for a romantic & indulgent evening out.  We were comped a slice of flourless espresso-choc cake and a night cap round of martinis when we returned to the restaurant after a show. Another nice touch was the Happy Anniversary card on our table signed by the staff when we initially sat. A champagne bucket had been set out by our table & we thought we might get a bottle of bubbly on the house as well, but no such luck.  Our server Dan, and especially our busser Teddy, were super-friendly and doting. We felt like regulars, though we'd never been. All portions were hearty and: tender, crunchy, creamy, rich, or savory where warranted, BUT ... the ""truffle"" in the truffle fries seemed undetectable & the lobster mac was so piping when it first arrived that there was a little oiliness to it, like it was so hot it separated. The carpaccio was accompanied with a vinaigrette-dressed pile of arugula and shaved parm. It was a nice starter. The oysters arrived with ramekins of cocktail sauce, horseradish & mignonette sauce. They were very fresh tasting for sure. My Filet Oscar was cooked as requested, but I did need additional Bearnaise sauce, it was a bit scant on the plate. The lumps of crab - and lobster in the mac - were plentiful and large. The hubby's steak special looked like a porterhouse, but we can't remember what is was now - hello, Stoli Doli's! In any case, he enjoyed it thoroughly and it was also cooked to perfection. There were earthy elements (porcinis maybe?) and a hint of acidity (balsamic?) to the au jus & seared outside. I thought it was a tad salty, but the hubby may've salted it beforehand.    All in all it was a great experience and well worth another special occasion visit!

Sure Capital Grill is a chain with over 40 locations in the U.S., including Vegas and ones that recently opened in Beverly Center and Costa Mesa, but the steaks here are so surprising among the best, if not the best steak I've ever had in my life, chain or no chain!  We arrived at our reservation time and were promptly seated in a venue filled with borderline stodgy dark wood panels and rich paintings. While this motif did not appeal to my preferred design sensibilities, the ambiance was very welcoming.   The two of us ordered and shared the 22 oz porcini rubbed Delmonico with 12 year aged balsamic ($45) and a 14 oz bone-in Kona crusted dry aged sirloin with carmelized shallot butter ($43), since just about every Yelper wrote about those two steaks. The food came out all at once about 20 minutes after we ordered. Good thing we followed the suggestions since those steaks were soooooooooooo phenomenally tender, succulent, flavorful and all around incredibly delicious! I was blown away by the excellent quality of the meats and how the steaks were both cooked to perfection! The hearty portions were of unparalled flavor from the very first to the very last bite. Each bite was met with a noticeable yet subtle ground Kona-coffee notes that gave the steak a very luxurious robust overall flavor as it was accompanied by the shallot butter flavor which was wonderfully infused into the entire steak. Likewise, I was expecting a distinct porcini coating on the rubbed Delmonico but the mushroom and the 12 year aged balsamic flavors were seamlessly blended in.  I had such a great time alternating between bites of the Kona crusted sirloin and the porcini rubbed Delmonico that I was surprised at how we both inhaled those steaks in about 30 minutes, along with the sautéed spinach ($9) which provided a nice contrasting texture and the famous lobster mac 'n' cheese ($15) made with a deliciously rich and complex buttermilk flavored cheese with a few large chunks of lobster! I'm normally not a big mac 'n' cheese person but this side was to die for and served as a wonderful compliment to the meal. Unfortunately, we didn't have enough room for any dessert but this meal made my belly very very happy.

If you can shake that stereotype, CG is one of the best places in the city to go with clients, a night on the town with the guys or a special date. Their service is top notch and really makes you feel comfortable whatever the occasion or crowd your with.  The decor is over the top, in a good way. It has the feel of a grand ballroom, with huge wine displays and high ceilings. The only negative to the layout is the bar is small/cramped and in the flow of traffic. Then again you're not coming here for the bar.  The food is unbelievable, I've never had a bad meal in the dozens of times I've been here. Steaks are always perfectly cooked and portions are always huge. My go to is the kona rubbed sirloin, which I was strong armed by a waiter to order a few months back (if you don't like it, I'll give you your money back was his claim). It has an unbelievable unique flavor that I can't begin to explain, so you'll just have to order it next time. Other highlights are - The wedge salad, calamari with banana peppers and the best mac n' cheese ever, loaded with lobster chunks. The wine menu is huge and although I'm no wine aficionado, the waiters have always been knowledgeable in recommending a reasonably priced selection that tastes great.  The place isn't cheap, but I always leave here feeling like I've gotten my moneys worth. With that said, be sure to snag a reservation during Chicago's Restaurant Week. Unlike their competitors they don't downsize the portions and menu's for the fixed price offering. Your three courses meal end up being less than the price of a regular priced entree/steak.

When it comes to steak, I definitely prefer dry aged over wet aged and I was excited about coming here because they are one of the handful left in Chicago that actually dry age their steaks.

After sitting down, we had a look at their enormous drinks list and a friend of mine looked it over and ordered a malbec (I'm no wine connoissieur). I will say that it was decent with a little bit of a spiciness or bite to it at the end. For starters I had their clam chowder. I felt that it was only ok. I have definitely had better. The main course was their bone-in kona crusted dry aged sirloin with shallot butter - medium rare. It was fantastic. Tied for best steak I have ever eaten (but I have many more places to try). The flavor was excellent and it was somewhat tender (I would suppose in line with a sirloin cut). The warm redness was consistent throughout. Not under or overcooked in my opinion. The side dishes were decent, but nothing to write home about (mashed potatoes and fresh creamed spinach). For dessert I tried their handcrafted ice cream. It came out as a sampler trio of sorts - vanilla, chocolate, and mint with chocolate chip. All tasted excellent, rich and fresh. The mint was especially nice because the fresh mint flavor was very apparent (I think my palate is very used to store variety mint flavoring). Overall, the service was attentive, atmosphere was pretty much what you would expect for a steak joint, the food was a mix of excellent and ok. The steak and ice cream? 5 stars.

The restaurant week menu was a great steal for 32 bucks!  I love the bread here, especially that brown bread with the whipped butter. I tried the mixed green salad (WAY too much dressing.. ask for it on the side) and the Kona crusted sirloin. Yes coffee and steak? It's not a in your face flavor, but the Kona adds a smoky depth to the crust of the steak with a hint of Dijon (according to our waiter). And it is served with  SHALLOT BUTTER- totally delicious. The sirloin was definitely not as tender as my fond memory of the ribeye, but that is why I love ribeye in general- marblelization! Anyway they also served mashed potatoes and creamed spinach for sides which were both delicious but a little too heavy once they cooled down.  For dessert, I had the flourless chocolate espresso cake which is like  sooo heavy. I would def recommend getting some kind of coffee or something b/c it's hard to swallow after awhile. Tried the creme brulee- yum but nothing special, and the ice cream. The mango sorbet was a little too tart to eat a lot of. Split the half bottle of Tuscan Chianti- don't recommend this at all!

We were seated at about a quarter after eight.  We first ordered the shrimp cocktail, which was a bit mushy.  We both tried to order the lobster bisque, but were warned off of it by the waiter because my girlfriend is very allergic to eggs.  She thought this was odd since she's had lobster bisque before.  It all worked out for her, however, since she had the French onion soup instead, which she liked.  I had the lobster bisque and it had the consistency of melted cream cheese.  Not good. We then ordered steaks.  My girlfriend first ordered the tenderloin with butter-poached lobster.  The waiter informed us that eggs were used in poaching the lobster.  We both thought this was a little odd, but figured the waiter must be right.  My girlfriend had the filet with wild mushrooms instead.  I had the Kona-crusted sirloin.  I ordered my steak rare, but it was raw.  It was seared a little bit on the outside, but completely uncooked otherwise.  It was cold and red on the inside.  Not pinky red, raw meat red.  I tried a couple of bites, but wound up chewing each piece for about ten minutes.  Because the steak was raw, it was very hard to chew.   When the waiter asked how we were doing, I told him that the steak seemed uncooked, cold, and could not be chewed.  He offered to get me another one or heat up the one that I had, which was very nice of him, but I didn't want to wait around another twenty minutes or so for another steak or the one I had to be re-heated.  I didn't make a scene or ask that the steak be taken off the bill.  The restaurant's manager came out to speak to us and we told him that we thought the steak was not cooked.  He seemed to want to go with the story that I had got a ""bad cut of meat.""  Isn't that worse if you're in the steakhouse business?  He offered to take the steak off of the bill and I accepted. After our food was taken away, we decided to order dessert, just to try to clear away the bad atmosphere lingering from dinner.  I order the flourless chocolate cake and the girlfriend had coffee.  The waiter offered the girlfriend an extra fork for dessert.  She declined because the cake had eggs.  The waiter told us that the cake did *not* have eggs.  We simply did not believe this.  Every recipe for flourless chocolate cake that we had ever seen calls for eggs. We got through dessert quickly and left very disappointed. P.S. I thought the service was obtrusive, but my girlfriend did not.",-0.8993,0.892,0.041,0.067,0.41276355758063066

This is very much your typical old fashioned steak house.  There are animal heads all over the place, and everything appears leather-bound.  But if you go in knowing this, it won't disappoint.  We got there a bit early and indulged in a drink at the bar.  Their pineapple-infused martinis are fantastic.  Just one, though. We started with a bottle of wine, and noticed, as is pretty typical at these kinds of steak restaurants, that the upcharge on their menu is pretty insane.  But anywhoots...wine we had.  We also got the calamari, which is soaked in jalepanos...mmm, delicious.   For our entree, we each got a steak, but alas, could not agree on a side.  Fiance wanted au gratin potatoes, Sara wanted lobster mac n cheese...but saved by the waiter!  He told us he would do a half order of potatoes and a full order of mac n cheese.  He also swore that the au gratin potatoes were way better than the mac...but I sorely disagree...that mac n cheese was HEAVEN.  Huge pieces of lobster, creamy sauce.  I just gained 5 lbs thinking about it again.  The steak was amazing as well.  Cooked to absolute perfection... We had mentioned to the waiter that it was our anniversary and we had just gotten engaged, and he was nice enough to bring out a piece of cake and champagne for us.  What a nice touch.

2010-01-25,5.0,"Wow. My husband and I went here for dinner last night because his parents had given us a gift card for his birthday a few months ago. The only other time I've been to Captial Grille was in Boston over 7 years ago. Dear God, why have I waited so long to return?? Perhaps it's because I didn't remember it being quite this good. For starters let me say that the food was phenomenal, the service fantastic, and the ambiance spot on. We decided to begin dinner with a dirty martini (me) and a Sam winter (hubby). My martini was great, and arrived with either a choice of either regular or Blue cheese stuffed olives to complement my martini. Blue cheese please! My husband was jealous and kept stealing sips and eventually an olive.  I haven't decided if I've forgiven him for that yet... Then, after looking at the sizes of the steaks, we decided we would be plenty full by splitting one along with a few sides. Our waiter agreed (surprise, he didn't try to pressure us into adding an additional $40 to the tab). We ordered the 22 oz porcini rubbed delmonico, medium rare. Accompanied by a side of lobster mac and cheese, and a side of asparagus. Heavenly.  The steak arrived and they had pre split it for us. With each bite I thought it was certain I could die right then having been a VERY happy person. The steak was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was amazing.  The lobster mac and cheese was soooooooo freakin good. Huge pieces of lobster with the best cheese sauce and pasta. They sprinkled panko bread crumbs on top for a nice crunch. The asparagus was good, not great. I wish it had been grilled rather than steamed, then it wouldn't have needed the  hollandaise sauce.  But, to be fair, how was poor lil asparagus going to compete with creamy mac & cheese and perfectly cooked steak? It never really stood a chance.  Finally, as though that wasn't enough food, we decided to order dessert. We asked the waiter whether we should get the key lime pie or fresh strawberries (we were in the mood for something light). His response: the cheesecake. We laughed, but he insisted. So we decided just to go with it. So glad we did! They brûlée the top and put fresh berries in the side. They also cover the cheesecake in fresh strawberry purée. Omg. So happy we took his reco. All in all, absolutely orgasmic.",0.994,0.804,0.165,0.031,0.6216829466829467

2009-11-16,5.0,"I'm not sure that I can say much about the Capital Grille that you probably don't already know.  But it's simply one of the best steak places in Chicago along with Gibson's, Keefer's, and Harry Caray's. The dry aged steaks are ridiculously good, their balsamic-porcini rubbed Delmonico has to be tried to be believed, and to top it off the decor and ambiance is tops in the city.  Old school Chicago steakhouse cool, but big enough to not feel overcrowded and claustrophobic (like Gibson's). The waitstaff is awesome, nice, informative, and attentive, but do a good job of leaving you alone to enjoy your meal. If I had one complaint it's that I wish they had a bigger bar/lounge area like Gibson's does.  This is probably just a personal choice, but I tend to enjoy going to a restaurant hanging out in the bar/lounge and then ordering food if I get hungry, and I hate making reservations, so usually just hitting up a lounge and eating a full meal, or just an appetizer (depending on my mood)  is preferable to me.  But you can't really do that at The Capital Grille because the bar area is small and narrow so there aren't really any tables to speak of.  It's hard to take away any points for that though, since they're in the business of running a restaurant, not in the business of catering to my specific dining peculiarities.",0.976,0.79,0.152,0.058,0.48750640040962623

I had soup and half sandwich. The soup was tomato with filled pastas - tasty and interesting. The half sandwich was grill chicken on a pita-type bread. Excellent. A soft drink was included - I had coffee instead, which I expected them to charge me for. Nope, coffee instead of soft drink was fine. Their whole attitude was friendly and gracious.

I almost never eat dessert but talking to some of the other diners at the bar they recommended the creme brulee and I had a serving of port wine.  The creme brulee was done very well.  This place is tops in my book, not your average Chicago restaurant or even a place for everyday dining in this economy but once in a while it is satisfying to have such a good meal.",0.9703,0.892,0.108,0.0,0.5877083333333334

The balsamic vinegar burnt off and created a smoky, slightly burnt and mellow/tart, crust on the Delmonico cut.   The Lyonnaise potatoes were excellent, outsides were a little buttery, salty and crispy and were wonderful with the sweet caramelized Spanish onions. I would totally go back for just these.  Also had the seasonal fresh veggies which was mostly summer squash with a hint of lemon and buttery olive oil.   We also had the ice cream sandwich, which they split on two plates without us asking.

I am personally partial to New York Strip steaks rather than filets or ribeyes.  But every steak I have ever had at the Grille has been delicious and prepared exactly to my liking.  The Strip in particular is always a nice thick cut where medium rare allows a nice full searing on the outside while still making room for plenty of red-pink interior. The mashed potatoes are like swimming in a creamy cloud of buttery starchy lusciousness.  The chocolate mousse will send you into a deep chocolate slumber rendering you unable to even leave your seat when it is time to leave.  It's not exactly tough to find a good steakhouse in Chicago.  While Capital Grille doesn't exactly have authentic Chicago personality or history, it wouldn't be a bad place to start looking.",0.9928,0.825,0.162,0.014,0.5552095871608067

I ordered the fillet with lobster and was definitely not disappointed.  Everyone else had some other type of fillet, strip, etc and no one had any complaints.  The lobster mac-n-cheese side dish was awesome - give it a try.

2009-04-21,5.0,"This is a story about meat.  About really, really, really fabulous meat (and calamari) at the Capital Grille!   After reading a lengthy and heated rant on chowhound over the best steak in Chicago, my friend and I found that we had an undeniably strong taste for steak.  The overall winner in the online, steak-off appeared to be Capital Grille or DB Primehouse.  The problem is that I'd become steak shy.  In September of 2008 I had a ribeye at Delmonico's in New York that was so richly flavorful that red meat eaters anywhere would gladly debase themselves just for one medium rare forkful.  Or at least I would.  Now every steak I've had since then has left me unsatisfied, out about $100 and desperately missing that nirvana-like, perfectly cooked, cut of meat I had last year.  Until now... Although it is not on the lunch menu, today I had Capital Grille's 22oz bone in ribeye (the bone takes up quite a bit of that weight).  The steak can be prepared with a dry rub of salt, pepper and some other spice then crusted with porcini mushrooms and laced with an aged balsamic.  It sounded delicious, but I'm an old school steak eater...good meat does not need anything but salt, pepper and a flame that takes it to medium rare, so that is how I ordered it.  On the other hand, I also like to play a bit so I also ordered the fried onions and béarnaise sauce on the side.   This was heaven on a plate.  The steak was PERFECTLY cooked, excellent quality and texture, the ideal amount of marbling throughout, juicy and amazingly flavorful.  Due to the flavor of the steak I did not eat much of the onions or béarnaise.  Every bite amazed me over and over again.  I do believe I shed a small tear. My friend, being more adventurous with her steaks, ordered the sirloin with a kona coffee bean crust and shallot butter.  I tasted it.  I thought ""whatever."" I hungrily returned to my perfect and naturally flavored slab of meat.  However - if you like different rubs, seasonings and flavoring on your steak, then you'll probably like the Kona sirloin or some of the other tasty offerings.   Almost forgot, before gorging on red meat, we enjoyed the calamari app.  I didn't care one way or the other about ordering it, as many places prepare it the same deep fried, slap it on a plate and then claim they've made it special by throwing some single spice on it.  But oh no!  That is not the way they do it at Capital Grille. This calamari is pan friend 'til crispy and mixed and tumbled and sizzled with some garlic, some type of peppers and butter.  The flavor of the peppers perfectly complement the calamari!  I never would have known that, but then again I'm not a chef.  The amount of butter is up to Goldilock's specifications: not too much, not too little but just right.  Absolutely phenomenal!  If anyone knows of better calamari than this, I'd be very interested in trying it.  Please let me know. I should also mention that the service was outstanding.  We were warmly greeted at the door by the Hostess and Manager, who checked in with us a couple times during our meal.  Our waiter was professional, friendly, attentive and recommended a merlot that rolled over the tongue and was an ideal accompaniment to the ribeye. Also, I do like the decor and high ceilings, but really they could serve that ribeye out of a shack and I'd be happy. I am so very happy to have returned to Capital Grille and found that the ribeye of my dreams is only blocks away from my office.  Thank you for a delightful lunch CG!",0.9993,0.756,0.216,0.028,0.561761492475778

The service was excellent. Our server wished him a Happy Birthday when we arrived and there was a card for him at the table. We started with the salad of field greens because we felt we should order some kind of veggie, however, it was small and basic and not worth the 9 bucks. He had the porterhouse and I had the filet. Our server told me about the different rubs that they offer and I tried the Kona coffee rub. It was fantastic. The steak literally melted in my mouth. The porterhouse was also very flavorful. For sides we ordered the au gratin potatoes and the lobster mac n'cheese (now you see why we needed some veggies!). Both sides were outstanding. The mac n'cheese had large pieces of sweet, tender lobster in a rich and creamy cheese sauce. The potatoes were tender and cheesy with a wonderful crispy topping. Our server brought out a complimentary slice of the flourless chocolate cake with a single lit candle for the birthday boy. The cake tasted like a giant truffle, I savored every bite. My husband also ordered a slice of the Key lime pie (which was also complimentary). It was very creamy and limey. It was good, but I personally prefer chocolate. He said it was just good. Finally, our server took our picture and sent it home with us. My husband really enjoyed his birthday there and we loved the food. We needed directions to get to our next location and the hostess asked several servers until one of them could answer that. Really appreciated the excellent service. The manager even followed up with a phone call the next day. I definitely recommend the Capital Grille and would celebrate there in the future.",0.9949,0.83,0.166,0.004,0.566701680672269

The menu looked great and it wasn't that crowded so we thought we were in for a treat.  We are all pretty attractive, and well-dressed people....you will see why I say this in a moment.

He is very picky about where he sits anyway, so the little girl that tried to seat us there was quickly corrected. There are many other places in Chicago and around the country that have better food and better service. You can get a nice meal and be treated with respect anywhere but here.

2009-02-13,5.0,"One of my mantras is ""life is in the details"" and no restaurant has really exemplified that until I visited The Capital Grille last night. One of the best things about The Capital Grille in my mind is that it doesn't feel in the least like it is part of a chain or restaurant group. In fact, there are Capital Grille restaurants pretty much everywhere, but they are able to keep everything from the greeting to the final valet intimate but professional. And the food is outstanding. My recent venture was a birthday gift from my dearest friend. After a drink at the bar, the bartender told us to stay put and that someone would be by to get us. I'd forgotten all etiquette since it had been so long since I'd been to such a nice place, but we were whisked away before I could think another minute on it. Once we were shown to the table I noticed an envelope with on the table that said ""Happy Birthday"". I suspected my date had it planted there, but in fact contained within was an elegant note card signed by the Capital Grille management. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and personable and gave us time to look across the menu and listen to the specials. We both started with Capital Grille's Caesar salad that was deemed by both of us as Best of Class ... and believe me, we are Caesar salad snobs. The lemony-dressing, one-of-a-kind ""crust plus"" croutons and wide planks of shaved Parmesan truly catapulted Capital Grille's Caesar to the top. We both ordered steaks and split a side of their impossibly crunchy-topped Au Gratin potatoes. Perfectly cooked with a rich sauce, they were the perfect foil to my lean filet. Anyone who has read me here before knows that I'm not too keen on restaurant desserts. In general, I don't think they are very good, and most are over-priced for the quality. I had my suspicion, with the card as my first clue, that I was going to be subjected to the ""SBD"", special birthday dessert, the remains of what would typically be thrown away that night with the addition of a candle on a plate with ""Happy Birthday"" having been written on it days before and stored in the freezer. I'd heard other stories about how Capital Grille is different and we, in fact, received a large slice of their ""popular"" flourless chocolate cake and 2 glasses of sparkling wine. It was perfectly lovely, not the SBD, but not the Feast of Desserts I'd heard about from others celebrating their birthday there. The gesture was not ignored and the cake was very good, but I didn't get a taste before the waitress offered to snap a photo and print it out for us. I protested for a moment owing to my ""No Photographic Evidence"" rule, but the lens was dirty and the photo was blurry enough that you couldn't really tell it was us. In the end I was, as I always have been, very happy with my experience at The Capital Grille and have no reservations in recommending it for a special occasion or business luncheon or dinner.",0.9984,0.766,0.186,0.049,0.601312292358804

We started out with half a dozen raw oysters.  Although delicious, I feel that smaller oysters are much tastier and these were far larger than I'd expected.  The apple vinegar sauce they had was the best, although my boyfriend hated it. I had a Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 12-Year Aged Balsamic (medium).  The waitress described the Delmonico as sort of a ""bone in ribeye"" but the texture was nothing close.  It just wasn't as moist as most ribeyes I've had but regardless, the taste was delightful.  The  Balsamic wasn't overwhelming and complemented the steak perfectly, softening the strong taste of the Porcini. My boyfriend had the Filet Mignon (medium rare) which was served in an au jus with hints of mushroom.  It was cooked to perfection and practically melted in your mouth.  I'd have to say his Filet was definitely 10x better than my steak.

2008-07-30,4.0,"Went to Capital Grille a few months back with a client for lunch. I hadn't heard a whole lot about it at the time but live nearby, so I became curious after walking by so many times. I was a little wary of the fact that it is in a hotel AND a chain, but gave it a shot anyway. The restaurant itself is gorgeous. I loved the dark wood and old school feel. We were seated in a small, empty room toward the back, which made things a little bit awkward and date-ish feeling with my (older, male) client. Luckily he is someone I know well enough that it wasn't a big deal, but I could see where it may have caused some awkwardness in a different situation. Perhaps this is where they sit their OpenTable ""VIP"" reservations, or they just thought that I was his mistress. I was a huge fan of the substitution of black napkins when our server noted that we were both wearing dark colors. Though now I expect this everywhere! Our server was knowledgeable and not overly attentive, which is exactly how I like it. I had the filet with the kona rub and mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare), but I could have done without the kona as I did not taste it at all. The mashed potatoes were fine; not totally memorable but they served their carb-o-licious purpose.

Thick, dry-aged hunks of beef seared at such a high temperature that all the juicy goodness is trapped inside, then finished to a perfect temperature.

I started with the calamari appetizer.  This was truly a treat!  The calamari was very lightly breaded and was also served with hot cherry peppers.  Not your usual calamari, my friends. I think I might have misordered on my entree, though.  I ordered the lobster and crab burger.  The bun was waaaaaaaaay too big to eat the sandwich as an actual burger.  The burger itself was surprisingly bland, considering it was made with lobster and crab.  Maybe they were trying not to cover up the sweetness of the lobster and crab, but the result was rather flavorless.  I ordered mine with a side of homemade potato chips.  I consider myself somewhat of a homemade chip fanatic.  These did not fit the bill.  Again, they needed some salt or pizazz or something.

2008-05-28,4.0,"This is what I would call your baseline, high end, franchised restaurant.  Now I write that not as a bad thing....so let me explain. Capital Grill, though they differ from city to city in their look and feel, offer a consistent menu with what I consider excellent service and food. But I would recommend that you focus on the steaks as I feel they excel in how they prepare 2 inch+ steaks...which is a talent (given the right quality of meat and profession grilling equipment *wink*). The food is not cheap, but again it speaks to the level of quality.   Wine and grain alcohol selection is extensive.  There are affordable bottles of wine in the $30 to $40 range. This is both a special occasion as well as a ""treat myself to a great dinner"" place.  Go after the happy hour crowd departs...typically after 7pm and dine in this establishment during the week versus weekends as they can be crowded due to tourists.  You'll see MANY business dinners occurring in this establishment.  I cannot comment on lunches at this time, mainly for the fact I'd never pay those prices for a lunch....dinner yes, lunch, never. Service is dead on.  Tip accordingly. Reservations can be made via their website and I'd recommend this if you eat in the ""sweet spot"" between 6pm and 8pm. For this location, I'd recommend a booth, facing the kitchen grill area, but farthest away from the hall to the bathrooms (which are considerably down the hall).  The view and activity will add to the eating experience.  Stay away from the tables facing the kitchen and in the bar area.....too much noise and traffic. Valet your car if you drive.  It is $12, but parking decks near by  will cost more than $16.  Just don't stay longer than 3 hours as there is an extra charge. I recently ordered the chopped salad...which had a bit of spicy to it with sliced banana peppers....which I felt was great.  Next was the 14oz Sirlon.....a BIG piece of meet.  Personally I'd recommend eating no more than 10oz of meet in this place if you get anything else with your meal, e.g. appetizers, salad, etc.  There will be a ton of food. Also, keep in mind if you eat along the side dishes can be ""halfed"" if you request it, but the wait staff should proactively make the suggestion. You should be brought a hot towel after your cocktail, but before your first food item arrives. This is a high end place everyone should treat themselves to every once in a while (meat eaters that is.....).",0.9958,0.856,0.138,0.006,0.4905899470899471

Truth is, we were wearing jeans because we hadn't planned in advance to come here. I was taking my best friend out for a belated birthday meal and we showed up around 5:45 for an early dinner. The hostess was incredibly rude and for some reason asked for our last name (even though we told her we had no reservation). What did they need that for? They'd never asked me before. Then we were placed in a really crappy table in back when the place was more or less empty. The server we had was pretty cool. But there was this general air of condescension, especially when we were leaving... ""Come back again...IF YOU CAN"". Maybe I'm just paranoid, but I wasn't pleased with the tone or choice of words.

2007-09-12,5.0,"This is a really random story, but I think it speaks to both the superior food and amazing service provided by the Capital Grille in Chicago.   My friend May and I both are IT consultants who recently began working in Chicago Monday thru Thursday (we previously worked on the same project near Boston and have kept in touch).  Last night were walking from the W on Lakeshore, trying to find a decent place to eat, possibly outside.  We walked into Cafe Bice to get on the waiting list for an outdoor table a little after 7pm, and May literally ran into a guy inside the door holding a gift box.  He was a bit older but dressed better than most 25-30 year olds in the restaurant, great hair plugs that looked pretty real, cool mod glasses - really the only thing that gave away his age was his face was craggy (not in a bad way).  He made a joke to May that the gift was for her, she said ""how did you know my size?"" (she's a little Asian girl) and he guessed she was a size 2 - exactly right.  They started joking around for about another minute, he introduces himself as ""Commander"" and asks us if we wanted to join him and a few of his friends for dinner across the street at the Capital Grille.  May and I decided, hey, what the hell - our per diem can't afford us to eat at Capital Grille much, but we were in an adventurous mood. We walk into the Capital Grille and everyone, from the Hostess to the Bus Boy, is greeting Commander, slapping him on the back, kissing his cheeks, basically kissing his a$$.  May and I exchange glances, but figure he said he had lived in Chicago for years - maybe they know their loyal guests here?  Anyway, then Commander mentions he has a wine locker at the Capital Grille here in Chicago (as well as in NY, Philly and Vegas) and the wine we'll be drinking tonight will be one of the best we'll ever taste.  This point is about when we figure out that they're treating us to dinner - very nice of them but certainly not necessary!!   We get seated quickly at a table in the back, near the kitchen, in its own little room, and more C.G. employees keep stopping by to say hi to Commander.  There are 7 of us in the room at this point - Commander, his friends Jimmy (a ""game broker"" - he sells wild game to restaurants and claims he can get any animal except Polar Bear, cause its illegal); Jerry, a ""alternative travel agent"" whose business card claims complete discretion for vacation planning; Nancy, a ball-busting uber-successful IBM mainframe saleswoman; ""Big John"", Commander's ""money collection guy""; and Renee, the girl Commander met in China last year when he was in business that he has flown in for a few days - she looks about 22 years old.   The sommelier brings over a decanter of red wine, and pours Commander some, who agrees that its great, so we all get some - and I am not a red wine expert by any means, but its damn good wine.  The guy next to me, Jimmy, tells me its $400+ a decanter.  (Over the course of the night, we order 4 more.)  We order appetizers, and only May, Renee and I need to look at the menu.  May isn't a huge red meat fan, so she gets the halibut special, and I order the smaller filet mignon (with the side of wild mushrooms, per Jimmy's suggestion).  All of our food was freaking phenomenal - my filet was amazing and I have been to some pretty great steakhouses on my company's dime - and pairs excellently with the wine.  I tried May's fish and that was pretty great, too - but I am so glad I got steak.   During dinner, Commander is whispering sweet nothings to little Renee, and they start snuggling up together as Nancy tells us how she conquered a man's world, Jimmy talks about eating kangaroo, wild boar, dog (icky), etc and Jerry tells us about some of the trips he's booked (no names, obviously).  During all this, the waiter and sommelier observe all of the absurdity, but maintain their professionalism - thank god or May and I may have busted out laughing. After dinner, Commander insists that we all have a sambuca and espresso, so I am staring at the two drinks in front of me - there are three coffee beans floating in the sambuca.  Commander makes us take a sip the sambuca with a coffee bean at a time, grinding the coffee bean in our mouth.  After eating all the beans, you dump the espresso into the sambuca and drink the rest of it.  During this, the waiter brings out a camera and takes pictures of our group, then prints off copies for Renee - and for May and I after we ask for one, otherwise our friends will not believe us when we try to explain what happened. Then they bring out some of the most amazing things I have ever tried - a rich creamy cheesecake with strawberries, a flourless chocolate cake, and a tart key lime pie - plus a coconut cream tart.  When the bill comes, Commander and Jerry discretely pay, and Commander is a bit in the bag, but hey - he just spent a $hitload on dinner, so we laugh at his off color jokes - but it really was amusing.",0.9995,0.791,0.182,0.027,0.5093474426807759

I had the filet mignon, which was cooked exactly how I liked it; barely seasoned, sizzling hot, and just the right amount of medium-rare. The broccoli au gratin is always good if you're a cheese fan, the potatoes delish, and the strawberries.. mmmmm. If you want the best server in the house - ask for Aaron.",0.9955,0.712,0.268,0.02,0.5917658730158731

2006-06-02,4.0,My fat ass ate so much at this restuarant I dont know how I rolled out.  We ordered the Calamari with peppers and I felt oily and bloated after eating it.  Usually fried calamari at upscale restaurants are light but this one really coated my round belly.  The french onion soup was very good here.  I am fat and I eat alot of french onion soup.  My manatee order fish (manatees only eat seafood) and I had the bone in ribeye recommened by the waiter.  The steak was similar to Ruth Chris and pretty impressive  The fish was not very good.  I would definitely not recommend eating seafood here and I was shocked the fish cost more than my steak!  Serves my fat ass right for bringing a fish eater with me.  I will definitely go back if I ever visit Chitown again.,0.9423,0.762,0.159,0.079,0.48484737484737483

If you aren't in the mood for a steak this probably isn't the best place for you because the menu isn't accomodating to many other types of meals.

2005-10-17,5.0,"The best filet mignon I've ever eaten was served at the Capital Grille. A critical aspect of fine meat is the aging process, and the Capital Grille has it down to an art. The environment is classic steakhouse - white linen tablecloths and an attentive staff. One thing I found lacking were the sides - they were a bit dry and uninspired. I enjoy the standard mashed potatoes as much as the next person, but I expect them to be creamy soft buttery, not stiff and lumpy.",0.5346,0.907,0.073,0.02,0.40703703703703703
