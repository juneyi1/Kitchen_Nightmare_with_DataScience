I thought I was ordering something similar to stir fry with quinoa as the rice. My quinoa was soaked in a curry sauce. I could not really see the quinoa texture because of the all of the sauce it was swimming in next to the bean juice. Majority of my mixed veggies was cabbage with two pieces of broccoli. The best part of the dish was the black beans. My family and I would usually order the chicken alfredo which is delicious. I would rate the chicken alfredo five stars and the quinoa platter slop only 2 stars.

Couldn't finish them, even. But the quality was terrible. I had a chicken Caesar salad. The dressing was greasy and thin, in no way resembling the delicate emulsion of egg yolks, mustard, and garlic that form the foundation of a proper Caesar. On top of it was overcooked and tough chicken breast chunks In a rather strange sauce that clashed furiously with the oily concoction dominating the lettuce. A few limp and work tomatoes slices made their mealy presence known as a splash of sad color on top.  My colleague faired little better with a quinoa plate that did - in fairness - contain quinoa as a minority ingredient. There were some other vaguely Indian vaguely Mexican stews ladled nearby.  The lone highlight was the plantains in jerk sauce. Acidic and sharp, the peppery spice made up for the mushiness of the plantains which would have done better crisped and highlighted by the sauce than bathing in it.  This neighborhood is a culinary wasteland, unfortunately. There just isn't much here.

The cornbread is over sweet, the collard greens were just horrible, and that ""Chcken Tikka"" aka Marsala NEEDS to be taken off the menu entirely.  The dish reminds me of being a child, before your mother goes shopping she gets rid of all the leftovers, so she throws it all together to make something, well this was worse It has boiled potatoes, not roasted like stated on phone, when asked is that all right?  Then rice which was not edible because the seasonings is overpowering, and then some  I DON""T  what kind of cabbage or what it was, but it very was bitter. Oh and it came with garlic bread. ""The description read, in a creamy spicy sauce"", NOPE, it was DRY and too many fighting seasoning. I only had a few pieces of cut up chicken, and too much curry or something, the dish made NO SENSE whatsoever.  The dish was not at all what it was described to be, and certainly was NO MARSALA  just  A bunch of stuff thrown in a container,the only thing worth eating was the Swiss Chard.

For my meal, I ordered the half roasted chicken, which came with pita bread, veggies, and rice.  I opted for red beans for an extra $0.75, which were served on top of the rice.  At the end of my meal, I also got a piece of cheesecake to go.  I also had to try the lemonade, so I got a small bottle of it to accompany my meal.  My food was served about 10 min. after ordering, and was brought out to the table fast casual style. I was quite pleased with the quality of the food, given the location and price.  The chicken was succulent and juicy with pleasantly caramelized, well-seasoned skin.  The veggies were also well-cooked and not mushy, and the red beans were a nice touch.  The cheesecake was good, making for a nice dessert once I returned to the hotel.  The standout item was the lemonade, though, which had just the right amount of sweetness, striking an elusive balance between the tartness of Minute Maid and the cloying sweetness of Auntie Anne's. Overall, I was quite pleased with my experience at Chef Luciano, and I'd recommend it for people attending an event at McCormick Place as a nice change of pace from the limited options in the convention center and hotel.  If you happen to be in this part of Chicago, check it out!",0.9761,0.857,0.117,0.025,0.5414835164835164

If you're looking for something a little different, the Piri Piri is unique and delicious with a melange of interesting flavors and tasty sides, and the chicken tikka dish with some habaneros to kick it up a bit was so damn satisfying that after several months separation, it's become a painful memory for me.

You see, Kuma's (a stellar review is coming) doesn't have dessert, and what the Ivory Shack peddles I didn't want. Greeted by the lovely Kassandra D, I opted for a serving of their tiramisu, which I took to the White Castle's outdoor dining area and relished defiantly with a spork.  Cloudy, ethereal, the espresso-drenched lady fingers melted into my tongue as did the cocoa-dusted whipped cream (dream?) of sugar, eggs, and mascarpone. Sweet danced with the slightly  bitter, segueing into a moment of sheer comfort in the midst of an eventful and somewhat hectic weekend in a large, unfamiliar metropolis.  I now have a strange theory regarding Tiramisu: It didn't come from Italy. It came from Shangri-La. At least Chef Luciano's does.

2014-08-10,5.0,Was staying at the Hyatt Regency McCormick Place down the street and found good reviews on Yelp about the chicken at this joint.  This chicken at this place was OFF THE HOOK!  I ordered the 1/2 roasted chicken white meat plate with rice and it was delish. My chicken was served directly from their oven and had this fantastic indian creole spicy kick to it. DELICIOUS!  I've never had chicken like this before and will definitely come back for another meal the next time I'm in Chicago on business.,0.9295,0.83,0.149,0.021,0.6027777777777779

2014-08-06,3.0,"I thought there would be a few more cajun/creole options coming to this place based on Yelp, but it is more like a fusion of all of different cuisines with an emphasis on Italian I would say. But at lunch, you get one of the largest portions ever for about $8-9 so that is a steal since I didn't even need dinner that night after my trip here ha ha But big portions are not what wins me over, and the pesto chicken pasta was a great buy price wise since the lunch deal includes a drink and garlic bread too, but was it the best pesto in the world? Of course not. But was it pretty good? Yes, yes it was. Matt J. got their fish special and upgraded to quinoa for $1 more which is also a good deal. There was a sign in here explaining what quinoa was which I appreciated being an avid quinoa eater myself ha ha And again it was a large portion, came with veggies and such, so was a nice healthy lunch choice that was filling and affordable. But again not overly flavorful, but good nonetheless. So if you are in the area and need a quick lunch, this is a great option!

When you walk in, you can choose to go to the Gourmet Chicken side of the restaurant to the right or the Chef Luciano's side to the left. I went to the Chef Luciano side, and ordered the Jerk Chicken and my friend ordered the Piri Piri.  Skip the Jerk Chicken. They use some kind of sauce that does not taste remotely like Jerk Chicken. The sauce reminds me of those commercials for the salsa where they say, ""New York City?!?"" - well the Jerk Chicken sauce tastes like it was made in New York City. Just don't.  Now the Piri Piri on the other hand was off the chain. Delicious. Surprisingly good. I would absolutely get that again. It is a bit spicy, but also has a smoky flavor, and it is seasoned very well. Piri Piri is an African dish, which features peppers along w/okra and carrots. This is a great hidden gem. If you want something different and tasty, get the Piri Piri.

Since they remodeled the entire place it's now less confusing with a single entryway, you just have to decide to turn right for fried stuff and left for spicy and savory stuff :) It's also great for dine-in now as there are a few tables where before I think there was literally one table. There is also one little private room with a table that seats 4 or 6 and can be reserved.  They have fresh-made lemonade but it doesn't taste juiced, more like from a mix from what I remember.

2009-04-14,3.0,"I am visiting Chicago for a conference at McCormick Place West.  After experiencing the food court there yesterday, I decided I had to try to find something else for lunch today.  So I figured the best chance I had of finding food was over near S. Michigan.  Immediately ruling out the nearby Burger King, I looked further down Cermak, saw signs for a restaurant, it was Chef Luciano, so I decided to give it a try. While it looks like there are a couple tables, it is mainly a takeaway and delivery place.  It was pretty busy on a Tuesday, and I got the impression that most of the people there were regulars. There was a wide range of food options, mainly chicken and seafood.  There are also some pasta options; it is a pretty extensive menu. I decided to try the Jerk chicken.  I have to confess that, having been to Jamaica a few times, I have a serious opinion of what constitutes proper Jerk.  Like so many restaurants in the US, this wasn't it.  But this was good. For $12.95 I got a big, big helping of takeaway food.  There was a good quantity of chicken, in a spicy red sauce.  The chicken was nicely cooked, very tender, and just peeled off the bone.  The sauce had a little bit of zip to it, but was not too hot (but then again, I like hot food so if you are not into hot stuff, take my comments with a grain of salt).  Along with the chicken there are generous portions of potato, stir fried vegetables (cabbage, carrot, broccoli), plantains, and black beans and rice.  And some bread with some sort of butter/garlic sauce (it had a bit of a reddish tint to it, unlike most garlic bread that I'm used to, but it tasted good).  The plantains were in the jerk sauce, and were good.  Heck, it was all pretty good. So to anyone at McCormick West, it's just a block past Michigan on Cermak, just a couple blocks from the north end of the building.  While my meal was not cheaper than what is offered at the convention center food court, there was a whole hell of a lot more food (I'm a big eater and I couldn't finish everything).  The food choices are definitely a lot more interesting than the food court. It is certainly not the best food I've ever eaten, but I quite enjoyed it and would certainly go back if I ever have another conference at McCormick Place West.  And I have to confess, I do appreciate the quantity of food I got.   I won't be hungry any time soon.",0.993,0.808,0.149,0.044,0.5178976352445741
