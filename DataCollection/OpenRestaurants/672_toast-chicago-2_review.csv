Keep in mind the restaurant was almost entirely full and was bustling with several tables eating and ordering. The staff was super attentive and accommodating. My caprese sandwich was extremely generously packed with mozzarella and ultra-fresh tomato, with the most delicious bread. The potato salad I ordered was equally great, some of the best I've had before! My boyfriend had the marscapone/pine nut pancakes which he said were ""unique, spiced with fresh herbs and berries"". He said it was filling and special but he would try something else if he went again. We both enjoyed a drink from their special list, called a Ruth Bade Gin-spurg. It was a specialty drink with elderflower liquor, caramelized ginger, and ginger beer. It was fantastic! I would definitely order it again. Overall I would come back to eat, although the price was a bit steep at $46 for pancakes, a sandwich and 2 drinks. Yum!",0.9952,0.754,0.246,0.0,0.5861678004535147

He assured her that he always leaves 20% and if that was not the case it was a mistake. She proceeded to tell him that if he doesn't leave at least 20% this time, then he won't be allowed back in the restaurant. She explained that they keep lists of customers who do not ""tip well enough"" and if they come back in, the manager apparently has a little chat with them like this. I do not condone this behavior in a manager and find it utterly rude and disrespectful that she would approach a customer in this manner.

I usually go after 11 and have no problem finding a seat. But I also don't arrive with 7 people thinking I should be sat in five minutes. If the wait is taking forever, blame the jerks camping out rudely when it's obviously busy and on a wait. The meals are always out within 10-15 mins. The service is exemplary if you're being realistic. In short, they are doing fine work with the space given and the obviously pretentious clientele who go there not wanting to wait with odd-numbered groups and then camping out and making other equally pretentious odd-numbered groups angry while the Toast staff burn through 2-tops and 4-tops all day. My suggestion is if you come in a large group offer to split up!  Genius, no?

I was a bit worried at first that it wouldn't fill me up, but it comes with house potatoes and a choice of bread so I was very satisfied with the portions. The brioche with butter and jam spread is unreal...I literally dream about it all the time now. Only downside of this place is that it's very small and there's usually a wait time. My boyfriend and I are usually seated right away when we walked in or we wait a couple of minutes (sometimes the wait is 30-45 minutes).  The only thing I find offputting about this place is if one person in your party orders bottomless coffee, you're not allowed to take even a sip of their coffee otherwise they bring you your own bottomless coffee and charge you for it.

My first time here though, I didn't get why my friends loved this place - but I will admit it was because of a poor order (the pepper eggs are just kinda meh). I'm a big fan of the BELT sandwich, the Tijuana omelette, and the French toast. The service is what I like most, though. We always have the same waitress (how do I not know her name at this point?!), who takes our order quickly and nicely. Even the guys who refill your water glasses - they are pretty cool and friendly too. Downside is people in the neighborhood love this place, and it's a bit small so there's usually a decent wait - 20-45 minutes. I like to hit up the Starbucks across Halsted to kill the time.

2016-05-10,5.0,"I've been to Toast numerous times over the years and I think it's absolutely fantastic from a breakfast perspective as I've never had something off the lunch menu.  While they do have alcoholic drinks available, this isn't a place where you're really going to be for a few hours and have unlimited mimosas and come out stumbling so I'm judging it from that perspective.  However, if you're looking for a place to go with your family or a few friends for a quick bite to eat, this is your place.  I usually get the breakfast burrito adding avocado, chorizo and spinach which never disappoints.  The other day I got the tomato and goat cheese soup and it was really good. However, you have to be reasonable as it isn't a big place so there can be a wait and certainly a wait on a nice day or on a big weekend (e.g., Mother's Day).  Further, due to the size, they don't have many servers so you have to take that into account but I've never had any service issues.   As a note, I probably wouldn't go there with more than 4 people as they would probably have a  more difficult time from a seating perspective.",0.6243,0.92,0.061,0.019,0.4623376623376623

I would have previously given Toast a 4 or 5 star review, but after our experience today I was highly disappointed...and we didn't even eat there! My sister and I arrived early to get a table while the rest of our family was searching for parking. We informed the host that we would be a party of five and he explained that he would not seat us until the entire party was there. Understandable. He informed us he has a table for us and would seat our party at said table once the rest of the family arrived.  While we waited for the rest of the family to park and arrive, we asked if we could enjoy a mimosa while we waited. Another disappointment. We were informed that they do not serve customers who are waiting cocktails. Ridiculous!!  A couple moments later, another family of five walked in and was seated at immediately at the table that was promised to us. The rest of my family was just about to walk in. The host informed us that unfortunately he had given the table away. We clearly had noticed that sir.... I understand that restaurants need to establish such policies, however I find it highly frustrating that the host was incredibly rude and not willing to accommodate our party who was about to arrive / gave our table away to a group that arrived after we did.

The eggs were light and fluffy and the pesto was great and the tomatoes were fresh. The roasted potatoes were also great. Not overly seasoned, not crispy, and a little bit of garlic (I think?). The scramble also came with bread (we got multi grain) and butter/jam. The jam was very good.  Breakfast Burrito (minus jalapenos): So good! Not massive, which is always nice.

Seated, we were brought water immediately, but the waiter took a while to show up.  I had the crabby Benedict, which was good, though the hollandaise seemed a little overwhelmingly sweet, and there was quite a bit of it on the plate.  The eggs were perfectly poached, which was good to see.  The potatoes were fine, pan-fried but a little overdone in spots.  However, my friend took a few bites of her Ahi tuna and informed me that it tasted...old.  The waiter took it back and she ordered the beet salad instead, which arrived within minutes, but it's a little disturbing that a restaurant that's this busy is serving bad fish.  My request for more coffee and cream took a while -- when the waiter returned with the beet salad, he remembered and then had to come back again with it.  On the plus side, the coffee was excellent. My friend paid, and reported that she was not charged for the tuna or the salad, so I give Toast credit for that at least.  We sat for a while, but realized that more people were pouring in, so we stopped at the restroom (disconcertingly behind a curtain in the back, which feels like intruding into service areas) and headed out.  Overall, the food was a mixed bag (good Benedict, bad fish...), but the service was pretty inattentive, even for a busy Saturday morning.  As others have mentioned, the specials were not pointed out to us, and I just have a hard time with our experience given the vast number of other options in the immediate area.  Next time, I'll try one of them.  For me, Toast was not worth the wait.",0.9529,0.811,0.114,0.075,0.4899122807017544

2015-06-07,1.0,"I went to Toast with a friend for brunch yesterday and it was honestly the worst brunch experience I've had in my life. The wait for a table for two was 35 minutes, which wasn't bad, so we went to the park to wait. When we came back, the hostess was gone and she had took the list of names with her, so we had to wait for her to come back from wherever to seat us.  They put paper sheets over table cloths on the table, but whoever had had our table previously spilled something oily and it had sunk through the previous paper sheet, because the actual tablecloth was saturated in it and it absorbed through our paper sheet as well. The waitress was friendly enough, but not really attentive. When she brought our food, she mixed up who ordered what, and brought me toast despite me saying that I didn't want it because I don't eat carbs.  The food itself was totally lackluster. I ordered the smoked salmon omelette, tomato slices instead of toast, and a side of bacon. The omelette included a cheese that was not the one listed on the menu and totally overpowered everything else. The eggs were not seasoned and tasted watery and bland. The sliced tomatoes as well as the tomatoes in the omelette were clearly mass produced GMO ones, because the size and colour were so large and pale and they were wholly flavourless. And, my biggest gripe, the bacon was burnt.  It wasn't until we were on our way out after paying that we learned that there were specials. My order would have been different if I had known earlier. Also on our way out, the hostess was texting in the corner by the window. The highlight of my Toast experience was the busser, who was the most attentive staff member to us. He was frequently at our table making jokes and asking questions. He was a sweetheart. Also, this wasn't relevant for us, but for anyone else. On the menu, it states that children must use inside voices, that they will not split checks for you, and that if you do split a check on your own there is a limit of two credit cards per group. So, keep that in mind when you choose where to brunch.",0.9801,0.91,0.08,0.01,0.5305643738977073

2015-05-03,1.0,"Just left Toast after waiting *an hour and a half* for a three-top that the hostess said would be around a 30-minute wait. After about 30 minutes, we wandered inside to see if our table was almost ready and were assured it would be ""just a few more minutes."" After *another* half an hour, we were still waiting. And look, I understand that when a restaurant is busy and popular it can be difficult to predict the timing. But there's a big difference between ""a few more minutes"" and an entire additional half hour. At a minimum, the hostess should have come to us at some point and apologized because, say, a closed table was just sitting there taking up space. Instead, we got zero communication and continually had to ask her for updates - and as a bonus, she had this annoyed look on her face like we were somehow imposing by asking for an update when *she* was the one not doing her damn job. Finally, a four-top clears up and she tells us (because we ask, not because she's paying attention to us) we're next. Sweet! My irritation begins melting away at the prospect of imminent food availability. And then another four-top right next to it opens up too. Cool - we must've just gotten caught up in a rush that just abated. Cool deal, hostess could've been nicer, but whatevs. And what happens next? This rude hostess pushes three of the tables together to make a seven-top and gives it to someone below us on the list. BEYOND annoying, although I can sort of understand from a restaurant management perspective, and I see that another table is about to get up. Just one problem - this idiot incompetent hostess has pushed together the *middle* tables, meaning there is an empty two-top on one side and and closing two-top on the other. So instead of leaving the empty two-top next to the clearing two-top she could use to make a three- or four-top, she now has two two-tops. We ask her what's going on and she says ""oh, it'll be just a couple minutes, another table is about to leave. But I can turn this table so you three can sit there."" Lol no. This table is not built for three people. So we say we'll wait for this supposed table about to leave and she gives the little table to a party of two behind us. So for those keeping count, we've now been passed by a party of seven and a party of two who have been waiting less than the 1:25 we've been waiting. Another five minutes go by and it becomes clear that the only people near leaving are the other two-top that's just gotten up. At this point I've lost patience and say to her that she should have pushed together the two tables to give us a spot. She kind of weakly shrugs and said ""oh well the other table started eating"" (they hadn't, and that's no excuse for the incompetence of pushing together the tables the way she did anyway). So I ask her point-blank: ""look, do you know how long the wait will be or not? Don't tell me a 'couple minutes.' Do you know or not?"" She just kind of mumbles and looks away, clearly uncomfortable and completely unequipped to deal with this situation, which was entirely of her own making. We left, and will not be returning. It's really a shame. We've been to Toast before and enjoy the food and regularly meet friends here when we're in town. Not again. I don't pay good money for brunch just so an incompetent hostess can give me irritated looks and ask me to sit at a table that's too small for my party.",-0.9632,0.809,0.087,0.104,0.44993052924087396

French toast orgy - Had three types of stuffed french toast ""logs"", so we had one of each - mascarpone, pureed strawberries, and dark chocolate. Marscarpone was by far the best, the others were just ok (chocolate slightly better than the strawberries).  Pancake orgy - Three types of pancakes, but it was hard to tell what they were. It was only lukewarm when I ate into it, and not as moist as I would have liked.  I've been to many brunch places in my life (in Chicago and outside) and nothing to write home about.

2014-08-11,2.0,"I'd been wanting to visit Toast after hearing about how great it is. But, after brunch here with a friend who insisted we just had to go to Toast, I have to say that I was not impressed. For starters, the service was severely lacking. Our waitress was neither friendly nor helpful. Maybe she was having a bad day, but she never greeted us or smiled. She approached our table, asked what we wanted, then rolled her eyes and walked away when we said we would need another minute (we had literally just been seated and hadn't even had a chance to open our menus). When we ordered our drinks, my friend asked for juice and I asked for coffee. Well, our waitress brought my friend's juice but not my coffee. I ended up having to remind her three times that I had asked for a cup of coffee. Then, when my cup was empty, she asked if I wanted a refill. I should have said no, because even though I replied that yes, I would like a refill, I never got a refill. It was very good coffee. I wish that I could have had more than one cup. Our water glasses were also never refilled.  I ordered one of the specials: peach pancakes. They sounded delightful - pancakes made with fresh peaches (I specifically asked if they were fresh and was told yes) and fresh whipped cream. Sadly, they were terrible. What I was served was a sorry stack of plain pancakes with four slices of canned peaches served on the side. I also asked for real maple syrup, knowing that it cost extra, but I was given the fake stuff (I was still charged extra, though). My friend's meal was 100 times better than mine. Her omelet and potatoes looked great, and she said they tasted fantastic. She did have to ask the table next to us if she could borrow their hot sauce, though, as our waitress brought us our check instead of the bottle of hot sauce that was requested.  Based on my experience at Toast, if I'm ever forced to go back by friends, I'll go for the savory options and steer clear of the specials.",0.9897,0.752,0.162,0.086,0.572904761904762

We found this place since we were nearby and the reviews were decent, so we gave it a shot. We were expecting the worst from a few reviews.  The restaurant looked much nicer than what we expected from the reviews. Less cramped than other places, tall ceilings, and overall a nice look. I ordered the eggs Benedict with thinly sliced prosciutto and my boyfriend ordered some pancakes with lavender, mascarpone and a small serving of fruit.  My Benedict was covered in the lemony hollandaise sauce. By covered I mean you could only see 1/10 of the muffin at the bottom. It was delicious until I had too much of it the sauce. Then the whole sauce slid off in a whole piece which left a soggy muffin. The prosciutto? I will admit the only I've had is from Costco so my standards are very low. Forget the thinly sliced prosciutto, I got some nice THICK pieces. They were also very tough and made it difficult to bite into. Trying to rip that thing with my teeth made me look like a rabid dog. I just gave up and left it on my plate.  I don't like potatoes but I was expecting similar to other cafes; small cubes of potatoes fully cooked with a few sides nice and crispy. What I got was large chucks, some falling apart from being over cooked, some still RAW in the middle. The f**k?! My boyfriends pancakes... soaked in something upon arrival. Oil? Possibly because some parts of the pancake were crispy. Um, since when do we cook pancakes to a CRISP? I think they are supposed to be nice and fluffy.

Perfectly executed, serious this place ranks as the second best crepe place I have ever been too, and I have tried A LOT. My crepe was topped with honey and thin green apple slices. Also tried my friend's mushroom and swiss crepe, very delicious and hearty, and I don't usually like salty crepes even, so I had high standards. It was not too over powering, just right. The portion of the crepe is a good size too, it comes folded into 1/4 of the size of a circle. I also ordered a watermelon soup, bad idea, it was cold, I didn't really like it.

Yes, the place is super small so if you opt for table seating be prepared to feel like the person sitting next to you is damn near sitting on your lap. The waitress we had was super nice. We were a little bit disappointed when we found out it was BYOB. Before coming to to Toast  we searched for the establishment on Yelp. Yelp said it had a full bar and served mimosas as well as Bloody Marys but when we arrived I saw on the window it said BYOB.  The Orange Juice was really good and my friend said that his Bloody Mary (which took longer to make than our food) was really spicy so I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing.

The hollandaise sauce here has a nice lemony flavor. Recently, they started serving Bow Truss coffee, which is roasted right here in Lakeview. It's strong and delicious!

Any place where breakfast food is the focus, not simply a concession offered to me if I happen to get out of bed and get my butt to the restaurant early enough-- that's a win in my book. I had the stuffed french toast here, which was extravagant and over-the-top... but I actually wish I had gotten the eggs, and not because of the caloric catastrophe I wreaked upon my digestive system.  The french toast came with one of each-- a mascarpone-filled, a strawberry-filled, and a Mexican chocolate-filled. The best was by far the Mexican chocolate-filled french toast; it had the most filling, the most flavor, and the most moisture.  The french toast are sort of strangely shaped, like big bready logs, which could be really cool but I didn't really feel like the flavor matched my hopes and expectations. The eggs being served at all the tables around me, though, looked hot and perfectly cooked and delicious.  I love the vibe here, it's super cute...

He said the house potatoes were yummy and not over seasoned.

However, the servers deftly move between tables and everyone seems to embrace the small atmosphere. Many of the menu options are simple, but very well executed. You can't go wrong with their famous french toast, but it's a LOT. I love sweet things, it's too sweet for me to have an entire meal of. I went with the smoked salmon omelet and loved it. Dill havarti, capers, red onions, and smoked salmon, this was flavorful and executed perfectly. I also loved their breakfast potatoes. The boyfriend had the french toast orgy, nom. I gladly accepted the bite(s) he offered me. He also ordered a side of their grilled chicken sausage stuffed with apple and gouda. I think I'd go back for this alone, best chicken sausage I've ever had.

A lot of items on the menu looked really good, but I couldn't pass up getting the crabby benedict. It wasn't spectacular, but was yummy.  The BF got the stuffed french toast that came with three large pieces each filled with a different filling - mexican chocolate, mascarpone, and strawberry.  The mexican chocolate and strawberry were okay, but the mascarpone one was delicious - definitely the best thing on either of our plates.  I got a mango mimosa and the BF got a beer, and our meal came to $37. The service was very slow.  I'm not sure what was going on.  I know there are only about 15 tables or so in the restaurant, but I only saw one waiter the entire time.  On the other hand, I saw 5 other employees - one hostess, two guys clearing tables, one guy making coffee and drinks, and one eating lunch at the counter.  It seemed a little bit strange since waiting for our drinks and the check took a long time (although the food did come out very quickly).

2012-12-11,4.0,"What a solid place. Yes, if you get there on a weekend around brunch time, definitely expect a wait.  The first time I tried to come to this place, it happened to be raining and people weren't leaving, so the wait, we were told, would be an hour.  I couldn't really be too upset, as I figured that it was intuitive of the hostess to think about how the weather might affect customers' behavior.  She was honest with us - a straight shooter - and I respect that.  I liked her style and I wanted to come back. Okay, hop into your Delorean, give yourself a helping of 1.21 gigawatts, and fast forward a few weeks. I went back to Toast and had such a wonderful experience that I wanted to Yelp all about it. We arrived around 12pm on a Saturday, so I expected it to be busy and it was, but not too bad. There were only two of us, so that helped speed the wait process up. When we were offered two spots at the counter about 5 minutes later, tables didn't matter.  In fact, I highly recommend sitting at the counter because we had a great time interacting with the staff and I always like being able to see what's going on in the kitchen (it says so much about a restaurant). I have to mention our server extraordinaire at the counter. If you are lucky enough to get the opportunity to meet Tyler, he will ensure that your meal is as enjoyable as he is funny. We had a great time chatting with him as he multi-tasked like a pro. WORD TO THE WISE: Try Toast's wasabi bloody mary. Don't think too hard about the ""wasabi"" part.  I am a big sushi fan and love a good hunk of wasabi when I want to clear up my sinuses, so I am familiar with the taste.  Toast's bloody mary doesn't taste like wasabi at all - it's just a good, spicy flavor that cuts through a hangover like a knife through butter. One of the best I've ever had. The food - well, the food is top notch, too. Plus, it's reasonably priced. I ordered the smoked salmon omelette and my +1 ordered the omelette lorraine. They were both delicious and perfectly done. My favorite part of that dish might have been the side of potatoes because they were fresh, and cooked to the golden brown crispiness that I crave.  Mmmmmm...starch. I needed some protein that morning and Toast definitely hooked it up, although I have to say, I had the urge to also order the french toast orgy and take it to go because it sounded so good.

2012-11-10,4.0,"I love breakfast, especially pancakes. And the only thing I love more than breakfast is brunch, and Toast serves up a great one in a casual and classy atmosphere.  I'll be honest: I was initially put off by the wait. First of all, it was very poorly organized, which was surprising to me because clearly this place gets packed on weekends and this was not the first time they have had to manage a wait. My party was small (3 people), yet we waited for about a half hour outside. Not fun. We definitely would have waited longer if we hadn't been willing to take a table at the bar. I'm never thrilled about having to eat at the bar, but the bar in Toast was cozy and comfy and had a diner feel to it so it made it a lot easier to tolerate. I'd describe the rest of the restaurant in a similar fashion: small and cozy with lots of close tables, and a slight diner vibe but with a more upscale touch.  The menu is large and varied, with a focus on eggs benedicts, pancakes, and (obviously) French toast. As a self-described pancake connoisseur, I had to try the pancake orgy (sorry, French toast namesake restaurant). The orgy consists of banana pecan, lemon poppyseed, and blueberry pancakes, but I was able to sub out the blueberry ones for the seasonal special, pumpkin pancakes. The orgy part consists of the topping: vanilla yogurt, honey, fresh fruit, and granola. When the dish arrived, I was shocked at the size of the pancakes and the amount of topping. The plate was overflowing with fresh fruit, berries, and granola with raisins and dried cranberries. Amazing! The topping itself would have made a great light breakfast. Seriously - these pancakes were a work of art, so much so that I took a photo of them. More importantly, the pancakes were fluffy, bursting with flavor, and very hearty and tasty. The real treat of the trio was the lemon poppyseed, which had a distinct lemony tartness and tasted similar to a lemon poppyseed muffin. As for service, our server was very friendly and helpful when it came to ordering, and attentive throughout the meal. He managed to keep his cool even while serving and making drinks on a busy Saturday morning, so I have to give him props for that.

Fine by me because we just walked around the gorgeous Lincoln Park neighborhood and Oz Park. The restaurant is already very small and I feel like if it were an SF restaurant, they would have squeezed in three more tables and sacrificed some seating comfort. I'm not sure if I would have preferred a slightly faster wait or the spaciousness. Service was nice and attentive. The ambiance is great for a brunch setting although maybe a little difficult to seat groups bigger than 4. I know I'll be craving those french toasts!

Had to wait about 15-20 minutes for a table for 3.  Once seated I realized the decor was quite cute and comfortable. They had cartoon pictures of toasters all over the place. The furniture was simple and comfortable. The yellow walls made it bright and cozy.  We started off with coffee and freshly squeezed juice. The juice was refreshing and not too sweet. I ordered the Tijuana scrambled egg. Most eggs are served with house potatoes and a choice of bread. My friends ordered the the pesto scramble and the grilled tenderloin Benedict. We also ordered the stuffed french toast for the table. Everything was excellent tasting. Both the scrambled eggs were delicious. They were bursting with flavors in each bite. The Tijuana peppers were not too hot.  The stuffed french toast one came in 3 fillings: puréed fresh strawberry, mascarpone and mexican chocolate. I liked the mascarpone the best. Did not thing much about the strawberry. They were big and quite filling.  Overall I really enjoyed my meal. I believe they have some outdoor seating too in the patio. The food is scrumptious.

Whenever I go out for breakfast food I am expecting, or at least hoping, for all components of the meal to be of the best quality because the actual cooking is fairly elementary as far as my usual order of eggs and bacon is concerned. How hard can it be for them to toss bacon in a pan or bread in a toaster?? It is expected that they not burn either, so what elevates certain breakfast restaurants above the rest more so lies with the quality of the ingredients than with the actual preparation of the meal.  And unfortunately at Toast this quality of ingredients was lacking. As a true bacon addict, I can attest that their bacon definitely needs some help. It was way too paper-thin and had no meat or real flavor to it at all, not to mention how it was cooked to way beyond crisp... Sadly these same bad comments go for their toast as well. I found that it was not the flavor-packed, seedy, hearty, multigrain bread I was hoping to enjoy, but rather a dull imitation of a loaf of the generic stuff from the grocery store. A true disappointment especially considering that ""toast"" is the name of this place! You'd think they pride themselves on their delicious breads with a name like that... Just when I was sure that all hope was lost, I took up a fork-full of their house potatoes and my mouth instantly watered. I crave them to this day.

He suggested the cheese was the best, but I decided to get one of each, strawberry , chocolate & ricotta. Our food came after a while, honestly, I was kind of disappointed. Slightly mooshy, lukewarm, and didnt have the custardy texture I usually like about french toast. I also expected full, fresh strawberries, oozing chocolate & fluffy cheese. I admit, the cheese was good, but nothing ro rave over. Although,I did have a bite of my friend's chicken sausage, it was boooooooomb! So much that I took the whole link. Sweet, mapley, peppery goodness with a snap. Can I buy some of that?!  Anyways, I ate half of my food and saved the leftovers, but....

Now that we drive there, ehh, not as often, but that's because Lincoln Park parking is tough. Plus, to be honest, the wait at Toast can be bad so the last thing you want to do is drive there hungry and find yourself waiting for a long-time.  Logistics aside, the food is good - better than good, even -, the service is friendly and fast, and the space is cozy. I judge a breakfast place by the quality of their eggs. Mainly because I am so damned picky about my eggs. Funny thing is some idiot once told me being picky about food was a sign of immaturity. I call her an idiot because being picky is actually a sign that you are mature enough to know how your food is supposed to be prepared. Eggs should be light and fluffy, cooked over low heat so that when they come to the table they do not bounce. Toast gives me eggs that are tender and light. Perfect. So try any of there omelets or scrambles. They will happily leave of any ingredients you don't like and they will bring to the table some mighty good eggs. Second, you must have either their pancakes, which are good, or their french toast, which is better. But most especially you have to try their french toast STUFFED with sweet mascarpone and strawberries.

The first time I went to Toast was with my mom and sis who were in town.  Because it was a Friday morning we didn't have a wait which based on other reviews is odd!  My mom had the french toast orgy and my sis had the pancake orgy - the amount of food that came out was insane!  They both enjoyed there choices and left at least half on the plate.  I'm not a fan of sweet breakfast foods (give me eggs dammit) so I had the BELT sandwich with avocado and it was amazing.  I substituted the potatoes for the fresh fruit and was pleasantly surprised when the fruit consisted of berries and not just the standard mango/cantalope mixture you get at most places. Since my original visit I have had good experiences, a couple times a bit of a wait but nothing too terrible.  My only problem is I liked the sandwich so much that I haven't tried anything else on the menu - and they have lots of items that look tasty!   I will definitely be back.  Try it out during the week and avoid any crazy wait times.",0.9131,0.799,0.13,0.071,0.5416666666666667

Nothing to complain about here, pretty standard. The side of home fries were yummy. My friend got the pancake orgy and OMG I had a bite and it was delicious. 3 different flavored pancakes (blueberry, poppy-seed, and ?) stacked with yogurt, granola, and fruit galore. My boyfriend got 3 lemon poppy-seed pancakes and I thought they tasted so sweet and delicious that you didn't even need to put syrup or anything on them. Overall everyone loved their food. I tried a little of everyone's pancakes and they are hands-down some of the best (if not THE best... seriously) pancakes I've ever had. Honestly. The lemon poppy-seed was the bomb and the overall combo of the yogurt and granola on pancakes is so clever I might start doing it at home. It tasted wonderful.

2011-10-13,5.0,"This is the best breakfast food I have had at a restaurant in Chicago. Period. Toast shines because of it's simplicity. They offer expertly cooked breakfast staples featuring fresh, delicious ingredients. I have tried the Smoked Salmon Omelette, Crabby Benedict, and the almighty Breakfast Burrito. I recommend any of these dishes, all are delicious, but to me the Burrito is easily the star. I have tried making breakfast burritos a few times, and have ordered them in a few restaurants, but no egg-based burrito has come CLOSE to how good the Breakfast Burrito is at Toast. It's a very simple dish, but everything inside (and outside) that delicious green tortilla is cooked to perfection.  I recommend getting it with Avocado, it's awesome.  Also the Grilled Chicken Sausage with Apple and Gouda is really, really, good and be ready for the huge portion they offer as a side. Actually Toast has pretty large portion sizes in general -- you would probably be fine splitting an entree with someone (but good luck deciding on one dish to order). The wait for a table can be a little long on the weekend (it's a very small restaurant). If you can find time to get there on a weekday I highly recommend doing that -- the few times I have been there on a weekday there was zero wait for a table.  The service at Toast is great -- the servers are friendly, attentive, and good at getting people in and out without making you feel rushed.

This place has always been impossible to get in on the weekends, so I figured any place that has a 3 hour waiting list on weekends is definitely a place worth checking out. We went on a Thursday and had no problem getting an immediate table.  We were seated right away and although the menu seemed to have a mile-long list of choices, I stuck with my staple breakfast of eggs Benedict. As delicious as the Crab Benedict sounded, I stuck with traditional Benedict.  And, ohmylands...hands down it was truly the BEST eggs Benedict I have ever had! And I can confidently give all the credit to the holandaise sauce. It was orgasmic---incredibly light with a hint of lemony sweetness. I could've had seconds. And thirds... my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  The service was great and the food was comparable to any brunch place. My only complaint is the lack of space and seating, so I can have that eggs Benedict again on any given weekend without waiting 3 hours!!!

If you look through my yelp review profile you might notice how fickle I am about Eggs Benedict, especially Hollandaise Sauce. Well, I'm pleased to report that I've finally struck gold. Toast's buttery, nutty, truffle oil-infused Hollandaise is, in the immortal words of Drake, ""the best I ever had"". The eggs were perfectly poached and the potatoes were crispy and richly seasoned. Cons: My guest and I were seated 2 hours after we arrived on a Sunday morning. Also, the coffee tasted bitter and cheap. It gave me a stomach ache. Coffee is really important for me, but someone else might prefer the strawberry lemonade in place of it.  I'll go back some day.",0.9804,0.728,0.213,0.059,0.7230769230769231

Major points also for the fruit - the generic melon medley, one piece of pineapple and red grape fruit salads most diners serve totally bum me out. How does that pass as a fruit salad that I have to pay extra for? Toast provides a delicious mix that includes strawberries, blueberries, bananas, grapes, melon and blackberries.  Furthermore, the service is personable and prompt, the interior inviting and the options creative (for example, PB&J pancakes) and fresh - i really have nothing more to say, other than Toast is a favorite for breakfast in a neighborhood with breakfast options galore.

Food was hot, delicious, and there were lots of options. Like usual, I won best dish between the two of us. I got the eggs benedict (my fav brunch food).

In addition to that, it's served with perfectly browned potatoes, yum! My boyfriend got one of each of the stuffed french toast. The french toast is the baked variety, not the griddled version most people associate with french toast. If you're not familiar, baked french toast is a lot more delicate and moist. Overall, his dish was just OK.  I'm giving Toast 4 stars because we got in quick (not usually the case based on other reviews), service was fast, food was tasty (especially mine), they had belini's on the menu (my fav), and the atmosphere was really great.

2011-03-11,3.0,"Toast gets 3 stars out of pure frustration. It's really damn good brunch, it's just not worth the hassle.  I finally got the chance to try Toast when my boss suggested having a breakfast meeting on a Friday. I suggested Toast because I was hopeful that there wouldn't be a 2 hour wait at 9:15am on a Friday. I was correct. The place was definitely busy and bustling, but we were able to get a table right away. Please note that I've tried to come here 3 or 4 other times during ""peak weekend"" hours, and found myself with the aforementioned 2 hour wait (which i clearly did not stick around for). I'm sorry.... there are very, very few things that are worth a 2 hour wait. Unless you have the patience of a saint, I'd steer clear of this place on the weekend (unless you're a very early riser and can beat the crowd).  The stuffed french toast was legit amazing. The mascarpone was by far my favorite; the chocolate was very good. Strawberry was a distant third place. I would most likely just order all mascarpone if I ever make it back here and don't try something else on the menu. My boss had an omlette that was quite good; but honestly the french toast/pancakes are really the shining stars on the menu. The service was definitely a little bit brusque. You'd think at a cute little brunch place like this would have the type of servers that are overly perky/nice/etc. Not the case.   If you're lucky enough to be able to hit up the brunch scene on a weekday, I'd definitely put Toast on your list of places to go. Stay away on the weekends..... there are plenty of other crazies showing up to wait for a table, you don't need to join them.",0.9941,0.795,0.176,0.03,0.4917293233082706

I care service and food; sometimes, great services transfer the impression to the food they served. As for this TOAST's BAD services, I tried to choose to be unbiased because I felt their chef did a great job! Service: I Don't Like Their Services!   Three of us were waiting for a table on a non-special weekend morning. I don't mind taking one hour waiting but the waiters/ waitresses  and the owner(a lady with glasses) did a horrible job. They don't care about what you feel. We supposed to get a table for three which may combine two two-seat tables into one. However, we were shocked they just turned a small table from a vertical into a horizontal way. It means three of us squeezed into a small table which could only fit two people. We were not pleasant about this decision they made just because they have a bigger group of 6 waiting too long. We asked them to change a bigger table for three of us and they said it may take an extra 20 minutes.(we had been waiting 1 hour for a table). After we sat, the owner came into and said, it's your last chance for requesting a bigger table. What would you do if you already sit and finished the order? Of course we set up our mind not to change, but I hate the attitude that they don't apologize they didn't have enough room for us. (You know, brunch dishes are always huge! Can you imagine a small table fits at least three big plates at the same time?) Will you feel comfortable eating in that way on a weekend morning?  Cleaners throw and clean tables in a noisy way. Why do we have to be treated like Chicago's cab drivers in a brunch restaurant? The services didn't improve since I first went in July 2010. I feel disappointed because this store still remains the low-end services. Food: *French Toast orgy is special! Three different flavors in the stuffed toast, I like the idea! It's a little bit soaked while eating but it's not bad. *Ahi Tuna sandwich, my friend ordered this. Looks very good because it's a big chunk of tuna and cooked perfectly. My friend loves this.

We get our food and 2/3 of the raspberries were moldy.  After sending the raspberries back we get a whole dish of raspberries with a superior 1:1 moldy berry ratio.  The rest of the food was fine (the only reason this place gets 2 stars), but if you are going to have poor customer service, your breakfast better blow me away for me to return. About half-way through the meal, Jill (we nicknamed her Kiki before we knew her real name), came over to our table to seemingly mend fences.  She propped up one of her legs all casual-like on the booth and proceeded to poorly explain her rudeness.  About 2 sentences in, one of her minions came up behind her and started giving her a backrub.  #1: freaking weird, and #2: gross.

The BM's were not my favorite, but good. They are wasabi-flavored and made from Toast's own mix, with red and yellow peppers on top.  Pretty spicy but a lot of people like that.  I couldn't tell if the orange juice was freshly squeezed, but I think it was.

Having dined here twice, I don't understand why this place is always so mobbed - other than the fact that it's the size of a postage stamp. The food is good, but not fantastic which in turn makes the prices feel a bit steep.  On my first visit, I had the strawberry, brown sugar and cinnamon crepes and a side of the breakfast potatoes. Honestly, I don't remember much about the crepes except to say that they were fine. What did resonate was the tastiness of the breakfast potatoes; red potatoes sautéed to perfection. On my most recent visit, I ordered blueberry pancakes and another side of potatoes. For $8 I got 3 medium sized pancakes with real blueberries in and around them (nothing accompanies the pancakes, not even a fruit garnish). Even with the blueberries, I found the pancakes to be rather bland and dense, not light and fluffy. The potatoes, of course, did not disappoint. On both visits, service was stellar; not effusively friendly, but extremely efficient. The kitchen cranks out food quickly and the bussers are extremely attentive, quickly refilling waters, coffees and clearing plates. Bottom line: The food is fine, but if I'm going to brave long waits for breakfast and drop $12 on pancakes and potatoes, the food better be orgasmic (or close to it).

The stuffed french toast were pretty good too but they were a bit soggy which made it a little less yummy, and plus i discovered in my last few bites that they were a thousand times better with honey than wth syrup, I wish i had realized that before I was practically done haha. My only complaint is the wait.  Try to go at an off time, we went on a thursday at 1 which was perfect but ive been there on saturdays and sunays after 9 and its almost always an ""hour and a half"" wait. However if you sit there most people leave before their names are called and it ends up being a lot less than an hour and a half. I'm pumped to go back next weekend and try the pancake orgy, will let you know how it tastes!",0.9862,0.755,0.199,0.046,0.4231884057971013

My boyfriend and I were the lucky patrons to be seated next to her during this awful experience.  Both of our jaws hit the floor when we saw the way the server and the manager treated Leslie's table...it was unbelievable.  The most shocking part is...after Leslie and her 2 friends left the restaurant the hostess seated another table of 3 at the table----you messed up Toast and you need to be called out for this poor customer service.  Why on earth would you turn down these people when they were willing to be very thoughtful and order for the 4th member in their party before he even arrived as to not hold up the table?!?!   We're breakfast lovers and Toast used to be a favorite but I think we'll go elsewhere out of sheer principle.,0.6512,0.851,0.095,0.054,0.6186507936507937
2010-10-17,3.0,"After several attempts to eat at Toast (and always got the ""an hour to 2 hour wait after 10:30 AM), we finally made it in at 8:30 AM. It was just my husband and I so we were seated fairly quickly. After perusing the menu for 2 minutes, I settled with the ""create your own omelet"" and my husband had the stuffed french toast.  Food - I'm not very picky when it comes to omelets as I don't think you can really screw one up. However, Toast failed my mediocre expectations. I asked for three simple ingredients to add - mushrooms, sausage, and cheddar cheese. I promise you, I think the chef took a cheddar pinwheel and just sat it right on the egg. The cheese ate my omelet! Needless to say, I enjoyed the side items - toast and potatoes. As far as my husband's meal, he seemed to enjoy it as the only thing that was left on the plate was the fruit.  Service - This place gets quite busy after 9:30 AM so arrive early if you're in the mood to try this place out. However, I have to say that this place is pretty much, ""hurry up and eat your food so we can seat the next guest."" I'm a pretty quick eater, but this place takes the cake. Before I was done eating, the waitress brought our check and the busboy took my plate.  Overall - I definitely won't be visiting this restaurant again. I felt I had a better brunch experience at Nookies Two, right across the street. Another thing, although I don't have children, I don't think this place is very accommodating for families.

2010-09-30,4.0,"Indulgent brunch-lovers, this is your go-to spot! Savory eggs benedict, rich, sweet french toast...your tastebuds will thank you for starting the day off deliciously. This morning, I took advantage of an awesome Groupon deal here ($10 for $20 worth). A friend and I arrived around 10am. No wait for a table for two, although Toast was bustling with guests by then. The first thing I noticed was the warm, inviting lighting-- peachtone walls and casual hanging lights. [Contrary to the previous review, I found the storefront to be charming-- an industrial feel with a red brickwall, and a cozy corner location.] We decided to go for halfsies on the French Toast orgy, and the Veggie Eggs Benedict. **French Toast orgy: Marscapone is genius-- a creamy, soft flavor complements the sweet maple syrup. As for the Mexican Chocolate and Strawberry-- the decadent flavors were there, but I found the consistency of the french toast to be a bit tooo soggy...I missed the nice seared texture of a solid french toast. **Veggie Eggs benedict: HANDS-DOWN one of the best benedicts I've ever tasted. The Hollandaise sauce was rich and buttery, but the spinach and chunks of artichokes provided a savory and vegetal component. The runnyness of the egg yolk was perfect-- the English muffin base soaked it right up. It was served with their house potatoes, which were hearty and cooked to a melt-in-your-mouth consistency.  Lastly, I enjoyed their house coffee very much! Toast serves Julius Meinl coffee, a gourmet Viennese roasting company. As a Peet's Coffee barista, I have befriended many a coffee bean, and I was impressed with Julius Meinl's nutty aroma and smooth finish. A mild, ease-into-the-morning cup of joe. I'd definitely venture back to Toast to try their lunch menu (croque monsieur, or ahi tuna with grilled fennel?!! SOLD.) Their prices are reasonable, for the ingredient quality, comfortable setting and decent service (excuse the following digression: their host service was not very attentive..a coffee refill once, and no ""check-in"" after meal arrived).

Here is where our experience went south.  While she was making some small talk with us, another patron, one of those LP chicks that thinks the world revolves around her (you know the type, right?) really rudely interrupted us and started going off about her boyfriend being on the way.  I gather this has something to do with their policy of not seating parties unless they are all present (which is posted right on the front door/window)!  She was pissed that this longstanding and common restaraunt policy was being applied to her.  Honestly, sometimes I just don't get how arrogant some people can be.  Anyways, the manager/owner was very soft spoken and polite with her, in the face of this girl's bitter rant.  Ultimately, to our great entertainment, this girl storms off and doesn't even pay for her drinks!  Classy.

2010-09-22,2.0,"Being a brunch hostess is not an easy task, even at a restaurant that only serves brunch. In particular, the patrons are a difficult bunch to deal with -- caffeine-deprived, groggy, odiferous. Nevertheless, if it's the task of a hostess to manage the house, she needs to manage the house, no matter how difficult the cats strolling in are to herd. I tried to eat here about a month ago, but the hostess told me that, despite the fact that I was one person and they have a counter that seats at least 6 people, I would wait ""at least an hour."" An hour for counter service? I wish she had been that hyperbolic when she told me how long I'd have to wait for my table this past weekend. ""Oh, it'll be a half an hour,"" she told me as she jotted my name down on the butcher paper. I and my dining companion walked over to Starbucks to get some caffeinated beverages and returned 20 minutes later. I walked up to her and she said, ""What's your name again?"" I replied accordingly and we sat down. 40 minutes later, we were seated. The two severe-haired ladies who put their name in immediately before mine had already received their food (while sitting at a four-top? Really?) as Zach and I pulled up to our table. Needless to say ,we were disappointed. Zach posited that she actually put my name on the roster twice -- a simple mistake, but one that is difficult to correct without seeming needy. The food was predictably delicious, but predictable all the same: sharp, savory pesto scramble with just the right amount of prosciutto; two slices of ""challah"" that lacked all evidence of being challah; perfectly sautéed new potatoes that spent just the right amount of time in the pan. Zach had three pancakes with syrup. He approved, but no tears of joy sprung from his eyes.

2010-09-20,3.0,"Toast is a unique little breakfast spot that is a definite must TRY, but not really a must RE-VISIT for me.  We got there on a busy sunday morning (brunch time) and were told we had a 45 minute wait after the hostess looked at me blankly for a few seconds which made me wonder if she was actually the hostess or just someone eating there considering when I walked in she was sitting at the bar/stool area eating.  We waited outside for a while, then ended up inside after the other parties before us got seated. There is VERY minimal seating for those waiting. I had the infamous French Toast Orgy. I was impressed, although I wasn't really clear on the ordering options so I asked for all strawberry french toast. I was served a plate with 3 rather large logs of stuffed french toast, covered with fresh fruits and berries. When we got our food (because that was when the waitress actually came back to our table after taking our order) I requested a side of potatoes because they looked REALLY good. The potatoes were on my table within seconds.  The strawberry was AMAZING. But after getting through that one log, I was a little sad to realize, I almost didn't have enough room left for the other 2. I dug my fork into log #2 only to realize that I was served all 3 flavors, instead of just strawberry. First, I tried a bite of the mexican chocolate, maybe I've never had ""mexican"" chocolate before, but jesus christ was that rich. I felt like a dog trying to get peanut butter off the roof of my mouth after that single bite. It was really good, and I'm sure chocolate lovers devour it within minutes, but I'm not much of a chocolate person so I moved on to try the mascarpone. Plain and simple, I didn't like it. It was too bland for my tastebuds. The service was... ok. What can you really expect in a small diner on a busy sunday?

So we walk in, and we are told the wait will be about 45 minutes. Not a problem, it's a nice neighborhood anyways so we walked around. Well, we come back after 45 minutes and she's like, we don't have a table ready for you. OK, the waiting area was quite small but we found a place to stand in a way that we were in no way blocking the door.  So we are standing waiting for about 10 minutes, another couple comes in and she's like, ok you guys are gonna have to wait out side because they are ahead of you on the list, you guys cant just stand by the door and she waves us out like little kids.  It was a VERY hot and humid day, however, we did not mind standing outside if we were asked nicely. So we've been waiting for about an hour at this point. While standing outside, this lady who was obviously very pissed and upset storms out of the restaurant and says, ""This is the worst place I have ever been too, I am taking my business somewhere else"".  Well, good for her, we should have done the same but did not want our groupon to go to waste.  Finally, she tells us that we can come in. Great. We go to our very small and cramped table and the waitress comes by. Now, the only reason why this review has one star is the very sweet waitress. So we order our food and it comes out. The food is bland, eggs are not cooked right, my friend's potatoes are burnt. Hmm...  Side note: About 20 minutes into our meal, a couple comes to seat at the table beside ours.  The waitress takes the order from the lady and the guy says that he already ate, so he's not ordering any food. So she tells him, it's a liability if you sit in our restaurant and don't order any food. Wow, I have never heard anything such as that at any restaurant I have ever been. Weird.   So we're done eating, we present our groupon and get the final check. The check says, you need to tip on the pre-groupon price in bold red pen. What ridiculousness is that??? First of all, there is no rule on tipping, it is recommended that a tip is given for good service. Anyways, we put down a credit card to pay for the remaining portion of the check and they refuse to take the credit card as there is a minimum amount you have to spend to use a credit card. Well, can you post your rules on the door or somewhere visible to patrons so that people know to get cash beforehand.

First our wait was over an hour, in the heat, which I understand comes with the territory of going to a hip-brunch spot on a Sunday late morning. Fine. When we were finally seated it was the last table in the back, next to the kitchen and near the bathrooms. I knew the place was tiny but didn't think it was super-tiny. Be warned, if you are the least claustrophobic and don't like sitting practically on your neighbors, or having people fall over you, this is not the place for you. It is also extremely hot inside, very uncomfortable. Not only did it feel like there was no AC on, but being seated next to the kitchen made it 10x worse. Nothing like sweating your way through your brunch. The food was so-so. The stuffed french toast was more like soaked bread with blended strawberries, the sides of potatoes were pretty skimpy (considering the price of each entree) and we've all had better eggs.  Our server was the only bright spot to our entire experience. He was WONDERFUL! Thoughtful, kind, friendly, attentive, everything you could ask for. We had no problems with him, we all loved him. But once the check came he disappeared and left us to deal with the manager.  The manager was rude and cocked an attitude with us from the very minute she saw our Groupon. First she snapped at us because she believed we wanted to split the check 4 ways, not true. Then seeing we had both cash and a credit card made her even more upset. ""We don't split payments here"" she kept rudely demanding. ""Pick one."" We asked politely but all she kept repeating was ""we don't split payments"", so diners beware. Fine, we gave her our cc and waited. When she finally returned with our updated bill and cc receipt she had, in bright red sharpie marker written all over the bill ""TOTAL FOR TIPPING!"" and underlined it 3x. I couldn't believe it. We are not new to eating out with coupons, we all know you have to tip on the original total, but to demand a tip like that was rude and uncalled for. Had it not been for our server after that little stunt she (the manager) pulled, we wouldn't have left a tip at all. Tipping is supposed to be gesture of appreciation for services rendered, it's not a requirement. So to demand us to tip on the total really turned us off. Would I go back to this Toast? Never.

The next day we tried the other toast - even worse!!  The teenage boy at the front was so rude!  My boyfriend asked, ""Is the bar seating open?"" (Meaning is it first come first serve).  The 'host' looks over at the bar and back at us and says, ""What does it look like?!""    Rude. Nobody wants attitude when all you want to do is enjoy a nice brunch. We left both days without eating.  If it weren't for the pesto eggs, I would never go back.

It was about an hour and half wait to get a seat on a very hot day so as my friend and I walked around the park for a bit, we were quite thirsty when we came back to find that our table still was not ready and so we asked for a couple of waters. The hostess said that she would get them to us, but as we watched her, clearly not busy, talking to co-workers, cleaning menus, etc. we waited in extreme thirst. Finally, around 20 mins had passed and she brought us over the drinks and said ""were you the ones who ordered water?"". Considering we were the only 2 people waiting and had nothing but sweat running down our faces, it was a pretty sure bet that yes, it was us. As we sat down, we felt rushed because they were so busy. The waitstaff was trying to take our dishes before we were finished and the check was on the table before we could finish our wasabi bloody marys (which by the way were fantastic). The bathrooms...ugh...don't get me started. First off, there was no toliet paper in the womens, and it felt like a nightmare sneaking behind a curtain to even find them. They were small, dirty, and uninviting to say the least.  On to the good stuff...the food gets an A++. No complaints here at all! The Nutella crepes were to die for!

2010-07-10,4.0,"Stopped in today to redeem our Groupon; my apologies to the regulars. 45-60 minute wait was totally worth it in the end. When you go, I suggest waiting it out at Starbucks on the corner--pretty good Lincoln Park people watching from the corner seats there. Once we finally got seated, service was quick, friendly and reasonably attentive despite the hustle necessary to keep that line out the door moving. The food came out extremely fast, much quicker than expected anyway. Drink refills probably could have been a half step quicker, but certainly forgivable.  The food was excellent and, as I said, well worth the wait. I had the Huevos with Chorizo and Cheddar while the wifey got the Mascarpone and Pine Nut Pancakes. The egg dish was a tad simple - I remember thinking to myself that I could easily make this at home - but well proportioned, mixed and cooked perfectly. Simple, but delicious and exactly what I was looking for at the time. The only other knock on the huevos is the presentation - a little slapdash with a relatively empty plate. I mean, it's mostly just scrambled eggs so there's only so much you can do, but too much white space is noticable. The side potatoes could have stood a little more seasoning in my opinion, but they were still tasty and again cooked just right (crispy on one side and soft everywhere else).  The pancakes on the other side of the table, however, were something else entirely. A wonderful mix of sweet flavors, both fruit and floral, and well contrasted textures, from soft and gooey to the, for lack of a better term, al dente bite of the cooked pine nuts. My wife called them the best pancakes she'd ever had. I can't say I necessarily agree based on the two or three bites I had, but it's not hard to imagine either. All in all, as regular weekend brunchers we'll probably head back to Toast to explore the menu a little more. Good job Groupon (and Toast!).",0.9952,0.792,0.175,0.033,0.5158156155438764

The first time we were at Toast, we sat down next to a lovely pair of women who were just finishing up.  We asked what they ordered and what they thought.  One woman got the smoked salmon omelette and recommended it.  The other got the stuffed french toast (one of each flavor available) and expressed disappointment. We proceeded to order: salmon omelette for the gentleman, huevos w/ chorizo & cheddar for the lady, and the kid's portion of the stuffed french toast (one of each flavor) to share. We make our way through our respective brunch choices and try each others, both egg dishes are yummy and hit the spot.  Word to the wise: skip the potatoes and the toast -- they're not that great and they are fillers.  You must save room for the good stuff.

Not off to a good start. The A/C was broken so it was quite warm in the tight little space, again not doing too well. No friendly apology offered. Then they refused to split the bill, which is inconvenient when dining with friends.  I had a special request and the waiter looked at me like I had many heads, then questioned why I would want what I had requested, then had to come back and clarify my simple instructions.

When we arrived the manager told us we could sit at any open table with the caveat that we could actually only sit at a two top (in a dead restaurant) because the booths were reserved for groups. That's okay, I get that. But it just went downhill from there. My friend and I had literally been sitting about 4 seconds when the waitress came over and asked if we were ready to order.

Someone teased about my choice to order the same thing every time and my response was that there are enough unpredictable things in the world; at least I could count on french toast satisfaction.  I don't even like prosciutto, but the hollandaise sauce on the eggs benedict is so good that I would try it on an old shoe. Observation: some people actually have to close their eyes after biting into this dish because if not, it might cause sensory overload. As far as the staff goes...let's just say that your experience here will likely not be duplicated. Yes, they have some rules. None so quirky that anyone should be put off though. They are actually rooted in common sense and common courtesy, i.e. don't allow your toddler to bang loud objects together, don't try to place an order while on your cell phone attempting to re-invent your business model, and don't try to wheel your stroller that is half the size of a Volkswagen through the restaurant.

2010-04-03,1.0,"Just tried to go here yesterday - hadn't been in years but I remembered that it was pretty good and we were in the neighborhood.  Well, we never made it in the door.  My mom and I stopped with my 9-month old son (in stroller, of course) and the hostess nicely informed us that it would be a 30 minute wait.  No problem, we said - but when we returned 30 minutes later, we were told we couldn't bring the stroller in.  OK, I know it's a small place and I totally get that they don't have room - but most places let you fold it and leave it in the back.  Nope - not only would they not let us do that, they suggested we lock it up outside.  We have one of those notorious, large - and expensive - strollers, my one pre-baby splurge.  It has a backet on the bottom that was filled with our recent purchases, toys, bottles, diapers, etc - I use it in lieu of a diaper bag.  So there was no way we could unload it and I didn't feel comfortable leaving it outside.   The reason I'm so ticked off is that had the hostess told us this (and she definitely saw the stroller when we put our names in), we could have put the stroller in the car when I went to feed the meter, which was parked 10 minutes away.  Then the owner or manager or whoever she is - the one everyone else is bitching about - came out and rudely told us that we couldn't bring the stroller in.  Um, yeah, thanks, we knew that.   By the time we got a table at Nookies nearby (an hour after we put our name in at Toast), my son was melting down.  I won't try that again - there are too many amazing brunch places in town to give my business to one that thinks I'm doing them a favor by wating there.",0.7921,0.805,0.105,0.091,0.50489417989418

It's cozy, cute and very warm. There are two window seats, which are hard to score, but are very romantic. I've only ever come with one other person, and I couldn't imagine coming with more than a party of 4-- it's just not a party place. 2. I love the food. I can never decide brunch or lunch when I'm there. And the toast is amazing. Drinks can get a bit price-y, but stick with mimosas and you're good.  3. I LOVE the lady Jill behind the bar. I never ever leave that place without talking with her and getting a funny story or two. She's friendly, efficient, and knows how to run the place. The rest of the staff is cute and nice, too, though. Jill is just the icing on the cake.

In a world where things are rocky & we have learned that customer service is so very important, it was a bit unreal how rude the hostess and lady manager in charge were. We were originally going to be a party of six then learned that our whole party had to be there before we were seated due to the fact, ""you order and we serve you so fast so by the time your other friend shows, you'll already be finished eating."" Umm, okay cocky waitress, but you haven't seen how SLOW I eat. Then we learned that our sixth friend went to the wrong Toast (she was at Damen - we were at Webster). We explained this to the hostess, who again, told us that we can't be seated without our whole party. (YEAH, thanks - we got that). So we make an executive decision to just sit and eat as I text our 6th friend to say that they won't seat her even if she makes it in the next 15 minutes so we'd meet up with her after the meal. She arrives maaaaaaaybe six minutes later - mind you, we hadn't even ordered and received all our drinks yet. She says she was berated by the hostess who declared that she absolutely could not sit down. I mean, really - were we being filmed for ""Boiling Point""? Do they not realize THEY were losing business by not letting her eat? I get up and speak to the lady manager on duty and she gives a different excuse than the hostess - saying that there's no room at our table (you bet there was...we were sharing a bench - we can squish). No go. Needless to say, this ruined the entire experience because more than half of the charm of a restaurant is how you're treated. We were treated like nothing and it was quite frustrating.

The big difference though (and the reason for only 2 stars) is the service. As noted by another Yelper, it sucks. The issues with service only arise when it gets crowded (which is basically after 9 AM on any given weekend). My friend lives in LP, and so we hopped around the corner to get some brunch. It was pretty crowded at about 11, so we put our name down on the list with the unfriendly hostess (who took about 5 minutes to even notice us standing in front of her). We were then herded into the corner alcove (the ""waiting area"" if you will). Unfortunately the waiting area overlaps with some seats at the bar, so you are literally standing next to people who are eating. It was freezing that day, so we didn't want to stay outside. I've had bad experience with walking around while waiting to be called and then the restaurant skips over you, so I wanted to stay to make sure we got a seat - and soon. The owner kept yelling at us to not block the doorway (which we weren't), and once we were shuffled back into the corner, we were then yelled at to not get into the bar dining area. Seriously, there is no where else to stand. Thankfully, a couple as called, revealing two seats. My friend and I sat down and had a great conversation with an ex-Pat and her niece. This conversation made the wait less painful. Once we were called, we were seated at the bar even though there was a table available. Upon looking up, I noticed this and asked the hostess if we could switch to the table. She looked annoyed and was hesitant until I verbally suggested to my friend that we should just leave. (Note: the two seats we were taken to at the bar were the same ones that overlapped with the ""waiting area""). We were then seated. Once seated, the waitstaff was okay, but our visit was pretty much ruined by the rude hostess and rude owner. If you crave Toast, go to the one in Bucktown. The parking is better, the staff is more chill, and they will let you stand inside when it is freezing cold and not make you feel like a chastized child while waiting for a table.",0.5433,0.849,0.076,0.075,0.5295698924731183

Normally I get the regular french toast but I think I'm converted to stuffed...the mascarpone was light and sweet, so it didn't feel like I was eating a heavy dish. It's also a nice treat when restaurants know how to poach an egg and don't just serve you runny eggs in a bowl. If you don't get coffee while you're waiting for a table, definitely order the coffee at Toast. It's Julius Meinl, which is some of the best coffee around.

2009-07-13,1.0,"Toast Review In my review of Over Easy Café I mention that my friends and I have tried other breakfast spots some good and some bad, well Toast is one of those places that was bad, very bad.  Location: I personally don't have a problem with the location of Toast is just that parking around there is a beast because it's in a residential/shopping area. So best bet is get there early. Street parking is possibly but you might have circle the neighborhood until you find a spot. We got there at around 10 o'clock I had to make a few passes until I found street parking. Service: If you get here at certain time you will be waiting for a less 30 to 45 minutes, but don't expect to get free coffee here while you wait like at Over Easy Café, but there is a Starbucks down the street where you can get a coffee (spend more money) while you wait.  Once we got inside and finally sat down I notice how the service didn't seem to know what was going on, the hostess was sitting people down then one minute later Jill the manager was getting on her case for sitting people at tables. It's like Jill is too busy putting on a show and putting one of the waiters business on blast for a few people to hear then to communicate with the hostess. The manager Jill who it seem like all the negative reviewer has a problem ready had a crappy attitude that day, which is sad cause she seem to embodies that whole Lincoln Park I'm better then you attitude with is silly cause 1. I'm doing you a favor by spending my money at your establishment and 2. You're not the only place that serves breakfast so get off your high horse. She even tried to snap at one of my friends that would have turned out very bad for her if my friend had paid her any mind. That little bar she hides behind wouldn't have stopped a fire up Mexican female from hopping over it and kicking the crap out of her. Atmosphere: This place was just too chaotic for me, and place is shape like a bowling lane it's so damn narrow and cramped. I was literally elbow-to-elbow with the person right next to me and I don't like that and I'm sure they didn't either. Food: I was not impressed with the food at all; the food looks like the atmosphere of the place...Rushed. My friend was shocked to find that her omelette didn't come with potatoes, my order cost less then hers and I got potatoes, so I gave her some of mine. The order I got had no presentation at all, it was like the chef slap it on plate and put it in the pass and move on to the next order. Overall: As the saying goes ""You only get one chance to make a first impression"" Toast blew that one and only chance the moment we stepped in the door and yes it's cliché to say but I will never come back to this place ever again. I would not recommend this place to anyone; the crappy service, the cramp environment and the substandard food is not worth your time let alone your money. If you're in the Lincoln Park area and you want an alternative that's 10 times better then walk a few blocks south and go to Nookies 2.",0.9803,0.753,0.149,0.098,0.490931416591794

The pesto scramble is great too, but a little pricey for something I could make at home (which this did give me the idea to put pesto in my eggs and has been a breakfast treat ever since).

It's nice when people take the time to make meals a little more personal in a big city. The pancakes were AMAZING (I tried some of my fiances) and I tried the B.E.L.T. and was very impressed.

2009-06-07,2.0,"so i have been here before and the food is good, i have no complaints regarding the food. However, I do have negative comments about the staff and the owner Jill. Its weird because the first time I came here the service was amazing. The second time I came here, the owner was intruding in conversation and was very vulgar. I was caught off guard when she started saying things to our party, I know she was trying to be funny but it was very inappropriate, she should learn manners seriously. The third time I went we had to wait for 45 minutes which was already a hassle. We had three people with us and when we finally  sat down, a family member called to say she was in the area and wanted to stop by. When she came in the male blonde host was very rude to her. He wouldn't let her sit down at our table. He came over to us and was like"" um why is she here, you said you only had three people, is she here just to say hi?"" It was very strange considering he sat us at a four person table. He never even gave her water or a menu and kept looking at our table it was so pathetic. When we were finishing up, he kept looking at us to see if we were going to leave while we were trying to relax after having to wait to eat here for almost an hour.  I'm surprised they are still in business considering the ill mannered behavior of the staff. Please, if you have a business its always customers first.",-0.879,0.827,0.069,0.104,0.5689613526570049

2009-05-21,4.0,"I must say that I was very pleased with my experience. Despite the fact that I went at peak brunch hours today, we were seated immediately (yay!). Unfortunately, I ended up in the awkward seat closest to the bathroom, so people had to squeeze past me to get to it every once in a while. Food-wise, I ordered the stuffed french toast, with one of each option (chocolate, strawberry, and mascarpone cheese). Wow to the chocolate. It tasted exactly like a chocolate souffle inside a piece of french toast. I was so excited about it. The strawberry one was my second favorite, but it was not nearly as good as the chocolate. I'm not quite sure what turned me off to it, perhaps it was just the fact that it looked like raw meat. Awkward. The mascarpone was a little heavy for me. I had to continually eat the fruit and gulp coffee in between each bite. I think it was the fact that it separated a little bit, so with the oil soaking into the bread and the cheese still being intense, it was way too rich. But more power to you if you like lusciously heavy breakfast and would love it. The coffee was great. I wouldn't expect any less from a restaurant owned by Julius Meinl. Service was that perfect in-between attentiveness. I hate having a good conversation frequently interrupted by a server, and I hate it when you can't get a refill on your drinks because your waiter refuses to return  to your table to check on you.

Sure enough we parked just in front of the restaurant and headed inside for some much needed coffee. Then the dreaded choice time arrived. See we want to indulge but without taking in the calories.....which is as rational as logic gets with girls and food. Yeah...we are lovely like that and it is fine, believe me.  We decided to do the only smart move in such a situation: split. You don't eat as much, you don't feel too guilty because someone else is sinning with you AND you get satisfied. Hehehe.... We shared the Tijuana omelette which was really tasty and deliciously spicy: jalepeno peppers, tomato dices, cilantro, green onion and great chihuahua cheese.

The real indulgence came with the sweet part of the meal: three big and fluffy pancakes whipped with mascarpone, topped with stawberries, orange segments and zests, pine nuts and drizzled with honey and lavender...mmmmm....the combination was as delicious as it sounds - but just a tiny bit on the dry side. We gulped them down in no time though so obviously that wasn't a big downer. The place is really small and was quite full even on a Thursday morning.

I mean she was walking with him, swinging him around, handing him to other waitstaff (which they are probably thinking ""why the f-k would I want to babysit this child while working?""

She's the brunch Nazi at Toast.  Go ahead and read all the negative reviews--you'll see see plenty of comments about the manager.   The 2 of us go to Toast at around 230pm, saturday.  plenty of space at that time, and the waitress tells us to sit where we want.  I wanted to sit away from the draft at the door, further inside.  All of sudden, I hear this, ""No, no, no...!""  and i see this woman pointing her 2 index fingers up and down towards the window as if she's directing traffic.  I must have seem puzzled, so she rolls her eyes at my slow comprehension and said that they are closing the back.  Understandable, i thought.  so i about to sit down at the corner booth next to the window, and then hear once again, ""no, no no!""  i look to her for more instructions.  I must sit at a smaller table, she said.  Mind you at this point 70% of the tables are empty.   Fine, we sit the the table next to the door.  I thought, whatever, there must be a good reason for this, so i keep my sweater on to shield myself from the cold, and start to read the menu.  More people walk in.  they sat anywhere they wanted.   Let me explain myself first.  I am a serious pushover.  I am usually the type the cowers when someone's rude to me, thinking that, hey, it's ok.  Everyone has days, and why make things more unpleasant than it already is?  But the more i thought about it, the more i felt that i should say something.  I've read the comments on Yelp before.  Maybe she had no idea how her words are perceived and how she might be hurting the reputation of Toast.  So after we ate, i gathered up enough courage to go talk to her.  So there she was, at the counter, with her legs propped up on the chairs, having a very loud personal conversation.  i waited patiently until she got off the phone.  I walked over, and here is the actual conversation that took place: ""Excuse me, are you the manager...?""  my voice was weak and quivering. ""Yes."" ""What is your name?"" ""Jill.""  She rolls her eyes again and sighed impatiently. ""Jill, i just wanted to tell you that i really enjoyed the food here, but i don't know if you are aware that people on the internet talk about how you treat customers and it's turning poeple off."" ""I know.""  this was accompanied by a proud, so-the-fxck-what-smile. ""And...?""  I uttered.  she must feel compelled to explain herself.  Doesn't she? ""And what?"" ""Don't you care?"" ""I DO care,""  her voice going up on decibels.  ""but it's all because people like you who come looking for it!"" Looking for it?  what is ""it""? ""Oh, yeah, guys like you hear about me, and you come looking to get it.  So i give it to you!"" I swear to god is is all verbatim.  She acutally thought i went there and spend and hour and $30 just so i can pick a fight?  Is she serious? Up to now i was keeping my voice quiet, not wanting to make a scene.  but apparently she doesn't care.   ""What are you talking about?  i just came to have brunch, and..."" ""Oh, yeah, you came looking for it and you know it!""   ""Look, all i am saying is that you are hurting the reputation of your restaurant..."" ""You are not the first one to come looking for it.  So see you later."" I was speechless.  i truly had no idea how to deal with this.  She stunned me completely.  I am not the first one to complain, and she apparently doesn't give a crap anyway!  so I left, defeated. The only thing to do, i thought to myself, is to share that horrid experience with the Yelp community.  I know i personally will not go back and be humiliated again.  Even though the food there is pretty darn good.  I feel conflicted asking my freinds not to go, since the only people hurt if the business suffers, are the cooks and waitresses and all the other folks that work with her.  All i can do is share this story, and you can decide on your own.",-0.8297,0.84,0.074,0.086,0.47829365079365077

Get there before 10am to avoid a long wait, any later than that and expect an hour to an hour and a half.  But don't worry, there's plenty to do in the area while you wait!  Give your name to the very (very!) cute greeter, and then wander down Webster, Halsted and Armitage to find really cute shops.  You can also swing by Oz Park to see the statues of the ""Wizard of"" characters. The Pesto Eggs are also a good choice.  I hope to branch out my orders, but so far I can't bring myself to get anything except the French Toast Orgy (""one of each"") because it's so amazing.  One piece stuffed with strawberry, one stuffed with marscapone, and one stufffed with chocolate (this one will make you sigh delightedly in appreciation) make for a tasty trio, all topped with yogurt and granola (so it's healthy!!) and an array of fresh, cut fruit.

We quickly passed by Oz Park where I spied the Tin Man but had to keep on walking for we were getting closer to Toast. Alas, we reached this restaurant where we were met by the big piece of bread signage. Ecstatic we had found Toast, it was like we stumbled upon an oasis in the desert. We didn't wait long at all for our table, the seats were comfy and service was fast. The French Toast Orgy can't be beat anywhere else. C'mon, french toast filled with marscapone cheese?

I WISH I were making this all up. She did not offer anything to help us mop up, and was oblivious to any damage she had done to the man's drawings -- just kept blathering on and on about her own wipe out.  She did have them move us to another table, but offered no apology and did not ask if I was okay.  Once we got there, the service was slow (they were way understaffed), the food was only okay, and our first cups of coffee were tepid. We almost left several times during the meal, but decided to stick it out.  When we were done, it took forever to get our bill, and when we got it, no deduction of any kind had been made for the incident at the other table.  To our credit, we did tip our waiter well, since none of it was his fault and he was obviously in the weeds, but we will NEVER go there again.  Phooey on Toast.",0.6277,0.861,0.074,0.065,0.4803623188405798

The seating is also a bit tight.  If you deal with all that it is definitely worth it.  I had french toast stuffed with berries that was gourmet.",0.1655,0.759,0.143,0.097,0.45714285714285713
2006-07-13,4.0,"I must confess that I've never waited for a table at Toast.  I've sat at a table and watched the lines form, but I've always had the good fortune of going at a time when no one else was. The food is good.  Clearly, or otherwise people wouldn't wait an hour for a table.  The French toast is stuffed full of goodness, and the eggs are almost always just right.   I have to admit that I wouldn't wait an hour on a hot summer day, or a cold winter one, but maybe in the spring or fall, when it's that perfect temperature outside, and all you can think of is stuffed french toast.",0.967,0.793,0.184,0.023,0.5062770562770562

(SMITs) I tell him, ""Hey ... *I'VE* been there about a half dozen times.""  He responds, ""Like I said....""  I just shake my head.  But he does have a valid argument when pressed.  It's just another overpriced coochie-coo brunch-erie.  Gimme a counter seat where you can see the guys in the funny white hats flip over your home fries over this any day.  & maybe I'll even splurge with the money I saved on a shake.  That being said, I supposed if I had to choose, Toast would be my favorite brunch spot in my neighborhood (there's another place - can't remember the name, though, & it's not in my 'hood).  But if you see my bf in here, the Cubs must've just won the World Series because Hell just froze over.",0.6808,0.825,0.106,0.069,0.49111111111111116
2006-07-03,4.0,"Toast is one of my favorite brunch spots in Chicago. It's best to go during a not so popular brunch time because this place gets crowded and you will end up waiting for over an hour. However, if you don't mind the wait or are lucky enough to get a table they have really good food.  The french toast and omelette's are so good, but my favorite is the fruit bowl with granola, yogurt and honey. The berries are so fresh and delicious!",0.97,0.732,0.248,0.02,0.6575757575757577
2006-03-10,5.0,"Can't beat Toast for breakfast, brunch, or lunch!  The service was very  friendly and quick - our waitress gave me a massage for two or three minutes while we were deciding what to order -- your results may vary, but it was pretty excellent. I had a veggie omelet, which was perfectly seasoned and full of fresh vegetables. I also ordered a side of potatoes, which were great.  They must boil the potatoes before grilling them because the texture is perfect, all the way through. My friend ordered French toast with fresh fruit, which he said were also good. Ironically the actual toast was good, but not the highlight of the meal.",0.9935,0.658,0.324,0.018,0.5714285714285714

I can't review the food but I can say that the line was long, the hostess was not that nice and I dont think the food looked good enough to wait two hours to sit down.",0.166,0.825,0.093,0.082,0.6314814814814814
2005-09-15,2.0,"Tripping over babbling Trixies is plenty of fun, but the food/wait/service don't warrant a return trip. This place was overcrowded, and while the food is imaginative, the prices are more than one should be paying to get jammed into a booth for breakfast.",0.2846,0.949,0.051,0.0,0.5
