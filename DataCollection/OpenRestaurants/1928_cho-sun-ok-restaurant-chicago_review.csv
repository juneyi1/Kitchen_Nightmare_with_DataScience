2017-08-21,4.0,"Ok I'm definitely tossing between a 4 or 5 rating.  I'm still confused, but I hope by the time I finish this review I will feel good about the rating.  I've been dying for some great Korean BBQ, so my family and I decided to drive over an hour (traffic) to come here for dinner.  I was well-prepared and came early on Saturday night.  We arrived at 4pm and found a parking spot right next to the restaurant.  There was no wait to go in and we were promptly seated.  The service was 100 times better than what I thought it could have been.  The three ladies had okay service.  They provided us everything we needed and even when we needed more of something they brought it out.  They were easy to flag down and was receptive.  They weren't friendly by all means (except for one), but it's pretty typical for Asian restaurants to be like that. The meat was soo fresh and tender!  We ordered two thin beef briskets, one thick beef brisket, soybean paste stew, and grilled squid.  The food came out relatively fast, and the cooking begun.  The meal was soo delicious compared to the other Korean BBQ places I've been to.  There was a lot of banchan on the table, and they all tasted nice.  Just like everyone said, the fried rice at the end of the icing on the cake.  It was soo delicious, and I had enough for leftovers the next day.  The grilled squid was really tender and flavorful.  The soybean paste stew was a bit salty for my liking, but it still tasted nice. And yes....the restrooms are in the kitchen.  The walk isn't pleasant, but the restroom was super clean.  I can't complain.",0.9965,0.749,0.217,0.034,0.5731646825396824

People who are giving sub par ratings are too judgmental on the service but are not realizing the absolute deliciousness of the food!  My favorite is the thinly sliced unmarinated meat (ChaDol gui). Cooking it in the stone pan and dipping it in sesame seed oil with the green onion salad seriously makes my mouth salivate just thinking about it.  Then when you think it can't get any better they make fried rice for you at the end?!?!  Oh my!!!  It's the gift that keeps on giving.,0.9362,0.796,0.161,0.043,0.6738095238095239
2017-08-15,4.0,"Beware: this place can have a significant wait because they don't take reservations. It's not uncommon for there to be a line to be seated that goes out the door. But once you're seated, you're in for a good time.  Instead of having a traditional grill like a lot of other Korean BBQ places have, you cook your meat in a stone pot that they set on each table. The best part is some dishes come with kimchi fried rice at the end, which the wait staff will cook right in front of you directly from the stone pot that still has your delicious meat juices in it from earlier. The amount of food you get for what you pay is definitely worth it. Last time we were here, we brought two bottles of wine since this place is BYOB, and they were quick to give us glasses. The side dishes here are also varied and very tasty. Because this place is so busy, sometimes the service can be a little hard to get. Wait staff run around this restaurant with a sense of urgency as they feel the pressure to get things done. However, it's usually not hard to get what you need. If you need a dish recommendation, I would suggest the jap chae -- delicious glass noodles bathed in sesame and mixed with vegetables.",0.9617,0.875,0.1,0.025,0.5217857142857142

The menu did not have an option for dolsot bibimbop which was a disappointment, the table top meat grill options looked good from what I could tell but that was not something I had ate, the banchan was also not very good and the service was super slow.

Larger groups had a longer wait.  The portion of the 2 beef dishes for grilling was worth it. $25 for a 2 person portion is a very good deal for Korean BBQ. Note many tables don't have a built in grill...they provide the stone grill on your table. I essentially did all the grilling for all of us. The unmarinated thinly sliced beef rib cooked fast and was tasty enough. the hubby didn't think either dish was flavorful except for the spicy pork dish that was brought to us prepared. Soon dubu was pretty good. the bon chan could have been more better.  The bonus treat was in the end. The staff made fried rice in the stone pot once you are done grilling the meat. We even had leftover meat and fried rice to take home which is also another thing that never happens at a Korean place because the portions are usually small and the price is high.  We didn't BYOB even though it is free. Be warned, you will smell like barbeque after leaving the restaurant.",0.9847,0.809,0.171,0.02,0.5734999999999999
2017-07-27,4.0,"I made a trip to Chicago to visit my friend for the weekend. The first day I was there, my friend took me to Cho Sun Ok! An interesting small korean restaurant run by three korean ladies! I love korean BBQ so much, where you got to cook your own protein/meat in front of us! I love this small place, where it is cute and the decors are like wood everywhere. It feels like you are somewhere, a small village in Korea! We (five of us) ordered, the beef with octopus, thin sliced beef, beef ribs (galbi), mandu (pot stickers) and a cold noodle soup! It was super good!!!! I forgot to tell you all that if you order the sliced beef (the plain one i think number 1-3 in the menu) you got a free bimbibap (Korean fried rice, sorry if i butchered the spelling). at the end! I feel like we ordered too much. 2 meats, mandu and cold noodle is enough.  I love this place so much! The only reason I gave them 5 stars because the ladies are not the nicest ladies, they were really busy. Only 3 of them and served&clean 10-12 tables.

2017-07-18,4.0,"I have to give a shout out to one of my old school korean BBQ places...I remember frequenting here all the way back in 2008 and was glad to see that they were still in business!!! It's not a charcoal grill...rather the meat is grilled on a large stone ware bowl type material.  I didn't see samgyupsal on the menu but all the different types of beef were there. We got chadol and bulgogi as well as the thicker type of beef (forgot the name) and a haemulpajeon.  The meat quality is not bad for the price and the quantity is as well.  Between five people we had three orders (a total serving 6) and we were all well fed.  One thing I would change is to change the bowl between grilling meats like they do at some establishments.  The grease burns and builds up over multiple grills and tends to ruin any subsequent food.  I understand they are very popular and they need to turn tables but a lot of the time they just dumped all the meat into the grill which kind of takes away the fun of grilling it.  Also they are byob (yay!!! And like many reviewers said there's a jewel osco close by to buy from) and there is street parking available.  I scored a spot right across the street which was not metered nor was it zoned parking.  Oh, and there's the kimchi fried rice at the end  save room for it!!  It's grilled with butter and scrumptious.  All in all, a solid k BBQ place in Chicago but certainly not the best in the country compared to LA or NYC",0.9854,0.804,0.153,0.043,0.4556878306878307
2017-07-13,4.0,"This place is great! It's admittedly pretty packed but it doesn't really interfere with the food.

Drop the hospitality and get food down your gullet y'all. Don't expect attentiveness either since our side dishes and water were not refilled but it was fine overall.  Seafood pancake: Could use more seafood, was average for its price. Bulgogi: Tender and very flavorful, complimented the side dishes. Banchan: Plentiful, average  Kimchi jiggae: It seems like they kinda skimped on the ingredients. We took the leftovers home and added noodles, tofu, etc. and it was improved.

I walked in this afternoon at around 12 with my mother.  Note that this restaurant is incredibly small, so my mother and I ended up waiting behind two groups in the door way for 5-10 minutes before we were even noticed by the two staff members which brings up another point. THIS PLACE IS VERY UNDERSTAFFED. Literally two women run everything in the dining area from taking your orders and refilling water to giving the side dishes, bringing out the orders, and cooking the meat for you if they see you unfit to do so yourself for the 8ish tables.  When I thought I had past the hardest part which was getting a table, I couldn't be more wrong. Try spending 5 minutes waving down one of the two women in hopes of getting your order written down then have utensils and napkins slammed onto your table. The redeeming two stars come from the Tofu Stew (SoonDuBu Jjigae) and Pan-Fried Dumplings (Gun Mandu) that we ordered which were delicious; however we also ordered the Beef Short Ribs (Galbi) which was a disappointing portion for $14. Literally 2 pieces cut up into 3 pieces each, I couldn't have felt more robbed.  This place is always packed all the time which is usually a good sign for restaurants, but I for sure will not be coming back again. I'm Chinese and dine in Chinatown very frequently where one frequently mentioned negative is customer service, but this was a next level experience for me.

It's a  quaint and comfortable restaurant, with very clean and quality grills.  The food is pretty good, and reasonably priced. The KBBQ meat is ordered in servings of two (around $25 each) and the other entrees (stews, noodle dishes) are usually under $10. If you plan on opting out of the KBBQ, you'll still be able to get in on the banchan they offer since that comes to every table (and free refills of course). However, it's important to note the stews come with one bowl of rice, but any extra is $2 per bowl (which they never warned us about when we went). The food is pretty great for the price and really quick! Our order of stews came out in under 10 minutes.  On the other hand, the service is poor. The waitresses are often standing around talking to each other so you have to wave them down sometimes and even then you'd still be trying your luck.

However, the side dishes are delicious, especially the potato/fruit salad and the spiced cucumbers, and you can usually ask for a couple more. Other than BBQ, some of the soup dishes are really good - such as Yuk Gae Jung and Kimchi Jjigae. Finally, my favorite dish here is definitely Japchae, which is Korean glass noodles, made from sweet potato, stir fry with beef and vegetables. Cons: No reservations.

My friend and I were hungry for an early dinner at 4:30PM. We were walking by and noticed that there was no wait, so we took the opportunity and snagged a table. Best idea of the weekend! We shared the KimChi stew with tofu and pork. I love how tofu tastes swimming in a spicy soup packed with flavor and an appropriate amount of heat. It came in a clay pot and the soup stayed warm throughout our meal. We also shared the BulGoGi cooked at the table. They must marinate the beef for a looong time. It's so tender and flavorful, every bite was amazing! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I definitely want to come back. Next time, I want to try one of the tabletop cooked meats that come with the opportunity to fry rice. Some Korean ladies near our table were packing away mounds of ChaDol-Gui and then made an amazing looking fried rice with some of the banchan dishes mixed in!

The bulgogi (our main dish) was so tender and delicious. No one came and checked on us. I noticed that one waitress in particular spent a lot of time tee-heeing with other customers who spoke Korean. We tried flagging down that waitress to get the check and she just turned and looked at us like she was disgusted and didn't even acknowledge our request. We had to flag down the 2nd waitress for our check which she brought in less than  a minute. The aggravating part was that the entire check was written in Korean with a total at the bottom. That waitress was definitely friendlier than the older lady with short hair. I'm just here in Chicago visiting, but if I ever come back to Chicago, I will definitely NOT come back to this place.

So much meat came with one order so I appreciated that.  The side dishes are extensive and you could refill them as much as you want! My favorite side dishes are the radishes, vinegar cucumbers, and the potatoes!  A great place and the best part was the end. When you're done, the servers come by and combine all your leftover side dishes into the pot with a rice making a delicious spicy fried rice. For $20 it was totally worth it and I felt stuffed.

We ordered a few things--marinated beef and octopus, veggie pancake, and a spicy seafood/tofu soup--that were so delicious!

2017-03-16,4.0,"Cho Sun Ok is a rather unique place. I have been visiting for the last four years? More or less. I went there for a lunch-dinner yesterday. I can see two sides to this place. The Korean vs American perspective on how a restaurant should be.  First off the prices are reasonable. Compared to other Asian do-it-yourself barbeque places, Cho Sun Ok the space is significantly smaller. The restaurant environment is something you would find straight out of Korea. It could be shocking for someone that has never experience this restaurant. Personally, I love Co Sun Ok's meat. We ordered KongChi-Gui, some soup I forgot what is called, and a serving ChaDol-Gui. My friend aite the KongChi-Gui, and I finished the ChaDol-Gui. (For those wondering what those two are, KongChi-Gu is two grilled saury fish and Chaldol-Gui is this unmarinated thinly sliced beef.) I'm pretty sure one of the ladies serving there thought we were odd, one person eating fish the other eating two servings of beef.  Anyways, our bill came out to be $42 for two people, which is pretty worth it in my book where other places would run the prices much higher, and leave my stomach unfulfilled. Good meat and good price. For a lot of Americans, I feel that because of this restaurant's culture, you may find this setting unwelcoming and odd. If you look past the culture food service difference, I think you'll really come to enjoy the food. This place is BYOB, so bring your favorite beer and soju to enjoy your meal. I recommend the KongChi with the sesame oil salt the give you.  I will be back for more!",0.9846,0.817,0.145,0.038,0.4765873015873015

No frills, just great food. No, they don't give as much banchan as other Korean restaurants but the ones they do give are all delicious. Other restaurants may give more banchan but the options would be mediocre. Anyway, the food is great, the price is cheap for Korean BBQ. Hate how other restaurants are way overpriced. They're the only place that does the kimchi fried rice at the end which is amazing. Only downside is the service but that's just how it is with most hole in the wall Asian restaurants.

When we arrived there were three parties waiting for a table before us and there was no waitlist or anything to put our name down on- we just stood there awkwardly with a crowd of people by the front door waiting for a table! They should definitely start using the No Wait app or something because it was SO uncomfortable standing there eyeing people down to finish eating their food so we could be seated! Once we finally got a table, we ordered chadolbaegi (beef brisket), seafood pancake, and sullungtang.The meats are priced so that if you order one order, it is big enough for two people. The prices are awesome here- beef brisket for two was ~26! Typically it is priced to be at least $16 per person. The only downside was that they do not give you any steamed egg or stew to go with the meat- which was disappointing because I love having soup with my korean bbq. The seafood pancake was disappointing- not too seafoody mostly just the flour and vegetables so I probably will not order it again. However, the side dishes were fresh and sullungtang was AMAZING- really flavorful and the meat was super tender! My boyfriend has a hard time liking Korean soups but he enjoyed this one!

These two are just enough for two people. The cha-dol comes with kimchi fried rice at the end as well.  The meat has no seasoning on it, but it is seriously amazing. The sesame oil+salt dipping sauce is really all you need. Load it up with some kimchi or some,of the other sides, and you're good to go.  The longest we've waited was...45 mins. It's a small place with not many tables, and you will likely always have a wait, but it is SO SO worth. There's no list to write your name down or anything and no reservations. You will likely have to cram yourself into the little entrance or outside until your groul is next. I feel for those who don't have any prior knowledge of how kbbq works because you will likely not find that the waitresses are of any help with your questions or wanting to exchange any conversation aside from hearing your order (barely). I always make sure I say the order quickly or else the waitress will leave even if you still want to order something else.  Trying to flag down a server for water, check, etc. is a mission in itself, but knowing this ahead of time now makes it expected and not too big of a deal given the food quality has always been satisfactory. I've been to other kbbq places that were half as good and ran...$25+ per person.

While you may not get to have all of the fun with cooking, these are TOP KNOTCH. Like some of the best Galbi I've ever had, and I've had a shitload. - Naeng Myeonn: It sounds weird - it's cold beef broth with buckwheat noodle; this isn't everyone's THING but it compliments the beef really, really well and especially refreshing in the summertime but it's all year round for our fam! - EVERYTHING ON THE MENU IS GREAT.

It's by first-come-first-serve basis, and we shared a table with a pair of friends. Everything was pretty much thrown at us thereafter. Menus and cups of water, half filled, followed by a variety of banchan, thrown onto our table.  We ordered non-marinated bulgogi, which was delicious and so worth it for the price. The kalbi, not so much. So my boyfriend and I are leisurely cooking pieces of meat as we are eating it, a few pieces at a time. A man sitting by the bar, who I can only assume is the owner, sees this, grows angry, and proceeds to bark at a lady in Korean, pointing at our table. The lady nods, walks towards us, and takes 1/3 of our uncooked meat and throws it into the stone pot to cook, never stopping to ask us if that's what we wanted. For the record, it was not. We were appalled, because we're not eating the meat fast enough, and everything is nearing overcooked status... and the woman comes back to cook the rest of the meat. I took this opportunity to ask the lady for water, and she grunted at me... but never brought it. I asked two more ladies after, to no avail. The plus is that everything is very authentic. The banchan is good, the food is good. You get a complimenty kimchi fried rice when you order KBBQ, which uses all of your remaining banchan and meats. Everything was delicious, but we really didn't know what to feel of this experience. Everything was SO rushed, I don't think we were in there for more than 45 minutes. I also didn't get my water until we asked for it along with the bill. The pricing is very good, but I don't think I'll be back. I've just never seen a set of employees hate their jobs THAT much...",0.9405,0.879,0.085,0.037,0.5372857142857141
2016-11-21,3.0,"I came here with a few friends on a Sunday night.  They don't take reservations so we had to wait about 20 minutes before getting seated.  About 3 different waitresses asked us how many people we had in our group.  Apparently no one communicates and there is no hostess. It is BYOB which is a plus. They only gave us 2 menu's even though there were 4 of us.  We were given about 3 minutes to figure out what we wanted to eat.  I placed the order since I was the guest of honor (celebrating my birthday for the 4th time that week).  The waitress barely spoke English (none of the people working there really knew English) and she got pretty annoyed with me speaking to her in English.  I basically just pointed at the items on the menu.  I saw other with kimchee fried rice but didn't see it on the menu so I asked the waitress how can I order that.  She points to a pork dish and says I have to order that.  I was so confused with why I had to order pork in order to get the fried rice because nowhere in the description does it say there is kimchee fried rice included.   We started off with mandu (the pan fried one) which was good. The bulgogi, kalbi and whatever other pork thing I ordered were all good.  By the end of the meal, the waitress drops a bowl of rice in front of me and says something I don't understand.  I assume it'll be for the fried rice so I tell my friends we shall just wait and see what happens. After the last bit of pork got cooked, the waitress came by and dumped in the rice, kimchee and whatever other ban chan was leftover.  It was good and I'm glad I managed to convey what I wanted to order.",0.8595,0.865,0.081,0.054,0.44484126984126987

Every time my friends and I come here, we would leave completely full and satisfied. One of the perks, is that Cho Sun Ok gives you a lot of side dishes for the meal. That is always a plus because a lot of Korean restaurants that I've been to around Chicago doesn't give as much side dishes as Cho Sun Ok.  If you're looking for good service, I don't think Cho Sun Ok will be of your liking. It might just be the language barrier because most of the staff have only basic English speaking skills. Also it seems very hectic and stressful to work there, so I'd cut the wait staff some slack.  When you're coming here during peak hours, you would probably have to wait a while because the restaurant is quite small and there is often a lot of people here. The lines can get so long that they have lots of people waiting outside of the restaurant.  When you're looking for parking, there is street parking available right outside of the restaurant.

Because let me tell you, I came here with two old school Yelpers. The three of us CLEANED the table. Not a mouthfull of food was left. No bean sprouts, rice, daikon, NADA.  We ate. Hard.  It was a thing of beauty. We came for the food and the company of each other. We had read the reviews and were not expecting super friendly service. What did we eat? Mul Mandu Steamed dumplings- these were normal, nothing too exciting. Good filling, stick to your ribs.  HaeMul PaJeon Korean pancakes created with seafood and scallions- Flavorful. This also worked extremely well with meat and rice. BulGoGi Sliced tender beef marinated in  a house specialty sauce. Okay, so we consumed a mass amount of this. An obscene amount. Happily. Enough to make us roll out.The house sauce did not necessarily stand out as different from past establishments visited, however, it is well balanced. Savory with some sweet. Rich. This is cooked at the table. Our designated cooker-stirrer was not quite doing it the way the staff wanted. Therefore, we were the recipients of some extra attention to ensure that we did their way.  :) BiBimBap Steamed rice mixed with beef, assorted vegetables,  and fried egg. YUP.  Could we have ordered a more American menu? Probably not. Have we had Korean BBQ before? Yes.  No regrets for a first trip. **Accessibility thoughts** As mentioned in the previous 800+ reviews, this is a very small place. If you arrive at peak time, be ready to wait. We arrived early, had a party of 3 but were seated immediately, at the only open table, a 6 top. I'm not sure if this was due to accessibility needs or not, but it was greatly appreciated. We had a place easy to access, somewhere to store equipment, chairs with backs-  no problems! As far as seating, there are some booths, some tables have chairs with backs, at least one had a stool.

I generally take Yelp reviews regarding service with a grain of salt, finding that a lot of people are more sensitive to poor service, but I would tend to agree with the group here.  There is a good range of BBQ choices on the menu and our group went with a combination of bulgogi and tripe. Before the meat is brought out, there is a huge range of sides brought out including kimchi and other pickled vegetables. I knew how to cook the meat properly, but our server gave good instructions on how long to cook the tripe specifically.

There were some I disliked, and some that were palatable, but none I would really remember or want to eat again.  Service is what hurts this place.

My friend broke her chopsticks while trying to separate the two, and we were never given another pair (she just had to eat with a spoon). At the end, I assume because they're trying to get people in and out quickly, our server dumped all of our meat onto the pan so that we could cook it and be done.

2016-08-12,3.0,"Cho Sun Ok is the real deal and you can tell.  The service and the ambiance is poor but the food shines and is some of the most authentic you'll find.   We shared the ChaDol-Gui which is non-marinated thin sliced steak with banchan ($25).  There was plenty of thin sliced meat for two people and it cooked quickly on the stone pot (precariously heated by a portable grill, legal?).  The meat was plentiful, mostly lean, and so fresh.  The real meal lies in the banchan that accompanies the BBQ though.  Fantastic, small dishes complement the meat and my favorite were the bean sprouts, the marinated onions (throw them in the pot to cook), pickled radish and of course, the kimchi!  The kimchi (both cabbage and bok choy) was stunning; it was beautifully seasoned and fermented and had an almost sweet taste, nothing too tangy or spicy.  Good banchan means legitimate Korean food.  Our banchan was not refilled or even offered and we missed out on the final fried rice service mentioned in other reviews. We also ordered the JapChae ($10) and were rewarded with a classic take on the dish.  The JapChae can easily be a satisfying meal on its own and was one of my favorite parts of the meal.  It's definitely a better compliment to the meat than the rice. Be prepared to wait, there will be a line, there are only about 12 tables in the whole place.  Also if it's hot outside then it's definitely unbearable inside, thanks to virtually no ventilation and numerous stone bowls radiating heat.  We were also treated rudely and rushed out.  The place would deserve 5 stars but the service and the ambience take so much away.  If you want authentic, this is it, but only the food is perfect.",0.9964,0.743,0.214,0.044,0.6116228070175439
2016-08-10,5.0,"This is a hole-in-the-wall to the other side of the world. Expect cultural shock if you're not familiar with the Korean food scene. From the hearty home-style dishes with an invigorating array of in-house banchan, to the pastoral decor that evokes the less-dainty true being to munch heartily, to the occupied indifference and solemn adroitness of the Korean ahjoomahs in uniform aprons braced to victual the voracious growling stomachs and drooling eyes, even to the squalid lavatorial installation through the kitchen, and, oh, not to mention the glistening almond-shaped eyes against the vast waves of black hair and roar of the mother tongue, every detail at this place shouts home for many that have walked into it. Advice for first-timers before entering that magical door: shift gear to back-packer mode or do some binge watching on some K-dramas to lighten the impact, or~ simply bring a friend who's familiar with the culture. Keep in mind that Asia is always about the food. Be prepared and it'll save you from asking huh Why WHAT?! and focus on FOOD FOOD FOOD! Authentic. Inexpensive. Bountiful. Good quality. Delicious. Banchan forms the first and foremost impression of a genuine Korean eatery. If seven dishes of banchan is already a lot for most places, Cho serves up to TEN PLUS! Since we ordered the Chadol-Gui as our main course, they also gave us the mul kimchi (water kimchi consisting of fresh cabbage and lettuce in cold brine) and scallion salad to go with it. My husband of Korean descent (that's my friend I brought!) told me that those two side dishes are common, if not a must, to have when having this type of barbecue. They are refreshing, cutting down the greasiness, as they add flavor to the meat. So good! At Cho, Chadol-Gui (first item on the BBQ list) is a heap of thinly-sliced unseasoned lean beef, enough for two people (for $24.95!), to cook in a stone skillet. The meat is of good quality that cooks fast and is a perfect choice for those that dislike fat and want some solid (tender) protein. It pairs well with every banchan. My husband (again, that friend I brought) said that when ordering this type of BBQ that cooks in this type of skillet, it's the unspoken rule not to order bibimbap because there will always be rice to fry at the end. (And how did he know that Cho uses this skillet and what to order? Well, that's what Yelp is for!) So save some meat at the end, because an ahjoomah will come by with a bowl of rice, give you an eye and a nod to make sure you're okay with it, and dump the rice and some veggies into the skillet to fry. Meat makes you drool but carbs make you smile :) While the trend in the Western world nowadays is farm-to-table, Asia has long been about watching food ""in action"" and devouring it while it's still at it, as if trying to capture the perfect timing of a flavor that's so ephemeral and yet so indelible. One reason that the ahjoomahs are so busy is that they are trying to help everyone capture that moment. Every table is sizzling and smoking but there's also a chance that every table is burning. It's a house on fire and the ahjoomahs are not only the keepers of our little kitchen but also the guardians of our tastebuds. Think of service in terms of providing (not serving) good food and you'll appreciate the ahjoomahs more.  My husband just wished that the ventilation could be a bit better and there could be more hoods installed. Smoke kept getting into his eyes while we were cooking and he said it would have been better if it were just tears of pure joy welling up in his eyes. *Cues ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"" by The Platters*",0.9962,0.86,0.119,0.021,0.5396582442500811

Make sure to dip your meat in the sesame oil with papers. Sometimes they have lettuce for you to make lettuce wrap with your meat. At the end of the grilling, they come in and make kimchi fried rice on the grill. No better how full you may be, you have to eat that because the rice will soak up all the fat from the grill and it has a phenomenal taste you don't want to skip.  There are other menu like noodles too. Service may not be great, but the food is worth the wait! So be prepare to wait in line. ALSO last customer is at 9pm.

2016-07-27,1.0,"I used to really love this place. There was some of the best Korean BBQ in Chicago here & there are plenty who will tell you the same. 3 years I've been going to Cho. It's always been a good feeling of familiarity & great local appreciation for the food & even the not so customary hospitality. But today brought forth a truth I've been denying myself for more than a year at this point. I get treated unfairly as a patron in Cho Sun Ok. Over the last 2 years I've watch the quality of the same 2 dishes we've ordered every time we dine at Cho diminish to the point of inedibility. Very little meat in our beef bulgogi while I watch other tables get served heaps of beef. Rubbery scraps of octopus cooked to a point where the concept of digestion seems simply ridiculous while other tables receive meaty cuts cooked tender. In fact, the last time I had excellent food there was when I went with a couple of my ""lighter"" friends (who were absolutely wasted by the way). That's was also the first time I had ever seen politeness from the staff. I've tried for 2 years to chalk the rudeness up to cultural differences, but I've seen time after time the complete 180 from my table versus the table next to me. I've put bad food & terrible service behind me time & time again because for whatever reason, I'd grown to love Cho Sun Ok. Tonight, one of the ladies literally added more rice to a dish my girlfriend requested her not to. She paused, looked at her & added another scoop & walked away from the table. Ignored friendly greetings & thanks, bumped my daughter & didn't excuse herself & burned our food to a crisp as she left it on the burner for 25 minutes. I turned it off because it was overcooking. I wanted to cook it myself, but she literally took the tongs out of my hand TWICE without saying a word. All this while rushing our meal. The whole time I'm watching her smile while giving attentive service to every table around mine. I'm not one to chalk things up to racism & have refused to believe it could be the case for quite some time, but today I was so blatantly disrespected I had to face it. We've paid for SEVERAL terrible meals with no complaint in Cho Sun Ok, but today I had to demand half the bill be comped. Left a 50% tip out of respect for what I used to love about this place & vow NEVER to return to again be treated terribly, be served a mess of a meal only to watch them coincidentally get the same food right on every other table.

Noting that space is tight and a queue is waiting, I immediately entrusted my experienced partner in crime to order. It was a success because the chadol gui and yukgaejang were superb. The chadol gui, thinly sliced beef without marinade, is one of their signature items. As it cooked in the stone pan, I was happily engulfed in the aromas of the meat. Cook them to a slight crisp, dunk them in the sesame oil, and bundle them with shredded scallions for the ultimate entry to meat lover's heaven. No words could be used to convey the pleasure. (Don't look at me eat either.) The yukgaejang, on the other hand, is a beef broth with brisket, vegetable, and clear noodles. It was hot and spicy, contained in a big stainless steel bowl. Just by looking at it, I realized we over-ordered because the meal also ends with using leftover chadol gui to make kimchi fried rice. Nothing beats eating freshly cooked fried rice out of a stone pot, so we asked for a container to take the soup to go and demolished the fried rice without further delay.  The whole meal was completed within 45 minutes. You eat and get out asap! This isn't the place to park your belly after a zealous meal.",0.9912,0.797,0.168,0.035,0.5679705215419502

Disclaimer:  before you get offended, I'm half Korean. To me one of the best Korean restaurants in Chicago is San Soo Gab San and one of the places in the food court at H-Mart.  Then I found this place.  I would say Cho Sun Ok at times is one of the top 4 Korean joints in town. All the meals are authentic from the bbq beef to the soups.  I love their hot stone pot that comes with every meal.  When you are done cooking your meat you can put your rice and kimchees in the hot pot to make a killer Bib bim bap.   It's byob and there is always a line out the door. This would be a 5 star review except for: -they don't cook kalbi at the table, you have to order pre-cooked -the menu has changed and they took some of the better items off -food is getting inconsistent in quality -service is even worse than usual even by Korean standards which would be fine except the quality of the food has been inconsistent and slowly dropping.  Last time I was there I asked the server for a glass of water 5 times and they took forever with my extra order of rice when I saw the server go by and talk to everyone else.  Don't mess with a Hangry Korean man and his rice or he'll cut you.  Lol The one Korean restaurant I've been that defies the bad Service unwritten rule is:  He Wa Da/Il Me Ok ...  The food is excellent and they are really friendly and responsive service wise.  I was surprised as hell. I'd recommend that place if you are ever in Morton Grove/Skokie and the aforementioned San Soo gab San which is consistent and open til 3am.   I still have fond memories of this place and will probably go back in the next 6 months when I've forgotten everything I've written in this review.  If you are bored of your current fave Korean joint and want to try something new, you won't be disappointed here",0.9882,0.783,0.152,0.065,0.5174242424242423

Cramped quarters and ads plastered on doors and walls. And people are usually lined up waiting outside. FYI, would be a tad uncomfortable for big groups because there isn't much seating. But I've gone in groups of 5-6, and it's been fine. It's the usual KBBQ ordeal, but the great thing is how filling yet non-greasy-feeling it is. (Perhaps because brisket tends to be lighter than samgyupsal and galbi?) As per traditional Korean restaurants, generous portions, banchan, and bang-for-your-buck prices: check, check, check. Favorite part is when the rice comes after all the meat is cleaned off. It's dumped on the post-chadolbaegi stone top with leftover kimchi and cooked right in front of you.

2016-05-12,3.0,"I have mixed feelings about this place.  First off, let me just say, I was SHOCKED that this place does not serve PORK for their Korean BBQ...what!?!!?  I went in asking for some pork belly (samgypsal) and I was told ""NO.""  After picking up my jaw from the floor, I ordered the sliced steak (unseasoned), seasoned steak, tofu soup and cold noodle soup for the table.  The food was pretty good, especially the unseasoned beef.  The seasoned beef was a little too sweet and saucy for my preference but was still decent.  It was nice to have the cold noodle (naengmyeon) with the hot bbq and theirs was pretty good.  The highlight of the meal for me was at the end of the meal.  First let me just preface that their bbq grills are not the open grills over charcoal that I'm used to; rather, the bbq is cooked over a large shallow pot that kind of reminds me of a paella pan.  At the end of the meal, once all your meat has been cooked, the servers will ask if you want fried rice and will proceed to cook the rice in the same pan.  All the leftover meat juices and crusty pieces get cooked into your fried rice with some veggies and then she spreads the rice out and lets it cook until the rice gets a little crispy on the bottom...DELICIOUS!   The food is pretty good but sadly the service was a bit on the rude side.  I understand that they are busy but come on now...we waited in the cold for a long time just to eat there, so a little courtesy would be appreciated.  Also, be warned, there's a serious language barrier; I don't know if anyone actually spoke fluent English in there; luckily my Korean drama has helped my ordering skills and worse case, there's always the pointing at the menu item technique.",0.9786,0.816,0.127,0.057,0.598339598997494

Not dissimilar to all the little banchan plates, I suppose. Technically it is banchan. Anyway, we also tried the spicy tofu stew, aka soon doo boo, which was actually pretty good. I would get it again, since it's nice to have a hot stew to enjoy with the meat.  A couple things that I wish for: I wish they would have a better system: take the name and # down of each party so that they don't have to stand in line.

One of servers was cooking our meat and spilled oil to my friend from the hot pot. That was just not ok! They never said thank you or show any appreciation. All they give you was rudeness!  I know you are cocky about your business but there are still some good Korean restaurants with decent service. Bye Cho Sun NOT Ok!",0.8447,0.744,0.152,0.104,0.6274305555555555
2016-02-27,1.0,"There are few occasions when anyone in their right mind would write a review non-anonymously on the internet, but after eating at Cho Sun Ok, we are so fired up with stunned rage, we feel compelled to say- our names are Richard, Julie and Levi.  That's how serious we are.  At one point during this bizarre exhibition of flat out server contempt, Richard said, earnestly, 'oh, I get it. This is a NORTH Korean BBQ restaurant.'  Once sat, literally, as we unzipped our coats, our waitress- let's call her Frank, shoved the menu in Julie's face and said, 'order.' Julie did. To her credit, she rolled with it. Short Ribs and some meat and a veggie pancake. Frank pointed her talons at Richard and Levi and said 'Two, three.' Julie sort of said, 'Yes...?' The following question on her lips: 'How many does that serve?' But it was too late, Frank was off.  Our food came out. So much food. We ate a lot of food. In ten stressful minutes. At several points, as Frank hovered (shifting from foot to foot, never resting) around the table, Levi was reminded of his obtusely abusive father.  He remembered sitting in his bedroom, afraid, longing to just be neglected. But Frank is nothing if not committed to a brand new type of terrorism: Making the patron feel bad for being...a patron. We somehow hated Frank while simultaneously needing her approval.  Our bill came out to $103.00. We don't really know why. Our guess: When Frank pointed at Richard and Levi, saying, 'two, three.', he was telling us how many servings of each dish we were ordering. Frank, you sneaky bastard. Highlight: One server had a wad of TP shoved up her nostril the whole time. Everyone was surprisingly okay with it. Or, more likely, too traumatized to raise a stink.

2016-02-22,4.0,"Cho Sun Ok, you know how to make this California boy happy! Cheap(er), delicious, authentic Korean food. All here in this small shop in Chicago! As someone who spends most of their LA life in Ktown, I knew it would be hard to find a place that could match the quality of my favorites back home. My Korean adoptee friends here in Chicago all recommended I try Cho Sun Ok to see for myself, and I can now say that this is one of my favorite Korean spots in all of the city. First off, the prices here are much more affordable than in LA. The grill top style of KBBQ is present, and prices, quantity, and quality are all very reasonable. Each time I've been here with friends from out of town, we usually order Brisket and Octopus Jap Chae to grill. On the side, we'll order a fantastic Seafood Pajeon, Sundubu, and another plate of meat if we feel it's not enough (which most of the time, it really was enough!) On each occasion, you have the Ajamma's here helping you cook in order to speed up the process (since many people are likely still waiting outside). The quality and taste of the food here though definitely rivals what I've had in LA and in Korea. The meat is good (and plentiful), the sides are plentiful, and we've never left hungry. Splitting the bill, I've never paid more than $20 a person for a fantastic meal. Oh, and did I mention that it's BYOB!? Stop by the Jewel up the street and snag yourself some wine and beer before coming inside! Why doesn't it give five stars? Perhaps it's reasons that they can't control... It's small so ventilation is difficult, and I'm really not a fan of the long wait and pestering customers eyeing you for a table as you eat. Sure, I may be guilty as charged, but I've stood in line for over an hour once, and that is not something you want to do in the Winter. I think Cho Sun Ok should really implement a policy on folks staying behind to drink, knowing that there are a lot of people waiting.

2015-12-27,4.0,"Before all the complaints start flooding up this page, let's go over the reasons why this restaurant is so successful: 1. CHEAP. MEAT. Most places charge you double the amount this restaurant does. For 2 servings (which is what the meat orders come in), it's only 24.95. That's like.. 2-3 Big Mac meals? Not to mention the surprise fried rice ending at the end with all the left over ingredients... AND all the wonderful banchan (which taste really, really good IMO). It's a big reason why most customers are broke students looking for a filling meal that gives them all the veggies, carbs and protein they'll need for the next week. 2. Location. Near Chicago, all the city colleges, hmart, and a large Korean population, this place couldn't be better located. It attracts locals and suburban kids who are already shopping at hmart or want some, again, good affordable meat. 3. Authenticity. It's a Korean BBQ, BYOB restaurant! You get the fierce Asian waitresses, the old Korean grandpa owner, the mixed population of customers (great for curious people watchers), the intimate setting, and the best part -- you walk out full and smelling like kBBQ.  But of course, like at every Korean restaurant, or busy restaurant in general, you get the following: 1. Impatient customers. Just wait, people. In order to come here and enjoy your food you gotta be chill with the people on your direct left and right because, guess what? They're waiting too! Just grab a case of beer for the wait and share some with whoevers the crankiest in line next to you. Patience and empathy, friends. That's all it takes for a good dinner. 2. Getting ignored by the waitresses. They're busy getting all the customers in and out but still averagely satisfied with their experience. The system works like this: the old grandpa owner sits in a chair near the bar and watches his customers to see what they need -- the fires too hot! Get them some water! They need some napkins! -- he's calmly looking around and telling his employees to do this and that. Is it an efficient system? No. But it's nice knowing that at least the old man is looking out for you, most of the time. LAST BUT DEFINITELY NOT LEAST... THERES NO AUTOMATIC 20% TIP LIKE ALL THE OTHER JERKFACED KOREAN RESTAURANTS UNFAIRLY CHARGE YOU. So, even if you don't like your dinner, you're not forced to pay another $15 for awful service.

2015-11-28,4.0,"It's clearly obvious that we've got our share of whining crybabies when it comes to the service. So here's a thought - they don't care about you waiting 10 minutes for a refill on your drinks, or the wait time involved in actual ordering your food. They don't care. At all. They'll get to you as soon as they can. It won't matter if you're Korean, a food critic, or the pope. Well, maybe the pope. But I highly doubt it. I think my Korean grandmother may have only the slightest of an advantage in the service. Only ever so slightly because I know she'd just yell directly across the room and ask for more beer. And she'd get it. But in the meantime, you'll have to wait while they prepare all the side dishes for nearly every table in addition to your main course(s). Because while the wait times may not be up to your typical western dining experience standards - you don't see them ever not bustling their butts all over the place preparing something. Perhaps they're understaffed given the surge of customers they get during major dining times. I've been here on both rush and off times. Doesn't seem to matter. Your experience can vary. I'm pretty sure though that they're simply understaffed given the ratio of customers to the available seating provided.  But the food? If I went back to Korea for a visit to see the ol' fam, this would fairly reflect my dining experience there as well. Delicious, filling, and oh so divine. Table top cooking all the way. Get anything, get everything. Take out boxes are available, and the price is more than justified. I offer two pieces of advice which may ease your wait time. One. Order some beer. Actually, order enough to get you through the course of your entire meal. That will in some sense prioritize your place in the tightly confined dining carousel that is Cho Sun Ok. Second, know what you want. You've got your smartphone on you, and I'm sure you've been waiting in line for who knows how long. Look at their menu and figure that shit out beforehand. As soon as they see you hesitate on what you want, they're going to move on. You've lost your chance until the next Sasquatch sighting. Your experience in service will vary without a doubt.

2015-11-28,1.0,"Overall: 0/5    I normally don't write reviews but I am shocked that this place has a line to get in. My friend and I were driving by one day and were curious about how tasty the food was.    Today, we decided to go because we were craving Korean BBQ. I am very familiar with Korean food and eat it regularly. After looking at the reviews here on Yelp, we were prepared for great food but crappy service. We waited for 45 minutes outside and were seated right by the door. A Korean lady wiped our table with a dirty washcloth in a hurry. I had to flick a piece of green onion and other crumbs (I am guessing from the seafood pancake) from my seat. In addition, the table was extremely small and clearly not suited for the amount of side dishes that came out and the burner.     We ordered Gun Mandu for appetizer and Chadol-Gui for our table-top. As the lady started cooking our meat, she left and didn't come back for 15 minutes so our meat was burnt. During that time, my friend and I were contemplating whether to cook our meat ourselves not knowing what the recipe was like. She apologized after coming back and gave us some more meat. As she started cooking, the oil started spitting everywhere but she did not seem to care. My friend was not happy finding oil stains on his pants. The lady left again after putting more meat on the burner and we then decided to watch over the meat and add ingredients ourselves.     The meat was average and very oily. The Gun Mandu dumplings tasted worse than the pre-made dumplings we had at King Spa Sauna in Niles, IL. There are better Asian pre-made dumplings in the grocery stores. Despite the service and horrible food we had so far, we were still hoping that the kimchi fried rice (made near the end of our meal) was good. It's a smart strategy to use all the leftover side dishes in the fried rice to avoid excess waste. The Korean lady came back with two bowls of white rice and an assortment of sauces to make the fried rice. The rice turned out to be just spicy and lacked other flavors.     Both of our stomaches started hurting right after the meal due to the fatty meat and the amount of oil used in their dishes. I wanted to use the restroom despite my friend pleading me not to. ""You might not want to know what is inside,"" he said. I saw the restroom sign and hesitated to walk in because it looked like a kitchen. However, one of Korean workers pointed out that the restroom was all the way in the back of the kitchen. I walked into the kitchen and tried not to look at how dirty it was. There were food scraps all over the sticky floor and the garbage bin was too close to the cooked dishes for my liking. The chefs did not seem to care that the tongs used on raw meat were then used for cooked dishes. There has to be some health code violations when this place is inspected. Cross contamination sure is one.     Clearly the dining standards here are quite low. This dining experience was horrific on every factor: cleanliness, hospitality/service, and most importantly, food. We left with hurting stomaches and a feeling of greasiness. After this experience, my friend and I walked around laughing at our dining experience. It felt like we were in a Twilight Zone because the majority of the customers around us looked like they were enjoying their food despite looking annoyed with the slow service. We kept wondering if it was just us and if this was really happening. Luckily, I saw a Korean girl who has a disgusted look on her face. Either she was disgusted by her date or this restaurant; I am hoping the latter.     I wonder what this restaurant's appeal is: the many tiny side dishes, the immersion into Korean culture, etc. Either way, there is always a line and I am not sure why. I don't consider myself a foodie but I know there are better Korean BBQ places in the Chicagoland area.",0.9771,0.761,0.133,0.106,0.466484016893853
2015-11-24,4.0,"I get it that this place is a bare bones, authentic, korean bbq joint that isn't focused on service. But last time i was there, I literally had to ask a waitress three times for water before actually getting some. This was after having to vigorously flag down the waitress, who purposely tries to ignore you. Even with the crap service,  I still keep coming back because the food is so solid. The table comes stocked with an assortment of korean pickled vegetables. Then you order a selection of raw meats for the table and cook them up on your own. I recommend ordering one of the first 3 meats on the menu because they come with tabletop kimchi fried rice service at the end of the meal.   I usually go with a group of about 4 people and order 1-2 meats depending on how hungry we are. Then we get some sides like the seafood pancake or the spicy kimchi jjigae. The seafood pancake is this crispy savory pancake with green onions and assorted seafood (i.e., squid, shrimp, octopus) in it.

Regarding service, each and every time I have been greeted and sat we are treated like its a major inconvenience we set foot in their establishment.  We have waited at least 10 minutes each time to get a menu and then I have to ask for water.  Not only that, we were never checked on nor was our water ever refilled.  I normally wouldn't care, but when you're eating a spicy soup water is pretty necessary.

I am certainly not guilty free, since I come from NYC and there is an abundance of Korean restaurants -whether it's the big, two level, nicely decorated ones, or the small, 5 tables, mom and pop ones.  I think Cho Sun Ok deserves 5 stars for its food quality and service speed. The food is just spectacular, the type that makes you pause for a sec when you eat it and then go ""wow!"" My partner and I always get the Korean BBQ (the unmarinted sliced beef coz for the kimchi fried rice at the end), seafood pancake, and seafood soondubu (which are both amazing!)  Yes, the wait is long, but that's because the restaurant is small and its popularity is huge.  As for service, from my experiences, there are only 3 or 4 middle aged women there who speak little English running the entire show. They just want to get things done. Get your food out, you eat, and you go. Yes, they will miss things here and there but that's because there's only 3 or 4 of them in a bustling environment where they need to move between tables to cook, get your other hot foods out, seat you, clean up, and manage the crowd. And they're probably doing this for at least 7 hours straight. I've never had any problems with the waitresses and I am not Korean, and I've never been there with Koreans.

Nothing happened for 10 minutes. So I walked over to a server asking to be seated. She seemed extremely aggravated that we were there towards the end of the night. She seats us quickly, hands us a menu and tells us to order RIGHT NOW because kitchen is closing soon. There was a little over an hour left before you close. Why is the kitchen closing while there are still people here? We ordered on the spot. Our food comes out less than five minutes later. It was an average meal.

She let two Korean groups that came minutes after us in first. Ok, that's not too bad. Then they forgot to give water to the Chinese girl in our party, and when asked for some when our first dishes arrived, she rolled her eyes, muttered , and then walked away. She never got her water. Never mind that half of us grew up around mostly Koreans, you don't even have to understand what she's saying to know you're being insulted, and she definitely did. We had our issues when ordering too. The Singaporean with us wasn't allowed to order the dish he wanted, with the Korean lady telling him that it would be too difficult for ""you people"" to eat.

2015-10-25,4.0,"Seinfeld's Soup Nazi, but with a Korean twist. The queue for Cho Sun OK is first come - first serve.  Quite the experience on a Saturday evening, as my party of three were already #2 in line. The most notable part being that one of the patrons holding the door (and letting all the cold Chicago blow in) was smacked on the booty by the waitresses to close the door. I can confirm that the service here is as if you had a traditional Asian, tiger mom. Other than the service, I am awarding this restaurant the five stars it deserves, but it loses 1 star for comfort. And I might be too generous, considering that: the guests are confined to tight-spaces (not for the claustrophobic), the waitresses will bump into endlessly, and the waitresses will badger you for your poor cooking skills. Feels just at home, mom!  The Korean-style BBQ is definitely very well-worth the wait, since heaps of thinly sliced beef is provided and followed with kimchi fried rice. The sauce on the Korean oyster appetizers were so delicious with a blend of Korean spices and some Asian pear to relieve your palette. The Kalbi that we ordered was just so-so. The banchan were very appetizing and typical in these restaurants, but I really enjoyed the potato salad with sweet slices of red apple. We were not served rice or lettuce, but I can live without those.  Best of all is its location, free parking, Half Acre close by, and BYOB.

My friend and I ordered the bulgogi - marinated beef and for an appetizer the Mandu - steamed dumplings. The service is quick and efficient, not the most personable because there is a slight language barrier, but that's ok. First to come out is the assortment of banchan - small dishes, steamed dumplings and moments later our marinated beef and and two bowls of steamed white rice. Our server started the cooking process and from there we were self-sufficient. One order of protein is plenty of food for two people. The bulgogi was sliced thin and the marinade was great, subtle saltiness and sweetness. The steamed dumplings were fantastic and I would definitely recommend ordering for an appetizer.

Also, tips aren't necessary given or wanted. CSO is a Korean restaurant serving primarily Korean patron who understand this.

I rarely use yelp to unload my rage, but my experience here was just so ridiculous that I feel like I need to document it somewhere.... Continue reading if you'd like to be entertained. This past weekend, I visited Chitown for my little sister's graduation.  What was supposed to be a monumental moment and a joyous occasion turned into a disaster because of this place.  We drove out 20-30 minutes out from Evanston and were greeted with a line out the door - that's fine, you're popular. I'll take it.  My mom went in to put our name down, but the waitresses (all 3 of them SEPARATELY) told her: ""We don't take names down.  We know the order of who came first.""  We all thought, ""oh, weird.  I guess that's how they do in chicago.""  She told us 15 minutes so we waited outside patiently even though the wait turned out to be much longer than 15 minutes.  I saw a minivan pull up and a large party of 11 began to wait outside with us.  I saw the ladies of the group tagteaming and bugging the waitresses inside.  I knew it was going to happen.... BUT I tried to give them benefit of the doubt.  Thirty minutes later, it happened.  The party of 11 got seated before us, a party of 7. My mom went in to tell the waitresses that we came first when one of the ladies in the party of 11 started pointing her finger in my mom's face (what a delight she was...) and yelling that they got there first.  We looked to the waitress for backup and she said, ""oh, we don't know the order.  you guys should know who came first."" oh HAIL NAH.   Long story short, we threw a fit, showed them what hangry looked like and left.  I'm so thankful for the one honest man in that party who spoke up and said, ""No, I saw them waiting before we got here."" The lady who was yelling at my mom immediately got quiet and had nothing to say. I don't doubt the food here is awesome.  I was drooling watching people eat while I waited 30 minutes outside their front door, HOWEVER, let me be a diva for a sec... I don't tolerate this kind of service and at that moment, didn't think they deserved our business, which is why we left without eating.  I don't think anyone NOR anyone's mom should be treated in this manner, but you do you booboo.  You do you. PS. If you want 1 useful tip that I picked up while waiting there: parties of 4 or smaller get seated much faster because they have different seating areas for smaller groups.  That's all I got for ya.",0.9967,0.787,0.168,0.045,0.4317031317031318

Once we sat at the table, we had no idea what was going on. The waitress who spoke broken English pointed at a few different menu items, which we followed (besides those that had seafood included). The steak was to die for. Except for the fact that we didn't realize we weren't grilling it fast enough. The sides were...good? Interesting? We didn't know what any of it was. We asked multiple times...and received broken English responses with fingers quickly pointed towards pans or menu items. So was that bean jello or onion? Water chestnut tofu jelly maybe? The noodle dish was good. Spicy maybe? Bland? No idea. The noodles were transparent. I don't even know if beef was included. We brought two bottles of wine. We were rushed out before we could have comfortably drank both. Except there was no line. We could have waited. Oops. The service was nice, if not overly watchful. They never refilled water, put meat on the griddle without asking, or explained anything enough for us that were uninitiated to understand. It's okay.

The wait was long, the service was below average, I had no idea what I ordered and yet...I'm beyond happy with the dinner choice. It was fun. I didn't know what I ate.

2015-04-26,3.0,"Very authentic. Down to the ""unique"" service that you would expect at a restaurant if you were actually in a BBQ place in Korea.  The food is definitely authentic and tasty. But I can see how the service at this place can really put off some people. The servers here are all older Korean women. They will tell you where to sit, put menus down, and ask you to order, without much more conversation than that. But in Asian countries it pretty much like this. Americans are used to amazing service and consider that a  big part of their meal. I am part Korean and I know that I don't look necessarily Korean and went with a white guy so to be honest I think they were a little racist to us. Other reviews I've read said they don't bring certain items to the table if you don't look Korea. Which is what happened to us.  We ordered the thinly sliced beef #1 on the BBQ menu. It is supposed to come with dipping sauce and onions. I saw other tables get this and this dish really should not be served without the dipping sauce. I should have spoken up but it is so hard to get these waitresses attention. It was frustrating. So I have mixed feelings about this place. I would go again because I know what to ask for this time. But this place might be better to go with someone who is Korean or at least familiar with Korean culture/cuisine. After your meat is all cooked if you order one of the listed #1-3 BBQ items. You will get kimchi stir fry at the end of your meal. It is yummy and made for a tasty midnight snack after a night of bar hopping.   The yuekaejang is what you would expect. I enjoyed it very much! I got the $4 small portion and it was more than plenty for one person in conjunction with the BBQ. Also got the rice cake soup which is nice for someone who doesn't like spicy foods as much. This is a mild soup with chewy rice cakes and egg.  If you bring cute Asians kids they will give them free candy. I guess the one nice thing is that they did give us each a piece of gum at the end. Maybe we looked cute too, for adults. haha.",0.9916,0.855,0.121,0.024,0.5404684475416182

2015-04-25,4.0,"One of the best places to get korean bbq in Chicago. I would definitely say to try to come here with a Korean friend though; the service is better that way (still not great. but its better).  The meat is pretty high quality for kbbq and the banchan (side dishes) and other dishes are good as well. I would say you should get the Cha Dol Gui for sure and the bulgogi if you have enough people to get more meat. I like how they also do fried rice after youve finished the meat. So if you think the meat isn't enough food, the rice will definitely fill you up. Sadly, they do not add more banchan. I've also gotten the seafood pancake (pal jeon); its a huge portion and very well made.  The soondubu jigae is very traditional and has just correct amount of spiciness. I'm always complaining that many other places don't have the soup spicy enough but Cho Sun Ok makes it the way I like it. If you're looking for good service, this is not the place.

They throw all your meat on the grill instead of allowing you to take your time eating. The service can be pretty bad too, but then again, it's a Korean restaurant so what do you expect! Another negative is that you have to wait in line to get in, you can't just put your name on a list and wait for them to call your name.

My favorite meal to order is the "" non marinaded steak"" because it comes with soy bean paste dip for the meat, and at the end of the meal the waitress will cook up some kimchee fried rice with the left over side dishes. It is very delicious way to end Korean bbq. They make great tradition favorite dishes like chap jae ( sweet potato noodles) and mandoo ( Korean pan fried dumplings) they are a hit every time we go there to eat.

The second time was yesterday and I went for the beef on stone pan. First, I waited for more than an hour OUTSIDE with freezing wind. Second, the service is really poor. They kind of push to order, push to cook and maybe push for leave then the others can sit and order. I would say that's fine if I enjoy the taste. Again, it is simply at par. Sorry. But my home made BBQ beef with BBQ sauce I bought from hmart is way better than this. Maybe I should open another one nearby.

I wanted to write about my last time I was there because it was such terrible service.  We got the Korean pancake and it was soggy.  We got the yeuk ge jang and that was okay.  But the worst part is the meat.  We wanted to get the K-BBQ experience and cook it at our table.  We also ordered the meat where they make your kimchee rice at the end, but could not find anyone to come make rice for us.  I finally was able to find someone who came over (with a lot of attitude), and they threw the ingredients in and walked off without actually giving us rice.  So the kimchee juices were non-existent (and extremely burnt) by the time they came back with the rice.  Our rice tasted extremely burnt.  And then we couldn't flag down anyone to turn off the fire (we were sitting at one with the burner attached to the table), so we were sweating.  We finally just had to figure it out ourselves because there were no waitresses in sight. Also, as a feminist, it sucks to watch the man sitting while watching Korean shows and barking out orders while the women run around like crazy.  I grew up in a Korean household, so I get it...but it just doesn't seem right, especially since they are usually extremely under staffed.   I took some friends who had been wanting to try out Cho Sun Ok for a long time, and I was straight up embarrased that I took them.  I don't think I will ever be able to go back again.

2015-02-14,5.0,"First off, I always leave my jacket in the car when I eat here because the enclosed space will naturally leave you smelling like a mixed bag of cooked meats. Second, the wait times can get long due to the fact that a) there is limited seating and b) tables are not getting turned over fast enough. There are usually 2 servers who pretty much race around to serve the entire restaurant. Therefore, the service can be spotty at times, but they try their best to work efficiently. Part of that means trying to turn tables over quickly (feeling rushed?), so that wait times can be shortened. With that being said, it's best to have your order ready when the server comes around. They are not really looking to answer all your questions about the various items on the menu, so be aware.  Without question, the go to item here is the Chadolbaegi (thinly sliced beef brisket). The minimum order is 2 servings, so I would recommend ordering based on the number of people (ie. 3 people = 3 servings). The Chadolbaegi and accompanying side dishes are about the best that you can get in Chicago and that is why patrons are willing to wait. The meat does cook fairly quickly on the stone skillet, so you'll want to monitor as you're enjoying your meal. Once cooked, the meat is dripping with goodness and I usually dip it in the sesame oil/salt/pepper sauce that is provided and eat alongside the marinated green onions. As you near the home stretch of meat cooking, the server will come and dump a bowl of rice and kimchi to make a fried rice that will top off your meal. I like to save some pieces of meat to add back into the fried rice. At this point, I'm fully satisfied and my stomach is about to explode! Oh yes, don't forget, it is BYOB, which means less time spent trying to track down the server for a water refill!    Overall, since GOOD Korean food is hard to come by in the Chicago area, when you find a spot like Cho Sun Ok, you figure out a way to eat there.

You WILL feel rushed, so if you're not into that, and you're looking to catch up with an old friend and take your time, this is not the place for that.

When that never happened, we said, OK, guess we're on our own here, and started putting the meat and garlic and onions in the pot... A few minutes later our server came over with a bewildered look, and a quiet ""What are you doing No No No"" monologue under he breath as she took what we had in the pot out, and, very minimally/""sort-of"" indicated that ALL the meat goes in first, then she will make the kimchi fried rice with several of the small dishes after the meat is cooked. This was never actually articulated, I just put it together after I saw what she did.  Not sure why she was so disappointed, after all, she lit a pot and left raw food on our table with any words and walked away.. we are a couple of white people.. we might need a little guidance here.

I would have preferred the marinated beef (bulgogi) but they don't do the fried rice with that, and the fried rice is worth trying. They cooked the beef for us at our table, then dumped in a bunch of kimchi and rice with a bit of beef and the juices in the stone pot. The fried rice made a great lunch the next day. The scallion pancake was stuffed with stuff. They gave us lots of sides, but this wasn't my favorite set; for instance, it was missing the glass noodles I've had at other Korean places.

We were missing some of the sides that other tables had but we never had a chance to ask why didn't we get that. The only time a waitress approached our table was when they were rushing us out and she grabbed our plate of thinly sliced meat and dumped it in our stone sauteed pan and said I needed to cook it all at once. I on the other hand was searing small amounts of meat to get a better flavor. Now I had a pot of boiled meat in juices. I guess I was taking to long. When we were ready to pay we waited again so I just got up and approached a man who I think was the owner and paid. oh yea the other highlight was the Korean pancake.

2015-01-11,5.0,"I really like Korean BBQ, but after coming to Cho Sun Ok, I feel like this is the first time I've truly had fantastic Korean BBQ.  My husband and I came here with a friend of his and his girlfriend. We were thinking about hitting up a place in the suburbs but they didn't do the BBQ at the table that day. So we made our trek into the city on a Monday evening. First note is that this place is very small and there was a line out the door to wait for a table. So this isn't going to be a quick in and out dinner. After about 30 minutes or so, we got a table. I felt like our experience was probably better because a member of our party was Korean and could speak to the waitress efficiently and ask questions. She ordered all of the food for us and I trusted we'd be getting good stuff. First up was all of the different kimchi, and they were really good. I think my favorite was a potato dish. Then came the seafood pancake. I should note, I'm not much of a seafood person. I was also especially hesitant when I heard there was octopus in the pancake. But hey, I'll try anything once. If I hated it, I could coat my mouth with more delicious kimchi. But surprisingly, I loved the pancake. Whatever they're doing is really great and I could eat the whole gigantic thing myself. Next up were the meats. We got the unseasoned beef and the bulgogi. Two options for the meats were to either add green onions and a spicy concoction, or you could dip them in this sesame oil that had salt and pepper in it. I prefered the sesame oil. The meat was lightly seasoned and the sesame oil made it taste crazy delicious. I definitely need to try this new technique at home. Then, when we were all about to burst from being too full, the waitress came by and put all of the leftover kimchi and other items into the BBQ and added rice to make a kimchi fried rice. It was amazing. I especially loved the burnt parts on the edges. I even had some fried rice to take home with me. All in all, the food was over the top fantastic. We will definitely be back at some point when we know we aren't in any hurry and I'll probably end up ordering the same exact thing we got last time because it was so good.",0.9985,0.759,0.216,0.024,0.5369541569541569

While it is OK that neither of these items were on the menu, it was not OK that the owners of the restaurant had ordered these two items from an outside restaurant to eat on their lunch break at the table next to me!

I just moved to Chicago 6 months ago and want to try out all the different villages ethnic places in town. My friend suggested we go try out this place, she had never been but her friend who is Korean said this place is good. We NEVER made it inside this restaurant. And I don't EVER plan on going inside. In below freezing weather, at 2:30PM on a Saturday afternoon, there was a line, it was outside of their door. Ok that is fine but can I at least go inside and see how long the wait time is? Once I opened the door some shameless Korean woman gave me a snare and said ""Can you close the door?"". This was BEYOND rude, inconsiderate and selfish. This is NOT her restaurant, no one else said anything, and I am just like her, a customer here and I have as much right as her. I am not hurting her in any way, but she was just being selfish, doesn't care if there were people standing outside freezing but could not talk to anyone who actually works at the restaurant. After that incident, I have NO DESIRE to eat there. This tells me that is the kind of people who come and eat here and likely a reflection of the service at this restaurant because likely only rude people would not be bothered by rude service. Reading from the reviews on this page, it seems like the service inside is just as rude as the people. I have more respect for myself than bother being here.  This is beyond a Korean culture thing.

The pronunciation is Cho son oh. also, the faster you say it the more accurate it sounds. First off, this place is tiny. They have about 10 tables in the restaurant. Also do not go with a party bigger than 6. We went with 10 people and had to be split up. Which was fine with us. This place is BYOB so pack up the booze and if you forgot, the CVS down the street has alcohol [walkable ~4 minutes southeast on Lincoln].   I did not do any of the ordering but we basically got the thinly sliced beef. It comes with soooo many pieces. It is very good. We wanted to order pork but they told us it had to be cooked in the back for some reason.  Anyway, my favorite part about this place is the banchan. WOW. It is sooooo good. They fish cakes are amazing. Like something i've never had before. The kimchi is delicious and you can tell it's how made. We put the kimchi on the hot plate with the beef.... HEAVEN. The warmed up kimchi is so amazing. So definitely try that. Honestly there is not much more to stay about it. The service is decent like any asian place.

I asked for plain noodles, she said no, but suggested a dish - JapChae as plain noodles were unavailable.  After I saw another table with plain rice I asked again - the server seemed annoyed, but then finally brought a side of plain rice to the table.

The server said ""oh look, it's crispy"" and smiled and served it to us as if she had specially cooked it that way.

2014-11-19,5.0,"Cho Sun Ok is probably one of the best Korean bbq places in the Chicago area if you don't feel like spending a fortune for meat (meat-lovers - this place is for you).   The banchan dishes are fairly regular. A couple of favorites are the potato salad with apples, fish cake, and the seaweed. As far as appetizers go - order the fried mandu which is basically THE BEST appetizer on the menu served at an incredible price which you won't find anywhere else. It's an awesome steal! Main course - I'm a big proponent of the #1 thin-sliced beef. They bring a giant pile of meat which you can grill yourself. One order can pretty easily feed 2.5 people so order accordingly. I also absolutely love the fried rice at the end of the meal. It's amazing how they can make it so quickly and yet have it taste so homey and delicious. Oddly enough, the fried rice stuck at the bottom towards the very end is weirdly good too so don't let it go to waste! (Clearly I was only a little hungry when I came).  Basically if you come prepared for the probably not-so-good service, Cho Sun Ok is the best deal for Korean BBQ in Chicago. Come during off-hours, either a late lunch or an early dinner, to avoid the rush and your service may be slightly better. If you want a place with a better ambiance and service, I would recommend Gogi instead which is slightly further up north (but it's also much pricier).",0.9918,0.754,0.195,0.051,0.5492555831265509

We had a table of 3, were sat within 3-4 minutes after they cleared a table. We ordered fairly quickly - galbi, soondubu jigae, and seafood pajun. While we were waiting for our banchan, we saw 3 other groups come in, be seated, eventually order, and then receive their banchan from the same waitress who took our order. Two of the groups were caucasian, one was asian. We wondered why there was such a long delay for our banchan and asked the waitress if ours was coming soon. She brought it in a few minutes. Overall, it probably took us about 5-10 minutes longer to get our banchan than it did the other 3 groups. All right, whatever. Maybe she forgot our table, which happens, or maybe she purposely served white people first because they tend to tip more than asian americans. I get it, really. We got our food in decent time and started eating. The soondubu was really nice, galbi had approx. the right flavor, but was rather tough, and the seafood pajun was disappointing. It was not crisp at all, more moist and soft, and the batter left a lot to be desired. I love pajun, but only if it's stuffed with a big helping of seafood, if the batter itself is delicious, and if it's fried so that it's golden and crispy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside. We asked for water nicely. Then I asked for a refill of 2 specific banchan dishes. While I was asking for the refill of the banchan, the waitress stared at me, started walking away. I said ""Sorry! Can I have - "" but no, she was already gone. I'm pretty shy and I don't consider myself bitchy when I ask for things in restaurants, so I was very shocked that she just walked off while I was nicely asking her for water and banchan. My friend flagged down another waitress and asked for the two banchan dishes. We never got our water for the rest of the meal, nor did we get our banchan. I understand that when it gets busy, as a waitress, you start forgetting things, but I try my best when I'm serving to make everyone as happy as possible.

I was a bit skeptical since I am used to true Korean bbq in LA  but after a bit of searching this joint popped up on the map. A bit far up on the brown line but we made the journey out there for an early dinner and arrived at the spot around 6:15 on a Friday.  There was no line which made sense given how early it was so we were promptly seated. This place does pack up quickly post 6:30 so plan accordingly. This joint is relatively small so it quickly fills up. As everyone else mentions it is in fact a BYOB so bring the Soju from home and save on the overpriced bottles at the restaurant . We decided to of course go with the Brisket (automatic two portions). TIP: You can actually ask for a single serving of a meat dish apparently after discussing with the waitress and order 1 serving of multiple items in case you don't want to be stuck with too much of one thing! The brisket came out and I was immediately surprised. They gave a TON of meat here for a very good price I felt especially for two people. The marbling was good on this one but I could see some inconsistency from the other plates coming out but no complaints since our portion was solid. Cooked well and just delish We wanted to try a few others so we ordered the bulgogi but that was a miss for me and a bit too sweet for me.  The fried rice at the end was good also but probably not the best ive had. One thing to note about the service here... yes it seems spotty but I think it has to do with the owner maybe? There seemed to be a visual optic of ""rule with iron fist"" that seemed to motivate the workers so I think they are just working to be efficient as possible.

But I've come to expect that as part of the overall experience. After all it's the same 2-3 Korean ladies serving the entire restaurant every time I'm there.  Cha Dol is the thing to order. It's super thin, cooks quickly, is perfectly fatty and tastes incredibly good in just the sesame oil/salt/pepper dipping sauce they give you. The seafood pancake has great flavor and thickness to it, but it's more of a green onion pancake with little bits of seafood in it.  To finish the meal, they make kimchi fried rice in your stone skillet. One time they let it sit for too long and completely burnt it. We knew it was burnt, but didn't want to mix it because they might yell at us like last time. Also, an OG Korean lady at the next table straight up stole one of our chopsticks without hesitation right after we sat down. This place is awesome.",0.9811,0.824,0.155,0.021,0.4762198706643152

I tried to asked for more banchan and the servers brought only kimchi out and she did not seem like she wanted to served us.  They tried to rushed us out even we had not finished with out food.  What a bad place!

Old dude with the Hawaiian shirt and that tiny ass figaro chain watching TV while sippin on Crown. That wash station u gotta jump thru to get to the toilet. The busted ass parking lot u gotta fight for out back on Sundays.  What's different is there's white folks dining here now. On they own accord. Back then when we saw white folks there, they were with some Koreans and the gossip on the table was they probably someone they owe money too or they doing business. But now, esp with the golden age of Korean food on the American food stage, they there to try out some new shit! Big ups yourselves white folks! I imagine they experience here is akin to how our immigrant parents was intimidated and intrigued by the food when they first landed in the states way back when. So I guess it's nice to see a full circle come around where the act of assimilation, at least with food, has now shifted.  Cha Dol is all I do there now.

It took 17 minutes for the staff to acknowledge my family's existence. This annoyed me to extreme amounts and had me starting my meal hangry (for those less savvy, hangry = hungry + angry) :) When we finally got seated, I was greeted by a friendly grease puddle that I unfortunately placed my arm in and I found I chose the chair with gum or glue-like substance on it. I think I had about 20 seconds to look at the menu before I was approached and asked what I would like to eat. So I had my family order as to not having a chance to look at the menu. ******fast forward to when the food comes out 5 minutes later (wow, omg, that's fast service!!!)******* They cook for you, mix up the food, and even distribute it amongst the group evenly. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they even wiped your own sweat and tears for you. Sounds great right? Wrong. It's horrible. Apparently, if you seem remotely anything other than Korean they do everything for you. They cook massive amounts of meat for you, choose the speed in which you would like to eat, and even decide what you feel like eating and whether or not you have a preference of spice, salt or even over indulging in the same taste until it's gone. During the whole meal I looked around and every full Korean table was cooking themselves at their own pace. Amazing!!! Now that I've said ""a little"" about the service on to the food! We ordered the bulgogi for two and octopus with vegetables for two since  there were four of us. Ban chan was good and filled with variety. Just a tad spread out on the table so I tasted maybe 75% of them. Round 1: Bulgolgi was decent. Not sure if the massive quantity being cooked at a hare's pace did it for me or not. Round 2: Octopus was delicious and maybe a tad salty in the sauce, but a treat to eat especially when they threw in noodles. Round 3: Rice and spicier kimchi is finally thrown in to soak up all the remnants of flavor and sauce left behind after cooking the meat and octopus. I was nearing full at this point and felt that the rice had a kick but overall a bland for my taste. Overall, I would never come back. I left feeling very disappointed after craving the opportunity to eat Korean style BBQ for over a year.

Now, the important point here: regarding the food everything is fantastic here.  The staples (Bulgogi, Bibimbap, JapChae) are incredibly good but I would say be adventurous as every single dish is delicate, prepare with fresh ingredients, and served in a very traditional appealing way.  If you are specifically coming for the Bulgogi you are going to have one of the bests and if I can make a suggestion try the ChaDol-Gui for a change.  You will be surprised how amazingly good this dish is!!!!

I was told that it was even worse when you don't come with Koreans - they just don't get you things and forget about you. Instead of being impatient, you should be more assertive and just remind them periodically. If you like chadolbaegi (thinly sliced beef brisket), you're in luck. With tax+tip we paid $16 per serving and were stuffed, and that is SO much cheaper than AYCE kbbq in the suburbs. I was told the slices are normally thinner (like they are everywhere else), but on our day it was particularly thick, tougher, and took a long time to cook... so it may or may not be worth the wait on your day.  Then again, the side dishes were delicious (the shredded green onion wasn't thinned out with lettuce, for one) and at the end of the meal, they cook fried rice on the stone pot with side dishes.

But once your'e seated, expect a treat.  Thankfully, we went on the early side of a Saturday evening and got seated right away.  And ordered what we order there about 90% of the time - Haemul Pajun to start, and the Chadol Gui.  The Pajeon, a seafood pancake, is always a nice start to the meal - crisply cooked with a good mix of scallion and seafood, mostly pieces of squid. Then comes the meat fest - ordered the Chadol Gui - deli-sliced brisket, so thin that a few seconds grilled on the stone pot is all you need.   The order for two is a huge amount for two people, and a solid amount for 3 or 4.  The panchan is a good variety and all fresh with two types of kimchi.  The shaved scallions are a nice touch as well. The best part of Cho Sun Ok - once you're done with the meat, the pot gets cleared, and they swing up a nice plate of kimchi fried rice, the perfect end to a meal that hits the spot.

2014-07-04,4.0,"I have written about so many Korean restaurants in Los Angeles that I am a bit stumped as to how to proceed with this well established Chicago based Korean BBQ place. First off, Chicago's Korean community is much smaller than LA's. This means less competition, and harder to get ingredients. So of course Chicago;s prices will be higher, and the chance of coming across an all you can eat place is far less. So all I can focus on is the quality of the food in the environment of Chicago's Korean population. That said, the food here was really good, although each order cost a lot and it was difficult to get a variety as I do in LA. Unlike in Los Angeles, where you order a small portion of about six different meats... at Cho Sun Ok you order on one or two meats, but you get a lot of each. I saw many couples splitting one huge pile of BulGoGi, and having the time of their lives. I also saw entire Korean families of ten ordering three or four dishes plus a stew and a pancake, and they were having great fun too. It is a different mind set in Chi... more like a big meal, rather than a huge feats. However, my favorite thing about the Korean BBQ is not the meat, it is the Banchan (the little dished of pickled and cured vegetables and fish). And at Cho Sun Ok, they bring out a hell of a lot more Banchan than any place I go to in LA. I know a numer of Chicagoans that swear by this place as the best Korean in town. I have to admit... after trying out a few places in Chicago... Cho Sun Ok was and is the best.",0.9901,0.819,0.151,0.03,0.47876344086021505

Side dish quality is a good indication of what you will get at these places-- and in this case, they were great.  At lesser places, you can tell that they've been sitting out for a while, but not here.   I went alone, but as with most ""hands on"" KBBQ places the setting is great for family groups or dates.",0.9938,0.771,0.22,0.01,0.6116402116402117

We were told of this place by one of our friends. She said that it's the best in the area. So we already had high expectations before even stepping in the front door.  We got there around 7:30 on a weeknight. And it was packed! Good thing it was only two of us so we were able to skip the entire line and sit at the only table available which happened to be a two-person table. There were three groups ahead of us and were waiting for a bigger table. There isn't a hostess to get ur names and out u on a waiting list. It's just first come first seating I guess. Right before we sat down at our table there was an argument about who was here first between two other groups and it got a lil heated. So I docked 1 star because of possible issues like this at this place.  My wife ordered the duk mandoo gook and I ordered bibim naeng myun and kalbi. The banchan (side dishes) came out first. And plenty of it came out. And it was so good. 100x better than the Korean restaurant we went to in Ann Arbor (see my other reviews). We finished a few side dishes and complimented (in Korean) how delish they were. And the lady brought out more for us very quickly.  Our entrees came out fairly quickly and they were all good. Kalbi was awesome.  I've read some reviews saying the service is subpar. But I didn't feel like it was. It's not a 4 or 5 star restaurant with a hostess and a crew of waiters and waitresses. It's a small Korean restaurant and a few ppl as a wait staff. And with that in mind, we were served pretty well.  This place does get real crowded. I can't imagine what it'd be like on weekends.

The soup was good in terms of flavor, but I definitely have had better. Didn't have a lot of seafood as other Korean restaurants I have been to. - Love how they utilize the remaining side dishes to make kimchi fried rice! Great way to end the meal. My type of happy ending! Although the place doesn't look that welcoming at first, this place is a definite treasure. Been driving by this place for years and finally I walked in! I am glad I came across it and gave it a shot. The ONLY flaw about this place is honestly the service.

One big complaint I had was the service. Obviously, the language barrier was huge and muddled. It was hard to communicate, and we expected it to be like this because of past experiences with authentic korean bbq. Servers were kind of rude, seemed like if you weren't korean, they weren't as attentive. However, the food was delicious in spite of the service.  We got the kimchi tofu soup with seafood because of the cold weather. It was savory with soft tofu in the spicy broth. There was a lack of seafood though, but the broth made up for the 'seafood' aspect of this dish.  We chose the thin meat slices versus the other options. The meat was definitely a good portion for two. The servers cook for you so that was definitely a good experience. As well, they teach you how to pair up the banchans with your meat. It was succulent and delicious. And at the end, they made us some kimchi fried rice which was unexpected. The crispy rice from the bottom with sizzling vegetables and left over meat. Yum! It was definitely better than I expected. If you have a grim about service, this is not a place I woulf recommend.

I guess you don't come here for the service.. they don't take down your name.. You have to stand in line and as soon as you reach in front.. they will ask how many parties you have..

2014-02-12,5.0,"I think this is the one of the best Korean BBQ restaurant in Chicago. I heard that this place was really small and the wait is long for a table. Luckily, my friends and I arrived when there was one table available.  Unlike other Korean BBQ restaurants with grills, this place has stone pots. We ordered the ChaDol-Gui, BulGogi, Galbi-Gui, and KimChi JjiGae. We started with the ChaDol-Gui. The thinly sliced beef was tender and well-complimented by the side dishes and dipping sauces. It is similar to the Beef Brisket from Woori Village, but it was fresher here. The Galbi-Gui came as a separate dish. The charcoal-broiled beef short ribs were delicious I would like it to have some slight burnt pieces on the edges to give it a nice crispiness. Next onto the stone pot was the BulGoGi. The beef was tender, juicy, and well-marinated; it was sweet and not too salty. The KimChi JjiGae did not stand out among the kimchi jjigae from other Korean restaurants I went. After we were finishing up our last meat, the server placed most of our side dishes onto the stone pot along with a few more ingredients and rice. I have never seen this before. This kimchi fried rice was very delicious because it was mixed with all the flavors and juices from the meats and the delicious side dishes. The variety of flavors and textures within the fried rice was further enhanced by the stone pot making the bottom of the rice crispy without burning it black. The service was better than most Korean BBQ restaurants. They actually cook and serve you food; however, it felt a little rushed because the server had to attend to other diners. I was a little disappointed because our side dishes and water were not refilled when asked, but it's okay. I walked out happy and full. As I walked out, there was a huge line waiting.

We didn't have reservations so right off the bat we were okay with waiting for a table to open up. The problem started when we entered the place and immediately found about 15+ other people standing around like sardines in the tiniest entry way ever. It must've been less that seven feet of space from the door to go outside to the unmanned hostess booth and every inch of that space was taken up by people waiting. Amidst standing there shivering to near death because the door either woundn't remain closed or someone was entering/leaving, all the people waiting started wondering if anyone's actually been acknowledged by the staff. Turns out that out of the 3 or 4 parties waiting there the staff had only talked to one. From where I stood I could see over our crowd and noticed that all of the workers kept busy and none even bothered to check the situation by the door. Just poor management of the situation, that's all. Add to that how it was freezing cold and none of us were given an estimate wait time for a table let alone greeted. Half of those parties waiting ended up leaving due to being ignored. We followed suit. I don't think I'd go back again even if I was guaranteed a table.",0.0418,0.878,0.063,0.059,0.42468671679198

The waitress was chatting with the group and cutting their food; she was very attentive to them.  Livid, my husband got up, interrupted the waitress, and asked her (politely) to take our order. For context of story,  I should mention that I am half black and half Korean (I am fairly dark skinned) and my husband is white.  My husband wanted to leave after he noticed that the table across from us were served.  I begged to stay because I really wanted to try the food.   Anyway, we finally placed our order.  We ended up waiting another hour for our food to arrive!!  The large party across from us left before we were even served our meal.  I don't really know why I insisted on staying-- I guess I was curious to find out how long they would pretend we didn't exist.  After probing the waitress a couple times about when the food would arrive, we decided to leave.  As we stood out of our chairs to leave, the cook rushed out of the kitchen with the food.  We sat back down and ate.  Though the food was delicious, I will never give them my business again.   I didn't want to jump to the conclusion that we were served last because of my race.  I told my Korean friends about my experience.  One them has a mom who happens to be close friends with a waitress at this restaurant.  She confirmed that they deliberately serve whites and Asians first because they think they'll get a better tip.  Talk about a slap in the face!!",0.9144,0.886,0.07,0.045,0.4308401751505201

I am a little annoyed by the constant flow of people walking ahead of me to see if they can put their names down (FYI you can't). When your only waiting area is a tiny crammed space between the two doors, that can get old fast. If the line gets past the door, it's kind of an honor system then because I have seen a bunch of people just crowding the door and not forming a line. Why is there usually a wait? Because the place is tiny. Expect to be very close to your neighboring table and if you're unlucky enough to get stuffed into a chair in the walkway, expect to get bumped by people. The chadolbaegi is good but nothing that really wows me.  As stated, service is not that great. They've never been very mean to me but they also don't really care. It may take a minute to get refills (on panchan, drinks, etc...) or it may never come because they just forgot. They do get their essentials down fast though (Get your order, bring first panchans, bring your meat, make the fried rice at the end). They just don't care. My bf was distraught when they sped off with one of our dishes and there was a big slice of haemul pajeon left on it. They took off so fast that we couldn't even utter a sound.

Here's the thing about attending a GOOD Korean restaurant.    1) Don't expect grade A service because that's not why you go.  It is expected to have your server to be a tiny, aggressive, straight to the point woman who is here to pump out a plethora of dank pickled goodness and get the hot plate going.  If you're looking for a smile and an in depth explanation of how a dish taste.... than you have no business being there.   2) Go in knowing that you will be crammed in like sardines and probably sitting so close to your neighbors that you have no choice but to listen to their banter because that's how good the food is here and everyone wants to eat here. 3) NO YOUR NUMBERS. Majority of the time no one knows the name of the deliciousness presented on the menu and the server never expects you to.  Just know the number of the dish you want and they'll make it happen.  They key is to be efficient as possible in the ordering process.... don't waste their time trying to pronounce dish items because you want to seem cultured and PC. 4) Don't lounge.  Get in, eat, and get out.  As much as you want to sit down and converse.... there's an entire line out the door giving you the stink eye because you decide to take a breath in between bites 5) Don't complain about the wait.  It wouldn't be good if there wasn't any wait. Now that we got the ground rules out of the way, let's talk food! Boiled and fried dumplings... delicious.... but there dumplings so you can't go wrong BBQ pork: spicy, tasty, addicting Bulgogi: tender, flavorful, juicy  Hot and sour tofu soup with seafood: you could tell that they either make their own tofu or they get a high quality brand because the creaminess and texture s not one to be bought in stores.  Broth was excellent and the seafood portion was spot on. Vermicelli noodles with seafood: fantastic!

Chosunok is my happy place in Chicago.  There are lots of complaints about service in the reviews, but this place isn't for people wanting to get coddled--the reason they can accommodate their long crowds, provide quality comfort Korean food, and keep their prices low is because the servers are quick and efficient. Considering that they are flipping meat, bringing you water and a dozen ban chan dishes (and refills), I have no complaints that they're not smiling and making conversation. If you are unfamiliar with Korean food and how it works, the lack of guidance might be offputting. But its worth it! Order the cha-dol-bae-gi and eat it with grilled garlic, kimchi, and any combination of the side dishes.",-0.8486,0.787,0.082,0.13,0.5092592592592591

Cho Sun Ok's meats particularly """" is highly recommended. Among all the Korean Restaurants who offers Korean BBQ style cooking I have been, Cho Sun Ok gives me the taste which I call it as Korean Style soul food or/and comfort food. Although, Chosun Ok often has long line of waiting list during dinner time and limited parking lot, it is worthwhile to visit at least once while you are in Chicago or a near area. A few areas that I would like Cho Sun Ok to improve are their service, restaurant cleanness, and their restroom. When Cho Sun Ok has a full of customers and very busy, most customers might be happy to wait patiently until they get their seat: however, sometimes, their patience runs out unexpectedly when Cho Sun Ok hostesses express their frustration to customers. Particularly when non-Korean or Korean customers visit Cho Sun Ok for the first time and need some explanations (menu) from hostesses during busy time, it is very hard to get the desirable answers.  * Service: Poor  * Price: Average (reasonable)  * Atmosphere: Below average (Crowded and a bit noisy when the restaurant has a full of customers, Cleanness of restroom)  * Food Quality: Taste is above average and quality is not known yet.  * Parking: Limited due to too many customers but there are many available spots on the street  * Avoid factor: Dinner time during winter - Due to Chicago's harsh winter and possible long line of dinner customers, you may end up waiting outside of the restaurant. If you are new to Cho Sun Ok, you may want to avoid busy dinner hours. Do not order too many foods since most of Korean BBQs, you can ask for stir-fry rice after BBQ (awesome flavor!).  * Recommendation: One hour dinner plan with your friends may not be enough during busy dinner time, be prepare to have a long hour dinner, Try """"",0.8748,0.85,0.097,0.053,0.49256532861078317

2013-10-21,2.0,"Okay, Cho Sun Ok, you were kind of a zoo. I've wanted to go to an authentic Korean bbq place for a while since I've recently become a bigger fan of Korean food in general, but unfortunately this place did not leave me longing for more. I came here with my husband and my two friends on a Sunday around 4:30pm and it's good that we did since there was only like 3 tables left and the place is tiny, and a half an hour later it was completely full. What annoyed us is that even though there were 3 tables left, we were sat at the smallest one and when we asked to be moved to a bigger table just because we felt a tad cramped, the lady told me "" nope, that's an 8 person table."" If she meant 8 midgets, fine. I guess I was just going to let that slide.  Then when it came to ordering we got the dumplings as an appetizer and they were nothing special nor flavorful so I would skip those. Then they have these cooking packages for $25 and we wanted to get two of the bulgogi since we're a fan of bulgogi and there were 4 of us. I asked if they can put that rice on top as I read about in many of the reviews. She flat out said, nope, it doesn't come with rice and made us order another dish that apparantly comes with rice. I mean, after having both the bulgogi and the other fatty meat that she advised us on, I don't see why they couldn't have just given us the rice with bulgogi and bulgogi alone. Oh well, we were given all the little dishes that were decent in taste. Then that other meat came up that was super fatty which my husband hates and it didn't have that much flavor, it needed salt and sweetness or spiciness, just everything. We didn't like it at all. Afterwards, came the bulgogi which was tasty but we would have liked more of it since we liked the sweetness of the meat, but apparently we couldn't have had rice with it even though the rice was given right after the bulgogi. So if I ever come to this crazy busy, they will not refill your water for a while establishment, I will ONLY order the bulgogi and make them put some rice on top with the kimchi and all the other fillings even if I have to pay extra for it. I just don't like when someone forces you to order another type of meat just for the rice, it didn't make sense. Overall, it was super hot in there, super congested, the place is tiny, they are not super friendly at all and the food was alright. I guess I will just stick to Korean food served as a meal and not where you cook it by yourself. Oh and after everything the kimchi fried rice was just okay, too much sour flavor to it in my opinion.",0.9946,0.809,0.143,0.047,0.5017857142857144

The service here isn't as bad as everyone claims it to be though, but still could have been better.  They only refilled our water and any side dishes that were empty when asked, but they did take the time to help us cook our meats and made fried rice with our leftovers.  Overall, I think Cho Sun Ok offers average food and service.  I don't see myself coming back anytime soon to wait in an hour line.",0.953,0.825,0.124,0.05,0.49596908939014206

You will know what I am talking about as soon as you step in coz they are EVERYWHERE permeating the air and occupying your mind until you order it. Plus, you would probably feel like a great chef coz seriously, the meat is marinated perfectly and anything cooked on a the Korean equivalent of a hibachi is legit. I can only imagine because we did not order one. This leads us to Pointer #2. Pointer #2 - Just because other patrons seem to be loving their food, does not mean you will like the dish. When the waitress asked you in a concerned tone ""This is spicy! Are you sure?"", you should give it a second thought. I am referring to the spicy naengmyeon (cold noodles with broth) that I ordered. Prior to Cho Sun Ok, I had one naengmyeon experience and it was wonderful. I guess I must have gotten a regular version coz boy, the spicy one at this place was very strong. I am used to Sichuan spicy not Korean spicy so sadly I did not enjoy it. Pointer #3 - When in doubt, order barbecue. Their barbecue is amazing. Korean BBQ is not a hype - it is a real and competitive rival of your regular American BBQ. Portions are generous here and you actually become full from just eating it, and satisfied.

This bulgogi wasn't some mishmash, shredded beef soaked in sauce that I'm used to receiving at every Korean restaurant.  No, this was big slices of beef.  If you can imagine if a steak was put through the thickest setting on a deli slicer, you get the idea of the size of beef slices you get.  Hallelujah! We ordered the non-cook-at-your-table portion, so they cooked these beef slices in a broiler in the corner of the whole dining area, which I thought was interesting.  But when you get it and bite into it, you can see it's very tender and well marinated.  You can tell it's quality beef they're using -- it wasn't tough, nor did it have any chewy bits. 3 stars, because I've had better Kimchi Jigae elsewhere -- poor amount of pork, but the tofu and kimchi were good.  Also, service was meh -- they need more servers.  Throughout our dining experience, we were at a lack of water at all times, and even if they filled it, they only filled it halfway, as if they were rationing it.  Also, I don't think they completely listen to you, because sometimes when we tried to order specific encores of panchan, they brought everything else but the ones we wanted.",0.9015,0.882,0.085,0.032,0.5329166666666667

I usually get pizza while visiting Chicago because who in their right mind wouldn't, but this time I wanted something different and was craving my recent obsession, Korean BBQ. Cho Sun was much different than what I'm used to in CA. First, it is not all you can eat and they have you cook the meat in a pan rather than on a grill. They didn't really have much of the ban chan that I liked, but eh, all Korean BBQ places vary on that, so that's whatever. The place was extremely packed and their waitresses were pretty unfriendly. The meat seemed to be pretty good quality and tasted good. It was on the high end of what KBBQ usually is at $25, especially for it not being AYCE.

We had to wait in a cramped area for about 15 minutes before we were seated. Unfortunately the table was right by the door, so while other people were waiting to be seated (which they were the entire time we were there) the door kept opening and closing, so it got pretty cold. Like I said though, we brought wine. My girl ordered, so I don't know exactly what she called it, but it was thinly sliced beef. They brought it with like 12-15 other bowls of all kinds of stuff. Tofu, seaweed salad, sweet yuca or plantain, kimchi, onion, been sprouts, sesame oil, and a whole bunch of other stuff. We had a great time cooking our beef and trying everything. Just when our meat was gone, and I thought we were all done the waitress came and dumped the kimchi, bean sprouts, and onion in the pan along with some rice and made us KIMCHI RICE! (kimchi rice = awesomness). The only problem with this place is.... before we left my girl ordered something for her husband. Because we knew they were packed we left our table to be cleaned for someone else and waited by the bar. Even though we got up the attitude of the waitress seemed that she was very annoyed at our to go order, and had no problem letting us by her frequent scoffs and couple of ""accidental"" pushes that we were in her way.

2013-02-07,5.0,"I try to hit up Cho Sun Ok at least once every time I visit Chicago. Last time being mid/end of December. Just a few heads up about this place, and restaraunts like this place. 1) The waitstaff here consist of about 3-4 people on a normal night. One curly haired women is EXCEPTIONALLY nice. There is another who is the opposite. I will let you find out for yourself. ;)  By the way, it doesn't matter if you're white, asian, or whatever. The rude one is sort of always rude/curt. Haha. 2) This is a Korean BBQ restaurant. Have you ever been to one before?  There are two types of Korean BBQ restaraunts. One is where they give you meet and let you go at it!  Second is a very frequent style in which the wait staff will cook for you in front of you. Now, on a busy night that may seem like a way to get you to eat your food and get out of there. (True it may be) But that's how these kinds of resturaunts WORK. In Korea, and ultimately the States. Yes they will grab the tongs from you if you look like you're having trouble, or if you're too busy eating they will grab the tongs from the table and cook it themselves for you!  If you don't like it, just tell them ""Oh could you wait to cook the meat?"" politely. Just say something. Don't just sit and take it!! If it's cooked enough you push the meat to the edges, and lower the heat. That way it's there for you to eat it. Anywho to continue, besides their meats, and what not they have a plethora of other Korean dishes. It's always in good nature to end with a chilled bowl of ""Neng-myun"" which is chilled noodles. I personally like eating that along with my meat but if you don't tell the servers that, they will wait until the end to give it to you. This place is BYOB, so if you're of age, maybe bring a few bottles of beer or if you forgot you can just go to the Jewel about 5 minutes walk down and grab a 6 pack of something. Also, this restaurant is not very big. If you decide to come during the dinner rush, you'll find that there is a line going in and around the place. Good luck! I really like this place because if you're headstrong, patient but not rude the servers will give you what you want. And it's damn good.",0.9724,0.875,0.093,0.032,0.3899159544159544

Ordered 4 serving for 3 people. Quality of meat was amazing. Hands down best Cha-dol in chicago area. Flavor and the large portions make it worth every dollar. The side dishes are pretty high quality and very tasty. BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE! At the end of your meal, they bring out rice and fry it in the same pan the meat was cooked in. They add all the side dishes and make a very tasty fried rice. My only dissatisfaction was the responsiveness of the service. Had to ask for water about 3 times before actually getting someone to grab the pitch of water. You have to know what you're ordering. They don't mess around with 'oh whats good here' or 'what do you recommend.' I cant imagine what the service would be like if I wasn't korean and didnt know a lick of korean struggling to figure out what to get. Trust me, just get the Cha-dol, you wont regret it.

There are a couple of tables in the center, and a few booths around the outsides of the diningroom. Seating is limited, so do your best not to come during peak times.  The restaurant is BYOB, which is a total plus. BYOB creates an immediate, cozy, homey feel. It kindof reminds me of stopping over at your best friends house after work with some brewskis and take out food. Only you are dining in, and the food is ubdoubtedly gonna be so much better here.  The tabletop grills here are hysterical. Instead of spiffy, built-in grills this restaurant brings out these little tabletop grills of all shapes and sizes. They are of the variety that your grandma would take if she went camping fiftysome years ago. It is so cute and still totally does the job.  We ordered bulghogi to share, and what a great decision that was. You receive a large amount of meat, and since the marinate is so gorgeously, sinfully delicious you would easily be overeating if you'd order your own portion all for yourself.  Bulghogi is one of those dishes that are very hard to mess up in my book. It is almost always a glorious feast of flavor, and I will go as far as saying this may be the best I have had so far. The meat caramelizes in such a manner that you will soon find yourself scraping the pan for itty bitty pieces stuck in the bottom. It'll make you feel like a total hobo, but you must not waste a single piece of this Godly goodness.  The banchan are good, but be careful when asking for refills. The waitstaff seems perpetually crabby, so much so that I laughed out loud at the user comparing this place to the 'no soup for you' skid. It really sortof is like that here. Also, check your water before you drink it. They tend to give out some oddly colored brownish-yellow water. I have still not deciphered what this was, but it was oddly tasty.

2013-01-04,4.0,"Wowza. If you have not set foot in Cho Sun Ok Korean Restaurant, you have been missing out big, and I mean BIG.  This is a late review but I came here for the first time over Labor Day weekend when my parents were in town visiting me since I had just moved to Chicago for a new job. My dad insisted on only eating Korean food while he was in Chicago so I checked yelp and found this place. The best part is that Cho Sun Ok is only 1 mile away from m For being a full blooded Korean myself, this place is off the chain! For a Friday night, this place was quite busy but we got a table right away and our waiter came by with our drinks as soon as we sat down. I loved that since in the Korean culture, it is all about hospitality. Then, our waiter brought out many banchan. Banchan are small dishes of food served along with cooked rice in the Korean cuisine. The great thing about Korean restaurants are that banchans are always FREE! Yes, free! Banchans are mostly consisted of: - bap (cooked rice) - guk (soup) - gochujang (spicy red chili paste) - jjigae - kimchi (Kimchi is fermented vegetables, usually baechu (Napa cabbage), seasoned with chili peppers and salt. This is the essential banchan of a standard Korean meal. Some Koreans do not consider a meal complete without kimchi) Other banchan that were served were the following: - kongnamul (which are old boiled bean sprouts with sesame oil) - sigeumchi namul (lightly parboiled spinach dressed with sesame oil, garlic, and soy sauce) - miyeok muchim (a seaweed with sweet vinegar and salt) - musaengchae (long julienned white radish in a sweet vinegar sauce, sometimes with ground dried chili peppers) - gosari namul (prepared fern shoots that have been stir-fried) - gogumasun namul (boiled/seasoned sweet potato shoots) - gaji namul (boiled eggplant) - and lastly, doraji namul (which are boiled bellflower roots) And yes, I repeat, these are all free! Then we ordered the chicken and beef galbi for our main entrees. To be honest, I am very picky with galbi and in case you do not know what galbi is, let me school you. It is made with marinated beef (or pork) short ribs in a ganjang-based sauce (Korean soy sauce). In the Korean language, galbi literally means ""rib"" and can often indicate uncooked ribs. In this case, our galbi was perfectly marinated and tasted exactly how my grandmother and mom makes back in the motherland.

My friends like the kimchi fried rice that they serve at the end and the Chadolbaegi and Bulgogi was decent. Regardless of the food, no restaurants should have this kind of service.

Our party isn't all there yet but we said it's alright, we'll order for them so we'll get out faster. The Chadolbaegi comes out first and the lady keep coming back and dumping meat in the pan. Basic cooking - you don't mix raw meat with cooked meat. The lady dumped raw meat into the pan and then distributed the cooked meat to our bowls. Fine, maybe they're just stupid. By the time the bulgogi comes in, we ran out of side dishes and water. We had 8 people and the side dishes are probably enough for 4 people. We asked for more side dishes. 10 minutes went by and no side dish. We asked again. Another 5~10 minutes and no side dish. Fine, maybe they're cheap and don't want to give customers free food.

We've probably spent about $18/person for the meal and they can't even fill up our water? This is ridiculous! Meanwhile, the line was getting longer and longer to get in. The table beside us finished eating and a couple of guys sat down where they were at. The waitress gave them some water. Apparently there wasn't enough in the pitcher, so they had to settle for a half a cup of water. Half a cup of water which they never come back to refill.

I would give it 5 stars if the service wasn't so bad (it would be better to bring someone who speaks Korean).

While I'm not sure we'd go back there, it was actually much better than I'd expected. The server suggested Bibimbop without the meat as a vegetarian option, and the rest of the people at our table got beef of some kind (she also recommended that, so they have no idea what they ordered). The service was quick, and the small bowls of kimchi, etc, were mostly very good.  I found it pretty funny when the server came and mixed our bibimbop/rice/sauce together (because I realized I was probably eating it incorrectly), but felt better when I saw she was doing it to others as well. :) I do wish I knew more about the food and menu so I could have branched out more, but if you're adventurous and don't mind suggestions combined with surprise, it's a great spot for authentic food.

The bulgogi was awesome, as was the pancake.  The prices are very reasonable and the service is very quick.

They asked us to choose the restaurant, since we had a full schedule and were dependent on public transportation. A staff member at our hotel, who was also Korean, recommended Cho Sun Ok. She said it would be a long haul for our friends, considering where they live, but don't worry -- they will not miss a chance to dine at Cho Sun Ok. She was right. They jumped at the chance. I second the comments of other reviewers that the service really does suck. Reading other reviews, that seems to be the rule rather than the exception. The service does not suck, however, if you are in the company of a Korean tae kwon do master with a magnetic personality. We were, and benefited from the association. I couldn't get the wait staff's attention to save my life, or to get refill on my water for that matter. But Jin could get whatever he wanted.  The food was wonderful. We had an item that does not appear among the menu selections you'll find on their website. It was beef brisket sliced deli-thin, then flash-fried in a stone pan over a burner in the center of the table. I forget the name, but it's in on the first page of the menu and it's apparently the house speciality. The side dishes & kimchis were plentiful and flavorful. Once we finished the main course the wait staff came to our table and whipped up a yummy fried rice using the side dishes we hadn't finished, similar to a dolsot bibimbap.

While there were only two of us, I like to look at all my options, especially at a restaurant I've never been to before. My date and I were asked five times in 2 minutes if we were ready to order. We finally succumbed to the pressure and just ordered something from the table top for two.  My belief is that when you go out to dinner, especially in a city where there are so many options, you should be able to relax a bit. The sour-pussed waitress came back and threw our ingredients for the table top at us. Some of the sauce actually spilled on my shirt. Soy sauce on white. Great. No apology. Just threw the beef in the pan at our table and handed us the tongs to cook. That's great. I love interacting with food, but it seemed that every other table was getting a bit of a demonstration as to what to do and how. Not us.  So we winged it. We tried everything from the bitter seaweed to the pickled veggies. It was okay. Nothing great. My date was afraid to ask for a fork due to the rude behavior of the waitress, so he struggled through with chop sticks.

2012-04-06,5.0,"Really some of the best Korean BBQ I have had. The service is not restaurant-like but its probably like home, where your mum indicates you to not make a fuss and eat your food like a good boy...no special over the top attention - only 'Here's your food - eat it!'...But then just like mum's cooking - REALLY good food doesn't require good service! The bulgogi was extremely well marinated and cooked on the table on a hot stone plate. In fact, I would recommend if you go to this place then just go for the Korean BBQ because some of the other dishes that my friends ordered, though good, were not as fantastic as the BBQ. The BBQ is their speciality and they do it very well. Also if not opting for the BBQ I would recommend the beef or pork dishes as some of the chicken or fish dishes may not suit all palates. There is of course a line that stretches to the outside and you should definitely consider a 45 min wait during peak periods. Also if you get the Korean BBQ they make a fried rice on that hot stone plate with your leftovers, that you can get in a doggy bag. But we did not get that. Why?

2012-04-05,4.0,"Like most typical Chicago Korean restaurants and the ones in Korea... don't expect that best or friendliest service.  In Chicago, I just don't get it.  Why do most Korean restaurants have crappy mean old ladies serving?  Do they not appreciate tip?  I'd be happy not to leave any if that's how they're going to be... HONESTLY!  I give this place a four star because every time I come the food is great!  One of the best places for all my favorite and plenty of... side dishes aka banchan.  Don't ever go with a big group.  Best to go with just one to three people with you otherwise you might need to wait a while.  I can't believe I did not find a review that I'd written on this place.   So, here goes.  I love the bbq here.  It doesn't matter that it's not all you can eat buffet.  The quality and quantity fits the price.  I thought that the prices were extremely reasonable.  Which I'd never noticed before.  Last night I ordered the chaddulgui, fried dumplings, mul nengmyun, my typical order.   The mandoo dumplings were so good.  I preferred my dumplings pan fried and filled.  Some places don't have large dumplings and they give you so little.  Here for just $4 they give you like 12!!!!!  MMMm.   The Chaddulgui (Thinly sliced beef), looked so small on the plate at first sight, but the more we ate and more we cooked, we realized how thinly sliced the beef was.  They brought out the green onions a bit late and I was disappointed yet again that they don't serve lettuce for wraps with the bbq.  I improvised with the pickled radish, and the kimchi.   The mul nengmyun (cold buckwheat noodle soup)... was okay.  Not over the top but decent.  I love the garnishes in it like the cucumber, meat, radish, pear slice, and half egg.  Half because they split our order for two people.  Good sense, people!!!!  To top off everything, they fry your rice in the bbq pan with kimchi, some spices, and veggies.  We were too full by then so I took it home.  Was still great for lunch today.  I'm not sure they serve alcohol or if it's even BYOB anymore.  I heard they lost their liquor license.. just FYI for you drinkers.   The only thing I gotta say that I HATED...   The waitress shoving plates around... REALLY LOUDLY AND RUDELY... like saying hurry, eat, and leave.  Like.. we're still eating here...  can you be any louder?  Why don't you just break the plates!!!!  Overall at the end, I just pay them right back... I don't say a word and I walk out.  Not even thank you or good-bye.  If anyone knows of a place that has good service, like Woo Lae Oak... AND great food, let me know.  Like by that I mean... a SMILE!!!!!!   Don't give me a bchy constipated persona, but why don't you make me want to pay for your services?",0.9963,0.795,0.158,0.047,0.546758011380653

2012-03-16,4.0,"I've been to Chosun Ok a couple of times now, and I've left happy both times. Most people will rave about the KBBQ, so I'll keep it short and say that it's good, but nothing amazing.  Chosun Ok actually has other really good Korean foods besides the more popular BBQ. I went back a couple of days ago we ordered the japchae (noodles with vegetables and beef) and hae-nangmyun (cold buckwheat noodles with a sweet/spicy sauce with raw skate). We were also served the traditional banchan with some rice.  The japchae was served piping hot and everything was fresh. I wish they would put in more mushrooms as I associate good japchae with loads of mushrooms. Overall it tasted just like how my mom makes it, which suffice to say is my favorite. The hae-nangmyun was unexpectedly great. The sauce was sweet and spicy, but there wasn't a lot of the skate fish in there. The ratio of sauce to noodles was off as well - not enough noodles. Toward the end, I got a bit sauce'd out from the sweetness of it. Still good, but overwhelming. 20% more noodles and it would be a perfect ratio.  Banchan is delicious here. You might not get as many here as other places, but everything is good, has the right amount of spice and flavor, and really gets you ready for your meal. I'll be honest - I could easily eat a meal here with just the banchan and rice and be perfectly happy. Service is like most Korean places - not the greatest. But we were able to order fairly quickly, the food came out quickly, but after that they were a bit hard to track down for the check.  Chosun is a great place to go, but I don't think it's worth waiting for a table for 1hr+ if you go on a weekend; there's plenty of other good Korean restaurants close by that will satisfy your craving if you so desire.",0.9987,0.691,0.278,0.03,0.5815910124733654

2012-03-09,5.0,"Disclaimer: I've been here countless numbers of times before, and I've always enjoyed the food. The decor is lack-luster, the space is pretty cramped, and if you come around 6-7 PM, it's going to be packed, buuut I've pretty much gotten over that. I've also come to terms with the stiff service from the ajumma. That being said, I'm pretty much just going to review the food.  I came here on a date last night, around 9 pm (an hour before close, there was no line) with a Korean dude. It was my first time going there with Korean company, but I didn't expect any stellar treatment from the ajumma just because he was Korean. However, it *did* help get the ordering process. We were both in it for the chadolbaegi. Ten minutes after ordering, our meat came out with the stone bowl. We had both been to CSO before, but it had been a while since he last dined there. When the banchan came out, he was kind of confused and asked, ""Where's the lettuce?"". One thing to keep in mind, CSO does NOT give lettuce with your meat. I'm sure you can ask for it but I've never done it, and neither did he last night. What chadolbaegi DOES come with are raw, shredded green onions. Don't get me wrong, I love wrapping meat in tons of lettuce, but the green onions go AMAZING with chadolbaegi. It also goes well with the garlic. Dude totally was hardcore and ate it raw, but I asked him if he could cook a few for me and he readily threw in a few cloves to get nice and softened/caramelized. The banchan was plenty and amazing as always (I'm not Korean, so don't hold me up on this, but I really, REALLY enjoy banchan). Last night was kind of a treat because we got water kimchi and large chunks of radish kimchi, in addition to the standard bean sprouts, tofu, sweet glazed potato/carrots, seaweed salad, cucumber, Korean potato salad (my ultimate fav banchan), pickled radish, and napa cabbage kimchi and other dipping sauces. The water kimchi threw me off because it was in a sort of soup bowl and we got two bowls of it, so I assumed it was soup. Upon asking Korean dude, he explained it was water kimchi. I've never had it before but it was YUMMY. Soo refreshing, crunchy, and light. Dude cooked the meat last night, so the ajumma pretty much ignored our table, which was fine. Times I've been there before, they would pile up the meat and leave it there before returning to stir it. Instead, of doing this, dude separated the meat and therefore the meat cooked faster and more evenly. I love my meat crunchy, so he left it a little longer in the stone bowl to get that crunch. Dude compared the chadolbaegi to bacon, and I totally agreed. The fattiness in the meat melts in your mouth like butta! However, I highly recommend you also dip it in the sesame oil and the fermented soybean paste for an extra level of fatty, salty goodness. After eating most of the meat, the ajumma returned to cook the awesome kimchi fried rice. Unfortunately, dude didn't touch the bowl and left it to the ajumma to cook...which kind of resulted in burned rice at the bottom. However, you MUST savor these burned bits! Dude thought I was crazy as I madly scraped the bottom of the bowl afterwards. He was like, ""Don't eat the burned parts"". It's not burnt..just crispy ; -d  We ended the night on an awesome note with barley tea and good conversation about politics. There was another Korean group aside from us at the end of the night chilling at the bigger tables. However, when 10:30 rolled around, the party got up and left, and we took the initiative to do the same. I guess because there weren't many customers who came after we ate, we didn't feel rushed to leave, which was a nice change. I guess that's the plus about going there after the busy hours. I guess my take-home advice for CSO is to come here for the Korean BBQ and be prepared to get stuffed with GOOD food (go for the chadolbaegi!!). You know that stuffed feeling you have after eating so much good food? Oh yeah, that's what we both felt last night. I was walking around with ~two-hour food baby in a food coma.

We ordered the cha dol bae gi and another unmarinated beef cut that was thicker (forgot the name... excuse my noobiness). Delish with the garlic and onion. Auughghghh.. so good.  We did expect to be ""pushed around"" by the waitresses (as others have mentioned), and we were totally expecting them to come over and show us how the bbq is done. Actually, I think we felt relief when they came over and silently scolded us for not doing it correctly. Haha. They care about us, yay! We actually had 3 or 4 waitresses coming over to help us. Some would walk by and push the meat around for us or turn down the heat. They were all very efficient and busy!

2011-12-10,5.0,"This is one of the few Korean restaurants left in Chicago that actually still makes decent Korean food. Their meat quality is top notch. Unfortunately this restaurant is in an area that has become overrun with hipster yuppies in the past decade or so. It is a very small restaurant and simply cannot handle the volume of non-Korean patrons that have extended 1 hour plus lines out the door or crowded around your table. Korean BBQ and Korean food in general seems to have become fashionable lately and trying to get a table while rude people loiter at their table long after their meal is finished has ruined the experience for me at one of my favorite restaurants. I am glad that they are doing so well now but it makes me sad that it is so hard to eat here now.  If there is one thing that I could convey to the non-Korean patrons of this establishment is to please be courteous of others who are waiting to be seated when you come to this tiny restaurant with your large groups by not loitering at your table. We can all enjoy this place if common courtesy is observed. Oh yeah, it's BYOB now. They used to sell liquor without a license for ages but with the gain in popularity came the scrutiny of the city. So if you're wondering why they don't carry soju or beer anymore it's because they can't.",0.9704,0.827,0.127,0.046,0.5483658008658009

Initially, I thought at first that I had to pay for street parking when in fact, street parking is free....a rarity in Chicago. Too bad I parked far down the street. The restaurant is a small establishment. There are only several tables, some of them have grills built into them and some of them use the portable grills. I ordered food that did not require the grills. I ordered a Soon Dou Boon which is Tofu Soup essentially. It either comes in two selections at this place, either beef or seafood. This place did not give me the option to select the spiciness.  One thing to note, I think next time I come here, I would do it at off hours because those Korean ladies were just running around the restaurant like crazy. I left bad for them. When my beef tofu soup came, it was accompanied by a good assortment of ban chan (side dishes). The soup was somewhat spicy, just the way I like it although I wish I had more water to wash it down with. It was difficult to get a waitress to fill my water cup because they were extremely busy. I really enjoyed eating here. Another note, I sat adjacent to the door which was not very good because when someone opened the door, it directed a cold draft to my back.

I do understand this is inevitable in a cramped restaurant (which by the way exceeded its 50 person occupancy limit), but the fact they did not apologize or even flinch about these mishaps spoke volumes about the personality governing this staff. Secondly, while I'm still on the waitstaff, this rudeness extended into all other aspects of dining. Requesting more water was a 20 minute, 3 request endeavor. The staff was complaining to us because half our party was 20 minutes late. The waitress grabbed the tongs out of my girl friends hands without asking for it. And the list keeps on going. Thirdly, the only positive aspect about this place was the food quality. But honestly, it is quite similar to other Korean BBQ joints which makes this positive obsolete.

But definitely don't be like ""oh, I taught in English in Korea so I know what's up"" becuase that's probably even worse than being not-Korean and with zero Koreans.

2011-07-29,2.0,"I had the most bizarre experience at Cho Sun Ok. I walked into the restaurant, towards the cashier so I could order take-out. First off, the cashier/pick-up area is located in the opposite corner from the door  so I had to maneuver myself around the packed eating area to even place an order. I told the woman what I wanted, and even pointed to the menu to reiterate my choices. I wanted one order of a dumpling soup and one order of Doeji Gui. The cashier kept on asking me a question that I didn't understand so I just pointed to the menu again and thought we reached an agreement. I paid an amount that seemed like what it should've been and went food shopping while my meal was being made. 20 minutes later, I came back to pick up my food and the same lady handed me a bag (it was stapled so I couldn't check the contents until I came home). When I arrived home, I opened the bag (my mouth salivating from the thought of broiled pork) and discovered that I was given three small containers of dumpling soup. I live a good distance away from the restaurant, and it was late, so I just ate what I was given. It was good (not great) but did not satisfy my craving at all.  I just don't understand how my order could've been messed up when I went into the store personally, said what I wanted, and pointed to the menu TWICE.

The bad: Anyone would agree that service is one of the most crucial parts to owning a restaurant. Bad service and a good restaurant usually dont go together.

2011-07-28,1.0,"Oh. My. Gosh. How a restaurant like this stays open (and apparently busy at that) is beyond me. Just to preface this review, I am Korean. I am currently in chicago for my brother's graduation, originally from Orange county, ca. My parents want Korean food for our first meal here so i look it up on yelp and find that cho sun ok has hundreds of ratings and a solid four stars. Looks good to me. How very very wrong I was... I wish I could give negative stars. Restaurant was full when we walked in. In a nutshell, our experience was like this:  - We wait at the door for ten minutes. No greeting or acknowledgment from staff that we are new customers. We should have left when we had the chance. - We finally get seated after a waitress asks another couple to move to a smaller table so we can take theirs. I felt so bad I apologized. I saw this happen two more times throughout our dinner to other customers. I guess thats normal here.. - In five to ten minute intervals we receive our menus, chopsticks and napkins literally thrown onto our table, waters, side dishes also thrown onto our table so hard all the dishes clink and clank and almost fall off the table, and finally get our orders taken. I think.. Ok.. They're busy.. I suppose understandable. - Food comes out surprisingly quick. Everything was ok at best. At this point, we were all so hungry the nightmare of a service was  forgettable. - Now throughout our dinner I keep looking at the waitresses and not a single smile. I felt like i was literally in a nightmare. But the worst was yet to come.. - My dad goes up to the register to pay for our bill so we can leave and make room for new customers waiting. The old grandpa whom I guess is the owner punches numbers and tells my dad the bill is $50. My dad pays and walks back to the table and then asks me, ""did we order that much?"" I calculate and our bill should have been $35. My mom offers to go up to the grandpa for our receipt since we never received one. He first adamantly tells my mom that my dad already paid for the bill and the tab is closed out so it can no longer be viewed. My mom tells him that does not make sense and finally gets him to look at our check again. It turns out he overcharged us by adding two items we never ordered. Now my mom is really flustered and asks him what was going on and the grandpa nearly yells at her ""it was a mistake. I said sorry, didn't I?!!"". At that point I really wanted to say something but now wanting to just get out of there ASAP, we receive our $15 back and leave. Basically, it was as if he knew we were not from the area and wanted to take advantage of us tourists. Even my parents couldn't believe a Korean would do that to fellow Koreans.

My tofu soup came and I was expecting to drop my own egg inside of it, like I did in LA.  Only when I ate it, I realized it was somewhere already mixed inside of the soup.  Also, I didn't get my rice in a hot stone bowl- which is the part I really enjoy.

2011-05-28,2.0,"Cho Sun OK uses a gas stove and a stone pan for their BBQ. You grill your meat in the stone pan and all the flavors concentrate in it. Then in the very end of the meal, the servers would come with a bowl of rice or noodles and fry them up in the pan of delicious goodness. Good concept but I do prefer charcoal style BBQ at San Soo Gab San more.  That aside, I find that this place has some issues with their service. Servers NEVER smile and I always felt like we are being rushed out the door. The issue is that they grill all the meats for you faster than you can eat. I could hardly eat at my own pace and have a good dinner conversation at the same time. I wish they would stop doing that and let us do the work. Another thing is, they are less inclined than San Soo Gab San to change the grill pan. My mother is allergic to beef and we specifically asked that we want our BBQ squid first before the beef. But the beef came out first and we had to ask them to change the stone pan. The server was PISSED. We tried to explain that she was allergic to beef but she shuts us out and refused to listen. She did changed it in the end though. The fact that she refused to accommodate my mom's allergies is totally unacceptable.

I went with 3 girls(we're all pretty in shape but one of us is an athlete and two of us generally eat as much as a football player) and we ordered 4 orders of chadolbaegi. It was a lot of meat for 4 people but we ended up finishing every bit of it. If anyone's going as a couple, I'd say get 2 orders of chadolbaegi and you'll leave SO full. If 3 girls, I think you can get away with 2 orders too. If you're a guy... order 1 for each because their chadolbaegi is pretty awesome. BTW, chadolbaegi is thinly sliced beef brisket for those of you who don't know what it is. Their banchan(side dish) changes depends on what they have daily but when I went, most of the banchans were pretty good. I loved the yulmoo kimchi. The soup part of the kimchi is so refreshing when you're filling yourself up with the chadolbaegi. Also, they make some kind of fried rice for you after you're done with your chadolbaegi. It's really good and you don't want to be too full after chadolbaegi because you'll regret not eating the fried rice! The ladies  working there will randomly start mixing in various stuff and kimchi with some rice on the grill and it's very tasty :) For the service... I think the trick is to go a little before everyone else does. The ladies working there are not the most friendly people but they definitely put in effort to be more personable if you go when it's not too crowded. I went around 6 for early dinner and there were already 4 parties there(at least 12 people). The ladies were talking to us when they were serving us food and cooking our chadolbaegi and constantly brought more banchan to us as we emptied the dishes. But when the place started getting more crowded, they stopped talking to us and just cooked our food really quickly and moved on to the next table.

We were seated at a 4-person table and we ordered dduk gook (rice cake soup) and soondubu (spicy soft tofu soup).  Feeling sick, I sprawled across the two seats on my side, only occasionally getting up to have a bit of the dduk gook broth (which was good by the way!).  My mom finally decided that we should just pack up the rest of the food to-go and go back. As the bill was coming, I really felt like I was about to throw up, so I headed to the bathroom.  BUT one of their employees had just walked in as I was walking towards it.  I hurried back to the table and told my mom I had to go outside to throw up.  Though she looked worried, she asked me to wait until she handed the waitstaff our bill.

(2) Notice that 90% of the customers are ordering the cha dol bae gi (a/k/a chadolbaegi) as their (shared) entree, and so should you.  It's the item with the grilled thinly-sliced beef that you dip in a salty sauce and where, at the end of the meal, they make fried rice out of the leftover side dishes. (3) Cha dol bae gi is the *only* item that they make the fried rice afterwards.  It's not clear on the menu, and the waitresses are too busy to explain it, so please just try to remember it.  (Write it down.  Bring your Yelp app on your smartphone with you.  Whatever.) (4) The plethora of little side dishes are called ""banchan.""  It is acceptable to ask for free refills of selected items, but note this:  Although you may take your leftover grilled beef or fried rice home if you really must, you *can't* take your leftover banchan home.  It's just not done.  (Don't be offended -- again, it's not anti-non-Korean prejudice.  Look around: The Korean customers aren't taking *their* banchan home!)

Once it was on, we muddled our way through the meal by watching how our server was helping the group at the table next to ours. She never did stop by to assist us.  I love Korean food and as it goes this is one of the better places in the city however if you plan on eating here, make sure to show up with a Korean or 2 in your group if you expect to be served with some respect.

Seating was limited but we were seated right away as part of our party arrived earlier. We ordered ribeye steak and the baby octopus. After ordering such, the waitress brought atleast a dozen sides of marinaded so and so and pickled whatever. All were delicious and some were spicy. The beef (bulgogi?) came raw and the waitress tossed it into the cast iron pot with heated oil in the center of our table. We can smell the deliciousness cooking as we ate a few of our sides. She comes back a few minutes later and serves up the meat. While we heat, she brings in the baby octopus and cooks it that same way. It's spicy and very bold. As it is closed to done-ness, she throws in a bowl of noodles glass-noodles into the simmering broth. We were left to serve this last dish on our own but it was very tasty! The noodles soaked up all the flavor that otherwise wouldve been left in the pot and discarded.

If you aren't Korean, then you are going to get horrible service.  If you are Korean but don't say anything, you are also going to get horrible service.  Don't expect the Korean waitresses to cater to you. If you need something, ask for it as it gets extremely busy and they don't really speak english. We had to ask for our water glasses to get filled a few times before they were refilled.  I was pretty thirsty. Both times we had cha dol baegi (thinly sliced beef) which is what they are known for.  First time I went, the meat looked really marbled but I don't know if it was because we didn't cook it enough or something but the flavor was just bland and I had to definitely supplement it with alot of the sesame/salt mixture.  The Kimchi fried rice they made that time from the leftovers was also just ""eh"" for me. Second time, we got the cha dol baegi with a soup that I can't remember (something jiggae).  It was kind of too salty but alright.  Side dishes are also alright, kimchi was nice and flavorful.  There was such a HUGE DIFFERENCE between the first and second time coming here.  I think largely due to either the meat was better or we cooked it so that there was a near crisp on each side?  After all my Korean experiences, I have also learnt that the fried rice dishes taste better when there's a crispyness on the bottom from the stone pots.  Our waitress turned off our stove thing too soon and our rice wasn't crispy on the bottom...so we just went ahead and turned it on ourselves.  Don't be afraid to turn the stoves on and off yourselves to how you like your food! The waitresses are also a little ""judgmental.""  She told my Korean friend that I probably wouldn't like the Kimchi fried rice because I wasn't Korean!  *shakes head One order of cha dol baegi ($24.99) was more than enough to fill the two of us, so in reality, the price wasn't too steep at all! So why 4 stars?  Yes, service sucks, I've accepted that.  Service at San Soo Gab San also sucks so eh.  Woo chon has pretty good service, but I don't like their stove set-ups.  First time @Cho Sun Ok, I wasn't too fond of.  But the second time I was pretty happy with my food and that's what it comes down to for me! :)",0.9965,0.786,0.169,0.044,0.556604938271605

2011-03-06,2.0,"Eh....  I love nearly all kinds of Asian food, Thai, Korean, Chinese, etc etc, but this place simply left me feeling very underwhelmed. I came here with a group from work. The group consisted of a Korean man who is a regular here, along with four interns from Korea, and a couple other people. We were cramped in the middle of the tiny restaurant at two tables pushed together. Since the wait staff didn't understand English (or maybe just pretended not to), the Korean man in our group ordered this big communal feast, which consisted of about 450 little white bowls of pickled vegetables, sauces, noodles, squid, and all kinds of stuff. Everything was super duper salty and left me dehydrated, which was a problem in itself since the waitress initially only filled our glasses halfway (???) and never came back to refill until we were almost done. So here I am, my plate before me, surrounded by fifty thousand little bowls of stuff. It felt like a game of food Jenga, or Operation- one wrong move and the bowls start falling off the table. Then the waitress begins cooking thinly-sliced beef on our table, which was kind of cool, except that she kept hovering over me to flip the beef strips. She wouldn't ""cycle"" around and choose someone else to hover over, she just hated me I guess. So here I am, totally immobile out of fear of knocking something over or getting in the way of the meat-flipping lady, with a bad taste of salty something in my mouth and with an immediate need of some damn water. When the beef was done cooking, it was all I could stomach, but even that stuff was ugh. It's like, you either eat it like you're supposed to (dipped in one of 100 salty sauces) or eat it plain, in which case it is totally bland and akin to eating a Ziploc baggie. At the end, the waitress took all the food we didn't eat, and mixed it in the skillet with about 5 pounds of white rice and made the most disgusting concoction of fried rice I have ever tried (notice I said ""tried"", not eaten). More saltiness, not much flavor. Just salty and burned.  I give this place 2 stars because it may be unfair for me to judge a place like this so harshly. It just is not for me. I have eaten Korean food before that wasn't like this, but maybe this place is more authentic?? I don't know, whatever.

But with that said, we really enjoyed the full authentic experience and further enjoyed that it was BYOB and that the bill ended up being around $75 for 4 people (not including tip) which we thought was pretty good for how much food we got.  This place would have been pretty intimidating for me had I not gone with someone who knew a little about Korean food, however it is definitely worth a try.",0.995,0.735,0.219,0.046,0.5911495911495912
2011-02-17,3.0,"Korean BBQ.  The food factor: Got the short ribs (delicious), and the marinated beef. The beef was grilled on the BBQ plate at our table and was very succulent. The sauce was perfect. All of this came with a ton of tiny appetizer plates, which were fun. We also got the seafood pancake. It was great how our server cut it into pieces at our table using scissors - I love bucking cultural norms! But I thought it was too soggy. My friend really liked it, though, because it had either squid or octopus in it. The social factor: Previous reviews had said that if you're not Korean, you should be prepared to be treated like crap. I'm not Korean, so I came armed (emotionally). But our service was very prompt and polite - I've got no complaints. Maybe they read about their service habits on Yelp and decided to change? One strange aspect was that they do not take names, and so you just have to wait in line to get in. It was pretty cold and the line went out the door. I noticed that Korean people kept cutting in front, but I could not tell whether they were actually getting better service or whether they were part of large groups that had a designated waiting person at the front of the line. I am 99% sure that I saw one entire family cut the whole line and get seated immediately. But that's probably not the host's fault, because he was just calling over the first people in line without really taking tabs of who was cutting whom. Finally, the concept of the line was quite overlooked. It became more of a mob as more people showed up. I know that lines vs. swarms can be a cultural thing, so take this nugget as a piece of advice: don't let others walk all over you and then get upset. If there's no line, stand your ground.

First of all, it's closer and the parking's better. It's less expensive and the service is slightly better (though I think this has something to do with the location and the clientele rather than the K BBQ experience as a whole). It's BYOB and at the end, they pan fry up all the leftover rice, side dishes and meat for you to take home. Delicious.

We've been back here again and again and it never fails to delight!  I think a previous reviewer noted that this is authentic Korean which means that if you want your water refilled, they don't come around and refill it; you need to flag them down.  It's not poor service, it's the cultural expectation.  The first time it happened, I was like, ""Sheesh, what the hell?"" But after having it explained, it works just fine.   I love the ambiance in this place.  It feels off the beaten path - a-la-Anthony-Bourdain.  And it is.  Something this authentic and ethnic, with its hole-in-the-wall feel, is admittedly out-of-place on Lincoln and Berteau in North Center.  The table top stoves look like they are about to explode into flames and I'm sure I'm getting some kind of carbon monoxide poisoning, but these are all GOOD THINGS.  I'm tired of all these ultra chic, feng shui, minimalist Asian restaurants.  The rounded edge rectangular vases, square plates and chop sticks blunt the flavor of the food and cause all of them to blend into one.  CSO stands out as authentic and individual. Helpful hints before ordering:  Stop at the ubiquitous-big-box-grocery next door and pick up some Asian beer to enjoy during your meal.  The place is BYOB (YAY!) and it alleviates the constant need to flag down a waitress to refill your water. When you are ordering, you may be tempted to order appetizer, soup, entree, etc.  That is way too much food. The portions here are sizable and the kimchee is a meal in itself. Think about going family style for variety. The stone-top Korean barbecue with bulgogi is a safe start for newbees and few are disappointed by kalbi-gui, but my penchant for runny egg yolks and heat can only be satisfied by an awesome bowl of CSO's bimbimbap.  Note for those with a Midwestern palate:  Korean food has heat!

I honestly think that this is the only korean place that doesnt reuse their side dishes... mostly because its mixed at the end in the stone pot.. but you can just tell that every side order that comes out is fresh and untouched by another patrons chopsticks or fork or fingers... others can say what they want to say but there are plenty of korean joints around the area that just reserve side plates.. but thats not my battle to fight...  overall.. service is awesome.. food is awesome... cameras watching your car in the back in case a horrible driver/parker hits your car.. but they're gone anyways by the time you try to chase them down.. i have seen MANY A MANY of cars being dented in the back lot... i would say one out of four times I go there I've seen some idiot hit another car and just speed off like nothing happened.. so my only tip for this place would be to park on the street.. there are plenty around.. alot of movement in the area so people are coming and going very frequently.. be patient and look for a spot.. unless you don't care that your depreciating asset will trade in for 300 bucks at the car lot...",0.9018,0.895,0.068,0.037,0.5157465277777779
2010-12-20,5.0,"Please please PLEASE, if you are going to Cho Sun Ok for the first time and aren't going with a regular read through the reviews and make sure you know what you are doing.  This place really is a gem but it has a learning curve.  It really is a shame that so many people went and had such a bad experience because there are only a few simple guidelines (that you will see in this review and many others) which would have helped so much. So for first timers: #1.  Yes, there is a long line.  Don't show up starving because you will have to wait at least 30 minutes. #2.  Service is different here.  Waitresses expect to be flagged down when you need something (whether it is to order, to get more water, to pay... whatever).  Its not that they don't like white people, its that the korean customers already know that they have to flag down a waitress to get service.  Thats the way it works here (and many other coveted asian restaurants for that matter).  Just accept it.  Once you get the hang of it it works just fine.   #3.  Order the damn chadolbaegi.  Open a menu, point at it, and say that you want it.  If have a group and want more then fine, order chadolbaegi and something else.  Otherwise, experiment with other options on your second trip once you have the hang of how things work.   I promise you, I'm like craaaaazy white, but Cho Sun Ok is still at the top of my list of restaurants to hit up next time I get back to Chicago. I would have given it bad reviews too if I had expected the waitresses to come to me instead of vice versa.   Finally, once you do flag down a waitress, have a heart, notice how overworked they are and think about what goes into keeping prices for such high quality food low.  Could you imagine working in such a crazy place and always smelling like meat day in and day out for what is probably pretty terrible pay?",-0.7226,0.803,0.1,0.097,0.4293536487153508

The servers were extremely helpful (although our servers didn't speak English so it helped that my friend is fluent in Korean). We started with a seafood pancake (haemul pajeon) that was delicious and came out very soon after we arrived. Banchan (side dishes, pickles, etc) followed, and every one was great; the array quite plentiful. The baechu and kakdugi kimchis were great, although the winter kimchi really stood out as stellar. I had never had Korean potato salad and was quite impressed but this sweeter version of potato salad with apples. My friend got bi bim bap which she enjoyed and I had ujok tang, a stewed beef foot-and-tendon dish where the meat/cartilage was perfectly done: tender and smooth. The server was kind enough to cut the meat off the bones to make it more chopstick friendly. BYOB was a a plus as far as keeping this dinner very affordable.

How they Rock- non smoky because they use a large store shallow bowl as a grill that minimizes smoke and cooks more evenly, they make a fried rice towards the end with the sauces left in the grill and leftover panchan!, BYOB, and just awesome tasting food.  I took out a star because the service still could be better, I guess I have high expectations when it comes to being 5 star. If you are in their peak rush time, they will bring out the food really fast and rush you.  Doeji Gui- bbq beef sliced and marinated  Galbi Gui - marinated bbq beef on bone Yukagae Jang - hot spicy beef soup (unique smoky flavor that differs from other places) Korean Pancake $64 total for 4 people without tip. (we brought our own drinks) The place is also BYOB, which really makes it possible for an excellent night. I picked up a bottle or red wine and Heffe-Weizen beer at Jewl-Osco that is a block away from the restaurant.  Tip- be prepared to wait to get in- weekend peek dinner hours will have a wait.

The place does move really quick if you are waiting for a table so don't give up entirely. Bul-gol-gi is great but my favorite is the spicy pork dish called Doeji Gui. It's very similar to how the Bul-gol-gi beef is cooked, but the flavors are much more spicier. I'm on a forever quest to find great spicy dishes and this falls up there on my favorites list. Personally, I would skip the do-it-yourself bbq step since you can have it cooked even better by the real cooks in the back. It's fun with a group of people to bbq at the table, but it's also not necessary for a good meal.  The banchan (side dishes) are always great and they give you a great variety...about 12-14 of them. You can always ask for me, which I can't resist.  Fantastic prices and we never leave spending more than $35 (including tip) for two people.

There have been numerous occassions when the rude servers (2 in particular),  have ripped the tongs out of my hand while I'm cooking, and start cooking it I guess to what they assume to be ""the right way.""  I find this to be one of the most unprofessional things a server can do.

They hardly ever refill water or bring other drinks you order (tea or coke)....  They also NEVER bring white rice when we ask for it... .EVERY time I go there!..... and last thing I'm going to say about the actual restaurant is, WHY are those overhead ventiation hoods NEVER on!!???

Food:  We ordered #6 for three (i.e. divide the price for two by two and multiply by 3).  The waitress brought a plate stacked with thinly sliced beef and covered the table with at least 15 small dishes with various vegetables.  She slapped down several slices of beef into the hot pan which was meant, I think, a wordless how to lesson.  We took it from there.  Eventually N asked about the rice and the waitress returned with a small dish of some secret stuff and a bowl of rice.  She dumped it into the hot pan, stirred it and left.  Eventually she returned and stirred in some of the remains from the small plates.  The result was remarkably tasty.  I'm talking really tasty.

The panchan is pretty good - ranges from your standard kimchi to your cucumbers and also a great potato/fruit salad.  The best part of this meal is the fried rice they make at the end for you though, which is basically a kimchi fried rice.  Delicious.   Service was probably the only thing lacking.  Coming here with someone who is Korean and/or speaks Korean makes things easier.  However, you might be forced to cook your own meat and such when it is busy (usually is because the place is small).",0.9887,0.771,0.208,0.021,0.5458730158730158

We heard that service here was slow so that was no big surprise, but the server was incredibly rude to us. She actually put her finger in my friends' face  to symbolize that she'd have to wait when she tried to signal for more water. When she brought the water to refill the glasses a good fifteen minutes later, she spilled it all over my friend's plate and then never acknowledged that she did it. I will never go back here again based on the service alone. If anyone can recommend a friendly Korean restaurant, I would appreciate it!",0.949,0.718,0.188,0.094,0.48245614035087714

We also had the cold buckwheat noodle soup Bibim naeng myun which was also good.

2010-09-03,3.0,"Real deal Korean food. My friend and I ordered the bulgogi for two table-top dining, which comes with steamed rice, great kimchee and side dishes. I expected to be able to cook it over an open flame on a grill, not in a pot, so the meat ended up being steamed rather than seared, so I was a little disappointed. The flavor was quite good, and priced at $24.95, it was a huge amount of food for two people, so it was a great value. Our server literally did not utter one word to us. Like literally, not one single word. Nor was any eye contact made. It was kind of funny actually. The food speaks for itself. This place is small and gets crowded. Go early to avoid a long wait.

2010-09-03,1.0,"I have been going to this restaurant ever since I was three years old and one of the only places I remember my father ever taking me to. I am so sad that I have to write this review over and knock it's rating down to 1 star from 5. I went to Cho Sun Ok a few weeks ago and I was so disgusted by the service my best friend and I received. It was a Monday night and the place was bustling as usual. We started off with the spicy beef soup. The server never came back around so we could order our Bulgogi. We had to flag down the owner's wife to finally order after an hour! We finally ordered Bulgogi as we normally cook on our table, however the server decided we didn't need to cook, so she just brought out a plate of Bulgogi for one!!! I was extremely pissed off by this point. Through it all I did not complain or make a scene, although I thought about flipping the table (like Theresa did from The Real Housewives of NJ)! Then the owner's wife rudely shoved a chair into me, which she had taken from another table to make room. The entire disaster lasted  almost 3 hours without an apology or attempt to make things right. I could not believe how rude they were to my friend and I! I have seen and heard things about them being rude and racist, but did not want to believe it until now. My friend is Puerto Rican and I get mistaken for it all the time. These people should be ashamed of themselves! When I came in with my Korean detective friend, they were oh so nice and even gave us things that I did not even know were available there! Now, that is suspect! I honestly wanted to cry because I felt as though I lost a family member. I will never return to Cho Sun Ok...even if they were the last Korean restaurant on earth!

And I felt like the waitress was avoiding eye contact with us because it took us forever to flag her down to ask for 2 small bowls so we can share the spicy tofu soup.  Grant it, they were busy and there were only 2 servers.  But for some reason, I had a feeling that we were not getting the best service because we were not Korean.  I had the same experience at other Korean joints too and everytime I would go eat Korean with Koreans, the service was always much better.   The food is pretty good.  I love all the veggie side dishes they offer with every meal.  It definitely offsets all the meat you will eat.  They have really good spicy tofu soup and all of their meat selection for the tabletop cooking is great.  Expect to spend on average $25 for each of the tabletop meats.  But the rest of the menu ranges from $7-$15 which isn't bad.

The food easily achieves five stars, but the service just barely ekes out two. If you dine around six o'clock you will understand why. The only way to serve this many people in such a small space and attend to the line that often sprouts from the front door requires a certain brusque efficiency, not nicey nice ""take your time"" cordiality. But the food is worth it. The various kimchi run the gamut from sweet to fiery and make me happy every time. Bear in mind, if you are not Korean the waitress will almost invariably ask if you know what you are ordering, and will often repeat the contents of the dish to you just in case. Don't be offended. Don't you all have a picky sibling who vomits at the taste of hot pepper? Can you imagine what he or she'd do after eating a skate fish?

2010-08-04,5.0,"I had a sudden craving for Korean food and came here on a Sunday evening.  My internet was down so I wasn't able to properly prepare for a new restaurant (e.g. scan Yelp reviews for tips and tricks).  There were things I wish I knew before I came here and this one goes out to all the first timers: Walk Through Guide for Cho Sun Ok: 1.  Wear clothes that is ready for a wash - Yes, grab that pair of jeans you have been wearing for a week and that shirt you wore for half a day.  I am starting off with this as a reminder that you will smell like a piece of smokey meat dipped in soy sauce, vinegar and garlic sauce after you leave and will want to throw everything you are wearing into the wash after the meal.  You will also want to jump into the shower because your hair will absorb the stentch. 2.  BYOB - There's also a Jewel within walking distant if you need to pick some up.  You might want to bring your own water too because they don't do a good job with the refills. 3.  There is no hostess - There is no list to put your name on.  Find the end of the line and stand in it until you get a table.  If you want to know how long the wait is, you can ask the people in front of you.  Even then, you can only speculate. 4.  Order Chadolbaegee (Cha Dul Bae Gi or however else you spell it) (unmarinated beef) - Apparently, this is the in thing to order.  In my unenlightened state, I went with the ever popular Bul-go-gi (marinated broiled sliced beef) and was not disappointed.  Bul-go-gi for two for $25.  Open your menu when you are ordering so that you can point to the items you want.  This will help your waitress quite a bit. 5.  Pass on the spicy beef soup - The broth was quite bland, yet spicy...like watered down tobasco sauce.  Maybe that's how it is supposed to be?  At least I didn't get beef tendon like I did at SSGS as a result of a communication break down. 6.  Banchan arrives shortly after your order - these small dishes of food are quite delicious!  You can ask for more if you run out, but you'll have to get someone's attention. 7.  Leave the cooking to the waitress - We are used to cooking and flipping our own meat at Korean BBQ's, but almost got our hand slapped by the waitress when we attempted to touch the tongs.  ""Not ready!!"" 8.  Ask your waitress - I am adding this one because most of us are used to the waitress doing the asking.  If you want something, ask!  You won't hear the phrases below here: ""I noticed your water glass has been empty for the past 30 minutes, would you like some more?"" ""You still look hungry, did you want to order something else?"" ""You have finished eating, are you ready for the check?"" 9.  End of meal fried rice - I heard and saw but never got.  I think you have to order the unmarinated meat to get this.  The waitress will come by after the meal and dump your rice into the pan with some kimchi and whip up a delicious batch of fried rice with the left over meat juice.  It seems like every other table had this but us.  I actually tried ordering fried rice from the menu but they said they ran out.  Hmmm...very suspicious.   I would come back for the tasty food (minus the soup) at decent prices and relatively fast service. PARKING - There is free street parking nearby, but you might have to drive around to find one.  There was plenty enough on a Sunday evening.",0.9856,0.89,0.085,0.025,0.4845730027548212

We had a brief wait for a table but quickly settled in. The place is BYOB so Royce bought along a bottle of Framboise beer which was another first for me.  Royce ordered for the table (there were three of us) and the server quickly brought out what I can only describe as a barrage of Korean tapas dishes, many of which were slightly pickled.  We also ordered a portion of both fried and boiled dumplings which came to the table freshly cooked and were delicious. A different server began to prepare our main at the table which took about 10 minutes with a total of three visits to and fro to ensure the main was properly cooked. The server told us when it was ready and we helped ourselves to some of the most flavorful and tender barbecue beef I have ever tasted!

2010-06-13,5.0,"Famous For: (My rating in parentheses) - Chadolbaegi (10/10) - Banchan (Side Dishes) (10/10) Ethnic restaurants are hard to review or to take advice from. After reading a few reviews, some of the things people order and expect from this place are kinda weird. Perhaps to a non-Korean who's been to their fair share of Korean BBQ places, there are certain expectations for every DIY Korean BBQ that Cho Sun Ok doesn't meet, but that's like expecting great steak at a seafood restaurant. Natives have a completely different tongue and set of requirements when it comes to their own food than foreigners. Ever have a hamburger in Korea? They think it's all the rave, meanwhile, I thought it was terrible! So, with that in mind, I'm reviewing this as a Korean.. With a decent amount of traveling on my belt, I want to say that Chicago has some of the worst Korean food on the planet, contrasted by LA that has some of the best Korean food on the planet (better than Korea)! I've been to a ton of Korean places in Chicago (obviously), but nothing compares to LA except for 2 places, but 1 of those closed down, and the other is Cho Sun Ok. Despite what you may have read elsewhere, you need to order Chadolbaegi and go home. Don't bother with anything else. There's a minimum order of 2. Oh, and come here in groups of like 3+ (not too big because the place is tiny), never alone, there's no point. Chadolbaegi is basically very thinly sliced beef brisket. It's got a lot of fat around the edges of the meat. Once you order, they'll bring a portable Butane burner and a stone pan with some sesame oil drizzled on, and start to heat it. Along the way, they'll bring you some banchan (side dishes) and I am very very satisfied with all that they bring out. Not only is a a decent amount, but it's very good! The Korean potato salad is awesome and the kkakdoogi and kimchi are pretty good too. The sliced moo (radish) is excellent!  Anyway, the chadol comes out and they put a bunch on the pan and start it. You do the rest of the cooking. Chadol is very thin, so it cooks very fast. Almost as soon as it's on the pan, you can see it browning, so you flip it for a few seconds, and then take it and eat it. You dip it in the sesame oil/salt/pepper mix too. Personally, I just love getting several pieces of meat, lightly dip in the sesame oil mix, and then piling some kimchi, moo, and just taking that in 1 mouthful. I'm the type of Korean who eats very minimal or no rice with Korean BBQ. You have to specifically ask for rice if you want it. Usually, after the meat, I'm already pretty full. But when your meat is about gone, they'll pour a bunch of rice on the pan and all of your left over banchan on top of it. After a while, they'll come back to mix it. Leave it heated for a while, and then they'll come back to scoop it in a bowl for you. This ultimate ending is just amazing. This is why having good banchan is so important for Cho Sun Ok, because of this finale. Because it's a stone pan, even when the flame's off, it's still cooking the rice so you get that nooroonji that's oh so delicious and crunchy + tasty with all the extras on it!

2009-11-29,2.0,"I would not brand myself as a Korean BBQ (KB) connoisseur, but when it comes to KB in Chicago, I would like to think I fit somewhere within the ""experienced"" category. I would first like to warn readers about the other good reviews posted about Cho Sun Ok (CSO).  There are not a lot of KB restaurants within the chicago metro area which I believe can be the cause for CSO getting such high reviews.  People who are posting good reviews do not have a valid point of comparison.   Prior to dining at CSO I have heard nothing but good reviews (not just from yelp) but also via word of mouth from friends who have dined there.  A friend and I arrived on a Saturday around 5, right before the peak of the dinner rush.  The place had about 75% of the dining area occupied with only 3 small tables open.  We immediately got seated and were served with water and menu. At this point I did not feel rushed or any sense of bad service. This quickly changed! During our ordering process, my friend (who had dined at CSO before) inquired about the Kim Chi Fried Rice cooked over the grill.  We were informed that we can only order that rice if we ordered one of the Grill items.  We turned to the grill items and asked which item we should order.  The waitress was extremely adamant that we order the ""thin sliced"" bugolgi vs. the thick sliced one.  As I turned to my friend telling him I preferred the thick sliced beef, she interrupted us and inssited that we get the thin sliced one.  Not trying to make her disappointed we went with her suggestion and went with the thin sliced beef (which we later would realize why she was so adamant about it).   Upon finishing our ordering, my friend and I were having a conversation until I was surprised from behind by our waitress who was holding the portable stove.  She placed this in front of me and nearly burned my eyebrows as she ignited the stove.  My friend and I decided to laugh it off as we are not fans of making a scene before our food arrives.  The thin sliced meat arrives and she starts to cook the meat on the pan.  I make a comment to my friend about the amount of grease that the meat has produced while it was cooking.  The waitress had taken the stacks of beef and just threw it on the pan without separating each piece from each other.  We were then greeted with the waitress's solution to absorbing some of the oil. She reached in her apron for a napkin and threw the napkin over the beef and used it to absorb most of the grease accumulating in the pan.  The pan at this point looked like a saucepan of grease with the meat drowning in it's liquid fat.  This was when my friend and I realized why she was so adamant of us ordering the ""thin"" sliced beef.  It was easier to cook (about 10/90 meat to fat ratio) and I am guessing lower in quality.  Each bite we ate was a mouthful of grease.   I quickly gave up on the beef and saved my appetite for the kimchi fried rice which was the initial reason we decided on dining at CSO.  At the time the waitress started cooking our kimchi fried rice, I looked over to the door and realized there was a line that had formed out the door.  It was this moment when one of the other wait staff came by and threw our bill on our table.  Keep in mind, one of our entrees was clearly still in the cooking process which was visible on our table.  I jokingly asked my friend to ask for a menu to get a reaction from the wait staff.  He punked out.  We ended our dining experience with our waitress prematurely turning off our stove that was cooking the kimchi fried rice.  My friend and I wanted to let the rice cook more until the bottom of the pan was burnt and crispy (which is our favorite part of the rice, similar to hot pot bibim bop).  At this point, we decided to wait as the rice cooked on the bottom, but during this process our waitress came by twice asking us to eat.  She came by our table to rush us to eat more than she attended to my empty glass of water.  I was anticipating her third trip around asking us to eat, would be followed by her force feeding us with a spoon.   Korean BBQ can be a truly unique dining experience.  It also comes with a lot of sacrifice, one being the stench it leaves on your clothes, the language barrier with most KB places, and the couple of hours you get to partake in gluttony.  With this being said, it can easily be a terrible dining experience if the service is below par along with the quality of the food.   Pass on CSO!  Spend the extra cash on gas and drive up to the northwest suburbs (i.e. Glenview, Niles) for a truly eye opening experience on Korean BBQ.",0.998,0.851,0.119,0.031,0.5679624542124542

My boyfriend and I arrived on a Friday night around 7, and were subsequently confused by whether or not we should alert someone as to our presence.  We tried to assimilate and not be all American-y and go up to a busy waitress and be like ""hello.  table for 2 please.""  So instead we just...waited.  Everyone sort of did it by the honor system, and when a table opened up a waitress came over and escorted the people who arrived first to it.  It worked out.  Teeny waiting area though.  Not like that's really important. We did our homework about Korean barbecue and this restaurant in particular, so we had an idea of what to expect.  Namely - service that is quick and to the point.  No chit-chat, no reading a list of daily specials, just ""you know what you want?  ok.""  It's just about getting the food to the table, ASAP.  We ordered the Bulgogi, since I've had that before in college and loved it.  The side dishes were delicious - I used to work at  a Korean/Japanese restaurant in college and was delighted to see the familiarity.  Apparently there are a few dishes that are so traditional that they are universal at all Korean barbecue places.  They were all delicious - try every one!  Our bulgogi was wonderful, so deliciously seasoned and tender.  The waitress came over and tossed it in the stone pot at the end of the table, and stirred it around every now and then, but we had fun stirring it around too. When you come here, just don't do anything stupid like we did.  My boyfriend wanted to put the rice in the stone bowl (other tables ordered entrees that apparently come with rice in the stone bowl, instead of on the side like ours).  I was a little scared to do that, since the waitresses seemed pretty serious and like they would not be amused by a foolish American messing up the entree.  He insisted, and I was right: we were subsequently chastised.  Oops.  I tried to hard to act like I knew what we were going, but it was a definite Korean barbecue FAIL.  But you know what?  It was delicious our way, so I don't really care so much. When we were almost finished, the waitress put the check down, and then when we hadn't paid (still eating a little), she came by and tapped the check as if to say ""Pay this please, and go away so someone else can sit down!""  Haha.  So not your typical dining experience.  Again, I would never call this ""bad service"" - different culture, different kind of restaurant, different social norms.  I try to fit in and do what is expected as well as I can when I'm having a new dining experience.  Still, I'm taking a star down not for *quality* of service, but because I didn't feel exactly relaxed or put at ease in this particular environment.  The food though - is exceptional.  I plan to return and try something new, something that other yelp-ers are raving about!  And like, 95% of the people in the restaurant were Korean - and you know you've got it right when the nationals are eating there.",0.9954,0.77,0.155,0.075,0.48112964621585297

Also, it's awkward to get around the tables/chairs, especially when people are sitting in them. I'd say it's worth it though, for the food. I took my family here when they came to visit and they are still talking about how good the yook geh jang was. The service is ok. Sometimes they won't come by for a long time, which is strange especially when it's packed.

2009-09-17,4.0,"During our frequent trips to the North Center area, we've passed a number of restaurants that we have been telling ourselves that we would stop at, but never get around to. This goes for all neighborhoods, but this summer particularly we seemed to find ourselves in North Center a lot. So one Friday after the hustle of the 9-5, we headed on over to a little corner spot on Lincoln, just north of Irving Park Rd., called Cho Sun Ok. I've been hankering for a Korean fix for a while, and this put me to rest. A hobby of ours, as lame as it sounds, is that when we are walking ""off the eaten path, in Chicago"" we tend to stop at as many restaurants as we find fitting just to grab a take out menu. We had stopped at this particular restaurant around the beginning of June to grab a souvenir menu, and were taken back by the joyous aroma of sizzling meat and marinade, and noticed it was ""one of those table top stove"" type of places. This usually means only good things. So on this particular day, we made the trek back to indulge in a little Korean cuisine. We arrived at this BYOB at around 5 o'clock, which seemed to be perfect. We walked in, and were seated right away. Shortly through our appetizer, and from then, on we noticed that there was a steady stream of at least two people waiting to be seated. So I guess we lucked out. As I mentioned, we started off with an appetizer. We kept it simple and order the fried dumplings. We were expecting just the normal 6 piece serving for two, so we were surprised at the plate they brought out, which consisted of about 10 pieces. These weren't anything particular special. They actually reminded me so much of some frozen Korean dumplings that I bought from this Asian supermarket in Schaumberg (at Roselle and Higgins roads) and cooked at home. These were, ehhh, ok, but not needed. Also, prior to the appetizers, Korean restaurants  bring out a large number of small pre-appetizers, the size of tea cups, ranging from seaweed salads, to kimche, to some jelly cakes and sweet potatoes. We didn't think about this before we ordered the dumplings, and could have gotten by with out them. Oh well, now we know. The great thing about this place is that they do dinner meals, meaning that you can order one thing for a group of six, and do family style dining. That seemed to be popular with the rest of the restaurant patrons, so we went with it, choosing the Bulgogi - a mixture of marinated beef, green onions, garlic, sesame oil, and a sugary soy sauce mix. At that point, the waitress sparks up the table top grill, adjust the heat, and walks away. Now that the fire has started less than two feet away from me, I'm sucked into the burning glow sitting underneath the stone cooking slab. I cannot wait to see what they bring out and what kind of smells it will emit. Shortly after the fire is started the waitress comes out with a plate of greens and bright healthy looking, thinly sliced beef, soaking in a dark sauce.  She throws the contents of the platter onto the cooker, stirs it up a bit and walks away. There must have been a down draft because the warm, meaty air was blowing straight onto Lois. I love a woman who smells of exotic foods. Every few minutes, the waitress would come by, toss around the meat, and walk away, leaving us picking at our appetizers, and eyeballing the goodness that's to come. Finally after about 15 minutes, she quietly informs us that it is ready to eat, and we can help ourselves. Lois, never really got the whole chop stick thing down (she's Polish, so it makes sense), so we had to wait while they found the only fork in the restaurant, but once that arrived, we started to dig in. The Korean sticky rice is the perfect substance to eat with this dish. The meat was so flavorful, sweet, tangy, chewy, juicy and hot. Each bite was better than the last. A side note -- we guessed this restaurant was the real deal when we noticed that all but about 5 percent of the patrons were Korean.  In our minds, that gave the food a definite seal of authenticity.  Combine that with some reasonable prices (about $35 for the whole extravaganza) and we had a successful dining experience.",0.9975,0.846,0.121,0.034,0.48145847711065115

2009-08-20,5.0,"I've been coming to Cho Sun Ok since I was a young girl. This was one of my grandmother's favorite and became a family tradition to come here everytime we came to Chicago to visit (about twice a year). Now that I live in Chicago, this is the first place I think to take my parents, friends and co-workers. The ONLY reason to come to CSO is for the ""cha-dol bae-gi"" which is thinly sliced brisket. Chadol is a fattier part of the cow so you'll notice the fat creates a marbel-like pattern.  I've noticed some of the reviews (complaints) about poor service and minor incidents of ""racism."" Really people - Koreans function better when asked. The concept of ""service"" is very American - the only country where people tip the way they do. Anyway, this will be more of a Korean BBQ 101 rather than a review. Once you order, the waitress will come out with a stone grill and a large assortment of traditional side dishes. They'll also bring out side dishes which are meant to be eaten with the meat like the green onion salad, marinated onions, and oil/salt/pepper dip. In addition, they'll give you a bowl of cold greens - I've been scolded many times for not touching the stuff. The waitress tells me each time that it's good to eat with the meat to ensure that the fat and cholesteral come out of your system (I wouldn't WebMD her on that).  Once the stone grill is nice and hot, the waitress will come over and start cooking some of the meat. For the more proficient (or the regulars) they'll usually leave you to your own devices - especially if you look like you know what you're doing. Just a note, when grilling Korean bbq - remember it's the one-flip rule. Cook well enough on one side, then flip over and cook on the other - none of that flipping over 5 times to make sure it's done on both sides.  If you're running low on side dishes, it's okay to ask for more. Actually, it's encouraged - the waitresses will act annoyed, but it's a compliment to them because you're letting them know that the sides taste good! After you're done with the meat the waitress will come by and ask if you'd like stir-fryed rice (bokkum-bap). This is the BEST part. She'll mix in all your left over side dishes along with rice and butter. She'll stir all the ingredients in and let the rice simmer on the stone grill until it's ready. Then, take your spoon and dig in! I've had the bulgogi and galbi at CSO. Doesn't compare to the chadol baegi. I've also had the naegmyun and soondooboo jjigae there - not so great. Just stick with the chadol baegi. $20.95/2 person serving. They give VERY generous portions.",0.9887,0.868,0.107,0.025,0.5438681027966744

2009-08-16,2.0,"This was my first experience of Korean cuisine.  If this is what an authentic Korean restaurant is like, I will gladly take an Americanized place. As other people have alluded to, the waitstaff is, well, racist, to be quite frank.  Maybe that's ok with you and you'll tolerate being treated like an inferior if the food is good and cheap.  Well, I lived in the south for 2 years and did not experience such blatant disrespect.  The beauty of living in the 21st century is I don't have to patronize a racist establishment.  I have choices. Our group of 5 came before a Korean couple, and although the Korean couple tried to advocate for us, the waitress sat them first.  We waited probably 20 minutes before anyone even talked to us (the place was crowded, but still, not even going ask us how many, or say how long the wait is?) Now, let's discuss the menu.  As a Vegan, my choices were greatly limited (disappointing, as Asian restaurants usually have a lot for me).  I told Ms. Waitress that I wanted the fermented bean paste stew (that was one of two things on the menu that did not list meat or seafood).  She basically said that non-Koreans don't like it, and I shouldn't get it.  Um, again, I'm Vegan.  I eat bean stuff all the time.  I was willing to try it.  I told her that I don't eat meat or seafood and I wanted it.  Despite my insistence, she told me to get some other stew, but without the meat and seafood.  It was a little spicy, which was fine, but made me think ""Did she assume I wanted spicy because I had brown skin?""  Anyway, what she and the menu  failed to mention was that this stuff had eggs in it.  WTF?  When she came back around, I told her I didn't eat eggs.  She said, ""You said no meat or seafood, not eggs.""   I told her that I didn't know it had eggs.  She didn't take it back.   So I essentially paid $16 for rice and veggies (we split the bill 5 ways).  I mean, all the little veggie bowls they left on the table were good but man, $16?  Not worth it. The sucky thing about being Vegan is that you can't always do ""authentic"" restaurants.  Such was sadly the case here.  But if you're a Vegan and do go, be forewarned, say you don't want eggs either (they sneak it in a lot of stuff).",-0.9329,0.858,0.061,0.082,0.45432422969187675

Other than that, food is pretty good, price is damn good for a Korean place (and dinner place), atmosphere very good for family albeit kind of cramped and service ok (they seem to not like to pour a FULL glass of water). To you people who say I shouldn't compare LA asian places to Chicago asian places, I ask...why not? Cho Sun Ok is owned by Koreans but the food is made by Mexicans. Sounds just like your typical LA Korean restaurant, why should I rate either one differently. Don't get me started on Asian food in other Midwest cities (I'm looking at you MIlwaukee).

Summary - Cho Sun Ok is an excellent restaurant that will fulfill both Korean and non-Korean's needs for authentic, basic Korean food. Though the menus lacks a tad (due to the fact that some Korean food can be a little TOO authentic for the Midwest palate), it's definitely a place YOU (Korean food lover) should go and a place I'd go back to (and I still do) again.

Know what you're getting into.  The serving staff (most of them have been on staff for years) are trained to do one thing -- take your order, bring your food, and correct your mistakes when you're fumbling at the grill.  If you expected anything beyond that... like checking up on you to see if you needed anything else, or making small chat... you'll be sorely disappointed.  Now, for things that they are trained to do, they are ruthlessly efficient... and they have to be.  It's a tiny join with rapid turnovers, and they've gotten this to a science -- you'll observe they have the optimum number of servers to be as efficient as possible while avoiding colliding into each other in the tiny space.  None of the Koreans will complain, and you shoudn't either.  Ah, and don't be taken aback if they scurry up to yoru table, snatch the tong from your inept hands and throw a jaw-dropping amount of meat onto the hot grill, give it a quick stir or two and scurry away without saying a word.  That's because if you don't keep an ample amount of food covering the grill surface, the au jus will eventually burn and smoke up.   Another misconception is that non-Koreans are treated like second class citizens.  Not true.  The barebones service applies to everyone, young and old, light and dark skinned.  I'm a Korean.  I know.  It's just the way it is, and it's not to be rude, but just how it is.   Enough glowing raves were said about the BBQ, but people also forget about their delicious side dishes.  Yes, these are typical of the fare that grace the table at just about any Korean restaurants, but Cho Sun Ok's are delicate (not salty, sugary or overly spicy), free of MSGs and thoughtfully made.  The ""kimchi in cold broth"" that is served per person that accompanies their BBQ is a good example.  I've known pregnant friends who had cravings specifically for this stuff. Speaking of cold broth, another thing most non-Koreans miss is the naeng-myun.  There's several kind (spicy one without broth, or the one in cold broth) but I'm talking about the latter.  Yes, cold buckwheat noodle soup sounds weird, and it definitely isn't as palatable as our BBQ meat, but it's an indispensible delicacy for the summer weather for Koreans, and Cho Sun Ok's reputed be one of the best restaurants for this in the city.  If you come during lunch hours, you'll see many Koreans happily slurping away with their faces buried in the big bowl.  Hint: you would normally season it up with the vinegar (~2 tbs), korean mustard (~1-2 tsp)and hot pepper paste (optional) that accompany the dish. It's one of the rare places that deserves a five star for its authenticity and the general awesomeness of the food.  For most of my (Korean) friends, this is their favorite restaurants in Chicago.",0.9964,0.824,0.137,0.04,0.6195454545454546
2009-07-22,5.0,"My wife and I ate at this restaurant last Sunday in the late afternoon. I did my homework (thanks yelpers!) so we arrived after the lunch rush but before the dinner rush - even then, it was still pretty crowded but there were a few tables open. We were seated very promptly and given menus. I knew that we would try #6 (the non-marinated beef) and just leave it at that for the visit. For the both of us, it was more than enough food. Upon hearing our order, the waitress moved the burner to the side of the table - *plonk* - and walked away. We smiled, having read the reviews and understanding what we were in for. I sort of felt the same way I feel when I'm in line for a roller coaster ride in an amusement park :-) The sides arrived - very good stuff and lots of it - and then the meat and the onions/jalepe~nos/garlic/paste. What is that paste? It looks like curry paste - were we supposed to use that to cook the meat? Oh well, maybe next time. A giant bowl of salad-like mixture was also brought. I guess that was just actually salad, and we ate it like that. I *thought* I knew how to cook the meat, but after a while of seeing us filling the grill with only one layer of meat, the waitress walked over, grabbed a big mound of meat, dropped it on the grill, and moved it around a bit. So *that's* how you do it. Next time we know. The place was filling up. There were a few non-Koreans there when we walked in, but when I looked up 10 minutes later, we were the only non-Koreans left in the joint (and all the table except the one by the door were full.) The line was starting outside, as we expected it would. So, we cooked the rest of the meat as quickly as possible, and the waitress came over and started the kimchee fried rice.  She let it sit for a while so I let it sit too - I like burnt rice :-) She did come to stir it up once - rice flew around the table and my wife and I smile at each other knowingly. We ate some of the fried rice and decided we'd ""do as the romans do"" (even though the place was packed and nearly every Korean seemed to be really taking their time - especially a table next to us that was filled with senior citizens), so I flagged the waitress. She came over, seemed to acknowledge that we wanted to box up the rest of the fried rice (no more meat left - yum!), then disappeared and was back to running from table to table.  I flagged another waitress about 5 minutes later after not being successful making eye-contact (I guess that doesn't work in the culture or something?) and was clear that we needed our check and our fried rice to take away.  After that attempt, a different waitress came over with a typical Asian food box (you know the kind I mean - like from a Chinese restaurant) and boxed up the fried rice. There was no way I was getting up to walk over and ask for the check - sorry.  I don't mind paying at the register, but I firmly believe that the check should be brought to the table - all cultural boundaries as they are. We paid and left, but not without saying goodbye and having a few waitresses thank us for coming in. I thought that was kind of nice, considering all of the harsh reviews I've read about this place. We had a great time and ate a lot of great food, plus had tons of fried rice for another meal at home.  Seriously, for all you haters - do your research before trying out a restaurant. As said by other reviewers, this place is known for the food, not the service, and you need to understand that it's a ""get in, eat, get out"" type of place before you arrive.  Don't expect anyone to walk you through how to do anything. If you aren't sure, just ""do nothing"" and someone will come to help. Then you will know what to do next time. About food odors: my jeans smelled a bit like food when I left, but not my shirt - not at all. It was nothing anywhere near how smelly my clothing was after we ate at a Korean BBQ on west Laurence that had a grill/ventilation/etc. My advice - if you don't want your clothes to smell like food, keep throwing the meat on the grill and don't let it sit empty or it will smoke. You will have the same problem in your own kitchen - It's not the restaurant's fault if you don't know how to cook :-) Give this place a try - you'll like it.",0.9967,0.856,0.107,0.037,0.4473978758169935

But one can deduce how delicious Cho Sun Ok was to make me make the jump from casual browser to actually getting an account just so I could write a review for this place. We were afraid we could not finish our food so we only ordered the bulgolgi and the spicy soup appetizer. Everything and the little side dishes that they serve in typical Korean restaurants were pretty good. The bulgolgi was flavorful and juicy. The spicy soup was pretty good, but nothing out of this world. I personally like the bbq here better than san soo gab because you get to save the fatty juices from the meat to further flavor your rice if you choose to, rather than let it drip away. There is also less chance of your meat burning or becoming dry as the meat continue to cook in its own juices, whereas in ssg where you have to be on a constant lookout for the meat to not burn or stick to the grill. We actually finished everything and even ordered more rice that there was nothing left for them to make a fried rice after.

And if you don't know what to expect and aren't sure if you should try it, I'll put it to you like this: do you love grilled meat, and do you fantastize about a server bringing out like 30 dishes that look like the stuff the Klingons would eat on Star Trek: The Next Generation? Well of course you do! The dishes I refer to are the ban chan, the many mysterious side dishes that are a part of every meal here. You may recognize one of them as kim chi, but the rest are seriously like sci-fi set dressing. But all delicious. There's one that's sort of like potato salad but has apples in it, I think. Another looks like strips of tofu but I believe it's called ""fish cakes."" I could eat nothing but the fish cakes and walk out of here happy. The many meats you can order at Cho Sun OK are very good, but not the best around (I prefer San Soo Gab San, I find their meat just a bit juicier and more savory.) But the ban chan at Cho Sun Ok seem fresher and more flavorful than any I've had. The jab chae noodles are wicked good, too. You suburban Kraft mac n cheese types might look upon a meal like this with fear and derision. Well, man up, I tell you! For, as the Klingons say, ""Mch'tab keuklich!""

Washed down all that red meat with some selleongtang (beef broth with noodles) and OB  (huge bottles! only $5! win!) We came home with enough leftovers for another meal, all for less than $50 total!

I love Cho Sun Ok b/c I love their mul nang myun which you can ask to be halved into two separate bowls.

That said this is probably one of the better spots in Chicago. The place is uniquely positioned by location to service both the yuppies as well as lincoln square folks. It stands alone and apart from other Korean restaurants in the city because there are actually non Koreans that dine there often.  So while I cannot ever give any Korean establishment a 5 star, this would be deserving of a 4 star if it were not for the simple fact that it is so damn small. There is room for about 30 people? If you are clostrophobic (sp?) do not go. The small space also forces people to stand around the door and wait. If it is cold outside as it often is in Chicago people are always letting a cold draft into the dining area. There is also the annoyance of having people hover over your shoulder while eating if sitting within 5 ft of the doorway.  But the service is better than most other Korean restaurants. It is slightly pricier that other Korean restaurants as well.  I would not recommend for a date since, it is not the place where you will feel intimate nor have the luxury to eat slowly and talk. This is for a quick hit of Korean in your belly and you are out the door. If you get tried of the Chadolbaegui grilling then go for the soups. I always get the yukgaejung.

Here are some things that I have to say to non Koreans that dont understand this place or any Korean restaurant. 1. No one is intentionally trying to be rude to you.  Korean waitresses are known for being rude to non koreans because non koreans have the habit of lingering after their meal and they expect to be babied throughout the process when you know damn well the restaurant is packed full of people.  2. In all my years of going to this place I have never gotten anything except the chadol (thin slices of beef).  Dont get the bibimbap here they arent known for that.  Each restaurant is known for a certain thing.  If you want good Kalbi goto SSGS etc.   3. The owner used to be a beast when it came to foreigners.   I've seen him kick people out.  This is going back to #1 on my list.  Dont piss the guy off I want him to live and hopefully in 10 years I will be able to take my kid there.   4.  If its your first time there I highly suggest taking a Korean who is fluent in Korean and knows their cuisine.  Do not take an Americanized Korean they will be of no help to you.  I've personally witnessed this on several occasions.   i dont know if yelp has a mail function but you can email me questions if you like.   I may be a bit blunt but this is coming straight from the horses mouth.",-0.9252,0.846,0.058,0.096,0.49832010582010583

My guess is that the bad reviews were due to the people not knowing what to order. I decided to go with the bulgogi (marinated beef) and had no regrets. The meat was very tasty.

I will say that I spent an EXTENSIVE amount of time doing research before heading here since it was my first time at a Korean BBQ or Korean restaurant in general. I read almost all the yelp reviews which were incredibly helpful.  We got there at 7:30 on a Friday night, even though I know that's one of the busiest times. There were only two parties ahead of us in line, but we did have to wait for about 40 minutes for a table since the place is so small. I was pleasantly surprised about the decor, though. From the outside and from some reviews, I was expecting it to be pretty sad looking. I actually thought it looked relatively clean and nice, though it is very small.  When we sat down, we ordered the unmarinated beef strps for 2 since that's what I heard was their specialty. The server brought out the 10 bowls of assorted veggies, etc. and was definitely not interested in telling us what they were or if there were directions on how to eat anything, so we just started picking at everything and I was really happy at how good they all were. The beef was brought out and the oil on the cooking stone was smoking, so still unsure what to do, we just started throwing some meat on the grill. Eventually a server came over and seemed perturbed we'd started on our own, but not in a mean way. She threw more meat and the garlic cloves on the stone pot and really got things cooking for us. She did show us how to eat the beef (dip it in the sesame oil/salt/pepper mixture, pick up some shredded scallions and some marinated onion/jalepeno stuff, cram it in your mouth). It was delicious.   We stuffed ourselves with the meat and they came over to make the famous fried rice. I was so sad that I really didn't like the kimchi fried rice. It must be the kimchi because the flavor was just nothing like I'd expect from fried rice, and I didn't really like it. That's just my personal taste though. Don't go expecting the fried rice you've had anywhere else, cause this ain't it. Otherwise, I loved the experience and am planning to go again with a couple more people. It's a good place for small groups (4-6) and a fun experience to share. It's also BYOB so the bill ends up being so small for all the food you get!

The décor is traditional Korean?  I can't really speak intelligently on the interior design philosophy of Korea. My only experience consists of a 3 hour layover in the airport in Seoul.  However, the design of Cho Sun Ok is what I'd like to think would be typical in a Korean restaurant in Korea.  The service was ""prompt"".  Is prompt a good word when trying to really mean a bit rude and trying to rush us out?  I've been Cho Sun Ok several times before and this type of service is  what I'd consider par for the course.  If you can put up with ""prompt"" service and smelling like beef after your meal then Cho Sun Ok is for you.

With that said, I believe this place has the worst service imaginable for a restaurant that is as popular as it is.  Why is there no line system at this restaurant? Isn't this 2008? Must all Korean restaurants be completely oblivious to the fact that Americans demand good service? I only go there for the thinly sliced meat and it's awesome. An order for 2 is extremely affordable and their food is authentic (I'm Korean). I've tried other things there and it's all very good.  This place can easily be 5 stars and I think I could've given it at least 4 stars but that's only if you can overlook the very thing that almost every Korean restaurant do... lack of good service and their ability to speak english.

Also, if you're planning to try this place for the first time, read below. 1. make sure you know your place in line. Otherwise, there is a chance that you will be cut by random Koreans that bully their way in. 2. If you get the Cha Dor beef (order for 2), make sure you're continuously cooking if the waitress isn't doing it for you. If you don't throw more meat on there, the stone pan will start burning and you'll have a face full of smoke.  3. Finish cooking ALL of your meat. If you somehow get full and feel the need to not cook all of it, wave a server down and tell them you're done... otherwise they will just leave you there and never come back. Cooking all your meat is a sign for them to finish you off by making fried rice in the very same stone pan you were cooking your meat in.  4. Don't get mad if the wait staff seems to be annoyed.

Sometimes you need to remind them 3 times that you want some Coke because they're working on a million things. (Sidenote: They don't serve Mountain Dew. My friend came and wanted MD and the lady asked him 'fried or boiled' because she heard 'mandoo' i.e. dumplings. I got a kick out of it). - Your breath will probably stink afterwards. The complimentary gum or lollipop that comes with your bill won't cut it. My friend's convinced only special people get the lollipops.  - There's a parking lot behind the place with Korean-only signs. Free parking for the Koreans... us non-Koreans just manage to find street parking. - Sometimes the wait gets ridiculous but it's worth it. Food: - Cha-dol Gui... a huge platter of beef that you cook on the stone plate. Tons of meat for two (I think it's only $25). If you're inept at cooking it, the ladies will take over. I like eating it with the oily/salt dipping sauce and the 'grass'. After you're done grilling, they dump kimchi rice, and some of the side dishes for nice kimchi fried rice (great for bringing home and eating at 3am). I like it when it's slightly crispy/burnt which can lead to a war with the servers because they like to turn the grill off = no crispy rice! - Sides. There are tons of the free ban-chan. One reason to love Korean food! - Haemul panjun (seafood pancake). I always love my haemul panjun. Unfortunately sometimes they don't cook it as well.

2008-03-20,4.0,"I really enjoyed my experiences at Cho Sun Ok.   My first visit I went with a friend (Korean, to boot) who helped me understand a bit more about Korean food a culture.  I had experienced Korean barbecue in the past but I think it's much easier to get into it and really understand what's going on when you're with someone Korean on the first go around.  It also helps avoid issues that can arise with the language barrier... that is, if there is one.  I was THE ONLY non-Korean in the very full restaurant this first time, which is always a ringing endorsement for a Korean restaurant! The chadolbaegi is really delicious, I enjoyed it immensely.  I do prefer a charcoal grill over the hot stone dish which can make things uncomfortable if the grease builds up and starts splattering (I lost a few arm hairs that night).  The meat melts in your mouth, absolutely delicious albeit a bit greasier.  The banchan (small side dishes including kimchi, potato salad, fish, seaweed, etc.) is tasty and plentiful and fills up the entire table.   Service is rushed, but it's typically 2 or 3 women running around like crazy because the place is packed.  The joy of cooking your own food is that it's a pretty self contained experience once you've got the ingredients.  Jump right in there and start cooking when they bring the meat over, otherwise they might think you don't know what you're doing and start cooking for you.  What fun is that?  Besides, they don't have time for that shit!  My last visit, I enjoyed a LARGE bowl of bibimbop for lunch.  I was going to take a picture before I devoured it but it was way too good looking and I forgot.  I have uploaded a picture of the food, I took it when I was about halfway done. With this HUGE bowl of delicious fresh vegetables, beef and a fried egg came a bowl of rice to mix in, hot sauce, 4 banchan (korean potato salad, seaweed, potato & sweet potato and some tangy kimchi) and all you can drink water.  The price?  $10 covered food, tax and a 20% tip.  Pretty damn good for one of the most filling lunches I've had in a long time.     I also tried out some of the Korean I've been practicing. As with anywhere else, if you speak the language you open doors.  I think my server got a kick out of me ordering and thanking her in Korean (I'm big, white and kind of dopey looking so I don't think she expected it).  About halfway through the meal, with me still speaking as much Korean as I could muster, she started passing things to me with her right hand, with the left hand on her forearm, as is common (I believe) etiquette.  I found this interesting because I have never experienced this at this restaurant or any other until I tried out my language skills.  I wonder if there is a connection?  Anyone care to guess? Overall, a great restaurant that I have grown very fond of over the past month.  I'll definitely make it part of my routine from now on!  I just recommend you prepare before you go because I think ANY Korean BBQ restaurant can be a little intimidating if you don't know what you're doing. Steve L.'s review reminded me -- the panjan (seafood pancake) is really good, I highly recommend checking it out but it's awfully large for just two people, if you plan on eating everything else that is on it's way out!",0.9988,0.773,0.191,0.036,0.5524231950844853

First of all when you walk in it feels like you're in Seoul, lots of tables that are close together in a small place, creating a very intimate atmosphere. The food is served as it should be with lots of little side dishes called Ban-chan. You can get a meat dish to share for I think $22 but don't let them push more food on you than you can eat, those dishes that are supposedly for 2 people can easily feed 3 or sometimes 4. First the meat comes out and gets grilled and you eat it with rice, side dishes and lettuce(?) leaves and then after that it seems to make a whole 'nother meal when they stir fry the rice for you in the left over meat sauce with spicey flavoring and vegetables.

There's a side dish that tastes like potato salad that I love from here. It's a great experience cooking the meat with a group of friends. If you take too long to cook the meat, one of the ladies will come and speed up the job for you. It's cute.  Unfortunately the service isn't fantastic. If you are used to just drinking water, it takes them awhile to come around. You'll have to ask them to give you a refill. I suggest ordering all your drinks once you put in the initial order.

People like korean bbq and the neighborhood has changed. Service - is the worst I have ever seen. People chalk it up to thats how a Korean restaurant is, but that should change!!! There is 1 waitress there that gives you so much attitude. Its either her way or keep getting more attitude. What ever happened to the customer is always right? Ask for water and time how long it takes you. Better yet ask for anything and see how long it takes. I am a Korean american and I will tell you that they treat people differently there. They try to rush certain people out, by coming over to your table and dumping 1/2 a plate of meat you paid for on the pan to get you to leave faster!!! Why our table and not the other one - we have been here the same amount of time?  Seating - what is up with the seating?! Clean up the restaurant a bit and offer your customers comfortable place to eat. What is up with the bar? They have one... can you sit at it? They should offer the poeple waiting out the little door a drink or a place to sit. During the warmer season do you see them put patio chairs out for their customers to sit? Do they ask your name and put you on a wait list so you know who is next or do you sit in that line because your scared you will loose your place? I am complaining because I am sick of these Korean restaurants not knowing how to run a restaurant and treating people so badly. They need to learn that they are in the hospitality industry and that is what they should offer. Respect is earned - John C talks about the korean society and being respectful and the patriarchal society, but hell your paying them money for their food and you have to respect them in order to get service? I am all for respect your family, friends etc, but come on... This is a restaurant! Do you think that you would go back to any other place if you were treated in this fashion? Do I need go to a Sushi house with a Japanese person to get good service or do I need to take a 1/2 asian 1/2 french person to a fusion restaurant to get better service? That makes no sense on what these people are saying.  I really do not recommend this place at all. This is no comparision to any bbq place in NYC or LA. They need to do better! They need to focus on the customer. Put out a patio chair - get a busser to bring water to the tables not have your customers dying of thirst and have to wait 20 mins for a refill.

2007-01-13,4.0,"PLEASE READ IF NOT KOREAN or USED TO KOREAN CULTURE Holla at a Korean Brother!!!  Okay, sorry...I'm not really into the whole Korean culture, I mean I was raised in Macomb County in Michigan!  But I do know the food...why?  Because I ate all the nastiness when I was growing up and my momma (uhmma) is one of the best Korean cooks hands down yo!  Many say she should have opened up a Korean restaurant.   So anyway, I would like to make comments on the comments of others concerning Korean restaurants.  These are my opinions and my thoughts...so don't come yelling at me.  I'm just trying to give some non-Koreans perspective.  I'm like the ""Dog Whisperer""...trying to make you understand these weird people called Koreans.  My wife also isn't Korean, so she gives me perspective on my culture and asks questions about why Koreans are a certain way.  So I've been forced to verbalize my answers.   1) Decor - Yes Korean restaurants aren't big on decor, but you also don't pay for it.  My theory is that many Koreans come from humble beginnings, so what you see is like a F-ing palace compared to what these people probably grew up with.  You know that same old story...I came from a poor country, with $30 in my pocket, worked my ass off for my family, and now I provide for them.  So who cares if the restaurant isn't all that great looking.  I don't know anything about the owners, but I can relate to my own parents.  I mean they have a super nice house in nice area, but inside it isn't that great.  They don't spend the time to make it is a nice as my wife's parents house on the inside.  They just didn't figure it out, but compared to what they know, it is awesome.  Weird.  My dad had no money, we were poor for a long time, and he made a life for us.  Okay, maybe I'm full of sh*t, but whatever...that's my theory... 2) Service - Remember that Koreans come from a very hierarchal society.  Older above younger, male above female, etc.  This is something my wife can not grasp.  Why do I listen to my older brother even if it seems weird?  Why do my younger cousins bow to me?  Why is my mom the ultimate source of right/wrong?  But then my dad can trump her?  Well, again I'm generalizing, but remember that this is the way the old country was...it is less so now even with the gender.  So, put yourself in these peoples shoes.  They are used to bossing the younger around, telling people ""lower"" on the chain what to do...NOW they are taking ""orders"" from some younger person...sometimes that person doesn't understand the culture so it seems that they aren't respectful.  For example...younger people should receive with two hands...a sign of respect.  So you don't know this...you just expect this waitress to do things for you...we are a proud people.  I'm not saying it is right/wrong, I'm just saying see it from their eyes.  They may not like it, they may need the work whatever...try to joke with them, try to be respectful, you'll see a difference.  So my buddy goes here ALL the time and his Korean is horrible, but he is respectful to these waitresses.  They love him now.  It is just DIFFERENT. 3)  Food.  Almost all Korean restaurants specialize on one type of food.  I think the Galbi is just okay here...eat at Solga for Galbi.  For Cha-dol Gui...eat here!!!  It is the best.  Non-marinated with all the trimmings.  Close to restaurants in LA.  You can order other dishes, the hot pots, etc.  But you will probably find other places that are better.   4)  Getting a Table.  This is a challenge for all people, Korean or not.  Knowing the owner definitely helps....sometimes.  Some people probably called ahead or they know the owner.  They also spend a lot more money there and are proven customers.  I was pissed a few times, but my friend talked to the owner and he explained.   5)  THE STANK!!!!  Korean BBQ places stink...your clothes, hair...it's like smoking a cigar.  Your whole body stinks.  What is worse...if you eat the garlic...well let's say a vampire won't come close to you.  Wear clothes that DO NOT NEED to be dry cleaned.   My review.  I love coming here.  I don't have to go all the way to Lawrence, and I think all the food is okay.  The Cha-dol Gui is great!  I ranted and maybe I'm full of sh*t...whatever, just trying to give you perspective.",0.9927,0.802,0.126,0.072,0.5055438842203548

2006-11-25,5.0,"I've been to ""Cho Sun Ok"" about 5 times and it satisfies my craving for some good Korean ""bbq"".   Sometimes I think only Koreans can put up with the intricacies of this place ... but it's always a good sign to see Koreans packing this place up and waiting in line out the door to eat here. First off, you'll have to know a bit about most korean places.  Most korean places look like crap .. inside and out .. and I think Koreans aren't much for aesthetics.  If you want your traffic signs on the wall, old b&w pictures, catchy pop music, sports memorabilia, vintage do-dads, etc. go to fridays/applebees/potbellies/etc etc etc.  That being said, I think this place is pretty decent looking compared to most korean joints. Also, what you won't get at most Korean restaurants is friendly service.  This place is no exception ... there's no time to be friendly here.  They're understaffed and it quickly becomes standing room only(and out the door) during popular hours.   It's almost comedy watching the waitresses hustle back and forth, table to table, trying to keep up with the grilling and orders.  It's not like they're intentionally being rude or anything though, it's just insanely busy here and you're gonna get the basics .... no jokes or quips, no conversations, no smiles.  (oh .. and everyone gets the same treatment here, korean or otherwise ... unless you personally know the owner or slip a Benjamin to him during a handshake you're just like everyone else.) Tip #1: ask the owner (older korean guy standing around the bar) for the check when you're done, instead of wating for the waitresses to come by. Tip #2: Ask for plenty of water with your INITIAL order placement. So if you've made it this far you're in for a treat.  I usually get the ""cha dol bae gee"", which are VERY thin slices of beef.  They'll put the fresh meat out on your table and come by to cook it on the stone skillet on the table.  Sometimes if the waitresses are busy (always?) you'll have to do some meat turning yourself so it doesn't get too burnt.  You'll probably find yourself spreading the meat all around evenly  on the skillet only to have the waitress come by and mess it all up to cook it ""the right way"" like some of the other reviewers have said.  The meat is so good ... Like some of the other reviewers have said, avoid the lines and get there early ... and you might have dogs chasing you if they get a whiff of your clothes when you get out of there. Anyhow, the food here is really good and you'll be hard pressed to find a better Korean restaurant in Chicago.  So relax a bit while you're here, don't expect to get treated like a king, and just enjoy the food and atmosphere .. because despite some of the gripes about the service you'll find that there's more personality here than most restaurants .... without the need for vintage memorabilia hanging off the wall.",0.9952,0.807,0.143,0.05,0.5002491694352161
