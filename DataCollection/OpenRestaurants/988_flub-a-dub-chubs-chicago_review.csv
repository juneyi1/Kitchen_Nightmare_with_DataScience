It tasted like a good dog. I of course had a salad instead of tater tots. It is a cool place. It is down a narrow stairs  and looks like dog places looked in the early 70's. It has a TV and is just comfortable like a buddy's basement. They have burgers and make your own burgers but since I wanted a dirty dog, I cannot comment on them.

2017-05-28,2.0,"Discovered this joint and have ordered it many times through Uber eats. The first two times it was outstanding. Unfortunately, it hasn't been made right the few times after. Recently, my husband ordered it at 515 pm and it didn't arrive until after 645pm or so! Uber eats made some sort of error and the restaurant cooked it at 515 so it sat there forever with no one picking it up until I made a call saying where is the order?! They fixed the delivery problem but the restaurant didn't remake the food! Omg they delivered my husband food that sat out for over an hour!! I can't believe it. How upsetting of the restaurant to serve food that could possibly make someone sick.  Fast forward to today. We tried it again. Why? Oh why are we so forgiving?! Well the fries were all messed up. They tasted like they sat out for a long time and had been way over seasoned. Not the perfect fries I had the first two times. And these $8 mozzarella sticks were served to me burnt and black! Omg. I don't understand how that is acceptable.  Upon calling, the man didn't seem very genuine after we've given his business maybe $150+ over the past few months. This place isn't very cheap. He tells me it'll be redelivered. Not true. Instead Uber eats is liable... And I have to wait 24 to 48 hours to know what the decision is on the order being inedible.

The staff were friendly and answered my questions about other items like, was their red onion marmalade the same as the onions that nyc hot dog stands used. It wasn't.  While I was waiting on my food, they looked up and printed the recipe to the onions I mentioned. We had funny convo about. They joked about putting it on their menu in my honor. Lol.  Also, I stopped in FADC after leaving the supermarket across the street and had purchases in my hand (yeah, I refuse to pay 7 cents for a bag) they were kind enough to give me a bag for free.

2017-05-08,1.0,"Visited this establishment based on the Yelp reviews on a Sunday evening with my husband and a friend. My friend got the BLT dog and fries. My husband and I both got the pulled pork dog.  I really don't understand the hype about this place at all. I only gave it two stars because the food wasn't terrible, it was just average, and I wouldn't visit again. After tax and tip, it was $18 for my husband and I to each have a pulled pork hot dog with no side. This wouldn't be a terrible price if the food was good. However, while the hot dog was cooked well, and the bacon gave the exterior a nice flavor and crisp, the pulled pork it was topped with was most definitely not made in-house, and was really bland. It tasted like microwave pulled pork you can get at the grocery store, and had a near slimy consistency. We both ended up taking the pork off the top and eating the hot dog.  My friend got the BLT dog and french fries. The fries were extremely salty, and nothing spectacular, just your average frozen french fries.  My husband actually had leftovers, and wanted to wrap up his hot dog for later, however the cook and the person working behind the counter were nowhere to be found. Stood at the counter for five minutes waiting for a piece of foil or SOMETHING. The cook finally showed back up right as we were leaving the restaurant, however the person working the counter was still nowhere to be found. I understand that we went on a Sunday evening, however when you have several customers (there were other people eating, not just us), you probably shouldn't disappear for 20 minutes. Expected so much more from the reviews. We will definitely not return. Overpriced food for what you get, and was nothing you can't get at any other hot dog place in the city, and done much better, in my opinion.",0.9851,0.885,0.108,0.006,0.5523809523809524

Anyways, the owner was really nice about explaining the menu to us and the food was prepared and ready in less than 10 minutes. I ordered the flubby with tater tots and cheese sauce- the beef sausage was delicious and I really liked it. I just wasn't a fan of the Chicago style, as it was overwhelmingly sour (just take my review with a grain of salt on that recommendation). Tater tots and cheese sauce were great and it made me reminisce on some good high school lunches. Overall, I can see why so many people like this place.

2017-04-18,5.0,"Absolutely wonderful!!!  I got the two hot dog deal with vegetarian hot dogs with the works and fries for $8.95. This was my first Chicago dog and I am converted! Fries were great, buns were incredibly soft, the pickle was perfect, and I just loved the complex flavors in every bite! I did not put ketchup on my dogs, but the fries were perfect with it. Crisp, fresh, hot, flavorful, delicious. I got two because I'd seen that price in a review here and thought ""what a deal!"" - but I definitely only needed one dog for a full meal! I am not a milkshake person at all, but after reading rave reviews on here, my friend and I decided to split one. Easily one of the best milkshakes I've had in my entire life! The owner was proud to tell us she made it herself and that the secret is great ice cream. I believe it!!! Every sip was like drinking chocolate cream! [heart eyes emoji!] The owner deserves a special shout out. She was conversational in turn with letting my friend and I eat in peace, then checking in with us. It was so obvious this restaurant is a labor of love and she knew everyone who walked through the door (other than us, of course!). We came at 12:30 on a Monday and had no trouble getting a table, but I can easily see the joint filling up quickly. The ambiance of underground, locals-eat-here, old style diner (complete with red and white checkered tablecloths and customer-drawn art on the walls!) was so appreciated. I loved this little hole-in-the-wall space with the personality to boot! I would EASILY become a regular if I didn't live across the country. PROS: Awesome local ambiance. Real hotdog tasting, perfectly textured, delicious vegetarian hotdogs. The flavors were great. Plentiful portions. Tons of options. SUPER reasonable prices. AMAZING MILKSHAKE!!! Owner is a perfect host. And, honestly - the name. What's not to love?! WISH I HAD: Next time, I'd definitely ask for more pickled peppers on top so every bite can have their delicious zing.

During, the weekdays the place is run by a couple obviously in the throes of  first love and the front of house suffers.  If there's a cook on duty, all is well.  If not,  I no longer go in.  BUT TODAY!  The short order cook was evidently in the throes of a nervous breakdown, throwing things around yelling that he does everything and perspiring profusely.  The cook disappears.  Okay. It's not the first time this has happened in a restaurant.  The owners are completely ineffectual at handling the situation.  The husband proceeds to shuffle about in the kitchen area and finally an order goes out.   The cook returns, observes  the mess in the kitchen and begins raving again.  He looks at what is evidently the beginnings of my order and makes angrily declares that it can't go out this way.  In the middle of all this, a problematic homeless man comes in.  Now I've observed this before.  It happens in Chicago.  But there's already a crisis.  What does the wife do? She selects that very moment to ban the guy from the restaurant.  I'm certain it's deserved, but at that precise moment? Then arrives the calvary, the couple in love.   One is dressed  deliciously inappropriately in  short shorts and the other possesses that happy go lucky.  He briefly attempts to restore order in the kitchen, the cook has disappeared again, but gives up to supervise his better half.  My order sits.  I think the cook returns again. , but he's certainly  not in a better mood.  I finally decide to leave and I discreetly tell the owner to forget about it.  My goodwill is such that I don't care about $17.00.  I distinctly hear the wife say, ""Don't follow him, he doesn't need to be that way!"" WTF?  I work 70 hours a week, I don't need this melodrama.  I'm not shy about demanding my money back, I deliberately decided not to make a bad situation more unpleasant.  The horrifying aspect of this entire situation is that I think they were clueless about how bad the situation could appear to people.  I cant go back now.  Melodrama, love birds, unstable cooks.  It's the stuff of reality shows and I don't need it in real life.

The devil out here taking L's for this one.  The hot dog was so PERFECT I almost cried when faced with the fact that it would soon be a thing of my past; Sad times. I ordered some chili on the side, which I had big plans for once I got the hotdog down. When I did, I poured the chili onto the tots, and BAM! - the second coming!!!!! All of it was perfection.  The atmosphere is a hot dog stand; not much to describe there. The place is run by an ADORABLE older couple and they are SO sweet and super personable. I loved them. They checked in to make sure everything was tasty, which it was. The husband even offered to change one of the TVs to whatever I wanted to watch. So sweet!

My only gripe is they always ignore what is written in the specifications section when ordering online. Ask for no tomatoes? There will be tomatoes. Ask for no toppings whatsoever on your sandwich? All the toppings. Not a huge issue for me personally but it could be a massive issue for someone who has food allergies. If someone were to be allergic to something on a burger (let's go with tomatoes), request it come without it but the burger arrives with tomatoes?

It took me about 15-20 minutes to find the entrance (I had no idea what the other reviewers meant by ""Look Down"" -- I thought this referred to some sort of hidden relic on the floor of this establishment. This would have saved me some agony), so needless to say, I was STARVING when I entered Flub A Dub Chub's. I ordered a Chubby with fries and a soda, and service was quick and friendly. I liked the Wall of Shame and the fan artwork -- it gives this joint a really down to earth feel. No pretense. No frills. Just good food that speaks for itself. My first bite was HOT! It feels weird to say that I was overwhelmed by a hot, juicy wiener in my mouth, but yes, essentially that's what happened. *blush*  I can't say much for the flavor because I think I burned my soft palate and part of my tongue, but it was nice and chewy (not rubbery at all). The fries were a tad salty for my taste, but nice and crispy.

Burgers and hot dogs come with fries, but I subbed the mozzarella sticks.  You can taste the beer in their beer battered mozz sticks, which are surprisingly not super greasy.  The onion rings are also amazing.

Brought a group of five to Flub on Tuesday night and we did it right--my wife and I split a Flubby (the ""normal"" sized hot dog with fries) and the Bryan Burger (cheddar, chili, pretzel bun, fries, 8-oz. cooked!!).  Incredible.  One of the best hot dogs I've had in Chicago, very close to the dogs I have had at Devil Dogs and Franks N' Dawgs in terms of quality.  Because the dog is a little bigger than a normal dog (1/6th of a pound), the toppings on a normal Chicago-style dog don't completely freakin' overwhelm the thing. The burger was hilariously massive...it's nearly a pound when you account for all of the toppings, and the chili on this thing was magic.  The fries are also perfection and the food comes to you in 10-15 minutes, just enough time to be both excited, angry and ravenous. My three friends were all making the eating sounds of happiness while going through their assorted dogs and fries also; great service and the place was quiet on a Tuesday night, which was very accommodating for my eight-month-old!",0.9832,0.778,0.176,0.046,0.6030864197530865

2014-10-13,4.0,"This has become my favorite place in Lakeview for a burger. The food is just phenomenal. My favorite is the Greg's Hangover burger. The burgers are very juicy and the buns are always fresh. The fries are also delicious but the portion is very small for what you pay for. The food is always high quality and it is truly greasy goodness. The hot dogs are pretty big, not the normal grocery store size. If you are in the mood for greasy goodness, this is a great place to go! I live about two blocks away, but often get delivery due to work demands while working from home and not having time to get up and go pick it up. Delivery is usually very fast and convenient. I highly recommend this place if you are in the mood for some greasy but delicious fast food.",0.989,0.749,0.227,0.023,0.658157894736842
2014-10-06,4.0,"I got the Roe Burger which comes with cheddar, bacon, avocado and fries on the side for $9. Burger is huge, I would guess it was 1/2 pound of meat. It was a great burger, the quality of the meat, toppings, and bun was all very high. That is a very good price for a burger of this calibre in the area. A similar burger from Kuma's Too or Rockit Bar would be more like ~$14 and I don't think that they are any better. The only complaint is the fries which are truly mediocre- there's no crispiness at all, they are basically mashed potato sticks. Bleh. I also tried the quarter pound hot dog which is also great, one of the best hot dogs around, and also a steal at $5.25 including fries. Unlike most chicago-style hot dogs you can have one of these and feel satisfied. You won't be satisfied by the fries but what you can do, no one restaurant can win them all. 4/5 based on quality and value of the burgers and the hot dogs. If they started making french fries competently it would be an undebatable 5/5. I don't know what they're doing wrong maybe they are skipping the blanching step or the second frying step but their fries are an insult to the rest of their food.",0.8639,0.81,0.121,0.069,0.6520277777777778
2014-09-28,4.0,"The place is a total dive.  The door handle is sticky.  Nine times out of ten, that's a red flag. But your burger will be a giant, juicy meat explosion in your mouth, and that's a very good thing.  I ordered the Samburger (cheeseburger) and added bacon.  It's on a pretzel bun, which automatically adds to its awesome quotient.  You can customize your burger almost any way you want. Fries are included, though you don't get many of them.  They're quite good.  Of the larger variety (similar to Wendy's size). I'm tempted to say there's a draw between Flub a Dub Chub's and Five Guys just a little further north on Broadway.  Five Guys is less meaty, but you'll get way more fries in a regular order.  So if you want a burger but crave a ton of fries, go to Five Guys.  If you just want a monstrous burger, but don't care if they skimp on the fries, go to Chub's. I only wish they were open later.  This would be most excellent drunk food.",0.8712,0.85,0.111,0.039,0.5320757020757021

We thought preparing this type of food would have been a lot quicker, especially since we were the only ones there.

All and all though, the food here is terrific. The meat used here is top notch, and I knew it was going to be special when they asked how we wanted the burgers cooked, b/c you normally do not get asked that at your typical fast food hot dog joint.  I guess the only thing I can say in terms of fast food was that it did take a bit longer than a normal. But man was it worth it.

LOL now it makes sense.  So I went up to the counter and explained that we were out of towners and didn't realize ketchup was a sin.  He said it was OK and that they would leave one of the dogs the way we ordered.  When we got them both were Chicago style HAHAHAH.  We found it funny and cute.  He swore it wasn't done on purpose.  Thankfully they did make them both Chicago style. Those were the best hotdogs I've had in a long time.  I was very happy.   The guy at the counter, I believe his name was Dan, was a super nice guy.  He gave us some recommendations on places to go, drink and eat.  I love getting recommendations from locals.  Thank you!

The night we ate here I experienced something that rarely happens. I had food envy so bad that I am pretty sure I turned green. I hate cheese on burgers, plus I was craving a Chicago dog so I did not really look twice at my hubbies cheeseburger. Until the smell hit me. Oh lawd. This damn burger made my stellar Chicago dog wimper in shame. It tucked its tail between its legs and scurried off, allthewhile I stuffed my face with my husbands dinner.  This is crazy. Not only do I usually make the better food choices (ha!), but the fact that this little 'underground' place serves up TWO righteous items is just beyond me. The dog is snappy, garlicky, salty goodness and makes this one of the best I have had. Still I go back to the burger; this cheesy hunk o cow might be the best burger I have had. Hot damn.  You know, even their fries are good. If you want ketchup for fries, that's one thing. Just don't think about putting some on your Chicagodog. It's sacrilege, and you WILL be punished. It was a little disappointing that they charge for sauces, if I want to dunk my fries in some mayo I don't think a restaurant has to be so stingy to charge for some. I guess I can play devils advocate and turn that one around to myself, maybe I'm just weird and cheap. Or both.  Anyway, you have to come check this place out.

It is with a chubby that I confess my doubts and ask forgiveness from the Windy City. Ahem, enough with the theatrics - Flub A Dub Chub's is awesome. It's tiny, with just a few small tables inside and couple more outside on the sidewalk. It's sparsely decorated and you might even call it a dive. None of that matters, because the dogs are top notch. The flubby with the works (and accompanying fries) was a life changing experience. In the past, the only place I would willingly eat a hot dog was at a baseball game or anywhere that offered it with chili and cheese, but in both of those cases, the dog didn't really matter. In the former it was about convenience and the experience of being at the game, and in the latter it was really about the chili.  Not so at Flub A Dub Chub's, despite this dog being piled high with more (and weirder) toppings, it's all about the dog. Spicy and in your face, the mustard and onion get your taste buds warmed up. Up next the sour and salty relish, pickle, and sport peppers get them turned up to 11. Fresh cucumbers and tomatoes punch through with their cool freshness. Finally you arrive at the celery salt, subtle and just noticeable through the myriad of flavors, it binds everything together like the banjo in a Mumford and Sons song. Each of these elements works together to highlight the delicious 100% beefiness of the classic Vienna hot dog. If you're normal human hungry, the flubby is plenty, especially because the fries are delicious. Super hungry?

If it is your first time (like it was ours), you will totally miss this place. Flub A Dub Chub's is this cute just-below-street level hot dog joint. I kind of felt like I was walking into a Cheer's type of place except I know everyone would not know my name! This hot dog restaurant is small, but has a lot of heart and charm! The owner is a humble guy who treats his customers like his own family, at one point in ordering I wanted to say thanks Uncle and give him a hug!  I ordered The Flubby- 1/4lb dog with Relish, Pickle, Celery Salt. I also violated the house rule of no Ketchup going on a hot dog (sorry guys this little Southern California gal loves a good dog with Ketchup, next time we come by I promise not to add any)!   We also ordered Seasoned Fries to share as well! We found a table and sat down. A couple of TV's had on the Summer games which didn't catch my attention because I was too busy looking at all the artwork that was posted all around the room from local visitors to international ones. Each was unique and had great praise for this place!  Word to the wise if they catch you red handed with ketchup on your dog, get ready to be put on the wall of shame. Thankfully, the hot dog gods were watching out for me that day! While waiting for our dogs to come out I also realized their motto:  ""Come in hungry, Leave with a Chubby"" I was lost in thought, pondering if I would indeed have a chubby after, when my bubble was interrupted by the nice owner bringing our food to us. Before leaving our table he placed one hand on both of our backs and said enjoy. I do not think I have ever had service like this before. It was sincere and genuine. I was quite impressed with my hot dog, it was freaking huge! Sinking my teeth into the first bite, I was a little worried that I might not like it (not really a fan of casing on a hot dog) but that extra snap makes it worth every bite.

2012-09-28,4.0,"So I wrote this really bad review today about burgers from Rocco Ranalli's, which I only settled for because Flub a Dub's was closed last night.  That burger was so revolting that it left me still wanting a burger this afternoon (sorry, heart health).  So, having been too lazy to get to the grocery store today, I decided to get myself a Flub a Dub burger for lunch.  The experience could not have been more diametrically opposed to that which I suffered from Rocco's. I will still try their hot dogs later, but after eating the Roe Burger today, I am surprised that Flub a Dubs is a hot dog joint first, burger joint second.  The burger was fantastic.  High quality meat, cheese, and veggies (especially those flavorful tomatoes).  I am always skeptical about avocado from places like this, but even the avocado did not disappoint.  Nice pretzel bun.  I particularly appreciated that the fries were packaged separately from the burger, and thus retained their crispiness and flavor.  So many places skimp on quality of ketchup, too, so it was nice to see that Flubs takes it seriously and brings Heinz.  As may be hinted by some of my other reviews, I am a bit of a sucker for mozzarella sticks... these were also excellent.  Many places have horrible breading and mediocre marinara, so it was nice to see that Flubs doesn't use the bread crumb breading and that the marinara was more than just a flavorless red sauce.  I loved that they deliver via bicycle, and it sure helped that the delivery guy was friendly and that they delivered in half the quoted time.  So, for now, let's say it's a 4+ star joint, with serious potential to be a 5 star joint.  My only complaint would be that for a place that isn't too expensive, a $15 minimum order for delivery is too high.  All I wanted was a burger, but in order to get above their minimum, I had to order mozzarella sticks, two cokes, and a gatorade.  That sucks, imo, but at least I know that I've got some really excellent sticks sitting in my fridge for later (and their sticks are pretty cheap at $4).  If you haven't yet, go check this place out, yelpers.",0.9827,0.792,0.133,0.076,0.604297052154195

The other one has glasses and sort of an angry, aloof hipster thing goin on. He will ignore you until you are standing at the counter. He doesnt come off all that friendly but really I dont care. I just want my food. That being said he is way more johnny on the spot with getting you your order once it has been cooked.  The mom is extremely nice and very sweet but I havent seen her in a while.

Plus, the burger was easy to cut, very conducive to sharing :) The hot dog was just a good ole Chicago dog with errythang, and I particularly enjoyed the lime green relish.

2012-04-03,1.0,"I, as the rest of my family, have been loyal fans of this place...Why?,  you ask? My answer, ""They have tasty & burgers that  are served on a pretzel roll!""...""Duh!"". I am saddened to say, that we (our entire family & as many people as I can speak with), will no longer be ordering from this establishment. Why?...you ask? My answer, ""Not because of their delicious food, or their wonderful owner, Sam""...No, no, no...all because of his rude, obnoxious, & ill mannered nephew...DANI or DANY or DANIIEL! In this economy, as a business owner myself, it s important to deliver excellent customer service and top quality products.  On this dayus, I decided to order the BOCA burger versus one of their other choices. I asked for Giardiniera (Sotto Aceti in Italiano) on my BOCA. Instead I had a BOCA burger delivered, yes I payed for delivery, with their version of this Italian topping...only their version was more of a Mexican version, consisting of only Jalapenos (No celery, zucchini, carrots, cauliflower, or OLIVE OIL)! When I discussed this issue with ""Dani"", I not only heard laughter in the back round, but also dealt with the lack of responsibility on their behalf to make things right. We were devoted ""clients"" of this establishment, but when you have an ""employee"" (and I'm using that term loosely), who belittles you, puts words in your mouth, makes jokes on their mistake, and treats you like a piece of #*&$!,yes this happened after being a loyal customer in this horrid economy. Instead of taking responsibility, he basically stated ""My hands are tied""...may I also mention that Dani stated that the current batch of Giardiniera was made incorrectly as has received several complaints, but yes folks his HANDS ARE TIED! Really Dani, your going to risk your uncle's business by being a pompous human being (I'm also using that term loosely)?  I hope more people can realize how small this city is, and also realize how one bad review can spread like wildfire...especially when you have homes in both the city & the Northshore suburbs,,,that's just in Illinois. People can sometimes be well connected, these are the times I think of the Joan Crawford scene in ""Mommie Dearest"" as she is addressing the boardroom, with that famous line ""This ain't my first time at the rodeo""...tisk, tisk, Dani!  I simply wanted him him to say ""sorry Sir, We appreciate your business, may I offer you a replacement...I truly do apologize for OUR mistake""...instead I got arrogant tones and blood boiling comments. By the way Dani, the real Italian Giardiniera does not use Jalapenos or any hot peppers...now the American version to which you probably meant ...uses peppers, but not Jalapenos, it's either Serrano peppers or crushed red flakes...BTW! Thank you for trying to correct an Italian foodie.  Only after being hung up on, mentioning to email the owner, and giving him an earful,..only and only then did he suggest to refund the item (not the entire order) fully if I were to come to the establishment with the item...So I paid delivery for what reason? Hmmmmm....No, Dani you come and pick up the order and make good on your UNCLE'S business and products. Not to mention he tried putting words in my mouth, sorry Dani, I'm a little (just a little) more astute than you. Look up the word if you don't know what I mean. I decided not to continue the irritating conversation, instead I left Sam a message on his phone. All I wanted was a BOCA burger, I did not even want a refund, mistakes happen right? So for future reference, take note Dani, do not think your above your customers because in this economy all that matters is your reputation. If you worked for me, nephew or no nephew, you would find yourself in the unemployment line tomorrow morning. As a business owner, there is no way I would have a pompous jerk running my business...Sorry Sam I (We) will truly miss your food and your smile.  Did I mention I am part of seven organizations in Chicago, of which I am a major donor of. Wrong person Dani to #%@$ with.  All in all their food is awesome, but DANI is disgusting!

The right way, what's that you ask? Well, I can only speak for myself, but avacado can be sorta slippery, so I think it needs to almost be spread on a burger like a thick sauce.

The place is easy to miss since you have to go downstairs and its sandwiched between two other businesses. I wish there was a larger sign so others can enjoy what I did. I only found it by doing a yelp burger search. A burger acquaintance of mine who lives just around the corner had no idea what it was or even heard of it.

The burgers were cooked perfectly, juicy, and came with delicious fries that I was not expecting them to come with. The Roe Burger comes with cheese, bacon, and avocado while The Bryan Burger comes with chili, cheese, and a giant onion ring. I've had chili cheeseburgers from other places but this has been the best of all and is the one I liked better between the two. The burgers were also served on these amazingly soft and tasty pretzel buns which enhanced the whole experience. The icing on the cake was the wonderful and hospitable owners. The owners I believe are an older couple and they were just very sweet. They asked us if we wanted to change the channels of the tv to something we wanted to watch and they made sure we enjoyed our food and started up small conversation.

Some do caricatures of the hot dog, or some make funny theme or setting involving a hot dog. All of this adds to the fun and feel good environment Sam and his staff provide.  The dawg is everything you've grown to love. But he uses slightly fresher ingredients and he goes the extra mile by using that sausage size Vienna Beef dog.

If you're a Californian and you love your In-n-Out, you're going to have a tough time competing with this one, but thank goodness they've only got one shop in the good ol' midwest. Flub-a-dub chubs, that's not just the name you say, but how your lips and you belly feel after you have one, if not  the tastiest, angus burgers around.  And as is Chicago tradition, ""hold the ketchup,"" because you're not going to taste this patty right with all the condiments.  It's truly a mouthful to behold. If you enjoy their food you'll love some old Chi-town hospitality if you get a chance to meet one of the owners, Roe.  She'll treat you like family when you walk in the door... good and not estranged family.  One thing that you might figure out is that it is a little hard to find.  Your eyes aren't fooling you if you see Flub a Dub Chubs on a sign a little closer to the street since this little mom and pop is underground.  You may have to pay for a little street side parking, but it will definitely be worth it. It was a little worse for wear when I went out to visit since it was raining pretty heavily the night before we came, but that didn't some the service from being superior and the food, outstanding.

The restaurant is TINY and it has a great mom-and-pop vibe to it. We all decided to try the burgers, and I went with the Roe Burger. The burger was served up on a buttered and slightly toasted pretzel bun with fresh guacamole, lettuce, onions, and tomato, as well as being smothered with some cheddar cheese and bacon. The burger was cooked at medium, but it seemed to be cooked moreso to a well-done consistency, as it was a little dry. Regardless, it was still extremely enjoyable, and you could tell it was made with quality ingredients. The fries were cooked to perfection and were a great compliment to the burger. We all shared a side of onion rings, and these were phenomenal! The batter was very flavorful (and thick) and it made for one of the better onion rings that I've had in awhile. My only complaint is that it took about 15 or so minutes for our food to be done, and it seemed a little unorganized, but to their defense it was a busy Saturday afternoon and this shows that your food is actually made to order.

We went in on a hot Sunday night and were able to sprawl out, as only a few tables were occupied.  I went for the highly touted burger and fries.   The guy at the counter was very helpful and even served the food to us at our table.  Nice touch.  It's rare to see service like this at a fast food burger joint.   The burger was huge and had a nice char to it (I ordered it medium well).  How does it rate?  I don't think it's better than Portillo's, quite honestly.  However, the fries were remarkably outstanding.  I'm giving Flub the honor of best fast food fries in the city.   The one thing that detracts from Flub, or any self-anointed ""authentic"" Chicago hot dog or hamburger joint, is the stupid ketchup thing.  They keep the ketchup behind the counter at Flub and shame you if you ask for it on your hot dog.  If you want ketchup on your fries, it's okay but you have to ask for a little container of it.  The poor mustard container sits on its own so the customer can himself load up on it.  But who would?   The whole ""no ketchup"" thing in Chicago is as stupid as continuing to re-elect Daley; the planters on LaSalle, Randolph and Madison; red light cameras; the entire City government; the entire County government; and the election of Rahm, whose first royal proclamation was a giant lie about what happened on Memorial Day.  Expunge all of these things, and you immediately have a much better Chicago.  Rant over.   The burger is better than M Burger's and maybe Five Guys' burger, but it's still not as good as Portillo's.  Make sure you order the fries.  They are without a doubt top.  Oh, and don't do what Weiner did.   It's 3 1/2 stars.",0.957,0.762,0.138,0.1,0.6575555555555556

I remembered a couple of friends had come to Flub and said it was one of the top 10 burger joints in Chicago, so we went for it.  It's a place that you wouldn't be able to spot from you car, unless you were searching for it, because it's one of those basement food places. Since it was near closing, there was no line, which was nice. After perusing the wall menu for a couple of minutes, I ordered Greg's Hangover (bacon, cheddar, fried egg) and my boyfriend got the Bryan (chili and onions). The burgers come with fries, and we asked for a side of melted cheese.  The staff was really friendly and delivered our food to our outside table (it was a nice night for being out). The fries were fresh and well-seasoned, and the burger was huge and delicious. The pretzel bun was a very nice touch, and our burgers were cooked just the way we like and tasted great.  So, why four stars? First, their wall menu is a bit tricky (at least at first glance) because you can see all the names of the foods, but until you move closer, you can't really see what is actually on the burgers. Second, and this is probably just my own personal ""thing"", but after my burger was done, my hands were rather shiny with the grease that had soaked the bottom bun. Could have been from the burger, the bacon, or the egg. But still...I wasn't too thrilled to have that much grease on my hands and scrubbed pretty vigorously with napkins to get rid of it.

Saturday, past 9 pm, and I'm eating a hamburger alone.  I know what you're thinking but I'm not available.  This is exactly the burger I had been pining away for all day. I went in and looked at the menu. By ""looked"" I mean there was some TV on and I stood in front of the menu while I watched TV.  Then I stupidly turned to the counter and said ""can I get a burger with cheese, like a cheese burger?""  (low and behold they have such a thing on the menu)  And while I waited for my Samburger (that's a cheeseburger for you laypeople) I watched ""My cat is from Hell"" on TV, and knew I was better off for not having a television because I probably would have gone home with my to-go order and watched that mess on my own tv(while eating in bed).  I ordered fries too because I remember hearing good things on yelp, and they were pretty solid. A little too much salt for my tastes, but I probably wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't dropped them in bed as now I have to roll around in it all night.  The Roe is the kind of burger I typically crave but I just felt like something simple tonight. Sometimes bacon and avocado detract from the delicious flavor of beef and cheese no?

This came to $12 and some change, he never mentioned to him that he still had money on his $15 voucher (strike 2), so I mentioned it and suggested he add a bowl of chili. Which he did and then owed him $1 and some change. Hubby paid, my turn.  I ordered a Hangover burger, onion rings, a bottle of Water and a bowl of chili. Came to about $18. Not the cheapest but could be worse!  Took our food to go, fries were ok but desperately needed salt and seemed a bit stale, onion rings were pretty good but also needed salt. Cheese sauce was bland and tangy all at the same time which is not a good thing and we were missing an order of fries.

U-turned, and drove back down, and could not find this extremely well reviewed burger joint in this nice, artsy ""Santa Cruzish"" part of Chicago.  So I parked, and went where my GPS told me to go, and there it was, in a basement. You walk downstairs from the street.   I enter to find only a few table, with stools, 1 with chairs, and one young guy, mid-twenties, sitting behind a makeshift counter to take the order.  The menu - A chalkboard.  Simple.  The signs around the place: Handwritten on computer paper.  Printed pictures adorned the walls, and the remote to the flat screen was on our table, to abuse as we please.   I ordered the Bryan Burger (chili, onion rings, and cheese) while my burger mate ordered the Greg's Hangover (Bacon, cheddar, and Fried Egg).   Now, I have eaten at some of the finest burger establishments in the world.  This would definitely be a top ten burger place in my opinion.  The burger was cooked perfectly to my order of medium rare.  The chili was awesome, and the overall combination of the ingredients was mouth watering.  I'm getting hungry just remembering it.  The fries were awesome, and then came the best part. Drew!  The counter guy.  Let me tell you something:  I hate when I go to a burger place and try to decide on an order by talking to the counter person, only to find that the 16 yr olf minimum wage vegetarian behind the counter acts as confused as an Amish electrician.  This guy knew his burger.  He knew what was good, and he knew other great worldly burger chains.  I literally sat there and talked burger speak, and felt like I was talking to a fellow connoisseur of the Patty.  He definitely made the experience that much better, knowing this was a burger by burger lovers, for burger lovers. If your looking for the next froo-froo upscale 1/3lb all healthy toppings burger joint to try....

The interior of Flub's is quaint.  A few high bar tables and chairs.  There were about 7 of us and we took up most of the seating there so I wouldn't recommend it for a nice sit down place to go to but the food is so good it'll keep your mind off of the lack of seating and space. We ordered three different burgers and shared them as a snack.  Our local friend told us we would have one of two reactions: the first... it's a solid burger; the second... it would be life-changing. Although I love hamburgers I was already full and not particularly hungry... I say this because if I can rate a burger this high even when I'm not hungry then it's a pretty spectacular burger! I was more than pleasantly surprised by our burger and fries.  The owner was kind enough to give us extra cups for drinks even though we had only purchased three meals.   My favorite was the one with avocado in it.  OMG so scrumptious!!  The fries were nothing special in the sense that they were just fries but they tasted excellent!  Hot and crispy!

Likes:  The pretzel roll style buns are probably my favorite part of what Chub's has to offer.  I also love their fries, nice & salty, hot, & crisp.  The burgers are hearty & made with angus beef, which is always a plus.  They're a great size too, hard to finish, & with the fries included with every burger, the $6-8 price tag is a real Chicago steal!  I love that you can order online, though the food is so cheap & hearty that it's hard to fulfill the $15 minimum by yourself.  I also must mention that the customer service is very good, and they've really taken care of me when I was there.  They also often have special bargain prices on certain weekdays.   Dislikes:  The place doesn't overwhelm you with its class, which makes a dine-in experience less than excellent.  It also has a very limited dining room capacity.  You can order delivery though, so I won't knock them too bad for that stuff.  I also do not care for their onion rings at all, and the burgers, though tasty, are very greasy.  I won't knock em much for that either though, since it is a burger joint after all, but when even your bun starts to get a little soggy, that's not good.  If there was one major menu change that I would like to see, it would be adding a dessert.  At most places, you can at least grab a good cookie or an ice cream sandwich, so Flub A Dub's falls a bit short there, having no dessert menu.

About the food.  You can pretty much get ANYthing on your flubby (hotdog) or your burger, and they offer a variety of other things like chicken strips, tamales, fries, onion rings, etc etc. My recommendations:  For hotdogs, try CREAM CHEESE with grilled onions or fresh tomatoes.  I know it sounds odd maybe, but it's freakin' delicious.  Make sure you ask them to grill the bun.  These toppings are a standard in Seattle (where I'm from) and serve as a nice twist on a classic food.  Cream cheese isn't listed as a regular topping yet, but they usually have it. For burgers, get the ROE....bacon, avacado and cheddar on the Flub's famous PRETZEL BUN.  yummmm. A great neighborhood establishment that I recommend to everyone I know.  Even when my mom visited for the holidays, I took her there once and she suggested going back again a couple days later!

2009-10-28,5.0,"This place, and the name, make me happy.  So I decided to write an essay about it. ""My Visit to Flub A Dub Chubs"" by Damian C. Amanda, Justin and I were walking down the street known as Broadway on an unusually sunny, yet chilly, August day.  The three of us had clear agendas and plenty of time to kill since we called off... err... did not have to work that day.  The sun was just starting to tip over the side of the brownstones lining the sidestreets.  The combination of mindless chattering and hours of walking led to one thing:  EXTREME RAVENOUS HUNGER.   ""Gosh, I am so hungry, I could eat a cow!"" Amanda said as she strolled at a pace twice that of Justin and I. ""If you are hungry enough to eat a cow,"" I said, ""then a cow is what we will eat.""   We continued on our path in search of some delicious beef.  Then, out of the corner of our eyes, buried just below the street level, stood a red beacon of beefy hope, joy, and greasy deliciousness.  That beacon, my friends, was Flub A Dub Chubs. Our eyes wide and our mouths salivating, we made our way into the depths below.  Justin flung the door open first and we followed suit into the restaurant.  The owner welcomed us into the small burger basement with walls covered in photos and flare, patrons two-handing their burgers with smiles all around, a television flickering, light conversation.   ""Welcome!"" he shouted from behind the stand as he directed us towards the food menu.  ""Gosh, everything looks great,"" Justin said as his eyes frantically scrolled the board of tantalizing options.  Cheddar, bacon, avocado, chili, peppers, PRETZEL BUNS... there was no comprehending the little miracles one could create!  ""For today only,"" the owner said, ""a free soda is included with your meal!"" At that point we all cheered; who doesn't love a free fountain pop?! The three of us each placed an order for the ""Roe"" burger, chock full of cheddar, bacon, and avocado.  ""No avocado for me,"" I told the owner as he took note on his pad.  ""And I'll have mine medium-well!""   A few minutes later my basket, filled with seasoned fries and a medium-well piece of Heaven sandwiched between a soft and salty pretzel dream, arrived at my table.  From pictures you can see how beautiful these little dreams look, but to have one in front of you will bring tears of love to anyone's eyes.   The three of us sat at our table, napkins in hands, crushing the burgers and licking up the last of the crumbs.  ""I don't think I've ever had such an amazing burger!"" Justin exclaimed loudly for all the passers-by to hear.  ""Each little bite tastes like angel kisses flowing down my throat and throughout my body!"" Amanda chimed in.  I attempted to offer my two cents to the group, but all the angel kisses in my stomach made me too full for conversation. Within minutes our baskets were empty and our stomachs were bursting.  We cleaned up our table and took our plastic symbols of fulfilled appetites back into the restaurant.  As our time together was winding down, we made a pact to frequent this establishment regularly.  As we made out way out the door, the owner yelled, ""Have a great day guys, and stop back in again soon!"" I believe that I have found the best no frills burger in Chicago right in the Lakeview neighborhood.  I spread the Good Word of Flub A Dub Chub's to friends and co-workers each day and invite them to experience burger-greatness like my friends and I did that fine day back in August.   The End *Not only are the burgers amazing, but it is locally- and family-owned, and that is another thing we can all smile about.",0.9963,0.817,0.138,0.045,0.5106876993973769

I walked in with my friend Jim and we were some of the first to eat there.  They didn't have menus up yet or anything, it was practically empty.  Nevertheless, we made fast friends with the owner Sam and his son Brian the chef.  I went in for the kill, tried a classic chubby (1/4 hot dog).  It was fantastic, really.  Ample, with great fries and raspberry iced tea on draught so I was smitten immediately. I invented the Locastro.  That L in my name?  Yeah, it's Locastro. Over the next year I would go on to eat a Triple Chubby*, the Locastro** and the Locastro PRIME*** as well as a few Bryan burgers and chubbies here and there.  The food has been consistently awesome.  The fries come out hot, the burgers are juicy and full.  Owner Sam, his wife and son make up about half of the staff, and they're a hoot and a holler.  It's the kind of place where you feel like you could get to know the people serving your food.  And that's SPECIAL.  How many times do the reciept slingers at McDonald's ask you your name, and greet you with a smile and a ""Here, change the TV to whatever you want!"" I'm totally serious, I'M Locastro. It's been a year since opening and the food just keeps getting better.  Expanded menus, Brian is offering soups now and the photo wall has grown and grown.  Chub's is the kind of place where you can always expect a good meal, no matter what you try.

The seased fries were crisp and good, but hard to pay attention to after I had just gobbled up a giant burger. The burgers are big, but flat, so it's easier to bite into.

""Flub a Dub Chub"" is the name of a children's book written by friends of the owners. You want to think other thoughts, that's your business.  On the food: the basic hot dog - the Flubbie - at this joint is a skinless wiener about 25 percent larger than your standard hot dog. The Chubbie is larger and thicker, and has a skin. In my view, the Chubbie is too big to work as a hot dog, because it overbalances the condiments. It would be great charbroiled with a little mustard, but they don't do char. You might want to ask for the Chubbie on a roll rather than a bun.  The place serves two excellent variations on the Italian sausage sandwich. The Polish is also good, but not up to the sausage. The bratwurst is your standard weisswurst, nothing special. The hamburgers are a notch above what you might expect - better than fast food, not as good you would get at some of the bars around town. I haven't tried the Italian beef. The corn dog is very very good, probably the best you'll find. Drinks are standard issue soda fountain, some Pepsi, some offbrand.  Early on they had a pepper & egg sandwich, but I haven't noticed if it is still on the menu. If they have it, & if you like them, these are pretty good.  They usually run a special of two Flubbies with fries for two bucks more than the price of one. And recently, they have had a chilidog listed which is excellent, and which I'm sure you can get even if it isn't listed: chili, mustard & raw onions. They ladle on the chili, though, so if you want to hold your dog rather than eat it with a fork, tell them to go easy on the chili.  The fries are excellent. They are neither thin nor thick, cut with the skin on, and are salted with some kind of seasoned salt which is pretty good.  The place is clean & well lighted, with a television & recently added jukebox. There's some street seating part of the year.  The owners - father (Don, I think), mother (Rosemary) and son (Brian, the cook) - are usually all there, and are very nice people. They are intent on your getting what you want, and if you don't, just tell them & they will fix it. This is a nice hot dog joint, small, but among the best.

Be aware that the dogs come with fries so make sure you alert the cashier if you wish to go a la carte.,0.9443,0.807,0.177,0.016,0.5590277777777778

We walked down the steps and ordered our food (the fries were phenomenal and hit the spot entirely) from the nicest guy ever working the cash register. After the two CPD officers we were sharing the restaurant left, he gave us the remote to the TV so we could turn off Animal Planet and put on whatever we wanted to. Nice! The food was so good, this place is SO ""Chicago"", and the design of the inside makes you really feel that too.

Bring in the dirty Boystown humor to eat with you.  With this I am recommending you to read their shirts for sale that take their establishment's name to a new level: ""Came in hungry and left with a chubby,"" ""My boy/girl friend gave me a chubby,"" ""God chub?,"" ""Chub on board \/ (arrow pointing down).""  There is also a mirror FULL of customer's marker notes, autographs and love at the entrance and two ""Wall of Shame"" posters presenting gleeful ketchup+Chub customers in photos.  ""Heck, Hotdogs don't have mustard!""

And no online menu to enlighten me of any potential veggie alternatives. But I was craving some carby and meaty goodness of a bright and shiny hole in the wall joint. And what do you know? They DO have meat free options other than deep fried potatoes, cheese and assorted vegetables. Which means Boca burgers (not my favorite) and veggie dogs. I went with the Chicago veggie dog, sans mustard (is it still a chicago style? I didn't ask for ketchup land me on their wall of shame).

2008-06-18,3.0,"The never ending conundrum of Yelp stars. Flub A Dub Chub's is your basic hot dog stand. Having given Hot Doug's four stars, can I give FDC more than three? I think not. And while I can appreciate the fondness with which people view this establishment, I can't award that fourth star. There's a lot to love about Flub A Dub Chub's, starting with the name. How can you not smile when you say it? And the guys who run the place are great. They're a father-son combo, with a LOVE for the dogs. While I was there, the son -- who isn't fat yet, but will be if he keeps eating like this -- said he had had a corn dog for breakfast, and was looking forward to a chili dog for lunch. Finally, for those of you who care about this sort of thing, they love the kids. The menu has a maze (""Help Flubby catch the Chubby"") and a word find puzzle on the back, and a friend has written a children's book about their adventures. (""They have capes. They have courage. They have to be in bed by nine."") But what we're really interested in is the food. The dogs are good, just not spectacular. The Chubby is a quarter-pound dog, which is a heck of a dog. The Flubby is a bit smaller, at 1/6 pound, and the difference is in girth -- it's not quite as chubby. All dogs come with the standard Chicago toppings -- mustard, onions, neon green relish, tomato, pickle, cucumber slice, sport peppers, and celery salt -- and if you ask for ketchup, your photo is placed on the Wall of Shame. Which is as it should be. All sandwiches come with seasoned fries, which have just the right amount of kick, but you can leave off the fries and save a buck. This worked out for me, because I had both the corn dog -- crunchy coating with just a hint of sweetness, complemented nicely by mustard -- and a flubby, since I didn't want to invest in a full-out chub. They also do burgers, Italian beefs, and a handful of other sandwiches. The decor is a little low rent, but clean. It's an easy place to miss, since it's located in the lower level, beneath the astrologer. There are a few tables with stools, and right now it feels pretty stark. It didn't help that on my visit, there was a bunch of trash along one wall. Not garbage, but construction stuff -- some drywall, architectural fixtures, jugs of cleaning products. It did not add to the ambiance. The paint job is red and white, and the white walls add to the feeling of it being cold and incomplete. Sure, these are niggling concerns, but I didn't find it a comfortable place to eat, despite the warmth of the staff. If you're in the hood and looking for a quick bite, FDC could be the place for you. They have some outdoor seating for the summer months, which is great if you feel about the decor as I do.

But they don't, and to me that is sacrilege for a Chicago Dog.  * updated to 5 for just being so damn tasty The Chub is a whole hell of a lot of hot dog, no one needs more than one... let me make the mistake of ordering two for you.... 2 Flubs and fries is perfect for a growing boy or girl, and comes with complimentary cinnamon hot dog gum.  Family run business, uber friendly, rarely busy, a proper dog, maybe my 3rd favorite in the city currently... and that says a lot because I consider myself a Chicago Dog lover. How do you know I am a lover? I capitalize Chicago Dog.  Stop in and check this place out if you are ever in that neighborhood, and if you don't enjoy it, you can blame me.",0.5383,0.739,0.138,0.123,0.5535714285714285
2008-03-08,5.0,"Great hotdogs (and they know enough about true Chicago hotdogs to never, ever put ketchup on it, unlike some hotdog joints around town -- oh the horror, the horror). Good prices. Clean, bright, friendly, unassuming. The owners sincerely want to please and pay attention to the customers. They ask you how you like the food, which is nice, and you get the feeling they really care what you say.  The place looks like an old-time Chicago hotdog hole-in-the-wall, the kind I grew up with in the late '60s. Very cool, brings back the memories. This neighborhood needed a good place dedicated to hotdogs. I hope it succeeds.",0.9932,0.573,0.392,0.036,0.5778125
2008-02-29,4.0,Not too much to say about this place honestly. For the money the food is great. I really enjoyed the italian sausage that I ordered there. They do seem a bit scatter-brained there - unable to keep track of who ordered what (or even what you are ordering while you are actually ordering it) but overall the folks running the show are pleasant so who cares. For a quick bite that is incredibly cheap this place is great and I'll definitely be going back.,0.9774,0.743,0.257,0.0,0.46904761904761905
2008-02-18,4.0,"Positives: Very friendly staff, tasty fries, and tasty burger.  I can tell they're trying to make this a hang-out, like it's your livingroom.   Cons: I ordered the burger with bleu cheese, avocado and bacon.  I think it was called the Roe Burger or something.  It sounded interesting, I was soooo hungry and I love avocados.  When I got home, I realized all I had was bleu cheese.  I must say it was a tasty bleu cheese burger, but I didn't get what I wanted. Final: I'll probably stop by again, mainly since it's on my way home from work.",0.7047,0.856,0.114,0.03,0.6166666666666667
2008-02-13,5.0,I stopped in my first Chub experience during the icy conditions of this past weekend and was greeted by some of the warmest people I have met on the block.  I was craving a hot dog like no other and since this place's adorable sign and brightly lit store front has been calling my name since it opened I knew it was the night to try it. The menu was huge so I decided to go for a classic Flub (regular size hot dog) and cheese fries.  The hot dog was great!!  Tons of Chicago style toppings and enough celery salt to taste (my fav)!  The serving of fries was HUGE and crispy.  The cheese was also very good.  And all that food for a mere $5.  The best part of the experience was the super friendly owners.  A husband and wife team that chatted me up about the neighborhood while I waited the few minutes for my food.  I will definitely be back for all my quick bite cravings!,0.987,0.749,0.214,0.037,0.5238517279821627
2008-01-22,5.0,"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! The food is pretty good but it's the service that will keep me coming back.  The minute you walk into the place you feel welcome (and it's not in that annoying ""just leave me alone please""  way).   The chef son is so adorable in his ""all about the food"" kind of way.  The first time I went in he gave me a free sample of his chili and it was soooo good and I'm not that big of a chili eater.  About a week later I brought a friend with me and mentioned to my friend how good the chili was....again free samples ot both of us.  But it didn't stop there, as we were waiting for our food the mom/order taker was talking about how her new vice was the chili cheese fries and we said that sounded good.  As Brian (I think that's the chef son's name) was putting together our order he ""upgraded"" our fries for chili cheese fries - on the house.   Their service has made me a regular.  Now I just need to not get fat from those chili chees fries.",0.9949,0.735,0.248,0.017,0.5702667702667702
2008-01-18,5.0,"These guys are pros. It's a miracle what they do with a veggie burger at Flub A Dub Chub's! I'm totally serious. Delicious!!! Also, there are tons of toppings for your burger or dog- even giardinera! And they coat the fries in Old Bay, I think, which makes them super duper yummy.  I'm picky and I know when a sandwich is made with love- these guys take the time to do everything right.",0.9676,0.735,0.246,0.019,0.6115079365079364
2008-01-05,4.0,"The moment I walked in, I knew this had to be a family-run shindig, because there was loud talking, laughing, knee slapping, and all around good-time having. There isn't a menu posted just yet -- this place is freshly open and still has a few kinks to work out (such as coat hooks, they said, not to mention a kid's menu, which is also in the works).  The son is the cook (chef, that is) and the dad saw the place on a whim while looking for hot dog's in the area. The joint used to be a massage parlor, imagine that!? So they picked up the place and decided to do a hot dog thing. The wife/mom is a teacher down on the south side and she was doing a little bit of waitressing/order taking while I was in there. The overall atmosphere is jovial, friendly, welcoming, what do you want me to say!? The moment you get up to leave it's ""Goodbye!"" and ""Thanks!"" I mean, this place is no bigger than a shoebox and had about six bar-stool style tables as well as a diner-type counter along the wall with bar stools. It's done up in red and white like you've entered a circus tent of hot dog goodness. But what about the FOOD? I, like Rocky, got the chicken sammich (also known as the HYPE-Kat). The hot dog just wasn't sounding comfy to my rumbly stomach, so I went the safe route. They'll do the sandwich any way you want it, too, with any toppings, that is. The guy who came in after me -- who must know the folks who run the joint as he was participating in the knee-slapping goodness -- ranted and raved about the hot dog. I mean, The Chubby is, afterall, a QUARTER POUND dog with the works. ""THIS, he said, THIS is a real hot dog!"" And don't let the price fool you. It might be 4.75, but it COMES with fries.  And the fries? Freaking amazing. They have this delicious seasoning on them, too. My only gripe is that I didn't get ENOUGH of them with my sandwich. Next time? I'll order extra, that's for sure. The coleslaw was sweet and shredded, and although it didn't amaze, it satisfied. Afterall, this is a hot dog place, not a cabbage house. The menu (of which I stole one) is filled with hot dogs with wacky names like The Mr. Big, The Bryan, The Flubby, The Lars, Double Chubby, and The Peppy Pepitone. They also have burgers, which are half-pound steak burgers with pretzel buns. There's also a few specials there, including Greg's Hangover with Cheddar, Bacon and Egg. And if you're hankering for an Italian beef, they can fix that hunger too. You can also pick up cheese fries, chili, cheese sticks, and sodas. They're straight-up Vienna franks here, though. And finally, a word from some other folks who wanted to be heard. There were a couple fellows there with what I can only assume were their children, two little girls. The girls were chowing down happily, and although one didn't dig the fries, it turned out the little one is a fry-hater, so take what she says lightly. The guys loved their dogs and their only complaint -- Chub's doesn't do poppy seed buns! And guess what? They don't plan on it. So get your arse down to FADC. Support the local eatery, enjoy some television, say hello to the fam, down some fries, and buy a shirt when they come in. I know I'll go back for a dog pretty darn soon ...",0.9932,0.861,0.107,0.032,0.557936507936508
2008-01-04,4.0,"Oohoohooo, just got back from Flub A Dub Chub's and I just have to say they are a great addition to this strip of Broadway. Friendly service, cute little diner like atmosphere. Seating is barstools and high tops. But let me get to the food... I order a chargrilled chicken sandwich. Sorry, I forget the name of it on the menu as all the items had these cool little names. I got it with the works and they also tossed on some avocado and omg was it ever good. Served on a pretzel roll. It was messy and tasted like it had just come off of someone's outdoor grill. The chicken is also a nice thin juicy layer, not some big fat piece of white meat that is so tough and dried out you need tons of mayo just to be able to swallow it without chocking. Yum! Fries were crunchy and greasy...mmm, just like mom never made.  If I had remembered to grab a menu I could have listed some of the items they are offering but off the top of my head they have... Hot Dogs Hamburgers Chicken Sandwiches Fries Chili Fries & Mozz Stix Go check 'em out. Do it...you won't be sorry and hey...you might even get a little chubby. ;)",0.933,0.857,0.116,0.027,0.6595512820512821
