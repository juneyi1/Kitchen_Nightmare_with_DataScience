Given the Benedict is called out and it's $22 for crab cakes I expected a LOT more crab meat. And the bread for them didn't seem like muffins. More like toast?

2017-07-12,4.0,"First impression:: My fiancé is from Chicago and has wanted to try this place for a while. We were walking around the city and needed a rest stop to grab some beers and food.   Since it was so Nice outside, the patio to the Gemini looks so inviting. We were a little late for lunch so there was no crowd outside but there were several people who were happy to help us. Food/Drinks:: We had dinner reservations so we only wanted to grab a snack, and at first glance the menu items are a bit on the pricey side. But the plates are so beautiful and they taste so good that it is no doubt worth the price.   They had an amazing beer list and our waiter was very helpful with my selection as there were a few that I had never tried. I had the Maplewood Charlatan ($8) and my fiancé had the Left Hand Sawtooth ($7).  Both were very tasty. Mine had a lot more flavor and a great hobby finish. I wanted to go with a logger because it was so hot outside, but he is shirred me that this would still be a refreshing choice. The food on paper looks great. My fiancé and I had no trouble in both picking the same two starters we wanted to split. Duck Confit Nachos ($17) & the Greek Lamb Meatballs ($15).  I'm going to post the pictures of our food but on first to look they are super tiny compared to the price. I have had nacho plate for way less that are at Mountain.  But honestly the food was so good!  I took my half of the nachos down in one by each because it had the perfect amount of pepper, cheese, avocado that you need while The deck was still feeling and tender and very tasty. If I could only suggest one it would be the nachos for sure. The meatballs were amazing too. Also a one bite app, with the perfect amount of Tzatziki sauce and a very unique seasoning flavor, that I think was the fennel. If I had more time in Chicago I would definitely come back to this place for dinner. There are too many great combinations that I would be super excited to see the Chef's take on all of these dishes.",0.9985,0.734,0.23,0.036,0.5333888888888889

It was 7 types of rum and a splash of something pineapple-y, and it brought me back to my recent tropical vacation. It was delicious and packed a punch! Definitely got my $11 worth with that drink. I also had the strawberries & cream waffles which were delicious. Even my husband who is more of a savory over sweet person, loved it. The only downside was they didn't split the check. We didn't ask them to, but come on. There's 8 of us, and it's clearly not a business lunch, we're gonna need to pay separately.

It was surprisingly delicate for a breaded chicken sandwich, and I would highly recommend it as well. The ambience of the restaurant is really nice. It's laid back, but the service is excellent!

I always wanted an excuse to go there and for the first time in a long time, I had a date and chose this place. I went on a Wednesday night, so the restaurant was not terribly packed, but I had called ahead to make a reservation. While I waited on my guest to arrive, I was seated in the bar area. Ambiance: It was very eclectic... industrial, but modern. Very quiet and quaint. Price: It was a little pricier for the portions, but most of the entrees were around $20.  Service: The service was good. The waitstaff was attentive, not super bubbly, but very professional. Food: The drinks were pretty good. I ordered a moscow mule and my guest had a beer. I ordered a caesar salad and clam chowder, which were pretty decent. The salad sauce was not my favorite, but I know every restaurant has their own flavor. The clam chowder was very good, I just wish there had been more. My guest had the pasta dish and really enjoyed it. Parking: There is parking for $12, but there is also free parking along Lincoln if you can find any. Overall, I would give this place a solid 4. It is not the best food I have ever had, especially for the price, but it was definitely a good experience and a great place to bring intimate guests, family, and clients.",0.9919,0.756,0.2,0.044,0.5848148148148149

2016-02-09,3.0,"I wish I was writing a 5 star review of Gemini Bistro.  I really had high hopes. We dined on Friday, January 29th, as a part of restaurant week.  We made our reservations about 2 weeks in advance, a party of 4, at 7:30pm. I called the restaurant the day before to see if I could bring in a bottle of champagne, as the purpose of this meal was to ask my friends if they would stand up in my wedding.  The manager instead offered 4 complimentary glasses of champagne or prosecco, which was awesome!   My great experience at Gemini Bistro unfortunately doesn't go much further than that.  Three of the four of us arrived at 7pm, knowing we were early, figuring we would just have a drink at the bar, which we did.  Our last dining companion arrived at 7:30 on the dot.  We were not seated until 8pm, 30 minutes past our reservation time.  I understand restaurant week, and a busy Friday night, however, 3/4 of us were EARLY, and to be seated 30 minutes late with a reservation... just not a great start to the night. Our server was really hit or miss.  She was super attentive when we first sat down, and then disappeared for long stretches of time.  We also waited for what seemed like a dreadfully long time for each course.  To the point where one of my dinner mates had to leave before dessert was even served, because she only had a babysitter until 10pm.  We were seated at 8, and at 9:45 we didn't have dessert yet.  Tell me that's not excessive? The best part of the meal 100% was the soup (clam chowder.)  The walleye was ok, but smothered in over powering sauce.  By the time we did get to order dessert, they ran out of one of the restaurant week desserts, so brought out a few others complimentary, but they weren't anything we would've eaten, and went to waste.  Note to EVERY restaurant everywhere: if you're out of something, instead of just bringing something else, ask what would be preferred... it cuts down on waste. Icing on the cake:  Valet was advertised at $12 when we pulled up, but we were charged $16 upon leaving.",0.5511,0.856,0.079,0.065,0.46448148148148155

2015-12-21,4.0,"Had a reservation for 2 at 6P on a Saturday night. The restaurant was full, but didn't feel packed, like a can of sardines. The hostess was very welcoming and friendly. We had to wait a few minutes for our table, but we were able to get a glass of wine for the wait. Our ""table"" ended up being two seats at the bar. Admittedly, we were ~15 minutes late for our reservation, which may be why our seats were at the bar instead of at a table; regardless, I was somewhat disappointed by the seating arrangement. However, Paulie more than made up for this disappointment. Paulie was very attentive without being intrusive. He was extremely knowledgeable about the restaurant, menu, and food. When my boyfriend mentioned that he had seen really good reviews for the mushroom risotto, but didn't see it on the menu, Paulie asked Chef Ryan if he could make the dish for us. Not only did Chef Ryan agree to make it for us, he also told Paulie that he is always willing and able to make the dish for anyone who asks! This shows true dedication to serving the customers. We ordered the salmon tartare, mushroom risotto, and the boneless free-range chicken. The salmon tartare was well-balanced in its flavors and tasted really good on the rye bread. I would recommend this for a light appetizer (small mason jar of the tartare and 5 ""sticks"" of marble rye). I normally would never suggest ordering chicken at a restaurant; however, for this chicken dish, I would break my own rule (Paulie said the same thing!) The chicken thigh was perfectly crispy and moist at the same time, and the chicken sausage was flavorful. I even liked the carrots (which I normally pass on as well). I highly recommend this dish, especially to fried chicken lovers. And finally, my mushroom risotto... definitely worth asking for. It was creamy, had a good texture (not over or under cooked), and was surprisingly light! It had large pieces of mushrooms (which I love), but the risotto itself had a more subtle mushroom flavor; even my boyfriend, who doesn't like mushrooms, kept asking if he could have another bite. In addition to the food, we also order two glasses of wine and two double espresso. Based on the atmosphere and the quality of food, I fully anticipated spending ~$150 on the meal. However, I was once again pleasantly surprised by Gemini Bistro as the bill was only $85. This restaurant is a great place to go if you're looking for delicious, high-quality food prepared by an innovative and passionate chef. It's perfect for any night, but also has the atmosphere of a fancy night out.  (PS- there were at least 4 tables with children. This may be due to good parenting, but the presence of children did not diminish the atmosphere at all.

2015-10-09,1.0,"We went to Gemini last March for dinner. We had reservations but they stuck us behind the cabinet the busboys use to restock tables, which was not the end of the world, but still. Waitress was efficient but not friendly, food was fine, though overpriced. Atmosphere was nice apart from location of table. The reason I give this restaurant one star is that early on in our meal, a busboy dropped a glass right next to our table, like under our table. I didn't know this happened, but glass literally exploded up and hit us in the legs. A shard of glass actually hit my husband quite hard. He went to the bathroom to check and see if it cut through his pants. There was a dent in  his leg but it didn't, and no bleeding or anything. The part that was total b.s. was how the restaurant handled this situation. the waitress was very apologetic, the host, or possibly the manager came and asked us if there was anything he could do for us. They were very solicitous. But here's the thing. They were solicitous in a way that in no way tried to make this better for us. No one offered us anything, or quietly took anything off the bill afterwards (which we expected would be the case). Why go to the trouble of asking ""if there is anything we need"" if you aren't going to offer anything? This is an extremely rude way to phrase something because the restaurant screwed up, but they are putting the onus on US to ask for something to make the situation better instead of taking accountability for their own actions. It's like they were so worried that we were going to sue them or something that they forgot to be worried about ruining our dinner, or possibly, whether they were fixing the situation in a way that will make us come back and spread the word to our friends that we liked the place. We aren't the sort of people to let circumstances like that ruin a good time, but receiving that bill and seeing that no one thought to offer us a free desert or glass of wine or make any sort of GESTURE--because in the end it's about gestures and good manners, not monetary compensation--it really got us down. It's too bad because this place has a lot of promise but the staff clearly does not get it. We will never go back.",0.9451,0.775,0.129,0.095,0.5156445406445407

I had a reservation for two on a Friday night but due to unforeseeable circumstances, we were delayed in arriving on time. Adrian at the restaurant was extremely understanding and accommodating for us, which is rare on busy nights. I was very appreciative!  Upon arriving, we were very pleased with the decor and layout of this super cute restaurant. We were also very excited with the menu! We decided to start with the P.E.I Mussels Fra Deviolo. They were delicious!! The red marinara sauce coating the mussels and grilled bread was fabulous. There were crushed red pepper flakes in the sauce which added a perfect finish to the dish. Also, soaking the bread in it was icing on the cake.  I ordered the fillet special and garlic mashed potatoes. The fillet was served in a red wine bordelaise sauce with a dollop of seasoned butter. It was absolutely fantastic. The fillet was tender, thick, and delicious. The potatoes were perfection; creamy, dreamy, and they matched wonderfully with the bordelaise sauce mixed in. I could not be happier. My friend had the braised short rib, which was also delicious. It melted in your mouth upon eating. All this was paired with a wonderful bottle of the Mas Des Bressades. Our meal was delicious, service was impeccable, and overall it was a pleasant experience.

As per usual, I was wishing for a straw so I could slurp up all that fabulous mussel juice. Delish! For our entrees, one person got a salad which was huge and looked quite good. I got lamb pappardelle which was amazing!!! My hubby got the steak frites and was sadly disappointed. He said the steak didn't seem the be the right cut. So he was not thrilled with his meal. And I can't recall what the 4h person in our group ordered! We also shared brussles sprouts and green beans as sides. Both were fantastic! My husband doesn't even like brussles sprouts and he loved these! We were too full for dessert (which is probably a good thing).

Great cozy atmosphere and s nice selection of wine.  Food- overall yummy. They bring you delicious bread !! We had Caesar salad , mussels and the short rib ravioli to start . The salad and mussels were excellent. Short rib ravioli fell short. The sauce had hardened to form layer of funk up top. Not sure if it sat too long or what but even the taste was missing something . It came with 4 ravioli so keep that in mind for sharing. That's the only thing we had that I don't recommend. We also had the truffle fries and salmon . Both were excellent . One thing I was surprised about what the amount of children there on a Saturday night. Now I know it's Lincoln park and its a family neighborhood but I'm talking like 50% of tables seemed to have kids at them . Just a thought.

The restaurant is beautifully decorated and has a safari lodge type undertone with dark wood and animal themed décor. Our server was nice enough, but not overly attentive or courteous. She was helpful with choosing wine and appetizers though. We ended up getting the flatbread, parpadelle, sautéed mushrooms, and bread pudding, and our bill was over $100-for one appetizer, one entrée, one side, and one dessert (and two glasses of wine total). I am certainly not one to shy away from high priced meals if something is truly extraordinary, but the food at Gemini was not sticker shock worthy in the slightest. Don't get me wrong-everything was extremely delicious, but my friend and I were both surprised when the final bill came (shame on us for not looking at the prices closer when ordering!).

I got the Hangar Steak Frites, and while it was cooked perfectly to medium rare per my request, I felt that the bordelaise and the maitre'd butter didn't really add too much to the flavor profile. It was a very good steak, just not amazing. The frites were awesome -- definitely get the truffle upgrade. GF had the salmon, which came with an assortment of veggies (almost like a pico de gallo). Tasted fresh, but not huge into salmon, so take what I say with a grain of salt. Dessert, we got creme brulee and gelato. They were good, but not ""memorable"" -- whatever that means.

They tried to get us to move the reservation to an earlier time, I told them to keep it at the time I originally reserved but in order to make that work for them, we had to be out of there by a specific time. A little ridiculous but I obliged. We get there and they said we were late because they moved up my reservation to the earlier time! Didn't listen to me and were kind of pushy about it.

Anyone who's dined with me regularly in the past few months will notice that I'm a martini gal, specifically a lemon drop martini gal.  So, of course, having had a long, draining week, Friday night dinner was the perfect occasion to try Gemini's take on the LDM.  I'm surprised to say that I really didn't care too much for it (though if you were to ask me if I finished it all, the answer would be yes).  Heavy handed on the vodka meant little lemon flavor came through; balance is important people!

The over sized light shades hanging from the ceiling paired with the dark wood make for a warm relaxed place to enjoy dinner. The food was great and every dish we had was not only cooked perfectly they re-invent  classic dishes putting a new unique twist that makes you go mmmmmm. Service was 5 star, they where always there when we needed them but did not hang over us like a willow tree, they also knew the menu well and helped us with ordering.   Our Highlights  Truffle Fries - I know I know truffle fries but these where cooked perfect I suspect double fried so crisp like a whisper of french fry love floated into my mouth. Oyster Rockefeller- A hint of smoke to the dish with creamy spinach only comes with 4 could of eaten a dozen Beef Carpaccio - Great beef flavor the fried capers gave some nice texture go raw. Short Rib Ravioli - Just like mama never use to make. So good you like a dah ravioli you's gonna like a deez ravioli. really a great well rounded dish full of flavor mama mia. Kurobuta Pork Chop- it was silly how good this was perfectly cooked seasoned good size portion and the side dishes made me dance in my seat. Butternut squash bread pudding was sweet but savory creamy but not soggy and toasted for a crunch. The brussel sprout leaves where  like little peddles of fresh clean leafy goodness so green I thought is was spring. Cod (Special for the evening) - nice piece of fish moist inside with a nice sear on the outside just the way God intended fish to be cooked. A truffle parmesan polenta cake was cooked until crispy on the outside but still creamy in the center.  Great dish but a little light on the flavorful sauce needed more for mopping.

It's hard to go there for a moderate reasonable priced meal and some of the portions primarily in what they call  the medium plates could be bigger as they end up being no more then a taste in my opinion and at  14-18 bucks are almost the price of a entree at traditional bistro. A bistro i can go to on any Tuesday or Saturday and no big deal, Gemini Bistro to me is more of a special occasion place not a meal on a whim. Am i getting caught up in semantics, probably, do I do that often, no, so why now?

2013-03-02,4.0,"I find that in general, the density and general interests of the residents of Lincoln Park (of which I was one for many years) means that a restaurant can survive without really offering much that's interesting or of particularly high quality.

Gemini Bistro is not one of these restaurants.  For its standard Nouveau American menu in an area where you can charge a premium, their prices are pretty reasonable.  This is also one of those places where the gamble of ordering chicken will pay off (or at least what I perceive to be a gamble, my associate Brett would disagree), but the real gem here (couldn't help myself) is the 2 separate dish's that sport my personal favorite, short rib.  Both the Short Rib ravioli and the more standard Short Rib entree are both predictably delicious.",0.9618,0.844,0.127,0.03,0.5321264367816092

While you probably won't find any super crazy combinations a la organs or liquid nitrogen cooked food, Gemini Bistro is a solid spot for a tasty meal.  Four friends and I shared a myriad of plates in this warmly lit locale. The menu is complete with three different sections/sections - small, medium and large plates along with a handful of sides near the bottom. While I wasn't imbibing, the wine list looked pretty tops, too! Here are a few dishes I'd recommend... 1) Short rib ravioli: Incredibly flavorful and tender on the inside, perfectly al dente on the outside. Yum all around.  2) Truffle fries: Yeah yeah, you may say that truffle fries are 2010, but these are worth the order. The fries came out hot and crispilicious with a pretty delicious truffle dipping sauce. Good thing there were five of us at the table otherwise I would have taken down the entire cone.  3) Roasted chicken: The bird's the word. The chicken was juicy, plump and delightful. Also, the portion size was substantial - great if you feel like sharing.  4) Chocolate cake: A giant slab of cocoa heaven topped with homemade whipped cream with a size of peanut brittle topped salted caramel gelato. Yes. Get it.  The only dish that I would avoid next time is the crab cake. Perhaps I swung by on an off-crab night, but said dish tasted quite fishy and the remoulade didn't stand up to the dish.  With attentive service, a straightforward and tasty menu and a comfortable interior, I'm a fan of Gemini.",0.9962,0.744,0.234,0.021,0.6255511463844797

2012-08-21,5.0,"My meal at Gemini Bistro was the best meal I have had in recent memory. Plus, I felt that the price wasn't too bad at $120 for two people who each ordered 3 courses, plus I had 2 glasses of wine. We are definitely adding this place to my list of favorite restaurants. I started with a special salad because its ingredients were so wildly creative that I had to try it. It had pork belly, peaches, pecorino, walnuts, sweet onions and a light dressing. It was a playful combination of flavors and textures. Definitely not something I would have thought of, and that is the entire point of going to a restaurant, right? My husband had the pork tenderloin for his entree, which he ate so quickly that I didn't have time to try it. Clearly he loved it. I had the short rib ravioli. It was incredible. When I go back to Gemini Bistro there is a strong chance I will order it again. Sometimes I have this problem where I fall in love with a dish the first time I visit a restaurant and I always want to order it when I go back to the restaurant. I do get exactly what I want and expect, but I fail to try the rest of the menu. The short rib ravioli was a medium plate, and I loved the somewhat sweet sauce with the melt in your mouth ravioli with the contrast of salty parmesan. Of course I ate every bite. Ordering a medium plate instead of a large plate for my entree meant I had room for dessert- perfect planning! It is very rare that my husband and I order dessert, and this might have been one of only a couple times when we both ordered dessert. The first two courses were so phenomenal that I had to try dessert. The dessert menu was also very tempting. I had the Peach Cobbler. It was the perfect thing to order on what was a very fall-like evening. The cobbler was baked in a ramekin. Why is this important? More delicious crust! The peaches were fresh, and the topping was crisp and sugary. The vanilla gelato on top was from Black Dog Gelato and was just as good at the gelato I had in Italy. My husband had the cheesecake. The chef started off as a cheesecake maker, and the cheesecake was creamy and rich. I just liked the peach cobbler more.",0.9962,0.803,0.179,0.019,0.5788561076604557

We were first seated inside (our choice)...but after seeing how the scene looked more lively outside...our server politely moved us to an outside table.     The outside dining area is kind of cramped...so dont be surprised to deal with people jogging / carrying groceries / walking dogs etc. within the public sidewalk between tables every few seconds.   Other than that, the street that it's located is pleasant and quiet.   As an appetizer, we ordered a single crab cake for $16.  It was made in house and the crab meat was very fresh.  It also came with a small garnish salad...it was okay, but a little underwhelming for the price.   A good 25 minutes elapsed between appetizer and delivery of main dish w/o seeing our server.  I ordered the roasted salmon.  I was told it would have a pink center so I asked for it to be medium well.  WELL it was a little too done because the edges were burnt.   It was also way too salty for my taste - I'm a fan of salty  food, but this was overdoing it.  The salad it came with was super soggy and also very salty since the salmon was sitting right on top of it. My husband ordered the ""gemini burger"" for $14 w/ parmesan crusted fries.  Be careful when the server asks do you want ""plain"" or ""parmesan"" fries.....the parmesan crusted adds a $3 surcharge which the menu or server will not inform you of!  The gemini burger comes with a potato bun that he personally did not like.  It was very dry and starchy.  The pickle spear was very thin and sad looking.  The onion and lettuce was okay.  The burger did not have any type of mayo or sauce included....which exaggerated the buns dryness.  However, the server brought him a cup of dijon mustard upon special request.   Overall, I would look at other options for a bistro experience.  The prices were a little high for mediocre service / food quality.",0.9777,0.869,0.104,0.027,0.5120294784580499

We were seated immediately by a friendly hostess and greeted immediately by a friendly and helpful waitress.  The menu is designed for sharing and organized by small plates (about the size of an appetizer for one), medium plates (sized as an appetizer for 2), and large plates (regular entree size).  In addition, they also have vegetable sides available for sharing. They offer a pretty good variety in wine, and have many reasonable bottles along with some more expensive reserves.  The cocktail menu was not overly impressive, so we just went with a bottle of their malbec. We were given some homemade bread with a sundried tomato tapenade, that gave us something to munch on while we mulled over the menu.  We decided to order two of the medium dishes and one of the small dishes to share.  The food came out extremely quick (almost too quick since we hadn't even finished our first glass of wine).  The tomato soup with a grilled cheese wedge ($8) was delicious.  We are suckers for tomato soup and grilled cheese, so we decided to order this small plate to share since we were in the mood.  It was a deliciously thick tomato soup that was made without cream. The next item was the medium sized risotto ($14) that was flavored perfectly with wood mushrooms, rosemary (not in an overpowering way) and parmesan cheese.  Since risotto is so heavy, the amount of food was perfect for us to share. Our third item was the medium sized yellowfin tuna ($18).  The tuna was crusted with sesame and just barely seared (as it should be).  There was a tasty pile of greens flavored with a vinaigrette and red and yellow grape tomatoes.  My boyfriend was a little skeptical on whether we had ordered enough food, but by the end of the meal, we were perfectly full without being uncomfortable.  All the items were easy to share and very tasty in a simple way.  Service was pleasant and quick.  Gemini Bistro may not have the most original items on the menu, but what they do, they do extremely well.  Rather than try to go with weirder flavor combinations like many of the Chicago restaurants do, they stick with what works, and their food is high in quality and taste.  I look forward to coming back and trying some of the other options.",0.9984,0.752,0.207,0.04,0.5382206494070901

For the main course three of us ordered the short ribs and the other ordered the hanger steak.  Everyone was complimentary regarding the taste and quality of the entrées.  For dessert we had three helpings of the apple crisp that included a scoop of maple-pecan gelato made by Black Dog Gelato on Damen Ave. (which I believe makes the best gelato in the city) and one order of the cheese cake.  The desserts were very rich and flavorful.  Overall, we had very enjoyable dining experience.  The quality of the food was very good although it was definitely on the rich side, our bar service outstanding, and our table service competent and efficient.  The Gemini Bistro is located in vibrant Lincoln Park that is always fun to visit, and we look forward to going back to try the regular menu.",0.9987,0.8,0.193,0.008,0.4421730769230769

The ravioli itself was light and clearly hand-made filled with the most tender short rib I've ever tasted; the sauce is to die for. The mussels were also great. I would have eaten the lightly spicy tomato sauce like a soup had it been socially acceptable! The crab cake was a little dry. Not bad, but definitely not as strong as the other dishes.

After looking at the menu, we realized that many of the pairings were actually CHEAPER if you ordered them all separately than if you got them prix-fixe. Very shady .  We'd wanted to go here for awhile simply because of their regular menu, so we got a few dishes. The girlfriend got the caesar salad and the short rib ravioli and I got the scallops and the mussels. Her caesar salad was the worst I've ever tasted (how the eff do you mess up the dressing on a caesar salard? It was so acidic you could barely eat it). And the short rib in the short rib ravioli had almost no taste. My scallops were swimming in some kind of super acidic sauce that I had to sweep away from my scallops. Not good at all. The mussels were supposed to be in a spicy red sauce, but the sauce had little to no flavor at all.

My entree was a nicely cooked half chicken with as-advertised crispy skin.  It was pretty tasty if a bit under seasoned, and was served on top of some fantastic whipped potatoes that were delightfully rich and creamy, and an absolutely awesomely savory mushroom ragout. I also got to try the scallops and the baby beet salad.  The scallops were a pretty bold dish, served in a rich brown butter sauce with an aggressively sharp citrus and caper component.  I really liked the dish but it was a little much for my wife.  The beet salad was excellent, tender roasted beets tossed in a truffle vinaigrette and presented next to a spread of fluffy goat cheese allowing you to engineer each bite to your liking.

2011-12-17,2.0,"After a group of friends and I went to see the Lincoln Park Zoo Lights, we walked over to Gemini Bistro for dinner since it was so close. After looking over the menu, I thought it would be a decent dinner, and I couldn't argue with the proximity. One thing I'll say right away is that the service was impeccable. They really have everything setup nicely and the servers are professional, nice, and very organized. However, in general I found the food to be lacking. FOOD: Swordfish Provencal: My fish was definitely overcooked, and it seemed to be underseasoned. The roma tomatoes were a nice complement to the fish, but overall I couldn't help but to feel that this dish was a bit lacking, and some roasted potatoes or other type of starch accompaniment would have been nice to have. Trout special w/risotto: I'm pretty sure this was a trout, but all I remember was salt. I'm fairly confident that the fish had a crust of something besides salt, but I have no idea what it was. The risotto was cooked well, although I couldn't make out much of it besides...salt. Mushroom Risotto: This was my favorite dish that I tried this night, and I was fairly impressed. They do use a truffle oil, but it was at least used conservatively and lightly drizzled on top. It had the right amount of liquidity and each risotto was cooked al dente from what I could gather. If I ever had to come back here, I would get this. SERVICE: As I mentioned above, service was great. We arrived in a party of 18, and we ended up with two servers who split responsibility. I was thoroughly impressed with the organization of the restaurant as well as the knowledge of our server. Kudos to the staff. VALUE/OVERALL: I'm just going to go out and say it - I probably won't come back here unless for some reason I'm forced to go back. It's not that Gemini Bistro is terrible; I just found it lacking and for the prices on the menu (i.e. $28 for my overcooked/underseasoned/small swordfish), there are far better options in the area just up or down the street. I debated giving the place an extra star for the service itself, but at the end of the day, good food draws you back to a place whereas excellent service alone will not.",0.9961,0.783,0.18,0.037,0.5523908730158731

Our server was a young woman who was personable and did knowledgeable.  However, the pace of the dinner was poor.  After my soup arrived seconds after we put in our order.  I had to flag down another employee to request a spoon.  Just as I was finishing my soup they dropped off the bread.   We had to flag down the server for another round of drinks.   We then proceeded to wait a very long, long time for our entrees. At this point there were very few customers in the restaurant.  My wife's enjoyed her fish and my steak was pretty good.  However my fries tasted like diner fries.   One thing I couldn't figure out was the music.  Maybe it was their schtick, I don't know.  But listening to AC/DC at a place like that didn't seem to fit.   To sum it up, the experience was as though the staff wanted the night to be over.  At over $130 for 4 drinks, 1 soup and 2 entrees, you can do much better.",-0.8811,0.827,0.077,0.096,0.47638888888888886

2011-09-27,4.0,"Great restaurant! We came here on Saturday night and had a great meal. It was busy, but not overly crowded, which was nice. The atmosphere was fun and lively. We started off with the Mussels and they were great. They were in a red sauce that looked like tomato soup, but provided a nice little punch of heat at the end. The mussels themselves were HUGE! I kept commenting on how big and succulent they were. For my main I had the swordfish with a tomato/caper topper and it was delish. The fish was cooked perfectly, and the topping of tomatoes and capers was very plentiful! It was a little acidic and something on the side to cut that would have been nice, but overall I really enjoyed my meal! My two friends each ordered the special scallops with risotto and I had a taste of the risotta and it was great. They also split the crab cake and they devoured it. My friends dad had the short ribs with potatoes and he thoroughly enjoyed his meal. He said the meat was cooked perfectly and he was very pleased!  We ordered two bottles of the Bordeaux wine and it was FANTASTIC! It was served at the perfect temperature. We left absolutely no room for dessert, but we definitely lingered talking well over an hour after our meal had ended and there was no rush to kick us out.  I would definitely return to Gemini Bistro again. The food was excellent, the service was great and the atmosphere was very fun and lively!

They even had a kid's menu (which worried me, because I like to eat sans poopy diapers and loud screams. However, I found that neither of these disturbed my experience because they were non-existent! A break down of the menu: They had good enough beer, expensive wine, a kid's menu, and a wide variety of entree options for me and the boo to choose from. Sold. I started with the gaspacho--uh yesss, how can you resist this menu option in the summer?! They also had summer corn soup and a baby beet salad that caught my eye. Their ""medium"" section included: raviolis, crabcakes, risottos, and mussels. Oh yea, we got the MMMussels. The crunchy bread that came with them and the regular ole bread on the table were both delightful. I had to push it away (but not before I gave the bread a few dunks in the mussel marinade). Their ""large"" plates consisted of: steak frites, duck, chicken breast, salmon, and lamp chops. We decided to split the chicken breast and got a side of the brussel sprouts that were a good size, I would highly recommend them. The desserts ranged from $9-$14 but we did not indulge.

2011-08-28,4.0,"I am back home from a very pleasant dinner at Gemini Bistro with a group of friends. Overall it was a very positive experience. The decor is nice and there is al fresco dining available as well, though our group was a tad too large to be accomodated outdoors. Gemini Bistro features American food with some French inspiration and offers fairly diverse options as well as daily specials and a Prix Fixe option that is very reasonably priced (available if your dinner begins by 6:30pm). With the Prix Fixe, you choose from a few options each for three courses for $32 and for an extra $23 you can also receive wine pairings (choosing from two to three different wines per course). While the menu is not overly creative, the food is quite good and a lot of the plates have some fun accompaniments (i.e. the tomato soup comes with a mini grilled cheese on the side).  Gemini Bistro also features a full bar with some tasty sounding cocktails, a few beer options and a moderate sized wine list. The wines have very reasonable mark ups and (at least tonight) the pour was very generous. Our server was good, not great. Her assistant always kept our water glasses filled. The meal had a leisurely pace, but not too slow.  Food wise my wife and I shared two appetizers (the aforementioned tomato soup and also the sweet pea risotto). Both were great, with the sweet pea rissotto being the better of the two. For mains we both opted for the hanger steak which was pretty good and had a pleasant marinade. We both are firm believers in steak being meant to be eaten rare and they did not disappoint in preparing the steak to our satisfaction. The steak came with fries which were the only bad item I tried at Gemini Bistro; way too salty and lacking in flavor. For dessert I went with the peach crisp (which was only fair and did not taste nearly as good as it looked or as the description made it sound) but my wife's creme brulee was very good. Sadly she was rather stingy and used her steak knife to fight me off as I went in for a third bite.  The others in our party all seemed pleased with the meal as well.  Gemini Bistro offers a good value especially if you dine early and opt for the Prix Fixe, and they are also a part of Open Table and Savored (with Savored you pay $10 and receive 30% off your meal - food and beverages alike). While Gemini Bistro does not quite aspire to the levels of my favorite Chicago restaurants, it was a good experience and I would not hesitate to return here for another meal.",0.9972,0.759,0.192,0.048,0.5555535989434295

Outdoor seating is along the Dickens side of the street, so its quieter and more comfortable. If it's still warm out, I highly recommend this.  The food is good, not great.

2011-08-19,5.0,"This review is embarrassingly late, as I try to eat at Gemini once a week.  Before it opened, I was always baffled as to why there wasn't a solid neighborhood joint that would be perfect for- drinks with the girls, take your parents to dinner when they're in town, date night, etc. A place that was tasteful and elegant, but comfortable and reasonably priced. And then, Gemini opened its doors.  My history with this place started when I was on  match.com  and needed a place that I could walk to, or run away from, if the date was terrible. Its classy decor and menu with something for everyone also helped. The first couple times I went, I was usually early and set up shop at the bar for a pre-date drink. I started chatting up with the adorable bartender, Emilio, (who I will praise in a bit) who always put me at ease and had a glass of Pomelo in front of me before I could hang my purse on one of those bonus points hooks under the bar. My pre-date conversation with Emilio was always better than the actual date, and so my  match.com -ing came to an end, but my love affair with Gemini began.  Now for the food, we'll start with the small plates.  Beet Salad- is tasty but too small. Creamless tomato soup- dynamite, with the most delectable little grilled cheese to compliment. Summer salad- my favorite salad on the menu (although it could use a little extra blue cheese) Caesar- does anyone order these anymore? it's what you would expect from a caesar salad. Medium plates: Only one of these I've had is the sweet pea risotto. This my friends, is magical. So creamy, so cheesy, so beautiful. For a girl, this is a full meal. Big plates: I've only had two of these. But one of them is now the only thing that I ever order (unless I'm feeling me some sweet pea risotto.)  The chicken is succulent and so good. It's one of the few times that ordering chicken (BORING) is acceptable.  But now, the real winner... the burger. I would say, this is one of my top 3 burgers in the city. The meat is top notch, with a little cheddar, mmmmm. I tend to skip the pretzel bun as I enjoy inhaling the french fries, but for a lot of my friends, the pretzel bun is a bonus. If you're feeling really special, you should upgrade the fries for the parm truffle fries, they are beyond words.  I'm not a desert person, so you'll have to refer to other reviews for that. If I were you, I would make sure that my Gemini encounter begins with a drink at the bar with Emilio. He is wonderful. I rarely sit at a table anymore, as you can get full service at the bar.  I would recommend this place for any occasion. My parents are coming into town in a couple weeks, and I plan on making a reservation for Gemini all three nights that they are here.",0.9989,0.777,0.21,0.013,0.6218091998704245

2011-06-05,2.0,"I'm not certain why Gemini Bistro has received such accolades - I found the restaurant to be a huge disappointment. I started with the creamless tomato soup which tasted exactly like Campbell's tomato soup but cost about $7 more. My friend and I then split the spring pea risotto which arrived looking like a large bowl of pea soup and funny enough, tasted that way too! Every now and then I got a few bits of rice on my spoon, but certainly not enough that I would classify the dish as risotto. The swordfish provencal was nothing I couldn't make at home. In fact, I make a dish almost identical to this one - it costs about $20 to feed two people, so I'm not sure where Gemini Bistro gets off charging $26 a plate. The side of mushroom ragout was completely unmemorable. My friend and I were hesitant to order dessert, but truth be told we were still hungry after three courses. We went ahead and ordered the strawberry rhubarb crisp. As we were waiting, I regaled my dining partner with the story of the ""high fructose corn syrup"" strawberry rhubarb compote I received at Red Rooster, just around the corner, and said that any dessert had to be better than that! I was wrong. The pastry chefs at Red Rooster and Gemini Bistro must be friends, because one bite of the strawberry rhubarb crisp and my friend said, ""Tastes like high fructose corn syrup."" If that dish doesn't make you sleep like a baby I don't know what will. The decor at Gemini Bistro was nothing spectacular or interesting, and the service was poor.

We started off with the scallops small plate. Three plump scallops in an insanely delicious sauce with pea shoots - perfectly seared and seasoned. We loved those. We then followed it up with two soups - cream of mushroom for him, and tomato soup for me. He loved his, but I personally felt I ""won"" the soup course with my rich but bright tomato soup and mini grilled cheese on the side (such a cute but delicious touch). For our entrees, I ordered their rare tuna special, and he had the duck breast. Both were outstanding. We had martinis, wine and a cocktail with dinner, and we each got dessert (him a cheesecake-style dessert, and for me a classic creme brulee - both were outstanding.) Was it pricey? You bet your hat. But the food and drinks were exceptional, and for a special occasion or a very romantic evening, it was worth every single penny. Our server Wyatt (I think that was his name?) was outstanding as well. He ensured our orders were taken in the order we wanted to receive our food, and kept tabs on our evening without being overbearing. Our food came out promptly, but not too quickly, allowing us time to savor each course and enjoy a few moments in between dishes.

They seem quite capable of putting out decent food. Mushroom soup was lovely. I'd pass on the hot-sauced mussels, which are seasoned to the point that you could be eating anything. The SERVICE & AMBIENCE were quite agreeable. It was empty when I came in around 6 on a Friday, and steadily filled up. Nice bar to sit at if alone. The DRINK was so-so. I wish Chicago bartenders would learn that putting booze on ice & then thrashing it maniacally for several minutes - though it may be good for the biceps - only waters the drink down and fills it with air, neither of which are desirable outcomes. Also, when you have anything sugary in the mix, if you shake it all crazy like that, it makes an unpleasant foam on top, like dishwater. Don't they have bartender schools anymore?

Firstly, valet parking is a mere $8--deal.  The restaurant itself is warm and cozy.  We arrived a few minutes early so grabbed drinks at the smallish bar.  I had the Gemini Lemonade which was very refreshing and delicious.   We were seated at a cozy little table in the jam-packed restaurant promptly at 8 p.m.  Our server was Wyatt and yes I remember his name because a) I try to make it a point to remember people's names, and b) he was an excellent server.  Prompt, friendly, accommodating, etc. etc. etc.  As my husband put it, everything was almost too perfect.   Everything we ordered was really yummy.  I started with the beet salad and had the short rib with garlicky spinach for my main.  The short rib was so tender I didn't even need a knife.  My hubby and I shared the truffle parmessan fries.  Yum yum yum.  Sadly we were both too full for dessert.  I say sadly, because they have some skillet cookie goodness that sounded divine.  Next time...",0.9888,0.803,0.175,0.023,0.5514492753623189

People were dressed in anything from bow ties to jeans. The lighting is dim and the music is set at just the right volume (and great- heard Hall and Oates, Phil Collins, my main men). The bar is separated from the dining tables, which I liked because that way it doesn't get too loud or crowded around where you are eating. The light fixtures were real cool. The menu breaks down into small plates, medium plates, and large plates; so you can dine here any amount of hungry. Soup du jour was lobster bisque and quite frankly, I couldn't pass that up. They nicely brought it out in two bowls for us! The bisque had a great flavor and a few chunks of lobster as well. I hate when the bisque doesn't actually have the lobster... For my meal I opted for the mussels (which were a medium plate) and a side of truffle-parm fries. Date went with the steak(filet) frites. My mussels were fantastic. They were in a crushed red pepper marinara sauce served with a toasted piece of french bread. The dish was a large medium and would have been plenty even without the fries. A filet and plate of fries for $27 is almost unbeatable. Of course, carrot cake was on the dessert menu so we had to split that too.

First let me say that the water-refills were SUPERB.  I don't think my glass went with less than 3 sips out of it the entire night.   Our waiter was mellow, helpful and very attentive.  He gave recommendations that were spot on and asked if we needed anything while we were eating bread, soup, our entrees and dessert.  He also slyly dropped off the bill without any cutesy fanfare (i.e. none of that ""Just gonna leave this here for ya but no rush!"") Now for the stars of the show...

I had the ""medium"" size short rib ravioli - rich and flavorful.  I liked the little spice dab at the bottom of the plate.  It was so cute!  What WERE those spices??  Nicely presented and definitely the right portion size considering the richness.  Husband got the ""large"" salmon which was very moist, flavorful and generously sized.  We also shared the parmesean fries....lots of fries, a little more sauce would have been good.  Daaaang they were good though. We finished off with the skillet cookie.  Have you ever been disappointed with a skillet cookie?  This is no exception.  Candied walnuts are a nice touch.

Gemini Bistro standing valiantly at the intersection. As you step inside, you immediately feel the warm and inviting atmosphere and it beckons you to come in.

A coat rack conveniently located behind the host stand if you choose to get rid of your bulky winter coat. My best girls and I settled into our booth. A wonderful glass of Pinot Noir warmed me up while we waited for our first course selections to arrive. Though it was Restaurant Week, we decided to sample a few things off the regular dinner menu.  The beet salad was the only thing that was a bit off to me, didn't taste as great as I would've imagined. The potato leek soup was buttery and delicious. Short rib ravioli with tomato marmalade was fabulous, the sweetness of the marmalade added a nice unique flavor. We got the last swordfish of the night and lucky us, it was heavenly!! Served with Roma tomatoes, olives, and capers, it was flavorful and well prepared, probably the best dish of the night. The mushroom risotto was creamy and delicious. Grilled lamb chops--juicy and flavorful--my second favorite dish of the night. Carrot cake for dessert, lighter tasting than your usual carrot cake but still good. I wish it hadn't been served so cold, it should have been warmed up to room temperature.  Our server Jen was knowledgeable about the menu and provided great recommendations.

The menu is simple with three distinct sections. Small plates would be for the individual appetizers that include a variety of salads and soups. The Medium plates are to be shared with your guests. They are more diverse and include scallops, risotto, ravioli, crab cakes and more. All were delicious. And of course, the Large plates are the entree. Steak Fritte, salmon, roasted chicken, chops. You name it.  I can't forget to mention the extensive wine and cocktail listings. Be sure to arrive early or stay late to enjoy one of the many libations.  No one at the table was disappointed in any way and no one walked away hungry. However, I hear you can't pass up the carroty cake if you are a true aficionado.

The building itself is very unique and the corner location provides great views to the outside where they have hung blue holiday lights along the windows. The place was very lively on a Friday night but the seating arrangement in the restaurant allows you to have a very intimate dinner here without feeling like you are too close to the next table. Great decor with exposed bulbs, dark furniture and roomy booths. Would be a perfect choice for a date and for friends and family.  Service was outstanding! From the valet to the host to the bus boys to the server - everyone made sure we were taken care of. Our server gave us great suggestions and had our table prepped with extra plates/appropriate utensils before each plate came out. Water was always full...it's the little things that make me happy!  The food was excellent. Although we were there during restaurant week, we opted to order off the regular menu because there were so many items we wanted to try! We ordered the following:  SMALL  baby beet salad --- love the idea of this dish but i felt this fell short for me. the truffle vinaigrette was a bit overpowering for the beets.  soup du jour --- it was potato leek and was very creamy...you could taste the butter but I would have liked to taste more of the leeks.  MEDIUM  short rib ravioli --- tasty short rib in ravioli...how could you go wrong with this dish? Tomato marmalade was unique and a fresh spin on the otherwise average tomato sauce.  mushroom risotto --- also a good dish, a little too much truffle oil for my taste.  LARGE  swordfish provencal --- we managed to get the last one of the night and we were glad we did! A great portion size and the swordfish was tender and hearty. The roma tomatoes, olives and capers were a great complement to the fish. Best dish of the night.  grilled lamb chops --- a great dish. The meat was flavorful by itself but the spinach and feta pie really made it special. It was a surprisingly perfect addition to the chops. Also a great portion of food...I suppose that is why they call these dishes large : ) Great for sharing!  DESSERT  spiced carrot cake - hmmm, they had me until the dessert. The carrot cake had potential but it was cold - like they just took it out of the fridge cold so it wasn't as enjoyable as it should have been. The raisins that garnish the plate were stuck together and the frosting would have tasted much better at room temperature. It was a lighter version than the usual rich carrot cake.

2011-02-06,5.0,"Gemini Bistro was another excellent choice for one of our periodic theater/dinner date nights.  All aspects of the experience were top-notch and effortless to enjoy.  Truly, this was a minor point or two short of perfect, but I'm rounding up for intangibles.   It all began with the service:  through OpenTable, I asked for a quiet table in the back; we arrived slightly early and got the quietest, furthest-back table in the restaurant.  That was a very promising start.  Also, throughout the evening, our server Jennifer struck the perfect note of warmth and readiness to assist, while the bus staff kept our waters filled and table cleared with alacrity. The fare, as it should be, was the strongest suit.  The cocktail list seems tailored to summer, but that didn't stop me from ordering the Cucumber Northside--Hendricks gin, cucumber, lemon, mint, and soda.  It's a great pre-dinner cocktail because the flavors complement each other, but there is no dominating taste that lingers to compete with the gustatory pleasures to come.   I started with the baby beet salad, with lamb's lettuce, goat cheese, and white truffle vinaigrette.  It was a very handsome presentation, with the green, white, and maroon ingredients segregated into individual piles and formed into a sort of tri-color triangle.  The beet portion was generous, which made me very happy, as those little devils were almost indescribably delicious.  This is my favorite beet salad of recent memory. In between courses I nibbled on selections of bread presented in a metal cone.  The buttery white kind was fine, but the wheaty, seeded variety was very, very good. My girlfriend and I shared the mushroom risotto with our entrees; while enjoyable, this was the only subpar item of the meal, especially as compared to the rest of the outstanding dishes.  I chose the swordfish provençal, featuring roma tomatoes, kalamata olives, capers, and sweet basil.  I was thrilled that the tomato and basil flavors dominated, with the capers and olives providing supporting notes.  Excellent, excellent entree--one of my favorite fish dishes in recent memory.  The server recommended it out of the three choices with which I was wrestling, and she was dead right. Of course we had to sample a couple of desserts, namely the carrot cake (with raisin-walnut chutney and brandy anglaise) and the skillet sundae.  Both were delicious, if perhaps less creatively conceived than the rest of the menu.  But we couldn't have asked for better at that point; we were swimming half-deliriously in the lambent magic of the evening and soaking up every drop. Perhaps we brought it with us and this was all in my mind, but I believe that the space itself contributed handsomely to the romantic tenor of the evening.  Dim lighting and urbane decor predominate, but the personality of the restaurant runs through it all like a subtle electric current.  The isolated position of our table left us undistracted by other diners.  With candied gazes, boisterous laughter, and sparkling conversation, my inestimable companion and I created a bubble of enamored gaiety around our table.  Was there an invisible Cupid flitting above our heads, sprinkling bewitchment over our evening?  Or perhaps we didn't need his help, just an assist from an all-around wonderful meal by Gemini Bistro.",0.9991,0.723,0.235,0.042,0.5989413265306122
2011-02-06,4.0,"I found Gemini Bistro last minute; we were originally going to go to Vie, but my car was still buried, and the second choice (Bistro Campagne) had no reservations available. So, despite the fact that I ended up here through a random OpenTable search, it was a happy accident! When we arrived, I was initially struck by how busy it was, every table was packed and it was fairly loud. While waiting for our table to open up, we got a drink at the bar; the beer selection is limited (9 beers I believed), but did include a personal favorite in Dogfish Head 60 (which turned out to be 90 despite what the menu said, even better!). Once seated, we started with a ""Medium"" of short rib ravioli; it turned out to be delicious if a bit overpriced. My main course of Steak Frites (with parmesan-truffle fries) was delicious; juicy, cooked exactly as I ordered it, and with a somewhat understated but excellent reduction. My girlfriend had the Braised short rib (her favorite dish to try at new places) which was also very good (puree was the favorite part, we both wished there was more). Overall, a good experience; I would definitely eat here again.",0.9897,0.759,0.191,0.051,0.5268069861173309

2011-01-04,2.0,"Gemini Bistro is a close, local option for me - however, I will not be returning.  I have gone multiple times and chose to wait to see what consistencies regarding the food and service came to the surface.  I've been a total of 5 times, lunch, brunch and dinner 3 times. I went most recently with my sister and sat at the bar because I was told by the hostess that there were no tables available in an empty restaurant.   The hostess seemed new as she was prompted by a silent trainer who pointed, motioned and just made the situation awkward alongside the gentleman who seemed to be the manager/partner.   The bartenders were very friendly and offered great recommendations, which is the only redeeming factor of our visit.  Food: I started with the mushroom soup, bland and weird dry mushrooms on top that might have been there for texture, but they were off.   But the worst part....my sister started with the beet and goat cheese salad - which was disgusting.  It had been pre-plated catering style as the balsamic vinegar was hardened on the plate as was the goat cheese and the beets had a strange texture as a result.  The plate was freezing cold.  This is unacceptable.  In a ""fine dining"" restaurant, the partners and chefs should be ashamed to serve this type of food especially for the price.   We split the short ribs, which were tough and lacking seasoning.   Drinks and wine were good. Service: Hostess - New, I'll give her a pass, but their training needs improvement and her trainer, rude. Partner/Manager - He was walking around the entire night looking frantic and frankly, if he didn't know you - forget it, you received little to no attention.  Considering the location and type of business you can receive from me and other local residents - that's the kiss of death to ignore anyone, let alone everyone who wasn't important to you.  Disappointing and not welcoming. Bartenders - Great, the best part of the entire experience.  Very personable and offered great recommendations and were funny.  These two were the only redeeming factors of the entire experience.  I didn't want to have to write this type of review especially since its a local business, but the disappointing experiences and lackuster food and service left no choice.  The salad was unforgivable and I cannot return.",-0.9889,0.757,0.076,0.167,0.5828282828282828

Overall we had a very nice time and the service was attentive and friendly. For the apps we had the salad and beef carpaccio, both very good. For the entrees we chose the Dover sole stuffed with crab and the rack of lamb. They were both cooked very well and well portioned.

We chose the Caesar salad, baby beet salad, seared sea scallops, and braised short rib.   The food did deliver on flavor.  The beets especially were a standout - perfectly roasted and seasoned with balsamic reduction and creamy goat cheese.   Unfortunately the value just wasn't there given the portion size.   The most egregious example was the scallops.   This dish appeared in the ""Medium plates"" section of the menu, so we expected something larger than an appetizer.   When a large bowl arrived containing two! scallops accompanied by nothing else, it felt like the kitchen must be having a joke at our expense.   I guess they have to give you at least two or they'd have to list it on the menu simply as ""scallop"".   Were they good?  Yes.   Was each worth $7?  No way.   Two scallops should have been an $8-$10 appetizer in the ""Small plates"" section of the menu. Our server apologized that she hadn't explained the portion sizes when we ordered, but no one else at the restaurant came to the table to even acknowledge that we may have been disappointed.   I'd recommend that Gemini bistro brings their portions in line with their prices.   Failing that, they should make their menu clearer to set diners' expectations accordingly.",0.9752,0.79,0.149,0.061,0.563718820861678

2010-10-04,5.0,"I'll proudly admit to anyone and everyone that I'm a Gemini.  I represent those disrobed twins to the max with each of the dominant characteristics of curiosity, chattiness, pensiveness and versatility.  On another note, it's often 'my way or the highway' and I can play the role of selectively choosing which attribute to have armed and ready when need be.  With this said, decisions make me fluster.  So when I saw Gemini Bistro's Prix Fixe menu, I was all set to go.  The folks at Gemini know quite well that $31 / $49 (including wine pairing) is such a steal that it's only available from 5 pm until 6:30 pm.  Even more fitting, I'm a chatty old lady at heart who likes to eat an early dinner to avoid acid reflux once hitting the hay.  6 pm is a perfect dinner hour for me so I actually won't complain for once.  It's 3 courses are perfectly spaced taking up roughly a delectable 2 hour dining experience. Course I: I began with the Creamless Tomato Soup which was far from the acidity of Campbell's Soup and yet kept that basic tomato flavor without anything too overboard.  The accompanying herkimer cheddar cheese crostini was ideal for dipping, and the Italian Prosecco fit it quite well.  My friend had the Mushroom Risotto which was fab!  I despise the texture of risotto, however, this recipe was mere perfection without an overwhelming amount of mushrooms. Course II: How could I go with any entree other than the Steak Frite?  The grilled hangar steak was just the right amount, very lean, cooked perfectly to avoid any knifing issues that can often cause embarrassment.  I obviously had no choice but to upgrade to the truffle crispy frites, and I'm so thankful I did.  The maitre'd butter sauce wasn't overwhelming in quantity drowning the steak frite, nor was it too sparse for some dipping action.  Both the Cabernet and Pinot Noir were nice wines to pair it with. Course III: Strawberry Shortcake was calling my name since the strawberry season was nearing an end.  I never thought I could imagine a fancy strawberry shortcake concoction, but Gemini made it happen.  It was a nice size that was comfortably edible at the end of a several-course meal.  The strawberry gelato was easily soaked up by the maple shortcake.  Delish!

2010-06-03,3.0,"Since I had a lot on my mind before leaving for my month-long adventure in Nepal, I never got around to posting my farewell dinner at Gemini Bistro on the 28th of April. Erica and I wanted to try this neighborhood spot for a long time and their 3-course menu with wine looked appealing. We had a nice dining experience with good food, fast service and a fun atmosphere. I can see how this is a popular spot to have a meal with friends or a place for date night. The décor is inviting and tasteful, yet sophisticated. The space is small enough to feel cozy, but there is plenty of room between tables. The service was first class and knowledgeable. Our first two courses arrived so fast that I thought they were trying to get rid of us, but the pace slowed down and we never felt rushed. We were disappointed that the food did not live up to the rest of the dining experience. Some dishes were nice, but more of them were bland and not overly flavorful. There is plenty of potential and reasons to return and recommend Gemini. I've heard brunch is very good, and if I lived down the street I'd probably go back much sooner. The talent is there; maybe they just need a little tune up. For our meal we started with the pea risotto and tomatoes soup with grilled cheese. I enjoyed my risotto quite a bit, but Erica's tomato soup was a big letdown. There was not a lot of flavor or substance. They say it is not cream based, which my doctor would appreciate, but they need to do something else to create flavor. Even the grilled cheese didn't taste better than what we can make at home. My risotto was creamy, cheesy and well made. First course was hit and miss. The main course followed the same pattern. I ordered the handmade ravioli. I was surprised when only 4 pieces showed up, but after finishing the plate I understood the portion size. The flavors are very strong and rich, French even. My only complaint is that they were undercooked, making the pasta hard or chewy. I was disappointed because the sauce and ingredients were first rate. Erica ordered the hanger steak and frites. I didn't have a big piece, but from all accounts it was only ok. She usually can put down a good piece of steak, but when I noticed plenty still on the plate I knew something wasn't right. By far the best course of the night was our dessert. We both ordered the apple crisp a la mode, and it was a good move to get 2. Not much needs to be said, the ice cream was delicious on top of warm apples and crust. A very well made dessert. Not to be forgotten, our 3 wine parings were also very good and we received accurate guidance when asked. Our overall experience rates a 3/5. The value on our 3 course meal with wine was great, our service and ambiance also made for an enjoyable dining experience. The quality of the food is high, but the execution/flavoring did not live up to everything else. I still would recommend checking out Gemini, and I hope to return at some point.

We were looking for some new places to check out and this looked like it' would do the trick The decor is modern and sleek, but it doesn't come off as being pretentious or overdone Most importantly, the food was really good. To start things off, we got an order of crab cakes and an order of ahi tuna tartar. The crab cakes were flat out great. There was a lot of crab meat in the cake which is always a good thing and it was real easy to pick apart with your fork. I chuckled a bit seeing the tartar as it seems like every place that aims more modern has this on their menu. It was done very well though as the cheese really added to the flavor of the tuna I got a filet mignon with steak frites. The fries were normal steak fries and weren't the thin and stringy types of frites that you sometimes get. The Filet was cooked perfectly. Perfectly tender and extremely flavorful as well.  The only slight downer was getting charged full corkage on some half bottles that were brought. We had a good amount of regular bottles on the table and had some desert wines for afterward.

2010-04-22,5.0,"Gemini Bistro just may be one of my favorite new restaurants. From start to finish, it was a fantastic experience. I met my Yelp partner in crime for one of our regular try-a-new-place evenings out. I had this place bookmarked for awhile now, so off we went. I arrived and was seated at a deuce along the half-wall in the middle of the restaurant. The decor is very sleek and contemporary, with lots of wood. It has an intimate feel and gets a lot of natural light. Keri arrived seconds later and we were greeted by our server and given menus. I had looked at (ok, memorized) the menu ahead of time and I knew I had to try one of their signature cocktails. I ordered ""The Squirtsky"", which is hard to order with a straight face, and she had a mango mojito. My drink was one of the best cocktails I've ever had. It was Finlandia grapefruit, fresh grapefruit juice, lime and club soda. The garnish was a big, juicy grapefruit segment with sugar on it. I could have drunk several of those babies, but alas, I was driving. We started with a Gemini Bistro Salad for me and a baby beet salad for her. My salad was a fairly traditional Lyonnaise, which is one of my favorite salads, but instead of a poached egg, this one had an egg milanese, which is a lightly breadcrumb-coated and fried until crispy, egg. It was an a great spin on a classic. The salad was divine. For our entrée, we decided (well, I guess I decided for us) to share the roasted whole organic chicken, which comes with a side. Since we couldn't decide on just one, we ordered two sides - the mushroom ragout and the crispy frites. The chicken came out on a platter and I couldn't wait to dive in. The skin was perfectly crispy and the chicken was really juicy, which is not often the case with roasted chicken. It was right up there with some of the best roasted chicken I've ever had. The sides were quite good too, especially the mushrooms. A variety was used - I think there were some oyster and shiitake, and it was cooked in a red-wine reduction. Utterly delicious. Nice crispy fries too. We ate and ate and still had half a chicken left. At first, I thought the $30 price tag for the chicken was steep, but it really would feed 3 people quite easily, especially with the included side. Since I had looked at the menu ahead of time, I saw that there was mushroom risotto and I was eagerly looking forward to trying that, but alas, they had sweet-pea risotto in its stead. Bummer for me, but that just gives me another excuse to go back. Even though we were stuffed, we couldn't resist sharing a dessert and ordered the warm apple crisp. The crisp arrived at the table piping hot, in a mini skillet. It had a small scoop of vanilla bean gelato on top. I could only manage one bite, but what a bite it was. The topping was an oatmeal streusel, which was nice and crumbly. It was sweet, tart, soft, and crumbly. All the major dessert components in one dish. Score! We settled our bill and as I waited in the vestibule for the valet to bring my car, I was reading some of the press articles. The cute chef/owner, Jason, came out and asked me how I liked my meal. We had a nice conversation and I remembered that he was a chef at Wave, in the W Hotel. I had always liked that restaurant and I think he was flattered that I recalled his stint there. I assured him I'd return to GB and gushed about the food some more. This is a solid restaurant from the food, to the service, to the decor. I can't wait to go back.

Sides of frites and brusell sprouts were also tasty, but by no means mind-blowing.   Salads were tasty, but portions small.  When my beet salad arrived I thought to myself ""where is the rest of it?""  But it was a baby beet salad, after all, and it still tasted good, even if it was only three man bites.   Service (waitress and hosts) was attentive and friendly, but not overbearing.  I did notice that the ""busboys"" were a little fast with clearing the plates as we finished, barely letting us swallow the last bite before swiping the plate away.  This is one of my pet peeves, so I almost certainly noticed it more than someone else might.   I would definitely go back.  Not brain warping, but compared to some other recent LP dining experiences, an overall pleasurable experience.",0.9894,0.833,0.157,0.011,0.4409688013136289

Also, BF also had some type of whisky drink that he had to let waterdown before he could sip it (totally out of character for him so it must have been strong) This is definitely a spot we'd visit again. Totally redeemed restaurant week for us. As one reviewer wrote it was very ""lincoln parkish"" as far as the crowd, but we were more focused on the food than people watching.",0.9554,0.82,0.152,0.028,0.6231060606060606

Luckily, the menu and food were great!! We all agreed that the menu items are all very safe, but good. We liked everything we ordered and there were other things I could've ordered as well. I particularly liked the salad with the egg on it (can't remember the name) and the crab cake. I ordered the swordfish for my entree and although I don't usually love swordfish, it was delicious.  The service was good, but not outstanding.  Everything else was great though.

I had made my reservation for three (me and and 2 foodie friends - including one writer) as soon as the annual RW was announced and we were all looking forward to the visit after some great reviews. When I arrived for our 7 pm reservation it was packed. This isn't a huge space either; there wasn't anywhere to stand at the bar in the back so guests were milling around near the host stand which coincidentally is also the coat check. For the course of our dinner there were various dining faux pas that occurred. Based on the professional (Tribune) and Yelp reviews though I am hoping that this was an off night and just occurred for RW. The worst was a bus boy who continually tried to clear our table...as we were still eating. My friend had mussels (off the regular menu) and she had eaten not two when the busser tried to take her bowl. Obviously the restaurant was more concerned about turning the table than our dining experience. Sigh.  There were some dining highlights including the delicious mushroom risotto and a very good winter salad. Those mentioned mussels were tasty but I definitely could have done without the coin size bites of chorizo they were cooked with. I ordered the chicken entree which was good but seemed like it was missing something. One friend ordered the steak & frites which were tasty but they were definitely fries not frites. The creme brulee was a solid ""good"". I haven't decided if I'll give Gemini a second shot yet.

After reading many stellar reviews about Gemini Bistro, I was extremely looking forward to my first dining experience there. I dined there on the first night of restaurant week and needless to say, it was completely packed with customers. Unfortunately, I did not get to try the duck confit nachos that everyone has raved about-- it wasn't even on the menu for that night! We went there for restaurant week and had the prix fixe 3 course dinner. Appetizer course was the creamless tomato soup with grilled cheese, the main entree was the steak frites, and dessert was warm german chocolate cake topped with hazelnut gelato. The steak frites was your typical steak frites-- cooked just right with golden fries. Nothing to complain or rave about when it comes to steak frites. I was mostly disappointed by the appetizer and dessert. The tomato soup was too salty and the cake was too dry. Overall, I was completely underwhelmed by my dining experience at Gemini Bistro.

We went during restaurant week but I actually opted to order off the regular menu. (Might I add, all their menus look similar so it was confusing with all the pieces of paper on the table.) The special prix fixed price really wasn't that great of a deal so I opted to just get a salad and an entree. (I am not a huge dessert person anyhow.) I had the caesar salad which was huge and pretty tasty! For my entree I had the braised short rib, which was melt in your mouth deliciousness. It was tender and was really flavorful... definitely yummy. However, I wasn't a huge fan of the side of au gratin sweet potatoes. That was just mediocre and I wish it was just mashed potatoes or something. I also tried the side of brussel sprouts (my new favorite trendy vegetable!) and the steak frites. I thought the steak was decent but the fries were just ordinary... not skinny enough nor flavored enough.

I am already planning to go back, and I definitely want to go for brunch once they resume it in May. UPDATE: Came here again a few nights later because other friends wanted to try it.  I had the French Onion Soup and the Mushroom Risotto, both very good.  Friends had the crab cake and steak frites, both big hits, as were the mashed potatoes.  Apple crumb and creme brulee were enjoyed by them as desserts.  Service was very good again.",0.9955,0.774,0.205,0.021,0.4519350961538461
2010-02-22,4.0,"Usually new restaurants can take MANY months, if not a year, to work out the kinks.  I can happily say, that Gemini Bistro seems to have it totally together after only a few months of being open!  The space is gorgeous with dark black woods and white marble bar and funky industrial lights and fixtures.  The room couldn't be more sleek, but comfortable at the same time.   My friends and I went for a birthday, and about half of us enjoyed the Restaurant Week prix-fixe, while others just chose a la carte from the menu.  I started with the mushroom risotto, which was the ONLY reason I'm not giving 5 stars.  It was so tasty, but its texture left something to be desired.  I like the creaminess of risotto when it's cooked slowly, and properly, and although their risotto did not lack flavor, it was a bit watery, or like all the liquid had not cooked down.  It did have the loveliest light, and not overpowering truffle flavor, and perfectly cooked mushrooms.  Now, for my entree I got the chicken, and  I'm NEVER usually one to order a roast chicken when I'm out to dinner.  Typically opt for fish, shellfish or steak, but I am so glad I tried the Amish chicken because it was amazingly tasty!  It literally melted on my fork like butter.  I would go back for that.  For my dessert I got the apple crisp/dumpling thing which was a perfect size with crisp, yet tender apples, crumbly oatmeal, a little cinnamon, and they drizzled a vanilla anglaise tableside.  Yum.  Perfect end-cap to a great meal!  Everyone continuously spoke about the tastiness of their entrees and appetizers as well, which included, Tuna, Swordfish and Hangar Steak.  After dinner we enjoyed a few cocktails at the beautiful bar, which was fun!  I wanted to try the Stoli Red apple vodka, which i had never tried, and the bartender suggested that she make me an apple/cucumber martini with it.  I frowned thinking....""apple martini???""""""...instantly thinking of the terrible green sour-apple pucker you'd normally get.  It wasn't that at all.  The red-apple vodka was mellow and sweet, and the cucumber cut any sour there would have been.  I could sit at that bar & drink those 'tinis all day everyday.

2010-02-15,4.0,"Went to Gemini Bistro for Valentine's Day - although it was a day early.  The space was sleek and had almost a 20's feel to it, the only thing that was missing, we decided, was a tile floor.  But that's nitpicking to say the least. The bar area looked great for an after work cocktail and the room was lively and fun; hopefully not to be described as 'loud' by others. With a friendly waitress who was clearly knowledgeable, we asked several question ranging from the portion size, her favorite food and an appropriate wine pairing for our meal. She was available without being forward, and this seemed to be the norm from other waiters and staff we saw at the space. As far as the food goes, I was thrilled to see the Creamless Tomato Soup on the menu - served with a small grilled cheese.  The soup was hot and had a creamy texture, despite not having any cream in it.  The grilled cheese was warm and on fresh bread.  My girlfriend's beet salad made me a beet lover for the first time.  With arugula and feta cheese with balsamic, I have found a new salad option. For entrees, I had the steak frites, which was exactly as I had hope for: tender meat and crispy fries.  My girlfriend had the braised short rib per our server's suggestion and it was also tender with a great aioli We were too full for dessert and opted for an after-dinner coffee.  $12 for Bailey's and coffee never sits well, but it certainly didn't ruin a fantastic meal and a new local restaurant as the rest of the cocktails were appropriately priced.

I was hosting a birthday party for my dearest and bestest friend, so I wanted to make sure everything went smoothly. Reservations were booked on open table, but when I called about 10 times to change the number of people attending (really, it wasn't me, it was all the other guests...get it together people!!!) they were very good-natured and happily recalculated my reservation.  And when I called 30 minutes before to ask them to move it back (even though the table was already set and they could have served others with those tables) they gladly accomdated me, which saved me a lot of stress and worry.  AND....when I arrived they immediately ushered me over to our table, were helpful in helping me set up my decorations, favors, etc., and even had a gift table set up off to the side. AMAZING! It's the little things that count. Now onto the menu. They have small, medium, and ""large"" plates, although let's be honest, the large aren't really that large. But what they lack in saize they make up for in flavor, and this would be a great place to order a bunch of things for the table and share. Which we sort of did, and sort of didn't. I ordered the beet salad to start (YUMMMY) and then the mushroom risotto (it was good too). Scuba Steve had the short rib (no, not a typo, it's literally once rib but a fairly good size...although not big enough to feed a man his size) which came with squash and was excellent. Overall between the 13 of us that were there I think we sampled one of everything off the menu - and everyone keep oohing and aahhing over how good everything was. Drinks were good as well - the mango mojito is a must - however one drawback was that I asked for my regular vodka press (a press is half soda, half seven, and lots of vodka, flavored preferred by yours truly) I was served something that had vodka in it, but didn't even remotely resemble a press. I just wish they would have asked if they didn't know what it was...I get asked all the time and I'm okay with that - would much rather explain than get a crappy drink. But hey, it had alcohol in it so I suffered through it (slurped it down to move on to my next libation) and then soldiered on. Wines were good too.... When all was said and done, it ended up being about $90 per person, including booze, one small plate and one medium/large plate.  Plus, valet is $8 - not a bad deal in the city!

2009-12-16,4.0,"This place is a solid four stars.   So you're driving on Lincoln Ave, and....wait...that's not a Countrywide Mortgage office anymore, that's a new restaurant.!  So we go in.  An earlier review said that walking into Gemeni Bistro is like walking into a Banana Republic.  Truer words were never spoken.  But you forget about that, because people are SO incredibly nice to you.  A host and a hostess greeted us right away, and told us they would come get us at the bar.  It was a Tuesday night, and it was surprisingly packed.  What recession?  One Whisky Sour and one Squirtsky later (my lady approved of her drink), we were escorted to our table.  Top notch service.  They split their menu into ""small"" (individual sized things like soups or salads), ""medium"" (apps), and ""large"" (entrees). We wanted to try a bunch of stuff, so we decided to forgo entrees, and stick with ""small"" and ""large"" menu items.  We both had the winter salad, which was comprised of dried cherries, walnuts, and copious amounts of addictive narcotics.  That last ingredient is a guess, because I couldn't get enough of what seemed like just a nice salad.  For the next round, we shared PEI mussels, ""Bacon & Eggs"", and blanched brussel sprouts sauteed in white wine.  A few things: - ""Bacon & Eggs"" reminded me of something that that guy ""Kevin"" from ""Top Chef"" would have cooked if it were a breakfast quickfire challenge.  Braised pork belly, quail egg, pancake and cherry syrup.  As good as it sounds. - PEI Mussels: good.  Not great, but good PEI mussels.  - Blanched brussel sprouts: The chef here needs to talk with my mom and walk her through how he cooks brussel sprouts.  Good stuff. Sorry, Mom.  Dessert: we ordered ""Cagney's Warm Skillet Sunday"".  The full name of this dessert item is ""Cagney's Warm Skillet Sunday That You Don't Care Who Judges You For Eating Because It's Awesome"".  8"" Skillet + cookie on the bottom + ice cream on top = screw you for judging me, this is awesome Our waiter was extremely knowlegeable, really friendly, and very funny.  At the end of the meal, he asked for our valet ticket so they could have our car waiting and warmed up for us when we left.   The only reason I am not giving this place a five is because (going back to the Top Chef analogy), the menu overall is like the stuff the contestants invent mid-season on ""Top Chef"".  During the middle of the season on ""Top Chef"", everyone is doing ""familiar with a twist"", but standing out with new ideas is a risk.  The food at Gemini Bistro is good, solid food, that is something you recognize, but with a small twist.  I think the menu needs some more adventure to it. I also think that they are capable of doing this.  Maybe it is their strategy to play it safe right now, since it's a recession, and much like ""Top Chef"", why experiment dangerously at this early stage? I understand if that's the case.    This is a good solid restaurant. I would (and will) go back.  I think over time they will potentially become a really good restaurant.  They just need to create a few rotating items that really blow you away.  They also need to stock Matilda beer, but that's just me.",0.9974,0.782,0.18,0.038,0.4731989403631195

2009-11-14,3.0,"We have driven by this place 20 times and thought it looked pleasantly surprising for the surrounding venues.  Finally, we made reservations.  We had 9:00 reservations, and ended up sitting at the bar waiting for a table until 9:45.  I was impressed by how crowded it was!  While waiting was not fun they did give us a free round of cocktails and a free appetizer to make up for the wait which went a long way with us.  That being said, the food and drink just wasn't all that good. I started with a dirty martini which was fine, my fiance had the mango mojito which she had already picked out prior to our arrival.  It was OK- kind of sour, but nice fresh mango flavor. We each started with a bowl of soup.  I had the lobster bisque my fiance had the tomato soup with grilled cheese.  Hers was great, mine was borderline inedible.  They had fresh pieces of lobster in the bisque which was nice, but the bisque itself was so salty it bordered on being sent back.  The bread that accompanied the soup was kind of dry and certainly below average. For our appetizers we got the crabcake and the braised short rib ravioli (yes I know braised short rib as a ravioli filling- amazing right?).  The crabcake was very good, nice fresh chunks of crab with a light salad and cream sauce.  The braised short rib ravioli I'm sad to say was very bland- it came with a sweet sundried tomato puree which made them a lot better- still for how excited we were when we read it off the menu, a disappointment.  We then shared the halibut- the fish was fresh and well cooked, the sauce was overpowering and a little bit of a weird flavor to couple with a white fish- it tasted almost like the spicy mayo commonly paired with sushi rolls. Given we got a couple glasses of nice wine $110 including tax and tip was quite reasonable for a fancy dinner in Chicago- I just wasn't overwhelmed with the flavors- super nice staff though.",0.9963,0.743,0.206,0.05,0.6143634596695822

Other people had the scallops, which were really good, the salmon, the short ribs.. and the list goes on. Everything was extremely good.

2009-11-01,4.0,"I'm going to start with a couple of complaints: (1)  We went to Gemini Bistro on a Friday night with 8 p.m. reservations.  We were not seated until 8:30 p.m.  I understand that it was crowded, but this is unacceptable under any circumstance.  The hostess was very apologetic and they did provide our table with a complimentary appetizer, which certainly went a long way to making me feel better about the whole thing.  (2)  We were seated in the tables along the bar.  The bar area was so packed that it made it very difficult for our server to wait on our table without being continually jostled.  This was not inconvenient for us--aside from the volume of the room (which was loud, but not unbearable)--and our waitress was more than pleasant, but honestly could not have been comfortable under those circumstances. Now, I don't tend to complain a whole lot in these reviews, but I point those out here because the rest of the dining experience was so exceptional (frankly near perfect) that with several small tweaks I think that Gemini Bistro could become one of the premier restaurants in Chicago at its price point. My dinner mates commented that eating at Gemini Bistro is kind of like eating in a Banana Republic--neutral grey tones and textures.  Shortly after we were seated we were given some Duck Confit Nachos.  They were phenomenal--the duck was great and it was covered with several different layers of cheese, fruit and vegetables.  A great combination. I started with a Yia-Yia Salad.  A simple, but superb, take on a traditional greek salad.  Monica had a tomato soup, which was also spectacular. I had lobster ravioli as an entree.  It was served in a really, really delicate cream sauce.  Now I haven't thought that I liked cream sauces.  But I made a point of telling our busboy and our waitress to tell the chef that that was one of the best sauces I have had on anything in a long time.  The lobster raviolis were very well cooked and very well garnished with some lobster chunks and greens. Monica had a crabcake which I thought was tasty.  It was almost all crab meat, but it was well seasoned and perfectly cooked. The highlight of the evening was the dessert.  We had an apple crumble that was simply the greatest dessert I have ever eaten in my life.  Honestly.  I used to think that apple crumbles were simple, homey things that I'd get at mom's house for Sunday dinner.  This was that on a culinary school education.  It was rich and creamy and crunchy and buttery and cinnamony and appley and honestly as I am writing this all I want to do is go and eat some more of that.   Frankly, we had another dessert on the table (which I remember as being good), but I have completely forgotten what it was--simply because that apple crumble was so fantastic.

That kind of atmosphere is my favorite: upscale food, unpretentious surroundings. The decor is very cool, too. Minimal and not fussy.  Yes, the portion sizes aren't huge, but the food was great. Another thumbs up for the duck nachos, which are a great app to split. That plus salads and main entrees made a pretty perfectly sized meal.

But I digress...we got here around 8p after the question was popped.  While sitting at the bar waiting for our table, the bartender made us two awesome shots as a congratulations on the house.  Everyone was so friendly.  We sat at a table for 6 in the back part of the room.  The ambiance was great- busy and chic without being uppitty or pretentious.  We ordered a crab cake to share, and it was honestly one of the best crab cakes I've ever had.  There was WAY more crab to filler, it was delicious.  My fiance and I shared the steak, which was definitely large enough to share without being over the top large.  The mashed potatoes we had with it were delicious too- we both wished there were more than just the little side. Everyone at the table loved what they received, including tuna tartare, scallops, and veal (although we thought the veal was a tad small on the portion size). The big highlight was the cookie skillet Zac brought us for dessert.  It was insanely good.  Without a doubt, I would go back for a special occassion (it's a tad on the pricey side)...I'd even go there just for the crab cake and skillet cookie...and of course, the awesome service by Zac!!!",0.9967,0.743,0.236,0.021,0.5614285714285715
2009-10-19,4.0,"If you walk past Gemini Bistro while strolling down this stretch of Lincoln Avenue, you might wonder ""What's a nice place like this doing on Sports-bar Boulevard?"".  For a long time I've considered Lincoln south of Fullerton to be pretty much a culinary dead zone, but decided to give this place a try after seeing it written up in Time Out Chicago. Gemini's dinner menu is split up into S, M, L, and XL choices, which I suppose is nice when it comes to portion control and sharing.  We tried the Bistro Salad (good) and Duck Confit Nachos (really really good, though I was wishing that the topping-to-chip ratio had been a bit more substantial).  Then we went for two ""Large""-class entrees - scallops and short ribs - which were great but frankly not terribly ""Large"" - maybe more like very roomy Mediums?? At any rate, that left us plenty of room for dessert - we chose the warm skillet sundae which ended up being the highlight of the meal.  It's served in a hot skillet with a big, warm, mooshy chocolate chip cookie at the bottom, topped with gelato and whipped cream.  Heavenly but definitely too big & rich for one person to consume - be prepared to share!

2009-09-24,4.0,"Gemini astrological reading for the day:  You will be hospitable and inviting and have a flair for entertaining.  Yep. That's just what I found the other night at the Gemini Bistro. Named after the astro twins of Gemini, this new bistro does a great job of pulling it all together.  First- the building. Located in an art deco building in a space that used to house a pharmacy- this contemporary space is warm and welcoming. From the dark wood floors, to the white marble bar, to the sconces on the walls and the dramatic down lighting over the bar, Gemini Bistro is a delight for the eyes. If there is a downside- it is a bit loud as there is little to soften the noise in the place.  We were seated immediately and our server (who was great, personable and friendly- thanks Christine) explained the menu to us. There are small, medium, large and x large plates on the menu. Easy to understand- the small plates are appetizers meant for one moving all the way up to the xlarge section which housed a whole chicken.  We ordered the tuna tartar (delicious with a little kick coming from the chilies) and the crab cake (with Tabasco aioli- terrific!) to start.  For our entrees- we went with the halibut (good) and the chicken breast with mushrooms (quite tasty). For our sides were some of the creamiest mashed potatoes ever along with some baby spinach.  For dessert we tried the key lime pie (not the winner of the night but interesting with the caramel sauce drizzle) and the triple chocolate cake (now that was calorie worthy!)  I ran into the owner, Ryan O'Donnell, who I knew from his other places around town who was great at telling me his plans and vision for the place. He has partnered with Chef Jason Paskewitz who used to work at Wave and Sushi Samba and is now turning out some great food at the Gemini Bistro  Prices are reasonable for the quality of the food served (entrees run about $16 - $22) and there is valet parking for $8 as parking is a bit of a challenge in this neck of the woods.  Back to the astrological sign namesake. Let's hope that the flighty side of Gemini doesn't rear it's ugly head anytime soon- as this is one new place that looks full of promise for the long haul.",0.9935,0.868,0.129,0.004,0.5672113997113997

The food was all good, we sampled a fair amount of the brunch menu and the entire group which has varying palates were all pleased.

The tea and water was always refilled, the waitress was great (didn't forget a thing and always with a smile) and the little extras made it a 5 star experience. I was definitely looking forward to checking it out, because we go to brunch every weekend and I'm always searching for the perfect Steak and Eggs Benedict (which unfortunately they didn't have). It's also great because it's open both Saturday and Sunday at 9am (which is nice for people with kids who can actually roll out of bed before 11am). After we ordered, they surprised us with a complimentary order of the most moist delicious mini donuts ever. I ordered the Croque Madame (added tomato to it) and it was insanely fabulous--5 star! My better half ordered the Chorizo Scramble, which he claimed was too bland. I certainly couldn't tell by the time I tasted it because he had drenched it in tabasco, but nevertheless; my son was thrilled with his choc chip pancakes. Lastly, because we were their first brunch customers, they surprised us with a complimentary key lime pie--which was top notch.

When we first walked in the room the atmosphere was vibrant, like it was the  ""the new cool place to be"". The menu is very well thought out. A little bit of everything. Love the small, medium, large and x-large plate idea because it gives you the ability to dine tapas-style or in more traditional form. We had the lobster gazpacho which was amazing and the Gemini Bistro salad with an egg Milanese. The egg Milanese was definitely a new one for me. Outstanding. We followed with the jumbo pan friend scallops. The cioppino was again outstanding. incredibly well seasoned and the scallops cooked perfectly. Our next serving was the veal and steak frites both which were excellent. The steak could not have been better. finally getting to the desserts, the key lime pie is probably on the top of my favorite key lime pie list. The bueberry shortcake is another gem in the selection. Wine list is ample and affordable. Martinis are awesome. Overall a very good experience.
