The front is more laid back with a bar and casual dining, and the formal dining room is large and situated right behind the bar. In simple terms, it's an upscale yet lively restaurant in which an order of oysters, crab, and lobster cannot be wrong. We went with our good friends at their behest and ordered appetizers - oysters Rockefeller and Maryland style crab cakes. Both were great choices and just right as to not spoil an appetite. I ordered the King Crab which is their specialty, and split it because I wasn't too hungry. The butter was delicious with the crab and easy to carve out from the shell. Additionally we all shared 2 sides, the creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin (both were highly recommended). Finally, we all decided to share the key lime pie which my wife stated was the best she has ever had.

2017-08-06,4.0,"I was a little hesitant before coming here because the thought of spending ~$80 (after tax and tip) for brunch was a bit of a turnoff. However as a huge crab lover (and because of my adamant friends), we decided to come here for Sunday brunch. And honestly, this was some of the best crab I've had in Illinois. It tasted super fresh, was all sweet and salty. They even cut it up and break it for you to make it easier to eat. While it is buffet style, the crab is actually served by someone behind the counter, so you have to ask for them to serve you. The trick is, though, to have zero shame and just ask for double portions every time. I had maybe 8-10 servings by the end. Another honorable mention was the caramelized bacon. It was cooked exactly how I like my bacon (not really crispy, and a little chewy) and was ridiculously good.   Besides the food, the service was incredible. I drink crap tons of water and I never had an empty glass. The servers were really attentive which made the whole meal better. If you're hankering for some really good crab, then look no further.

Your first steps into the establishment immediately make you think you've walked back in time. The lighting, the ambiance, everything about it was just so... timeless. That alone was a compelling reason for me to enjoy the restaurant. Admittedly, I didn't get a chance to try much of the menu. I was there for the oyster happy hour! $18 gets you a dozen with a selection of one west coast and one east coast oyster. $11 gets you a wine pairing for oysters - either a muscadet or, I think?, Chardonnay. The oysters are presented beautifully, with the vinegar in the form of crushed ice, which I loved, and make a beautiful Instagram photo - if that's what you're into.  A couple, maybe two out of three dozen, of the oysters had some flakey shell in them which wasn't ideal but understandable given the crowd, rush to shuck, and the nature of the business in general. Our server, Danielle, was fantastic, funny, and accommodating in every way with prompt service and always keeping an eye on the table generally. I definitely intend on going back again sometime to try out the rest of the items on the menu!

Shaw's is a massive restaurant with classy, old-school vibes.  It has a large bar area, casual Oyster bar, and a full dining room with red leather couches.  The menu is truly massive with every-type of seafood and preparation imaginable.  Service from Anthony was excellent.  Overall the food was excellent too, so 4 stars! We ordered a crustacean-centric dinner of course: Apps: We shared a 1-lb entree of chilled, jumbo stone crab claws from Santa Barbara.  We're used to the Florida ones, but apparently they were out of season.  Three large claws with super-sweet meat just like we remembered from Joe's.  The spicy mustard dip enhances the flavor for sure.  (5 stars) Soups: Gumbo was classic New-Orleans style but they added some fish meat. Smokey and thick. (4 stars). Lobster Bisque was rich and creamy (4 stars). Entrees:  A tale of two crabs?  My wife ordered the 1.25-lb plate of Alaskan King Crab legs.  Plenty of meat, most of it sweet, but the texture and cook seemed a bit uneven.  She had a few pieces that seemed overcooked and on the dry side.  Other pieces were moist and perfect.  Strange.  (3 stars). She regretted a little by not getting more Stone Crabs instead.   I opted for the Signature dish of king crab and 6-oz filet, and both of my items were perfect.  My crab included claws and shorter sections of legs but everything was moist and sweet! I even shared a bunch with the wife.  The cook on the filet was medium rare like I like it.  Nice cheesy, horse-radish crust. (5 stars). Dessert: We shared a slice of their key lime pie.  Thick, light, and very tart with a nice cookie-crumble crust for sweetness (4 stars). As I mentioned earlier, Shaw's is great and a welcome introduction dinner to Chicago.  The king crab leg quality seems a bit uneven, while the stone crab and Signature crab and filet rocked.",0.9982,0.772,0.215,0.013,0.5889858906525571

We had a boat tour scheduled at 7:30, so we headed here to catch a meal before our departure. This place (obviously) specializes in crab and seafood, but they do have steak and one pasta dish (lobster fettuccini). Their seafood is seasonal and fresh, and often comes from fishing families that the restaurant knows personally. I thought the restaurant area was very nice. The decor was sophisticated and classic. Seemingly high end. The atmosphere was in line with your typical fine dining establishment. Lighting was a bit dim. Most people come dressed up, so I'd recommend wearing something nice. The menu was decently sized with a lot of great options. Prices weren't too outrageous, with most entrees ranging in the $30-40 range. Our party of 5 ordered the grand cold shellfish platter to start. This came with maine lobster tails, oysters on the half shell, shrimp, maryland blue crab fingers, and alaskan red king crab bites. Everything was very fresh and delicious. The lobster tails, shrimp, and oysters tasted particularly good. The oysters tasted among the freshest I've had. After the appetizer, I decided to order a bowl of clam chowder, priced at $9. For my main course, I ordered the grilled antlantic yellowfin tuna, priced at $37. The clam chowder was good, but didn't blow me away. It was very heavy and filling. It was definitely above average, just not the best I've had. The yellowfin tuna was superb. Cooked medium rare, this sashimi-grade fish came with a raw center just how I wanted it. The ginger-soy vinaigrette complemented the fish well. It was to die for. Obviously fresh and definitely a quality piece of fish. All in all, Shaw's was able to meet my somewhat high expectations. I was impressed by most everything I tried. I forgot to mention that I also got to eat some soft shell crab, which was pretty cool. I had never had it before, and found it interesting yet tasty. It was pretty good. Everything else was great. Service, ambiance, decor - no complaints. Go ahead and check this place out! Reservations on a Saturday night around 530 weren't necessary, but it did start to get crowded towards the end of our meal.",0.9983,0.758,0.211,0.032,0.597053946053946

2017-06-10,5.0,"My wife and I ate here for or last meal after a few days in Chicago. This place was recommended to us by a colleague of mine that travels a lot for business. If you are looking for a SOLID seafood restaurant, rest easy. Your search stops here. To start my wife had a glass of red wine and I had the Bloody Mary. It was delicious. And it comes with a pickle and a shrimp. Need I say more? We shared the crab bites as an app and they were delicious. So was the spicy mayo that comes with them. We split a Ceasar salad which was great as well. Fresh lettuce and an anchovy on each serving. Not too much and not too little dressing which I have found often plagues some places Ceasar Salads. For dinner we decided to stick relatively local and get fishes from the Great Lakes. We shared the Walleye and the Whitefish. Both were cooked perfectly, tasted great and had excellent sides. The potatoes with horseradish sauce that accompanied the Whitefish was especially delicious. We skipped dessert as we were so full from the meal but had coffees strong and fresh. As far as ambiance IMO it's as good as it gets for a classic seafood restaurant. Step up your game and wear a jacket it's a nice place. The service was great. Our waiter was attentive, and when asked about the difference between Walleye and Whitefish and Perch clearly knew his stuff. Too many expensive restaurant nowadays employ less than knowledgeable wait staff - this is not one of those places. If you're in town and looking for a classy night out, or a local that is lucky enough to have this place close by I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.",0.995,0.78,0.202,0.018,0.5792792792792791

Service was good and they made sure to keep our table clear of old plates and over-flowing oyster and crab leg shells.

Six different types of oysters, 2 of each, were served up in order of briney delight. Almost ordered another dozen just for myself as a dinner.  Our dinner selection consisted of the Halibut special for my wife and I had the crab cakes. The Halibut was beautiful seared and served up on a bed of spring veggies. My crab cakes meet all expectations, firm enough to be a cake while not over done, spicy enough for flavor while not overpowering the crab. Got to say, Ok write, that I dig the selection options at Shaw's from formal dinning to old time oyster bar.

It had very little rice, all fresh seafood and truly a rainbow of color. The crab inside was perfect. The pickled ginger was juicy, not dry.  The original intent was to then get chowder (it was raining outside and soup weather) and then fish. But the sushi was so good, we decided to get more. We ordered the same roll but this time only salmon sashimi. We decided to add one of the New Style Sashimi's- the yellowtail. It had Granny Smith apple, basil, mint, basil oil, and a pepper vinaigrette. It was a great choice and we enjoyed every delicious bite of the unique 4 piece dish.

We arrived a little early, so while waiting we grabbed a drink at the bar. Shortly after we were sat right away so no problem there. Menus (very LARGE menus that took up a a large part of our very small table) were delivered and our server gave us the lowdown. She was very knowledgeable about the specials and oysters so that was a plus as well.  While enjoying our drinks, my husband took the last sip of his beer (draft) and pulled a very strange, blackish stringy thing from his mouth. I have absolutely no idea what it was but, gross! I brought it to the servers attention and the manager promptly came over and offered a beverage on the house.  Alright, moving on.. oyster sampler. Our favorite were the Saquish (east coast) .. the rest were very irony.  The lobster bisque was a must for us. It was different though. Not in a bad way either.. it was not like any I have tasted and I was pleasantly surprised. Nutmeg and cinnamon flavors & not heavily creamy. Pretty good stuff.  For our entrees, we ordered the halibut special and king crab legs. The halibut was perfectly cooked and delicious. Crab legs were on point. We decided on the cauliflower for our side and I could've done without that.  Why three stars? Our drinks were empty for quite some time & I had to flag down a manager for another one, that mysterious substance that came out of my husbands glass and the service.

Husband enjoyed our bartender's suggestion for a lighter beer and I enjoyed a perfect martini. The clam chowder was delicious according to my husband and we both enjoyed the fresh bread and butter.  We were then seated in the beautiful dining room which is a throwback to a more formal and sophisticated time. Loved the music and ambiance. I mentioned to the host and later our waiter that we were celebrating a birthday to which the both wished my husband a Happy Birthday. Service was okay...husband's filet was served without a steak knife although the flavor was good. The crab leg was tasty and fresh. Waiter then noticed the lack of steak knife and brought one over. My Caesar salad was good if not too heavily dressed. The oysters on the other hand, meh. I ordered a half dozen, 3 east coast and 3 west coast, and was completely underwhelmed. The miniscule size of all, the east coast particularly was surprising. I doubled them on my fish fork just to be able to sink my teeth into something.  In the end I was hoping a celebratory dessert would make up for the oyster shortcomings, but alas no such luck.

2017-03-20,4.0,"Took my wife here based on a recommendation of a friend. I told him I wanted to go to Joe's, but he recommended here instead.  It was okay, but not amazing. They have a larger selection of crabs versus Joe's. But if you want in season Stone Crab, Joe's executes far better.  Claws at Shaw's were not cracked as well as at Joe's so it took a little more work.  When we got there on time for our reservation we were told it would be a 30 minute wait. We eventually snagged a table at the bar.  The server seemed a little put out that we were there, but he took decent care of us.  It was pricey as expected, but I think for your money you can get better.  Maybe I am just bias cause I love Joe's so much, but I doubt I will go to Shaw's again when I can get friendlier service and consistent quality for a similar price right down the road.  Update: After my above (3 star first review), I was contacted immediately by management. They apologized for a less than stellar experience, and offered me an incentive to return.  I declined the incentive, but agreed to try it again on my next business trip to Chicago. On March 15th, 2017 I returned. At the recommendation of the person who contacted me, I sat at the Oyster Bar. Overall the experience was much better. Very prompt and polite service by the bartender. I had a few Stone Crab claws. It is really nice that you can order them per claw there versus having to order a pound. The claws were nice and fresh. I then had some lobster bisk. It was good, but nothing amazing. I then had the hot appetizer plate. It was a nice combo of calamari, crab, lobster, and oysters. The butter poached oysters were a real treat. While I stand by my initial assessment that Joe's is a better experience if you are looking specifically for Stone Crab, Shaw's has a much much broader menu and slightly better pricing. When craving seafood in Chicago, I will return to Shaw's.  The fact that I was contacted after my review and they requested a second chance says to me these folks do care about their quality and service.

2017-03-13,5.0,"We are visiting from Dallas and decided to to go Shaw's Crab House for a nice dinner. The decor there feels very old school Chicago, but in a good way. The ambiance was really nice. We started out with soup as an appetizer, the lobster bisque for me and seafood gumbo for my husband. Lobster bisque is one of my favorite foods, so if it's on the menu I always order it. This bisque was a bit different. The brandy flavor was there, but the base wasn't the creamy bisque I was used to. Plus there were julianne carrots and zucchini added as well. Overall it was very good, but not your typical lobster bisque. The gumbo was a traditional gumbo and well executed. We shared a wedge salad as our second course and I highly recommend this. It's listed as a double wedge salad on the menu, and our split servings were the perfect size. The herb vinaigrette was a nice change from the typical bleu cheese dressing, and the bacon and tomato added contrast. We then had the club combination as our main course. It included a petite filet mignon, three sautéed scallops over spinach, three grilled shrimp and asparagus. It also included a ramekin of garlic butter and a lemon wedge. I also added the oscar topping which included large pieces of crab and hollandaise sauce. It was nice, but not really necessary with all the other flavors on the plate. I wasn't able to finish even half of the club combination as it was a very large serving of protein. My husband's dirty vodka martini was perfect and he followed it with a nice malbec. I had the King Island pinot grigio and it was great with my meal. We declined dessert and opted for another round of wine instead. Our server surprised us with a piece of key lime pie on the house and my husband loved it! When our entree arrived, we cut into one of our filets and it was way overdone. Our server whisked it away without us saying a word and a new filet was delivered quickly. The service was truly exceptional. We go to upscale steakhouses all the time in Dallas, and most of the time the meals don't quite meet our expectations for the money. This is the first steakhouse we've ever been to that was worth every penny. If you are ever in Chicago, go to Shaw's! You won't regret it!",0.9968,0.823,0.163,0.014,0.6295793095793095

I'm not a fan of raw oysters anyways so I stayed away from that. The cocktail shrimp was decent, kind of what you'd expect. Next I had the house mixed greens salad which I honestly didn't care much for. My neighbor and I were discussing this as we were eating our salad and were disappointed in the quality. The greens seemed old and foliage-like. Next I had the scallops. I normally LOVE scallops, they're one of my favorite things to order at restaurants. However, I found these to be bland and kind of run-of-the-mill. Ended the night with Crème Brule which I actually enjoyed. I wouldn't say my dining experience was bad, but it wasn't what I'd expect from this type of restaurant given the location, ambiance, and the $$$ it costs. This is the type of quality I'd expect from a TGIF or the sort. Needless to say, I won't be choosing to come back here on my own.

I spoke with someone from upper management, who was hospitable in the 5-star fashion I expected from the establishment from the get-go. In our discussion, it was clear that our feelings were mutual in that both sides were disappointed at the poor experience I had, and that both sides wanted to make sure there won't be future guests that experience what I had. I am confident that they will work towards efforts in appropriately training their staff, as well as working on a couple of other minor concerns to just bring overall general improvement. Everything and everyone is a work in progress. As a place with over 1500 reviews already, they could have easily swept mine under the bus and disregarded it as bologna. But they didn't. They took my critique with stride, and I believe that is commendable and shows the true heart of the place.  I've upped my rating to 3 stars as I believe their efforts to communicate with me gives them 5 stars in hospitality, but a true 5-star rating from me won't be earned until I return.

I will preface this next part by saying that I don't know if they have crawfish on their menu seasonally or just decided to do it the week of Mardi Gras. However, if you are going to offer a crawfish boil on your menu I would recommend researching any of the thousand styles of doing a crawfish boil. From what I could tell, the bugs were boiled in water with corn and potatoes and not even a tablespoon of spices. Usually you would expect there to be at least 10 lbs. of spice in the water until it is rolling black and all of that flavor is absorbed in to the corn, meat and potatoes or at the very least seasoned on the crawfish afterwards.  I will continue to come here for the oysters and beer but was really hoping to find a good spot near the loop to get spicy crawfish this season.",0.9715,0.874,0.126,0.0,0.41859649122807024

Shaws is divided into two sides; the dining room and the oyster bar. My favorite experience is the oyster bar, though I've dined in their rather grand dining room at least twice before. I suggest saving the dining room for special occasions... as it seems to be a bit fancy, even for a date night. The dining room seems to remind most people of the restaurant in The Shining. So the oyster bar is totally opposite of what we'll call the Redrum Room. It's lively, more interactive and transitions from a perfect lunch spot, to a happy hour with decent deals, to a jazz venue, with live music kicking up at 7pm Monday through Thursdays. They also do a pretty mean NYE and if you sweet talk the hostess, she might give you a coveted reservation. All the seafood is fresh... and while I do wish the oyster happy hour overlapped the live jazz... I'll take the tasty experiences as I find them.

I didn't particularly care for the crab cakes and didn't bother wasting stomach space on vegetables. I also didn't care for the donuts (didn't try them) or the maple bacon.

Actual dining experience was superb.  Only qualm was....our reservation was pretty early, by Chicago terms, and we HAD a reservation....yet the hostess sat us at the oddest table considering: near the door, bar and bus station.  When the place was 80% empty.  Odd.   Poor seating was quickly overcome by impeccable service.  Wine recommendations from our server were on point, bread/water etc service from the bussers was efficient and attentive, and the food menu recommendations from the (same) server were just as on point as the wine.  I appreciate honesty and not just pointing me to the highest priced drink or grub.  Horseradish encrusted filet may have been the best steak I've ever, ever had.  My partner raved about the lobster bisque and the seafood platter entree.  All of our sides and other apps were delish, too, but the entrees stole the show - as they should!  Everything that touched our table was worth writing home to Yelp about, it was that good.

Both times here, I was on a date and this is a great setting for it whether you want the oyster bar or the traditional sit down tables. Staff: I've never had such an attentive waiter. They lined up in the back wall and when I glanced over, my waiter started walking towards me immediately. Even though the place was full, you still felt as if you were getting special treatment. Cocktails: I got Shaw's Bloody Mary; 42 below vodka, spicy tomato mix, olives, lime, celery, pickle, jumbo shrimp. It was probably the best cocktail I've had. Everything mixed in very well and contributed to the taste. Food: They have a traditional seafood menu with a hearty portion size for all the dishes. You won't need to worry about leaving hungry. I barely had room for dessert, but I managed to squeeze it in. The highlight for me is their clam chowder. It's creamy, not chunky and the texture is smooth. Taste is seasoned perfectly with the right balance of clams and other veges inside. Also ordered the Hot Appetizer Combo consisting of Fried Calamari, Mini Crab Cake and French Fried Shrimp. First time I came here, I got the Alaskan King Crab which the waiter kindly broke most of the legs to draw the meat out upon arrival of the dish. Second time, I got the Surf and Surf which was Alaskan King Crab and a Lobster Tail (this was extremely filling). As for the sides sauteed garlic spinach and hash browns. Honestly, I could have gone without the hash browns, but why not? My date got Filet Mignon both times, and said it was only ""okay"". Well this /is/ a seafood place. For dessert, I ordered the Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and Hot Fudge. Delicious, not too overbearingly sweet and I felt as if the chocolate fudge from the small cup went on forever.

Each side seemed to have a bar, and they had the same menu. Great menu btw - lots options for differing palates - oysters, fish, steak, sushi, salads, soups... We went to the right. This night they had a live and really good Blues band. The service was so great -- efficient, not pushy, quick to set up and clear plates. (shout out to Sandra) And the food was SO GOOD. Nothing was less than exceptional. Broccoli with cheese sauce - so cool. Yellowtail roll - so good. Lobster fettuccine WINNER!! A big of spice and plenty lobster. Scallops - they are the small ones, so there was a lot to eat, and perfectly cooked.  Dessert sampler was the best. ($10! Bargain) Tip: get it ""ala mode"" and you get a small scoop of homemade ice cream for $1.50. Don't pass up the hot fudge either -- this ain't no hershey's syrup. The pecan pie was so good; raspberry pie also good; whipped cream piped on the side of each was great; and keylime pie which I normally don't like was SO GOOD.

Experience is always stellar, whether you're seated in the finer dinner-style area, versus the more casual oyster bar, complete with bar, TV's, and bar-height tables and highchairs. Wait staff remains knowledgeable. Attentive, even while busy. Oh, but the service. If you want to feel like you're being treated and really going for a night out, you'll get that attention here. I'm not crazy for the complimentary bread at all, but on to food. Oysters. Always great, duh. Fresh, and ever-changing, although I'd recommend happy hour for 1/2-off oysters. But I'm always impressed. about 4-6 selections for east coast shells, and 4-6 selections for west coasters. Lobster bisque: my soup of choice. It's a bit thinner, not chunky, but creamy and delicious. You won't get heaping chunks of lobster here, but it will hold your appetite at bay until your food arrives. It's definitely flavorful (although I've had better bisque elsewhere). Still, not too salty, and the cream is on point. This night, I ordered the lobster fettucine. Distracted, I didn't realize it was served with a white wine sauce, rather than alfredo. When I was ordering however, I told him I wanted them to make it hearty, more buttery, more creamy, etc.... so I guess somewhere we had miscommunication, because I wanted more of the soul-food hearty kind of dinner. This was definitely the more lighter version. I tried it, and it actually was more spicy. No cream at all. I hate hate hate wasting food, and I asked him if there was any way the cooks can just make up another batch of fettucine or even some sort of cream sauce. they couldn't, but it really wasn't what I wanted either, and I couldn't handle the kick of spice since my stomach was off that day. I just hated that they had to waste the lobster (I hate wasting life!!!!!)  but I guess that's the business. I replaced my order with bay scallops, cooked in garlic butter. It had the perfect sear, and it did not disappoint. served on a bed of spinach. I only wish there was a rice pilaf or mashed potatoes of some sort that came with the dish! ..... although it was offered as a side, for more $$. it's okay. they were still delicious.

They have a wide selection of food including breakfast items but you should refrain and skip all of the breakfast items despite how good they look. You're paying $55 and the breakfast items are a trap even though they look very good. Salads as always are also a trap at buffets. With that said, they have a very nice seafood selection of steamed king crab legs, crab cakes, peeled and de-veined large shrimp cocktail, freshly shucked oysters, salmon, and seafood gumbo. They also have very nicely cooked beef tenderloin although the horseradish sauce didn't have much kick. The service was much better than what you'd find in a typical buffet. The overall quality of the food was up to the standards of the best Vegas buffets with the exception of the Sterling brunch although the selection was not as vast.

Once we moved to the table, we indulged ourselves into some great food.  We started off with: New Style Sashimi - yellow tail: this was different but very good. It had an interesting flavor due to the vinaigrette.  Jumbo claw - lots of meat and tasted so fresh King crab bites - fantastic and love how they cut it up for you so it's not a pain to eat them.  Jumbo lump crab cake - probably my least favorite thing out of everything we ordered, but it was good. Everything else was great so the bar was set high.  For my entree, I went surf and turf and it was very good. Lobster was cooked perfectly and the filet was cooked a nice medium rare. I would highly recommend.  We also had very good wine. The manager came over and let us sample some of his different types.  I will say, the service here is really good. Not only because the manager was giving us free wine, but we also were in a rush because we had tickets to the Blackhawks game and told our waiter.

I think that the all you can eat brunch is more worth it if you love seafood, but there are also plenty of non seafood options (mostly in the traditional breakfast section) for people that aren't seafood lovers.  Personally, my favorite section of the buffet was the cold station.  In the cold station, you can clearly taste how fresh the seafood is.  There are other all you can eat seafood programs out there, but very few can hold a candle to the quality of seafood and service found at Shaw's Crab House.",0.9251,0.888,0.094,0.018,0.6256666666666667

Atmosphere: You definitely want to be dressy if you want to be view as a normal person, but me and my friends on the other hand just wanted some great seafood after a night of drinking. The staff here are very delightful. They greet you with a smile and are very helpful. The tables are clean and set as well as the bathrooms.

Brunch Buffet: Again if you're a normal person you would try their traditional breakfast items which includes omelets with choice of toppings, hot waffles, bacon and many more, but me and my friends just filled up on their seafood. Seafood: Oysters- I believe there's 3-4 different kinds of oysters that they serve and they are always freshly shucked.  Shrimp- These bad boys are at a decent size. If you like shrimp cocktail you'll love these.  King Crab Legs- The misconception is they they serve whole king crab legs. They have king crab legs but chopped up into bit size pieces which still in they shell. Not sure if that matters to you but I wanted whole king crab legs. Plus it's all you can eat so it doesn't really matter.  Any other seafood dishes- They are very generous with their seafood so if you crab something with seafood in it there's a ton of seafood in every bit. I'm referring to the crab cakes and lobster soup. ;) Price $$$: It's $55 per person but the food, and I mean seafood, is fairly good here. Haha ;) Tip: Just remember that this is a traditional American brunch buffet with seafood. So if you're use to a lot of spices, like myself, then you may be slight disappointed.

The waiter seemed to be clueless about he menu, I asked him repeatedly about the portion sizes. One question to be exact.. Was the salmon dinner a large portion or small?  ""it's a nice size"" he responded. My wife had to ask him directly about the ounces of the salmon fillet. I sincerely believe this location is not worth the 150$ tab. If you are hungry and in need of a ""togo plate"" type of meal find another restaurant.

The broth and creaminess were so delicious, but the clams... they were the chewiest I've ever had in my life. It's like there was a membrane layer of chewy around them.  Second I had the basic shrimp cocktail, I was in the mood for it. The shrimp were gigantic. I really wish, though, they'd remove more of the hard shell on the shrimp tail end. If I only ate the shrimp up until the shell they leave on, there's a hunk of good meat underneath that shell! Why should that be wasted? So, I had to sit and maneuver with my knife, fork, teeth - whatever I could to get that extra shell off and to the yummy shrimp that was encased by it.  For my meal my choice was the horseradish encrusted whitefish. I've had whitefish up in Door County WI before at a fish boil as it was amazing. At Shaw's, it was underwhelming. You'd think with a horseradish crust there'd be some flavor. But, there wasn't and I don't think they  seasoned the fish at all before crusting it. Gotta season!!

2016-09-11,5.0,"We spent an early anniversary celebration at Shaw's this past Saturday night. Not surprisingly, it was a packed house and we were seated pretty close to other couples. We knew going into the dinner that things were pricey so that helped a tad with the shock of receiving our bill. Honestly, it was worth it. My husband had the infamous King Crab and I had the Surf and Surf. We shared a crab california sushi roll as an appetizer. It was difficult not to make a scene as we fought over the last piece of sushi. So good, so fresh tasting! Our entrees came out and my husband initially expressed concern that he wouldn't get full. Well, about one massive crab leg in, he quickly was eating his words, no pun intended. My surf and surf easily satisfied my appetite both in size and taste. There were several moments during dinner that we just looked at each other and said ""omg, so good"". Service here was spot on as well! Our server was friendly, professional, and beyond competent. The gentleman filling our waters and bussing tables was also excellent. Never an empty glass, never an awkward moment of trying to dismiss overbearing service. The staff pretty much floated whenever they walked by! To top our evening off, we were surprised with a complimentary piece of chocolate cake to celebrate our anniversary. Even though my husband was ""so full"", he had no problem eating his fair share of the yummy cake!!! Shaw's is the type of place that the ambiance alone makes you feel special.

Make a note on your reservation that you want dining room seats, away from kiddos. We're older, and are done with kids, so wanted a quiet dinner, but I digress! Our server was so pleasant and he and the other servers gave us just enough attention throughout the meal on a VERY busy on a Saturday night. We started with clam chowder, which was delicious, creamy and loaded with clams and potatoes, moved onto the wedge salad...not going to lie...I wasn't a fan. The dressing was too sweet and tangy for me, so won't order that again. However, the ingredients were very fresh so might order a different dressing on the side. We then ordered their famous king crab and I'm not lying when I tell you it was the BEST I've ever had, and I've had a lot. It was so fresh tasting, sweet, cooked perfectly and really delicious. I got almost three large legs for $65, which I know is a bit pricey, but trust me it was very good! We finished with their homemade ice cream and cobbler of the month (peach/blueberry combo). Never would have thought to put those two fruits together but it was dynamite! Double espresso - VERY hot and a decaf cappuccino, as I can't handle caffeine like my hubby can. We also shared martinis and wine with dinner, which were all well priced and very good. It was one of the best meals we had in Chicago and we'll definitely be back. Had been to Joe's Crab the night before and wasn't nearly as impressed with them as I was with Shaw's (and it was twice as much). Oh, and on the other side of the restaurant there is a much more casual oyster bar with live music. I think we may hit that up next time as everyone in there was having a blast!

I opted for one of the surf and turf combos, and was able to substitute a crab cake in place of the garlic shrimp (for an up charge).

2016-07-18,5.0,"I really didn't know what to expect when I stepped into the doors of Shaw's Crab House for their weekend brunch.  I had a gift certificate but it still wasn't enough to cover the entire bill but I knew that when I was going.  If you are thinking about going its $55 dollars plus tax for adults, $10 dollars plus tax for children 7-12...the great thing is children 6 and under are free.   I know you may thinking whoa that's a steep price because that's what I said when I first saw the price...there is no way I can ever afford to go after today. Welp, if you are like me and things are sometimes tight ""SAVE!"" it is well worth the experience. I don't think you need a reservation but I would if you are thinking of going the place filled up around 11am. When I walked through the doors I was greeted by two smiling faces who took my name.  We had to wait about 5 minutes because we were so eager to eat we got there before 10am, but it gave me a chance to see a sea of deserts and a mountain of bacon and sausage...just thinking about it now makes me want to dive right into the delicious looking food. When we were seated the staff was just wonderful especially our waitress EB...she never missed a beat and she made my sister and I feel like we were her only guest but she had several tables.  That's a sign of a person who is not only good at their job but wants to make your experience pleasant. They do have valet parking(not sure the price) but if you get there early enough you maybe able to park on the street.  We paid $8 dollars for 2 hours of street parking in front of the restaurant.  My sister and I may have been a tad bit overdressed but we were styling...lol but you don't have to for Brunch it was pretty casual! Now onto the food...Yum Everything was so fresh and I can't believe I didn't take one picture but I was to busy stuffing my face to even think about pulling out my phone. The food was so fresh and so good that I wanted to sit there another hour just so my food could digest and marinate that way I could get another plate...lol I wasn't a big fan of the key lime tart but silly me I was thinking of something like a key lime pie but it was very tart...lol I didn't really get to get to the desserts because I was too busy stuffing my face with Cucumber Salad, King crab, Oysters, Jumbo Shrimp, Beef Tenderloin, Lobster Bisque Soup, Sausage and the build your Omelet(which was to die for) My sister had the mini waffles, bacon(I wasn't a fan only because it was too sweet for me), fried shrimp and heck I can't remember it all because again I was stuffing my face...but none of it was disappointing. They also had a veggie table but I never found it because I stayed at the Oysters and Shrimp table...lol If you check out how much sea food is these days you will see how much of a deal you are getting because it is all you can eat.   You have a wonderful waitstaff that gets your drinks for you makes sure your water glass is filled at all times...seafood heaven!! They sale alcohol, but they are not included in the $55 price.  Next time I may check out their Bloody Mary($10) it looked so tasty! I also liked the family atmosphere it was very refreshing.

We also ordered asparagus and sautéed spinach. Everything was incredible. Afterwards Danielle gave us a complementary piece of Keylime pie. The second time we came in for lunch. This time we sat in the diner that looks a bit like a 50's diner. It's connected to the main restaurant but separate. I can't remember the server's name but I want to say Ruth or Ruby. She was an older lady with a funny personality. This time we shared a dozen oysters and crab cakes with salad. The crab cakes were the BEST I've ever had. Made with real fresh crab.

2016-06-24,2.0,"Back in November, a few friends of mine took me here to catch a glimpse of Chicago seafood. It took me this long to finally compartmentalize my experience, and wasn't until I saw the name pop up on a browser search when I keyed in, ""best seafood Chicago."" I remember it like it was last week. We had high hopes coming here, especially since this place had some notoriety being a part of the Lettuce Entertain You Enterprise.  Being a big proponent of seafood, I must say, this place left something more to be desired. Don't get me wrong, the atmosphere was delightful with soft lighting and plush leather rounded booths. The service was a bit slow, but that's understandable for a weekend night. Our group began with the Oyster Sampler as our appetizer. With several mantled oyster anatomy indexes on the walls as decor, I expected superior quality, instead what was delivered was lusterless. The oysters were meager, even during peak season, with shallow brine and dull coloring. A note to the produce buyer: perhaps it's time to switch vendors. Other less well-known joints that serve oysters on the half shell can dish out Bluepoints the size of my clenched fist. At Shaw's, the sad reality seems to be that oysters just isn't this restaurant's forte.  For the main course, I split an order of the Crab Cakes and King Crab Legs with one other person. The Crab Cakes were ok, flavor-wise nothing spectacular, however the steamed King Crab Legs (highly recommend) were quite fresh and succulent, paired wonderfully with the melted butter.  Overall, I expected a little more quality from a big name like Shaw's. Perhaps I'll return in the future to give it a second spin.

The lobster was decadent and perfectly cooked but the crab was quite dry and stringy. For a place with crab in their name, I'm surprised at this type of (lack of) quality. I mentioned that to my waittress, and said that perhaps the crab was too dry because it was heated/steamed, instead of the usual cool and chilled that I usually like it. The waittress clearly didn't want to deal with it, was rude about it. No offer to replace my meal with something else, or some crab that was chilled. The waitress said that they only ever serve it steamed and never serve it chilled ever (not true, as I later found out).

We were tourists and had 8:15 reservations, but happened to be in the area around 6, so popped in and were wonderfully offered a seat in the bar area.  We ordered a half-dozen oysters, one of each offered on the menu. My fiancé loves oysters and gets them every chance he can get; I don't like them, but tried one out of curiosity. And wow! The champagne salt they serve with the oysters is magnificent and they oysters were fresh and served on a really beautiful platter of ice. Starting off on a good foot.  We ordered a crab cake--can't go to a crab house without ordering a crab cake!--and it was divine. Served with a small salad and the most delicious mustard aioli... If I could've bottled that aioli and taken it home, I happily would have. The crab cake was mostly crab, and warm and wonderful.  For dinner, I ordered the lobster pasta. Quite honestly, it was nothing outstanding, but it was very good, and had more lobster than I knew what to do with. For lobster lovers, get this! I did not care for the arugala served with it, but it was easy enough to pick around.  My fiancé had scallops. I've never met a scallop I've liked, but these were, in a word, incredible. Amazing. Stupendous. Delicious. I could eat them all day. They were served with mushrooms and a butternut squash puree. It may have been one of the best bites of food I've ever had in my life.  We were sad to leave, and even more sad that Chicago is a three hour train ride away simply because this restaurant was so great.

With a careful selection process, I manage to leave here very satisfied each and every time. Nobody in the city does oysters better. Nothing like oysters and sparkling wine. Soups here are also very good. This place is normally listed on national rating charts for best seafood restaurants in the country, and I can understand why.   Their Saturday and Sunday brunch are one of the city's best kept secrets. The brunch offerings are outstandingly delicious (fillet roast, crab legs with rendered butter, extra large shrimp, oysters, eggs benedict, salmon pastrami, lobster bisque, Do Rite donuts, spicy tuna sushi, smoked salmon, ceviche, waffles, bacon, breakfast sausage, omelettes,...).  This place, without a doubt, has the best brunch buffet food in Chicago. If you order a bottle of sparkling wine and accompanying mimosa making juice concentrates, you are in for some outstanding mimosas. Also, there is a full bar ready to make you your favorite cocktail.

All the guests were happy and enjoying cocktails, the staff was smiling and I was instantly in a great mood. Our server walked us through the menu and had us laughing before we could order. We started with some champagne then they happen to have the exact bottle of wine we wanted that paired perfectly with the Seafood Salad (that I'll dream about until I get to enjoy it again). It was beautiful and loaded with fresh seafood. The variety of things In there drizzled with that dressing just made my tummy smile. When I go back I'll get a salad to go because it's THAT GOOD!

It's hard to be in a bad mood here, the fellow patrons were nice as well, I think this place has an atmosphere of great guest service which enables the patrons that are being served to respond in the same manner almost. Very kind staff. Food Quality - Fresh and excellent! Only problem I had was with the Caramelized bacon. It looks like it should be affection ally known as pork mountain because that's what it looks like. Unfortunately, the heat lamp fails to keep the bacon warm so by the time patrons get to it, it's lukewarm and HARD! Mgmt may want to consider another heating option for the bacon and even the sausages, similar to the eggs. Otherwise, all selections and food were freshly prepared, presented well and tasted wonderfully. I would like the oysters to be done Rockefeller style as well and it be included in the price of brunch. That would make it excellent.  I did not have the omelet or waffles, however, it didn't look like anything special or out of the ordinary, probably more for the kids that come along and don't get into the seafood and other premium options.  Lobster Bisque was excellent!  King Crab was excellent as well!  Overall : Great value for $55 per person!

The cold bar was stacked with all types of raw and cooked fish, oysters, smoked salmon, hand rolled maki, frosty fish ceviche and pretty much anything else the could dig out of the ocean.

2016-01-04,3.0,"This place is exactly what you would expect from a chain restaurant that specializes in seafood. Nothing was particularly exceptional, but nothing quite sunk to red lobster lows. The thing we enjoyed most was the lobster tacos, they were very meaty and light at the same time with a nice crunch. The lobster/crab combo entree was a bit overcooked, but not to the point of being thoroughly offensive.  The red snapper is the only thing I would pass on. We had the one that was flash fried...the quality of the fish was there, but it was not seasoned very well--I could have done it better myself at home. The chocolate cake was good: the mistake the restaurant makes here is serving it too cold. The leftovers, which warmed up on the way home were so much better than what we ate in house.

We both choose the surf n surf for the money it's a lot of food. Plus server recommended the potatoes augratin very good!

The crab was fresh and delicious! The shrimp was large, firm, and flavorful. I ate a small ocean. Lobster mac and cheese was divine. Totally worth it. We had to wait a bit for our table even though we had a reservation but it was totally packed so not the fault of the restaurant at all. Fast, friendly service. They took away our dirty plates and we marched right on up to the buffet to get new ones to load up. Again and again. Fast with the drink refills too! The sushi was surprisingly delicious as well. I liked the shrimp tempera roll.  I was wondering why on earth I was seeing people walking away from the desert table with literally an entire plate of desert. Until I walked up.

Start with a few nigiri pieces- I would recommend the salmon with fresno chile and then maybe move to a sushi roll or two. If you feel like going the more traditional route, the oysters are a can't miss. I get the half or full dozen chef sampler- you get a spread of whatever is freshest that day and get to try a variety of types. I love the horseradish cocktail sauce served as well, it tastes great with the bread (if there is any left after I am through with it!).  For mains, I would recommend the lobster tail and the scallops, but the crab cakes and jumbo shrimp cocktail is fabulous as well.  Most of all I love the atmosphere at Shaw's.

I grew up around the Chesapeake Bay and still live not far from it. I know crab cakes, and most ""Maryland"" recipes, Virginia's, too, for that matter, include the distinctive and wonderful seasoning known as Old Bay. I did not detect a trace of it in these crab cakes. They were bland. But there's more as far as less is concerned. They had a lot of bread or crumbs in the mix, such that  you couldn't tell crab meat from mush. This was flake meat. Maybe lump crab meat (the premium part) would have at least made that distinction. The best crab cakes have very little or no bread or crumbs and the ingredients other than seasoning, such as mayonnaise and maybe egg, are simply to hold it all together. This meal was disappointing.

2015-11-01,5.0,"I'm not really a brunch person, but I've been aspiring to brunch at Shaw's for years.  Today was the day, and the experience was everything I expected it to be. My focus was almost solely seafood.  No omelets, waffles, eggs, or even dessert, thank you.  I can get that anywhere.  I headed to the hot trays first for a dab of potato here and a strip of bacon there, but then I made a beeline for the seafood.  Oysters, hot and cold king crab legs, ceviche, maki, crab cakes, shrimp...yes, yes, yes!  The seafood ceviche was especially impressive -- really fresh and bright.  The only disappointing factor was how difficult it was to pry the crab meat from the shell - a factor not particular to Shaw's, I realize, but what reminded me why I never order crab legs unless they're pre-cracked -- way too much work with little return.  I even bent the cocktail fork.  But I suppose if they cracked open the legs for us, we'd eat them out of house and home. The service at Shaw's is stellar, something I find is almost universal to the upper-tier LEYE restaurants (see also:  Joe's).  Eric, Seth, et al., took excellent care of me, and no one batted an eye at the amount of time I spent at my table (at this price, I was intent on getting my money's worth). Brunch and a bloody set me back $72 all told (not including tip) (the bloody mary was $10 despite the $8 price tag on the online menu).  That's a hefty price tag, and it's nearly impossible to eat your bill's weight in seafood.  But you can try.  And I suggest you try, at least once in your life.",0.9333,0.828,0.106,0.066,0.5698717948717948

2015-10-21,3.0,"This is a review for a one-time recent visit (I would never have given it a less than 4 in 20 visits, before now).  I had a reservation, arrived early, and checked in, letting the hostess know where I would be. Went to the bar to wait and order something, because I was hungry.  It took a long time for anyone to notice me, even longer to order, and yet longer for the food to come out. Half a dozen oysters finally arrived, no plate, no utensils, no napkin, no bread, no explanation of which oysters were from where.  My friend arrived, had trouble finding me, because the hostess could't remember where I had gone. Then, into the main dining room. What happened to the great bread basket? The stunning cold oysters on the half shell or shrimp cocktail, or excellent crab cake appetizer for one?  The food had changed drastically, and not for the better.  We shared the hot appetizer combo for one-- there was not a thing about it to recommend. For entree's, I have usually had the salmon or scallops, but this time went with halibut, because it is really excellent this time of year.  The halibut was wood-grilled and smelled great, but was burned. The gnocchi were like overcooked glue balls. Still love the paintings, decor, and overall atmosphere. Service is old-school and still pretty good, a little dismissive and less attentive than before-- but that happens late in the evening. Get a grip, Shaw's, won't be recommending this once-lovely restaurant until you all come back to your former self-- I hope you do, because this has been a loooooong-time favorite. But, standards are higher now than they were 20 years ago, Shaw's is not a sushi restaurant, so ditch that, and get back to what made you great, without the inflated prices-- go back to the breadbasket, the great crab, lobster, shrimp and fish, simply prepared, some a few traditional accompaniments, and good wine and cocktails.  I hope to be back, but it won't be soon...",0.9965,0.784,0.185,0.031,0.48864468864468874

The seafood was so cold it was frozen and the portions were so tiny that I would have been able to look past if it was any good.

We were asked if this was our first time dining with them and why we have not been here before, they have been around for thirty years...

He was so pushy on us ordering an entree but when it came to ever having my drink refilled he was no where to be found. After we decided to order our entree (which I really wish we had not) we did not see our server again. Not once did he check in to see how we were enjoying our meal, if it was cooked well or to see that our drinks were once again empty.

I snapped a picture of it so I can have prove. I Called our waitress over, she got freaked out as well! Then she left to talk to I believe is the manager? He then came over to apologize, also to my surprised he only asked if we want to switch to another table. Is switching to another table going to make me ""un-seen"" the cockroach? And would it help me have my appetite back? After we agreed to move to another table because we weren't sure if anything else would crawl out from the side, that's it. They act like nothing had happened. I've been to Shaw's many times, never have I had such a disgusting experience.

2015-07-24,3.0,"[Out-of-Towner Review] A preface is needed for this review. When you are invited to an open bar, good free eats event prior to your reservation you STILL go!  So with that said, we pre-gamed before we gamed at Shaw's! Like a lot. So needless to say our walk from our party to dinner was well deserved, but didn't burn as many calories as all of us would have liked. We walked in about 20 minutes prior to our reservation, but it was too early for them. Not a huge deal to our party of 10, so we just hung around the front until we were called back. Since we'd all attended the party, no one was in the mood for appetizers. Normally we'd order more than necessary, but tonight everyone decided on a small cup of soup or a salad. I had neither, as I just wanted to an enjoy some seafood. Whatever their rolls are made of, they are heaven sent. They were warm, fluffy, and tasted like my carb dreams. There were a few types of rolls/carbs offered, but their regular roll was the only thing I tried. We ordered a delish white wine for the table, since that's what you do when you're at a seafood restaurant. At first I had every intention of just ordering seafood, but let's be real. I love the beef too. So, after too much deliberation I went with The Signature - Steamed Alaskan King Crab Legs and a 6oz Filet Mignon. This plate didn't stand a chance, even though I had plenty of food already in my belly! I mean, really, you know you're at a legit spot when you have to do absolutely ZERO work to get your crab out of the shell. The biggest, most delicious chunks of crab ready to be doused in butter and devoured. The filet was just a bonus. I killed all of my crab, then ate the filet as an afterthought. My entire meal, just that plate was delicious. I would have been satisfied with that. But since we were in a group setting I HAD TO take bites of the shared sides of potatoes au gratin and the lobster macaroni and cheese. Both were cheesy and fatty, just as you'd imagine. I think I was even able to have two mini helpings of both sides, since there were also other green sides the table ordered, which I avoided. Monkey see, monkey do. I ordered dessert, since everyone else was. But there wasn't too much on the dessert menu that spoke to me. So I went with the chocolate ice cream with a cookie and hot fudge on the side. The ice cream was good, but more melted than I'd prefer. The cookie was really good, I wished it came with one (or five) more... The service was less than par, which might be the only bad part of our evening there. It was crowded (I'm sure from plenty of people from the same tradeshow as us) and our server just was not as attentive as he should have been. We had a later reservation and were one of the last groups to leave. We were polite and didn't need too much - this is no exaggeration either. Our server walked away before he took everyone's dessert order. We filled our own wine glasses, since no one was there to do it. The busers did a great job clearing plates and whatnot, but they did not want to interact with us when we tried to ask them questions, since our server was MIA. Of course the pricing was on par with a nice seafood restaurant. Be prepared to enjoy seafood in Chicago at a heavy price. It's not the classiest joint in town, but their food makes up for areas they are lacking in. What seafood comes from Lake Michigan ;)",0.9973,0.808,0.147,0.044,0.5310413327991452

While a bit over priced, they were delicious.  Dinner was the spicy tuna roll to start. It was okay. I wouldn't highly recommend it because I've had better at much less expensive restaurants.  I followed that up with a iceberg wedge salad which was delicious but over dressed.  We had the crab legs for dinner. This is what they're known for and they were amazing. Warm and cut open for us, they melted in our mouthes and I couldn't recommend more.  No dessert but we did have intelligencia coffee. It was the perfect end.

2015-06-14,5.0,"We had a great experience here spearheaded by Patrick, our waiter. We had a 5:45 reservation and were seated at a really cute corner table in the back room. Our waiter's knowledge of the menu was excellent and, upon finding out I had recently moved to Chicago, recommended other restaurants in the area to try out. My guest had worked as a waitress for an extended period of time and was equally impressed by the level of service he offered us, despite being the restaurant filled to capacity soon into our meal. For an appetizer, we ordered three different rolls of sushi. Maine lobster, Acapulco, and Spicy Shrimp, Salmon & Lemon. In total it was $41. Here's where I have a bone to pick with negative reviewers- this was enough food to be dinner for two people. The quality was fantastic. The amount of tuna in the ($10) Acapulco roll was generous, the lobster roll was refreshing and delicious, and the Shrimp, salmon and lemon roll was easily the best combo roll with salmon that either of us had ever had. After that, I ordered stone crab claws while the person I was dining with ordered the crab cake. I must admit that it was my first time eating stone crab. Were the claws delicious? Yes. Will I pay that much money to eat them again? no. I wouldn't say that it makes the menu item overpriced, it makes it expensive. Mashed potatoes were shared between us and were perfect. The entire night, we watched plates piled with food zooming past us to happy customers throughout the section we were seated in. As we left and walked through the main dining room, I remarked how quiet it was, and my girlfriend agreed. Maybe if you are from a coastal area or come at prime time with a party of 6 thinking you'll be seated immediately, this is indeed a three or four star restaurant, but, for me, it exceeded my expectations and is deserving of 5 stars. The only reason I won't be returning in a heartbeat is because I'm new to Chicago and have more exploring to do. That being said, if some of the negative reviewers could list restaurants in Chicago that make Shaw's ""overpriced"" or ""a bad value"", I would like to check them out.

The menu begins with an interesting selection of (yes, traditional) cocktails, and some nicely thought out wine by the glass selections. The tuna tartare appetizer nicely combined citrus and avocado flavors, and was accompanied by ample dipping chips. Shrimp cocktail was a classic preparation, with good sized shrimp and just the right amount of horseradish. I particularly enjoyed the Caesar salad, which had a nicely balanced dressing, and thin wafer-like croutons with a lot of flavor. The Copper River salmon was good, not remarkable, but I really enjoyed the accompanying grilled asparagus. A side of au gratin potatoes was more like a dish of cheese and butter with a trace of potatoes under there, but it was as delicious as it sounds.

2015-05-25,2.0,"Over 3 decades ago I had my first lobster at Shaw's and since then we have celebrated many occasions there, birthdays, new years eve, and my first wedding proposal (I said no). We have not been for a couple of years and so chose it for my mom's birthday dinner last night. I was, for the first time, very disappointed. We had a reservation and, after watching 3 managers (?) quibble in a confused manner at the host area for several minutes, we were led in to a table right next to the service area. I indicated my disappointment and she seated us instead at a table right in the middle of the dining room. It felt like we were in a rugby scrum. I had to wiggle into my chair and we passed our glasses to the only space the busboys could reach to have them filled. I could easily have rifled through my neighbor's purse without her ever knowing and everyone's conversation was heard by all. There were several other, better, empty tables but once I got in my chair, I did not know if I could get out of it.  Somehow, given the crush, our server made it to us. She did a very solid job and checked in with us regularly -- no complaints there.  Cocktails came, lovely. Wine followed, Kim Crawford -- also lovely.  No specials on the menu for this holiday weekend, disappointing.  We ordered apps: The calamari was good, big pieces, not much cocktail sauce when sharing with four people.  The maki combination plate was outstanding. A salad and a cup of bisque came next and was shared around. The bisque was good but not the best I have had. The salad was delicious but not as advertised. the menu says""Shaved Vegetable Salad, spring carrots, radish, beets, lemon dressing"" which leads one to presume that is what it is. Nope, add arugula and herbs and that is more like it. It is delicious but the menu is misleading. Entrees: I tried them all.  Grouper ($36), my dad and I both ordered it, meh. We agreed it was a piece of slightly over-grilled, thoroughly unseasoned grouper and a bed of caponata and pea shoots. Not bad all together but the fish alone was completely underwhelming. Parmesan crusted haddock ($26). This was the best fish at the table but it, and its garnish, were only warm, not hot, when they hit the table. Also, some of the oil they sauteed it in could have been used on the grouper.  Asian style yellowfin tuna ($36). This was a delicious preparation, unfortunately the tuna was well-done. My husband ordered it medium, a sin, but he is not a fan of cold bits, and they butterflied the filet, creating 2 woody, dry, pieces of tuna that were quite overcooked even by his notoriously not-picky standards. Had I realized early on how bad it was I would have pushed him to send it back. No dessert. Coffee was tasty.  All told, we spent almost $400 for some nice cocktails, a good bottle of wine, a delicious (though ill represented) salad and some terrific maki. If this was 1990 the entrees we had would have been new and interesting in their preparation, instead it was fine. There is too much competition in Chicago to get me back there to pay real money for ""fine""; I will to console myself with memories of this once great restaurant and hope that out-of-towners continue to support it while we spend our special occasions someplace that tries harder.",0.9939,0.741,0.162,0.098,0.5077372627372628

Everything was just exceptional. We all loved the cute old school 60's feel it had and our server was incredible. One of my friends has a shellfish allergy and they were very accommodating.  All of our drinks came out just the way we liked. I ordered the oyster sampler ( got 50% off from checking in on Yelp!) and it was heaven for my taste buds. I wanted lobster tails and only saw the 2 listed on the menu but I asked the server and he did say that 1 was available and that's what I went with, which was absolute perfection. There were NO complaints from our party and only rave reviews-- some of the other orders were crab legs, clam chowder, whole lobster, scallops and sushi.  Shaw's is definitely now on my list of Chicago go-tos. I visit at least once a year and every time I will be sure to add this to my must eat places.

Yes it's expensive, but I believe you're getting what you pay for in food quality, service, ambience, and entertainment if you're in the Oyster Bar.

Worst offense was finding a small amount of shell in my crab cake. Not a big deal if it's a great tasting crab cake. The seafood gumbo was a tad salty, but it was very flavorful and balanced out with rice. What others ordered and loved... the lobster bisque, cold appetizer platter, calamari, sushi & sashimi, halibut, lobster mac, lobster pasta, and crème brûlée. In addition, the table bread was just outstanding. By 9:00 PM, we disbanded, but some of us moved over to the Oyster Bar where there was live jazz music.

My BF ordered the Manhattan. Both were great and well made! Food: My BF loves oysters, so he enjoyed a half dozen sampler platter while I ordered a cup of the lobster bisque. The bisque wasn't as thick and creamy as I prefer, but there was a good amount of lobster however. My BF seemed to really enjoy the oysters and raved about the extra sauce they provided along with the usual fixings.

2015-03-15,3.0,"I came in here about a month ago. Like everyone else, I wanted to see if Shaw's Crab House lived up to the rants and rave.  The food at best was decent, nothing spectacular or anything different that can't be found at another top seafood restaurant. I will admit that the King crab was delicious but nothing that outstanding- I had better. Where quality is concerned the king crab and oysters are worth the bang for the buck. My waitress was very cordial and nice. She made up for the terrible experience that the concierge messed up on. Mind you, I was here for a celebration and was not happy before being seated. I almost walked out and wanted to try elsewhere.  My complaint: I did not enjoy the wait of being seated. My friend and I got there 20 minutes early before reservation time. We knew it was going to be crowded on a Friday night. For the most part we were patient and calm, being understanding of the situation. We come in, checked in and waited. The wait area wasn't crowded but not empty either. We waited for about 30 minutes past the reservation time. My friend went up twice to the concierge twice to inquire about our table and she (concierge) gave a confused face. She mentioned, ""it will be ready in a minute"" twice this was her response. While, the other short blonde hair concierge women kept rolling her eyes and looking at my friend as if she was bother. We were under the impression that if you told us that you would notify us near the reservation time and didn't have a lot of other parties skip ahead of me, circumstances would have been different. A lot of other parties went ahead of us with later reservations and bigger parties, or the same size. I am a conversationalist and that is how I knew my right to be frustrated was justified.  On my way out, my party decided to grab a mint candy that was on the concierge table, just like anyone else would. The same short blonde hair concierge gave the same dissatisfied look at me this time.

We appreciated that a lot. Great lighting in the room: Very comfortable and geniously they position a light right in the middle of your table so you can still see the menu comfortably.

My favorite entree is the jumbo lump crabcake with a side of broccoli and Brie sauce. Alternatively, the lobster bisque is second to none with actual pieces of lobster in it. The portions seem small but are very rich and usually I can't finish my plate! Finally I love the lemon sorbet which comes with a sugar cookie for dessert.

Unfortunately I was mistaken. We had 9pm reservations and we're not sat until 9:45. When I asked the hostess about an estimate on when we could sit down, she said ""if you're having a drink, I would suggest you get another."" I thought that was exceptionally rude. When we finally sat at our table, it took the waiter 10-15 minutes to take our order, so we quickly asked for shrimp cocktail and 2 large stone crab claws. The shrimp were average at best and when the food runner dropped off the stone crab he said they were 2 mediums...then tried to backtrack and say they were large. They were not, and were ridiculously overpriced. After another 10 minutes, we put in our entree order after asking 3 times for bread. My girlfriends steak was so ridiculously overlooked that she was hesitant to even try it. Totally black on the outside and grey throughout. My lobster tail was cold, rubbery, and tasteless. I would never complain about food unless it was extreme, especially on Valentine's Day, but this was too much and was way too expensive. They ended up comping the steak, a glass of wine and key lime pie (tastes like it was from jewel), but this may be the last time I ever try shaws again.

My wife and I come to Shaw's with our family, and they love it too. The service is extremely good, the restaurant is very clean and the menu is full of delicacies. I almost always have a lobster, since they are so good, but their fish is excellent too, and everything on their menu is extremely tasty. They have an extensive assortment of oysters, so if you like oysters, you've come to the right place. They have quite a few beers too, so its easy to find one that fits your taste. There are two different rooms here, with a bar in the entrance area if you have to wait for a table. There is a beautiful main dining room, and a more casual area with a big bar in it. We typically get a table, but have hugged the bar while waiting for our table to be ready. The food is top notch, and the lobsters go on sale during their annual 'Lobster Boil.' It's a very comfortable place, whether you're seated in the main dining room, or the casual room. The lobster tank is placed between the two rooms, so you can get a glimpse of what's on the menu. I have never been disappointed by Shaw's, nor has my wife, or our extended family. For fresh seafood, it really doesn't get much better. It's reliable quality with tremendous service and cleanliness. You can always expect a satisfying meal here. The prices are not inexpensive, but they are reasonable for the quality. If you want a table in the dining room, it's best to make a reservation since it is popular, and does get quite busy. The crowd is lively in the casual room, but not too loud, and the main dining room is typically busy, but quiet.

Shaw's brunch is everything.  It is a giant, hours-long seafood love fest.  If you are a seafood lover (and I assume if you're looking at reviews for a place with crab house in the name, you probably are) this is where you should spend your Sundays.  Of course, its $55 a person, so probably not every Sunday.  But its so worth it.  Ignore the brunch entrees, the meats, the desserts that make every other buffet brunch good.  Go straight to the king crab legs, fresh oysters, ceviches, smoked salmon, various sliced raw fish, fresh shrimp.  Don't forget some lobster bisque.  Eat seafood until you can't move.  Eat seafood until you know that you, single-handedly, have destroyed part of the ocean ecosystem.  Pat yourself on the back for this accomplishment.   The bloody mary's are good too.",0.9273,0.787,0.156,0.057,0.502810650887574

The server was a young man who said he was originally from Michigan, Unfortunately I can't remember his name. He had incredible customer service & a very laid back and casual yet very mannered demeanor-- One of the best waiters I have ever encountered. He even provided us with a complimentary slice of chocolate cake and two shots of this eucalyptus-tasting Italian liquor. Wow-- totally went over the top to make our experience unforgettable.

Dude, when I only have an hour for lunch, don't take your sweet ass time just because you say it's crazy busy when it's not really bustling at all. Just give me the service I expect from a seafood restaurant that's charging me $26 for a fish with no sides.  I walked in and was pleased with the atmosphere, because it was nice and reminded me a bit of what I felt when I first walked into Joe's, and I had great service there. Took my friend here for her birthday and called ahead and said that it was her birthday and that I wanted to pre-order a dessert for her, so I was hoping we'd have a good dining experience.  It took our waiter 15 minutes to take our order after we got seated, and we went straight to ordering the appetizer and entrees together since it had already taken so long to get to that point. After that, the blue crab fingers took forever to get to us, and it was another 20 or so minutes until we got our entrees- lobster roll and the crab stuffed walleye. I was debating between the salmon, which came with potatoes, and the walleye--- which unfortunately I failed to realize comes with nothing but sauce. You know, I would have liked it if the waiter was thoughtful enough to be like, ""hey, miss, did you want to order any sides since that fish comes with nothing?"" But no... I didn't realize it until my food came, and so I asked to see the menu to order some sides. Well there were no sides LISTED since practically everything else had sides.... like NORMAL ENTREES should. He listed some off, and I picked the au gratin potatoes, and he scurries off. Comes back and tells me that it's not available. At this point, I'm starving and ate half my fish already, so no point in waiting another 20 minutes for him to bring back cauliflower or whatever else they have. My friend's lobster roll was filled with huge chunks of lobster, which I loved--- crunchy bun too, which was good. My fish was just okay--- I really wished I had potatoes or broccoli or something to go with it-- it just felt like something was missing. At this point, we'd been there for over an hour, and my plate is empty, and my friend is picking at her french fries (which were delicious by the way). But the waiter is no where to be seen, no offering of a dessert menu or anything. I went and told the waitress that I'd like dessert menus or some kind of service since I hadn't seen the guy in so long. She assures me she'll get him.... well he comes and drops off a plate of desserts with candles, which is really sweet, but I'm surprised he didn't ask if we wanted to see anything else. What if my friend was selfish and didn't want to share her dessert plate??? Well, the creme brulee and the chocolate cake were good. But it didn't wash away the bad taste that was in my mouth from having to go up and get the server to give him my card to pay since he disappeared after giving us the dessert. He apologized and said they were short one server and it was busy, but I don't want to hear any excuses. The fact that I had to get up twice to get some service is unacceptable. Also, pretty sure they had a manager or someone around, why didn't he come around to rectify the situation? Well, the server comped our appetizer--- but it was already half off since we checked in on Yelp. Thanks for comping us $6.50 dude! Definitely a pass.

We usually start with a classic gin martini, although on occasion I'll have a Manhattan.  Either way, the cocktails are perfectly crafted.  If we have to wait a few minutes for our table, we order a cocktail in the bar and they will bring it to the table for us if we haven't finished it.   The oysters are our favorite starter.  Shaw's always has fresh oysters, flown in from either coast and the available varieties change daily because of this.   Their wait staff is able to describe the varieties to you so that you can choose what you prefer: large or small, briny or sweet.  We have always taken their recommendations and never regretted it.  Other favorite starters are the crab cakes, shrimp cocktail, and crab claws.  They also have a really excellent clam chowder.  Shaw's fish menu also changes frequently, to take advantage of the freshest seafood available.  They will cook it as simply as you want (there's a ""simply grilled seafood"" section of the menu) but they have added more seasoned dishes, such as mustard crusts.  We've had lobster tail, lobster stuffed with crab, grilled scallops, swordfish, halibut, salmon, whitefish, and filet.  Everything we've had has been prepared expertly and to our specifications.  The sushi I've had there is the best sushi I've ever had.

I like the oysters, without reservation, and with at least an implied exclamation mark. I like the wine, most of the time. I like the beer.

The waitress said that there were no substitutions and I would have to order the lite fare. I said that I would like to at least have the peppercorn crust and that was not a possibility as well.  I visit fine dining restaurants often and I was so disappointed that I could not get what I wanted and a small request like a potato was not possible. We also never got the oysters. We noticed that everyone around us was getting their raw fish platters. The waitress was not to be found. Before you know it we got our meals and then she appeared and asked if we still wanted our oysters.

I got an Alaskan halibut. The fish itself was extremely fresh.

Boyfriend got peppercorn-crusted tuna, and wow, that's amazing. Get that. It's really good. He also had a gin martini he liked.

Although it was loud inside, I didn't mind it so much. Most of the noise came from a live jazz band that played every 20 minutes or so, and they were pretty good (they actually sang well and knew how to play their instruments, so that was a plus).  For an appetizer, we shared the Maryland-style crab cake, which came with a mustard sauce and was very good. We also ordered drinks; I had the Alamos Malbec red wine (a slightly sweet wine with a rich aftertaste), and my boyfriend had a Luda Nuda Pinot Grigio, which he enjoyed. For my main course, I played it safe because I was still feeling full from the pizza I had for lunch, and I had the sashimi combo (three pieces each of salmon, tuna, and yellowtail). The sushi was fresh and delicious, although I was mildly concerned that the tuna was very dark. My boyfriend had a bowl of clam chowder and a cup of jambalaya soup, both of which he liked. I'm not a fan of creamy chowder, so I passed on that, but the jambalaya had an interesting flavor: it was a combination of sweet and spicy with a slight tomato taste. If I found myself here again, I would be willing to order this for myself. We had just enough room for a dessert sampler: four miniature versions of their regular fare (key lime pie, chocolate cherry cake, creme brulee, and raspberry pie).

Both appetizers were great.  Then moved to our 5:30 reservation in the main dinning room.  Had to try the Alaskan King Crab Bites appetizer and shared an order of Surf & Surf (lobster tail & crab legs) and the Maine Lobster Pasta.  All very fresh and very tasty.  The lobster pasta was great and served as good side to the lobster tail and crab legs.  A shared Peach and Blueberry Cobbler ala mode and a cup of coffee each capped things off perfectly.  Fun vibe in the Oyster Bar and more upscale in the dining room - but casual dress is  just fine in both.",0.9611,0.836,0.164,0.0,0.4708333333333333

Husband ordered the crusted Haddock over spinach. I tasted it and was very delicious. 3 people at the next table all ordered the Haddock, it must be a popular dish. I ordered the Crab Stuffed Maine Lobster. The lobster was very sweet and the crab stuffing was okay. Service was excellent. Ordered a couple of lemon drop martini's, made correctly with fresh lemons.

Had some excellent rolls before ordering a 1 lb. Maine lobster stuffed with blue crab. I usually don't order lobster unless I'm in the Northeast (think Boston) because it's clearly best in that region. However, this is Chicago, a global culinary destination, and Shaw's seems to have the best reputation and reviews of any seafood joint in the city. The lobster was very good - the best I've had outside the East Coast. But throw in the blue crab on top, with a squeeze of lemon and drawn butter, and this meal was positively delicious. The price of the entree ($35) was also very reasonable for a high-end Chicago restaurant. I hear the oysters are excellent, although I didn't try them.

2014-07-23,4.0,"If it were last year I would have given this place a five star rating. Although, what place am I talking about? Shaw's has two restaurants side by side at the same location"" Shaw's Crab House, and Shaw's Blue Crab Lounge. I have been to the lounge thirty times, but only to the more elegant Shaw's Crab House, twice. First off, the interior of the building is one of Richard Melman's best, being discrete,  and sea shore elegant in the main restaurant, And making the Lounge feel like a mid scale, Fishermany rehab of an old East Coast crab shack.. it's all fun and not over the top. There are many great things about the lounge and a few negative ones. The good things are that is is fun. with a high energy blast as soon as you walk though the door. And the place smells good too.  It is always crowded and the hostess will seat you. Your party can sit down at either the bar (like a horse shoe in the middle of the room), or in an uncomfortable wooden booth or, at one of the few tables, or at a one of a cluster of small, high bar tables with stools that make you feel like a midget.  On weekends they sometimes offer way to loud, live music (mostly )azz).. Great things: the lounge has a really great Oyster selection. Back in the 1980s this oyster selection was unique to the Midwest. Up untio then we only got Blue Points from New England; but even they were a few days old. But in the 1980s Richard Melman set up an amazing oyster distribution system that got oysters from other places in the world to Chicago in one day, And the entire county followed suit. Now you can get great fresh oysters everywhere in the country.  So what did Melman do? He set up an oyster happy hour, when you could buy any oyster for a dollar. And that still holds pretty true today. If you want go to happy hour here you can get a discounted Anchor Steam pint and two dozen excellent oyster for under $30.00. Or you can get half a dozen oysters alone for around 8 bucks total. I love this place. Above and beyond the happy hour you can get the oysters, from anywhere in the World, form between $2 and $3. You can also get other happy hour items, and of course, anything on either the Lounge menu or the Main Restaurant menu. This some how seems to defeat the purpose of the vision. Why would one go to a seaside crab shake for a bowl of $40 Bouillabaisse or a similarly priced exotic fish. The shack is for a raw bar and some chowders or fried shrimp. And the main dining room is for high end eating and celebrations. And I don't think that Melman's vision was to clutter Shaw's  further with a convoluted interfaces and too many Disney style additions. Yet still, the Blue Crab Lunge convoluted things further with the newer addition of a Sushi Bar. This is do close to a five, for fun. So close.",0.9989,0.762,0.207,0.031,0.4998788329223112

And I am so glad I did. We planned ahead and secured 5:45 reservations. What a difference it was from our previous 8 o'clock reservations. The restaurant was not busy at all. We got sat immediately. Our server was the sweetest man there. An older Hispanic gentleman who didn't cut corners with his service. Which I believe our last server did when she saw my bf and I ; young Mexican couple who superficially doesn't ""fit"" in. But anywho we started off with the house special lobster bisque and the appetizer combination which included calamari, mini crab cakes, and French fried shrimp. Everything came out in a timely matter and very hot. Everything was delicious! I was in shock, even the lobster bisque was delicious. The mini crab cakes where so full of fresh crab meat and full of flavor I almost opted for a mini crab cake platter!!  For dinner, I ordered the red king crab legs and the 6oz filet mignon. My boyfriend order the lobster tail and 6oz filet mignon. Let me just say everything was absolutely amazing. My crab legs were actually meaty and hot! The filet was cooked perfectly. A beautiful chard outside and perfect pink inside. I cannot say anything bad about my experience. I think my last experience had many factors that contributed to the less than perfect experience. And in my gut I believe it was due to our waitress. Because yesterday's time there was only made possible by our server, food runner, and busser. Well let's not forget the delicious food!  We didn't order any dessert but the server overheard my bf say it was my bday and without hesitation he brought to the table a slice of chocolate cake with a candle. :) what a perfect end to a beautiful time out. Thank you. Oh the cake was absolutely deliciously! I would buy it on our next visit",0.9947,0.817,0.174,0.009,0.5516345427059713

The oyster bar had live music while we were there, which precluded in-depth conversation about work - probably a good thing.  The two women at the table next to us evidently thought turning their vocal volume up to 11 was therefore appropriate, so we were also prevented from having any sort of conversation, period.  The bread brought to our table was dry and unremarkable.  We had the calamari appetizer and it was tasty, but wayyyy too salty.  The fish dinner I had was a bit bland but perfectly adequate, and we skipped dessert. Service was VERY slow, and flat-out terrible at maintaining drink levels - alcoholic or otherwise.  We didn't see our server unless they were appearing with our food, and whatever we asked for when we did see them was generally forgotten multiple times.  What a pain.

At the time, my gf and I decided to go all out and take brunching to the next level so we decided on Shaw's. The all you can eat crab legs and oysters were a huge hit. Cracking the hard shells and having juice fly everywhere made for a messy, but fun meal. I loved the cheesy, breaded Lobster Mac & Cheese and helped myself to mountains of crispy fried shrimp. Sadly I wasn't a huge fan of the candied bacon that they served- I felt that it definitely could've done without the sugar. However, that wasn't a big deal because there are so many food options here. If you somehow have the stomach to attack dessert afterwards, there's plenty to feast on. There were mini tarts of all kind including pecan, key lime, and raspberry; they served creme brulee which was rich and satisfying; and do-rite donut bites. If you decide to bring kids here, there's also colorful cotton candy and cracker jack. Shaw's is the definition of a brunch splurge but should be tried if all you can eat seafood sounds like your thing.

It's Good Friday today, so that means no meat! I yelped a great seafood place and found Shaws, thanks to yelp. I'm so glad I made a reservation!! It was ABSOLUTELY delicious.  First of all, do yourself a favor and make reservations. We got there at 5:45 pm for ours and we still had to wait because it was so packed. We waited about 10 mins. The bar was absolutely packed and the dining room was full as well. Reservations are a must here unless you're trying to hit up the oyster bar or the regular bar.  The food was absolutely great. They provide you with cheese bread and a flat/cracker type bread. The cheese bread was SOOO GOOD. Our server said that they make it in house. I can definitely tell because it was so nice and fluffy.  For our appetizer, we split the cold appetizer combo. It came with 2 oysters, 1 lobster tail, 2 shrimp, and 2 crab pieces. Everything was super fresh!  Also, there is a yelp check in special! Half off an appetizer with purchase of an entree!  For the entree, we decided to splurge and get the Alaskan king crab legs! We also got the Shaws seafood platter and a side of broccoli. We both ended up splitting everything. It was so good! I know the crab legs are expensive, but they were really good and I don't regret it at all. Worth the price!  We had room for dessert so we ordered the creme brûlée and some green passion tea. Our server, Ruth, knew it was our first time and gave us a FREE key lime pie!!! I was so shocked and so happy. Especially since we already used a yelp coupon already lol. The creme brûlée and the key lime pie were so good. I highly recommend each.  The service! IMPECCABLE. Our waters were never empty, always filled to the brim. Our plates were clear almost the minute we were done. They cleaned any crumbs after the plates were gone. They always checked in on us.

2014-03-05,4.0,"We were planning our Valentines weekend getaway a month in advance and it was still impossible to get reservations on Valentines Day anywhere! We ended up making a dinner reservation here at 5:45pm LOL. We were seated immediately. The table is extremely long, so it wasn't exactly an intimate, romantic date. Oh well. We looked over the menu and were discussing our options. The menu is huge! I don't know if it's bc it was Valentine's Day so they want to get everyone in and out, but our waiter was kind of rushing us to put in our drink orders. The drink menu is pretty extensive as well... give us some time! We both ordered a cocktail and proceeded to look at the menu. We took a glance at the couple at the table next to us and they were sipping on a bottle of wine. We were wondering if it was free corkage fee here but we realized the waiter just never gave us the wine menu x_x guess we don't look old and sophisticated enough. Anyways, they had a price fixed menu for Valentine's Day for $80 each that came with a seafood platter, appetizer, entree, and dessert, but the price rises to $100 each if even one of you wants to order the Alaskan crab legs. We decided to just order a la carte. My bf got the lobster bisque and steak and I ordered the Alaskan king crab legs with a side of mashed potatoes. The lobster bisque came out first and it was REALLY GOOD.. like FREAKING GOOD! Our entrees came out next. My crab legs didn't look like much food since it was just 1 huge leg and 2 smaller legs but I def underestimated the amount of food! I struggled to finish. It was EXCELLENT though! The waiter brings you butter that gets heated over a flame at the table. The steak was mediocre. I'm glad I ordered the Alaskan king crab legs even though it was pretty expensive.

Generous servings of well prepared food. Superb wine and beers to go with it. Blue crab spring rolls were delicious and inventive. Be warned, this is rich food. No holding back on the butter and salt, but not too much to ruin the food. Desserts (creme brûlée, chocolate cake) weren't the best part of the meal, but they held their own. I will rant about the price of crab. I suppose it's market price, but living on the coast spoiled me. I would have loved to have ordered some crab, but the price is prohibitive. Real shame.

It was enough food but I think they need to adjust the price a bit. My husband got the Shaw's seafood platter, it was equally small for the price ($33).  The martinis we ordered?  Not even served in martini glasses, they were the smallest drinks I've ever had.  The au gratin potatoes were heavily salted.  And while I can't really complain about free dessert for my birthday, it was a heavy fudgy cake that was alright but I would have never ordered.

Luckily, I wasn't hungry since I was on California time, so 9:15 was fine. So, make a reservation early. I checked in on Yelp and got free calamari rings. Now, the main problem people have with calamari is it tends to be rubbery. NOT HERE. This calamari was so good-- light and delicate. We also had the oyster platter-- best oysters I've ever had. Then I had some local white fish and my husband had lobster pasta. Everything was really good. The dining room was getting quieter, because it was close to closing. Anyway, I'm from San Diego, and I'd say Shaw's is better than any seafood experience I've had here (and yes, I did not just go to Red Lobster, ha ha).  The only somewhat negative is that the older couple next to us were having a rotten time-- the tables are close together, and you share a bench with the person next to you.

I'll wait for my trip to Portland to fully indulge in sweeter, fresher oysters. The ones here on this particular morning tasted borderline bad, they were walking a very fine line. The crab and shrimp were really good especially the fried shrimp. They were big not puny. I was disappointed with the Do-Rite donuts though. I thought there would be more of a selection but it's just boring cake donut holes. They have an omelette station I didn't partake in.. maybe next time.

Even better for me (with celiac disease): they actually have gluten-free items marked on the menu, AND have trained the waiters, so that I don't have to go into long elaborate explanations and questionings just to find out if there is anything I can eat -- and then still feel stressed and uncertain and a bit like an annoying second-class citizen.  The waiter was even kind enough to note that the soy sauce he brought for my sashimi was gluten-free. In a perfect rating system, I would give this place a 4.6.  It isn't perfect -- the silly cocktails in the menu are of course overpriced and not really worth it, and the food certainly is not innovative -- but in general it is of excellent quality.   But if forced to choose between 4 & 5 stars, I will give it 5.",0.9844,0.716,0.207,0.077,0.6767509276437849

The tables in the middle of the room were crammed in so closely that I hit the chair of the diner behind me when I had to get up from the table.

2013-04-13,5.0,"I loved, yes loved, Shaw's Crab House.  I wish they had something equivalent close to where I live.  As part of a business conference I had the duty to organize a dinner for 10 (including 6 of our key independent account producers) and after some coaching from our local associate chose Shaw's.  Just to set the bar, let me say that the people in our group regularly eat out in the course of their business at some of the best restaurants in LA, SF, Seattle etc etc.  If things are not going right at dinner they can be vocal. The setting is old time Chicago and the menu reflects the old school seafood approach, but also includes a wealth of sushi choices. The menu included some imaginative cocktails and a solid wine list.  We started off by ordering two of the cold seafood towers for the table.  This ample presentation included oysters, king crab, lobster and shrimp.  All very fresh and flavorful. After that a number of people had a wedge salad and all comments were very positive. I chose the stone crab claws for my second course and was delighted by size and taste.  As good as the ones I have had in Florida. Deciding on a main course proved to be a difficult choice for me.  Frankly, I wanted to eat the whole menu or at least taste it.  The menu is printed each day as nature provides the freshest fish and seafood.  After much back and forth, I went the the swordfish.  I have not had GOOD swordfish in awhile and wanted to see if Shaw's could deliver.  They fully delivered.  The fish was terrific.  Fish and seasoning worked perfectly together.  Serving size about 12 oz.  Others at the table ordered king crab, surf and surf, sea bass, stone crab claws and halibut.  No one was less than completely pleased with their choice.  We also order a number of sides to share such as potatoes a gratin, broccoli, mac & cheese, mashed potatoes and other veggies. All servings were more than ample to share and well received.  I (not generally a potato guy) was taken with the a gratin potatoes.  Just perfectly prepared with a crusty top.   My dessert was homemade peppermint ice cream (I asked for no fudge on mine.) While I only had room for about 3/4 spoon fulls it set off the dinner exceptionally and reminded me of the small town ice cream I used to encounter in rural PA.

My husband, who doesn't understand oysters at all, asked me at Shaws what sets apart a restaurant with great oysters.  I thought about it and replied that there are three things (my personal criteria):  (1) freshness, (2) shucking quality, and (3) selection Shaw's does a good job on all 3 fronts and we ate a LOT of oysters during our visit (we had them for lunch and basically didn't really eat anything else).  The selection is pretty wide, with some good quality types, although not a ton of really special varieties.  I was really impressed with the shucking quality, considering I'm back in the Midwest.  I had a ton of juice left and zero shell pieces -- that's right, only amateurs turn their noses up at slurping oysters.  And the oysters were very fresh.  The mignonette/sauce weren't anything crazy or creative, but frankly, I want to taste the oyster anyway. I've had better oysters on the east coast, but this is Chicago, and frankly, I was a little surprised that the oysters were this good!",0.9936,0.776,0.199,0.025,0.6164487811039536

Menu was simple, which set me up to expect that the things offered would be amazing. I kept it simple with Surf & Surf (lobster and crab legs). My husband selected Surf & Turf (crab legs and filet topped with horseradish). Simple, classic, and extravagant - perfect silver anniversary selections. Also decided to share half a dozen oysters, lettuce wedge salad, and creamed spinach. Perfection was anticipated. Oopsie... Overcooked crab & lobster for me and a flavorless filet with the horseradish topping and same unimpressive crab legs for my husband. Oysters were tiny - sampler 1/2 dozen that may have comprised a sum total of a tablespoon of seafood for $15. The creamed spinach was too bland to remedy with table seasonings. The complementary dessert sampler earned one star, the lettuce wedge salad earned the other. Better quality can be found elsewhere - throwing around money the way we do when we celebrate, I assure you Shaw's Crab House downtown will never see us darken the doorway again.

I will admit we had a very weird experience which we were not expecting since we like the Shaw's in Schaumburg, IL so much. We were about fifteen minutes late for our reservation due to the fact that we could not get a cab. The combination of pouring rain, people getting out of work, and the start of the Big Ten tournament made it so every cab was taken. When we finally get a cab and get to the restaurant, they say it is no problem at all and seat us. This is where it gets weird. The maitre d' walks us past empty table after empty table in the main dining room. We walk into the other dining room where there is not a soul (no patrons, no waiters, no busboys) and he continues to walk us all the way to the back of the room into the farthest corner. So now the two of us are stuck away from everything in the corner of an empty room that seats at least 100 people if not more. My wife and I have very bad luck when it comes to seating, so now we always say something. We are paying customers and there is no reason to leave us alone in a freezing cold room. So I walk back into the main dining room, get a waiter's attention, and ask if we could get a different table since we are all alone in the corner. The waiter looked surprised and says she'll get the maitre d'. Another maitre d' comes to our table and asks us if we are too cold. I say yes and that we'd like to move because we are the only people in this huge room and that we are seated in the far corner under the fan. He then looks at me as if I asked him if I could relieve myself on the table, says ""Well, the room will fill up quickly"" and proceeds to stare down both me and my wife. I politely ask again if we could move and he hesitatingly takes us to one of the many empty tables in the main dining room. The rest of the meal was fine, but all of this definitely colored our opinion of the place. Also, he ended up being wrong. The room did not fill up at all.

2013-03-18,4.0,"I am always excited when I know we are going to brunch here, but I was a bit disappointed this time around. They didn't have snow crab and the king crab is served either hot or cold.  I enjoyed the oysters and cocktail JUMBO shrimp! There was never a shortage of food, although there was a couple times when I went to get lemons and it wasn't refilled. I don think that the layout could be improved for the seafood line. It always seemed long and the wait took at least 10 minutes.  My highlights: 1. hot king crab- although you couldn't serve yourself for this one, the crab was hot and fresh. I didn't care for the smaller pieces though and I wish they offered crab crackers instead of having customers use their forks and potentially damaging the silverware. 2. Lobster Bisque Soup- yummy!!! Creamy and smooth with chunks of lobster. 3. maple glazed applewood smoked bacon- I am not a bacon person, but this was so good! The bacon is not fatty with lots of meat! 4. Oysters- I liked the oysters except some were small, so you had to take your time in choosing good ones. The person who was shucking the oysters could have done a better job. Almost all my oysters had remnants of the shell, which made eating the oysters less enjoyable since I was constantly having to use my napkin to take the bits of the shell out of my mouth. 5. cantaloupe and king crab cocktail- reminds me of a Thai spicy seafood salad flavor with hints of sweetness. Very good. 6. JUMBO SHRIMP- these pieces of shrimp were huge. Must try! 7. I was in dessert heaven! Enjoyed the Chocolate strata, creme brulee, and chocolate covered strawberries! I would still give the food a 5 star, but this time around, I changed my overall review to 4 because of the service. Our waitress was slow and was sometimes hard to find. My iced tea wasn't refilled in a timely manner. When it came for us to get the bill, I had to ask another server if he could get us our check and that took awhile.

The oysters here were really awesome - and fresh.  However, I thought the sequence of the oysters was a bit off. Some of the milder ones were put after the stronger ones. I am not sure I agreed with their flavor judgment of the oysters. I had the crab cake entree which was quite good without tons of flour or filler. It was truly crabby. But it was TINY.

The breakdown: It's $50/person and includes juice/tea/coffee The cold bar has sushi rolls, ceviche, cold crab claws, lox, shrimp cocktail and OYSTERS. The hot bar has boring brunch foods like sausage, eggs benedict, waffles, omelet station, bacon, etc.  But the hot station also had lobster bisque, crab cakes, hot king crab legs. The dessert bar is magnificent. I don't even like dessert and I tried like 5 or 6 different ones. Shaw's does dessert right, they are all tiny bite size desserts! Little cups of dark, rich chocolate mousse and tiny squares of oreo cheesecake. Yummmy! I'll fill you in on a secret....put 2 crab cakes into your soup bowl then get the lobster bisque on top. It's like a magical, fairy dust, leprechauns leaping type of moment.  Warm, rich, lobster bisque and every bite is filled with nuggets of crab cake. Soooo good.  The server doling out bisque nearly lost it when my boyfriend asked for that combo, it's GENIUS.  Here's another tip (I'm feeling extra generous today), take some candy and a bag of cracker jacks for the road.  BF and I went to watch Django Unchained after our 3 hour brunch..and we snuck some candy in with us.  Our $3 worth of stolen candy made me feel like our $140 brunch was all worth it.  Maybe my math is a little off, or maybe the brine from those 3 dozen oysters is negatively effecting my ability to think, but stealing some candy for the road makes me feel like I'd totally shell out that much for brunch again!",0.9263,0.845,0.118,0.037,0.6288177339901478

We ate at the Oyster bar because 1) I am poor and 2) after a long day of work/classes, we were both too lazy to dress to the nines.  We were seated right away which was nice, and there was live music to boot!  The food itself was great (as it was at the Schaumburg location), but the service was completely lacking.  After having such a fantastic server at Schaumburg (shout out to Mr. Mario!!!!) I guess I was thinking it'd be somewhat similar, but it wasn't at all.  Our server was nice enough, but only came around to bring out our food we had ordered. Now onto the good stuff: the food!  We ordered the clam chowder and good GOD it was delicious--it had nice big chunks of potatoes and clams and the whole thing was absolutely creamy.  The fish and chips (yes, I ordered it again) were just as delicious and my boyfriend (who's been on a hunt for the best fish and chips) said they were #2 in his book (#1 being the fish and chips he had when he used to live in New Zealand), so kudos to you, Shaw's!  We also ordered half a dozen chef's choice oysters and the Oysters Rockfeller which were quite good.  Our last dish ordered was a sushi roll and while I thought it was good (sushi noob here), the bf thought it was ""meh."" Overall, the food was great, but service was not so great, leaving it all with 3 stars.  If you have the choice, I say go to the Schaumburg location for both great food AND great service!",0.9978,0.761,0.219,0.019,0.6187109187109189

2013-01-07,5.0,"Finally decided to try the famous Sunday brunch after hearing good things from friends, family, and fellow Yelpers.  First-rate experience all around and an exceptional brunch menu. We made reservations for earlier in the morning and there was plenty of street parking at that time, although Shaw's does offer valet service.  Entrance of the restaurant is cozy and the restaurant has dimmer lighting and darker interior/furnishings...feels classy but not overwhelmingly fancy.  There's ample space in the foyer near reception if there happens to be a wait.  There is also a bar right in the foyer and this is the area where they set up the chilled seafood/continental breakfast items, as well as the Desserts table.   We were seated in a booth/chairs combo table towards the back of the main dining room.  Perfect for us and the kids.  Our server greeted us as soon as we were comfortably seated, and oriented us to the brunch since it was our first time.  There were others seated near us and a couple directly next to us, but it wasn't crowded, nor did our conversations mix.  The din of conversation around the dining room helped create background noise, though my daughter did remark, ""they don't play any music here!""  She's obviously used to louder, more family-casual restaurants ; )  The traditional English breakfast items are located in the main dining room...the caramelized bacon was to die for and we all had a 2nd/3rd helpings of that.  Other standouts were the crab cakes (meaty pieces of crab not shredded & formed), fried shrimp, lobster bisque (deliciously buttery/creamy with chunks of lobster), the tenderloin (had it medium rare and it's mouth-watering just thinking about it again) and the steamed king crab legs.   There is also a made-to-order omelet and waffle station here.  The chilled seafood table included shrimp cocktail (generously sized), raw oysters, smoked salmon, duck pastrami, crab legs, maki, bagels.  The maki was good, but our 5-year old loves California Rolls and we didn't find any this day...the other rolls were a little too spicy for her. The full Sunday brunch menu is on the Shaw's website...we tried everything and it was all delicious.  I'm a seafood fanatic so this was a dream for me.  I have to say, I enjoyed the steamed king crab over the chilled crab but generally feel steamed/cooked shellfish has a better taste to it than chilled/cold, so no fault of Shaw's here.  If anything, it would have been nice to have a little more variety in the hot crab/shrimp selection (i.e., more steamed crab legs or shrimp other than fried and the cold cocktail).   The Sweets table was fun...not only did they have pastries/cakes/fruit/tarts/cookies to choose from, but they also had different kinds of candy, which was huge with my kids (spun cotton candy, packages of M&Ms, lollipops, tootsie rolls!).  Very nice and different idea. Plates were cleared quickly, water, coffee & tea replenished before we could blink an eye.  The coffee is amazing, btw. Intelligentsia. So happy we finally made it to the brunch at Shaw's.  We love brunching, and this so far, tops our brunch list.  The price can be prohibitive, $48pp, but kids 12 and under are free...so it was completely worth it for our family of 4.  We'll be back and will likely save this brunch for special occasions, though I would happily eat here every Sunday!",0.9983,0.805,0.168,0.027,0.6410271180432472

I am so happy that my mom chose Shaw's. We arrived 10 minutes prior to our 7:30 p.m. reservation, and after a brief 20-minute wait, we were seated by 7:40. Not to worry, the bartender mixed up some delicious cocktails and between people watching and chatting, the time passed quickly.  We were seated in a booth and quickly looked over the menu- classic crab house fare. We started by splitting the jumbo shrimp cocktail and an iceberg wedge. Big, big delicious shrimp. Typically I'm not a fan of the wedge, but that is what my people enjoy - but this one was delicious with plenty of chucky bleu cheese.  I wanted the fresh King crab legs, but, frankly, they are so darn messy, and that's why I've never ordered them in public before. The server, who, by the way, was professional and perfect in every way, encouraged me to order them and promised they would be split and easy to work with. Sides are served family style and our server recommended the potatoes au gratin and the creamed spinach.  They were so good. The crab legs were delicate, sweet and buttery. Split and easy to work with, the crab just melted in my mouth.The dish was served with an aioli, but the server brought me some melted butter and I enjoyed every last bite.

The bacon was too sweet and cut too thick.  Food is definitely better quality than other buffets, and there is a decent variety. Kinda weird that they serve sushi though.

Everyone from the hostess--to the busser--to the food runner--to the server, is a true professional. They really know how to run things here. It's a fine line between being efficient and hovering, and they nail it every time. 2) Oysters are half price from 4:00-6:00 daily. Take advantage and try some oysters that you're not familiar with. My bf is partial to east coast oysters but decided to try some west coast varieties since the price was right...and now he discovered some new favorites. It pays to be adventurous during happy hour. All of their oysters are fresh (goes without saying) and are delicious. 3) Speaking of oysters, they serve theirs the correct way--over ice. Some places serve them over rock salt that *looks* like ice, but isn't. Trust me that you want them served over ice because oysters need to be kept cold as possible. Once they get a little warm they start to ""turn"" and it isn't pleasant. Also, their accompaniments (frozen mignonette, fresh horseradish) are top notch. 4) Their raspberry pie is impossible to stop eating and not to be missed. On my last visit, they were offering a peach/blackberry/plum cobbler that was fantastic. Still, I couldn't pass up the raspberry pie. Naturally I got both. This mantra has always served me well when it comes to food: ""When it doubt, get both.""",0.9849,0.779,0.174,0.047,0.5751748251748252

Went here with my wife and knocked down a dozen oysters and the crab bites.  Both were fresh and delicious.   I've never had the bites before and I must say that it is a wonderful delivery method for crab legs.  All they do is cut the crab leg into 1 1/2"" sections that allows you to easily poke out the meat with a fork and eat... brilliant. The oysters were fresh and briny in the good way, and the menu has wines to pair with them.  Easy peezy. Oh, we also enjoyed the fine oyster shooters.  Think Bloody Mary shot with an oyster in it.  Also superb.",0.9836,0.709,0.256,0.035,0.7492063492063492

2012-08-18,3.0,"I was a little disappointed with my visit here.  Pros: we were sat on time for our reservation, and the front of the house was friendly and orderly. I enjoyed the ""old school"" ambiance of the place. The waiter was nice. Cons: service was lacking. When I finished my iced tea, another was brought out but no one ever removed the empty glass from the 1st iced tea. Runners from the kitchen kept bringing dishes to our table that we did not order. Dirty dishes sat for longer than they should have, both after we finished our appetizers and entrees. Each time we sat for quite awhile with dirty plates in front of us. I don't expect them to be removed immediately....but it just felt like no one was keeping an eye out. Food: we ordered the calamari appetizer and it was nothing special. No different from calamari that's served anywhere else, and in a sea food restaurant I expected something different. I had the crab cake and side of broccoli. Crab cake was fine, but seriously overpriced, especially compared to other places I've had crab cakes in the city. Broccoli was sad. The side was $9 and it was not fresh broccoli. You can tell when it's frozen florets, and that's what this was. It looked like a side of broccoli you'd get at Applebee's.  I've been to many Lettuce restaurants many times, and this is the first time I've left feeling disappointed. Update: they saw the review I posted and contacted me. I've been busy and missed the call, but the fact that they read reviews and contact people says a lot. It's hard to give every single person who visits a perfect experience every time...I would not be opposed to giving this place another try sometime as the contact indicates that they really do care.",0.3224,0.799,0.103,0.099,0.5621510673234811

Our main issue was with the service and the food.  Feeling both rushed to choose our items for drinking and eating from our server is were it began.  Once we picked a bottle of wine the server poured the bottle from the neck each time which is not proper wine service, throughout the meal we had to ask numerous times for water.  We both ordered the filet and crab combo plate, when our dinner arrived I had plastic wrap wrapped around my crab.  I told my server and he said he was sorry and did not ever offer to get me new crab.  After cutting into our filets my wife's was undercooked, she order MW and it came out MR.  Once I was able to flag down our server to let him know it was undercooked, not only did he have an disgusted look on his face but  he handed my wife a side plate to remove the undercooked filet from the table.  My wife was not able to get her filet off her fork onto the side plate, so the server thought it would be a good idea to use his hands to get the filet onto the plate!!!!    When the filet returned it was cooked to the order of beyond well done.   Never had a manager come to the table, never got hot towels to clean our hands at the end of the meal and server gave us a dessert sampler for the errors made??!!!  Not what we thought we were going to get for spending $300 for dinner.  Where I work if a foreign object is ever in the food you buy the meal, that is restaurant operations 101.  A small fish in a big pond.

The interior kind of seems like the inside of a boat. I half expected to see several old men stroll in donned in yacht captain hats.  The bread basket was good-- a crackery nibbler with seeds, and a puffy warm dinner roll. Nothing particularly unique though. The menu is quite extensive-- but nothing stood out to me as being particularly ground-breaking. It appears the menu changes quite a bit to allow for seafood market availability, which is a great thing. It was lobster month, so with lower market prices right now I definitely took advantage. The menu easily shows which options are gluten free, if that need applies to you. Overall the offerings were extensive and you could easily go back to Shaw's again and again and find plenty of appealing dishes to order. Pimm's cup (not served in a Pimp's cup) was refreshing and classic. It's hard to find oysters in the middle of Ohio (where I'm from), so I was thrilled to partake in the oyster sampler. The champagne vinaigrette was a nice, subtle touch. My wedge was tasty, but a little over-dressed. My preference is chunkier components, but these had small bits of tomato and bacon included in a thick layer of dressing and too much bleu.  Still, despite good quality ingredients, I found the food to be a little on the bland side. I had a split lobster sauteed with peas, squash, and other seasonal vegetables. Many of the preparation methods and ingredients would be easy enough to do at home.

We got the crab cake for an appetizer, it was very good. I got the golden crab legs as my entre. They were expensive, but when I order crab legs I don't expect them to be cheap. They cut them down the middle to make it easier to get to the crab meat. So the lazy crab leg enthusiasts will be pleased at the low level of effort needed to enjoy them. The serving size was large and I shared with the two other people in my party. The swordfish steak was fantastic as well, a very nice grilled flavor and large portion size.

Also crispy, and buttery, and the perfect combo for the sandwich.  Fries were good, but honestly, I really wasn't paying attention to them with all the other goodness on the plate.....

2012-02-20,4.0,"Shaw's is a Chicago staple for crabs and seafood.  The restaurant has a bit of the old school steakhouse feel to with white table clothes and dark wood but if you look at the walls you see some of the cheesy seaside decorations you'd expect to find out on the east coast.  The service goes along with the decor - the wait staff wearing jackets and ties.  The wait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu and daily specials.  They also kept our wine glasses full the entire evening - which was nice. Crab is the star of the show.  My wife had the Alaskan king crab legs and they were perfect.  The meat was sweet and just melted in your mouth.  The warm butter was not even needed.  I had the bay sea scallops which were very sweet but a little overcooked.  We had the spicy popcorn shrimp for an appetizer which was good - although I did not expect the Asian spiciness for the dish.  It still worked.  The seafood gumbo was hearty but could have used  shot of tobasco sauce. Between the food and the service, we had an excellent experience at Shaw's and will certainly be back to enjoy the crab legs.",0.9918,0.826,0.174,0.0,0.5326315789473683

I cannot really write a review on a seafood restaurant.   HOWEVER... I did rather enjoy my mixed greens salad and I LOVED the bread.   We came here on a Wednesday night on my husband's birthday.  He wanted seafood and because of my... complications... he is very rarely able to enjoy said cuisine so he takes advantage of the one day a year when he gets to choose where he wants to go.  We had a 7:15 reservation. Like I said before, I ordered the mixed greens salad and ate copious quantities of delicious bread.   My husband ordered stone crab claws or something as an appetizer and whitefish for his entree.  He also ordered a side of the au gratin potatoes.  Ahh, and he ordered clam chowder which he describes as ""verrrrrry good, it was very fresh."" I was set with my bread and salad and I was going to order a side of macaroni and cheese but then our waiter said they could make me a plate of grilled vegetables and I'm very glad I decided to order it because they were soooooooo good.   It seems like fewer and fewer restaurants still do this, but at the end of our meal, they brought him out a piece of chocolate cake with a candle stuck in it - NO CHARGE.   I allowed myself one bite of it, and of course it was delicious.  The husband also ordered a slice of pecan pie since that is his absolute favorite.  He ended up taking the desserts to go since we were both so stuffed.   We've been pretty frugal lately so it was nice to splurge a little and get top notch service.",0.9889,0.815,0.154,0.031,0.6534090909090909

Now onto the positive, once we got our food, it was very good.  Our california rolll we got as an appetizer was GREAT!!! Perfect way to start the meal.  Our main dishes were good as well, the filet's were tender, my garlic shrip were cooked well, and the scallops were right on the money.  My wife subsituted a crab cake for the shrimp and she really, really enjoyed the crab cake. Overall, the food was really good, however the overall experience was less than desired.  I know we aren't a big private party and we don't go downtown for dinner often, but we were customers and definetely felt that we were thrown off to the side.  As far as going back, I don't know, the food was great, but service and overall experience play a big roll in choosing a establishment to celebrate at.  My advice, give this place a chance, but if there are two of you, don't expect the best service.",0.9986,0.773,0.189,0.038,0.4026513029454206

Given that last night was the Saturday before Valentine's Day and our party of 5 was without a reservation, we arrived around 4:30, old-timer's style, and were seated in the oyster bar.  My only complaint was that the seats were very slippery, and all of us felt like we were on the brink of falling out of our seats all night long.  The atmosphere itself was lively without being too loud for easy conversation. For an appetizer, a few of us shared the shrimp ceviche.  If you don't like cilantro, this isn't the dish for you as it does somewhat over-power the dish.  It could be a bit spicier, at least for my tastes.  The king crab entree, however, was delicious!  The legs were packed with sweet meat, and they were cracked sufficiently enough that I didn't have to spend much time getting to my meal.  I challenge you to find better crab in Chicago (other than at CostCo)... Shaw's is pricey, making it the perfect use of my parent's Lettuce Entertain You gift certificates.  Chicago somewhat lacks on seafood choices, but I'd now add Shaw's to the limited list of acceptable seafood restaurants in the city!",0.953,0.858,0.121,0.022,0.5020676691729323

My friend and I are visiting Chicago for the week and I was craving (not fried) seafood- this was just the ticket.  We sat in the oyster bar, which had a really cool buzz about the place, and arrived in time for oyster happy hour- half off!  We ordered two samplers so that we could each have a taste- my friend's favorite variety was the Island Creek oysters, mine was the East Beach Blondie. Highly recommend getting a sampler and tasting the differences in flavor and texture between the varieties. On to dinner- she had the sampler, which came with garlic sautéed shrimp (large, butterflied), scallops (small and very tender- not a but of chewiness that comes with being overcooked) and a decent-sized crab cake (which happily was mostly crab and NOT stuffing...can't stand that!). Her meal was accompanied by a bit of rice and sautéed spinach.  A nicely proportioned meal that leaves you satisfied, not overstuffed.  I ordered the lobster roll. The roll was accompanied by a large pile of fries- they were ok, not as crispy as I prefer, but it's difficult to ruin a fry.  The sandwich on the other hand, was a star!!  Our server (who was great, very knowledgeable and friendly!) mentioned the bread and mayonnaise are made in-house from scratch and the lobsters are fresh-shucked at the restaurant as well.  I cannot emphasize how delicious this sandwich was- a very generous amount of lobster stuffing in a light, toasted roll- the sweet flavor of the lobster really shone through and while most of it was manageable, there were some pretty big mouthfuls in there (this is a good thing!!)

The waiter was very attentive to us and explained everything on the menu well. I got creamed spinach as a side with my Red Alaskan King Crab legs and it was hands down the best creamed spinach I have ever tasted. The crab legs were just amazing and I cannot describe anywhere else I have had better. For dessert we split a chocolate cake and that was great too. Everything about this place is just amazing.

2012-01-12,2.0,"This is a review for Shaw's Sunday brunch.   I think everything was ALMOST there but not quite hitting the mark or meeting my expectations (which I think were pretty lofty based on feedback and recommendations from friends). The cold seafood bar was where I spent most of my time.  The lobster and melon salad, ceviche and lox were the champions of this station and I made sure they knew it.  They also had three different sushi rolls which were nothing special.  They were reminiscent of something you would get at a grocery store.  I ate a ton of them anyway because they weren't terrible and it was all you can eat spicy tuna rolls.  I mean, it was all you can eat ... what's a girl to do?   The most confusing thing about this area was the king crab chunks that a lot of reviewers rave about.  They're one inch sections of king crab legs served cold. They were watery, flavorless and difficult to eat.  It was a lot of work without much reward.  Needless to say I did not go back for more. The waffle station was a pretty big hit for my 6 year old son.  Everything you could put on the waffle was sugar based.  He ate it up.  You can also create your own omelet and have it made to order but every time I walked past the omelet chef wasn't there.  When I want an omelet I expect someone to produce an omelet!  It never happened. The hot food section was pretty massive.  Standouts for me were the broccoli in brie sauce, lobster bisque and mini crab cakes.  The first time I passed through to make my sons plate they had tiny little corned beef has patties with a perfect little sunny side up egg on top.  They were so cute!  I wanted to eat them all! Unfortunately they were out of it every other time I walked past so I didn't get to try them. This also made me sad. The eggs benedict would have been really good if the whites of the eggs weren't runny and undercooked.  The carving station also looked really good but AGAIN there was never anyone there to carve the meat. The dessert room was super cute and obviously the kids were loving it.  All of the desserts were minis so we were able to try quite a bit.  I tried the tiramisu, creme brulee and key lime pie.  All were good ... ish.  Mostly just plain and boring. Our server was great and always on top of drink refills and questions.  The mimosas were actually my favorite part of the experience.  I had the blood orange and the white peach.  Both were fantastic and only $5 each. The biggest issue I had was that they were constantly out of everything.  We had brunch on a Sunday at noon.  New Years Day no less!  You would think it would be stocked.  Several times I would wait in line forever to make a plate and right when I would get to the item I wanted a waiter would take it away to fill it.  The killer was that they were removing trays that were half full.  It was painful and it happened MANY times. I've rarely eaten at a buffet that blows me away but I had high hopes for Shaw's.  The one thing that they do absolutely right is let kids eat free.  However, if I'm going to spend $150 on brunch for two I think it should totally blow my mind.

2011-12-27,4.0,"I really can't believe that last night was my first time dining at Shaw's. First, I'm a HUGE seafood lover, and second, I love dining at any place that exudes that old-school-Chicago feel. So who knows what my problem's been with the whole, 'avoiding a fabulous oyster joint', since Shaw's fulfills both loves, but I finally got over it, and I'm glad I did. My normally-CTA-bound pal and I, randomly had our hands on a vehicle last night and were cruising around looking for somewhere to eat. When I said I was craving fresh seafood, he immediately thought to take me to Shaw's. My friend has lived in Chicago his whole life and has been coming to Shaw's for most of it.  As we walked in, he led me to the bar, which was totally hopping, even on the Monday after Christmas Day. We were greeted by Arturo, who my friend mentioned has worked there as long as he can remember. We later found out that Arturo has, in fact, bar-tended at Shaw's for 26 years. Which explains the tasty cocktails.  Shaw's martini selection is very impressive. But as I always do at a new place, I ordered a bloody mary, which is my go-to litmus test for a bartender and his/her skills. I was not disappointed. The bloody mary could have been a teeny bit more spicy, but it was rich in flavor and won bonus points for garnishes (three blue-cheese olives, lime, celery and a shrimp---BOOM.) We started with a dozen of the chef's choice oyster sampler. DELISH. I honestly can't remember each of the types, but they were all creamy. They are served with this flavored, briney-vinegary-peppery ice along with the usual horseradish and cocktail sauce. But the ice...I HAVE to figure out exactly what's in that. We each had a cup of soup. I had the Lobster Bisque and my friend the Clam Chowder, and we were each so lost in the flavors that we greedily ""forgot"" to offer the other one a taste, haha. For dinner we shared a caesar salad, a lobster (steamed) and the Cape Combination (Nantucket Cape Scallops, Garlic Shrimp, Crab Cake). The lobster was one of the plumpest I've ever had! Not so for the scallops. They were tasty things, but a bit on the wee side. The Combo was good, but for the price, not particularly memorable. Our meal ended with a dessert sampler, which was sent over, on the house. Don't mind if I do! A totally charming and lovely surprise. Hint: like any spendy restaurant, you should go in with the mind-frame that you're there to leisurely enjoy a meal. I say that because it was busy. And it took us a bit to get our order in and our second round of drinks. That said, we weren't in any particular hurry. We were quite content to linger between courses. Also once our food order was in, we got the food exceptionally fast. I also really liked to see the staff pull together with some stellar teamwork.

2011-12-03,2.0,"My rating is really affected by the price of this place.  For $150 before tip, the food and service should have been much better.  We were seated at a booth right next to where the waiters were slamming the foldable stands they place trays on.  There was a strong fishy smell coming from them and it was distracting as the stands were being tossed right into the dividing wall 6 inches from us.  We asked for the stands to be moved and the waiter was nice about it took care of it when we asked, but then, after 10 or 15 minutes, the staff started flinging the stands our way again. Waiter was ok, but we noticed other tables with waiters that were more attentive and explained things better.  A frustration for me is that I cannot eat garlic.  Was told balsamic dressing had garlic, but they would bring vinegar and oil for the salad.  I asked a busboy to bring me some Dijon and a glass and made my own vinaigrette in 30 seconds.  Something that I would think pretty much any beginning level chef could do and also something I would expect a higher end place to do (again at this price- wouldn't expect it at a cheaper place).  My salmon was good, but a very small piece of fish at $33.  Broccoli had a nasty tasting cheese sauce.  Raspberry tart had very sour tasting filling, but the crust was super sugary, should have had the key lime pie.  In any event, meal was ok, not bad at all, but where we were seated, level of service and food were just not worth what we paid.",0.9671,0.835,0.117,0.047,0.5665238095238094
2011-11-27,5.0,"Although I have been here before this is my first trip experiencing the main dining room (in the past I neglected to make reservations and was shunned to the Oyster Bar... Not a bad look but not the main dining room either). Determined not to repeat my past errors I reserved my table via Yelp! and I am happy I did so; it's packed in here!! I received a confirmation via email within minutes and when I arrived I was escorted to my table. My server, Amee, was impeccable! Her drink knowledge was extensive and she even introduced me to Effen Black Cherry. Her demeanor was confident yet welcoming and her service was both attentive and expedient. When it came to my meal I had no dilemmas, however, I did wonder about the Stone Crab and she immediately chimed in, ""Do the 1 piece since you are doing the Oyster Sampler"" and she was correct! Not only did I not make myself look like a glutton I also appreciated the single claw all the more. Dinner consisted of the Nantucket Cape Combination (Nantucket Cape Scallops, Garlic Shrimp, Maryland Style Crab Cake) and I could not have been happier! The scallops were seasoned and cooked perfectly! Often scallops are over or under cooked and appear hard and rubbery. This was not the case. They were melt in your mouth good and the only thing wrong with them was there weren't a plate full! The Garlic Shrimp and Maryland Style Crab were equally good but I am a sucker for a great scallop and they won me over at first bite. I was seated next to a couple celebrating their 1st anniversary. They were a cute and rather entertaining couple who have undergone some major challenges in the past year but did not let that deter them from seeing the silver lining. The trip to Shaw's was planned a year in advance as they are natives but decided to spend their anniversary as a ""stay-cation"" of sorts with a hotel room downtown and a trip to their favorite restaurant. We chatted throughout the meal and they were extremely pleasant. Their meal concluded with Amee bringing out two desserts with the Happy Anniversary inscribed on the plate with chocolate. As I finished my entree Amee returned with Shaw's signature Key Lime Pie and exclaimed, ""We didn't want you to feel left out"" as she placed it on the table. I was flabbergasted. floored. shocked. and amazed. I didn't know what to say. I was surprised beyond imagination and all I could muster was 'WOW!!' and a bewildered thank you. Typically not a fan of key lime pie I decided to indulge out of respect and humility. I am glad I did! It was sweet and not as tart as I expected or have previously experienced. This was the perfect crescendo for a wonderful meal. Amee was great and I can't wait to make my next visit to the Chi to take a seat in the dining room once again.

Being from California I've been spoiled with fresh seafood my entire life but was still blown away at the quality of Shaw's. There are two dining room options: the bar which is to the right when you enter the restaurant and the formal dining room to the left. The place is huge, with each turn you find more and more tables and additional rooms that I never new existed. Caution: the floors are waxed well so please watch your step! Let's talk about the food. The menu is overwhelming, so many options that you feel you need to eat there several times before you can really order everything you really want. My favorites so far are the following: any of their fresh oysters, king crab bites, salmon nigiri, sampler platter of crab cakes, calamari and buffalo shrimp. Plenty of sampler options and half orders so you aren't stuck with more food than you can eat. It's a great date night location but I also suggest going with many people so everyone can share their food! Most recently I sat at the bar and enjoyed live music and lively atmosphere. I definitely plan to go this route once again even though the menu options are less than the formal dining room.

They've been setting the bar for me on succulent legs for years - think at least a decade if not more - and I've yet to find another establishment near or far that can touch the consistently impeccable quality and flavor of this ample signature dish. If you enjoy huge, sweet, glorious crab, then look no further, this is hands down the best. Incomparable in every way, I swear it to the Red King Gods! They may send you back a pretty penny or two - $65 for the full order - but are worth every last butter-laden cent.  Of course, Shaw's has much more than just Crab Legs, and ya know what? All of it is pretty damn phenomenal too. From the ever-changing daily Fresh Catch, to the beautifully briny Oysters and, one of my all time favorites, the uberbountiful Grand Cold Shellfish Platter with a serious selection of Whole Maine Lobster, Oysters, Crab Fingers, Cocktail Shrimp and Alaskan Red King Crab Bites - it's a deluge of seafood delight for sharing but experienced even better as a gluttonous individual intake.

I think smoked salmon is already really good, but pastrami cured salmon?!? It was really, really good! Of course there were plenty of king crab bites as well on my plate. My gf went crazy with the oysters. Honestly, that section unbelievable.  Main buffet was really good as well. My favorite Shaw's side, the broccoli and brie, was part of the buffet which made me really happy. Asides from that, they also have their lobster bisque, mini crab cakes, and hot snow crab. All of those items I've had during dinner and all that I really enjoy. Their corned beef hash and eggs benedict were also really good. Actually, I really enjoyed the hash as the presentation was very nice.  I hate that I only had enough room for one waffle as I thought the waffle I had was really good. Very nice and fluffy and with banana foster's on top just over the the top good. They also have an omelette bar in that section.  Then there was the dessert section... OMG... Big chocolate covered strawberries, chocolate covered oreos, key lime tarts, cotton candy, fresh fruit cups... I would go on, but I'm sure my point was made. GF was very pleased with the dessert section. They also have specials on different mimosas and they have a bloody mary bar.

Needless to say, I stuffed my 5'1 self silly.  Everything was delicious!  I would strongly recommend the melon & king crab that comes in a martini glass as its flavors were more complex with mint added in.  Also, you have to get the oysters (so fresh!), the carmelized bacon (so salty and sweet!) and the key lime pie tart.  The dessert room by itself is wonderful. The service was impeccable.  Even though it is a buffet and you get your own food, our plates were always cleared when needed, and our waters and coffee were always filled.  Our server even gave my mom a complimentary mimosa for no reason.  I will def be returning when I come back to the chi!",0.9457,0.885,0.104,0.011,0.6407894736842107
2011-08-21,4.0,"This place has great food, everybody knows that. What a lot of people may not know is how good their brunch is as well! I rarely get impressed by buffet brunches, but I gotta give this brunch some props For $45 a head, this pricing is well justified. There are basically five main areas - the bloody mary / bar area, the fresh cold seafood bar, the omelet and waffle station, the grand buffet & carvery area, and the sweets table - all of them outstanding. There are lots to choose from, sure, but you can't equate quantity with quality, and this place definitely understands the importance of quality. Everything here is top notch. The cold seafood bar has a wide selection of fresh cocktail tiger shrimps, crab legs, raw oysters, sushi / rolls, seafood salad & ceviche. Moving onto the omelet & waffle station - this place has one of the best waffle I've ever had. It was cooked with just the right amount of batter & heat. A short break later, we started tackling the grand buffet & carvery area. Lobster bisque is a great starter, then chase it with some roasted beef tenderloin, corned beef hash with a sunny side egg on top, crab cakes, and carmelized bacon. The broccoli was actually pretty darn good as well because they cooked it with an alfredo sauce and lobster.  If you still have room at this point, you gotta hit up the sweets table...and by table I mean a whole separate private room full of 25+ kinds of desserts. It's like a mini Willy Wonka sweets factory.  Come here hungry, but also come here not dressed like a slob. The Schaumburg location may be more casual, but the downtown crowd looks a bit more dressy, even on a Sunday. I wouldn't recommend bringing loud, obnoxious kids to this place as you'll certainly get lots of looks from others.",0.998,0.702,0.261,0.037,0.6456963946547281

We arrived around 12:45 for the Sunday Brunch (approx $45pp), and I feel like we could have spent half a day there.  The nice thing is... there really is no rush.  The last reservation they accept is at 1:30, and they basically keep bringing out food as long as people are eating.  You don't have to worry about ""missing the good stuff"" because everything is refilled pretty quickly. We started out at the cold food table, enjoying some delicious seafood pasta, king crab, cocktail shrimp, oysters, ceviche, and sushi.  Everything was amazing.  I especially enjoyed the crab and the pasta, where my husband was fawning over the oysters, shrimp, and ceviche.   About this time we discovered the Bloody Mary / Mimosa station, which is an additional $5 to your meal.  Another great selection of delicious beverages, definitely worth the extra bucks. Onto the next table, I had steamed snow crab legs, broc & cheese with lobster sauce, jumbo fried shrimp, and lobster penne pasta with creme sauce.  Mmm...  My husband also had the steak, and a few other sides... all of which he thoroughly enjoyed. Did I mention they have lobster bisque?  Oh yes they do.  Finally, I found some lobster bisque SO GOOD that it challenges the ""best bowl"" that was previously on my list.  I think this is it, folks.  It's amazing and it's on a brunch buffet.  I cannot stress this enough : do not leave this building without putting bisque in your face. Finally, there is the sweet room.  It is an entire room full of dessert options that you don't really have room for but must eat.  So, we wandered in and painstakingly selected a variety of sweet treats to try.  From the fudge to the chocolate, the mouse to the strawberries, everything was divine.  It was especially fun to watch kids wander into this room unprepared, looking like little lost children in Willy Wonka's word.  I watched a girl giggle madly while she plucked cotton candy down from the tree and then skipped off with a plate full of candy.   It is a beautiful world here at Shaws.  It's probably a GOOD THING I do not live in Chicago, because I would gain 20lbs every Sunday.",0.9969,0.787,0.189,0.024,0.5477777777777777

It was good, but not as fresh as the ones found in LA. Ordering the spring rolls was the best decision I had made about the meal. Truth is, they aren't really spring rolls since they were deep fried. They come packed with blue crab, with big leaves of lettuce for wrapping and peanut sauce for dipping. OMG, it was SO GOOD! Honestly, I enjoyed eating all four pieces and they are the reason why I had to take half of the lounge combination home as leftovers. I tried a bite or two of each item in the Lounge Combination just so I knew how it tasted fresh from the kitchen. The scallops were a bit chewy and soft, not what I expected. The shrimp was grilled just right with plenty of flavor. The crab cake was done well; not too soft and not hard as a rock. The bed of flavored rice complimented the three parts extremely well. I had a ball eating the leftovers a few hours later. =) The service was okay, just a little slow (getting the check took 15 minutes), but it was likely from the busy night with a basketball game going on. Next trip back here would be to try the oysters themselves, hopefully on a slower night!",0.9949,0.812,0.169,0.019,0.3995918367346939

It is!  Shaw's has the best brunch I have ever eaten anywhere, hands down.  Besides traditional breakfast fare that includes an omelet and waffle station, Shaw's features its specialties - seafood, especially crab.  There is a cold station that includes large shrimps, sushi (both shrimp and spicy tuna), lox (both regular and smoked salmon), oysters on the half shell, and sliced sections of large crab legs.  The way they cut the legs makes it very easy to pop out a big, delicious chunk of tasty crab meat.  There is also a long hot station that includes snow crab legs and claws (yum yum), french fried jumbo shrimp, and miniature crab cakes with good pieces of meat.  Also tried the baked salmon that was perfectly cooked, along with broccoli topped lightly with cheese mixed with lobster bits.  Outstanding.  There is much more as well that I did not try - au gratin potatoes, roast beef sliced upon request, and soup, to name a few. And, there is a great dessert station that has a mix of breakfast friendly sweets like fruit bowls containing mango, kiwi, and cantalope topped with blueberries and raspberries.  But they also have fantastic lunch desserts such as creme brulee (had to have two!) and something in a tall narrow glass that tastes similar to tiramisu, with perfectly textured cream. The atmosphere is  classy and the main dining room has a 1940's feel, disconnected from the outside windows and with a soft big band sound playing in the background.  Service was top notch, and they were quick to refill dishes on the buffet lines.

We had the shrimp cocktail as an app and they were so fresh, they popped in your mouth. My picky husband actually ate them they were that good.  For an entre I had the grilled halibut and it was delicious. Nice grilled flavor, and it came surrounded by fresh peas - I'm pretty sure these peas were just shelled prior to cooking, they were so fresh. Hubby had the lobster tails and they were cooked to perfection. Ever had a lobster tail that wasn't cooked right? Gross. These were absolutely perfect. We shared the au gratin potatoes as a side. One word. Wow. Cheesy and creamy and smokey and gut-busting delicious. They comped us free dessert (for hubby's bday), which was very nice. We ordered the chocolate cake and they threw in the sampler which includes key lime pie, pecan pie, raspberry pie and creme brulee. Everything was very very good but if I could only order one thing, it would be the chocolate cake, no question. So overall we had a fantastic meal.

2011-04-06,3.0,"I have mixed feelings about my experience at Shaw's. I wanted it to be great, but after much discussion I just can't say that it was.  First off, atmosphere. As one of my friends said, ""It looks like a place where middle aged men go for business dinners."" That isn't necessarily bad, especially if you are a middle aged man looking for a business dinner location, but my friends and I were definitely on the younger end of the demographic and to me it was quite noticeable. We were seated at a large round table where I literally could not reach the wine list that was placed in the middle. This wouldn't have been bad for a large group, but for only six of us it made it really hard to have a conversation with everyone at the same time.  As far as food goes, it was all good but not great. We shared some oysters which were really fresh and tasted great as well as an order of calamari which seemed on the small side. I ordered the grilled halibut with roasted vegetables. It came with a heavier sauce that I was not expecting and the top of my halibut was more grilled than I'd prefer - to the point where it was hard and chewy. The roasted vegetables were just ok; I enjoyed the broccoli and macaroni and cheese sides that we got as a table to share a lot more. Another friend at the table ordered the surf and turf and said that his steak he ordered rare was actually quite overdone on the outside and cold in the middle.  Unfortunately I was even disappointed by the desserts. The peppermint ice cream was fantastic - but it was really just peppermint ice cream at the end of the day. We all agreed that the chocolate cheesecake and triple chocolate cake were underwhelming.  Service was fine. Our waiter was a little stuffy, hard to understand/communicate with and there was a large time lapse between entrees and dessert, but no real issues. I was really excited for Shaw's but at the end of the day I can't help but feeling like I'd wish we'd gone to Joe's Stone Crab instead.",0.9965,0.745,0.198,0.058,0.4947315096251267

2011-03-31,2.0,"Slowly but surely I'm getting through my large backlog of posts. Our dinner at Shaw's was in mid-December ""celebrating"" the holidays. We had a gift card or two and wanted to splurge for the occasion. Shaw's is an established Chicago institution, especially their no reservations oyster bar right off the main entrance. I can imagine back in the day that if you wanted really good and fresh seafood, you went to Shaw's. Unfortunately for them competition in the space is huge and people can get great crab or oysters or fish from many outlets. My biggest complaint is that Shaw's feels like it is still living in the 60s or 70s without many modern touches. Not to offend anyone, but it reminds me of a place your grandparents would take you to. Maybe that's the point and I'm missing something, but somewhat strange and surprising coming from a LEYE restaurant in this day an age (see: Brasserie Jo turns into Paris Club). The other large disappointment with Shaw's was the value. Most items seemed very pricey, and especially so after we ate them. Erica and I both ordered seafood, not normally a surprise, but it was her small piece of fillet on her surf-n-turf that was the tastiest item on the table! It could very well be a personal mismatch of style and menu, we enjoyed the service and elegance of the old fashion scene, we were dissapointed in the flavors of the food that evening. I started with a salad and Erica ordered her favorite of lobster bisque. My plate of mixed greens was unremarkable and if I remember correctly, slight over dressed. I shouldn't complain too much because I order mixed greens to feel a bit healthier before consuming too much food later in the meal, but I still would like to see something a bit more complicated than what I could make myself at home. Erica did love her soup and was one of the highlights of the meal. Call me a bad blogger, or blame me for waiting too long to write, but I can't remember the type of fish I ordered with this meal. I do remember that it wasn't amazing, and I didn't love that creamy white sauce on the fish and brussel sprouts. It may have been special, but I do give a lot of credit to Shaw's for using and partnering with Shedd Aquarium's Right Bite Card. It's a great resource to understand which fish are sustainably caught or farmed and which fish to avoid. Sustainable fishing practices are very important to me and I appreciate restaurants keeping that in mind as well. Erica made the better order decision with a seafood surf 'n turf medley. The dish came with shrimp, scallops and a small fillet. I had a bite of the scallops and fillet and was much more impressed than with my grilled fish. We also ordered potatoes au gratin for a side - and that was a handful to get down. It was a bit cheesy/creamy/rich for my liking, but then maybe I shouldn't be ordering au gratin potatoes. It was a ""holiday celebration"" dinner for us so we had to go all out and finish with a bang. There's no better way than with peppermint ice cream and hot fudge. It was my favorite dish of the night and it did not last long. I'd go back for that alone, or find a way to replicate that in my house. Delicious. Erica certainly out-ordered me that night and if she were writing this post it might have a completely different tone. We both agreed that most people dining were there on a ""special occasion"" or something similar, but that the space felt dated. The seafood we ordered was disappointing, but we did not have the tradition crab and oyster selection Shaw's is known for. And while we had first class service, our final bill was a bit much for the tastiness of the food and our overall experience. Shaw's is still a quality place with great service and a dependable meal, but maybe it's time to freshen up the experience.",0.9984,0.763,0.176,0.061,0.5042781039356383

2011-03-28,5.0,"In my opinion, Shaw's is a restaurant that does everything right. From service, to food, to ambience, everything at Shaw's just works everything to perfection. My most recent visit was just this past weekend for my girlfriend's birthday. I left a little note in the Open Table comments section that it was her birthday and we were looking forward to our dinner. Upon our arrival the hostess wished my boo a happy birthday, that's the kind of attention to detail you can't help but love. We ended up arriving about 20 minutes late for our reservation. We went over to the bar ordered a round and while we chatted the maître d came up to us and immediately started apologizing for our wait. We informed him that it we were the ones that were late, and we were just ordering a round and that there was no problem. The maître d said that since it was my boo's birthday we shouldn't have to wait anyway, and ushered us in to the dining area. That's the kind of service you just don't find at your average top restaurant. We started with the oysters. For years I have tried, but have yet to find a Chicago spot that can compete with Shaw's oysters. Sure, some places will charge you more for smaller oysters, but they don't taste better. You can definitely find cheaper oysters, but the $1 oyster deals don't compete on flavor. When it comes to selection, taste, and preparation, nobody in Chicago does oysters better than Shaw's. My boo also got the lobster bisque as an appetizer. I'm not a huge lobster bisque fan, but my boo is, so I've tried countless bisques all over Chicago. One of the few bisques I've actually enjoyed, is Shaw's. The bisque is seasoned to perfection, and the meaty chunks of lobster are substantial. Too often I'll try a bisque and wonder if there's even lobster in it. You won't have that problem at Shaw's. For entrees we had steak, lobster and crab legs. Even though Shaw's is a go-to spot for seafood, don't think they can't cook a good steak. The filets are perfectly cooked and melt in your mouth. I am a big fan of the Alaskan king crab legs. I'm not really a regular crab eater, they're a chore to eat with all the various hammers and plyer like devices you must employ to get a tiny bite of crabby goodnes, but Shaw's gives you huge legs that are pretty much broken up for you, so novices like me don't end up making a mess. The lobster is always stellar. Also don't miss out on the mashed potato side for buttery goodness. For dessert they brought my boo out a free piece of cheesecake with a birthday candle and everything. Perfection.  Throughout the whole experience at Shaw's our server, Patrick, was fantastic. He helped make the night a perfect birthday for my boo. When you go to Shaw's you know you're going to end up dropping some coin, and this is the kind of service you expect from a high end restaurant, but often don't get. On other visits to Shaw's we also received exceptional service.  I would heartily endorse Shaw's for just about any group of people, be they tourists, family, or hardcore Chicagoans. You can't go wrong here. After our birthday dinner, my boo turned to me and said ""What's the best restaurant in Chicago?""  After my last visit to Shaw's, it's hard to argue for anything else.",0.9932,0.803,0.13,0.067,0.5470560702913643

The bacon -- I've only had bacon on this level from Telepan's brunch -- perfectly crisp and chewy and a little sweet.  Also really liked the chicken artichoke strata and the chocolate cake. As you can see, incredible variety -- the dessert ROOM was like a child's fantasy come true, with jars of candies, chocolate strawberries, cookies, creme brulee, etc. etc.  Wish this place were in NYC.",0.9847,0.783,0.217,0.0,0.6833333333333335

2011-02-20,1.0,"We went today for the Restaurant Week menu.  I called and made reservations, because there were eight in our party.  I expressly mentioned our desire to order the Restaurant Week selection.  When we arrived, we were seated in the restaurant near the buffet.  We were not given menus, and when we asked for them, we were told  that we could only have the buffet, and if we wanted anything else, we needed to go to the Oyster Bar on the other side of the restaurant.  They actually prepared a table for all of us over there, but we were confused as to why they originally sat us where they did (after I had mentioned on the phone what we were coming to eat), and why they didn't ask us on arrival what we wanted.  It is, after all, Restaurant Week.  I noticed that we weren't the only table that had to get up and move, either.  Very awkward for everyone, and bad first impression. Lunch took over two hours.  It was the worst, slowest service any of us have ever received.  The food seemed like it had been sitting in the window for some time.  Yes, we had a large party, but nothing we ordered was complicated.  Six of us had the same thing: a cup of lobster bisque, the lobster roll (a sandwich), and mini key lime pie (which was extremely mini).  We had an oyster sampler for an appetizer.  Six of us ordered the same drink.  However, the servers never could seem to remember what we had, the very few times they came around.  No one apologized for how slowly everything came out.  You know the feeling-- sitting there with dirty dishes in front of you-- looking around for the waiter, hoping he or she will realize you still exist. The other issue was that the server deliberately mislead our friends.  When our two of friends ordered their dishes, the server asked, ""Soup or salad?""  We have all worked in the food industry.  We know that if you upsell, you need to present it in a way that the customers know they are paying for it.  So my friends were surprised that soup or salad came with what they ordered.  Until we got the bill-- $7 additionally per salad.  When we complained, the server said he would take it off, but acted like he hadn't done anything wrong.  They knew they didn't need to give us good service, because due to the size of our party, 18% gratuity was added on to the bill. I have a real problem with restaurants that participate in Restaurant Week and then treat those patrons as 2nd class citizens.  Instead of showing us how wonderful your restaurant is, you basically just turned us off from ever returning.  There are better seafood places in the city, and we will take our hundreds of dollars there instead. Oh, and to the server, like I said, we worked in the restaurant industry.  Had you done your job well, you would've gotten a better tip than just 18%.",0.9923,0.817,0.132,0.051,0.5619866071428572

2010-12-26,4.0,"Food:  5 Service:  4 Atmosphere:  4 Value:  3 Shaw's is definitely an upscale, special occasion-type place.  My wife and I had some Lettuce Entertain You gift cards so we decided to treat ourselves for a belated Hanukkah dinner.  We had reservations on a Saturday night at 8:00, but when we showed up were informed that they were running about 20-30 minutes behind.  After a couple stiff (but expensive) martinis at the bar, we were more than ready to enjoy an elegant dinner. Yes the name is Shaw's ""Crab House"" but it's actually pretty kosher-friendly, with a number of sushi and fish options.  After a couple glasses of wine, we decided on having the Tuna, Yellowtail, and Salmon Sashimi and Acupulco Roll (Tuna, Avocado, Jalapeno, and Cilantro) for an appetizer, and sharing the Day Boat Flounder (with potato-chive crust and tomato-herb butter) and Sauteed green beans for our entree. The sushi was everything you would expect from a great seafood restaurant.  In a word:  FRESH.  The Sashimi was a work of art-a perfect cut of every type of fish, and plainly, yet elegantly presented.  A little wasabi was all each piece needed.  The acupulco roll was equally as delicious.  I knew what I would be getting from the tuna, and the avoado and cilantro added great flavor, while the jalapeno added a nice crunch and subtle heat.  It was really a breath of fresh air to have such tasty sushi after my experience at Sushi Mura (see my review). The flounder was recommended by our waitress and I'm sure glad we chose it.  It was fresh, flaky, buttery, and downright delicious.  The potato chive crust acted like a small layer of hash browns adorning the tender piece of fish.  There was a depth of flavor and texture that I was just not expecting from a fish course.  The green beans added a nice contrast-perfectly cooked (more al dente, which I like), lightly seasoned, and the butter sauce was more accentual than overpowering.   Overall, I expected a nice dinner and that's exactly what I got.  I will admit I was close to giving my first 5-star review, but with the high prices I just couldn't justify it.  It's also hard to compete with Joe's Stone Crab (one of my favorites and one of the best restaurants in Chicago), which I still prefer.  Nonetheless, Shaw's was still worth wait.   [Thanks for reading my review and be sure to check out my other reviews on Yelp.  My mission is to find restaurants that have great vegetarian, kosher, and vegan fare.  On every review, I rate food, service, atmosphere, and value on a 1-5 scale to give you quick and easy overview of the restaurant.  I love cooking, eating, and doing both with my friends and family.  I always welcome your questions, comments, and suggestions so contact me on Yelp or Facebook if you want to share ideas.]",0.9994,0.718,0.275,0.008,0.5996092796092796

2010-12-18,4.0,"It's a good thing my work had our Christmas Party here because otherwise I'd never be able to afford this place on my current shoestring budget. As such, this restaurant follows in the grand tradition of other River North eateries like Ben Pao and Vong's Thai Kitchen (RIP). The atmopshere is upscale and classy, the sort of place you could see Sinatra hanging out in with Dean Martin and having a laugh over martinis about some broad they both knew. For appetizers, we had tempura shrimp, shrimp cocktail, and a delicious blue crab, cheese, and artichoke dip on toast. Fantastic.  Potential CrabHousers be on notice though. There is a difference between getting a lot of food, and getting GOOD food. The portions are pretty small, so if you're expecting the Joe's Crab Shack approach to seafood, you may not find it here. As an appetizer, I had a bowl of their gumbo, which had just the right amount of meat and rice, with peppers and spices that popped, but didn't scorch. As a main course, I followed up with a crusted Florida red Grouper with mushrooms. It was light and flaky and the kind of fish that's meant to be enjoyed small bites at a time.  Dessert brought a relatively inexpensive dessert menu, only two dollars for ""Just a bite"", which was more than sufficient to satisfy the sweet factor. I had the key lime pie which was a little more tart than I'm used to in a key lime pie. However, this only added to the flavor.  If I have one complaint about Shaw's, it's that the service can be a little slow. I asked for a wine glass, and it was a good 20 minutes before I even saw someone again to ask where it was.

It almost felt like a communal experience as everyone looked like they were having a good time. My second visit was with family before attending a play.  This time we ate in the dining room, which has more of a slacks and dinner jacket feel, but not stuffy....

Shaws Brunch won me over completely.  The service is divine and the food was fresh, tasteful and in petite sized portions.  My  first favorite were the Crab & Cantaloupe cocktail which was flavorful with the sweetest cantaloupe you could ever want.  I thought that was the best there until I had the eggs Benedict  which made every other Eggs Benedict I have ever had taste like an Egg McMuffin.  Thinking nothing could top these two sublime creations until I entered the dessert room and selected the cutest creme brulee I had ever seen whose taste surpassed its presentation.  How do they keep the sugary top crunchy? We demurred on the Bloody Mary and Mimosa bar and asked for Poinsettias instead and it was their pleasure to provide this off the menu delight.  Perfect coffee completed the meal that I continues on in my mind.  Perfect Sunday...well...if the Bears had won.",0.9938,0.687,0.236,0.076,0.6006410256410256

Chalk me up for my first Royster with the Oyster event.

I feel like I did okee for a noob - suckin' down 9 oysters before ""Two-at-a-time Tony"" next to me put his big paw in the air as the winner. I felt honored just to be in the same field as a living legend. We came back on Friday for the big tent event. Great bands playing da blues, sudsy brews and amazing food - including a butterific lobster roll, fried jumbo shrimp, tasty jambalaya, and, of course, cold as the North Sea oysters.

2010-10-12,4.0,"Note: this review only pertains to the 25 cent oyster special We went into Shaw's last night for their 25 cent oyster special from 3-6. We arrived around 4 pm and there was about a half hour wait for a table at the oyster bar so we decided to try and grab seats at the bar. We ended up waiting about 10 minutes and 2 tables opened up. Hooray!  The server at the bar immediately asked us if we were in for the oyster special and asked if she should put in an order for some oysters. A few minutes later, we were happily eating a dozen oysters each, bread from their bread bowl (3 types of bread, all pretty good), and sipping on our martini and beer. We ended up eating 1 more dozen each for a total of 4 dozen between the 2 of us. The oysters were pretty fresh (which surprised me because at 25 cents, I wasn't expecting much). Some of them though were oddly creamy... there was a milky liquid in them which kind of weirded me out. But this was only about 1 or 2 of them in each dozen. So, overall still pretty good. Here's some 411 for all the 1st timers: 1. The oysters are 25 cents each but you cannot choose the type of oyster that you want. The 25 cent special only applies to the one that they are serving during the special. See #2 2. Half off all other oysters (so you can still sample the others at a decent price) 3. You can order 2 dozen oysters at a time",0.9726,0.889,0.111,0.0,0.5723727422003283
2010-10-10,4.0,"Came here on a Saturday night without reservations since hubby had a craving for oysters (we had just watched a Mad Men episode where they were downing oysters and martinis). We sat at the oyster bar (no reservations on a Saturday night in Chicago = take whatever you can get). Having our meal at the bar wasn't a bad experience at all; the food and drinks came quickly! Although we were surprised that there was a child sitting at the bar with his parents (um...) We had: 1. Bloody Mary's: Perfect amount of alcohol to spicy tomato content. At other places, the ratio is usually wrong. Also it came with 2 olives, a pickle, and a cocktail shrimp. Hands down, the best I've had outside of New Orleans. For $11 per drink, it was well worth it. 2. Dozen oyster sampler: Very good, tasted fresh. Satisfied hubby's craving. However the cost sucked ($24/dozen) compared to New Orleans ($12/dozen). 3. Oyster Rockefeller: Okay, too much spinach and not enough cheese. Also only 4 oysters came out, for the cost we expected at least 6! 4. Lounge Sampler: 3 shrimps, 3 scallops, 1 crab cake on a bed of rice and spinach. The scallops were perfectly cooked and sweet. The shrimp had the shell on it still, which I didn't cared for. The crab cake was good, but the ones I had in Baltimore were better. The rice was dry and the spinach was standard. The platter was not worth $30 for what we got. 4. Raspberry pie a la mode: yummy!!! Perfect tartness to sweet vanilla ice cream ratio.  All in all, a good experience. Service was good for the bar. Would come back for Bloody Mary's, oysters, and dessert. Don't know if the cost of the entrees are worth it. Had other entrees at Shaw's in the past and it has not impressed thus far.",0.9885,0.785,0.165,0.05,0.5736820586820588

My review is focusing on the food/service/ambiance we experience, not on why you are there or who is paying for the meal. We had the oyster sampler which was excellent to be expected.  Although the frozen vinagrette sauce was a bit overwhelming, not a good match to delicate fresh oyster flavors.  Nothing beats some few drops of lemmon juice to bring them alive! But I would recommend this appetizer. The bread basket was interesting but removed and took multiple requests to two waiters/bus persons to get it back.  Our waitress was missing in action most of the time.  Lobster bisque was good, but small portion and no lobster chunks to speak of. We had the Walleye fresh fish filet (from great lakes), soft white and tasty, with a delicious lobster sauce around it. Would recommend if available, I never had it before.  The Seafood sampler was also good but not great! Shrimps were carved in their shell, scallops soft, lightly grilled on each side which melted in your mouth, the crab cake too dry, too much bread and a sauce that did not match the flavor. Had much better crab cakes for a lot less money. We also ordered spinash which were left on the plate, too oily & watery for our taste. You can expect good food, but because of the service and some of the dishes I gave them 3 star rating, for the price they have to deliver a better experience for the foody.  These are just our comments for our food taste, your taste and experience could be different.",0.9937,0.799,0.178,0.023,0.47412280701754395

2010-09-13,5.0,"Shaw's Crab House appears to be birthday and special occasion central and this weekend for us, was no exception.  Heading to Chicago to celebrate my 37th birthday, I wanted to pick somewhere new to us and something good.  I had a number of options in mind, thanks to Yelp and word of mouth but waiting until the last minute to make reservations, we found Shaw's was one of the last restaurants on our list with spots open only 2 days from our arrival.  We were NOT disappointed! I adore seafood and living in the Midwest, especially northern Indiana, it is damn tough to find anything of quality.  Reading about Shaw's on Yelp and on their website, I was attracted about the comments to freshness, sustainability and in season. Upon arrival, the restaurant itself is very inviting.  Cozy, old school, whatever you want to call it - it very much reminded me of the feeling in St. Elmo's Steakhouse in Indianapolis.  Plush red booths, dark wood, subtle lighting.  I was impressed with the service - the hostess, the gentleman that showed us to our table, the waitress and the table clearers.  Everyone hustled, everyone fussed over us, everyone wanted to make sure we had everything we needed at every moment. Now, the food.  We are very light eaters and judging from the portion sizes on the plates at tables around us, we knew that despite the great descriptions from our waitess, we would never be able to finish a whole dinner each.  So, we decided to go the tapas route and work our way around the appetizer menu.  Here are our choices: The Pometini - my drink, very good ingrediants but surprising light on alcohol given the $11.99 price tag. Blue Crab Spring Rolls - bursting with crab and the perfect combo of tender inside and crispy outside. Maryland Style Crab Cake - as others have said, very little filling in this crab cake, it was a wonder it stay together.  Nothing but giant pieces of tender, flavorful crab.  A little lemon is all you need. Seafood Gumbo - huge pieces of seafood but the broth reminded us of a vegetable soup and not so much a gumbo.  Very tasty though. Lobster Bisque - soup literally melted in your mouth and had very generous sized pieces of lobster. Nigiri-Sashimi Sushi - 2 pieces of Spicy Tuna and 2 of Red King Crab - this is where we could really tell the quality of the ingredients, when they were raw.  The tuna was the best I had ever had in sushi which I suppose isn't saying much given my locale.   The Red King Crab had a HUGE piece of crab on top with rice on the bottom wrapped in a strip of seaweed.  I could come to Shaw's, eat nothing but the sushi and be a very happy person. We ordered the Key Lime Pie to go and it made for a great late night snack.  Very light, very tart and the almonds in the crust rather than sprinkled on top, as I have seen other restaurants do, gave it a great flavor and texture.  With a drink, all of our apps and the dessert, our total bill with tip was around $100 and worth every penny. I know Shaw's may be pretty old school and I am probably the last person to have tried the place but I am glad I finally made it.",0.9952,0.826,0.134,0.04,0.53418926951185

It's not that I don't like seafood - it's just I've never had an occasion to go out to a nice seafood place and take in delicious scallops, shrimp, fish, etc. I'm a huge fan of fresh fish, so I was excited to see my friend but also curious to try seafood in Chicago. Anyway, I came here on a weeknight with an old friend and her family. First of all, it was so great to see them so I was in a happy mood to start off. There was a 45 minute wait, so we got drinks and caught up. Their gin & tonic is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. My friend got a Bloody Mary, and honestly, it was like a meal in a cup! A tall glass with tomato juice and liquor, topped with a giant pickle, celery, jumbo shrimp, and olives. Seriously, we all gasped when she got her drink! Forty-five minutes passed by super fast and we were seated next to a window. Jazz started playing in a corner opposite from ours almost immediately after we sat down, which put us in a good mood. I ordered the Fish & Chips, and it was incredibly divine. The batter the fish was dipped in was incredibly light and crispy - the fish itself melted in my mouth. The fries were cooked and seasoned perfectly, and the cole slaw and tartar sauce were great complements to the dish.  My friend and her family ordered as follows: two orders of scallops and rice, one order of salmon, and another order of a yellow fish. Everyone enjoyed their meals, and I would say we were all very pleased with the quality of the food and the presentation. Also, they have sushi here, which is kind of cool/odd (since it's not a ""Japanese"" restaurant). But I suspect that the sushi/sashimi here is wonderful, just by how awesome their non-sushi dishes were. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal and a good time.

2010-08-10,4.0,"This review is based solely on their Sunday brunch buffet. If you love seafood for brunch, read on... The buffet is made up these sections: Cold seafood, Hot food, Carving station, Omelette and waffle station, Dessert station (displayed inside a room by itself) My favorite is the cold seafood station (of course): oysters, shrimps, crab legs, ceviche, sushi rolls, salad. Wonderful. Only thing was that the oysters were stacked on top of the other so there were bits of shell impurities on the oyster flesh.  Hot food station was meh. But then, I wasn't really there to eat their hot food. Selections include bacon, sausages, halibut, green beans, potato au gratin, lobster pasta. Carving station: beef tenderloin and turkey. The beef was medium rare mmmmm. When I went up to the waffle station, there was only one piece of waffle left on the tray. The chef asked if I could wait to get fresh waffles. I had already put the last piece of waffle from the tray onto my plate but I said sure why not. The chef was kind enough to say that he would take my waffle back and he then gave me a plate of waffles fresh from the skillet. The dessert station was inside a small room. For brunch, I'd say that the selection of desserts was ridiculous... in a very good way. Plenty of cakes and pies to fill you up if the rest of the buffet didn't already fill you up. The dessert station also was filled with huge jars of candies: M&Ms packets, candy cane, packets of caramel popcorn, etc. I kid you not. If I had a kid, I'd make him/her stay away from this section. A child on sugar high: not a good idea. But if you love sweets, load yourself up on the dessert and sweets. And then head over to Nordstrom for some shopping while on sugar high. That was what I did.  Overall service was good and food was good. However this is not something I would do often because of the price. For $39.99 per person, only soft drinks are included but not coffee or tea. You can get brunch buffets in nearby hotels for a slightly cheaper price that comes with juice, coffee, and tea. But I guess Shaw's brunch buffet comes with oysters etc and the nearby hotels don't have seafood in their brunch buffets.

Might have been luck of the draw, and maybe the other servers are nicer. And maybe you'd have a better experience if you plan ahead to make reservations. Either way I don't appreciate judgmental service though.   My bf and I sat in the bar table area since we did not have reservations. The waiter was initially average. I am not a very high maintenance person, so usually even average service will buy you a good tip.  We don't drink, so just asked for water. The table next to us immediately ordered a number of drinks and appetizers. We could hear a totally different tone of the waiter with this couple. He returns to ask if want an appetizer, which we tell him to give us more time to look at the menu. He seems slightly ""eh"" and just walks away. Meanwhile still completely different tone to us versus table next to us. He returns for our order, which we order $100 worth of food. He immediate jokes with us a bit and his tone becomes more pleasant. He was fairly pleasant at the end  before our check, when he packaged our desert because we were too full. At the end of the night I handed him one of the Let Us entertain you scratch coupons for $15. Immediately his tone changes to being rather rude. He assumed I was going to stiff him I suppose, since I was using a coupon. He doesn't say much more to us and is rather cold. After I sign my credit card receipt, immediately he leads two ladies over to our table and hovers over our table before we even gather our belongings to push us out. He does not offer a ""thank you, have a good evening"", but purely only addresses the ladies he's trying to push into our table.  I am apalled by the way I was treated purely based on his judgement of me. I do not only eat at nice restaurants when I have a coupon, but if I have one, I have no shame in using it. I do not believe I am too good for it or low class if I use one. I have been to plenty of nice restaurants and have not been treated so rudely. I usually tip 20% and if i use any form of a coupon its prediscount that I tip. It was even hard leaving the guy 15%, which I still did because that was still  lower than I even normally tip.  Bottom line is I don't understand nice restaurants putting out a coupon if they assume people are suppose to be too good for them  And that anyone who uses them is going to stiff their server and never come back anyways. Why even put a coupon out. Also it bothers me that the way our system is set, encourages servers to gauge you to determine their level of service.  If they assume you fit a stereotype that will not tip well, they are absolutely different to you.

My dad, sister, bro and I had a last minute hankering for some good seafood... and what do you know, it was my birthday!  I was thinking more chinatown seafood, but my dad mentioned Shaw's and I definitely didn't complain. :) We made reservations and got there early, but were seated immediately.  Our waiter, Jason, was GREAT.  My family asked tons of questions and he was super patient, describing everything in detail and giving us a full and wonderful idea of how things would taste, what we would like, etc.  He left no stone unturned. We went with the oyster appetizer (a dozen) sampler to start.  My bro was all about the oysters, and my sis had never tried any before.  We each enjoyed the oysters, they were SO FRESH and DELICIOUS.  It was almost as if I had a really long snake-like tongue and stuck it into the ocean and ate the oysters straight out of the ocean.  YES.  That fresh.  Yum. I ended up ordering scallops, my dad the steamed crab, and my brother the lobster.  Since we all shared, my sis ordered the michigan sweet pea/bacon side and it was a perfect finish!... My scallops (I got the butter on the side, and didn't even USE it) were sooo delicious, I'd seriously recommend the sauce on the side, or no sauce at all.  They are perfect without it and it's just added fat.  My bro's lobster tasted great... but the belle of the ball was my dad's CRAB.   HOLY CRAB!  it was good. He had enough to share with all of us, and it was soooo meaty and delicious, and the crab legs were so easy to get meat from.  I hate it when you're picking out little slivers of meat from crab legs.  They were sooo fresh tasting, I think the best crab I've ever had. After we were all done, and despite our numerous requests and questions for our waiter, my dad complimented him on his amazing knowledge and service... then the waiter said ""I'll let you in on a little secret... you guys were my first table here!"" we were astonished!!  Great job Jason.  :)  and Shaw's.",0.999,0.675,0.279,0.046,0.6491452991452991

According to my tastes, I should really be rich. I love Shaw's.  I recommend eating your full meal elsewhere, for Chicago simply has too many other things to offer, but if you are ANYWHERE in the neighborhood for the half-priced oyster deal, you simply must drop by.   The staff is always knowledgeable and charming (sit at the oyster bar to guarantee this is the case) and the oysters are always satisfying on a million marvelously mystifying levels.  Humans have been eating these bad-boys since 500,000 BC for a reason, and it's not because they LOOK delicious.  It's because humans were really hungry, but that's beside the point. Despite my aforementioned inconveniently expensive taste, I don't like to spend $15 on a glass of wine.  Ever. If you want to be economical, you have no choice but to order a martini.  Or spring for the bottle of champagne, and pretend there's no tomorrow.  That's fun, too.

Inside, you'll find all the usual suspects, such as crab shell crackers at the table, various old school silver bowls and table clothes with crabs on them. I don't know when this restaurant was established, but it's safe to say that the menu has never changed. I had the oven roasted halibut with green beans. It was very good quality, but seriously, just that. There was no salt or seasoning. Someone just put a fish fillet in the oven with green beans and then just plated it.  Again, the quality of the food is not to be questioned, but it's deliverance is.

We had:  Spicy tuna roll - basic but delicious. The tuna was top notch.  Spicy shrimp and king crab - Awesome. How can you go wrong with a roll containing crab from a place with crab in its name!  Crunchy tuna and avocado: Again, amazing tuna and yummy green tempura flakes.  Acapulco Roll - This one contains cilantro (which I dont like) - but I tried it nevertheless and actually enjoyed it which means someone who likes cilantro would probably love it.  Chicago Crazy Roll - This was definitely the standout! Delicious mix of fish, amazing spicy sauce and a huge roll. Definitely something I will wish was on other sushi menus.  I also like the fact that the restaurant was split into two areas - one side was definitely more fine dining while the oyster bar side was laid back and not stuffy at all.

First, the tables are way too close together. It was pretty annoying to constantly be looking at a waiter's butt as they tended to the table next to us. Further, the people at the next table (about 3 feet away) arrived drunk, continued to be served alcohol, and proceeded to have a loud conversation about what they would like to do to each other in bed. They also enjoyed slurp-filled make out sessions. It was disgusting.  Second, the food was unremarkable. My husband thought his dish was okay, but I did not like mine at all. I had crab stuffed fish, which was really just a small piece of fish with some crab cake lumped on top. The crab tasted like it came out of a can. I've had better crab stuffed fish from our local grocery store seafood counter, and I live in Nebraska. Third, the food is way overpriced. I understand that it's Chicago, so everything is overpriced, but I don't mind pay more if I'm getting more. However, my less than mediocre dish was $35, and I couldn't even bear to finish it.  The fish tasted very fishy, sort of like it had been kept in a freezer for too long. It did not have the taste of fresh fish.    I really can't think of anything good to say about Shaw's. I would not return, and I do not recommend it to anyone else.

On this occasion, I was assigned along with an entourage of five other people to inspect a chocolate plant that supplies my company with chocolate (what else?).  Of course, most of the crew wanted to eat at a Chicago restaurant with a reputation to brag about to their co-workers.  Several places were nominated, Shaws on Hubbard won the election and was the place we were going to on that night. First thing you need to know about Shaw's, unless you are really familiar with the city, Shaw's can be very difficult to find.  It is just down the block from the Billy Goat Tavern and a level below the main drag.  While it is not literally ""underground"" like the Billy Goat, it is definitely in a hidden valley of sorts.  Easiest way to get there is to take a cab, let the driver worry about how to get there. Once inside, you could tell this was an old-school seafood place.  Dark wood, subdued lighting, linen on tables and waiters wearing white shirts and ties.  We went on a Monday night so it was not terribly busy, our waiter was very attentive and friendly and offered good suggestions from the menu.   I ordered the grilled alaskan halibut.  The rest in the group ordered grilled swordfish, fried lake perch, and some other dishes I can't recall.  We also ordered an appetizer platter of crab legs and a side dish of spinach and macaroni and cheese (everything here is ala cart).  I also ordered some Goose Island Honkers Ale which went very well with the crab legs and a lettuce wedge salad with blue cheese dressing. They first brought out a bread basket and the crab legs.  The bread basket included a very good pumpernickle and crisp flatbread.  The king crab legs were sawed into three inch segments and came with drawn butter and some horseradish sauce.  The crab legs were fresh and washed down well with the ale.  The lettuce wedge was made up with a fresh crisp wedge of lettuce, dressing, crumbled bleu cheese and bacon bits.  Again very good and fresh. The grilled alaskan halibut was mildly seasoned with cilantro butter and salt.  The fish was fresh and firm, the cilantro note complimented the fish rather than overpowered it,  The butter gave the dish a rich note which was absolutely delicious.  I did not partake in any of the sides or dessert, the bread, salad and fish was plenty for me. Shaw's Crab House was definitely old school, emphasizing quality ingredients and good food.  This is one Chicago institution worth going into the city for.",0.9924,0.856,0.119,0.025,0.4424385865457294

The roll was lightly buttered and grilled (they are made at a bakery in Highland Park? specifically for Shaw's), and the lobster was succulent claw meat. It was lightly dressed with mayo, a bit of lemon juice and parsley and that's it. Nothing more was needed to make this sandwich a home run.  It comes with fries which were pedestrian at best and we also ordered the blue crab and artichoke appetizer.

It was like butter.  Phenomenal!  Oh, and their famous crab cake? YUM.  I normally never order crab cake b/c restaurants will cheat you by using frozen crab, or they'll use the real stuff but will be stingy and fill it with bunch of crap fillers.  No thanks!  But wow, Shaw's did it right.  At first I thought 12.99 for ONE tiny crab cake was kind of crazy, but after tasting it, I wouldn't hesitate to order more in the future.   I was definitely impressed with their seafood, but it was a little on the pricier side, and I'm not sure I would pick this place over more affordable places like Bob Chinns and Reel Club.  Also, their steak was NOT good.  Everyone loves a little surf and turf so you've got to know how to cook a steak even if you are known for your seafood.  They definitely lost points for this. The service was great.  We came for my boyfriend's birthday and everyone treated us very nicely and wished him happy birthday.  The atmosphere is okay, it was a little too old school cigar lounge for me, but I had nothing bad to say about their seafood and that was what we were looking for, so it was overall quite good.

I'm like, OK.. do I have a ""Hi I'm From Out Of Town, Treat Me Like A Dick"" sticker on my back?   I'm like whatever..

The service at the Oyster Bar sitting at the bar was the best of the best. Props to Carlos the Bar Tender and the Man from Mexico City originally. This guys make the entire experience worth every dime. Best Clam Chowder ever. I use to thinks that this little place in Pismo Beach CA had the best but it just doesn't compare. The Oyster are wonderful and the Salmon I had was very good. Not as good as Elliott's in Seattle but close.  Now the main reason I came to this establishment. To see Morry Sochat & The Special 20's an incredible Blue's / Jazz band. These guys are great and if you're ever in Chi town and these guys are playing some where make the time to see them. If they are playing at the The Oyster Bar or Shaws Crab House one in the same but separated by name and dinning seating don't miss it. It's a double win great food, environment, the heart of Chicago and great live music.  Food is 4.5 the feel of the place and service 5 and the live musics is a 6 off the charts.

2009-06-11,5.0,"Another excellent evening provided by the Lettuce folks! And holy hell, how have I NEVER been here before last evening? Sad sad sad.  I am slacking in my old age. The next in a series of events, Shaw's held our biggest party of the summer and has done so for years from what I understand.  The staff remembers everyone in our group by name and without fail, keeps the event running smoothly from the time we booked it until the time we left the restaurant.   The buffet line was just about ready to go when we showed up 30 minutes before the event started- they were clearly on the ball and left us no reason to think anything would be rushed.  They also made sure to keep refilling our waters/sodas while we waited for the guests, and kept up conversation which is great- you HAVE to love a friendly staff at these events as opposed to the sometimes surly or just disinterested ones I've encountered elsewhere.  Throughout the night, I never noticed anyone waiting for a drink- they were SO on the ball.  Damn you Arturo and your never ending wine glass- I slept like CRAP last night.   Once the food was out- my oh my! Lots of pasta salads, delicious caprese, amazing alaskan halibut (melt in your mouth good) and fantastic sushi.  I kept going back for the eel and avocado, not caring who was judging me :) I didn't try the oysters (didn't feel like eating things that were just begging to make me look like an idiot by spilling on me :)) and I am not a fan of crab, but word was that the card legs were delish.  I never noticed any part of the buffet being empty so they must have been monitoring it well.  The little desserts were also really good- some brownies, a chocolate mousse in a glass sort of thing (I didn't try this, just was NOT hungry after all that sushi), little raspberry tarts (ok these were so small I found room for one and really wished I'd had more stomach space), and cupcake trees! So cute. They also opened up some champagne to pour with desserts.  Everything was just SO GOOD.   The event was held in the oyster bar and I can't recommend it highly enough.  The set up was really good for traffic flow (seems to fit 130 -150 no problem, and because they had the buffet set up along the far side of the bar, people HAD to move to get food instead of congregating by the door!).   Perfect staff, awesome food, excellent venue, 5 stars all the way!",0.9935,0.78,0.157,0.064,0.6035353535353536

We got the ""aphrodisiac for two"" which is mainly 'a bang for your buck.' I don't remember the specifics, but it's well worth it. You choose an app or salad, an entree and dessert. The food here is always good, so you really cannot go wrong. We still were a little hungry after so we got the kani roll, which was very good. Always great service here and a great atmosphere. Next, went for the Mother's Day brunch and I'm pretty sure it's the same every Sunday except for the rose for the momma's. Anyways, it was the best brunch buffet I've ever been to. Sushi, shrimp, crab legs, eggs, potatoes...what what what. I over-served myself. As I guess, I should have for $49.95 a person. The food was great and there was a ton to go around. The lines were short, the fish was very fresh and the Bloody's were....bloody. They had a nice spread for the mimosa and bloody bar, although it was unlcear that you had to pay for each drink. Our server gave us the impression that is what included on the price.  He gave us gold coins and said to bring those up when we got a drink....so wouldn't you think we were given those because we were doing the buffet? I'm seriously asking...

I'm sorry, I thought this is the same place people go in suits and dresses for really nice dinners? Oh, wait, there's a fine dining room over there, you can sit here and deal with terribly slow service and small portions for too much.  No I didn't order the crab legs. No lobster. I actually went there for sushi (perked my interest) but ended up passing up their $38 sushi platter which included 6 'small rolls' (I guess not full rolls?). So I figured, 'Okay, Shaw's Crab House, they have a lot of fish here too, oh look, fish tacos, I like fish tacos and I bet their really good here because it's Shaw's and Shaw's is supposed to be amazing.' So I ordered the $14 fish tacos. What I got was three deep fried fish balls on three small tortillas with a trio of bottled salsas and a cucumber slaw. Seriously, three balls sitting on tortillas. How is this fish tacos when I have fish meatballs? Disappointing. Didn't help that our server decided to take 20 minutes (I timed it) to return after we asked for a few minutes to decided after aforementioned sushi answer. I was trying to eat before work, but ended up walking out before my friends finished their meals. It's just unacceptable. I'm sure the finer dining place is great, the crab legs looked great, and I'm sure the sushi must be good or else they wouldn't offer it.

It was tough(even though it was rare), not juicy, and nothing I like in a steak. The crab legs were delicious, but we only got a few bites.  I was left very very hungry.  And our service was just 'ok'.   It would be nice if shaw's offered some seafood pasta options.

My aunt and I decided to have a nice lunch together today and decided to go to Shaw's.  I had never been to this place before but my aunt spoke highly of it.  It's pretty upscale and the professional crowd definitely are the majority in this restaurant but the service and the food was above and beyond my expectations. The only problem with Shaw's is the parking, if you go during dinner time you may find yourself in a bit of a pickle if you don't want to go via valet or a garage.  But during the time we went (around 1 pm) meter parking was easy and service was so fast we were only there for an hour. So my first impressions: 1.  The place was packed!  You wouldn't of thought so by just passing by the restaurant but it was!  A ton of people were having lunch. 2.  I loved the decor, very much of a sail boat/fishing feel, there was a huge atleast 8 foot model of a swordfish hanging on the main dining area wall, there were hooks, nets, and spears on the walls.  It was all done tastefully. 3.  I thought the portions looked pretty big. 4.  My only real complaint, some of the bread was super SALTY.  I'm not a fan of overly salty bread, but there was a selection of different ones, but eh half of them were salty. So the meal: DELICIOUS!  I opted to go with the daily special which I couldn't help myself it was alaskan king crab legs that came with your choice of a small ceasar salad or choice of the daily cup of soup.  And it also came with dessert, a mini key lime pie! The salad was really fresh and they dressing was flavorful.  The crab legs stuffed me, and I thought they wouldn't!  They were steamed to perfection and the butter served made the crab more succulent.  The key lime pie was great and perfectly cleansed my palate. I really like this place and would highly recommend it to anyone that had a craving for crab legs or seafood.

I'll admit, it was my second time at Shaw's, but my first time really letting loose and eating what this place is famous for - seafood!  On my first trip over a year ago I think I ate chicken or something boring. Since discovering sushi (on a separate occasion at a different restaurant) my days of only eating land-lubbing cuisine are over. So I had the fresh crab combo and my first oysters ever. The food is awesome and they even keep some their crabs live so they are very fresh. The chopped salad was surprisingly memorable for a salad as well. I recommend eating in the oyster bar as it seems much more fun than the dining room. We had live music, a lively atmosphere and Arturo the fantastic bartender - it was great! The restaurant is very pricey, but definitely worth it if you want to treat yourself. Don't waste your stomach's space on anything but their seafood!",0.9948,0.688,0.282,0.03,0.5365147198480531

For the entree, I got the lobster, brie, and penne (can you tell I like lobster?)  My sister got the seafood sampler (crabcake, scallops, and lobster), my mother jumbo lump crabcakes, and my father the crab-stuffed grouper.  My entree was very good - I wish there had been a little bit more lobster in there though.  I was kind of searching for more lobster when my bowl was getting empty.  But the cheese sauce was really great - real cheddar and brie, not Velveeta-ish.  Everyone else loved their meal.  I was too full for dessert, but my mom got a scoop of chocolate ice cream (which came out with fudge to pour over) and my sister got some of the green tea, which she said was decent.  I don't like key lime pie, but I hear Shaw's was recently voted best key lime pie in the city.

What can be more decadent than indulging in an oyster sampler, wine flight, and bloody marys for breakfast?!  We ordered the dozen chef's choice oyster sampler ($24.99).  It came with 2 of each: Fishers Island, Deer Creek, Moonstone, Flying Point, Wianno, and Courtin Island (the first 6 on the oyster menu).  I think it was the Deer Creek that I tried first and was taken aback for a few seconds.  I don't know if this particular variety is supposed to taste like that but it had a dash of funk.  The rest were better, from oceany to creamy to citrusy, but unfortunately that first one left a bad taste in my mouth. As soon as I saw the bloody mary, I had to order it.  It was colossal; stuffed with a giant shrimp, huge celery stalk, pickle spear, 2 olives, and lime... it left me stuffed.  The BM was mild, not too spicy or strong.  Some friends also enjoyed the oyster wine flight and a bowl of clam chowder.

The oysters are delicious, though not the best I've ever experienced (minus one star, Thomas Keller ruined oysters for me - but if you're going to be ruined for oysters, best to be ruined by him, no?)  The fancy side has fancy service, classy music, low voices and a big wine list. The casual side is jeans, CNN on tv, loud laugher and fizzy beers.

Tip #2 - Try the oysters.   Tip #3 - Try one of Shaw's martini's. A few complaints - Our oysters came out after the table beside us got theirs and they ordered theirs a good ten minutes after us.  I was not very happy, but once I tried the oysters my anger subsided.  Secondly the kid at the table beside us was annoying and would not stop kicking the bench, which quite a few of us shared. Tip #4 - Make your reservations for later in the evening.  I say 8pm.  It's a full house and pretty packed by then, but I think the kids will be gone and you will only have to deal with annoying adults by then.   All in all, Shaw's is a great restaurant.  Pricey, but once a year is worth it.  The best fresh seafood I have had in Chicago.",0.9959,0.785,0.168,0.047,0.5150919732441472

2007-10-06,4.0,"One of my favorites in Chicago.  Oysters are always fresh.  Martini is cold and have ice chips in them.  The key is top sit at the oyster bar side of the restaurant, and not the dining room, or you'll risk having a stuffy dinner next to some 630 and 847 tourists.   Our favorites are 4p.m.- 6 p.m. happy hour for oysters.  You can get a dozen for 1/2 the price, which is about $6.  If you go on Thursdays(and one other night), they have live blues and it makes the atmosphere really fun.  I frequently take out of town guests there because of its casual atmosphere, great service, and friendly Chicago crowd.  Bartenders(especially Arturo) are very friendly and makes sitting at the bar a treat! We always order 6 Fanny Bays and 6 Kumamoto's, and a couple of martini's to start.  Last night, crab cake with caesar salad and lobster bisque for me.  My boyfriend got the combo with a 6 oz filet mignon, scallops and prawn scampi.  We ended the meal with a slice of key lime pie.

2007-09-28,2.0,"Shaw's used to be located in Northbrook, where I grew up. Now I know why they left, and why my parents never took us kids there.... Too pricey to be in the burbs, and ultimately, I don't feel you get what you pay for here. For me, when you go to an expensive restaurant, you expect EVERYTHING to taste good, not just the things they are known for. I mean, how hard is it to make fresh seafood taste bad? Pretty hard. Oysters were really good, but very pricey. They also have a great wine selection, but that should be expected of a high end seafood place in the loop. I went with the Voss Sauv Blanc. I've had it before in Napa and it's terrific. The lobster bisque soup was the best thing I ate all night. But, I love lobster bisque soup, and have had better lobster bisque soup at Pete Miller's Steakhouse. My problem was the lobster dinner. The lobster itself was fine. But, it was accompanied by 2 tasteless steamed potatoes, a bland/discolored half piece of corn on the cob, and shredded Styrofoam they played off as coleslaw. I have had coleslaw a million times better at a bar when it's served with a burger and fries. Why the hell can't they do a decent job at a high end restaurant?!?  For me, when dining at an upscaled restaurant, I expect a complete meal. For the money spent, I expect there to be line cooks in the back who are innovators, not robots. For half the price, I can buy my own lobsters, crappy coleslaw in a bag, and mediocre produce at Jewel and make exactly what was presented to me at Shaw's.",0.9807,0.786,0.148,0.066,0.5442968749999999

First - this place will remind you of a little New England seafood place (okay, no seafood place out in those parts would have sushi on the menu, but this is Chicago, and that is why we are that much cooler...).  They have a a great menu that includes some great raw oysters (check out the daily half price special from 3-6, it's a real deal), lobster rolls, various fresh fish preparations, great clam chowder, fantastic sushi (especially the spicy shrimp and crab roll)and a KILLER Mai Tai...and trust me, since Trader Vic's has closed down, I am picky about a Mai Tai. The feel of this place is casual, which is great considering the incredible food you can get, plus you can order off of the dining room menu if you wish, and all of their desserts are made in house - especially mouth watering is the pecan pie, the raspberry pie, and the peppermint ice cream with fresh hot fudge. I have been going here for about 4 years, and I consistently see the same busboys and servers  - and I think that says something good about the restaurant (hey, they must be nice people to work for) - this is a surefire win whenever people are visiting from out of town, something for all and a guaranteed great meal!",0.9965,0.714,0.251,0.035,0.5641838800929709

The swordfish was a bit overcooked though it was accompanied by a tasty sauce and veggies perfectly al dente.  I finished off with creme brulee. The custard was mushy not smooth and the entire dessert was ice cold which was surprising. I think the temperature limited the flavors making this dessert fall flat on the palate.

That said, the lobster bisque was good, and the seafood portions in the seafood salad are generous.  ---------------------------------------------- I have eaten from Shaw's twice with different results.  Last night got it delivered to my office and while the bread was yummy, the blackened tilapia with red beans and rice was only mediocre and not delivered hot (and I don't work far from there).  But last time when I picked up from there for lunch I had the lobster roll (fabulous!) and the seafood salad (also good).  I will definitely eat from there again, I would just choose carefully what I order, and eat there or pick it up.",0.9771,0.841,0.132,0.027,0.5870370370370369
