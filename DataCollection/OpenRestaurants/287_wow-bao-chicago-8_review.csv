Saw this place around town and had decent enough reviews - I tend to aim for 3.5+ star reviews. I spent $35 on baos, buns, rice bowls, and potstickers.  BBQ bao was okay. Definitely didn't really taste like any regular Asian BBQ pork. Thai curry bun, I opened it and that was enough. It smelled so bad and strong, I took one small bite and just about gagged.  The open pork buns were also not good. The vegetables had some sort of odor and taste that just didn't seem right.  Teriyaki bowl, one bite was enough. Ginger was way too strong. The fried rice was so soggy and the pork was way overcooked and dry.  The potstickers were the only thing that was decent.  Basically I didn't finish my food and threw the rest out of taking a few bites to eat somewhere else.

2016-07-30,3.0,"To be honest early on in the review, the only reason I'm not giving Wow Bao 5 stars is because of how terrible their staff was at Lollapalooza. My boyfriend and I were amongst some of the later show goers and we left early to get food before leaving the park. All of the food tents were still open and operating, we were *totally* ok with skipping them all to head straight to Wow Bao's tent. After standing in line for about a minute, the guy in the lame hipster glasses turned us down saying they'd just made their final sale. This makes us feel awesome when there's literally NO one behind us, and they still have MULTIPLE boxes of food sitting behind the booth within clear eyeshot. Not insulting at the slightest. The best part was when a guy working the booth came up to the hipster glasses bro and asked why they were closing. Clearly he had the same reasoning as us - aka - we still have a crap ton of food, already made, and sitting out... why aren't we serving people? Oh - I know why! Because the workers were lazy and tired of dealing with people. The girl in the back in the braid was a total, eh hem, brat... yelling, ""Yea we're closed!!!"" K gurl, we get it.

2016-06-28,1.0,"Well, I received a negative message from Erika K.  of Wow Bao who would rather condone her staff's lack of urgency and lack of basic customer service skills. First of all Erika, you weren't there that day and no, I didnt catch your staff at a bad time. I was one of 4 customers at 7:30 in the morning, so I doubt your staff was swamped by a breakfast rush. Second, why would you excuse anything less than good or even basic customer service? Seems to me, we found out who the real culprit is.  I believe it starts with you. So you're ok with your staff not greeting customers? You're ok with your staff not saying thank you?  You're ok with slow service when it's not even busy and the food is already prepared? You're ok with staff complaining about their job in front of customers? Well, based on your message to me, I guess your answer would be yes. If that's the case, you might want to get additional training for yourself or think about another line of work. You're probably going to edit your response to me to make me look like the bad guy, but dont worry, I've already saved your original and perhaps your senior executive team might want to read what one of their representatives had to say when he simply pointed out service was lacking. Remain in denial all you want, but that kind of attitude won't  win you any new customers nor help you to hold on to the ones you barely have.",0.7026,0.785,0.125,0.09,0.4164592352092353

The bowls are hit or miss (do NOT order a veggie bowl; you'll end up with rice and what looks like the leftover veg bits at the bottom of a freezer veggies bag) and generally underwhelming, and the dumplings are basically what you get when you buy freezer case chinese dumplings. The dumpling soup is pretty good -- I like the herb broth, and you get a ton of noodles and dumplings for pretty cheap ($4.50?).  Service is quick and everyone is nice, so I have no complaints there.

I love opened faced buns (the kind that looks like a taco) and I also love steamed bao. The fillings are pretty nontraditional (mongolian beef, or pumpkin) but I opted for the more traditional bbq pork, and also a pork belly open faced bun. The ordering system is pretty nice, where can either you order first outside the store on iPad-esque kiosks, or go up to the register. I opted for the robo-version and it was easy and painless. They were definitely well steamed, and came piping hot, soft and spongy. However, I felt like the interior stuffing was kind of mushy and flavorless, and my open faced bum was just a greasy mess. The steam buns I felt like I could have gotten the exact same thing from the frozen bun aisle of the Chinese supermarket. The plus side however was that everything was very cheap. Overall, a pretty tasty, cheap, and filling snack, but I wouldn't come here if you had high expectations for the quality of the bao.",0.9928,0.75,0.235,0.015,0.5672222222222223
2015-10-21,4.0,"I've always wanted to open up my own bao shop.  It's the perfect snack: filling, cheap and easy to eat.   The set-up is very casual and quick as most of the items are pre-made (baos, buns, potstickers), allowing customers to place an order and then stuff their faces in a matter of seconds.  The baos are like small round sandwiches with whatever filling you want in the middle, surrounded by pillowy steamed bread.  Sure, there were dessert flavors like pumpkin but I knew I wanted to try my beloved bbq pork.  The baos were pretty cheap, running about a buck and some change but because I'm such a pork belly whore, I knew I had to get the pork bun as well ($3 something).  The bun is slightly different in that it resembles a mini taco but still made with the soft steamed bun.  In it are some slices of pork, a sweet hoisin sauce and some other creamy sauce, cilantro and pickled vegetables.  I would say it does cater to the younger generation more because both items were a tad on the sweet side, but not enough for me to not enjoy it. I personally would rather the items have a little spice to them over sweet, but that's just me.   Another quick note, this place has other items too, like rice bowls and salad.  In fact, to all my friends out there who also aren't a big fan of traditional American breakfast items, they have a breakfast option which includes: a breakfast bao, rice bowl and fruit for 10 bucks.  #Bao4Life",0.9802,0.803,0.155,0.042,0.5521885521885522

First off, we were in the mood for savory items, so my partner took 2 baos and coffee deal, and I got a rice bowl and iced Thai coffee. We were having it 'for here' and took a seat. As we were starving, our ears were acutely tuned to listening for our number to be called, as the girl was calling all the order numbers.  Then something strange, our number was skipped, and we thought maybe the to-go people got their first since they need to get going. We waited another 5 minutes, until my bf went up to see what was the issue. I was at the table watching all our items, and then all I hear is the girl yelling at him about how they had to throw away the food because nobody picked it up.  Whaaaaat??? And then all I hear is her yelling the entire time about how we should have come up sooner, and totally blaming us. About 4 minutes later, my bf comes back with our order. I take a few bites and I had egg shells somehow mixed into the eggs, and they didn't give him the coffee that came with his meal. Highly disappointing, as I was looking forward to this meal, and having my bf yelled at certainly did not help. Also, if you're in the food industry and see that the order is for here, then you can also check to see where the people are if they didn't hear you whispering the one number for the people eating in.

2015-04-01,4.0,"The Last Supper. No, not da Vinci's world famous painting. For me, this last supper was special because it was the last dinner I had with my Dad. He passed away 6 months ago and this was actually one of the last things we did together. One thing you need to understand is that my Da had really specific dietary restrictions towards the end of his life. He had radiation for throat cancer a couple times and it left him unable to eat anything that wasn't basically soft and/or mushy. That's not exactly something appealing to me on a regular basis, and it's surprisingly hard to find on most menus. So the stress of having to cater to that on top of him being a grouchy old guy made most meals with him on the verge of being completely unbearable. I was about ready to kill him toward the end of his short visit here. Enter Wow Bao. Wow Bao was a godsend when we needed it the most. Wow Bao was located about half a mile from the Bank of America Theatre, where we headed to see a show afterward. Wow Bao was affordable, so he didn't bitch about the price, even though I was paying. They also had enough options to please him without offering so many choices that it would be overwhelming or allow him to linger on making a decision, something that had often been an issue. We ended up splitting a Six Pack of bao in Teriyaki Chicken, 2 BBQ Pork, Spicy Mongolian Beef, Coconut Custard, and one that seems to be a special - Banana Chocolate. Above all else, the most important thing about our dinner together is that the Teriyaki Chicken and BBQ Pork bao, along with their Hibiscus Lemonade, was the perfect consistency and spice level for my Dad to manage. He was able to taste the fillings and loved them, especially the Banana Chocolate dessert bao. In fact, he was so excited to be able to eat somewhat normally for once in years that his skeletal frame skittered back to the counter to get seconds and he stuffed himself silly. So what is Wow Bao like for someone without so many requirements? Fantastic! I loved everything we ordered and I loved sharing that meal and moment with my father. Even the spiciest of bao wasn't offensive to my tame Minnesotan palate. I like that the paper wrappers tell you what each one is so there's no surprises. I particularly like how nice the employees had been on that day, and the other times I've visited alone... *sniff sniff* Honestly, the only thing I don't like about this location is that their hours are limited, but that's to be expected in this area.",0.986,0.839,0.128,0.032,0.5527565654684298

2014-09-12,2.0,"Maybe I'm missing something, but I just don't get it. My girlfriend and I paid another visit to the City of Chicago earlier today. We were walking around the Loop looking for a place to eat and stumbled across Wow Bao right around 12:30 pm. We looked inside, saw how busy and popular the place seemed, and decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately, we left scratching our heads and with three-quarters of our food uneaten. We ordered a little bit of everything, as we were both rather hungry. My girlfriend ordered a Teriyaki bowl with Jasmine Rice with 2 Bao on the side, while I got an order of their potstickers. We also both got a cup of their ""homemade ginger ale."" Overall, this food proved to be rather expensive at $10/person - I understand that this is the Loop and food is going to be on the pricey side, but I would have been able to handle the cost better if the food had been more delicious. While the service was fine (neither good nor bad), the food itself was unappetizing, bland, and simply confusing. The Teriyaki seemed like it came out of a can: the chicken was too finely chopped, the sauce was far too sweet, and there were way too many green onions covering this dish. My potstickers were done enough, but were completely tasteless and far too oily.  The Bao themselves I simply don't understand - doughy, almost gummy, weirdly sweet, and the filling we got was more of the teriyaki (with the same problems the Teriyaki bowl had). Furthermore, the Bao came in some sort of wax paper wrapper that stuck to the bottom and had to be peeled off; I understand the need to label what filling is in what pastry, but is there some way this could be done that would be slightly more appetizing?  Finally, the homemade ginger ale was far too strong; both my girlfriend and myself took one sip and reacted as though we had drank a glass full of black pepper. I understand that perhaps this beverage is something of an acquired taste, but a taste that strong seems as though it would be rather hard to acquire. Overall, this meal was expensive and my girlfriend and I left hungry. The food was disappointing at every turn, and the namesake food item left me scratching my head. I would not eat here again on my own volition, and yet, I am forced to wonder about Wow Bao itself. I had a meal sampling a wide range of items on their menu and I was disappointed across the board. However, the place was packed to the rafters full of diners who presumably enjoyed their food, the same (or similar food) that I had just eaten and not enjoyed. Therefore, I ask the Yelp community as a whole: what am I missing here? Did I order the wrong thing? Did I come at the wrong time? Or am I just a complete and total philistine?

2014-05-02,4.0,"Much like Peirogi Heaven, this is a lunch joint. I guess it's a chain since there is more than 1. But I'm not sure I would exactly call this chain food. It is sort of mass produced but then again, they have a few things on the menu. Well, I guess they have 1 thing on the menu that you go here for: steam buns. While I'm not going to say I think you should go to Chicago to eat here, I will say I wish there were 1 of these in NYC. I don't remember what I got but ordering was easy. Walk up to the screen, pick what you want, pay, and you get a number. Inside of 5 minutes they put your order together and you can walk out the door. Simple, easy, fast. Gotta love that. I took the buns back to the hotel which was a 20 minute bike ride south to McCormick Place. So maybe they were not as piping hot as they could have been. But I let them slide on this as I was the one who chose to not eat them right away. I don't remember exactly what I got but it was something like Kung Pao (2), curry, Mongolian beef, something else, and chocolate. I liked them all, but loved the curry and the chocolate. Man, these were awesome. I think the KP and Mongol buns were good but not really spicy as claimed, and not really so much different. Curry was my favorite. And the chocolate was an awesome finish to the six pack. I'm sure this lunch was way more food than I should have been eating but I'm on a pseudo vacation and I'll very possibly never eat here again. So what the heck, I went for the sixer and enjoyed myself. I have to say I was definitely not disappointed. I'd eat here again for sure if the opportunity presented itself.

For about a $1.80 you can order one bao, but I think there is a combo deal for 6 of them. I don't remember the price as I was kinda in a hurry (I just finished an interview and needed to head back home for business). I picked up 4 bao: 1 spicy Kung pao chicken, a spicy Mongolian beef, a coconut, and Apple bao.  I like spicy strong flavors and I didn't know if I would like the fluffy steamed bun texture so I wanted something that could overpower it.  The ""dessert"" bao were amazing. My husband loved the apple (I didn't eat it because there was cinnamon on it and I'm not a fan) and the coconut bao blew my mind. The creamy sweet texture with coconut pudding and flakes and the soft steamed bun together..... TO DIE FOR!  The two spicy flavors my husband and I split to try them both out and holy gods they were so good too!! The bun itself surprised me in flavor, it was basically just a stuffed roll kind of taste. Very airy and light and not overly ""bread"" tasting. The flavors of the fillings would have definitely shined on their own even if I didn't get the spicy stuff I bet.  The guy working the cash register gave me and my friend free apple ones since they were out of chocolate (the whole reason we stopped by, my friend said they were legendary good). So I thought it was really sweet of him to give us the apple ones ""on the house"" since we were kinda sad over not getting chocolate.  I'll definitely be back to see if they have chocolate next time and I really want more of the coconut!!! Plus the meat buns we got were fantastic and pot stickers are by far one of my favorite snack meals so I can't wait to go back and try everything!

2013-10-03,2.0,"HOT ASIAN BUNS I asked the cashier what was better the buns or pot stickers and he said, ""This place is called Boa and not Pot Sticker for a reason!"" So I ordered the pot stickers. No I'm just kidding I ordered the Bao, which are the hot Asian Buns.  Now this cashier guy was putting a lot of pressure on these hot Asian buns to be delicious. In fact, I've been to Asia and I've had the real deal. So lets see how these buns stand up at an American Fast Food joint.  I ordered two Bao: a spicy Mongolian beef & a BBQ pork! According to the worker behind the counter I picked his first & third favorite. So that made me excited. One thing I didn't like was that my hot Asian buns were in the same basket & I didn't know which one was which flavor. So I bit in and had no idea what I was eating. The flavor did not pop at me. I had no idea what it was. So I decided to take a bite out of the second one. Again it wasn't a flavor explosion but I could sense a little BBQ taste, so this had to be the BBQ pork. It was not good that I couldn't tell what the two different meats were. I will say that the Bao were a 1 Star experience. I would never order these again.  What I was really excited about was the bowl of spicy kung pao chicken over lo mein noodles. The flavor of the chicken was really good. I also liked that the chicken seemed to be ground instead of the traditional chunks. This had the right amount of spicy. One thing I didn't like was when I mixed up my bowl there wasn't enough of the Kung Pao Chicken to cover my noodles. I kind of like my noodles coated in sauce. I got the feeling that this place measures out portions & servings. I would give the flavor 5 stars and 2 stars on the amount of sauce.  Also the bowl was very tiny for the amount paid. It was not a good value.  This place had add-ons too. With a bowl you are able to add on 2 Bao or 3 Pot Stickers for $2.75 I do know that if I ever come back here then I'm going pot stickers instead of buns.  And if the pot stickers are good, then I will call this place WOW POT.  The more I think about this place it makes me want to never come back. For example, I paid $10 for food here and I left hungry but for $7.75 I can get a giant bowl at Chipolte and make two meals out of it. So when at look at value & portions this place is not a good deal.  Also the address on Yelp says 175 W Jackson but its actually located on the other side of the building by Jefferson. If you walk in off of Jackson then be prepared to walk across the building to find this place.  I did not have much staff interaction. The cashier who took my order was nice and helpful. I would give him 5 stars for customer service.  The guy I picked my food up from seemed grumpy and he didn't really talk except for calling out my pickup number.   So would I come back? Probably not.  There signature hot buns were not that great. Unfortunately for this place I've had the real deal, so I had something to compare them too. The bowls were small with limited sauce topping. The flavors were good but it wasn't filling.  I really didn't feel like I got my money's worth.

The curry is not too spicy so even those who normally cannot handle spicy things can eat it. I think they use a coconut based curry gravy.

I entered the store and was greeted with the familiar view of the steaming bamboo things for the bao.  I ordered a traditional bbq pork bun, a Mongolian beef bun, and a coconut custard bun.  About a minute later I was handed a bag with all three inside.  Each one was within a smaller plastic bag that was labelled, which was nice as I did not want to eat dessert before my meat buns. I started with the pork bun.  It was pretty good, but a little too fatty.  The flavor was delicious and the bun was nice and chewy.  The Mongolian beef was nice and spicy with a healthy portion of beef for a little bun.  Then I got to the coconut custard, not a traditional bao by any stretch.  It tasted like a coconut cream pie. I would have given this place 5 stars if they had two changes.  +1 star for less fatty meat in the bbq pork bun.  +1 star if they included a red-bean (azuki bean) paste or black bean paste bun as a dessert ( en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sw… )",0.9806,0.847,0.141,0.012,0.5952380952380952

2012-09-28,3.0,"The only reason to come to wow bao is to try a bao. Duh! I'm not the biggest fan of them but definitely get the spicy mongolian beef bao, its the better tasting one.  I stay away from the thai curry one and have no desire to try the coconut custard or chocolate one. I guess I'm not a fan of the spongy sort of dough that they steam. One thing I am the biggest fan of is pot stickers so maybe if the baos were pan fried and not steamed I would like them more but thats not their gimmick. The rest of the menu is on point from the pot stickers to the noodles to the rice bowls.  I would recommend the pot stickers, terriyaki rice bowl and spicy peanut noodles. The restaurant itself is fast foodish, line moved fast and prices are what you expect to pay downtown for fast food.  My only props aside from the food is I noticed they were playing Gang Starr when I went to the restroom.

2012-09-20,3.0,"Wao Bao is unique in a way that it isn't a traditional Asian bao that you would get from say Chinatown. Traditional would be a bao filled with this Asian meat & vegetable combo, but here at Wao Bao you can get stuffings such as teriyaki chicken, spicy kung pao chicken, whole wheat edamame, thai curry chicken, spicy mongolian beef & bbq pork. I went for their lunch combo deal which was 2 bao's & a side. I opted to get the Thai salad since it sounded refreshing and a spicy kung pao chicken bao and a spicy mongolian beef bao. The total came out to about $8, and for a lunch meal, it was okay. The outside was fluffy, and the stuffings were flavorful. Both were a bit on the salty side, but they encased both flavors of kung pao chicken and mongolian beef.  One gripe I have is how small the bao's are for what you pay. I feel two is really just an appetizer, and I'm 150lbs so I don't gorge on food, but 2 hours after eating my stomach was grumbling again as if I had just had dim sum. If I were to have gotten more though, I really don't think it's worth the price you pay.

It definitely takes a few trips for you to try everything and then figure out what your go to meal is.

I passed Wow Bao on my way to State Street and quickly decided that I would eat there on my way back to Union Station because I absolutely love bao, but I can never find anywhere to get any where I live. So, I made my way back after shopping and was pleasantly surprised by the decor and line format. I was a little nervous because it seemed as though the place is popular with the locals and I was nervous that I wouldn't have enough time to look through the menu before being nudged into line by impatient regular customers. Thankfully, they also have efficient touch-screen ordering. I was able to see the menu very clearly and the entire transaction took less than a minute. I was given a number and it was called in under 10 minutes. I got a spicy Mongolian beef bao, a teriyaki chicken bao, a chicken curry bao, and a glass of pomegranate ginger ale. Everything was absolutely delicious. In fact, it was all so delicious, that I decided that I was going to get the pumpkin bao, coconut custard bao, and another teriyaki chicken for the next leg of my train ride. The bao were nice, hot, and extremely tender. The dough had just the right amount of sweetness to it, the filling had no gristly bits and was extremely flavorful. The ginger ale had an excellent amount of bite... you can tell that it was made from real ginger and it is easily known upon first sip that this is homemade stuff that you cannot get this quality of ginger ale from the store. Out of all the bao I tried, I think that it would be safe to say that you can't go wrong with any of the flavors. I'll just go in my corner and sulk because there isn't a Wow Bao outside of Chicago. Maybe one day when I'm really craving bao, I'll see how much it costs to ship 'em over to me.",0.9957,0.803,0.168,0.029,0.598999248614633

I can't believe it took me this long to eat at a Wao Bao. With a large menu of salads, rice bowls, and bao dumplings, it surely won't take long for my return. Wanting to try everything at once, I ordered the Rice Bowl + 2 Bao special. The Kung Pao Chicken over jasmine rice was spicy (George likes his Kung Pao spicy!) and tasty, but the small bits of dark meat chicken were difficult to locate and could be improved with bigger chunks of white meat. I tried the BBQ bao and the Coconut Curry bao. Both were excellent, and the dumplings were much softer than I imagined they'd be. The coconut curry was more like dessert! Wao Bao makes their own ginger ale to order so I ordered the Original. It was spicy and sweet.  This was way too much food and got kind of pricey for lunch. But I'll order appropriately next time!

The fillings are pan-Asian, which is usually a recipe for disaster. The Teriyaki Chicken, Thai Chicken Curry, and Mongolian Beef barely resemble the dishes they were modeled after. The ingredients are minced with unbalanced amounts of cilantro and/or ginger. What's worse is that Wow Bao also offer rice bowls which are just bowls of white rice topped with these meaty monstrosities! The only saving grace at Woa Bao is their ginger ale, made from real ginger. It's got a real zing to it.",0.6351,0.784,0.133,0.083,0.55

It's good for its original concept:  relatively inexpensive, pretty yummy quick lunch food.  I had the combo with two baos and a side.  I think this combo was $5.99, and it was very filling.  You may also get this combo with potstickers instead of the baos. I asked the cashier what the most popular order for the combo was, and she said a teriyaki chicken bao, a bbq pork bao, and the spicy peanut noodles.  I really enjoyed the bbq pork bao, and I'm typically the type of person who really does not like steamed dumplings (I prefer pan-fried).  The bbq pork had a good amount of flavor.  I can't tell you exactly what it was, but it was good and I was hungry.  I put a little of the red chili sauce they keep on the tables on it, which was also delicious.  The teriyaki chicken bao was a bit too sweet for me - I will likely opt for the spicy mongolian beef bao the next time I go.  The spicy peanut noodles were about a cup and a half of plain noodles with cilantro and about two ounces of peanut sauce.  The sauce had just the right amount of heat.  I'm glad they put the sauce on the side - two ounces was about twice as much as I needed. My fiance had the chicken potstickers.  They were pretty standard, but the mustard sauce that came with it was very tasty.  It was a thinned out chinese mustard with cilantro - very, very good.

I should've gone with my gut and played it safe once I'd read the menu; the veggie choices are uninspiring. Here's an example: Bao choices: Teriyaki Chicken Spicy Kung Pao Chicken Thai Curry Chicken Spicy Mongolian Beef BBQ Pork Whole Wheat Edamame The sole veggie bao seems like a complete after thought. I was hoping that the description didn't do it justice, but just as it sounds the veggie bao is about as exciting as eating a rice cake - and that was the highlight of my meal. By the way whatever bao you get they are tiny; I've had bigger cupcakes! I also ordered the 5-piece green vegetable potstickers, which were so awful I only could stomach 3. I was never asked if I wanted my potstickers pan-seared or steamed or what sauce I would like with them. The sauce they chose was fine, but the texture of the potstickers killed it for me. They were chewy with some crunchy bits, potsticker was sticking to my teeth the way some hard candy does - gross! I couldn't tell if they were pan-seared AND steamed, over-seared or what, but ick! I couldn't even tell what the green vegetables inside were, one was possibly spinach. I saw that they have homemade ginger ale and decided to take a glass to go. It was ok, but not what I was expecting. It's heavy on the ginger, more like a ginger beer, than ale (yes, there is a difference).

2009-01-17,2.0,"I think I'm running out of GOOD locations to eat lunch in my section of the Loop - because even though I'd been here before and knew it would be horrible, I decided to visit Wow Bao again just to get a fresh batch of fodder with which I could write a full review. I went with my usual (if three visits total ordering pretty much the same thing counts as 'usual') order of the bao 6-pack.  Two chicken teriyaki, two mongolian beef, and two bbq pork.  I like cramming as many different animals into a meal as possible.  The last time I was here, I also went with a 5-pack order of pork/cabbage potstickers. To be honest, I liked the taste of the potstickers.  I ate in, which meant I had access to their sauces available on the table.  My only issue was paying 80 cents per piece, as a 5-pack is $3.99.  Even purchasing overpriced potstickers frozen in a grocery store is a much better deal.  Find the cheaper potstickers in the frozen section, or visit a local Chinese market and you'll find GREAT deals.  These 'stickers may have been tasty, but not mouth-wateringly delicious enough to warrant the price. Likewise with the bao.  Well, just the complaint about the price - $7.99 for a 6-pack, which means they're each $1.33 without tax.  And the bao aren't even tasty, so you're pretty much throwing away money.  What you will find in the box they hand you are little doughy lumps that pretty much look like something pumped out of a Play-Doh Factory. That's right, Play-Doh.  And someone's even put up a picture of a bao already - look at the little design on the top.  That is in NO way representative of somebody crimping up the sides of dough around the pocket of filling.  That is completely representative of this thing being extruded from a machine like a white lump of Play-Doh. For further proof, bite into one without eating any of the filling (which is quite easy to do as they each have very little filling) and you'll be reminded slightly of EATING Play-Doh (if you've ever eaten Play-Doh before *looks embarrassed* you'll be reminded even more than if you're just imagining the comparison). Then maybe you'll get to the filling and you'll notice the rather-blandness.  The mongolian beef is nothing like a real Mongolian Beef you would eat in any standard Chinese restaurant or even crappy Chinese buffet.  The bbq pork is abysmal and make me shed a tear that I had not spent this money in Chinatown where a REAL BBQ Pork Bun costs almost half the price of this Play-Doh facsimile and is three times as big and a hundred times tastier.  The teriyaki chicken filling was actually decent, though when you consider that I had to pay $7.99 for approximately TWO TABLESPOONS' worth of tastiness, you can see why my overall rating of this place is two-stars. The only way I could recommend this place is if you are deathly allergic to entering a REAL Chinese restaurant, cooking REAL Chinese food from frozen bags, and have been BANNED from Chinatown.  If that's the case, then you will have no comparison point and you can freely enjoy your expensive Play-Doh Bao without remorse.  Since I fall under neither of those categories, I expect it will be a long time before I make the mistake of entering this place again.",0.9791,0.837,0.108,0.055,0.47148711943793914

So I yelped it and read all the good reviews so I decided to try the one closest to my hotel in the loop area. i'm soooooo not use to restaurants closing sooo early but i guess if its located in downtown where most of the clientèle are business people working 9-5, you kind of have to close early. anyway, luckily i got here right before it closed and ordered my combo with one bbq pork bao, edamame bao and cold pad thai salad with hibiscus tea which totaled to a bit over $8. which isn't too bad considering the cost of meals in the downtown area anyway (besides the $5 footlongs at subway, which is like at every corner of this city! lol). i read alot about the excessive use of ginger in their recipes on yelp, but honestly the flavor was just right for me. especially the bbq pork bao. now.....i grew up having authentic chinese cha sao bao (bbq pork buns), and i must say.....this was a bbq pork bao that i would put on the top of my list of baos. it was extremely flavorful, not just a fistful of bbq pork stuffed in a bun! you can definitely taste the ginger and the spices in the bbq pork. it was very very good! the edamame....well, i'm a bit of a health nut, i love anything that is healthy for me, and even though this was the first crushed edamame bao i've ever had, i would have to say i enjoyed every bite of it. the salad...well, this i could have done without, it was a bit plain and didn't have much flavor to it. even after adding a bi of the vinaigrette which was nothing but oil, vinegar and ginger. perhaps i should have tried the spicy peanut salad instead. the hibiscus tea was perfect becuz it was naturally sweeten...none of that sugary crap.  oh and btw, the restaurant was very nice and clean. i love that they have the chinese version of the coke machines which actually says ""coke"" in chinese! brings me back memories of taiwan.... =) oh ya...and no it's not on Jackson as the address indicates. if you're from out of town, i suggest you read up on the directions from others. its actually on the corner of Van Buren and Financial.",0.9965,0.833,0.144,0.023,0.5242526455026456

The food is extremely fresh - they start preparing ingredients at 5 or 6 am everyday, and even the sauces are made from scratch in-house). I think this place sets a good standard for the future concept of fast food - fresh, healthy and mindful, but inexpensive and served up quickly. Even my own mother seems to think that the bao (steamed buns with sweet or savory fillings) at Wow Bao are better than the ones that she's been making for years on passed family recipes and stacked bamboo steamers (mostly impressed by the texture - very soft, fluffy and chewy).  If you aren't accustomed to the concept of a bao, then it's worth a try...they are only about a buck fifty each and nothing too far out and crazy (I might describe them as little Asian White Castles).  Also - the recipe for the veggie bao, to my knowledge, was altered a while back and now suits a vegan diet.    Apart from the bao, they also have a noodle/rice bowls, potstickers and a pretty different and tasty salad selection.  Really a great place for a lunch spot, in my opinion.  It also has a clean and pleasing interior, and they play good music.",0.9967,0.738,0.244,0.019,0.5758333333333333

2007-07-19,5.0,"IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO USE WORDS TO DO JUSTICE TO MY LOVE OF WOW BAO!  i am so glad they are opening other locations!!  last night i ventured over to the financial district wow bao -- treked down jackson from state in the hideous pre-lightening storm humidity -- to see the new(er) restaurant. it's AMAZING! it's large and airy, and we got to talk to the owner (gush, would be a more appropriate verb).  i have admittedly never been to china, japan, or anywhere in asia. my only experience with ""real"" bao is in san francisco's china town. HOWEVER, they didn't compare to wow bao at all. and no, i'm not afraid of bean curd, or anything like that. i'm extremely adventurous culinarily and i do appreciate me some red beans and also macha. however, i found that the ""real"" bao lacked flavor in both the bun anbd the filling (and considering that some real chinese bao [in china] were recently found to contain cardboard... they possibly also lacked safety?). i actually gave two of the four bao i ordered at one place in china town to a homeless person. that would never happen at wow bao.  but back to the wonders of the wow bao itself. my favourite are the thai curry and the bbq pork, but i think i've tried all of them at some point or another. if i could eat two thai curry and a bbq pork (which is what my gf always sweetly buys me) every single day for lunch, i would.  fun: there is an apple bao coming out, and a coconut custard... we were lobbying for peanut butter and jelly, and he actually said they are working on it. i will be at the financial street waiting for my apple bao as soon as they come. as far as the legitimacy of asian fusion food -- remarked upon by another yelper -- i just don't see the problem. and i'm a historian and certainly not a patriot, by trade so i'm not being ignorant about weltpolitik -- i just think it's unrealistic to expect every ethnic restaurant to maintain an ""authenticity"" of a place in which it does not exist. there is no wow bao in china -- wow bao IS distinctly american (american does not always equal bad or tarnished), and wow bao effing rocks.",0.9961,0.827,0.159,0.014,0.5280335097001765
2007-07-17,4.0,"Serenity. Efficiency. Flavor.  Those are three things that come to mind when I think of this place. Here is why:  Asian cuisine restaurant that serves the Financial District with such speed and exactness it is mind-blowing. I have never had to wait for my food for more than 5 minutes and never have they forgotten to put anything in my order (wish the same could be said for crappy places like McDonalds and Burger King where the employees take joy in forgetting to add that slice of cheese you paid $.60 cents for to your sandwich).  The food here is pretty much already pre-packaged into combos. I always get the pot-sticker, peanut sauce noodles meal for like $6. You get 5 pot-stickers with some cold noodles that you add a spicy peanut sauce too. I love this dish so much, I rarely stray into trying others, although I know the others are just as delicious!  Lastly, the serenity of it all.... this place is spic-and-span clean, shiny, bright lighting, perfect. It belongs in the movie ""Fight Club"" as a perfect example of corporate evolution. The employees don't have a stain on their white clothing, nothing is out of place. It can be noon, busiest time of day and somehow, I still feel serene here, as if everyone there was working in tandem, employees and customers alike. It is quite weird.  They also have ginger and pomegranate ginger ale drinks, which are made fresh right there.  Many things to choose from, decent pricing and speediness if you're in a hurry. Only complaint is that the rice bowls, don't have much of the chicken or steak or whatever, otherwise I'd give this place, 5 stars!",0.9856,0.825,0.141,0.034,0.5408588435374149

I think maybe the BBQ pork, Mongolian Beef, Edamame whole wheat.  That whole wheat one is a great idea and it seems really healthy with the veggies in there...no extra saucy goo either.  But, although I still like it I feel like I could LOVE it if it had a little more flavor. 3) Peanut noodles.  Spicy.  Good! 4) Pad Thai Salad - eh, allright 5) Wonton soup - eh, boring.  Pretty bland.  One handy note: I've often had the combos or gotten two baos and I always ended that meal thinking, ""dang, those are so good.  I could eat 100 more.""  So one day I just got 4 baos for lunch, nothing else.  Maybe it's because I walked it way back to my office so they sat around...I dunno...but I felt like the 4th bao was too much.  I took a bite and was like,""ehhh, I don't want this!!""  So, maybe the threshold for a normal person is three baos?

2007-05-15,4.0,"UPDATE 6/1/07: I am GREATLY PLEASED to report that Wow Bao in the Loop has replaced their heavy plastic to-go packaging with significantly less earth-impacting paper containers.  Upgraded to FOUR STARS!!  I don't know if my letter to LEY had anything to do with this, but I'm happy nonetheless!  Of course the best solution would be permanent dinnerware but I realize that this isn't always a viable option for fast-food business lunch locations. C'mon, add some more veggie options and earn those FIVE STARS!!! ORIGINAL REVIEW 5/15/07:  Following a recent trip to NYC where I sampled some super awesome dumplings (@ Rikshaw), I was really excited when I heard that Wow Bao would be opening a Loop location... with dumplings!  And the veggie dumplings are really tasty, as are the whole wheat edamame bao (albeit made with chicken broth - why?).  I only wish they provided more veggie options.   However, my big beef with this store is their excessive packaging!  Their eat-in food is delivered in the same format as those taking their food to go.  Specifically, the dumplings are served in an oversize, heavy plastic container.  When I inquired, I was told that the store would not be recycling these.   So I wrote their parent company Lettuce Entertain You a note regarding their packaging and suggested some cheaper and more environmentally friendly alternatives. On the flip side, I did commend them for their non-use of containers for individual bao. There is minimal use of materials, just a couple small pieces of thin paper.  There are a growing number of people who patronize only restaurants with the smallest eco-footprint and food packaging plays a large part in this decision-making process. Minimized packaging and a wider variety of veggie options would turn this 3 into a 5.   ps. Dumplings rule!",0.9964,0.779,0.199,0.022,0.5915130568356374

I was even expecting maybe cashew chicken somewhere on the menu. I was wrong, it was kung pao chicken. But I was right, it's really over-priced for what you get comparatively. It's not that expensive overall, but I'm used to paying $3.00 for what I got here for $7.00 The buns themselves tasted sort of close to the fresh steamed bread my grandpa used to make but not nearly as good. The buns have take-out fare in them rather than the stuff you'd find in a Chinatown dim-sum. BUT they were still delicious. The salads weren't that great, but I've always been turned off by noodles/rice that are cold; the texture is just all wrong. The salads were also really vinegary. I don't expect vinegar in my pad thai or peanut noodles so I don't understand why they put so much in them.  It still kind of bugs me that something that's only $0.50 in a Chinese bakery or any place with decent dim-sum is $1.29.

It contains wide rice noodles, I believe, with mixed greens and crushed peanuts on top with this really great vinaigrette type sauce and the teriyaki chicken bao are my favorite.

For fast food, Wow Bao has a pretty unique offering.  There's a good amount of asian inspired noodle & rice dishes as well as soups.  Their trademark is the ""bao"" which is a soft dough ball with meat packed in.   They also have a home-made gingerale which is refreshing. Wow Bao loses 1 star for the most confusing menu in the world.  There's 3 lines when you come in.  The menu is divided into 6 sections and with different options for each section.  No pictures means you have no idea if what you order is a ""full lunch"" size.  I'd penalize two starts for this, if it weren't for a good number of extremely friendly employees that explain the system to you, then take your order before you reach the register.",0.9894,0.684,0.248,0.068,0.5875

[end of bad joke] This is the answer to having a bao without having to go to dim sum or Chinatown. As a Loop Lunch Location, what it doesn't have in terms of being a perfect bao reproduction, it makes up for in convenience and accessibility. The baos are not oversized, and are reasonably priced. You can get 6 for a shade over $7.50.I particularly like the BBQ Pork and Mongolian Beef baos. I also recently tried the whole wheat vegetable bao which was also tasty. My addiction to the bao has prevented me from trying anything else on the menu besides the hot and sour broth, which did nothing for me. This location has seating, and it should be possible to snag seats until the weather gets nicer, and more people outside of the financial district learn of this place's existence. Since this location of the restaurant is relatively new, you will potentially encounter slightly slower than normal lines due to new workers or Loop Lunchers examining the menu for the first time. Ideally an order runner will have taken your order by the time you get to the register.

2007-03-01,4.0,"I thought my lunch was superior to most other choices in the loop, so Wow Bao deserves four stars. I had the chicken dumpling soup, which was hot, fresh, and tasty. I didn't think it was too salty, and the dumplings had a robust flavor considering the somewhat blander broth.   I also had one bao, the thai chicken curry. It reminded me of an Armenian meat beoreg (delicious if you've never tried!), but with a little different seasoning. There wasn't much filling and the dough is kind of odd (extremely puffy and airy when you bite into it, yet they feel dense). I like the strangeness and the fact that it is is somewhat healthy (if you don't eat the salads, oddly enough) Another plus is that my lunch was under $6.  The owners were in the store today, and I asked him what inspired him. He just said his travels to Shangai and the surrounding area are what led him to help open Wow Bao. I was expecting something a little more exciting.  Definitely try it!

I'm a big fan of their Water Tower location so when I found out there was going to be a second shop opening not more than 2 blocks from the office my Baometer starting humming.  The concept is identical to their other location. Steamed buns called Bao are stuffed with Chinese and Thai mixtures like curry chicken, mongolian beef and kung pao chicken. Priced at $1.29 a piece they're quite a deal for the flavor and consistent quality they offer.  I got the two bao combo which gives your choice of three salads (pad thai, spicy peanut noodle or eight vegetable) and any two bao. I opted for the spicy noodle and then a bbq pork bao and a mongolian beef bao. The salad was a cold soba noodle mix with chopped chicken as well as a really tasty, pretty spicy peanut sauce. There were sliced cucumbers for decoration and to complete the whole thing. For $5.49 I was blown away, it was really delicious and WAY worth the price.  Service was a little slow but as the manager told me they had only been open for 20 minutes so today was their first live dry run. I'm sure the small kinks I experienced, mainly the speed of service and the fact that I waited for five minutes while they replenished the noodle salad supply, will be ironed out  Definitely hit up Wow Bao, it's the best bang for your buck in the area and you won't be disappointed.",0.9862,0.869,0.131,0.0,0.5623015873015873
