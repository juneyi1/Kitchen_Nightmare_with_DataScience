2009-12-27,1.0,"Charming Bleech is more like it.    Wait.  Let me be fair.  The phone staff was somewhat charming.  However, the food is nearly repulsive- especially the egg rolls.  They are the very worst I have ever eaten.  They are exceptionally bland and heavily canola-oily-ed and stuffed only with flavorless finely shredded, very greasy cabbage.  Too expensive ($43.00 for two entires, a smalll fried rice and two orders of egg rolls).  And the*free"" pot stickers?  Oh god help me but I swear there was a cat turd in one of the pizza dough-y chunks. Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeew! We ordered last evening for a birthday dinner.  It was just gross.",0.189,0.82,0.107,0.073,0.6466666666666666
2009-04-02,3.0,"I agree that it is overpriced, but the food was pretty good. The Mongolian beef had a good flavor as did the beef chow fun. The wife didn't like the Shrimp in Garlic Sauce, or the pot stickers. I thought the flavor of the pot-stickers was very good, definitely unique. They gave us 8 pot stickers, usually you only get 6. We both agreed the egg rolls could use some work. They aren't the thicker kind, more of a deep fried spring roll. Overall decent, but the price was a turn off. Our total was $43 for three entrees, and the pot stickers and egg rolls. Delivery was super fast, ~25 minutes.",0.9829,0.702,0.251,0.047,0.6195833333333334
2009-01-21,1.0,This place is horrible. The food did not taste good and it over priced. Two entrees (that were not tasty) came to around $23 bucks. I will never order from this place again.,-0.7101,0.836,0.0,0.164,0.8
