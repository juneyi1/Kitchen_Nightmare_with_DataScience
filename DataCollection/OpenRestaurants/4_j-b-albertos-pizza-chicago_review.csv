Only thing I will say is don't get the chicken on the pizza. They don't season it or anything. It's literally shredded chicken that has been boiled.

I've heard several stories from local natives who grew up nearby, and they all agree that it is always timely, affordable, piping hot, and delivered by a dedicated crew who know how to please a party of 10 of your friends with a single pizza in one fell swoop of a mouse click! Check out my photo if you don't believe the hype!  The 24-inch-round, yes, you read that right! - 24-inch pizza arrived at my door in the same amount time it would take to deliver a medium, and after my initial shock of seeing that giant box come out of the delivery driver's hot-bag all I could say was WOW. You can even get a few liters of soda pop to go with it, just as I did! Don't hold back, because if you're going to break the calorie rules - be sure to break them right and proper!   Normally I'd say stay hungry my friends, but with a pizza this big, there's no way you will! Oh! And pro tip: Take a slice the day after, spray some no-stick spray on the bottom, throw it in the frying pan, and have yourself a slice of fried-pizza heaven the next day. My oh my!

I mean it's not that hard to read a ticket that says allergy use fresh cheese. I work in the food industry and my boss would be so pissed if we kept doing this. But tonight was the final straw I have a medical condition where I get sick a lot and can only eat certain food and a baked potato is on of them. And jbs is the only place that has it. So tonight I place my same order and once again they screw it up. I talk to a manager and he agrees since after screwing it up so much he would discount half the order and send a new potato. And he said it would be here in 10 mins.... 30 mins past no potato which is my dinner. The driver finally gets here 45 mins later after my partner had finished his dinner otherwise his would have been cold when we were just trying to have a nice dinner together. Over 20 times this place has fucked up the same order for me. That to me is crazy. I will never order from here again.

No seriously, I work super long hours so when I'm exhausted and need to order out after my long day plus commute, I opt to order something I can utilize into other meals. Chicken rocks my world because it can be used in Frittatas , a scramble, a sandwich chunked or made into chicken salad. Add it to a rice bake or pasta!! It's endless. SO my point is that JB Alberto's creates such a fresh hot fried chicken box that suffices all my lasting weekly meals.  This chicken is so flavorful and cooked to perfection. Always delivered hot to my door to satisfy my immediate hunger. I opt for the 12 piece to last me thru my next few days. JB's can rival flavor to any name brand out there. I am always impressed and very thankful.  I do recommend when u get that craving or need a longer term solution in this still hot weather.  * if only they had biscuits!!! I could write reviews all day in honor of JB Albertos'   Just had a simple thin crust sausage pizza delivered this Halloween night...it was per usual hot juicy cheesy perfection.

Update: First time I experienced a bad pizza and I was so crushed!! JB is usually very consistent but the 14 inch Veggie I had ordered on a Wednesday evening was horrid!  Inside the box I assume used to be a circular shape , but instead was morphed into a partially folded semi circle. The cheese and toppings slid a quarter of way off of there intended resting area AND the pizza itself was cut ridiculously. There were giant 6 inch pieces on one side and still Attached smaller cuts on the opposite side.  (We had been working fixing up , repairing and cleaning our apartment for a straight eight hours , so we were starving and ate our so called dinner as is , ) BUT This pizza , aside from the monstrous display staring from its cardboard border, was also extremely bland.  We had to add salt and extra Parmesan for flavor enhancement . So I am not certain what happened that evening but the disappointment still lingers.

2016-07-13,5.0,"This is the second time I'll be claiming a ""best"" of my pizza reviews, but JB Alberto's has the best stuffed pizza in Chicago. For those of you who do not know what ""stuffed"" is, no it is NOT like Pizza Hut's stuffed crust. It is like deep dish with a twist. This is one thin layer of crust, followed by a ton of cheese and toppings, another thin layer of crust, then topped with sauce. I digress. There are many things that make JB's different, yet amazing.  For starters, it is open later (2 AM) on the weekends. Second, their quality of by-the-slice is just as good as anything made to order. The diversity of pizza styles and toppings is a great selection.  Now for my most recent experience. I've had JB's on several occassions, and every time it is as if I've taste pizza for the first time. The stuffed pizza is executed so perfectly, my friends and I compare it to the craftsmanship of a sushi chef. The flavors and smoothness of the bite is almost melt-in-your-mouth delicious (if that is even possible with pizza). The most shocking thing about JB's stuffed pizza is how clean it is. Most deep dish/stuffed pizza you have sauce everywhere. Not here. It's like the sauce is baked on to the top. Impossible to describe, but it makes for an amazing dining experience.  I know people who ""hate"" this type of pizza (I know, don't get me started) but love this. I think it's because of its balance of not too much of anything; the sauce, the crust, the toppings, the cheese, and even the seasonings.

For us, that really makes the crust stellar.  We have also tried the thin crust and the deep dish with the deep dish being more positively memorable.  Sometimes the pizza takes longer than the delivery time stated but we have never been delivered a lukewarm or cold pie.  Also, we have had issues on occasion with employees taking our orders over the phone; it's hit or miss if they get everything correct.  The food is the most important though and it for sure satisfies Chris and me (hungry hungry hippos).  Will definitely keep ordering from them! xoxo",0.9802,0.815,0.175,0.011,0.5313131313131314
2015-02-23,5.0,"When I think of the pizza of my childhood in Chicago and its surroundings, I think of a slightly more crackery thin but not too thin crust, a touch of sweet sauce with basil and oregano notes, and mozzarella cheese. Most importantly, it's cut in squares, or the Chicago party crust. This is JB's pizza. JB's is a Rogers park institution that does every style of pizza great. Top three for deep dish, my favorite for thin, and if you want one thin crust stacked on top of another thin crust pizza, this is your place. Plus, if you have a couple hungry friends, you can get a 24"" pizza and a free RC Cola. In fact, the RC comes with all pizzas.  Plus there's so many more menu options.

In that time I have tried nearly every pizza place in a reasonable distance from my place in Rogers Park, and while I still haven't found a place that makes an authentic New York style pizza that I can really say anything other than ""That wasn't too bad,"" about, I have slowly learned to appreciate good Chicago style pizza. JB Alberto's is GOOD Chicago style pizza. My wife and I order from there several times a month, and the service is always friendly, the delivery times very fast, and the quality of the pizza is always top-notch. I've read some people complaining about the softness of the dough on the deep dish pie, but I am a fan of it. It's never undercooked, it's always soft and yielding, yet firm, and holds the ingredients well. They are generous with the toppings, there is always an abundant amount of REAL cheese, and the sauce is a nice robust tomato based sauce, not the overly sweet, sugary stuff that passes for sauce in those chain places. Oh, and here's another thing they do at Alberto's: they put the toppings on TOP of the cheese. Seems like a no brainer, doesn't it, what with them being called toppings and all? But I've found it generally isn't the case around here. Nothing compares to the crispness and browning on the edges of pepperoni slices when cooked on top of a pizza as they are supposed to be.

The ravioli was equally delicious and the salad was covered in a mountain of sliced cucumber, cherry tomatoes and peppers.

They did forget my peppers but I was still charged for them. The meat did not have enough flavor and it tasted very bland. It was dipped in the juices but the flavor was still the same. The peppers could have helped with the taste. I did mention the price was reasonable but I was disappointed in JB's a la carte pricing. It costs $0.30 for peppers, $0.50 for onions, $1.00 for cheese, and $0.75 for bacon. You would think peppers would be included with an Italian beef sandwich.  Here are some more items I tried within the last four months. I keep notes of the food I try because reviews are useful if people are partial and unbiased.  Load Fries-It costs $3.50 plus taxes. The fries include cheese, bacon, and sour cream on the side. The fries were okay but the cheese reminded me of the cheese high schools served with nachos. Lol. You could taste it wasn't a good quality cheese and JB was stingy with the bacon. It's probably perfect for college students.  Cheeseburger Deluxe-The cheeseburger with fries was good for the price. It costs $4.95 plus tax. My only complaint with JB is that they tell you 30 minutes for every order. Of course, it doesn't take 30 minutes.  Rib tips-JB always give you lots of food but the rib tips were not good at all. You could tell the meat wasn't good quality. The sauce did not help because the meat wasn't good. I do not recommend the rib tips but everyone's palate is different.  Pizza-I have J.B. Albertos pizza all the time. Their pizza is very good for the price and they give you a lot of pizza. I have only tried sausage, peperoni, and deluxe pizzas. The cheese and sauce is very good. And a one liter pop is included. A card is included with the pizza and if you collect 20 of them then you get a free 14 inch one topping pizza.  Coupon-If you shop at Dominicks then keep your receipt because sometimes it has $2 off of $15 or more on the back. I will post a picture of the receipt when I get one.

Okay, not really, but I said I was going to 'yelp the hell' out of J.B.A. and Philly girls don't lie. Last night I was ummmmmm, munching, and with two lads under my rooftop, I knew two things: 1, I wasn't cooking; and 2,  dinner needed to get to arrive quickly and be delicious.  In the category of 'most well-rounded restaurant with delivery service' in our area, they win. I've had better pizza (Connie's hands down) but I love their food, all of it and with all my heart. This 5-star rating comes because of the awesome customer SERVICE JBA has constantly provided me, the consumer. As buyers, we have the choice of going anywhere we want to eat. It's Rogers Park - we have both a plethora of spots to hit while never knowing what to eat at the same damn time. But even the girls are friendly! Okay, so last night, John (I believe.....as previously implied, I was kiting) was SO on point, so wonderfully human with just the right amount of convo and business, so knowledgeable about his place of employment that I had to let the fucking world know.  I'm big on service. I am not snotty or high-strung with it. For the most part, I am understanding. But when something is so stellar, especially when it doesn't have to be, I become a fan.

The online ordering tool is great and the food comes pretty quickly for the most part.  I can't seem to get them to read their online orders very well though.  A few weeks back, I ordered two eggplant parm dinners one with meat sauce and without.  The web makes this so clear but they still sent me both with marinara only.  why give choices if you are not going to grant them?  More importantly is the notion of ""extra"" sauce which no matter how many times I check the box and write it under the comments fails to appear.  The eggplant parm with spaghetti always comes too dry (I don't want to see the white of the pasta - ever).  I've had to add my own sauce on occasion which kind of defeats the purpose. I think they have changed chefs over the years as the sauce is different.  It is still good but it used to have chunks of garlic in it and once in awhile, they would add green pepper to the recipe ; much more robust and flavorful versus today.   The value for the dollar however can't be beat and the quality is still there so I won't be changing anytime soon and do recommend it to others.  I do wish they would get back to their original recipes and read their online orders better though.",0.9688,0.829,0.113,0.058,0.45928620928620933

So I was thinking I will let it go and just order again. But then I decided no not again $20 after tip is too much, So I called today to see what the manager would say after relating the story to him of how things went, he had a huge attitude, and argued with me, saying the driver was back ontime and why did I not call right away last night, basically just denying there is a problem with JB' Alberto's which there is after batting .500 thats not acceptable for me. Well after more arguing he gives me the old the best I can do is give you $5 off your next order. Total BS I'm done. No more there about a million better Pizza joints In RP alone.

I venture here much too often.  It's a very short walk from my apartment, and it's open pretty late, which is great, as I usually get home from work pretty late.  PROS: Their stuffed pizza is delicious. I actually like it more than Giordano's a few blocks away, and it's cheaper.   Their french fries! I love the thick- cut fries they have, a friend of mine gets them extra-well done to help with the chance of them getting soggy on the walk back to my apartment. Mmm. Their coleslaw! Super cheap! Super delicious! It could stand to be a tad creamier (at times it can verge on watery) but it's always tasty. I often get a couple when I get takeout so I can have one for later. Their barbecued beef sandwich, oh my god, I love it. Their sauce is delicious, the price is right, and it gave me dinner + lunch the next day.  The fried chicken. They have a special on it once a week that makes it a dollar cheaper than it's already cheap menu price, plus it includes coleslaw, french fries and some of their torpedo bread (personal preference: changing the bread to garlic bread.) They have pizza slices that you can grab on the go, which is convenient. If you order a pizza, you get a free liter of RC.

2011-08-20,3.0,"We have [tried to] order from J B Alberto's twice. The first time was a good experience, but the second was disappointing, and also a bit upsetting. There are qualities to their deep dish pizza that recommend it. The crust is crisp across the bottom and edges, and almost fluffy inside. We added fresh garlic, and I guess I should have mentioned that we like LOTS of garlic, but it was a fine enough amount scattered atop. The large order of breadsticks is 6 pieces, and might be a little overpriced for the quantity. Generally though, the food is reasonably priced, portions are large, and the delivery time was shorter than the estimate, which was a plus. Their online ordering for our first time was swift and easy, and we were surprised that the 14"" pizza (serves four, or two for two meals---leftover pizza....) came with a free RC cola. The second time, I found it a little difficult to customize, and decided to call instead. My hope was to order the deep pan pizza without red sauce, substituted instead with olive oil or some other lighter (blanca) option. When I asked for this, I was abruptly told ""We don't have any olive oil."" I asked, then, what the young man I was speaking to would recommend instead. Getting ruder, he told me that the red sauce was the only sauce that came on that pizza. I told him we didn't want red sauce, and would like to come up with an alternative, or I'd have to order from somewhere else.  He laughed derisively and said that I could do what I wanted. I paused, a little shocked at the lack of helpful customer service, and eventually said that I guess we'd have to go elsewhere, since he didn't seem willing to help come up with the right pizza for us.  The food was very good for our first experience, and I was happy to bring additional business to them.

2011-03-20,4.0,"For starters, I have to say that J.B. Albertos is the best thin-crust pizza I've ever had and I see no point in ever ordering from anywhere else. The crust is the PERFECT thickness and texture and the cheese just billows; yet, it doesn't mask the sauce. I've heard some say it's too salty, but I've experienced this is only on occasion. Thought I haven't tried it, I'm betting the deep dish is heavenly. On the other hand, I recently tried the stuffed pizza and was very disappointed. I have lived in the Chicago area for 14 years and have cycled through many a pie. In all my years of living I'd never thought I 'd say ""this is too much cheese"" Alas, I have met my match. Not only are the toppings lost in the lava of mozzarella, the crust is smothered to nothingness. The tops of the crust that IS visible, is burnt and undesirable, though useful for scooping up a pool of cheese now and then. If you do attempt to conquer the cheese typhoon, I suggest a double decker, extra dough, LESS CHEESE and 3 toppings minimum.  I have no complaints about customer service. I've had bad experiences and I've had decent; I won't put anything in front of the thin crusted heaven.",0.1967,0.767,0.114,0.119,0.5394736842105262
