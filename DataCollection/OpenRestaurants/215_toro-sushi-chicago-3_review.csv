2017-07-27,5.0,"Toro is absolutely the best sushi in Chicago.  The quality of the fish is just far better than anywhere else, and they also have sooo many rolls that are filled with lots of fishies and other good stuffs. I sat here eating today thinking about where they get their fish and confused why it's so much better than everywhere else in Chi.  The service here is kinda weird (quick but not super personable), the restaurant is kinda grungy, but the sushi makes up for it x10000.  I highly recommend the Chirashi Bowl, it's a great bang for your buck and all of the fish melts in your mouth. We also got the kamikaze & holla hollapeno and both were really good. The kamikaze had sunflower seeds and maybe macadamia nuts? But it was super crunchy and yummy, but just beware that it's only four rolls!  If you come before 6pm on a weekday it's super easy to get in! The only thing I hate about Toro is that they don't deliver, and aren't on any delivery apps either, so the only way to get it is to go there :(",0.5349,0.742,0.137,0.122,0.7249305555555555

My friend and I decided to try Toro Sushi because of good reviews, but were disappointed from the moment we walked in. We arrived a little after 5:30, and we sat at the front left table facing the window against the wall. There were just 2 other people sitting at the sushi bar, so we beat the rush. Our server asked if we were ready to order although we just sat down and I told her we needed time. We never saw her again.  I opened my menu and saw some of the dirtiest stains ever. Both of our paper menus had brown stains (on the INSIDE of the plastic) and were grimy. A new table had sat behind us and received some of their food and we still didn't see our server. While we waited for over 10 minutes for our server to come back, I noticed a musty smell from the wall on my left and my friend told me we should leave because he was completely grossed out. We got up and walked out. The chef called for the server and pointed at us, but we were already out the door. I left confused and sad.

Toro is BYOB, so there's your wine right there. But Toro doesn't subject their fish to butter, thank goodness. Mitch is Toro. Toro is Mitch. He is the owner who welcomes each customer with a warm fist bump and who reigns supreme as Master of his Realm.  Mitch knows fish like Einstein knew physics. He sees things in fish that others miss. And he has very exacting standards when buying his fish. After talking to him, I see how 95% of a good sushi restaurant happens in the buying of the fish before it even gets to the restaurant. You see this in movies like Jiro Dreams of Sushi. But Toro isn't fancy. In fact, the restaurant is a a bit shabby, but in a warm, comfortable way. You don't come here for the decor. You come for the fish and to kibitz with Mitch.  Rolls stand out here. Our favorites are the Trixie, Miami, and Three Musketeers. Sushi is wonderful and the sashimi is outstanding.  Tip: Mitch will grate real wasabi for you if you ask (for a small charge).

They gave us the completely incorrect order and when we called back to inform them, they lied and said they called to tell us they were out of all the fish we ordered. However, when we went to pick up the order, we waited 10 minutes and spoke with the host and he never once mentioned it as he kept updating us on the status of the order. Mistakes are absolutely fine, and excused, when a restaurant will take responsibility and make an effort to remedy the situation.  Instead, the host was extremely rude and abrasive when we asked if we could come back and get the food we ordered or order something else if they were, in fact, out of ""all salmon and scallops,"" as he alleged.

I prefer to sit at the sushi bar because you can hang with Mitch, the owner, and watch him and the rest of the staff make sushi. The sushi in my opinion is the freshest in the city. You can keep it simple with the sashimi/nigiri (because the sushi does not require heavy sauces like other restaurants) or have your pick of just about 30 (or more) different sushi rolls with any combination of ingredients. My favorites are the kamikaze hand roll, Ahi salad roll, and the salmon lovers roll but I have probably had all of the rolls at this point and I have never been disappointed! Would highly recommend this spot of you want incredibly fresh sushi with a variety of choices!",0.9789,0.833,0.159,0.009,0.5036554621848739

However, Toro seems to be the most popular  and always has a line that goes out the door (probably mostly due to the small space inside). Been here two or three times before to dine-in and food has always been good. Came here recently to order food to take-out on a Friday night. and even then, the wait was 45 minutes. Got three rolls to share between two people: 1- El Fuego - definitely the favorite of the three. Includes jalapeno which gives it a nice refreshing kick.  2- Kamikaze - recommended by the host, but I wasn't impressed. It includes a bunch of various types of fish diced up covered in a spicy volcano sauce. However, because there was so much sauce, it masked the taste of the fish and whatever else was in the roll.  3-Best of Both Worlds - Love the fresh slices of fish on the top. It was one of the bigger rolls, but nothing special. Food was good, but not sure if it is worth the wait during peak hours especially when there are other options just down the street that are comparable.",0.9421,0.819,0.134,0.047,0.5895502645502645

They're a small BYOB (no hard liquor) place and do to go orders. Definitely a busy place. That said they don't wear incomplete parties but the staff don't cut the quality service as a trade off (they're super knowledgable and personable).  Had an agedashi tofu, they hit the broth just right (I've seen places that add sugar...). Crazy horse roll, which was a server recommendation blast of flavor and fish (the cilantro was a nice touch). Salmon, Boston, and A SPICY TUNA. As you can see very traditional roll choices that highlight their quality...but I need to rave that they make real spicy tuna that isn't detracted in flavor with mayo, their sesame chili oil base won my heart as it reminds me of my home sushi place in Orlando (see Orlando--Sushi Tomi).

Salmon was good both times. The prices are very reasonable, particularly for nigiri, the pieces of fish are very generous and about twice the amount of rice. However, the fish quality is average.  The service: 2/5. The service was friendly the second time when the place was dead, but the first time we were asked to leave because we were finished eating, even though we were still drinking our sake. The place also has a very strong musty smell I can't get over.  Overall: 3/5. Reasonable prices and decent service if you're not too picky about the fish quality.

To their credit, Toro identified it as escolar, as opposed to lying about it (""white tuna"").  What's wrong with escolar?  Much - the fatty esters aren't digestible, causing GI symptoms including gas and diarrhea.  Not ""toxic,"" but pretty unpleasant.  Also has an odd, soft sharky texture.

My boyfriend and I ordered the El Fuego, Yum Yum Yummy and Octopus Nigiri.  The El Fuego had a really lovely balance of spice that was complemented by the cilantro - not something I'd typically expect in a tuna sushi roll but it worked. The Yum Yum Yummy was exactly as described - portion seemed on the smaller size. The food itself was well done, fresh and tasty.  The issue I had with the whole experience was an order (not ours) was messed up - a waitress was working to resolve the issue with the chef and he started loudly yelling at her in front of all the guests.  I understand the food industry isn't exactly calm but if you're going to have an issue with your staff do it in the back.",0.9408,0.844,0.125,0.031,0.5118055555555555

In fairness, Sushi Toro is more of a 3.5 than a 3, but I rounded down partially because of the 4 star rating, and the fact I had some issues with the place. The main issue was that the rolls would fall apart. This is Sushi Making 101. You have to make the rolls tight enough so they aren't loose and fall apart. That's just fundamentals for a sushi chef.  I was really hung up on the roll-making, and maybe I'm overly critical but having worked at a sushi restaurant and recognizing the art of sushi rolling, it was hard to say with a straight face that this is one of the city's best sushi restaurants when their rolls were falling apart.  That being said, some of the rolls were tasty. The Sunny roll was the best, and the spider and caterpillar were ok.  I can't recommend this place but I'm willing to try it again. Maybe it was just a bad night for the sushi chef, or there were new sushi chefs early in their career that night. Since so many of my friends like this place I'm sure I'll be back.

The sunflower seeds sound so random for a sushi roll but are actually awesome and completely make the roll. The HOLLA HOLLAPENO and KAMIKAZE are also great. The latter combines so many different kinds of fish - tuna, yellowtail, white tuna, salmon, etc - that it sounds scary but it somehow comes together deliciously !!

My boyfriend and I arrived around 6:45 on a Sundayand didn't have any wait to sit at the bar.  We ordered the Red Dragon, Southern Galz and Kamikaze rolls. By far the best sushi I've ever had. Each were obviously amazing but if I had to pick a favorite it would have to be the Kamikaze. I liked that rolls were topped with a copious amount of the delicious filling. However, the crunch from the frying of the Southern Galz roll made it a close second.   In terms of portion, we came hungry and were definitely full when we left. We probably could have just ordered two rolls and left satisfied (but really, no regrets).  I can't wait to go back and try more of what Toro has to offer!",0.9721,0.822,0.158,0.02,0.4264705882352941

It's BYOB but they're is a store close by to pick something up. Also no cork fee which is nice. A couple must try rolls are the OMG and the kamikaze. Both are very different from rolls I've had anywhere else. Also it's a very small place and none of my stars go for the ambiance as its tight inside but the sushi makes it very worth it.

2015-09-30,3.0,"I wish I could give like a 3 plus, but I can't, and it's not a 4, so....  I had good memories of this place from visits  2-3 years ago.  Since then, I have been to several other good sushi places, and I often found myself comparing them to Toro, or, more accurately, the memory of Toro.  I finally visited again a few days ago, and I was disappointed, because Toro didn't come near to meeting what my memory had built it up to be.   First, the ambiance is basic, generic, plain.  Neither adds nor detracts, except some of the tables are very close to each other.  Second, the service was o.k.  Took awhile to get seated in a two-thirds empty restaurant.  Pleasant.  No check-in after our food came.   Third, and most importantly, the food just wasn't what it has been built up to be.  Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, but it's above average at best.  The menu is predominantly rolls, about half of which are contrived/trying to hard.  A roll with blue cheese in it?  I'm all for creative, but it still has to make a little bit of sense.  The quality of the ingredients was solid but unspectacular.  I really could not find a reason to come here instead of 10-15 other places.   Toro isn't bad, but it's nowhere near to what it's been built up to be.  Only way I can see myself going back would be if I just happened to be on that block when a hunger for sushi happened to strike me and I was just too lazy to go for something I really wanted.",0.9701,0.784,0.141,0.075,0.4398083623693379

2015-07-24,5.0,"Toro Sushi has been my sushi place to go for the past 5 years. When I first moved to Lincoln Park, I wondered what the big rush was all about. And soon, I found out why. I have tried sushi in many places/cities around the country, and can say Toro is probably on my ""Top 5"" list, compared to some of the best in Seattle and California Bay.  Mitch is very personable, and I can say has focused on customer satisfaction for the time he has run this place. The fish is fresh, and the rice is just right - two things making for a perfect storm for great sushi. Like other Lincoln Park establishments, this is a BYOB. On the negative - there is a big wait if you go at prime time. The best time to try this place is Friday or Saturday for lunch (it is closed on other days for lunch). Since they don't take reservations, you better plan to get there early for dinner. (Tip - if you don't get a spot, Sushi Mon down the street is a great alternative). Given the size of the restaurant, it can be packed and loud, but feels very lively. Hence, not a good spot for first dates unless you are both adventurous foodies who like lively places.",0.9811,0.812,0.164,0.024,0.4570840681951793

Sushi rice was fine and we liked the amount of fish in the roll. I think the escolar made me a bit nauseous after the meal but if you don't mind the trade off for buttery fish, I especially recommend that roll. The soft shell crab in Big Tex tasted delicious too - well portioned, crispy, and was not overpowered by unagi sauce.  My salmon teriyaki bento box, though, was disappointing. The salmon was actually decent, loved the texture..but we basically didn't eat anything else in the box. The bento rice was horribly dry, the salad & ginger dressing unremarkable, and my side of sashimi contained three square pieces of meh salmon rather than soft slices. Also, this isn't their fault at all but we were craving toro and thought that a restaurant called Toro sushi would sell, well, toro.. Service wasn't bad. Our waitresses didn't come by after getting us our food and we received our rolls before a dish of ginger and wasabi so by the time the dish was dropped off, we had already eaten the entire roll. We were seated quickly though. I'm not sure how happy I would have been if we had waited at all.

2015-03-02,2.0,"Very disappointed in my last meal here. I came here on a Saturday at 8 p.m. and was quoted an hour for the wait.  50 minutes later we call to see if we will be seated soon and are told it will be another 15 minutes.  We go back to the restaurant and we are finally seated at about 9:45 p.m.  Horrible.  Had I known the wait would be an hour and 45 minutes, I would have gone elsewhere.  The food left much to be desired.  We were given a complimentary portion of agedashi tofu, and I am glad we did not pay for it because it was vomitrocious.  Cold and gummy, just bad.  We ordered a Boston roll, spicy tuna roll, and an eel roll (the rock and roll).  First, the rolls are very small.  Generally not a problem, as long as they are filled with whatever is supposed to go in the roll.  However, our  Boston roll--just avocado and salmon--was also stuffed on the inside with rice.  This is basic sushi-making 101--create the roll properly so there isn't rice stuffed on the inside of the roll.  There were miniscule slivers of avocado and salmon and big chunks of rice.  At that point we were starving and just ate it.  The spicy tuna roll was too spicy--could not taste the fish at all.  The eel roll was good.  We also had the tempura, which was good.   Overall, this was a bad experience.  I waited a few days to write this to let the ""hangry"" side of me calm down, but I am still just very unhappy with my meal and I will not return.  Maybe the experience was poor because we were one of the last tables to be seated for the night (not by my choice), but if the food can't be prepared correctly at the end of the night, stop taking paying customers.",-0.9203,0.883,0.043,0.074,0.46862962962962956

2015-01-31,5.0,Some of the best sushi I have had in Chicago. If you go on a Thursday-Saturday night you are going to wait. Best to put your name in and go to a bar nearby. They will call you when ready. The owner is great if you have a chance to sit at the sushi bar and chat with him (he normally has a bandana and glasses on). Often order to go and sitll tastes great. They are very strict about how much alcohol you can bring (1 bottle of wine or 6 pack of beer per two people) but many BYOB places around are. The only other good sushi nearby if you do not want to wait is Ponzu but I just think Toro's fish is freshier. Izzo is also good but not BYOB.

Tried four different rolls and honestly didn't think any of them had much of a taste (the husband agreed and he can be a sushi snob). You do get a decent sized roll for the price you're paying, and they're fairly quick in getting it to your table, but nothing had a taste! I think this place has a lot of hype because it's so small and doesn't take reservations, so by the time you sit down you think you've made it and automatically begin thinking the food is better.

2015-01-26,2.0,"Sushi has long departed its status as an exotic excursion in major US cities where people venture to sample the highly sophisticated, yet wild food. Most customers of Toro Sushi, I presume, are not first-time sushi eaters and the restaurant provides an excellent means of endorsing their tastes. The selection of Maki and Nigiri/Shashimi is diverse and certainly interesting. The quality of fish is one of the best in the city for mid-level prices. The two-stars given to Toro at present has nothing to do with their food, for it is fantastic. However, the abysmal service and bland presentation fails to elevate this restaurant into the upper echelons of Chicago offerings that are able to provide a unique, defining experience despite the (at times mundane) prevalence of their cuisine.     There is no hostess, which given the small nature of the place, is understandable. However, the waitresses who serve intermittently as hostesses inconsistently follow reservations and give very poor estimates on availability; it is not uncommon to be told there are no tables for at least an hour and observe a party get seated while you waited outside talking with your friends (the party did not have a reservation, this was verified between both waitresses). Given its prestige, expecting some difficulty getting a table could be pardoned if it wasn't for the poor service. Either from being allotted too many responsibilities, underpay, or bad selection of service employees, the waitresses were absent for most of each meal. Each waitress has an unpolished disposition that would be expected of a mid-90s Chinese take-out restaurant with two tables for the occasional customer choosing to dine in.      The logistics of take-out and dine-in have not been properly established and it is common to see the best of Toro's sushi chefs working laboriously on take-out orders while multiple in-house orders are pending, leaving many patrons to wait extensively for their food. As a consequence, an ama-ebi sushi order was presented cold, when the head should be expected to be slightly warm. Also, the lack of efficient order management resulted in a hamachi being served ""ice-cold"". The fish was so cold that it contained ice-crystals in the center of the meat. Given the cold environment of the restaurant, the hamachi did not warm up to a palatable temperature even by the end of the meal; I am sure Mitch himself would never have served such a plate, but it was observed that he did not personally prepare this or assess the quality of his assistant's work. Appreciating the Inuit culture should not be an aspect of Chicago cuisine unless stated so on the menu. Sacrificing quality can be undesirable in any case, but valuing the quality of take-out over the dine-in experience seems flawed.     On the nature of the restaurant itself, it is evident immediately that little to no money has been invested in renovating the design or environment. The restaurant is poorly insulated, leaving most patrons to retain their frigid cold weather attire and it allows a most obvious and penetrating smell of pizza from the neighboring slice shop. The design, although distinct, is homely and unpolished. The plates and cups are all plastic and monotonic in design and color. Perhaps, the lack of quality in aesthetics allows for a casual appreciation of the quality fish, but the lack of environmental controls prevents even this from being accomplished.      Good people work here who care for their cuisine. Some reinvestment of money should be made in controlling the environment and improving service and logistics. The aesthetics of Toro Sushi could work for them and provide a high quality, casual sushi experience. However, as it stands, it serves as a poor understatement of Mitch's capacity and good nature.",0.9831,0.851,0.101,0.048,0.5353584229390682

They only had vegetable gyoza that came deep fat fried. So we passed on that. I had a side salad that was drowning in ginger dressing. Hubs had miso soup.

I got a Philadelphia roll and a crunchy and spicy California roll, which were both pretty good but not anything better than I could have gotten in Des Moines. My husband got a Crazy Horse roll and some mackerel nigiri which he thought were just ok; nothing special. We've had some really great sushi in Des Moines that we expect better quality sushi when we go to a bigger city like Chicago. Toro's sushi wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, either. We probably wouldn't come back here again just because we thought we could probably find some place better.",0.94,0.788,0.13,0.081,0.6492504409171076

2014-08-13,3.0,"Following a slightly overzealous viewing of ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi,"" I had gradually become more excited over the course of several weeks and was by the first major defrost of the roads, chomping at the bit for some of my own. (By the way, the aforementioned documentary is first-class and, if I'm not mistaken, is still available on Netflix streaming. Although, I would probably not use it to work up your sushi hopes too much.) This place was packed when we arrived for dinner, so we left our names and opted for a little walk around the neighborhood during an ~20 minute wait. Upon returning, we were seated at a narrow table by the wall. Following some indecision, we settled on uni, super white tuna, and mackerel sashimi, burdock root maki, a handroll, and some of the special rolls including my first experience with deep fried maki - which was unfortunately not a good one. In general, the quality of the traditional sashimi was good: texture of the uni was amazing and the mackerel was discernibly fresher than a some other places in town that have it on their AYCE. Having said that, the special maki definitely left me mildly scarred. I had ordered them initially to bulk out the meal, but, having tried them, found this to be terrible mistake; for several months following (as it is now late summer), I even avoided sushi altogether, and, upon reintroduction, I continued to suffer from general suspicion and mild terror whenever a dining companion at a sushi bar would ask me if I wanted a taste of the weird roll they had ordered.  (Aside: For anyone who feels unsafe upon reading this, thinking that there are rabid lolcats out roving the streets of Chicago ready to lash out violently at the prospect of being confronted with a California roll, I can thankfully declare that I am now mostly recovered with the help of some SSRI-laced Cat Chow and twice weekly cognitive behavioral therapy.) Service was quite slow, as could be expected due to the popularity. In the end, I was perhaps a little overeager to get out of there as I saw the check as the only thing standing between me and the McDonald's down the road. Maybe for those living in the area, it would be worth a pleasant albeit expensive visit to bridge the long, hungry minutes between dinner and supper, but between the drive, the wait, and the veterinary CBT expenses I can't see myself returning.",-0.1166,0.822,0.092,0.086,0.44212573918456255

I used to live for 5 years right around the corner so is go and out my name in and then they call when a table is ready so it was perfect, but you can head to a local bar and do the same. I don't live in the neighborhood anymore but I still come back to Toro - wait or not.  The quality of the fish plus the price and the awesomeness of Mitch can't be matched. His fish is always incredibly fresh and I love sitting at the bar when he's working to chat with him a bit and find out what's just come in, etc. He has often times comped us sashimi or let us try something new on the house. Probably my favorite sushi roll of all time is the Sunny - something about the sunflower seeds in there adds a great crunch with just the right amount of saltiness. Also love the Holla Jalapeño, Arizona, Ahi salad and spicy Tako rolls. The octopus there is flavored so well - delicious.  Toro has a special place in my heart and always will - it's worth the wait if you plan it right - you won't be sorry. And give Mitch a fist pump for me.",0.9949,0.783,0.209,0.008,0.5354357864357865
2014-08-08,1.0,"Would give zero stars if I could! This place is ridiculously overrated. I came at 5:05 to insure I'd get a table, and was one of the first tables here.  Fast forward to almost 50 mins later, I've had excuse after excuse why my simple order hadn't arrived (2 hand rolls, 2 pcs nigiri, and one small roll)... even after I asked the server to please stop making excuses, and just bring my food when it was ready. She ignored me, and just repeated, at length, the same excuse, 3 or 4 times: somehow a hand roll can only be rolled by the main chef, but 4 people work on the rolls, which was, of course, not mentioned when I made my order. Though I didn't say so, that doesn't even make sense: then have these four guys do the myriad rolls being delivered, and have the main chef do only the things only he can! After all this, I was treated as if I was the problem for not being satisfied with the situation and the excuses. Lack of listening & customer service were the issue, but she was completely oblivious. Meanwhile everyone around me is happily eating. When my order finally came 5 minutes later, it wasn't even correct: I ordered mackerel nigiri and they gave me salmon. I was done... I just asked them to bring the mackerel I ordered, a box, and the check. They couldn't even do that right... bringing a box that would hold barely one hand roll. When I protested, they took my food, packed it up, but didn't correct the incorrect nigiri. Now I had no nigiri in my box, had to reorder it and pay for it separately, adding further to my negative experience. I waited tables for years, and would never treat anyone the way I was treated!  I guess they don't care, because this place is packed, but it would have been nice for someone, anyone, a manager perhaps(?) to try to make my experience better. Guess that's just not in Toro's DNA. Went home and am glad I have my own chopsticks, because there were none in the bag. See my pics of the broken looking mackerel and falling apart negi maki... nothing tasted fresh, it even smelled fishy, and I live right around the corner.  I will never never eat here again! SIDE NOTE: After I left I couldn't shake the thought that the Escolar they were touting as ""Super White Tuna"" on the menu was something I'd heard about on the news... a quick Google search confirms it: several sushi places have been outed in Minneapolis for passing Escolar off as Super White Tuna, however it is not, and those in the know call it the ""ex-lax"" fish... Even the non-GMO regulating FDA warns about eating Escolar, as it contains a non-digestible compound that can cause ""nausea, diarrhea, and cramping...""

We were fortunate enough to be seated at the counter and Mitch greeted us warmly as we were seated. He was very friendly and it was amazing to watch him prepare all the orders. We tried a large variety of roles and some nigiri.  We had the hot finger roll as an appetizer which was very different but incredibly delicious. We also had the Chad Roll and Miami Roll which are specialty rolls. They were both unbelievably good. Lots of toppings but the flavors were all very well balanced.

Toro was my favorite for a very long time until I stumbled upon another Sushi place which I might give 6 stars, but it is a bit pricier and I have to go more often before I crown it to determine how consistent they are.  For now Toro remains on the throne.",0.7412,0.887,0.089,0.024,0.6196703296703296
2014-03-22,3.0,"Several years ago, I wrote a review for Toro Restaurant under another name ""Chillie D."" We arrived at 5:30 pm on a Friday, and got a legal parking spot in front of the restaurant which was really sweet :)  We started with two bowls of Miso soup which contained kelp (seaweed) and tofu. The soup was very average. The broth was cloudy and not clear, but it was flavorful. We ordered six different rolls, which we ordered according to the reviews at Yelp. Two of the rolls were not mentioned in the Yelp reviews, but we ordered the last two rolls to try something different or unique. Our favorite Sushi rolls were the ""Yum Yum"" (which we both agreed deserves four stars) followed by the ""OMG"" rolls (which we also rated with four stars). We really enjoyed all of the Sushi rolls. I felt something was ""off"" or missing from our experience. I believe that it was perhaps the lack of quality, fresh ingredients utilized in making the rolls. This is a BYOB, so bring your favorite wine to pair with with your sushi.  There are only 8 or 9 tables, so it is a very small restaurant. There are also eight stools at the bar where you can sit and watch the Sushi Master Chef making his sushi creations. Really cool. We were seated at a table for two. We noticed how much more crowded the restaurant was by the time 6:30 pm rolled around. People were standing in the door way as well as outside waiting for a table. Our total came to $62 and change (excluding the tip), which we both agreed is a reasonable price-point for two bowls of soup and six different Sushi rolls. The service was very average. Our Server didn't say that the other rolls were being made, so we thought maybe they FORGOT that we ordered six different rolls. When we asked her about the other two rolls she said ""Oh, they are being made. I'll bring them later."" However, this was never communicated to us when she dropped off our four different Sushi rolls. Duh!  We also needed extra napkins, but were not provided with any, so we took them off the table that was next to us since the table was empty at the time. Our EMPTY soup bowls kept us company for over one hour. The table was crowded with our Sushi rolls and there were plates all over our tiny table. We rearranged a few things to make room for these other plates. When our Server finally delivered the other two Sushi rolls that we had been waiting on for a while she never removed the empty soup bowls. Weird. Our water glasses were never refilled (from the moment we sat down at 5:30 pm until we left at 7:10 pm), so this was a bit disappointing. For these reasons, we did not leave a 15% tip. I've had much better Sushi elsewhere, but this place is affordable. Some of the Sushi is unique, while others are pretty typical Sushi. The plating of the rolls was not artistic, but then again this is a hole in a wall dive restaurant. This is not a place where you come for the ambiance. I rated the other Sushi rolls with THREE STARS only. I am not sure if this place is under 'new' management or not, but the Sushi was so much better years ago. Some of the ingredients were not very high quality and some of it didn't taste very fresh either. In fact, I could tell that some of the ingredients used were NOT fresh or high quality. I believe they produce quantity rolls over quality rolls. For this reason, I am giving Toro an over all rating of THREE stars.",0.988,0.876,0.089,0.036,0.5391846180639284

2014-02-17,1.0,"I don't write a lot of reviews but I wanted to warn other sushi lovers that with almost 800 reviews and a 4.5 star rating as of today, this place is severely overrated. I was visiting Chicago for a few days and, as I am a huge sushi lover, I looked on Yelp for a good sushi place. Toro immediately stood out with its plethora of 5 star reviews.  The fact that their menu has about 50 ""special rolls"" should have been a warning as to the quality of this restaurant--in general the best sushi restaurants serve mainly traditional nigiri, sashimi and maki and only a few special rolls--but I did not heed it as I can understand that restaurants have to respond to customer demand.  Whenever I go to a sushi restaurant for the first time I order simple pieces (no ""special rolls"") which most clearly showcase the quality of the fish and the rice. So I ordered similarly at Toro: salmon, white tuna (escolar), scallop, uni (sea urchin), and a salmon avocado roll.  The first thing I noticed was that the salmon avocado roll was literally falling apart. It looked like a 3-year-old had made it. Fine, I figured one of the less experienced staff members had made it, and was willing to overlook this if it at least tasted good. Unfortunately, it didn't, it tasted worse than supermarket sushi, both the fish and the avocado tasted days old.  The scallop was ok, nothing special but not bad.  The sea urchin was plain bad, tasted bitter, but I know that sea urchin can be hit or miss so I thought maybe this was a bad batch.  Then I got to the salmon and escolar, and the complimentary pieces of salmon sashimi they had added to my plate. And this was when I finally decided that the prior shortcomings were not just coincidences.  I almost gagged when I ate the salmon. Now, I have eaten at hundreds of sushi restaurants, and salmon is one of the items I order every time. The salmon at Toro was absolutely some of the worst I've ever had--possibly *the* worst. It tasted disgusting. I don't know if it was old or not, but it was most definitely NOT sushi-grade fish. More like cat food grade, and any sushi chef that serves this to their customers is not worthy of the title of sushi chef--sorry. Unfortunately I was sitting at the sushi bar, as I usually like to do, so I finished the rest of it out of politeness for the chef (who, as everyone says, is very friendly, but that does not make up for the bad quality of the fish). I shouldn't have, as I spent the rest of the evening in severe abdominal distress.  The white tuna was just as disgusting.  I don't like to imply that other reviewers don't know good food because Yelp reviews are usually spot on, but in this case, based on my experience at hundreds of sushi restaurants, I can honestly not give Toro more than one star. I've never regretted eating at a sushi restaurant, no matter how mediocre, until now. If you are visiting Chicago and only have time for one sushi restaurant, please do yourself a favor and do not go to Toro.",0.9948,0.727,0.177,0.097,0.557103825136612

As soon as we sat down they brought us complimentary miso soup!  That was really nice, and seriously appreciated - we were freezing!  We were by the window so it was a little cold, but I'd be cold by my windows in my own house.  They let us crank the heater up above our heads.  They were really accommodating. The food was very good, no complaints, but because we (my husband and I) only eat vegetarian sushi, I find that the spectrum from good to bad isn't as drastic as regular sushi. We did have two people with us that do eat fish, and they were really pleased with what they ordered.  One of the rolls they ordered had calamari on top, one of the others mentioned that she didn't really like calamari so she took it off her first piece, but then decided to give it a try on the second.  She said it was totally awesome and she didn't experience the ""poking"" sensation that she has had in the past when she had calamari in her sushi.  (She's pretty seafood adventurous so its not just an ick factor). The food was very good, the service was outstanding, we were very happy that we went. We had their fried icecream (or whatever they call it there?)

Thanks to communal seating, I had overheard people saying how this is the best sushi place in Chicago. He said he wasn't the best (how humble!) but he says what they do there is try to have the fish be as fresh as possible. I mean, that's what sushi is all about! So go for some reasonably priced sashimi. But they also have a huge menu of creative rolls, though Mitch insists they aren't the best in that regard. The three rolls he picked for us that highlight fish were: Crazy horse, cherry blossom, and spicy tako. Crazy horse was probably my favorite.  The ahi tuna roll makes for a great appetizer, because even though the fish isn't the star, it's super clean tasting - lots of greens, the ginger dressing that every Japanese restaurant uses, and a touch of tuna on top. It's what you'd have as an appetizer to a meal like this, except in roll form. My only complaint is the service. Really awkward, and a bit negligent/rude. It was probably the one day in the year that they wouldn't be busy, too... so I wonder what it's like normally when the wait is 1hr+...

When we asked for a new plate with not frozen fish and if we could possibly substitute it with a roll instead, the sushi chef came out to tell us that his fish was good and there was nothing wrong with what he served. In fact, he told me ""this is how sashimi is in Asia."" Let me just add that I am Asian and have been to Japan. Sashimi should not be served frozen. He kept insisting that his fish was good and instead of giving us a new plate of food, he brought out more frozen sashimi for us to ""prove"" the quality of the fish. We ended our meal with a bad taste in our mouths, two plates of uneaten-still frozen sashimi and when the bill arrived, we saw that the frozen fish (both the sashimi we ordered and what we thought was complimentary) was on our bill. The least they could have done was not charge us for the plate we ordered, but to tack on the plate the chef brought out as well was appalling.

For the amount of food that you get for the price, it's hard to not justify going to a restaurant with a little more ""oomph"" to it like sushi X, sunda, or butterfly. Zero points for ambiance at toro. Yes, it's Byob, which saves some $$ but the rolls are over priced.",0.9727,0.839,0.151,0.01,0.45064102564102565

The waitress was genuinely concerned with my husbands satisfaction which I found surprising and awesome.  She was great and put in the new order immediately and took away the previous roll.  The sushi was very good and the prices were fair.  When we received our check, we saw that she didn't charge us for the first roll.  I thought this was a prime example of going ""above and beyond"" with your customers.  They didn't do anything wrong, they could have charged us for that roll- but they understand the importance of return customers.

Tuna and salmon sashimi and nigiri were incredible. Fresh, perfectly cut and buttery.  We also ordered 2 maki rolls- the Best of Both Worlds and the spider roll. The simpler roll was better than the speciality roll. You could actually taste the ingredients when they aren't all smashed together.  So go for the quality of simpler sushi.  Service was fine. BYOB option is great.  The decor and ambiance could've been a lot nicer. As in a bigger space, dimmer lighting, some semblance if decor.

It's also BYOB, although I've never done that. Overall, highly recommended!",0.9763,0.743,0.244,0.013,0.6569230769230768

Almost every review said that the service was good, but either we came on a really off-night or the service was just okay, and that's me putting it nicely.  Kenny O. and I stopped by to put our names down a little bit after 6pm. The hostess told us that it'd be about 45 minutes. So we decided to walk around the neighborhood a little bit. We stopped by a record store and spent a good amount of time there. Then we went back to the restaurant. Nope, there's still another 20 minutes. Ok, so we went to Starbucks to get some coffee. We went back, and they still told us it'd be another 15 minutes or so. I felt annoyed, but after waiting so long, I decided that we better just wait it out. Eventually we got seated at the bar. The chef/owner gave us fistbumps when we sat down. I expected this after reading everyone's reviews. Ok, cool. Maybe things will get better. It took our server another 10-15 minutes to check up on us and to take our order. I was feeling a little nauseated from hunger pains. We ordered a salmon teriyaki bento box to share with some salmon sashimi as well as some futomaki. The futomaki was alright. I didn't expect it to come with asparagus, but ok, it's still good. The salmon teriyaki was delicious, and I loved the salmon sashimi even more. We decided to order a salmon nigiri as well. Still good. I think we also ordered some tuna, but I forgot if that was true or not.  The food was good. I'm just not sure it was worth all of the hype, considering the lack of service and attention we got. Almost everyone said that the chef made small talks with them. Nope. That didn't happen to us. I'd like to give them another chance one day, and I hope that the service will be much better then.

The restaurant itself needs to be cleaned with a steam cleaner, and frankly the fact that the owner fist-bumps everyone that comes in, while continuing to use the same un-gloved hands to make my sushi is unsanitary to say the least.

2013-03-01,4.0,"As a sushi lover and moving into the neighborhood recently, it made perfect sense to try the popular Toro.  It's BYOB (every Chicagoan's favorite 4-letter word) but they limit the amount you can bring it. I don't doubt if someone once over-did it and ruined it for the rest of us.  I went on a weekday and relatively early (6ish) and still had to wait 45 minutes. They do jot down your number and give you a call when a table is ready. The place is really REALLY tiny and tight. You will bump elbows with someone or step on someone's something on your way in and out. It's just the way it is. The place is not really decorated with anything fancy and the signs are handwritten on notebook pieces of paper. The economy is rough, I get it, but this place is always so packed, I'd figure they could invest a little into sprucing it up.  My date and I shared an edamame, miso soup and the Oh My God and Super White Crunchy rolls which all phenomenal. The Super White literally melts in your mouth and the sauce of the OMG is just ridic. It also comes with 'OMG"" written on the side, making it very Instagram-worthy. The service is pretty good and they get you in and out as quickly as they can without being too pushy, which I liked. The overall vibe just seemed a little dry and if I was any slightly bigger, I'd definitely be bumping into people a lot more.  I would suggest this place better as a carry-out option as their food is solid but my issue is more with the actual space of the restaurant.

2013-01-22,2.0,"It's not like this restaurant needs anymore reviews as it approaches 700...but the Woody Allen narcissist in me cries in a whiny New York accent...""Whhhhyyy would you nooooot??"" Therefore, I commence my (probably not well-accepted) review of Toro. This is a delayed review from an experience at Toro over a month ago, but hey...better late than never, right?   Early in December, I went on a date with a sushi novice, so I took charge. It was busy, crowded, and I felt like the staff's energy made it obvious that they were rushing everything. I'm still getting used to this BYOB thing (having lived in Chicago for only a few months), and I'm not a fan, but I won't complain about it. Not the restaurants fault at all. I took fellow Yelpers' advice on the white tuna crunch roll and another roll for my date because I'm not one for rolls, in particular. I have a lot of rolls, but Toro's rolls were...honestly...just OKAY. I like my fish Tom Hanks style in Cast Away, where he simply gnaws on a live fish...mmmm. I ordered my ""go-to"" Chirashi to test out the Chef's skills, as I always do. I hate to rain on everyone's parade who loves this place, but that evening, a sashimi ""no-no"" was committed. A big no-no. Ready for this? Here it is: I could still tell that my sashimi was frozen. Oh, the horror...the humanity!!!!  I couldn't believe it. If I wanted a fish popsicle, I'd hit up some weird italian ice place....come on.... I understand that in the Midwest, fish has to be frozen to keep its freshness. However, if you are a well-known, well-liked sushi establishment in a busy part of town...well, don't skip the important steps. The crucial steps. The steps that keep (self-claimed) sushi connoisseurs such as myself coming back for more. AKA: thaw thoroughly and to perfection. I would have given this place a one star, but I believe that if Toro would like to redeem itself, I'd be willing to give it another shot.  I suppose I need some serious convincing, though...and that's unlike me. Hopefully, the Toro gang will at least take the time to read this review and make sure that certain sushi ""no-no's"" do not happen again. Not for me, in particular, but for the sake of other sashimi lovers like me, and for Toro's reputation in general. I feel like the wet blanket in this discussion, but I'm a pretty terrible liar.

They always chill your drinks for you (especially nice when there is a long wait, they'll stick your stuff in the fridge) and they are very friendly. My main problem is I feel that the quality has gone down in the last year. We ordered our usual favorites and just found them to be really inconsistent on recent trips. Other main problem is some of the rolls start tasting really similar due to heavy saucing. However, that being said, we still find ourselves here if we are in the area craving sushi and I second the people who say to get the super white crunch roll, its tasty.",0.8479,0.862,0.101,0.037,0.3482873851294904

2013-01-11,3.0,"The first time I went here I was seated almost immediately and had one of the best sushi experiences of my life. The menu is big, with creative names and clever pairings that you have to try to believe. Mitch even gave myself and my girlfriend a cut of salmon and another type of fish, and explained to us the proper color, texture and taste that should accompany the aforementioned. Very good tasting sushi. My g/f and I had a fair amount of food for a surprisingly small bill ($28).  The second time we went to Toro, we waited by the door, crammed next to a group of three. A couple came in the door and preceded to sit down at a now open table -- what the -- it's okay, the guy said, they put their name down a while ago and came back. No problem there. Then a group of five girls came in the door and waited....and waited. Finally a server came over to all of us...only to say, ""Can you please shut the door"" (it wasn't open). Nothing about seating. Five minutes later, the server is floating around and we catch her and ask if the two of us will be able to get a table. Nope. The restaurant is closing (in about an hour). If there were three couples ahead of us, I could understand. But no mention of who, if anyone, was ahead of us. No mention of anything. Communicate with us. Use your words. The fact that there is not a dedicated host at all times taking walk-ins and questions is beyond me. This is a sushi restaurant that absolutely demands that.  Overall, love the sushi, and Mitch is great. If you can get a seat, it is a treat. Nice rhyme.

2012-11-20,5.0,"This is by far my favorite sushi place in Chicago. I have sought out sushi on every coast, in many cities and I have been lucky to find some really amazing rolls and not so lucky more times than I can count.  I have waited in line for them to open on Saturdays and spent weeknights waiting over 90 mins for a table at 9pm. I suggest going 4pm Sat or before 6pm on weeknights if you want to get in quick.  I have been coming here since around the time they opened, about every 6-8 weeks for my fix. Toro gets it right and they get it right every time. I love how inventive some of the rolls are. I love that Mitch makes everything and takes the time to go to the fish market himself and pick out the best fish every day. He cares immensely about the quality of food he picks out. I am saddened that the place is so small but understand its because of Mitch wanting to keep it great and make everything.

Adding mushrooms, sunflower seeds, and more in combination with great sauces that make the flavors come together.

2012-10-06,4.0,"Toro may not be the world's best but for what it is, a small sushi restaurant in yuppy Lincoln Park, it's pretty good. For me, the way to test its yumminess is if I have a lasting impression / craving a few days after I go. This usually happens for me w/ the sashimi or nigiri, and this place seems to specialize on rolls. I came away craving really only one roll (spicy tako maki.) We waited for Toro for 2 hours! We made a big mistake by not putting our names in earlier. We arrived and we were told that we'd have to wait 1.5 hours. We came back with 30 min to go, and then received a call that we'd have to wait 30 more min! By the time we started eating, it was 10pm. I was trying to be a good sport but those last 10 min were rough. Noting our edginess, the waitress came by with an order of agedashi tofu on the house. (Why are people in Chicago so nice?? They know how to treat their customers.) Here is what we ordered (among 3 people): AGEDASHI TOFU (on the house): 5 - I think this almost tops my list in terms of favorite dishes here. I love tofu, and I think this particular tofu was made fresh. The agedashi broth was soooo flavorful and the textures were perfect. MISO SOUP (with sushi order): 2 - nothing notable CHIRASHI: 3.5 yum, but a little disappointing. Everything was fresh, but things weren't quite right. (The documentary 'Jiro Dreams of Sushi' has ruined me and my idea of good sushi. Drool.)  The red snapper was tough, the salmon a little too fatty (though that is tasty), and the tuna was sliced too thinly (maybe because of our overfishing and tuna shortage?) There were a few great pieces, including the pink one (can't remember the name!), which was really soft, and the tamago egg sushi, which had great texture. They were nice and made sure there were 3 pieces of each sashimi, one for each. As usual, we couldn't finish the sushi rice (very flavorful) so our friend took it home. then we ordered four rolls (no thanks to the cream cheese ones! what is that???) SPICY TAKO MAKI: 5. This was by far my favorite roll of the night. There were 6 pieces of sushi with an octopus salad on top -- great flavor and balance, and the octopus was so so yummy. I would go back just to eat this roll.  SPICY TUNA CRUNCH ROLL: 4. I can't stay away from crunchy fried stuff. Guilty pleasure. We were surprised by how much we just really enjoyed it.  KAMIKAZE: 3. It was a good idea, but flavors weren't that strong (could use more scallion, less of the sauce that was holding it together) and the amount of fish topping the roll was overwhelming.  I can't remember the last one but it was spicy - something jalapeno?? 2. It was terrible - not sure why anyone would make a roll with a dipping sauce this spicy because it numbs your tongue to the flavors of the fish! I was not happy about this because I wanted to really taste everything, and I had to wait to wash out the spicy with rice and water. Not a fan of this one. We were able to finish everything. Again, I'd come back for the spicy tako maki. I'm continuing my search w/ the sashimi and nigiri.",0.9987,0.763,0.192,0.045,0.5352075702075704

The food was good, don't get me wrong, but no where near the level of amazing that I'd expect with a daily wait of 1 hr+! (we ate at 8 on a Sunday) Bf and I got a basic miso soup to start (a little too salty. had to dilute mine w/ water), and 4 chef special rolls: OMG, Best of both worlds, Midway, and Starry Night. All of them were yummy. My fav was Best of Both Worlds - really fresh and light tasting. Bf's fav was Midway, which was a bigger roll that felt and tasted like they stuffed a small bit of everything in it.  What I liked about the rolls: they were consistent, well presented, and the fish fresh in all. What I didn't like was that there seemed to be a large amount of crab salad incorporated in most of them....which got repetitive/overpowering by the end. Also, at some point, I turned around and noticed that I was the only asian in the entire restaurant and the crowd still waiting outside. That did trigger some warning bells in my head, because to me that usually signifies that the restaurant places a heavier emphasis on ingredients like cream cheese, tempura, and crab stick than fresh fish or lighter makis..but maybe it's just cuz there's not a lot of asians in lincoln park? =S Either way, it doesn't matter, because we would definitely return to Toro. Not only is it good, it's verrry reasonably priced. Bf often gets the lunch special teriyaki boxes (without me =.=), which are an amazing deal at SEVEN BUCKS!! and, according to him, always delish.

We sat down, the service wasn't abysmal, but nothing impressive - made us feel like rightful patrons.

I believe the bill came up to be $80 excluding tip for 6 rolls and 3-4 pieces of nigiri (which, imho, you should be spending at Sunda, Mizu or Wabi... now you know this is going to get ugly...). I guess when we are talking about maki rolls governed by sauce and crunch, freshness doesn't really apply. But for what it's worth, the quality of the fish on the nigiri isn't plucked-out-the-ocean as gossiped about. In fact, it is the same colorful block of transcontinental sashimi, both bland and monotonous. However, there still can be great maki rolls that can be made out of those (I've seen it done!). But (another ""but"") that wasn't the case - at least not a 4.5 star-deserving case. The rolls we had were not ""Yay, I'm a fan!"" Some were arguably a few steps below Whole Foods and a couple rungs above Southern Tsunami. They were merely ""A-Ok,"" ... ... BUT (we're on three strikes here) not for $10-$15 a roll.

I sent it back and received a replacement, but we were still charged.  The rolls were just okay (spicy tuna and philadelphia).  The Monster Midway roll was good, and probably the best we had, but the $17 Holla Holapeno was not good and not worth the price.  I love sushi and I've had sushi all over the country and this place was really not worth the money.  I doubt we'll be going back.  We recently tried Hatsu Hana and I thought their food was better and much more reasonably priced.",0.9782,0.772,0.177,0.051,0.4267023809523809

2012-02-05,5.0,"I've been meaning to write a review for Toro Sushi since March 2010, when my one and only visit to Toro changed my life.  My boyfriend and I took a road trip to Chicago from NY for our last college spring break. I am proud to say that we ate our way through Chicago during the 4 days we were there. Because I am the anal and organized type, I wanted to make sure we had a set plan for each day (which helped us do so much in so little time). Toro, however, was a last minute find on yelp and to this day, I am thankful. We were starving after our 14 hour drive and luckily found Toro on yelp. For a weeknight around 8 pm, the restaurant was packed! I think we had a 30 minute wait so we walked around the block - poked around a coffee shop, walked by a bike shop, and tried an empanada next door.  So why did Toro change my life? This is where I took my first bite of sushi at age 21. My family was always big on sushi (ordered those huge sushi boats from Korean sushi restaurants) but I always sat at the edge of the table away from the stench of fish, eating my bowl of udon.  We got seats at the bar and met Mitch, the owner and sushi master of Toro. You can tell right away tell that Mitch has a special relationship with his regulars. I saw him exchange a special handshake/bump with a few customers who stopped by to greet him.  Right after my boyfriend told Mitch that I was a sushi virgin, Mitch cut up two generous slices of super white fish, yellowtail, and salmon (complimentary). He told me to eat them in that order. After a few minutes of hesitation, I finally had the balls to take that first bite of the super white. It was cold and just melted in my mouth like butter. There was no fishy taste because it was so fresh. It didn't take me long to move on to the yellow tail and then to the salmon. Mitch is the wonderful genius of a man who took away my sushi virginity. He said he's converted a handful of others (so if you've never tried sushi, I recommend you to Mitch who will cure your disease).  I think my boyfriend was relieved to see that I liked the sushi because that meant we could go ahead and order our meal. I don't remember which rolls we ordered but I'll post photos. We DEVOURED each plate, including the bed of salad one of the rolls was sitting on. Mitch also gave us a free plate of the tempura green tea icecream. Very good but a bit too heavy for me. I probably slurped up all the ice cream though. We got the check and was shocked and happy to see our bill was no more than fifty or sixtyy bucks (including a generous tip).  We left Toro happy and full. We took a picture with the sign outside that says ""Sushi Makes Better Lovers"" (which originally said ""Sushi Make Better Lover"" - I assume the grammatical error of a Korean was corrected by a customer. I think sushi did make us better lovers hahaha how cheesy but I believe that. Thank you, Mitch, for giving me this life changing experience.",0.9983,0.771,0.182,0.047,0.5297838568051334
2012-02-01,3.0,"I would give the food and service 4 stars, but my overall experience was only a 3 since they stuck our party of five by the door and it was freezing.  I kept my coat and scarf on the entire meal and I still couldn't get warm....the miso soup helped a little, but getting bumped by the people waiting at the door added to a subpar experience. The food itself was good, we oredered the OMG roll, super-white crunch, and a specialty roll that I can't remember.  My favorite was the super-white crunch, the mango matched really well with the super white tuna, and the tampura crunch gave it a nice contrast in texture.  The service was fine, it was busy so there was some waiting to ask for more water and the low-sodium soy....but expected.   I would go back again, but not with more than 4 people to our group.  The place is definitely more suited for 2-4 people, any more and you're party will feel cramped.  I would also avoid getting seated next to the door, it's uncomfortable literally having people over your shoulder and getting bumped....it's also a popular restaurant so there's a lot of door traffic  Hope my next experience here is more enjoyable.",0.9837,0.765,0.177,0.059,0.4913194444444445

I also appreciated it when the Gulf oil spill happened and the owner put a notice on the window that they do use Gulf seafood for their customers to be aware. Very good and honest person.  He recognizes my sister every time we go here because she can't stay away. Easily one of the best Sushi places in town. And I love hearing complaints about the people who don't know how popular this place is when they hear the wait time. Or that they can't handle anymore reservations for the night. Instead of thinking, ""Hey this place must be really good,"" they say, ""How dumb"" and go to one of the nearby sushi places that only exist for Toro's spillover crowd.

And the one that comes with a sparkler (the Volcano, I think) is just awesomely presented and tastes amazing (though salt haters should steer clear). There was a bit of a wait on the fish, which we were told about up front so were prepared for, though no wait for a two top on a Thursday night. Only issue is that we were FREEZING the entire meal. The thin curtain between the door and the dining room is way insufficient, so maybe get takeout in the colder months or show up with a serious buzz so you won't feel it.

Ordered very early, 6pm, and it was an hour wait for our food.  Because we knew this ahead of time, it wasn't a big deal.  But when it got to be close to an hour, my husband went in and it seemed like our order kind of slipped through the cracks - it became a hurry up to get it to us.  My husband, who is a much more adventurous sushi eater than I am, ordered several of the special rolls, which he said were wonderfully creative and delicious.  I don't really love sushi and ordered more standard fare, such as the spicy tuna roll - which was disappointing.  It was a tiny roll with very little tuna.  Another difficulty for patrons who want to do carryout: the restaurant does not post their special roll selections online or on the carryout menu.  So if you are a newbie and don't know what to order, you have to go in and look at the menu.  Since my husband really liked his meal, I would say we would order again for his birthday - but otherwise, it won't be on our regular rotation.",0.7064,0.889,0.072,0.039,0.5138329851966216

I had been long anticipating such an amazing sushi place and/or 2. We had just gotten back from Maui and their sushi is TO DIE FOR delicious.

It's a hole-in-the-wall place that you'll probably wait an hour to get a table in, but boy is it worth it.  You won't find sushi like this anywhere else in the midwest, and I'd even go so far as to say that it rivals many top NYC sushi restaurants (that's a bold statement having lived in NYC prior to Chicago). Toro isn't cheap, but nor is it outrageously expensive.  It's my go-to sushi place in the city and I've never been disappointed by my dining experience.  In fact, I have an entire rating system for the various sushi rolls.  Each time I go, I have to order at least one of my favorite rolls, then try and branch out for something new. In addition to the set menu, there are always random new rolls being added by the sushi chef (usually featured on a quickly printed 8.5 x 11 paper on the wall).  Plenty of amazing options to choose from.  Here are a few of my faves: - Red Dragon:  far and away the best roll at Toro.  Order it every time i go. - Super White Crunch:  super white delicious! - Big 10: very good - Miami:  muy excellente - Sunny:  really really good - Best of Both Worlds:  best of a lot of yumminess   I have to say, I've never had any issues with the service, but to all those who have - come on!  if you need to be pampered go pay $1000 to eat at Alinea.  This is a phenomenal sushi joint and if you're complaining about the service, you're probably not worthy of the delicious food in front of you!",0.9973,0.725,0.239,0.036,0.5247051597051599

We came early on a Saturday night so we could avoid a wait and it paid off, we only waited not even 10 minutes for a table. Once thing I noticed right away, the sushi was VERY fresh. We decided to get the Sushi dinner along with a couple other rolls. All very fresh all very delicious. Its a little bit on the pricey end but its definitely worth it. The restaurant itself is very small and probably would not  be good for groups over 5 or 6 but for two its just perfect.

As good as it gets!"" rating ;)  Me and the bf went based on the great reviews and the fact that we didn't have to eat immediately.  Well, guess I didn't read enough reviews b/c the wait for 2 on a Friday night around 8:30pm was 1 1/2 hours (they close at 10pm).  So since we had a pretty chill day and planning for a chilled evening, we said ok we'll wait.  Luckily there are plenty of places nearby to hang out & wait, like Molly's cupcakes next door (that's its own review!) Must say....definitely worth the wait.  Since me and the bf filled up on cupcakes (when we were waiting....) we didn't order as much as planned. Here's the order: Edamame (make just perfect, not too soggy as some places; great for appetizer and wanting something to munch on) Super white sashimi (3 small pieces) (absolutely delicious!! they were very small pieces but it was only 5.50 so just get another order!) Oh my God roll (picked this due to the hype it received on the reviews.  it was good, but i'm not a huge eel and tempura fan, i prefer just sashami all day, everday if i could.  but my bf whose a huge eel fan LOVED it!) Catepillar (generic but tasty and make perfectly, the caviar and avocado pairing was a great combo for my taste buds) El Feugo (my absolute favorite! tuna, superwhite, fresh jalepeno, scallions all in one?? sign me up! this was a fluke order too b/c originally i wanted the spicy tako but they were out.  but i'm glad i got to try this one b/c it was my favorite of the night!)

We polished this one off in about 30 seconds flat Spider Roll - Melt in your mouth good, though I always have trouble fitting those end pieces in my mouth.

Service/Atmosphere:  The seating capacity is very limited, so the wait can be very long.  We came in on a Thursday night (party of 3), and we only had to wait about 45 min, which isn't too bad.  There are more tables of 2 in the restaurant, so I would advise coming in smaller parties if you're not wanting to wait  This isn't a place that you would come if you are searching for a romantic or upscale atmosphere.  This is somewhere you would go simply for the love of its food and the charisma of the sushi chef/owner.  As soon as we were seated at the sushi bar, the chef greeted us with a fist pound as if were his friends.  He entertained us throughout the night, so I highly recommend sitting at the sushi bar if it is your first time.  He might even give you free samples. :) Food: -Hamachi (Yellowtail): This is my staple when I come to sushi restaurants, and this can be a make it or break it for me.  The Hamachi here was the best that I had thus far in Chicago.  Slightly buttery, tender, rich flavor, clean aftertaste. Perfection. -Rolls:    Kamikaze: This has to be my favorite roll of them all.  Basically it is a roll topped with mixture of different cut up RAW fish, sunflower seeds, scallion, masago and then mixed in spicy mayo.  The sunflower seeds definitely give it a extra kick.    MJ: This is more of a savory roll, since it is deep fried.  It wasn't one of my favorites though.    Ahi Salad: This isn't truly a sushi roll, but more like a fresh spring roll in that it's wrapped in rice paper (what they use for spring rolls).  It's filled with salad, tuna, other veggies, and then topped with spicy mayo and ginger dressing.  I really enjoyed it, and I think it makes a great appetizer.  Gives a very fresh feeling, and sometimes that's what you want after eating heavy rolls.      Spring Blossom:  This also has to be another favorite.   Mango goes very well with spicy rolls.  I will definitely order this again on my 2nd visit.      Awesome: There are three types of fish that is seared on top of the roll (Tuna, White Tuna, and Salmon), so that can give a slight fishiness.  It's topped with blue cheese, which gives an excellent aftertaste.       -Tempura Ice Cream- They were out of green tea, so I got the vanilla.  IT was friggin AMAZING.  Most places I know use poundcake over the ice cream, and deep fry it.  This tasted a lot better than what I'm usually used to, and I freakin love tempura ice cream.  I'm very curious what they use for the breading.   They top it with powdered sugar.       -on the menu, you will see TIFFANY SAUCE in the descriptions a lot.  This is simply just spicy mayo.",0.9985,0.793,0.198,0.009,0.5250552608311229

So, I've stayed away from sushi and really anything too adventurous. Lately I've gotten really bored of eating the same things, so I've been trying to branch out to gluten free friendly places, and trying out different gluten free menus. Toro doesn't have a dedicated gluten free menu. They do have really informed waitstaff, with great suggestions for gluten free dining. Which is awesome! I ate with my two non-GF friends and they were able to share their rolls and mine. We ordered a few different rolls, and I think my favorite was the El Fuego without tempura and the Boston roll.  I was also informed by my waitress that Sriracha is not gluten free. Although I've eaten it and have never had a reaction before. I decided to eat it anyway, because of my history. I just Googled it and it's been confirmed by the company that it is, in fact, gluten free. The vinegar they use is gluten free. They also didn't look at me funny for bringing in my own gluten free soy sauce. I do really appreciate that.

My friends who had the salmon nigiri said it was very good. Overall, very good sushi. Rolls are around $12-15 each, and there is 20% gratuity for parties of 5 or more.

2011-07-27,4.0,"My boyfriend and I are steadily working our way through our list of sushi places to try, and this was up. A friend of ours who's got high food standards said it's one of the best he's had. So with his opinion, a majority of good reviews, and an appetite for sushi, we headed out. In terms of wait, it was what everyone said it would be...approximately 45 minutes. But we weren't in a hurry, and they called us actually a little bit earlier than expected and said our table was ready to go. The staff is very courteous, though it actually took them a little time to bring us water. But the restaurant was filled to capacity, with more people coming in.  We each ordered one maki roll and one ""Mitch's Special"", and my boyfriend added a plate of sashimi. The quality of the fish was sooo good. Oh, the salmon was delicious and seemed to melt in my mouth. For the rolls, I was so pleased at the minimum amount of rice that was used. I could actually taste all the fish and the other elements of the roll without getting overwhelmed by rice, and it was nice to not feel bloated without excess rice expanding in my stomach.  The only problem was that it was pretty loud in there. I was fine with hearing the people right next to us. You can't really help it when the table is only four inches away. But we were getting drowned out by tables further away from us. I guess when tables are that close to each other, people talk louder to compensate for their ""next-door"" neighbors' conversation, then everyone else talks louder...and next thing you know, it's a roar worthy of a Sox game.

This was a bit of a shock because I was not expecting that but I tried to not let that overshadow the rest of the meal. I also ordered the unagi nigiri and it was really good, better than I have had at other sushi places on Clark. Based on the recommendation of other reviews we ordered the Awesome roll and another roll that the name escapes me. The rolls were definitely fresh and totally made up for the appetizer.

2011-06-08,5.0,"My girlfriend and I went here on one of our earlier dates and we loved it. The specialty rolls are huge -- like, 12 pieces huge. Everything was extremely fresh and pleasantly aromatic. The service was fast and we weren't rushed. Though, I've developed a love for sushi, I'm not a tuna fan, and there was plenty on the menu for me to love. The fish and veggies are as fresh as it gets and the sushi rice was perfectly flavored without being a too-filling distraction. I'm looking forward to having more of their specialties and I hear that if you sit at the bar, you'll have plenty of unique sample concoctions. It's BYOB, but the place is small and the nights will have you waiting for a table, so their limits on how much alcohol you can bring in are reasonable. You can't make a reservation, but waiting a half-hour or 45 minutes shouldn't be a big deal. (It's Lincoln F'N Park. You can grab a drink down the street while you wait for them to call you, go to the liquor store, and be at your table.) The only difference is instead of grabbing a drink before the restaurant, you give them your name/number, grab the drink or take a walk through the beautiful neighborhood, and then eat. The place is loud, but not enough to inhibit conversation. The more people you have, the longer you'll wait, bit again, if you can't find something to do to kill 30-45 minutes in LP, you're no fun and won't be pleased with anything. ""Moderate"" isn't completely accurate for the price range, when you factor in the high volume of food you receive for the price and that it's BYOB. Our tab was about $25 before tip for two specialty rolls and a maki; and we were in a tad of a euphoric food coma. Considering the volume you receive and the quality of the food, I'd call it ""cheap"", in that you get more than you pay for.

Combo Sashimi ( 5 types of sashimi ,15 pcs chefs choice, $25) was great as well!!

It was a lot of food and just so-so. They had a lot of yummy sounding appetizers though so looking forward to trying others on future visits.

We wanted a light lunch, so we only got two rolls, the Crazy Horse and the Miami.  They didn't take long to be prepared, and the presentation was absolutely gorgeous.  The Miami roll was very long - 7 or 9 good size pieces - and it was luscious.  I can't remember everything that was on it, but I know there was eel involved.  It was on the special maki list.  The Crazy Horse roll had only six pieces, but they were large and bursting with deliciousness.  The end pieces of the Crazy Horse were shaped differently, with pieces of fish and vegetables decoratively flowing out of the top of the roll.  I pulled a few of the pieces of fish out to eat separately as sashimi, and they were impeccably fresh.  I just closed my eyes and relished the moment while I chewed.   Given all the great reviews, it sounds like everything here is great, but whatever you order, make it something where you can really taste the fresh fish, because they are working with superb ingredients.  This is definitely one of the best sushi places I've ever visited, and I would absolutely come back next time I'm in the city.",0.9974,0.717,0.247,0.036,0.6133082706766918

2011-04-09,4.0,"Yeah...I'm a fan. I was hesitant at first; 4 & 1/2 stars on 500+ reviews? I was trying to figure out what people were smoking that got Toro to such baller status, because I've walked by it many times while in the neighborhood and wasn't impressed. But I guess I shouldn't judge a book by it's movie. As many have said already, Toro is a small place; it can seat approximately 20-25 people max. With that said, prepare to wait. But the nice thing is that they take down your name and number to call you when your table is almost ready. That gives you time to have dessert first [a la Molly's], because if you're like me, you eat too much during dinner and skip out on dessert. My party of four waited about thirty minutes [we were quoted an hour] on a Wednesday night at about 7:30 PM. Not too bad considering we were prepared to wait a while. We ordered a good amount for four; five rolls, one hand roll, and a dinner entree. Based on a very scientific experiment, the ranking of rolls from best to not-so-best is as followed: OMG: The name says it all. There's actually so much going on with this roll, but somehow everything comes together like symphony. Kamikaze: The sauce is boss, though I wasn't sure about sunflower seeds and sushi...but it added a new texture to what would have been a regular roll. Volcano: It came out with sparklers. SPARKLERS. And it's deep fried. I think that says it all =) Three Musketeer: Three types of fish...and they were very fresh. Trixie: I think there was a little too much going on. If there was one or two fewer ingredients, it would've been great. The chicken teriyaki was aight. Nothing to order more than once. The California hand roll was consumed by one person in our party, and it wasn't me. So I can't give any suggestions about it. I'm going to guess that it was good because it disappeared in but a few minutes. Service was on point; can't really complain. They didn't complain when we paid with four different credit cards. Cost for the four of us was about $85, not bad considering the quality and quantity of food (we were all full). You can't beat $20-$25/person for quality sushi. You just can't. Had the wait been less and the hot entrees been on the same level as the rolls, Toro would've easily gotten to that five-star status. But that doesn't mean I'm not returning.

There are dozens upon dozens of these type of trendy yuppie-targeted sushi joints in Chicago, all serving the same Godzilla and Caterpillar rolls with lots of tempura and spicy mayo and all that, but Toro does stand out as one of the better ones. Their rolls are actually very unique and quite tasty, with fun yuppie-friendly names to go along with them like ""Oh My God"" and ""Awesome"" and ""Kamikaze"" among others. This is the sushi place to go when you've just graduated college and finally have enough money to spend more than $10 on a meal. Oh, and it's BYOB! Fantastic!  A couple of warnings, though... The place is small and pretty popular. If you're trying to go with a group of more than two people, you should probably show up an hour before you actually want to eat to put your name on the waiting list and get some drinks elsewhere. Also, I'm sorry to say the nigiri isn't that spectacular. The amaebi was pretty good, the uni was alright, but the hamachi was extremely mediocre and disappointing. Lesson learned: come to Toro for the rolls, not the nigiri.  Overall, this place is much better than the trendy fusion sushi places I've been to in the Loop area and very unpretentious, which is greatly appreciated.

Up until somewhat recently, I'd been helplessly addicted to Joy-Yee's Shabu Shabu in Chinatown, but given their change in chef and subsequent lackluster meals, my friend and I tried Toro. Hello, love. Toro gets busy, and yes there isn't always much room, but I'm not the fussy type. When I bring friends to town, we typically aim to arrive towards the beginning of dinner service, so as to avoid lines. That said, the wait has never been absurd, and they gladly take a phone number to alert you that your table's ready (which means ample time to check out Molly's Cupcakes next door). Highly recommended: the ""Oh my god"" roll (you'll say it: you can try not to, but one bite and you'll be calling it by name), the Southern Gals (deep-fried with mozzarella; it's divine), and a host of others named after the customers that inspired them.

We were quoted with a 30-45 minute expected wait time, and they called us about 25 minutes later to seat us.  I liked that they took a cell phone number so we could grab a drink nearby instead of waiting in the extremely crowded space.  Fine, it's Lincoln Park, so tables are going to be close, but I wasn't happy with my seat facing the bathrooms.  Not exactly appetizing.  Signage is a little preschool - handwritten sushi roll descriptions and strict magic marker BYOB signs surrounded us as we ate (limit 1 bottle of wine or 1 bottle of saki - repetitive since saki is wine - or 1 six pack per table).  I would rather enjoy my drinks elsewhere, anyway.   It was kind of like being in a kindergarten classroom where all the students are white and all the teachers are Asian.  Maybe the lack of Japanese patrons should have tipped me off. Started with age dashi tofu, which came swimming in a large bowl of dark sauce and served with two soup bowls.  I had to ask if it was a soup, and the server told us it was just a sauce, although some customers do drink it.  The presentation is confusing - really way too much sauce for such a small portion of tofu.  Instead of the soaking tub that just diminished the fried crispiness of the tofu, I would have preferred the sauce on the side to control the dips.  The benito flakes were a cool aesthetic addition - they danced around on the top of the dish like the crazy balloon guy from Great America.  It was mesmerizing, until you ate them and were brought back to a strange bland reality. Water was served in those yellow/brownish plastic cups from the 80's.  I was really turned off by this, as presentation is a big deal for me.  It was another flashback to kindergarten snack time...just missing the animal crackers. We tried three rolls: salmon crunch, super white crunch (tuna and mango were the main draws for this roll), and a deep fried unagi mess with a ridiculous name.  I was so excited for this one, but the sushi rice and fried coating arrived mushy and overpowering.  I hardly tasted anything but the rice in all three rolls. The tempura green tea mochi caught my eye before we ordered, but the fried choices we had during dinner made me want to get out of there as soon as possible. I should have stuck with my sushi go to - Tank, but I wanted to see what all the hype and long lines was about.  I guess you have to try everything once.",0.923,0.857,0.083,0.06,0.4893231506439053

We ended up ordering the O-M-G roll, volcano roll, sunny rolls, and the spicy salmon rolls.  The volcano roll came out with a sparkler in the middle which made the presentation nice but unfortunately the rolls itself were ok, nothing special just ok.  The sunny rolls sounded interesting but the seeds they used gave it a weird taste and the mango didn't compliment the salmon.  The O-M-G rolls were opposite of what it was, again it was just O-K.  I must say I did really enjoy the spicy salmon, it was creamy and delicious and  the only thing I have no complaints about.

We got a table on a Tuesday night right away and our sushi came out quickly. Suffice it to say, the sushi was some of the worst I've had and incredibly disappointing. The rolls were bland (we got the ""O"", Negi Hama, and the Rock and Roll), they fell apart right away (rice was not sticky at all) and each roll seemed watery.  The fish did not taste very fresh as well.

The nigiri pieces are bigger than any place with a comparable price point. Basically, you get fresher, bigger, cuts of fish with a chef that actually pays attention to which cut he's giving you. Yes, you will probably end up waiting fro a table if you go any night of the week after 6:30pm.  If you're in the market for a california roll, its probably not worth the wait.  If you want good fish as fresh as we get it in Chicago, go here.",0.9161,0.809,0.135,0.057,0.4792250233426703

Considering the fact that on that strip is Aloha, Mollys, Litos, and the newly founded Del Seoul! Im glad I finally got to sample the goodness that is Toro! First off, BYOB, and theres no cork fee! 2nd, come early or be prepared to wait. I went last night w my date, and I completely forgot they close at 9:30 PM. I walked in w my date at 9:20 and they were very kind enough to seat us since apparently a few other parties had just gotten seated not too long before us. We started off w miso soup, which you can never really go wrong with. Next up, the special rolls. Now usually Ill get some maki, but I strongly suggest you try the specialty rolls! We decided to go with ""best of both worlds,"" ""kamikaze,"" ""southern gals,"" and ""3 amigos."" I should note as well, the servings here are on the generous side! While waiting for the rolls to come out, Mitch gave us an offering of super white tuna. and wow. Now Ive read reviews on here about the quality and freshness of the sushi here at Toro...and let me tell you, they definitely live up to the hype. I havent had sushi this fresh since my last trip to California. It literally tastes like they just caught it and served it up to you. The super white tuna was just a preview for things to come. The Kamikaze roll has a powerful punch of flavor, but not so much you feel like your nostrils are being cleared out. Best of both worlds features both salmon and super white tuna on half of the pieces respectively. The 3 amigos had me do a double take, since the rolls were pretty big and there was a side of guacamole! But it worked for me. By far the favorite of the night though, Southern Gals. I dont remember what was even in this, but it was battered and deep fried then adorned with a sauce that made this specialty roll out of this world.  After finishing our meal (and polishing off a bottle of wine) we hadnt realized we were the 2nd to last party to leave the restaurant! Our server was very accomodating though and asked us to close out our tab and we were allowed to stay as long as we wanted.

Every roll is original. OMG, ""O"", and 3 amigos are among my favorites.  My most recent visit, I sat at the sushi bar. This was a great experience and the sushi chef was very interactive with the bar patrons. After our meal the sushi chef (who i suspect is the owner) gave me a fresh plate of super white sashimi for the hell of it.

2010-09-08,1.0,"The reviews for this place is proof that either yelpers or Lincoln Parkers have no taste. My girlfriend and I have wandered past this place many times, intrigued by just how popular it seemed.  On the few random nights we inquired about a table, we were always told more the wait would be more than an hour; we'd go elsewhere. We stopped by 09/07 to find it busy but with a few tables open, so we made it our dining choice for the evening. We started with the veggie tempura and, since these things are in vogue at all the sushi places, we went with a few specialty rolls, assuming they'd be creative, delicious and unique: a true representation of their offerings.  We went with the Awesome roll and another roll that featured jalapenos. The tempura was flavorless and sparse, as we were given maybe five pieces; expensive, for the $7 pricetag. The rolls were no better; the Awesome roll has a laundry list of ingredients but managed to be flavorless.  It was also topped with cooked fish, which the menu conveniently neglected to mention, and the rice and nori wrapping -- the ""roll"" part of it -- only covered half othe toppings, forming an upside-down ""U"" over the filling, making it difficult to eat without spilling everything out.  I paid $16 for this?   It was slightly after the halfway point on this roll when we received our accompaniament of wasabi and ginger, uselessly placed beside our half-eaten meal. The other roll was dusted with tempura and featured jalapenos and tuna, but was similarly flavorless. After our food arrived we never saw our waitress again, and had to grab someone to actually get the bill so we could leave. I would not return.  For even half the price there's much, much better in this city; for the same price you could go to a real gourmet sushi place and not just some fad that treats its patrons poorly.",0.9575,0.848,0.094,0.058,0.50625

Maybe I've just been with lamer, more prosaic sushi places in the past, but after you I think I'll have to raise my standards. Standards which only you can surpass. I decided to try this place after needing a change from my usual sushi joint, which as of late has become too pricey especially for the quality. After trying Toro, however, I'm surprised their rolls aren't pricier based on how amazing they are. My friend and I started out with the spicy tuna roll, which was  delicious and actually spicy. I've had many experiences in which the sushi chef would skimp on spice, but in this case I was pleasantly surprised to have to reach for my water glass once or twice. We decided to get a little more adventurous, and ordered two rolls which blew me away; the Oh My God roll and the Sunny roll. The Oh My God roll lives up to it's name. Piled high with eel, cucumber, salmon, eel sauce and sriracha, it is a surprising fusion of flavors. On the other hand the Sunny roll, which featured crab, avocado, and mango, was so sweet I don't know how anyone would want to turn it down. Every roll featured incredibly fresh fish. The service was exceptional considering the high volume of customers. While I am absolutely compelled to give the food 5/5 stars, the wait time was absolutely abysmal. It was so crowded, despite it being a weekday, that we waited nearly an hour for our table.

It was not that good in my opinion. We also got the Kamikaze roll and that was delicious. The spicy tuna mix was soo good. After the rolls we looked at the nigiri/sashimi section. We saw a decent variety reasonably priced. Uni was $8 and I thought that was a bit pricey. My eyes noticed the red bold writing on top that reads, ""2 pieces of nigiri or 3 pieces of sashimi"". Wait, so I get 2 pieces of uni at $4 a piece? We were so shocked! The quality of sushi was really good at a great price. The fish was served in hearty slices, but the shrimp was a bit small (Ama ebi and shrimp tempura). Also, the batter Toro uses to fry things - especially the ama ebi heads was not enjoyable.

Not worth the $14 price tag..not even for the miso soup option.

Portions were great. It was definitely crowded within 20 minutes of arriving.

Or maybe I am too much of a lush and the one bottle of wine per 2 people limit sucked the wind out of my sails. Whatever the reason, this will not be my go-to for sushi. Don't get me wrong. The service is great. Everyone is uber friendly. And the wait was not as long as I was prepared for. Granted, it was a Tuesday night after 8 pm, but I was honestly quite impressed. The let down (aside from my second bottle of vino that had to stay stowed away in my purse) was the sushi itself. As a veg I obviously am limited to a certain section of the menu, but can usually make it happen with what is offered. This was not the case. The veggies didn't taste too fresh, their Futo left something to be desired, and there was no tempura roll. Likewise, my boyfriend was under impressed by the ohmigod so i couldn't even chalk it up to my lack of food intake options.  All that said, I still want to say this place is worth trying. It is Vince Vaughn's favorite (so I hear). And so many seem to go crazy over it. So my recommendation is go on a weeknight. Call ahead to gauge how long the wait is. Prepare yourself for the one-bottle-per-two-people rule. And try to stay grounded after reading most of these reviews.

Extraordinarily fresh and creative, and you can't beat sitting at the sushi bar and having Mitch give you one of his signature fist bumps. The MJ and spicy tuna rolls are delicious, and the yellowtail piece that Mitch has given us both times we've gone.. heavenly. My concerns with Toro are around its general atmosphere and operations. We went on a Friday night and the wait was over an hour. Fine, I get it. So they took our cell number and we went down the street to grab a beer. By the time they called, the final member of our party still was not at the restaurant. So they put up a big stink about how they couldn't seat us without her, but eventually relented as long as we promised she was coming in 5-10 minutes. We figured once we sat, that whole question would be behind us, but the same hostess asked about her when she came over with our water: ""Is your friend coming soon?"" Dude, I told you, yes. I kindly ask you to deal with the fact that we live in a city with terrible public transportation. The wine/beer limit was new since I had last been here, and yes, it's terrifically tacky. I've never seen a BYOB joint impose limits on booze, and I wonder why they did so. I can imagine that they're gonna get some backlash on that. And the service is usually pretty slow and kind of testy. They have some smirky waitresses running around these parts, and don't plan on getting a check until your food has been finished for at least 15 minutes. All that said..

We ordered other rolls, but this one eclipsed them by far. A couple months later we went again, and sat at the sushi bar.  We excitedly ordered the ""O Roll"" again, as well as a few other things.

2010-04-14,2.0,"This place has me torn on how many stars to give it. On one hand it's not necessairly their fault that so many people enoy the food and are willing to wait a very long time for a table. On the other hand, they didn't show a lick of appreciation for our business, thus I won't be returning.  It was an unseasonably warm Friday night in April. Two couples decided to try to snag a table at Toro Sushi, which we'd heard only great things about. We got there at 6:30pm and were told it would be a 2 hour wait, at least. Since the place is tiny and BYOB we couldn't sit inside and have a few drinks, so we went elsewhere to wait.  A little OVER 2 hours later it was FINALLY our turn to be seated! Now it's approaching 9pm- we are a bit tipsy and a LOT bit hungry.  The place was still packed. We had BYOB'ed a bottle of wine and the guys each had a 6 pack of beer for the table. Little did we know when we had purchased our beverages (in the 6 o'clock hour) that they have a limit. For 2 people it's EITHER one bottle of wine OR one 6 pack of beer OR one sake bottle. Well no one told us that and we had two 6 packs of beer and one bottle of wine. I've actually never been to a BYOB restaurant with computer print-outs on the wall with an alcohol limit policy. It was a tad tacky. That probably should have been our first clue.  The waitress made a point of telling us she was making an exception for us as far as the alcohol allowance. I wanted to say I waited more than 2 hours for a stinkin table in your shoebox of a restaurant, I'll drink what I want. But I thanked her for her generousity and whispered to my friends that that would be coming out of her tip.  The food itself was really good. Not great (I still rank Coast Sushi as my all time fave- plus I've NEVER EVER waited as long for a table at Coast, and I've never EVER  been told I'm limited to one bottle of wine there).  I liked the sashimi sample platter the most and my next favorite was the volcano roll (it comes complete with sparklers!!) Very cool presentation.  We were seated about 1 hour- maybe just under an hour- when we were winding down our eating. We had just paid a $100 bill (and gave our waitress a very generous tip). My friends and I were eyeing the dessert at the next table and deciding if we wanted to order it or not.  That's about the time our WONDERFUL, TACTFUL waitress came by ans asked us to leave. Yes, SHE ASKED US TO LEAVE! She said she was nice enough to look the other way as far as the alcohol allowance but that she had other people needing a table and we need to leave. We told her we were not yet done with our drinks (and had been thinking about spending more money as well).  She came back a few minutes later again asking us to leave. We waited over 2 hours for a table and once we hit 1 hour it's time to boot us! I was enraged. One of the people at our table actually went as far as to threaten her with a poor yelp review. She didn't seem to care.  I was SO angry I was wishing we hadn't paid her at all yet. I'd have not tipped her. But she was smart enough to wait for the signed bill (tip and all) before trying to boot us.  The third time she asked us to leave we were all livid I think. At that point I was sitting there just despite her. There were other tables around us that had been seated at the same time we had been, some even before us and I didn't see anyone asking them to leave.  Additionally, I am ALWAYS sensitive to eating and leaving. I understand these people are in business to make money and that I'm not supposed to sit and hog a table for hours on end. I always get pissed off at places like Panera and Julius Meinl when people camp out for hours during peak times, oblivious or maybe just that ignorant that they don't care about others who are suffering through a long wait to be seated. I'm VERY tuned in to that.  HOWEVER I don't think it's unreasonable for 4 people on a Friday night who waited over 2 hours for a stinking table and who spend $100 on a meal to be seated for more than 1 hour. I truely don't think that's unreasonable. At All.  All in all I felt the waitress was so off her rocker and SO over the top rude. I have only had one other similar experience. At Chaise Lounge in Bucktown. (check my review of those clowns). And we spent $500 that night!  The service was above and beyond insulting and awful. And look where they are now- OUT OF BUSINESS!!!   So Toro Sushi- let that be a lesson. Good food alone won't keep you in business. Right now your popularity is a fad. If you don't step it up- you will be a fad that fizzles out. There are a million sushi reatsurants in this city. If the service is as terrible as what we experienced (and the wait time as absurd) you too will find yourselves OUT OF BUSINESS!  I will not be returning!

I suggested Toro because so many people love it and I figured I'd give it another go.  2 of the 3 of us get there at 6. They tell us it'll be about 45 minutes. We say fine and go down to Duke's for some martinis. 6:15 they call us and tell us our table is ready. I said ""well, one of us isn't here yet, so can you just skip over this round, we're fine with waiting another 30ish minutes, no problem!"" she says ""Ok sounds good!"" 30 minutes later she calls back and says there's room at the counter for us. I tell her we don't want a counter, we want a table. She says ""well we have a lot of groups of 4 we have to seat before you because you're only 3 so you should really just take the counter"" SERIOUSLY?!? You aren't seating us simply because we're 3 and not 4 person party? Are you kidding me?

Mitch has started taking Tuesdays off (he deserves it), he said he will probably go back to working Tuesdays when the weather starts to warm up but for now don't expect to see him on Tuesdays. Don't worry, the food is still just as delicious and the other chefs can fill in adequately but if you want to see the star of the show, he's not working Tuesdays for now. 3. Business has already started to ramp up after the typical restaurant slow season that is Jan/Feb. Friday and Saturday of this weekend they stopped adding names to the list before 8pm and they seat till 10. 1 of the waitresses mentioned most people put their names down starting around 6 because that's when they start to get busy and Mitch told me business is starting to pick back up so I don't expect this trend to get any better.

Because I think hundreds of reviews have already told you more than you need to know about the special rolls you will find at Toro and nowhere else, as well as the quality and freshness of the fish, let me just say this:  At most sushi restaurants, I find myself soaking expensive rolls of sushi in wasabi and soy, and maybe even putting a ginger slice directly on top of the roll itself.- and in effect, making all of them taste almost the same. After one bite at Toro, I knew I would not be using any soy or wasabi. The taste of the sushi itself was that good. I found myself using the ginger as was intended- to clear your palate before trying another roll.  Not cheap but not expensive either. The BYOB of course helps, although I wish I could get sake hear- I have no idea how to buy sake- anyone have any recommendations? I prefer warm... Best sushi I have ever eaten.

A few points to note before going, -Unless you are the first person there you will probably have a 45 minute wait.  The place is SMALL.  No big deal though because you can just give them your cell number and head a block down to Wine DOC (and they will hold your bottle of wine for you until your table is ready) -They put Cream Cheese in a lot of their rolls (I find this weird as I am more accustomed to authentic sushi, it must be a Chicago thing) but they will remove it if requested. -Favorite rolls:  ""Kamikaze"" ""Oh My God"" & the ""Sunny"" these are all HUGE rolls so come hungry.  Also try the seaweed salad, yummy! -It is CHEAP, our tab last night was only $15 each! -Mitch is the owner, if you are new there he will know it and usually send over a free appetizer :)",0.9861,0.792,0.183,0.025,0.604062362758015
2010-01-11,5.0,"Let me just say that I absolutely LOVE sushi !! So when it comes to sushi places I haven't tried before, I am real picky. However, Toro Sushi definitely suits my sushi eating needs. I found this place on Yelp and had read that this place was an all-you-can eat sushi place, but to my dismay, it turned out it wasn't ! I was completely disappointed at first, but when the rolls started piling out, they were soooo delicious that it didn't matter. When I got there, they had told us that there was a 30-45 minute wait, but they took our phone number, and surprisingly, I received a phone call from them just fifteen minutes later and ran back. My friend and I ordered the combination tempura, which wasn't anything too special. However, when our red dragon, catepillar, salmon crunch, and this crab roll came out, I knew I was in sushi heaven. Each roll had it's own uniqueness and special flavor. I promise you, I have had so many different kinds and gone to so many different places for sushi, and Toro Sushi has definitely gotten me hooked. It is definitely worth the wait. Besides, it is BYOB, how much better can this place get ?! Ohh yeah, it can. Because the fun wasn't over, we also ordered the tempura green tea ice cream drizzled in chocolate and powdered sugar. Mmmm..that was definitely the cherry on top to a fantastic dinner.

As we sat down Mitch (owner/chef) asked if we've been there before and names. He also, gave each of us fist bumps and even blew up his last fist bump with the last roomie.. Really cool guy!! Mitch gave us plenty of suggestions for sushi and cracked a ton of jokes.. Being a good sushi chef isn't all about the knifework although he does a fine job with that.. It's about how they can interact with the customers.. Mitch did that brilliantly even giving my roommate advice for his upcoming marriage..  The waitresses themselves were very much like ninja serving us the tofu and refilling our waters without us realizing what was happening.. Then again, Mitch was quite entertaining! As for the food.. well, you can't just get 5 stars on service alone! Here's what we got: AgeDashi Tofu - A gift to us from Mitch.. Really good broth. It was the second time I've had this and this was just phenomenal. The tofu had a almost gelatinous coating to it.. Soo delicious.. Kamikaze Roll - Jeebus.. All of us thought this was by far the standout item.. Really good spicy mayo with all the fish.. What made it so special though was the sunflower seeds.. The crunch and flavor of the sunflower seeds matched perfectly.. Genius I say! Oh My God and 'O' Roll - Two customer favorites per Mitch.. These were really good as well. They weren't standouts however. Saba/Superwhite Tuna/Salmon/Yellowtail Sashimi - This was where we could really see the freshness and quality of his fish. He has fish delivered 2-3 times a week and you can readily see that this is really premium stuff! What stood out for us was the saba. It was by far the best saba I've had and I get this everywhere! Even a roommate said this was excellent and he usually doesn't like mackeral! Really, all the pieces of fish were really good though! Hopefully, I'll be able to make it over again sometime soon..

2009-11-21,5.0,"Things to look for when sitting at the sushi counter: Friendly sushi chef who banters, jokes, and tells stories.  Check. Sushi chef who makes suggestions and gets to know you as a customer.  Check. Excellent quality nigiri sushi/sashimi pieces.  Check. Innovative rolls that awaken the palate from all you've had before.  Check. Mitch does a phenomenal job of making Toro Sushi by far one of the best places I've had sushi, not only in quality of the fish, but also in quality of the experience.  The excellent wait staff move like ninja's and take care of your every need while Mitch entertains you as you eat.  We had a variety of items including AgeDashi Tofu, O Roll, Oh My God Roll, Kamikaze Roll, Hamachi, Maguro, Saba, Sake, and Escolar. Standouts were: AgeDashi Tofu - Superbly flavorful broth, with a nice coating to the tofu.  Delish appetizer. Kamikaze Roll - The spicy mayo was mixed expertly, but what really stood out was addition of sunflower seeds.  Sunflower seeds you say?  The additional texture tied to the well managed flavor of the roll creates an eye opening experience you'll unlikely forget. Saba - I'm not a huge fan of mackerel overall (reminds me a bit of the fishoil supplements I took as a kid) however it seems I just haven't had good saba until now.  This was the best saba I've ever had.  Period. Verdict:  We were lucky enough to walk right in and have seats, so I can't comment on those who had to wait significantly to get access to star treatment and high quality food.  My experience was wonderful through and through.  And while the rolls are about evenly priced with most other places, the nigiri and sashimi are priced in 2's and 3's (as in $5 for two pieces of nigiri salmon or three pieces of sashimi salmon, your choice) so keep it in mind when placing your orders.  It's a much better deal than I had originally imagined. Keep up the phenomenal work Chef Mitch, and thank you for the excellent experience.  You've made three customers for life.  Have a great Thanksgiving on the west coast!

It was really good, if not slightly saltier than miso at some other places. But good. We ordered a few rolls and waited maybe 10-15 minutes before the food came. And when it did - woah. The first thing I thought was 'is there any rice under that fish?' The nigiri servings were generous (and 2 for $5 for the salmon. Awesome.) Fish quality was melt-in-your-mouth good. Every nigiri bite I had (unagi, hamachi, sake) had some fish left over that I had to take a second bite for. And the important thing was that I wanted to take the second bite. Really good quality. We ordered the 'oh my god' roll which I wasn't 100% sure about when ordering, but it ended up being really delicious. There was a 'red' something roll (red dragon?) that was like spicy tuna with more added, and that was good as well. And some other shrimp tempura roll that was good. I don't recall - we ordered three rolls and three nigiri and couldn't finish it all. Very generous portions, and you can't argue with the prices. I think we paid maybe $55 total.

2009-10-14,4.0,"Finally made it to Toro..and without a wait!  I finally got to see what the hubbub was about.   For starters, the nigiri sushi is Grrrrrrrrrrreat.  The nigiri pieces were sliced almost as large as Sushi Bistro (think, iPhone commercial) in SF, but I dare say they were tastier.  They were served chilled, not at room temperature (critical on my list).  And they were cheap...mostly $5 for two pieces (I think their menu pricing needs some updating) - I had the hamachi, salmon, and escolar.  $6 for amaebi, but (again, critical) served with fried shrimp head.  Not sure why unagi was priced a bit more though.  Uni is reasonable at $8/2 pcs though I did not sample.  Only complaint is that fish was not served with wasabi already on the rice, though the rice was nicely sized as well. The rolls menu was long (in alphabetical order!) and really offered something for everyone...from those odd people who like cream cheese with their fish, to lots of jalapeno (ew) options, tempura-based, and spicy options.  We had the red dragon, kamikaze, super white crunch, and spicy scallop rolls.  The spicy scallop was pretty underwhelming, but the rest were excellent.  I particularly like the fine tempura flakes on the super white crunch, which were done delicately and not clumsy and huge.  I must have mixed up too many spicy choices though b/c by the end my mouth was semi on fire and I wasn't getting the full flavor of fish. So all these good things, but why no 5 star? I think our waitress was busy on her iPhone at times and forgot to refill our tea after being asked.  And when we finished, there was a sense of wanting to herd us out for the next customers in line....factory processing.  ""Would you like some dessert or just the check"" doesn't really present an intimate environment to enjoy a meal.  But, the sushi is good...though not so good and not nearly cheap enough that I'd want to wait an hour.",0.9946,0.805,0.165,0.03,0.5265160765160767

They have a new liquor policy that limits the tables to a bottle of wine or 6-pack per 2 people which should help lessen the wait.

Toro's sushi was delicious, nicely composed, visually pleasing and had a super atmosphere to go along with it.  Unfortunately, their portion sizes left us seeking out more food down the street.  Actually, maybe it isn't such a bad thing... you'll have room for dessert.  Get some cupcakes three doors down.",0.9892,0.792,0.179,0.029,0.46685906685906686

So you can pretty much just walk around the neighborhood (which has a lot of shops and bars) until they're ready for you. Once you get inside, it's a pretty cozy atmosphere, not great for huge groups but fine for 3 or 4. Sitting at the bar is great, because you get to watch the chef prepare everything, and he'll probably even offer you a couple pieces free just to taste. He's also very cheerful and friendly. As for the rest of the service, they're friendly enough but oh-so slow. The sushi here is great, definitely the best I've ever had, but I have to warn you that I don't get out much for sushi. So it could be sub par, or Americanized, or whatever, but either way it tastes really good to me. I had the Oh My God, which a lot of people loved but wasn't my favorite.

Obviously there's a reason for the long wait and packed restaurant by 6pm and the reason lies with the chef, Mitch, The no corkage fee BYOB policy is also a plus. Although I wouldn't say the sushi is authentic because they don't even sell avocados in Japan, nonetheless put other fruit into a roll...oh the horror! Regardless, Mitch puts his heart and soul into his work and always plays around with new ideas for new rolls. Whether it's mango, rice paper instead of seaweed, sesame seeds, cheese or lettuce, Mitch always finds the perfect combination for all of his rolls resulting in an explosion of fresh fish along with the right amount of ingredients to pair with the freshness. The rice that goes along with the fish is also cooked so that when you place the piece in your mouth, rice doesn't fall out from either side...something that seems so simple but many sushi chefs have not yet mastered. Mitch is also extremely generous and treats returning customers with ""extras"" such as free dessert or extra tidbits of sushi. The waitresses are also pleasant to work with and are usually on top of things amidst the constant full house. Albeit, the tables may be a little too close together for comfort, but the reasonable prices make up for that.

2009-03-19,4.0,"You know when you see a product from a major fast food joint in another country and it's like a mutation of the original concept to appeal to local tastebuds? For example, burger buns made out of rice or pizza with potatoes and mayonnaise on top?  I bet the Japanese feel the same way about fusion sushi. It's like, ""Hey, this is our food, but...not really."" And if they should happen to walk into Toro Sushi, their reaction would probably be akin to our ""They have what in their McDonald's??""  The specialty rolls at Toro Sushi are stuffed with everything from mango to sunflower seeds. It was a bit too overwhelming for me - it took me forever to pick something out. I was afraid they would think I couldn't read. I ordered the red dragon roll, the Hiroshima roll, and the striped tiger roll (?) but I don't remember if it was actually called that. Yes, all for me, but as my nickname in middle school was ""Glutton,"" this is standard procedure. The red dragon roll was huge and yummy and really spicy, but it ruined my chances of flirting with the cute chef behind the sushi bar. (Have you tried guzzling water with your cheeks bursting with sushi you can't swallow? Uh huh). The Hiroshima roll was even worse (in a good way) - each piece was the size of a coaster. It was deep fried, the pieces half-submerged in a pool of tempura sauce (ohh yeah) but I had to nibble around the edges bit by bit until it fit in my mouth. The striped tiger roll was also good - it was the only one with recognizable amounts of salmon in it, although I got tired of chewing the sunflower seeds after awhile.  All three rolls were very good. I was expecting to drop a small fortune on them, but the bill (less than $30, I think) wasn't too bad. I came in at around 4:30 pm on a Sunday, and the place wasn't too full. The famous Mitch wasn't there, but I got something better (a free sample of fresh salmon sashimi with a small piece of goat cheese, which was possibly my favorite part of the entire meal. Like, cream cheese as a sushi ingredient is so totally over, like.) The waitress was really friendly and always made sure my water was filled. Would I go back? Probably not, but only because of preference, not experience. I like my rolls simple. I'm not for the over the top sushi implosions, where it's hard to make decisions because you like half the ingredients but don't like the other half. I don't even remember what was in the sushi I ate. My absolute favorite ingredient is salmon, and it was hard to find something where salmon was a main component, and not just a little piece fighting for space with everything else. (My dream roll would have tons of salmon...broiled, half-broiled, raw, smoked, spicy, ikura, I don't care). But if you're adventurous with sushi and open to original and creative rolls, you might like this place. If we could do half stars, this would be a 4.5 A note about Toro Sushi as a date destination, especially for women: unless you a) can put your fist in your mouth or b) are sure your partner loves you unconditionally, don't even try to eat a piece of a specialty roll in one go. You might as well just dunk your face in your bowl of soy sauce before even placing your order and get the 'sloppy eater' label over and done with.",0.9982,0.796,0.173,0.032,0.5407916784070629

I've been there a number of times and have always found the fish to be fresh and the prices reasonable.  Now, the single drawback to Toro is their seating policy.  Not taking reservations and instead relying on a first come, first served list is troublesome.  They do offer to take your cell phone number and call you when you name comes up, but on several occasions their time estimates were COMPLETE NONSENSE.  In fact, one time they told me the wait would be an hour and half, and they ended up calling me 20 minutes later.  This is super annoying if you and some friends have just settled into a drink at Duke's down the street when you get a call from Toro telling  you that they are going to give away your table if you don't march your ass over there immediately and claim you table. Other than that the food is good, prices are reasonable, and the BYO element rocks!

2009-02-06,2.0,"I thought I would give Toro a chance because my friend kept raving about it. I would prefer a place that's a little more low key and not so packed all the time. She told me it was packed for a reason. First off, when you walk in the door, you're lucky to be greeted within five minutes. Usually you're just ignored.  Once you put your name in, it's usually an hour no matter what day of the week. This is usually a good sign. We waited the hour and had a glass of wine at D.O.C.  However when we got back to the restaurant and sat down, we were ignored for close to 10 minutes. I'm a server and this is simply unacceptable. I find myself to be very easy to serve (just as long as you acknowledge me!) It's not that hard to tell me, ""Hey how are you? I'm really busy at the minute but I will be right with you!"" Done and done. This was not done.  This place is  a B.Y.O.B so we had a bottle of white sitting on the table. It would have really been nice if they could have at least brought some glasses over so we could get a little sauced while waiting. That did not happen either.  When I finally grabbed the waitress, she looked at me like I was bothering her. I said ""We have been sitting here for about 10 minutes and we have not been greeted. Can we have at least a bottle opener and some glasses?"" She then threw a bottle opener on the table, said nothing and didn't come back with the wine glasses until about 5 minutes later.  If it weren't for my friend, I would have walked out right then and there. I understand, you are busy, but just tell me that. Show me some respect so I don't walk out. I really wanted to try the rolls my friend was raving about so I stuck it out. Needless to say, the rolls were mediocre and they didn't even have mochi in the end.  I believe that service makes or breaks a restaurant. I dine out A LOT and if the food is ok, or if there is a mistake and the server makes up for it with kindness and attentiveness then I will come back a second time and give it another go. Not with this place. I was not impressed with Toro and will not be coming back. I really wish we had just gone to Ponzu down the street.",0.975,0.843,0.107,0.05,0.4345969089390142

Watching others order, I quickly figured out most were ordering one roll as their entire meal. The roll menu is gigantic. If you've eaten at sushi in Chicago, you know there are only so many traditional ingredients one can use to make rolls. Toro's rolls feature cute names for permutations of your standard Americanized rolls, Dragon being a key focus. Personally, I knew I was in a yuppie restaurant when I discovered an ""Oh My God"" roll which has to be one of the most irritating expressions of the North Side bimbo.  I ordered sushi and it wasn't up to Green Tea standards. Not bad by any means, but certainly not worth the wait. By the time we left, the place was a madhouse.

2009-01-13,5.0,"Toro Sushi is my favorite sushi restaurant in Chicago!  For a sushi restaurant to have fresh fish, it has to have high fish turnover, meaning it's a busy restaurant.  It doesn't get much busier than Toro, and the fish is definitely fresh.  Moreover, the pricing is reasonable.  The chef's choice sushi dinner was $15 (I think it's $18 now) and it doesn't have any octopus or squid! When Mitch is there, the atmosphere is friendly (though admittedly hectic given the limitations on space).  If you're at Toro at the right time, Mitch might send you a free appetizer.  He makes an effort to recognize repeat customers, and if you sit at the bar, he'll even carry conversation with you. You can't have to good without the bad though, and Toro has one major drawback.  Like all small but popular restaurants in Chicago, there is always a crowd and they don't take call-ins or reservations.  That means, if you don't get there early to put your name in, you might not be seated until after 9pm.  Carry-out isn't a solution either, because when Toro gets very busy, Mitch will cut carry-out service.   Many people get bent out of shape over how busy Toro is but you have to understand, there is a reason people are willing to wait so long to get in!",0.8706,0.885,0.085,0.029,0.5324943310657597

It was bigger than a coaster, so..who knows for sure. And based on the whitefish, it was good quality fish mashed up in there. Wish I could have tasted it more. It may just come down to your food philosophy, because I like simple foods prepared with a few quality ingredients, not a mash up of a billion things. And I don't think I should leave a sushi restaurant feeling ten pounds heavier. Next time I want to drop a pretty penny, I'll hit up Mirai.",0.9676,0.851,0.129,0.02,0.5056613756613757

As someone who is a little...ok very claustrophobic, the thought of eating at Toro gives me sweaty palms. There are maybe 10 two-tops?  Determined to at least try the sushi everyone is raving about I decided to get carryout tonight. Unfortunately (for me) there was an hour wait for carry out (7 pm on a Wednesday) because of a huge order they had just put out.  I ordered, went home, thought about sushi, folded laundry, thought about sushi, did the dishes, thought about sushi, checked facebook, and finally couldn't take it anymore, I walked back to Toro before they could call me to tell me my order was ready.  Three rolls and $22 later I was speed walking home ninja style, ready to beat the crap out of anyone who might come between me and my sushi. I got the Spicy Tuna, Philly, and Shrimp Tempura , totally boring, but also totally safe. That's just how I ""roll."" Excuse the lame humor, it has been a long night of starvation and anticipation.

This restaurant is like the typical American view of what Japanese food should taste like, and I say this as an Asian AMERICAN. We ordered the chef's special hoping for something exotic and unique... We got unimpressive sashimi and a California roll, basically. We also ordered a couple other rolls, including a Spider roll, which for some reason had what looked like minced imitation crab in it...

The decor is odd, but hardly noticeable as well. Its an interesting combination. The place is a VERY small shop, so you're often seated right at the door and always on top of another table. Forget about an intimate dining experience here -- its much better for a group of friends and their box of wine (which I have noticed here on several occasions).

I'm not a huge eel fan, but in small amounts I am fine with it.  Our final roll was the Spring Blossom which consisted of salmon, sunflowers seeds, mango, and was rolled in tempura crunchies.  This roll was delicious! The sunflowers seeds added a nice earthy flavor and a crunchy texture to the roll.  We had a bit of roll envy as we saw all of these monster rolls shuttled out to the servers.  I did feel that the menu was heavy with rolls with spicy mayo and eel sauce, but if all the rolls are delicious who cares?

However, I recently returned to dine in on a Wednesday night. We were (me and bf) their first diners that night, and upon entering, we were welcomed with a ""moshi moshi."" We ordered a yellow submarine, hiroshima, spider, and I think the fourth maki we got was called subzero or something like that. Well, let me first say that I love that they used real crab meat in the majority of the rolls we had. I think I only noticed fake crab meat in the hiroshima. Secondly, our bill came out to be like $53 total (after tax, minus tip), which is awesome! In addition to the makis, we also had the green mussels for an appetizer, which were good but nothing spectacular. It was covered in ""tiffany sauce,"" which I think is a combo of sriracha and something else--not sure though. I would describe it's flavor as spicy hot lol. The yellow submarine's main ingredients were salmon, mango, and avocado. I enjoyed it because it was very fresh and light. We followed that up with the spider. Now, the hiroshima. This is something I have never seen before. The maki came out in a saucer with it sitting in a liquid sauce. This maki is the crazy horse deep-fried. If I remember correctly, it also had tiffany sauce on top. I dont know what the liquid sauce was, but it was good. Not salty nor sweet, but it wasnt bland. Just cant describe the taste. Can only say it has flavor. For those who dont really eat raw fish, this would be something you should order, unless you dont like fried food. The hiroshima is something I definitely have never had anywhere else before. I was pretty content after the third roll, but I think I was being a glutton when I decided to order the fourth roll, the subzero. Just had to suffer myself to eat another roll of goodness.

Shout out to Annie T- I've had my exact same thoughts about if there was a fire in Toro...you're toast.  (only slight pun intended).  Just like everyone has said, Toro's seating area is about the size of my 1BD apartment and if you're going to have an intimate conversation be prepare to have about half a dozen people able to listen in. Needless to say, Toro is worth the hour+ wait everyone mentioned.  I've been going there for about 2.5 years it's been open and since their doors opened, it's been a massive wait.   The food is GREAT!  Every thing is uber fresh, tasty and looks fantastic.  Presentation is worth it for the price. Their staff is friendly but no smiles, they all look like they either just ran a marathon or are over worked.  If you get a chance to sit at the bar, do it.  It's fun to watch the artists at work and on more than one occasion they're make something fun for you on the house.   If you're willing to wait it out, Toro is a staple BYOB for those great ""cheap sushi"" nights you crave.   P.S.  Molly's Cupcakes opened up a few months ago and it's a great waiting place.  I chill out there with coffee and Connect Four.",0.9913,0.787,0.194,0.019,0.5173333333333332

2008-04-22,4.0,"Toro is as good as advertised.  There's great sushi to be had here and the people behind the restaurant are very friendly. Pros:   - Nice, small, intimate dining experience.  You can stretch your arms and knock over at least four people in the process.  You will definitely get to know your neighbors here. - The wait can be excruciating.  This is my second attempt at eating here.  When my friends and I came here for the first time, we were staring down at least an hour's worth of wait time and we thought we were being clever showing up late to avoid the rush.  Not so.  The trick is to come early. Why is this a positive?  I don't know why but I happen to enjoy places that are difficult to get into.  Call me masochistic. - Food is very good.  Either that or the other sushi places I've been eating at lately have been super awful (which can be the case).  I'm more of a spicy eater and the spicy tuna incarnations here are indeed spicy and very good. I wasn't too much thrilled w/ their special rolls, however.  I had the Volcano roll and while still good, I found nothing special to write about (and hence the short review). - Mitch (head chef) is cool as hell (+1).  I sat down by the bar and he introduced himself, asked me my name and generally made me feel like a regular right away.  The waitstaff is equally nice.  They check up on you regularly and make sure you're taken care of. Cons: - The place is SMALL.  Seriously small.  Well, ok, not so serious small but considering the fact that the entire neighborhood wants to eat here AT THE SAME TIME, it's seriously lacking in accommodation space. - It's constantly RAMMED.  I've passed by this place a lot of times and it's always filled to the teeth w/ people.  Yes, I did mention that I enjoyed places that are difficult to get a seat at but sometimes I just want to sit in, grab a quick meal and bounce.  Unless you come here before 6pm, that is not going to happen. - The special rolls (at least the Volcano) are a tad lacking the ""special"".  I'm not a fan of these wacky ""special"" sushi rolls where they mash up five different kinds of fish and then layer that w/ some eel sauce and odd slices of fruit (don't steal this idea - I patented this).  I'm more of a simple, ""let me taste the fish"" kind of a sushi guy. This doesn't mean that I won't give the other specials a try.  I will.  I'm just not holding my breath to be blown away by them is all.

Conveniently, they take your cell number and call you when your table is ready, so you can shop in the area or get drinks at a nearby bar while you wait. The sometimes obscenely long waits can get annoying, but the food makes it worth it. If you sit at the bar and become a familiar face, Mitch occasionally slips you some free sushi.

We've brought friends here, and family, and out-of-town guests who want to have a fun evening and great food.  Be warned, though: the wait is insane. The place is tiny, and ALWAYS packed, although once you start sampling the sushi, you realize why. We always come in early, put our names down (the wait's usually atleast an hour to an hour and a half), and plan something else for a while before heading back with a couple of bottles of wine.  I'm a maki roll person, so will speak only to what I know: they're amazing! The chef has made us stuff that's not on the menu - you can basically tell them what kind of stuff you'd like in your rolls, and they'll happily accomodate you. But seriously, the available choices are so fantastic, you're sure to find things you like. My personal favorites: the sunny (crab, avacado, mango, sunflower seeds - mmm!!), Omigod, and dragon rolls.  My only problem with recommending this place is that it's going to be even more packed next time. But that's a risk I'm willing to take.",0.9838,0.779,0.173,0.048,0.5930224867724868

It truly is a 45min-2hr wait at this place, but there are nice perks that you can come in and leave your name and number and they'll call you when your table is ready. But is it worth the wait? Yes and No. I eat a LOT of sushi and find sushi very delicious. However, after traversing many sushi places, I'll have to say that their sushi is very tasty (some of the rolls are really unique in flavor and have a lot of pow in your mouth - i liked the spicy tuna + awesome roll), BUT the fish isn't really that fresh. It tastes at least 1-2 days old.  Maybe it was just blip the first time I went, but it didn't have that fresh melt in your mouth sushi taste when it's fresh. Would I go back again? Probably only for the more cooked rolls, which is slightly disappointing as I like sashimi, but you know sometimes you only go with people who liked cooked stuff. What I ordered: Spicy Tuna Roll - Good flavor, nice & spicy finally! Crazy Horse Roll - boring as the description looks and fish wasn't fresh Awesome Roll - Very good, loved the seared blue cheese and of course can't go wrong with the soft shell crab in there Yellow Submarine - Liked the idea of the mango, but it was somewhat sour detracting from the flavor of the roll. Not a favorite. Oh, one more thing, if you love tofu - the Agedashi Tofu was VERY delicious and I would go back for more of that - for sure!",0.9956,0.664,0.248,0.088,0.6091414141414143

As patrons in the doorway wait for an open table (which can be upwards of 2 hours), they grow increasingly impatient and begin to encroach on your space and stare at you with disdain.

(if i had a cart...) they had so many specialty rolls named after people - are these real people? hey dan b. - is the spicy salmon with mango really your roll?  the only downside is that they dress a lot of their rolls with mayo - ug, come on! what's with the americanized rolls with mayo? i still believe that sushi chefs can make awesome rolls with flavor without mayoooonaise. i don't mind some rolls with it and with a small amount, but every freakin roll - lay off the mayo dude! before i end this review, i have to tell you a story that highlights the downside of dining in a shoebox: a friend of mine came to toro with another couple and put their names in and left to grab a drink while they waited. they came back and we're told their table was almost ready, so they saddled up at the bar and waited for their table. another group of people that were waiting for their name to be called saw that my friend was about to get her table - he seemed territorial about it since he was hovering over the table that he thought was his and began to yell naughty words at my friend and her crew. they yelled back and mind you, since this place is the size of a dorm room, the entire restaurant was subjected to this debacle. the guy who used the f-word about as frequent as ""the"" was drinking a glass of red wine and as my friend's crew sat in his supposed table, he got fired up and threw his glass of wine across the restaurant, trying to hit them - aiming is a bitch because in-need-of-anger-management-homeboy hit an innocent bystander at another table square in the face and all over her outfit! she was covered and began to cry. hitler, didn't flinch and his buddies with him began to be nervous that he was associated with them and yelled at him.

Are you the same people who only order California rolls? I think you are. As Americans we're spoiled by vast amounts of space and large airy restaurants so that we can avoid other people as much as possible. If you've ever eaten anywhere in Japan, Toro is actually pretty comfortable. By American standards it can get a bit crowded and loud, but I feel that is simply part of the ambience. I went with a friend, we sat at the bar to chat with Mitch and watch the sushi being prepared. While service was on the slower side and the wait staff was quite busy, it wasn't rude at all. We weren't in any hurry, and it was quite nice chatting while we waited. We ordered a variety of items, from sashimi (the toro, the super white tuna, sake, and tako were all fantastic and beautifully presented) a couple of pieces of nigiri (I highly recommend their Uni, or sea urchin, which was buttery and flavorful). We also tried a couple of rolls which Mitch recommended- the kamikaze was notable for it's texture and flavor. I'm not usually one to eat maki, but it was very good. Even their gari (ginger- for cleansing the palate) was really moist and good- I wish I knew where they got it! Toro also offers real (or 'hon') wasabi (the green stuff is imitation- made with horseradish and food coloring), which you must try if you've never eaten it before. The sushi rice had a particularly good texture and flavor. This is vastly important for good sushi- and Toro definitely lived up to that expectation. Mitch is delightful, and despite not being a Nihonjin himself, both greeted and thanked us in Japanese. The tab was very reasonable- under fifty dollars for the both of us before tip. We got a lot of food and left very full.

After being referred to Toro by a friend, I decided to check it out. I was glad I did.  At first it looked like a typical hole-in-the-wall sushi place, but the food and service make-up for the tight, cramped space. It has a great neighborhood feel and you can tell that most people there are regulars. That is of course for the people who don't expect the hour wait around dinner time. Although it is annoying because there isn't really anywhere to hang out, you can leave them your phone number and they will call you when your table is ready. Mitch, the owner and one of only two sushi chefs, has a special handshake and greets everyone. He is a great personality and I expect customers return to see him and his huge smile. The place is supposed to be expanding in November which is a plus. As far as the actual sushi/sashimi goes...I recommend always substituting the crab salad for the kani in rolls. Also, get the sesame soy paper instead of the seaweed. Mitch gets this having come from California himself. The super white tuna sashimi melts in your mouth. And the crazy horse, three musketeers, California twist and salad roll are my favorites. You can also bring your own wine.

The sushi chef is outrageously friendly and says hello to everyone and seems to know a lot of his customers. This place is generally casual and with a local feel. The downsides to this place:  Theres almost always a wait, unless you go very early evening.  Its trixie and chad hell in here. If you don't have blonde highligts and a designer bag, you'll stick out like a sore thumb. (However, it is in the heart of Lincoln Park, so what was I expecting?)  Parking generally stinks. Also, because its usually just the one guy making the sushi, the food can be slow once it gets busy - especially because they do a ton of take-out as well.  Its a good atmosphere and service is really nice, so being the odd brunette and being willing to hang out for a while for my sushi is ok. Its worth it. Yum. So good. Seriously. And totally reasonable pricing. 9/18/07 Update 11/7/07 Went here again with friends (one of whom is a very particular sushi eater) and it didn't disappoint.

Really good, thick, hot miso 3. Extremely fresh ikura 4. Great prices  For $39 we had: - Miso - Maguro sashimi - Ikura - Escolar (""Super White Tuna"" - But did you know Super White Tuna isn't really tuna and consuming too much leads to ""Oily Diarrhea and Anal Leakage""? Don't believe me?  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wh…   I don't care though.

I enjoyed the rolls, but honestly, I'd go again just to get sashimi and nigiri. I think that my affinity for maki stemmed from my inability to find fresh fish in the midwest. Now that I know Toro has the grade of fresh fish I've been craving, all filler cream cheeses and spicy tuna sauces just don't seem as appealing. Advice: Please, if you don't care about watching sushi prepared, look at me funny because I'm really excited about salmon roe, or would rather talk about your nails and some dumb cute boy, please don't sit at the bar.

Only critique, would be that the food (sushi & rolls) comes out slow. Think they need another Sushi Chef to help. And, of course, Toro, is BYOB, which is always a plus in my book. Will definately be back.",0.9774,0.787,0.197,0.015,0.5801406926406926
2007-03-30,5.0,"This place has some of the best sushi I have had (and I lived in Seattle for 2 years). The rolls are great and inventive and the maki and nigiri are super fresh. The escolar is so good it almost makes me cry! The BYO is great and the prices are very reasonable. The service can be slow, but I am willing to deal with it for the great sushi! Update - I have been back here several times and it just keep s getting better. The escolar and egg are great, the hot finger roll is so yummy and has just the right amount of spice, and the MJ roll is huge and just awesome. I always order to much food because I want to have my favorites but I always try one new thing.  I also love that if they are running behind they send out a free appetizer. The food is worth the wait, but I think sending out something free even when you have not complained, is going above and beyond in service!",0.997,0.667,0.324,0.009,0.5620330859616574
2007-03-08,4.0,"I wish I could love this place, I really did.. BUT the service was SLOW, the food so-so.  I do give them the extra 1 star for their attempt to appease my hunger pang by offering my friend and I a fried salmon roll ""on the house"" for thier acknowledged slow service. The best roll we got that night was the Negi Hamachi (yellowtail + scallion), my absolute fav roll, but was not on par with that of Wakamono nor Cafe Blossom in my area on Broadway.  The other two rolls we had were the Spicy Tuna Crunch and the Spicy Scallop (which were both drenched by the spicy mayo).  They do a fun Volcano roll where they light up a sparkler and yell ""Volcano"" while bringing the sparkler plate to your table.  Oh, and it's BYOB.   I would only go back if I was craving sushi and in the area. **********UPDATE************************************ My update gives this place 1 add'l star to 4 stars.  I decided go give Toro another try (since I'd tried every roll 10x at Wakamono by this point).. However, I wasn't able to get a table until after 4 tries.  I recommend coming on a week night. If you're opting for a Thurs/Fri (which is essentially the weekend), I recommend arriving no later than 6pm.  This place is TINY (seats max 40) and they move slow, since it's only Mitch & his sidekick making sushi. I was FINALLY able to come here with the hubs, since we left work at 5pm sharp.  We were seated immediately, and tried the agedashi tofu  and stuffed shiitake mushrooms for beef for the apps.  The agedashi tofu was yummy and the skin was nicely fried, but the sauce was a tad bit salty, and not up to par as Sakura in Mount Prospect (gold standard for agedashi).. however, I was still very pleased, and it beat every other place in the city.  The shiitake mushrooms (unfortunately) was stuffed with beef and DEEP FRIED! Although unhealthy, it was tasty, but I wouldn't recommend it. We also ordered the hamachi and spicy scallop hand rolls - the seaweed they use here was so tasty and thick! And, the fish here is EXTREMELY fresh!!! I repeat EXTREMELY fresh.  We also had the rainbow roll (which unlike most other restaurants), was very clean tasting (not too saucy and full of junk to cover the un-freshbness of the fish), and everything tasted so fresh.  We also got the infamous OMG roll, and while not my usual favorite, it was prepared extremely well.  I could taste all the ingredients -- both separately and together as a holistic piece of sushi.  The mango, unagi, shrimp tempura worked beautifully together.  I also like the fact that their ginger is nicely flavored (I hate bland ginger). My one complaint (which is why I'm not giving it 5) is the mediocre (almost borderline not good) service and the cramped-ness.  I understand Mitch doesn't want to expand since he wants to stay close to his sushi, but there is something to be said about eating while there's a hoard of 20 ppl hovering over you. Oh well, you can't have it all -- I'll take Toro's good prices and BYOB-ness, and of course, good/fresh sushi!!!",0.9966,0.803,0.152,0.045,0.5608666666666667

We had the OMG roll which was out of this world, a spicy scallop roll and I had some tuna and unagi nigiri. The tuna melted in my mouth, it was so fresh and perfect, and the slices were large. Then I had skinless unagi, as I think the skin makes it chewy and there is something about the texture that makes my mouth not so happy. As we were finishing up, Mitch, the sushi chef realized that we were new to the place. He asked us what our likes and dislikes were and then made some recommendations for the next time. I was really impressed at his work ethic - he is able to make beautiful sushi at a machine like pace and have time to meet and greet new and old clients. I think he has mastered the way to have a successful business. Another good thing is that they serve toro when in season, which in my experiences so far has been relatively hard to find in Chicago. I will definitely be back! FYI:  When we arrived seats at the sushi bar were opening up, so we didnt have to wait, but shortly after we arrived at around 7 on a Friday it got pretty crowded.",0.9612,0.861,0.117,0.022,0.6133857370699476

The chef has traveled to many countries, and he got all sorts of crazy ideas to coordinate into his sushi creation. I think the service here is pretty good compared to what you get in a typical Asian restaurant. (I just think that food comes first in rating a restaurant) The chef is also very personable.

Little secrets like this rarely stay secret for long, and even under stellar management a tiny (and newly popular) space like this might struggle on a busy night .  And if the management is less-than-stellar?  Uh-oh.   We went this Saturday, fully expecting a bit of a wait and a bit of chaos.  What we got was a 20 minute stall--3 empty tables sitting before us--while the hostess discussed an upcoming dinner party with a man who'd walked in after us.  Certainly this chat could have been rescheduled for, I don't know, ANY OTHER HOUR instead of the week's absolute busiest.   Finally seated, we waited another 15 minutes and watched more and more guests stream in.  The waitresses looked very young and very green, and were setting up tables assembly-line style:  first the napkins, then the silverware, etc.  This is of course the WORST approach to a dinner rush because everyone orders at once, effectively flooding the kitchen.  This would screw over the most well-staffed kitchen, but a single sushi chef?  A train wreck.    Over a half an hour into the deal--and still not having received water much less ordered our dinner--we gave up and hoofed it to another restaurant.  I'd rate Toro as one of the neighborhood's best weeknight sushi joints.  Just avoid it like 3-day-old sushi on the weekends.",0.9924,0.707,0.2,0.093,0.5620238095238096
