The padwoon sen's beef was dry and there were too many vegetables in it for my taste, but my boyfriend loved it. I did like the noodles though. I usually like to get the pad thai and a thai restaurant, but this one was too red/orange and that is not a sign of good pad thai (in my personal opinion).

My go to's are the Pad Thai Noodles, Pad Khee Mao, and any of their curries. All are very flavorful and very filling. Their Crag Rangoon is some of the best I have ever had and their vegetable rolls have an interesting flavor. I also enjoy their smoothies as well.  The only reason that this is a 4 and not a 5 is because this place is cash only. There have been numerous times that I have not come here due to that sole reason. This place is always packed so I'm sure the cash only thing isn't too big of a deal for them and helps them save money.

I ordered delivery, which arrived faster than quoted, always a plus. I was nervous to try the more authentic dishes at a new spot, so I played it safe with a popular dish- orange chicken (mild spice), and pineapple fried rice with chicken.  The pineapple rice was...fine. There was a smattering of pepper thrown on top, as if the cook realized they forgot to season it right before throwing the lid on. Overall, it was pretty bland, and most of the cashews were burned to a crisp. On the upside, there was a generous portion of white meat chicken in the dish.. no mystery shapes that have you guessing which part of the chicken it came from. My first bite of the orange chicken, however, was the opposite experience. Completely inedible fat and bone, along with that ""mystery meat"" look about it (shudders). On top of that, I ordered mild spice to balance out the sweetness, and it arrived with some sort of watery orange marmalade sauce that not even a few drops of sriracha could salvage.

Very busy in terms of decors.  We ordered our own entrees and shared an order of crab rangoon and the Sriracha spicy fries. The crab rangoon was meh..a bit too doughy for my liking. The fries were hot and fresh and decent. My order of the chicken pad woonsen was okay..nothing amazing. The rest of my party liked their food but again..nothing too special about this place. I would recommend going about 5 minutes down the street to Krung Thep for thai food. Our bill came out to about $60 (before tip) and we tried to pay with a credit card but the waiter asked for cash. We guessed that it was cash only restaurant..which is fine but we did not see any signs. And when I checked out Yelp later..it did say that they do accept credit card. So I am a bit confused about this incident. Overall, I probably won't come back just because I wasn't too impressed with the food.

I tried another trying to figure out what it was because I thought it was a pear, but it wasn't. So I picked it out and made my friend try it and he said it was pineapple. I am ALLERGIC to pineapple.

Cody noodles goes beyond customer service. They treat you like a guest visiting their home. You can tell right off the bat when you walk in, that they are so welcoming with big smiles on their faces. You really can't beat that.  The only thing I would like to add is that Yelp has them as they accept credit cards and I was not prepared to pay cash.

But I think this was my misunderstanding of the dish and wanting to try something new.  The appetizer sampler was great and our 3 year olds loved it and the pad thai, the other was too spicy for them.  The app sampler traveled well the short drive home and were still crispy.  I will definitely order there again and keep trying things.  It's inexpensive, big portions, local, and family owned.

Due to the size, we were pretty sure we'd have to wait out in the cold for a table to open up at 7 pm on a Saturday but we only had to wait a few minutes before being seated. My boyfriend ordered the battered and fried chicken wings and the one I tasted was delicious. Like southern-style fried chicken. He loved the sweet and spicy sauce that came with them as well.  I got the pad khee mao with tofu (~$10) which was spicy and delicious. I asked for slightly less spicy than normal and it was still pretty spicy although definitely not too much so. I loved the thick, wide noodles and the proportion of noodles to tofu to veggies was great. I actually could have gone for a bit more veggies but nothing to really complain about.  The only issue I had with this place is that we were literally rubbing elbows with the couple at the next table and found it uncomfortably difficult not to listen in on their conversation. Let's just say it was way too intimate for my tastes. Considering the size of the restaurant and that it was probably the busiest time of the week, close quarters are to be expected.",0.9935,0.781,0.194,0.025,0.6259856630824373

2016-10-24,5.0,"My husband and I have gone here 3 times and each time has been consistent. I accidently found this gem on Yelp when I was searching for Lad na, crispy on NYE in 2013. Located right near Wrigley Field, it definitely shows its appreciation for the Cubs. It is so cute inside! It's a small restaurant and had little & big collectibles throughout, even in the bathroom! From Elvis to Mario.  I love their cozy chicken, it comes out in a little basket, so fresh and the breading is perfect. It also comes with a small dipping of sweet & sour sauce. Their crab ragoon is pretty filling, unlike others I have tried that barely had any filling. My husband always gets their lad na. He tells me no one can ever come close to his mom's lad na and Cozy Noodles comes pretty close, that's impressive! The only con he didn't like about it, but didn't mind, was that it comes with regular broccoli instead of Chinese broccoli.  I've tried their pad thai with crispy noodles, this was a first and I was very happy I chose it. I'm used to it eating it with the regular thinner soft noodles. I have also tried their spicy curry panang noodles. It's like a curry broth over the crispy noodles. The broth is super creamy with the right amount of sweetness, saltiness, and spiciness. I love spicy, so I opted for it to be spicier. I was hoping to try their mango over rice dessert on our recent trip, but the server said it's a seasonal thing, so it wasn't available. Anywho, the owners and workers are very nice. They're Thai and I can tell they have regulars come in pretty often. The husband and wife are personable and their service is impeccable. Though I have been here 3 times already, the reason for my review was how the staff made it so memorable for us this past weekend. It was a hectic night due to the Cubs playing and winning that evening to make it to the world series.  The owner Mr. T? had a whole Cubs suit on that you couldn't miss from a mile away! It was a perfect outfit to wear that evening, he was definitely looking like a celebrity as everyone wanted a photo opt with him.  It's BYOB, so we had a couple beers with us and enjoyed watching the game. I mean, it was just the environment they set and everytime a great play came on, Mr. T hyped up the crowd.

Cozy is kitschy cute, and I can see it being a good option if you're in Wrigleyville and in a crunch and/or have a coupon on top of the already pretty inexpensive prices, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. Some random tidbits: CASH ONLY -- This is annoying. There is an atm inside the restaurant and a PNC atm right outside, but if you bank elsewhere and try to avoid atm fees, it's inconvenient. THE SPACE -- Like I said, cute/kitschy. Walls are lined with baseball bobbleheads and other curios. The restaurant is tiny and can get crowded; you might be able to hear other tables' conversations better than your own. WAIT TIME -- On a Saturday night around 7:30, about fifteen minutes for a table of five. FOOD -- It's all edible, but not great. I liked the crab rangoon and Thai iced tea. The edamame was flavorless, not even lightly salted. Skip it and get a frozen bag at Jewel to microwave. Trust me, it'll taste better. The pad thai was mediocre and so, so, so orange, almost as orange as my Thai iced tea.

2016-04-22,2.0,"Honestly, I have no idea how this place even has 4 stars. I eat a LOT of Thai food and I can honestly say it's the worst I have had in the city. I left there so disappointed and wondering if it was just another Wrigley restaurant that can get away with subpar food because of its location. Sadly this might be the case.  We had a Tom Kar and a Tom Yum soup to start. Tom Yum-  canned mushrooms and overall was just alright. Tom Kar was overwhelmingly coconuty, not your typical broth, the ends of the peas were yellow and mushy, broccoli heads were yellow...  Not the authentic and quality Thai food I am used to a getting in Chicago.  Edamame was just microwaved, did not have enough salt, was just bland. Not even hot enough to serve.  Vegetable spring rolls were very bland. Usually the sauce makes this appetizer great but ugh, it did nothing for me.  Pad Thai - Now I have high standards for pad Thai and if I try a new restaurant, this is typically what I order. It offered very little flavor, the same mushy beans, and greens that also seemed unfresh and a pile of peanuts on the side. I added Siracha just so it was palatable but needless to say, we did not finish anything we ordered.... And I really hate wasting food! Oh and the water tasted really gross like the ice was dirty or something.  In sum, although the feel might be cool and has a Wrigley theme, I will never come back here. I will stick to my faves, Noodles in the Pot and Aroy! Only giving two stars because the service was good.",-0.8207,0.81,0.084,0.106,0.5844649621212121

Either the left wall with all the robots, the right wall with tons of baseball paraphernalia, or for the adventure the restrooms(the ladies one I have been told has walls of jpez dispensers). It's like Toys R Us mixed with my childhood basement mixed with some Thai Food. Tried out that $1.99 Lunch Special Soup, their $5.99 Lunch Special Pad Thai w/mini Egg Rolls, and had a tasting of my friends Chicken Rama and Pad Khee Mao. Was a little bit let down by the Pad Thai, as the tamarind flavor and sweetness was a bit overwhelming. The Pad Khee Mao, from what I tasted, was actually pretty well balanced though I would have preferred a bit more spice.  Verdict: 3/5 for flavor, but 5/5 for value and quirkiness.

I was expecting something better for $8.  ANYWAYS, my friends got Curry, Chicken Fried Rice, and Pad See Ewe which all looked, smelled, and tasted 10 times better than my salad. The noodles and curry are Cozy's strong point, and anything else on the menu will not compare to them.

2015-11-03,3.0,This place was interesting to say the least. And not interesting like those friends of your friends that you don't like so you call interesting. This place is a good interesting but a lot of things on the menu are thugs that I would only care to have once.  For example they have crispy pad Thai. Most people would think this means some crispy chips on top of the pad Thai. But it's actually weirdly soggy yet crispy noodles that seem like the tortilla chips you get from Costco with great sauce on them and chicken. Like j said tastes great but I would say I only need it once.  That being said they have some classics on the menu that are great always like the pad see ewe or however one spells that. They also have some great mini egg rolls and crab rangoons.  The establishment is a little strange but in a fun eclectic way. The service was meh I think we have 3 different servers so we never knew who to ask questions to but it was definitely more of a positive experience than a negative one.,0.9921,0.661,0.255,0.084,0.6019762845849802
2015-10-31,1.0,I thought the food was terrible. The crispy pad Thai was not at all good. The sauce tasted like something out of a jar. The Tom Kha soup was basically coconut milk with mushrooms. It was super thick and had no flavor---clearly no galanga root or kefir lime leaves used in the broth. I'm also feeling sick after eating it.

They are now a cash-only dine-in service and only have a small sign notifying patrons that they have now made this recent change.

I gladly ordered that before taking in the sights with some of my buddies. The aesthetic in this resturaunt is incredible. As someone who is not incredibly into sports, I still really enjoyed the Chicago themed decor in Cozy. From the Blackhawks table we enjoyed our meal at to the cubs merchandise that covered the walls from floor to ceiling, this place knows how to stand out. My chicken soup was outstanding. Everything was cooked to perfection, and I definetly felt I got my money's worth. My friends enjoyed their meals as well. The rest of the menu seems delicious and I really want to go back and try some of the other Thai food here. The service was perfectly fine and we had no issues besides the fact that we were informed we have to pay in cash AFTER our meal was complete.

Overall too salty for me though. If they can make crispy pad kee mow this good, there's no doubt that the regular pad kee mow would be good too. Cozy wings - delicious! 5-6 small little wings/drumstick with an excellent crisp on the outside served with a delicious sauce.

The people next to us ordered at the exact same time. They got their food. Ten minutes pass. My friend got the curry she ordered. No mention of my meal. Ten more minutes pass. The waitress seems to realize I've been forgotten and walks into the kitchen. Five minutes pass. The couple next to us, who got there 20 minutes after us, gets their food. At this point one of the other patrons even pointed out that I had yet to receive my food. It's finally brought out and it is good. We go to pay. They don't accept credit cards for orders less than $10. For a restaurant that has most of their meals costing $8.25, that seems shady to me.

We asked our waitress if she could get something different or have it taken off the check, which I think is a reasonable question, you should never have to pay for food you don't eat due to not liking it at a restaurant you've never been to. The owner them came over and said that if you've never had the soup before you probably shouldn't get it, she didn't look at us when saying this, and then said ""fine I'll take it off"". She then came back with our entrees and asked my friend if she has had pad Thai before then commented that everyone does it differently so maybe don't order it, and asked her to make sure she liked, the way she went about it was extremely rude.

Tofu Satay- for anyone that is a vegetarian, or just want's tofu, this tofu satay is great. The tofu doesn't taste bland like some other tofu satays I've had. Shrimp Shumai- tastes great! Love the sauce they put on the side too.  Potstickers-they are fried not steamed, but still is great. The dipping sauce goes very well and the filling is delicious.  Spring Rolls- very fresh and you could say on the healthier side of things. Always a good choice. Salads: Cucumber Salad: The best cucumber salad hands down. I'm not sure what they do to make it so good, but I could eat a giant bowl of this if I wanted to.  Noodles: Pad Thai- nice orange color, tastes great! My favorite pad thai for sure. Pad See Ewe-Great dish! They sauce they use has the right balance of flavors. The noodles have a nice chew to them and it's probably my go-to dish. Curry: Mild Curry- this is a yellow mild curry and it is wonderful. It has a tiny bit of spice, but definitely mild.

I was excited to see a Thai place so close to where I was staying in Chicago. I ordered regular beef pad see ewe during my first visit and the dish was very underwhelming. The veggies weren't fresh, the beef was tough, and the noodles weren't seasoned well. I also ordered mango smoothie with tapioca. Bleck. The tapioca was nasty and the drink left a gritty film on my teeth after each sip.  I decided to give this place a second chance when my boyfriend visited and we were both craving Thai food. After reading several yelp reviews, we decided to go with crispy pad see ewe and crispy pad kee mao. Okay, totally not what we were expecting. The noodles were crispy to the point of almost being inedible. I think I burned more calories trying to chew the noodles than calories taken in from each bite. I noticed that crispy noodles are offered at almost all Thai restaurants here in Chicago. WHY?! This is not real Thai food. This might not even be food.

It is very small but has the most wonderful decoration (that starts in front of the restaurant with an Elvis statue and continues to the bathroom that is clustered with unique PETZ, sooo lovely). Some of the tables were made out of old sewing machines and had nice mosaic table tops.

The staff greeted me very warmly and made sure that there is a table ready for me asap. Generally, the staff was very friendly throughout my whole stay and even though they rushed it a little with the check in the end, I never felt rushed when I ate dinner; which is nice. And I understand why they brought me the check right away, there were more people waiting to get a table for dinner. As for the food, I had Thai Iced Tea which was very sweet and very good. My starter was Seaweed Salad, a decent portion that tasted like the one I am used to. Very great. My main dish was Noodles Panang with chicken and soft noodles instead of crispy noodles. The chicken was not quite my taste but I think this is due to personal preferences. Next time I would order my food with tofu. The portion sizes were decent and I definitely had enough to eat when leaving the place.  All in all I paid 20 dollars, including 22% of tips, which I think is a pretty sweet deal!

Each meal came with a small side. Shared an appetizer of potstickers before having the pad see ewe. Both were solid. The pad see ewe was very noodle heavy compared to the veggies but was a good lunch sized portion.

The space, so small no more than forty people can fit comfortably inside, will either tickle your fancy or assault your eyes. The decor is a kitschy amalgam of Elvis memorabilia, fifties Americana and walls lined with vintage toys. When I first entered the restaurant I expected hamburgers and hot dogs, the kind of food more in line with the restaurant's furnishings. It's all a bit confusing but don't let the look of Cozy Noodles & Rice stop you from enjoying their tasty food. When I lunched here today with a friend I only ordered appetizers: steamed pot stickers and chicken satay. Both were quite good, especially the pot stickers, which had been hand made. They were pillowy and quite satisfying. The satay sauce was balanced--not too thick, not too oily--and the chicken was cooked to perfection. The service, like the ambiance, was rather off-putting. Everyone who works here is committed to making sure customers have an enjoyable dining experience. To that end, the wait staff was a bit intrusive. They repeatedly asked if my friend and I liked where we were sitting and if the food was good. While I appreciate all the attention-- good customer service being harder and harder to find these days--the wait staff didn't have to try so hard.

Of course, I am not the only sentient being who enjoys Cozy Noodles. On a Friday night at 8pm, sans reservations (oops), I had to wait 10-15 minutes. However, within about five, I was seated! The space IS very small and it makes waiting there a bit awkward. The good news is that I didn't have to endure this for long. I went with two friends. We stayed almost two hours, and nowhere in that gab fest did any employees try to rush us out or anything (of course, there were empty tables near us as the night wore on, so I'm sure that helped). In terms of food, the tom yum soup is reliably spicy, and the cucumber salad is a great way to cool down. My friend swears by the crab rangoons but abstained this time around - if you are looking for that, though, you could do much worse than Cozy!  All sorts of people come here, and that's really a testament to Cozy's atmosphere, food, and maybe its BYOB status (no corkage fee).

The noodle dishes are pretty good and rather consistent, however.  We often order bubble tea from Cozy's (because we are obsessed with bubble tea) and about half the time they forget to give us straws. As a result we tend to pick up our order now instead of having it delivered because we've had too many missing parts and need to check it every time. The bubble tea itself, much like the curries, is some of the most watered down I've tried. It falls apart too easily, and turns to flavored milk/water in a hurry (either that or it's straight ice, it depends).  The inside, however, is really fun. Even just walking past Cozy it looks like a place you want to be in. The prices here are pretty good, the people are nice, and the lunch specials are killer. Although I would never pick Cozy's as my go to Thai place, on the occasions when I am out-voted I never come out of it terribly disappointed. I'll go back, but only because I live in a  democratic household.",0.9202,0.766,0.135,0.099,0.5659027777777779
2014-03-12,5.0,"Absolutely amazing.  Everything on the menu is both intriguing and delicious. I came here last night on a whim during a date with my girlfriend. I had been here a few years back during college and she was a newbie.  The first thing you notice is the decor. The walls are lined with nostalgia and kitsch. If you go to the women's bathroom, they've lined the walls with pez and it's awesome. One thing I remember from college was coming here and the men's bathroom featuring tons of old happy meal toys, many of which I remember having, sadly they've updated this and now the men's bathroom just has Marilyn Monroe plates...it was a major let down to rush to the bathroom and see that. I'm not sure why they did this but since the bathroom not having toys on the wall is my only complaint I'm letting it slide.  As for the food, it's nothing short of great. I don't remember what I got but it was great. My girl got the dish with Lard in the name, which usually would gross me out but I tried and I fell in love. We also tried there new wings and they were great too. They even came with a tiny American flag.  The service was fast and extremely friendly. I don't think we waited more than 15 minutes for our meals after sitting down.  Oh and the price is just right.

2014-03-10,3.0,"It's decent  When I lived in the area it was my go-to for Thai.  The flavor is always good and has a great kick to it,  Defiantly worth trying out.  I did recently have a so/so experience. I ordered the crispy Panang Noodle, at most places that offer this dish the noodle is fried in the sauce to the point to where the edges get nice and chewy/crispy but this place basically just gives you hard fried noodle pieces.  I mean it's still good but it makes it hard to eat and the fried pieces make the dish a little heavier than I prefer. Also there were about 4 tiny pieces of chicken in the entire thing.  Royal Thai are the kings of this dish.  Anyway, overall I like these guys.

I messaged them on facebook and have not heard back.  I ordered from work for the first time and my order was promised in 45-60 minutes. At the 45 minute mark, they called and told me that since I was out of their delivery zone, I had to actually wait 2 more hours! I was taken aback, and after offering 1 hour more, I thought fine since if I order from somewhere else I'd have to wait an hour anyways.  My food ended up being delivered about 2 hours after I originally placed it. Not only did they not apologize or were even slightly apologetic after telling me that I had to wait another hour, they ran my card for $1 more for the extra fee for being out of their delivery zone. In addition, I found out that I was a mere 2 blocks outside of their delivery zone.

I mean, come on! Most of the entrees are under $10. If you want to take a potential ladyfriend here, you wouldn't be investing much money into her. The food is also not bad for what you're getting. It's, dare I say it-- good! It's not traditional Thai food, but it does the job and feels even better knowing that your meal will probably be less than $20 for the two of you. Try their specials: I usually get the crispy pad see ew, but I've been known to stray from the path sometimes.  The appetizers here are smaller portions, but you don't really need to eat them. A majority of them are a miss. Go for the entrees and share.  The decor is a bit kitschy, but that's the charm of this place. If you're in for an informal dinner date, I'd take them here simply because it's so cheap and it's a casual spot to meet someone.  All in all, I really like this place.

Tom Yum Soup - Not great, but not as bad as the spring rolls, though that's not saying a whole lot. Pad See Ewe - I often order pad see ewe at Thai restaurants I haven't been to because it's hard to make badly. Somehow, Cozy has won the prize for some of the worst pad see ewe I've had. It was peppery and lacked the distinct pad see ewe flavor. Crazy Noodles - I don't know what this is supposed to be like so it was edible. Definitely lacking in flavor though. Garlic Chicken Noodles - Again, lacking in flavor.  I love how unique and fun the restaurant and it's menu is, but I just can't justify wasting any more meals on seriously subpar Thai food.

Cozy has unfortunately been the least impressive of the 6 or so Thai restaurants in the area that I have explored so far.  Tasteless. The only feedback I can provide. It just didn't taste like much. It wasn't gross, or terrible, or somehow inedible. It was just lacking in flavor, spice, anything identifying the dish as something besides noodles in oil. I ordered the Basil Chicken and Pad See Ew, Basil chicken is usually fairly flavorful while wide noodles are usually more mild. But both tasted boring and underflavored.

I have very rarely experienced such value for money anywhere in this country and i was really shocked to find this place in chicago.  This by no means the best thai food we have had, but the awesome service which has BYOB along with the beautiful afternoon did make it a beautiful meal. The waitress gave us our waters and wine glasses without even having to ask for them as she noticed us bringing it in. an ice bucket followed and the orders were taken. On weekdays they have a lot of options on lunch speicals and all of them are under 5.99 and the cheapest one being 1.99 along with a side of salad or spring roll. its just mind blowing. i ordered the pad kee mao and my wife ordered the cashew curry. both were pretty flavorful. I must also mention the quirky and really one of a kind decoration i have seen in any restaurant. One incident which really caught my attention during our meal was when the owner of the restaurant rushed across the street with bottles of water when he saw two elderly homeless people crossing the road, handed it to them and just walked back.  I had to mention that because you will sense that kindness and feeling of being welcomed by the waitresses that serve here.

We came in pretty early for a Saturday evening and got a table within a couple of minutes.  Unfortunately, it was the table right in front of the door - if you're seated there, ask to be moved.  Any time someone comes in or goes out, if they don't pull the door shut, you're going to get a draft.  And in the middle of winter, that is not a good thing.  We, of course, did not realize this until it was too late, so we were stuck. With regard to service, it was just ok.  We had to get our server's attention to take our order after we'd been waiting with closed menus for at least 10 minutes.  After that, two of our meals came out and the third followed 5 - 7 minutes later.  Kind of odd on the timing.  Also, we were never asked if everything was ok or if we needed anything else.  At this point, it got a little busier but I guess I don't think it was so busy that we couldn't have been checked on. As for the food, it was also just ok.  I tried the bbq beef with rice that comes with broccoli and a ginger sauce.  Flavor was not quite there on this one.  The beef was just ok but there wasn't a ton of it.  And it was hard to eat the giant florets of broccoli without a knife.  The other folks tried the crispy pad thai - kind of almost like nachos and yet not.  One of them liked the concept and the other did not - they both thought the sauce on the pad thai was way too sweet and it needed some spice to it.  So sort of disappointing in that regard. The portions are not huge but they are relatively fair for the price.  We have 3 entrees for just about $25.   The main thing I think people come here for is the decor.  Rock 'em sock 'em robots, signage, trains, a giant Mario and a giant Elvis, among tons of other things to look at here.  Sensory overload juuuust a bit for my taste.  There's a sign that says if you like something, it might be for sale so there is that.

I can't even begin to describe how much i love this pad thai. i dont ever get pad thai at thai restaurants because I find them to be too sweet. But the crispy pad thai is more savory than sweet for me. The noodles are CRISPY and gives the perfect crunch to balance the chicken. It's an experience in itself, GET IT you won't REGRET IT! Pad See Ewe (Beef): There is a crispy option for this, but if you're like me, I can get bored of the same foods and textures easily, so I get this in the normal soft noodle version. So very bomb dot com. It's like beef broccoli with thick noodles, which i love. I really enjoy the contrast between the crispy nature of the pad thai and the softness of this pad see ewe.  What sets Cozy Noodle and Rice apart from other thai restaurants is their crispy pad thai, so if you have to choose one, get that one!

We recived no apology and we were informed that if we wanted to send it back that it would take 30 mins. It took 40 and everyone else was done eating and ready to go before my dad even got his dish. Again no apology or discount. I held my tongue and swore to never return. I gave in and ordered delivery( I live about a 10 min walk away and was feeling lazy).

After over an hour wait I received a phone call from the delivery guy who was very apologetic for the wait, but said the meal would be here soon. Great! Fine no harm no foul, I am okay with that, long wait with an apology I cannot complain. However they brought us the wrong items. When I called back I received no apology and was told it would take 45-50 mins to get another  delivery. Again implying we should just keep the wrong items. I told the lady that would be fine. It took over and hour and a half. I called to tell them just to refund my credit card and forget it. Cozy's has seemed to forget there reason they are here. To serve their customers the meals they pay for with a smile. I have to say that living in the city offers an assortment of different foods and business should appreciate their customers. A simple apology and we will get your items to you as soon as we can would have been fine, but now this being the second time I will not be going here again. The food is average, what kept us here was the staff and the ambiance. See you later Cozy's I wish you could have held up to our small standards.",-0.6377,0.784,0.109,0.106,0.48568594104308405

I had previously been less than impressed with an order of golden noodles. I found the dish bland, soggy (the noodles had been overcooked), and severely lacking in both vegetables and chicken. The crab rangoon tasted...off, so I couldn't bring myself to eat them. On this, my most recent attempt at ordering from Cozy, I chose the pad kee mao, and it was much better. The noodle dish had a good spicy kick to it and came with a generous amount of vegetables (though the vegetables were a little overcooked, especially the carrots) and chicken. The orders mini egg rolls that our group shared were very flavorful, but they were also incredibly soggy.

We ordered veggie eggrolls, fried pad thai, a cucumber salad, and the mixed veggie noodles. Veggie eggrolls were pretty good. Small serving, but tasty. The fried pad thai was covered in chicken per the bf's order, so I can only speak to the small non-meat bite I got, which was alright. Why pad thai needs to be fried is still a mystery to me, but he enjoyed it. So, there's an audience for it at least.  Trouble started with the cucumber salad which was diced cucumber in a Styrofoam cup... and that's all. No dressing whatsoever. I didn't plan on spending $3 on a bite of cucumber in this lifetime, but ok. The veggie noodles were just sad. Somehow my order of ""mixed veggie noodles with tofu,"" which was supposed to be served with wide noodles in a garlic gravy became thin noodles with a broth on the side. Huh? Checking the receipt, they actually rang up some veggie soup thing, not my noodle dish. I understand that mistakes happen, but: 1) I ordered on Grubhub and clicked the exact thing I wanted 2) The $7.75 soup I was charged for ISN'T ON THE MENU! They made up some bland entree dish for some reason -- through a computer glitch or general hatred of veggies, I don't know. But even with significant doctoring efforts with various condiments from the fridge, the best the soup got was ""meh.""

The staff is incredibly friendly with smiles and ""thank you's"", although for some staffers English is clearly not their first language.  That's ok with me, as it is indicative of the authenticity of the place.  Just keeping it real 6000 miles from Bangkok. Cozy has a cool take on spring rolls.  They are slightly doughy and delicate at the same time, filled with fresh and tasty fillings, cut like a Japanese roll, and drizzled with a sweet sauce and topped with a carrot curl for decoration.  Well played and Mmmmm. The chicken soup at $1.99 is easily worth three times that (but don't tell Cozy).  An ample amount of rice noodles shares the chicken broth with fresh, crispy broccoli, green beans, green onions, carrots and chunks of white meat chicken.  Good for the Thai soul!  Terrific! The pad see ewe is tasty wide noodles that are really delectable topped with chicken, broccoli and finished with a wonderfully light sauce.  No surprise Cozy calls this their most popular dish.  I like it spicy, and I ordered it that way, though they took me for your average American Thai food aficionado (spicy wimp).  Not spicy enough for me...  Next time I'll get it ""Thai Spicy"".

2012-02-22,5.0,"It really frustrates me when I read reviews and hear people talking about the service, or the fact that their reservations weren't ready when they got there, when the place that they're going is clearly not about that. Cozy Noodle is a hole-in-the-wall Thai place that specializes in getting your food out quick, hot, and tasting freaking delicious, not about seating your party promptly. I go here with my friends, boyfriend, everyone...it has something everyone will enjoy. My past favorites have included: Spicy Beef Salad, Pad Kee Mao, and Golden Noodles. Current favorite, and my boyfriend copies me every time: Red Curry. So deliciously coconut-y and creamy and spicy and...honestly I think I need to go to Cozy tonight.",0.9459,0.76,0.18,0.06,0.5722222222222223
2012-02-18,4.0,"What do I like about Cozy? Well...what's not to like? This place is great. I'll admit that if you take a look at our GrubHub orders, we are pretty consistent with what we get, so I can't comment on the whole menu. But, like I've said before, I'm a simple girl so a formula that works is always good in my book. And, this one works. First, if you eat in, the place is cute. The walls are filled top to bottom with funky little games of old.  With Pez dispensers, old tin toys, fire engines, and tables made from old sewing machine trestles, there is visual stimulation aplenty. Plus a nice little outdoor seating area in nice weather. The service is consistently pretty nice. And, every time we have ordered takeout (which is about once a week) they have delivered very fast. Of course, we live in the neighborhood so they don't have far to go. But still, we're happy. Now, as for the food...consistent, fresh and a solid value. The cucumber salad is a must in my book. Then we usually order the Chicken Satay with an extra side of the peanut sauce. The Chicken Satay pieces are HUGE! I have had this as a meal and had leftovers. They don't skimp on the quantities here. Hubby likes to get the Fried Rice extra spicy to satisfy his Texas tongue. Not me, I find that too hot, but they do put looks of good veggies in the fried rice an big pieces of meat. My main course usually alternates between the Beef and Broccoli and the Cashew Chicken, depending on my mood. Both are very good. I haven't  had anything else on the menu because even though I've thought of trying the other stuff, my tongue and tummy want the stuff I've had and loved so I never have room to order anything else. Bummer! Oh, and stop at the Whole Foods around the corner because the place is BYOB, babies!! That's right, bring your own beer or wine or whatever, they will supply the glasses and you don't have to pay restaurant markups on the booze. That really helps keep those already cheap Cozy bills down. Yay! Stop by after going to a game at Wrigley and bring your ticket stub and you get a discount!",0.9912,0.82,0.151,0.029,0.5776682539682539

Even thuogh the bathroom full of pez dispensers was pretty creepy, I enjoyed peeing while looking at all the different shapes and sizes and faces. And all the bobble heads lined up against the windows..I wondered how it would've been if there were an earthquake. Anyway...I saw the reviews on Yelp and decided to stop by after school since it's literally a minute away.  Beef salad. I asked for extra spicy. It was not spicy at all, rather it was overly sweet and lacked the tanginess of traditional beef salad. Also, the beef was so hard and dry that I couldn't even chew it. Spicy chicken fried rice. I heard they make their fried rice with brown rice so I was excited. HOLY SHIT were my hopes shot down.  It was so salty I cringed. Instead of making the fried rice with brown rice, I think they poured enough soy sauce on it to turn white rice into brown...it was that fucking salty. I had to wash every bite down with my beer, thank God they were BYOB. This was the furthest from Thai food I ever ate. And if there was such thing as sodium poisoning, I would have gotten it.

We got some hot tea, a cucumber salad, and Tom Yum soup  to start. The soup had vegetables and chicken in it but tasted like dead fish (mackerel I think).  It was so fishy it was inedible.  I am not sure where that flavor even came from.  Hopefully, not the chicken!   For the main course we got the Noodles Panang and Pad Woonsen.   The Panang was ok but the Pad Woonsen noodles were way over done and when I was near the end of the dish I almost chipped my tooth on a ROCK!

2012-02-06,5.0,"Cozy Noodle is, by far, the best delivery Thai food I've had in Chicago.  I'm eating it as I write this from my couch.  Fresh, authentic, consistent.  Fell in love with Cozy living in the neighborhood and going into the quaint, kitsch-filled dining room for 2 for 1 entree deals we found on our Jewel receipts and on delivery menus.  If you live in the hood, keep your eyes peeled for coupons -- they give out so many you will start to feel guilty for using them, I promise. The restaurant itself is tiny, tables are small, and the style of service is somewhere between traditional noodle shop and dinner at your friend's parent's house.  I have read other reviews talking about reservations and service... not really what you go here for.  My experiences have been all over the map, but maybe it's because I am a server I can overlook the failings by having reasonable expectations.  At least one person smiles at me every time I go in, the owners are very sweet and have remembered my boyfriend for years, and I'm not disappointed I can't have more in-depth conversation with my server.  More importantly, the food.... We are both guilty of ordering the same thing at Cozy for months at a time, if not longer.  Staple orders include, but are not limited to: -- Pad Khee Mao (delicious soft wide rice noodles, a lot of fresh vegetables, spicy! and I want it every day) -- Golden Noodles (we order spicy -- Cozy Noodle single-handedly converted me from heat-wimp to red chili flake lover) -- Broccoli Beef (light almost broth-like sauce with al dente broccoli, tender beef and LOTS of shaved fresh ginger root... awesome) -- Noodles Panang (creamy, lightly sweet curry with a hint of spice, menu dish comes with large crispy noodles that aren't great for delivery, so they happily replace them with soft rice noodles upon request) -- Tom Kar (spicy, perfectly done coconut milk base, I go mixed vegetables, so good) The curries are good too, milder and mellow.  Tom Yum soup, bright and refreshing and really good.  Only thing we usually skip are the appetizers.  The Crab Rangoon are the best I've ever had (though cream cheese belongs on bagels and not Asian food for me), but all the rest are golden fried, semi-bland sauce vessels for me.  And, of course, that sauce is excellent. Delivery is affordable, friendly, and fast (29 mins today!!), and I have yet to have an issue with my order.  Cozy Noodle is fresh, delicious, and healthier than ordering a pizza.  If I don't get my weekly Cozy fix, the cravings get out of hand!!  I love you, Cozy Noodles and Rice.",0.9979,0.785,0.187,0.028,0.6088504464285716

My main man and I have ordered delivery from Cozy twice now, both times with relatively quick, hot, deliveries.  They also always have coupons, from those mailer packets and from their menus - even if it's for something small, I always appreciate those coupons!  Their prices are fair to begin with, but adding a coupon results in even happier customers.  :-) Penny Noodles gets our undisputed #1 spot for chicken pad se eew; the #2 spot goes to Cozy!   (side note: why is it that every single restaurant spells pad se eew differently?  I have no idea what the correct spelling actually is.  Same goes for ""lad nar"" a.k.a. ""lard nar"" a.k.a. ""lad na"") Cozy also offers the 'crispy pad se eew' option.  Which, I think is just a tad too crispy, it's still pretty awesome.  Our most recent order, we mixed one standard pad-s.e. with one *crispy pad-s.e., and mixed and split them - and THAT was a good combo.   Have also tried the crab rangoon, which was great (one of the best I've ordered around here), and the shrimp potstickers (okay, but wouldn't have to have them again).   If their delivery is this good, I suspect their food would be even better in house - hopefully will try it there soon!",0.9931,0.781,0.196,0.023,0.5579506802721089

I ordered the crab rangoon, steamed potsticker, rice soup and wonton soup. I probably wouldn't have ordered that much food for one person, but there was a $15 minimum on delivery, and I always order more food than necessary. I def would have gotten a pad thai or something along those lines, but I had a sore throat and mainly needed soup, so I will venture out next time.  I then got a 15 or 20 % football discount off my whole bill (ordered through grubhub.) The crab rangoons=awesome!!! I'm definitely the worlds biggest crab rangoon fan, and these were great. Great flavor, great size, great dipping sauce which was different than my usual duck sauce. Potsticker= pretty good, but sort of bland as I usually find them to be, not really sure why I ordered them.....I think I was just hungry, or sick of a 3 day soup diet.

I don't think I could go to Cozy without having this dish.  Also got the crab rangoon, and the reviews were right!  It was awesome, and the sweet and sour sauce could have been the best part since it also has just the right amount of spiciness. The wonton soup was sooo good too, both the broth and shrimp wontons were very flavorful.  I will look forward to ordering this on a freezing day this winter.  In the past I have had the baby egg rolls, to me they are just okay, nothing special.  More than anything, they are just cute and tiny :-) I have eaten at the restaurant many times, got delivery once.  Their delivery was okay.  I placed an order at 11am on a Friday and it took over an hour to get to me, I was a little surprised about that.  But I would much rather it take a little longer and have fresh, well made food than get some junk delivered to me very quickly.   This is a great place, I recommend it 100% their food is a great non-greasy, well flavored Asian food option!  Oh and prices are very reasonable too (check website for lots of coupons).",0.9963,0.747,0.237,0.016,0.5702801120448179

The decor reminds me of Club Foot; there are toys and figurines everywhere; there are also an assortment of license plates and jewel-top sewing machine tables that serve as two-tops. It's kitschy, kooky and kreepy all at the same time (sorry, had to keep the alliteration going).  We picked the place based on location, but they do have a pretty stellar lunch special. For $5, you get a choice of three starters (cucumber salad, egg rolls and spring rolls) and one of six different noodle dishes. I opted for the cucumber salad and shrimp pad thai (shrimp is a few dollars extra).  The cucumber salad was good, but not what I expected. The cucumber was cut into little nuggets and seasoned with what tasted like some sort of vinaigrette. Service was efficient, almost too efficient, I got my entree before I had the chance to finish the salad.  So why 3.5 stars? Despite being new to Thai, I wasn't that impressed with my pad thai. The size and texture of the noodles surprised me. The noodles were wider than expected, they were the width of fettuccine as opposed to ones the width of linguine. The noodles were cooked al dente; I'm not sure whether this was intentional, but I didn't care for the firmer texture. While the portion was generous, the flavor fell flat with me.

They did not re-cook or discount, but instead had the driver wait for 25 minutes until I got home. Person on the phone, Julie, did not understand why I was frustrated.

Was it because we were the only Asians there? Strange. I also thought it was funny that they have a sign on their door that they welcome everyone, regardless of where they come from. Hmmm. I don't know what to make of that. My friend ordered the Pad Thai, which I've never found to be good anywhere else but here. It was actually not so out-of-the-world orangely and mushy! Score one for the Cozy! Based on our server's recommendation, I ordered the Crispy Khee Mao. It was wayyyyyyy too crispy. It hurt the roof of my mouth to try to eat this. Still, it was quite good, if not a little too salty for my taste.  We also ordered the tom kha gai soup to start with. That was good. I liked it, but I think I'd have preferred the tom yum soup. Dang. Perhaps another time.  I may actually try this restaurant again given that it's in my neighborhood... alone. They apparently cannot split checks.

It's a small place and was backed on a Tuesday night, so I sat outside. It was a little chilly, so the tables outside were open and I started with their special Cozy Rice Soup with tofu. It was a nice veggie broth with some pan-fried tofu and Jasmine Rice, scallions, etc. It was a pretty hefty-sized bowl and it was great, but lacked the spice I was looking for in Thai food, so I drizzled in some rooster sauce. Rice was slightly undercooked, I felt, though. Which is weird, because it must continue to cook a bit in the broth, right? Also, though I did get a larger portion than I expected, this soup wasn't all that filling. The Pad Thai (w/ beef) was really very flavorful. There was a lot of beef in the big portion and they didn't skimp on the peanuts. In fact, they gave me a little cup of crushed peanuts to add to my liking, so I was happy. Too many Pad Thais lack the texture when they skimp on peanuts. Noodles were cooked perfectly. However, also had to add some chili sauce. Where's the heat? Though the portions are big (enough Pad Thai to share, I'm sure, but I destroyed it) and quite tastey, I take one star off for undercooked rice and lack of spice.

TAC Quick and Spoon are up there, but *only* for eating in, not for delivery. Don't talk to me about Arun's unless you're taking me there. Mama's not made of money. Cozy is, of course, cozy, and cute as hell. The owners are nice, and the atmosphere is fun. None of this matters when I'm ordering delivery, unfortunately, and the food is nothing special. I can't tell the shrimp rolls from the baby egg rolls. The barbecue pork is a little chewy. The spring rolls don't taste like much. Maybe I've been spoiled by overly spiced Thai food. This just isn't cutting for me. I do like their crispy noodles. They travel better than regular noodles, for one. But they also seem to have more kick, and the contrast of the crisp and tender parts on the dish create an interest I find lacking in some of their other offerings. On the plus side, they're currently offering a coupon on Grubhub for 20% off delivery. So they've got that going for them.",0.6364,0.793,0.113,0.094,0.6131826506826505
2010-02-08,4.0,"I frickin' love this place. I go on an average of about twice a week, and rarely order anything but the Basil Leaves w/ chicken. Not to say that other things here aren't good --everything is good, very good-- but the basil chicken is one of the best Thai dishes I've ever had. Sweet, spicy, saucy, lean, full of a rainbow of fresh bell peppers, it would be great even as a vegetarian dish, but the chicken is what really makes it for me. I often find that chicken in Thai food can be dry, bland, and separate from the sauce/veg's. Not here- the chicken is ground to a perfect texture (it actually looks more like it has been tenderized with a sharp meat hammer) so that it soaks up the sauce and stays perfectly moist (maybe a mixture of dark and white meat?). Anyways, a killer dish. I also love the baby egg rolls- not overly breaded like many places and not overly greasy. Really tasty meat filling and a great spicy/sweet dipping sauce. On a last note, I will describe how awesome it can be to eat at Cozy: I went with 5 friends the other night. I brought one of the ""free entree with purchase over $16"" coupons that seem to litter the streets of Wrigleyville, and after two hours of great food and an unhealthy amount of delicious top-notch booze (it is byob, and everyone on a weekend seems to take advantage of it by bringing anything ranging from Belgium beer to Hypnotiq to Mickey's forties) our total came $38. That's for 6 people! After tip we were still paying about $8 per person for a delicious meal in a lively, fun environment with our hearts content of good beer and an attentive wait staff.  Because of pocketbook constraints, I might never eat out at another place! Cozy rules. But do me one favor- Don't buy your booze from the Eastern European gangbangers at Gold Crown- worst liquor store in Chicago. Their ''$50"" kegs actually cost about $200 when all is said and done; they are some of the most vile, unfriendly people running a business in Chicago; and their prices suck. There is a Binny's a few blocks down on Clark and a Jewel at Broadway and Addison.",0.9965,0.695,0.216,0.089,0.6119017094017093

I enjoy crisp noodles, not hard noodles, and these were painful to chew. Not cool. My other gripe is that in each of the 10+ times I have been here, our table never gets all of our entrees at once. Usually it only takes 3-5 minutes to get all the entrees out, but there were two times where my girlfriend and I had to wait over 20 minutes for one of our entrees. The worst part is that you have to go through the ""you should start eating your food!"" and the ""no, that's okay, I'll wait for you"" awkwardness that lasts until everybody finally gets their food.

2009-06-11,5.0,"First things first, whoever eats at Cozy Noodles and doesnt use a coupon (assuming you can spend at least $15), you are just dumb in my book and should leave Chicago. That is like going to Bed Bath and Beyond and not using a 20% off coupon. At some point it is a matter of principle. If you forgot your coupon, they have a box outside of the store with hundreds of them (they are on the takeout menu) and there are some by the cash register. So here is the deal, I dont officially know if Cozy is as good as it gets, to be honest. But it is pretty freaking awesome. You get a ton of food and enough for leftovers and usually cant spend more than $7 per person. I always get the chicken pad thai and it is always consistently delicious. The flavor is just incredible. How do you do it Cozy? I always bring people here and they always love it, no matter what they order. The ambiance, especially if you sit outside, is just great. It is so eclectic! I have tried the beef salad and it is very good.  Ok so the one thing I HATE about Cozy - They dont know how to split a check. Dont ask. They look at me like I have 9 heads, and I know they understand me, but they just wont do it. They also dont accept more than 2 forms of payment per table. Dont go in with 4 friends and expect to pay with 4 different cards. 2 people will be out of luck.  Oh yes and one more thing - If you have leftover and want to bring them home, DO NOT HAVE THEM DO IT.  They will try, but BE STRONG. Everytime they do it, I seem to lose half of my Pad Thai, which to be honest, I would push my mother down stairs for. I now ask for the box myself (always a hassle) and do it. Its worth the effort. GO INTO THE BATHROOMS! And for whichever gender you do not identify with, have someone else open the door so you can peek in. It is worth the creepiness.

I admit I was initially intrigued by the ""super fried"" options on the menu. Basically you can get any noodle dish with deep fried rice noodles instead of the usual pan fried noodles. I expected crispy noodles but instead they were just stiff and hard to chew, both times I tried ordering it.  This seems like a poorly executed attempt to make the dishes more enticing to an American palette (as to ""Americanize"" any ethnic food seems to mean to make it bigger and deep fried.) which doesn't enhance, but undermines the flavors and textures of the traditional dish.  So, D- for the noodle dishes, and only a C for the beef salad, yellow curry and tom yum soup which were all on the bland side.

Maybe he moved out by now but I swear every single time I eat here (going on 3 years) there is a man in the apartments across the street that leaves his shade open and does odd things in his apartment with very little clothing on. This is not the fault of the restaurant's, clearly, but dude, if you live across from Cozy and you're reading this and you're a white guy with a hairy back rocking the tighy whiteys, you might wanna draw the shades.

Last time I came here I had the Lard Na for the texture fusion between crunchiness and softness.  On that visit, the noodles were ultra salty, plah!  So much so that I felt like I were eating the formaldehyde they must have soaked all those spooky-ass Furbie toys in to last through all those years being nailed to the male washroom walls.  If the Lard Na is salty, I wouldn't like to try any other noodle dish as crunchy.  Maybe it has improved since then... This time I had my friend's recommendation of Garlic Chicken Noodles (egg noodles with bean sprouts, crushed peanuts, topped with garlic chicken).  It was tuly yummy and made up for that Crunchy Noodle disaster.

The only bad being that they sometimes get confused because it's not just ONE person per table. They tend to bring out one plate first, while the other plates in your party sometimes take another 10 or 15 minutes. One time, it took an HOUR for my boyfriend to get his dish after I got mine on a busy weekend night. That's an instance where it was pretty bad to have so many people serving you, because no one knew what was going on. Other than that though, I really do like this place. It's the best coconut curry I've had in Chicago. Almost perfect. Highly recommended. The pad thai is better than most for such a standard dish.

Well whatever, it's not splitting checks to equally pay out the bill from 2 debit cards. It's not that hard to figure out, and it makes for a huge inconvenience.

Make sure to visit the bathroom. The ladies room has pez dispensers nailed to the wall and the men's room is filled with action figures.  Don't worry the food is delicious and it has the same ridiculously cheap pricing that thai restaurants are known for. Need I tell you to order the pad see iew, or the fish cakes as an appetizer. No, we all have our favorite thai dishes that we always order, don't we?  So, why go here? If you're craving thai food anyway, why not enjoy it in fun, contemporary setting, that you and your friends wil remember?!",0.9671,0.83,0.131,0.04,0.5234953703703703

2006-07-10,5.0,"Toys, toys, toys and yummy Thai food!  What better combination is there?  I was sucked into Cozy when I saw my plastic SuperSaver circa 1982 chillin' in the window.  If it's good enough for SuperSaver, it's good enough for me.   I like bringing out-of-town guests to Cozy not only for their super low prices and great food, but for the sensory spectacle that makes this place so unique.  Sit at converted Singer sewing machine tables with mosaic tops, be distracted by all the cool old wind-up toys, robots and vintage radios, visit the Pez dispenser- and Barbie-covered bathrooms even if you don't have to use them and enjoy some very good Thai food.  Cozy has my vote for the #2 best crab rangoon in town, but has my favorite noodles panang--crispy wide rice noodles in a delish panang coconut curry with veggies and chicken (for me, at least).  Cozy also has bubble tea and while I am not exactly a big fan of it, I love encouraging my out-of-towners to try it, just to see their faces when they get that first glob of tapioca.  Hilarious. Cheap, delicious, entertaining (well, except for the Weather Channel running on the boob tube--so weird)--this place is fab.",0.996,0.695,0.269,0.036,0.6343333333333333
2006-04-24,5.0,"I can't describe how much I love this place. The only thing that kills me is that it's nowhere near where I live.  That, and my OTHER favorite Thai BYOB is closer than this one and I should show more ""neigborhood love"" by reviewing it first. The food here is great, I haven't ordered a bad dish yet and I'm at the point of  ""ordering at-random.""  And it's super cheap.  Crab Rangoon (though a standard yawner on an appatizer) is fantastic here.  All the Curry here is great, Panang being my fav.  But, I gotta go with the Pad Se Ew, in which they make the flat noodles ""crispy"" instead of the classic, er... ""floppy"" style. The decor is awesome.  Lots of antique toys displayed, old-school radios, those weird Zen-Cat Statues that wave at you incessantly.   The bathrooms take that idea about eight steps further.... I won't ruin it for you.  The tables are converted bejeweled sewing tables whose bead designs also appear on the bricks outfront on the dining patio.  And there are robots.  Yes, they're are tinny robots everywhere.  Oh, robots. Service is mind boggilingly fast (probably becuase of the capactiy of the restaurant), and the servers are just as friendly.  Too friendly infact -- as we were standing waiting for a table once I got in this one gentleman's way at least 8 times, and he kept apologizing to ME.  They also didn't ask us to leave when there were a few tables finishing their BYOB's even thought the place was pretty much closed. It can get pretty crowded during peak dinner hours, which sucks for me, but I get excited knowing this 'lil place is doing such good business.",0.9851,0.83,0.144,0.026,0.5722222222222223
2006-02-15,5.0,"Best Thai food I've ever had. Every dish is delicious, the crab rangoon is so good that it changed my life. The restaurnat is BYOB with no wine corking fee, which is freakin' awesome.  It's also super cheap. The only downside I can think of is that in the summer if you sit outside the L is right there so that's loud... but if your conversation gets drowned out its ok because all you'll be talking about is how great the food is.",0.9066,0.708,0.207,0.084,0.6155677655677655

2005-11-14,4.0,I love this Thai place! It's decorated very cute inside with tons of toys to look at. It's a very fun atmosphere. The food is relatively cheap and affordable too!  They had a really spicey chicken noodle dish I loved!,0.9506,0.669,0.331,0.0,0.6442857142857142
2005-11-03,4.0,"Went here recently for the first time and thought it was a lot of fun with delicious food and great atmosphere, the toys on the walls are a real kick! I thought the waitstaff was very friendly and unassuming. Only complaint I have is of the timing of the food preparation which left me with my entree while my girlfriend waited several more minutes for her's. Maybe they were sort of busy. Otherwise, go for some truly delicious food at this cool freakin restaurant.",0.9716,0.732,0.245,0.022,0.4755555555555555
2005-08-25,5.0,"This is the best Thai place in the city! ! They have an awesome lunch special, 11-3, which includes a main dish and a small appetizer, none are priced over $6. The walls are decorated with old collectible toys, and that bathrooms are covered as well. They usually mail out coupons for buy one get one free dinners too.",0.9515,0.75,0.25,0.0,0.5171957671957672
