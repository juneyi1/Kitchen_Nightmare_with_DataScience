Sure, it's blue collar Chicago-y, but it also has wafting smells of toilet water that are hard to ignore. And I gotta be real, it didn't seem all that different from just about any townie bar in Schaumburg. From the clientele to the terrible music they chose on the juke, to the super dark bar and dimly lit 80's type diner area, all I kept thinking was that this place seemed plucked right out of the suburbs and got a break with that early morning liquor license... because who doesn't love watching the sun come up over your final beer? Props are due to the easy peasy street parking sitch, the really friendly and on-point staff, the surprisingly decent craft beer selection they had, and it was nice that nobody made a face when my second and third round at the bar was a water. I could easily see where this would be a regular stop for locals, but a true slice of Chicago Americana? I don't know about that.  Also, there should be a law about how many times drunk girls can play Cyndi Lauper's 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun' in a row on the jukebox.

No. But it holds a special place in my heart, because every time I ended up there, it meant I had had a good long night of drinking and didn't want it to end. I'll list the strange things about Oakwood that lead me to like it in some kind of perverse way: it's really a diner. So at 4 AM, when it's packed full drunkies, you all hang out at the 80s fake wood diner tables and booths. But it's like the diner isn't really open. So you are actually hanging out in a closed 80s diner. You always see the same characters every time you come. Oakwood has dedicated regulars, and the same guys will hit on you over and over again. These same characters have no sense of  manners. On more than one occasion, my boyfriend and I were pestered and bothered. These guys don't care if you're with your boyfriend, which is pretty hysterical. On big nights out, like halloween weekend, this place is hopping at 4 AM. Peoples' costumes are barely in place, no one can create full sentences, and everyone becomes best friends when masked with beer goggles. This dive bar/diner thinks nothing is embarrassing. So solo-dancing to your jukebox tunes for five songs in a row is not frowned upon, or even given special attention. You WILL witness a passionate argument or fight outside the front doors. Now that I don't live down the street, I certainly won't be making trips to Oakwood.

2010-11-29,2.0,"By day, a casual dining restaurant - I have never eaten there. At night though, the Oakwood is an after hours bar. The punters usually show up at about 1 am and stay until at least 4 am.  During the after hours portion, The Oakwood transforms into the bar from the original Star Wars movie. The attentive bar staff quietly provides effective and satisfactory service to the scores of drunks who pack the place. The clientele during the after hours, is a diverse group spanning every age, race, socio-economic background and level of inebriation.  Bad music (selected by drunks from the juke box) typically blares overhead, but at a reasonable volume. Mostly, the drunks remain in their little groups of cohorts and things seem to remain fairly civil. During the day, many of the patrons are normal human beings, but eventually, if the cloud of drunkenness encompasses them enough, they will be drawn to The Oakwood at the end of the night - one of the few places where one can drink till 4 am in the Lincoln Square/Ravenswood area. Additionally, they tend to turn a blind eye towards behavior that might draw stares or get you thrown out of other establishments.  I've never seen a fight or anything too disturbing. Those who patronize tend to be able to handle their alcohol, but it is not uncommon to see pukers in front of the establishment, or see the terrible debris of defeat on the pavement outside, the next morning.  It seems that some use The Oakwood as a venue to attempt to pick up some company for the night...probably not difficult to do, as most of the people there are wasted, but no guarantees on the quality, coherence, or mental stability of the person you meet there...best to remain focused on your drinks and not to attempt to purvey talent (or lack thereof) from this establishment...you may get quite a bit more, or quite a bit less than you bargained for.

You have been drinking for a good 7-8 hours and want to top the evening off with a last dose of poor choices. I have experienced both. The first time, my then boyfriend (now fiancé) decided, way too early in the day, to go have a couple of drinks at the bar next door. We walked in to Oakwood and were, literally, the only people in there. The bartender was so, so nice. After finding out that we had recently moved to the city, and that I was a former teacher looking for employment, she tried to hook me up with a preschool job at the hospital where her daughter worked. I can't recall (that's what the Oakwood does to you) if I was supposed to come by and see her later regarding the job, or if I gave her my number for her daughter to call me, but either way I didn't get the job. I didn't get a lot of jobs last year.  The second time, we went out with my very good friend and her then boyfriend (now creepy ex). We went to Cesar's (not for the food, read my review) where we had just a few margarita's. Then we headed to L&L, before making the Brown Line trek back to the comfort of our 'hood. My friend and her guy went home, and Brandon and I decided to keep the night going. Knowing that Oakwood is a 6am bar, and that it was next door, we decided to head in. Long story short, we ended up downing multiple tequila shots with an authentic Mexican, before his lady came to take him home. She was angry. He was always out drinking, never home. I tried to console her, and I remember shouting "" I LOVE this girl"" numerous times, as I tend to do on nights like that night. Eventually the couple left, arguing, and Brandon and I had another drink or two before calling it a night. More like a morning, as it was probably 5am. Basically, Oakwood 83 is what it is.

Last Saturday? Did you see those two guys get in a fistfight? Well, that was me and my friend."" Haha. That's the Oakwood.",-0.4922,0.758,0.106,0.136,0.43916666666666665
2009-03-12,1.0,"True LAST resort bar.  To be honest, not sure how this place stays open....never seeing a soul in there 90% of the time....you draw your own conclusions?  Yes..yes, they're open til 4am and I'm sure they get the 1am to 4am bar, but again, how does this place remain open for only 2-3 hours of business?  And supposedly serves dinner too.  I would say that there appears to be some shady people in there all the time, but that's what you can expect.  They did put up a brand new sign 2-years ago...and with the OPAH, I would assume the chewy pieces you eat are lamb or Greek oriented.",0.3502,0.932,0.041,0.027,0.6228324915824915

A piece of pizza at Chicago's and a few at Oakwood are a great way to cap off a night out. Make sure you're drunk before you get there though. You'll know if you're too sober to be in there, cuz the place will smell of sewerage. Yes it's true. Get your nose drunk first.",0.5423,0.755,0.139,0.106,0.5890589569160998

In fact, this bar is awesome.  It might have to do with the fact that I am always trashed by the time I get here, but even on the less trashed nights I've enjoyed myself.  It's so nice to have a late night bar within walking distance. Drinks are reasonable and the tunes are usually pretty good.  The people watching though is really the best!! I knocked one star off because of the jukebox never playing my song.  I even got my songs in first once then the thing went out so they let me put my songs back in and they STILL didn't play- I don't like that skipping feature cause I NEVER hear my songs. Otherwise the Oakwood is really awesome.",0.9918,0.731,0.236,0.033,0.5761904761904761
2008-12-27,3.0,"Got to the bar around two in the morning after last call at Quencher's and my friend thought that Oakwood was the low key environment he was looking for and was pleased.  It was relatively empty and a Bud Light and Heineken cost $9.  My friend compared it to being in his parents' basement as the wood paneling on the wall looked of the 1970's.  In the corner there were video poker and a jukebox people kept feeding money. As the night wore on more and more people rolled in and the bar all of a sudden became packed to the brim.  There were some cute girls there but it was also a kielbasa festival as the P. to D. Ratio was somewhere between 1:25 and 1:20.  There are always weird locals who are there by themselves trying to pick up girls or do whatever the hell, that is why Oakwood gets three star.",0.0129,0.855,0.076,0.069,0.6424242424242425

HA!  Not really - I dont know why everyone seems to think that the Oakwood is a bad place.  Sure it gets crowded at times, but what bar doesnt.  Sure, it gets it cast of shady characters, but again, what bar doesnt?  It's a bar people, and a late night bar at that!  When other bars close, Oakwood is just starting, so you can expect that the drunks that need to keep drinking are going to be pouring in through the door. If you are looking for something out of this world fancy, no, this isnt the bar for you.  if you are looking for a place to hang out with your friends, and possibly entertained at the same time..  this is definitely a spot to hit up in the after hours. As far as food goes, I couldnt tell you..  I have never eaten here before, and honestly, I probably wouldnt - because the only time I think of going to Oakwood is when a friend of mine who is more then obsessed mentions that we ""NEED TO HIT UP THE OAKWOOD!"".   Just a note, if you go in before the afterhours-  It is a pretty calm place with some older people sitting around drinking a few beers..  So if you just dont want to be bothered, and want to hang out at the bar, go for it.",0.9762,0.792,0.145,0.063,0.6215608465608465

If you are a woman  beware! you will be the center of some unwanted attention bye some very drunk S.O.B's who are mad at the world and themselves. This place really does suck bad. One night I came in and it was nothing but drunken loser's. I felt sorry for the few women who were inside, loser's were spilling drinks and starring really hard through the alcoholic fueled goggles. What was really worst that night was that someone was playing on the jukebox nothing but Milli Vinnilie all night long!!, horrible music!!",-0.9772,0.75,0.028,0.221,0.5958333333333333
2008-02-26,4.0,"Not sure what everyone else is talking about, but I dig this place. I haven't gotten in a fight, come close to getting in a fight, nor even seen a fight break out here. Granted, I was here late late night, but still. There were about 15 of us or so in the whole place, the drinks were stiff, and everyone seemed to be having a good time without being obnoxious. True, it's a service industry hang out, and I no longer work in a restaurant or bar, but how can guys complain that they can't meet a girl here? Yeah, you can't meet a girl here if you're a muscle-bound dick basket, that's true, but if you have any kind of skill, you should be able to pick up a cute service industry chick, which I did as an out-of-towner when I was here for Lolla. And, yes, she was hot... no beer goggles involved... So, the moral of the story is: if you're chill and just want a place to hang out with your friends and drink, this is a cool bar, and you might even get lucky. If you're a frat boy moron, we're glad you hate it here. Go somewhere else.",0.969,0.683,0.209,0.108,0.7165123456790125
