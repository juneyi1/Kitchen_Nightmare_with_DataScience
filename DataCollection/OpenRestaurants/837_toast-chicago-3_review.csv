I tried the chorizo scramble and was very satisfied, in part because Toast doesn't scrimp on the meat.  While the potatoes were a miss, I liked my challah toast on the side...from the pancakes I tried on my daughter's plate, I was pretty satisfied with this meal.

My most recent visit was on a Sunday around noon for 2 and there was no wait for the back patio (even for a gorgeous day). The tables are close together but it makes for fun conversations with random people who look on enviously at your food. After I drooled over the menu for 10 minutes, we finally decided to share a few plates (because we're fat like that): Tijuana Omelette, El Bucktowno sandwich with potatoes & the Stuffed French Toast. I expected to have a clear favorite but I honestly cannot pick which gave my taste buds the most joy! The Tijuana was the perfect amount of spicy and savory (didn't have to douse in hot sauce which is a rarity for me), El Bucktowno's bread was made by angels and hand-delivered here, and do I have to say anything about the stuffed french toast that the other Yelpers haven't already said (I will eat cardboard as long as there's Nutella on it so perhaps I'm easier to please than most)?! The service was great even though our server was busy with all of the tables on the patio and we were able to order, eat and pay all under an hour.

2017-05-31,5.0,"Instead of being stuck in Chicago traffic, a brunch was the best solution to kill time. Yelp had TOAST with some high recommendations and close to an exit on the freeway.. so we came..  Place is pretty cool, there's inside and outside seating, and the weather called for outside seating, it was cool and breezy. The tables have umbrellas if you want some shade, but with the trees providing some shade, it really isn't necessary..  Menu is 1 page and is very simply to read along with being very descriptive with what each option is all about. The scramble eggs options seemed to be very popular in yelp so my wife and I decided to try a scramble each. She went with the prosciutto and pesto and I went with chorizo and cheddar..  both were amazing. Talk about portion and seasoning being on point for each dish, and you for yourself a winner here. These are both just tries, and once you do, come again and try something else. I also tried the Stuffed French Toast, which was ordered as a kids order ( 1 slice) full side is 2 pieces. The French toast had a sweet cheese inside, i believe it's called mascarpone ? I could be wrong.. but try it ! Add the syrup and it's like whoa all in your taste buds.. seriously..  The service was 5/5 hands down. Her recommendation of 1 piece stuffed French toast was awesome as the scramble portions are pretty big.. will definitely come again !

They're pretty much cheesy scrambled eggs with the aforementioned ingredients mixed in and served with seasoned red taters on the side. My scrambler was a little salty.  The Miss Foodie Piggy in me ordered a short stack of the seasonal gingerbread pancakes (you get 2) too for good measure. Well spiced, but the batter was dry, so definitely dig into the syrup. Overall, the food was A-OK, but not great. Oh! But how could I almost forget the toast you get on the side of your meal? My brioche slices  were worthy of 4 stars. Fresh and chewy, buttered and toasty. Mm mm mm. Challah, sourdough, and the typical white and multigrain are also choices.

To start off, if you are epileptic or have a sensitivity to light, don't go to this location. They have recess lighting above circulating fans, causing the entire restaurant to blink. While some people might be able to ignore this, it gives me migraines and makes me sick. They did turn the fans off for me, but this is just a warning.  I ordered the regular eggs Benedict with the homestyle potatoes and some chocolate chip pancakes. The eggs on the Benedict were cooked perfectly, absolutely perfectly and the pancakes were really tasty. Unfortunately that's the best thing I can really say about my brunch here. The potatoes were actually burnt, and the rest of the Benedict was so salty I had trouble eating it without my lips hurting.

He had the french toast orgy which consisted of three french toast, vanilla? strawberry, and chocolate. In my opinion, it was extremely sweet for breakfast, but with its portion, it can definitely hold you over until dinner! He liked it as he finished the entire dish. Personal preference I suppose. I had eggs benedict with artichoke hearts and spinach. The eggs benedict was a bit too tart for me, I think too much lemon juice?, and the artichoke hearts did not pair well with the spinach and the tartness of the eggs benedict. Again, it's my personal preference to not have sour with eggs.

And I didn't like the coffee... it was way too bitter. Our waitperson was good, but our busser was excelent. He had a smile on his face the entire time he was at our table. He filled our water glasses several times, brought us fresh cups of coffee (as bad as the first cups), and asked us if it was okay to clear the table.

There's a lot going on on the plate, but it all works well together. It was plenty sweet (in a good way), so I didn't even need to add syrup to it. The berries are fresh and the yogurt and granola add great texture to the stuffed french toast.

We were just about to leave and go get sushi across the street when we were finally seated. Around 2:45.  The atmosphere and decor were cute, if a little kitschy for my taste, but the seating was just absurdly close together.

It arrived relatively quickly and it was good. But not quite good enough to make it worth the ridiculously long wait and the awkwardly cramped seating arrangement.

Today, at Toast Two, I sprung for a breakfast burrito. Unfortunately, it was not flavorful. I didn't get the jalapeños, but I doubt that is the only thing that makes it good. The side potatoes were the best part of the entree. My niece got the very large serving of yogurt with granola, which was topped with tons of fresh fruit.

I'm new to the area and noticed that there are almost always people waiting for a table on the weekends for brunch so I checked out the menu online and thought it sounded like a great classic brunch stop.  If a restaurant is going to be strictly breakfast/brunch place (no bar, no bottomless mimosas, no shtick) then surely the food must be great. Or so I thought. The wait for a table was going to be 30 minutes on a Sunday around 10 a.m. But a couple of spots opened up at the counter, so we sat there immediately. We were offered and served coffee pretty quickly. I think the service was good. Not overly personal or friendly but polite and efficient. The food is where things fell apart. I ordered the two egg breakfast (eggs, toast, bacon, breakfast potatoes). My scrambled eggs were way overcooked and the potatoes were hard.  My friend ordered the French Toast. It certainly looked pretty when it came it out. But it, too, was completely overcooked and dried out.  There are a lot of other brunch options in the area.

2014-05-12,3.0,"Definitely order breakfast. Do not come here to order from the lunch menu. I had a crazy weekend, starting with being whisked away to a surprise brunch experience by a very dear friend. I have yet to explore Chicago for breakfast joints, and Toast was one of his suggestions that he decided against. However, I took mental note because I love diners and I have yet to find a place fit for my expectations in the city. Toast does not fit the bill. Rocking serious hangovers, my new friend and I decided that a substantial breakfast would assist in stopping our dizzy heads and perhaps reset our cloudy and unmotivated attitudes. He ordered the veggie burger, and I got the El Bucktowno. What came to our table looked much different from what we had pictured inside our heads. His veggie burger looked like someone cut out small pieces of construction paper, took a bunch of Elmer's glue, and made a patty out of the clippings, and threw it in a bun. I almost burned my mouth on the over-cooked chicken in my sandwich, and there was so much zucchini, it was hard to keep it inside the bun. For both of us, there was no flavor in our selections at all. No one was saying it needed to be deep fried; but you can marinate chicken and you can also use spices.    My friend and I are form the suburbs, and we are not used to sitting so close to other diners. At toast, you feel like a fish in a can of sardines. I have learned to get used to it. I can even take the noise level. However, you sit me next to two loud and pretentious hipster girls who pretty much favor the sound of their own voice over actually listening to what their breakfast companion is saying; I will draw the line. My friend and I kept looking at each other, eyes practically bleeding at being subjected to their conversation. There was no choice. We had to listen to them and we couldn't even talk because it would have meant that we needed to raise our voices even more to hear each other. We resorted to texting each other with jokes regarding their sense of fashion, and perhaps both of them lacking men in their lives. Who would even stomach a date with these girls? There were, however, some very attractive men that dined here. I am not usually one to check out guys with tattoos and gauged earrings; but my visit to Toast changed my mind.  Our waitress was amazing. She was so gracious and patient with everyone. I don't know how she does it, but she treated everyone like they were royalty. I didn't catch her name, but she had blond hair and cat-eye glasses. We made sure she got a decent tip. My tip to the reader would be to stick to breakfast if you eat at Toast.

I said no it was 2:43  Online it says they take tables to 2:45 and are done serving at 3:00 (no mistake) this is what it says.  What's important for me here is the integrity of doing what you say, if you seat til 2:45 and serve til 3:00 it's a shame you would turn down two vigilant diners who battled the cold to come be restored. In addition there was a significant group of diners in the restaurant who would have been finished long after us.

2013-10-13,4.0,"After driving by Toast Two for almost a year on my way to my tennis club, and completely missing it (clearly I'm not the most observant), I finally spotted it a few weeks ago and happened to go yesterday for breakfast.  Apparently, Bongo Room doesn't open until 9, and we were ready for breakfast by 8:30! Since we weren't willing to wait around, I realized this was the perfect opportunity to try Toast Two. Unfortunately when we got there there were no tables available but the hostess did offer us the opportunity to immediately sit at the bar, which we took.  Celebrating the late arrival of fall, I immediately decided on the Pumpkin Pancakes with pumpkin whipped cream on the side. My BF decided to order the Tijuana scramble with an English muffin (his choice) and breakfast potatoes. Both were really good! We ended up swapping our dishes with one another so we could have a fair share of the sweet with the savory.  It was perfect. I just wish the seats at the bar had back rests because I would have enjoyed my meal more if I had been comfortable. I almost scarfed my entire meal down so I wouldn't have to sit on the stool any longer. I guess this just means I need to go back in the hopes of getting to sit at a real table with comfortable chairs and see if Toast Two can earn its 5th star :).",0.9948,0.779,0.202,0.019,0.5463293650793651

Sadly they were closed (strange for a Tuesday), but glad I stumbled across another brunch gem. My friends both had Eggs Benedict, which looked absolutely amazing. I opted for a healthier option (at least in my mind) with the peppered eggs and a side of chicken sausage. The chicken sausage was a magically delicious savory hint of apple goodness. We were fighting over the last piece like two homeless alley cats....man that sausage was amazing!  Cute, quaint, looks like my grandma's kitchen, easy street parking during the weekday.

One week I went here about three times that is how much I fell in love with it. They also give you endless coffee and oh my god it is delicious not your typical old coffee sitting for 3 days in the pot kind of coffee. I left feeling full and energized with all the cups of coffee. On one trip I had some coffee left and the server was so kind as to bring a to go cup for the coffee. I was the happiest super good food and friendly staff.

2013-09-01,4.0,"Welp Yelp, my first Chicago brunch experience with my best friends was a success. After deciding through an extensive Yelp search, I decided to make an executive decision (Kurt Russell and Halle Berry, anyone?) and head to Toast Two.  Since my friends live near Bucktown, I wanted to walk but being with hung over 20 somethings, we decided to hop in my brothers Buick and head over. After parallel parking, we were told it would be a 30 to 45 mins for a table. The wait was only about 20 mins. This place is small but there is a patio in back which is where we were led to sit. I was not expecting to dine al fresco but we loved the Julius Melini coffee umbrellas providing shade. Our large testosterone filled group was ready our order food after getting iced coffees, coffee (this is why I'm hot) and waters. I went with the Tijuana omelette, fruit instead of potatoes, multigrain toast, and a side of whole wheat cakes to split with my twin brother. We were the only two that were not hung over as I mentioned before. Brother ordered the vegetarian omelette. Rest of the table enjoyed a Cobb Salad, Cobb Club Sandwich sliders, burger of the day, and their iced coffees. Food was great! Service was okay, but what do you expect? Refills had to be constantly asked for, especially on water. The menu is simple. Besides the service I found two pancakes for six bucks a bit much. Sure they were whole grain and delicious, but I thought an order was three or four.  To our odd waitress, it was great to see you. I wish you were around more today. Bus boy was great at refills.  I would go back to sit back on the patio again. Wish I could have buttered up this review a bit more, but Toast Two should be on your list of Bucktown hot spots.  It is BYOB. I hate places that upcharge for fruit, but I understand. It's a business. As my friends mentioned, this is the kind of place a couple of cheeseburgers in paradise can chill on a Sunday afternoon.",0.9962,0.81,0.169,0.02,0.5409611992945327

We were seated on the patio on back. It was very nice to have the shade from the umbrella, because it was pretty hot in the sun. Everyone ordered Iced Coffee besides my bro and me. He went with the standard coffee and I went with water. For the entrees, my friends had the cobb club, the cobb salad, the bison sliders with potato salad, and the burger of the day (a breakfast burger type with sausage, egg, arugla, and potatoes). My brother and I ordered omelettes with multigrain toast and fruit. We also split a short stack (2 pancakes, so one each) of the whole wheat cakes. I went with the vegetarian omelette, which had shrooms, broccoli, peppers, onion, and gruyere cheese. I had it with egg whites too. My bro went with the mexican type omelette (Tijuana, I believe). It had peppers, jalapenos, and I'm forgetting the rest, but he enjoyed it. Fruit bowl had bananas, berries, and grapes. Not a fan of the 3.00 upcharge to have fruit instead, but that's the price I pay for being a bit healthier. Egg whites I understand, though (1.50 upcharge). The toast was perfect, the pancake was good (6 dollars for a shortstack? COME ON). Omelette was good, but nothing out of this world. Waitress wasn't very attentive, but she was nice. It was 35 bucks for my bro and me. A little expensive for my liking, especially since we didn't get that much food. Should have paid ten dollars less (Thanks Chicago). Overall, I'd probably go back.

We walked in on a weekday morning for brunch and were seated immediately.  The place was almost full but not packed.  I love the high ceiling; it reminds me of a barn, and the toasters decorating the entryway are adorable and quirky.  The whole place felt light and airy and like breakfast.   So it's funny that we ordered the heaviest items on the menu (I can't imagine it getting heavier): the french toast orgy and the vegetable eggs benedict, adding avocado and mozzarella.  (Actually it would've been heavier if we'd gotten a meat benedict). First, OH MY GOD THE LEMON HOLLANDAISE SAUCE YOWZA it's awesome.  I love benedict, but I've never had a lemon hollandaise.  The tangy lemon is just perfect with the creamy rich yolk-y hollandaise.  It went great on the pile of veggies (yum lemony artichoke hearts and spinach) and avocado and mozzarella.  We probably didn't need the mozzarella but it was yummy.  And the egg was very well poached.  The muffin was not very good though; tasted like chewy bread.  Wish it had those big sauce-holding nooks and crannies that English muffins should have, and/or was more toasted.  Served with potatoes which are fine. Next, the french toast orgy.  We wanted to order an orgy and aren't huge pancake fans, so french toast it was!  You have a choice of three stuffings: mascarpone, strawberry, mexican chocolate.  We nixed the chocolate and got two pieces filled with mascarpone and one with strawberry.  They're topped with powdered sugar, vanilla yogurt, granola, and berries.  The berries were great, and the yogurt was also pretty good.  The granola was a little too chewy to give enough textural contrast with the toast: it just tasted like harder french toast on french toast.  I could not finish this. I had OJ, fresh squeezed and delicious, he had some good coffee, and we had great service by a woman with short hair and tattoos.  I didn't get her name but I really liked her attentiveness, kindness, and helpfulness (she told us that we could mix and match our french toast, which was nice, and she checked in on us often but not too often). Overall, quite good!  Yay I'm a fan!  It's quite good, but not worth a wait of more than 10 minutes (I mean, you might as well just make your own breakfast at that point.  It's good but not AMAZING).",0.9977,0.708,0.219,0.073,0.521315850815851

The place is small but me and my brah got seated immediately (1:45 p.m. Sat). No waiting area so I imagine it would suck coming around prime hours and having to wait. I got the French Toast Orgy and I knew it would be a bad idea. For one because it's praised by Yelpers and to be quite honest, the consensus usually ends up sucking. Secondly I  normally get french toast at other establishments including some of the best offered in Chicago so it had to go up against Batter and Berries and Bristol. The dish was extremely bland, the texture wasn't very pleasurable and the yogurt brought the flavor quotient down a few notches. All three flavors sucked. The other dish ordered was the breakfast burrito but lets be serious, it's impossible to screw up a flour tortilla stuffed with chorizo, eggs and cheese. It was tasty and had a nice spice kick to it. I can praise them for their prices, which were generally affordable for the main dishes. The coffee was just decent, and for $4 we got 4 flimsy pieces of Oscar Meyer bacon.

Standing in front of a freezing cold door all day would make me crabby as hell. But it was like a quiet crabby-ness?  We were seated and ordered the pancake orgy and pesto scramble. He liked his pesto scramble a lot and I agreed. We both thought it was just going to be eggs with pesto thrown on top. Nope, it was blended with the egg and it still retained its nice pesto flavor. He really liked his cinnamon raisin toast. His potatoes could have been crisper. His OJ was tasted like Tampico.  I was happy with my pancake orgy at first. The yogurt was good, but then again you can't really go wrong with vanilla yogurt, fruit and granola. The marscapone was nice, but kind of lacking in flavor. I couldn't handle the strawberry french toast. It was just too mushy for me. I understand that there's strawberry inside, but it just looked like mush to me. I even scraped some of it out to see if I would like it better, but I didn't. Perhaps if I'm in the mood for brunch again, I'll get the regular French toast with berries on top.  Overall, I think Toast is a solid place for brunch. A bit cramped because I was scared that the guy next to me would knock over the vase of flowers into my french toast.

However, we were a bit let down and have been to far superior a brunch place at hubs such as Lou Mitchells and Milk and Honey. Here were our likes and dislikes: Likes: -Prompt coffee service. It was frigid Chicago morning thus warmth (both inner and outer) were our primary needs. -Immediate seating at the bar. Without that, our wait would have been 30 minutes- and we were only 2! -Solid egg white veggie omelet with marble rye toast. Moist and cheesy, this omelet perfectly balanced sinful with healthful. It's a pity that the sweet dishes get all the credit here, because there was surely something to be said for the quality of this dish. -Serving vanilla yogurt on top of pancakes - yum! Dislikes: -Somewhat aloof host.  Granted it was busy (but isn't it always at 10:30am during Sunday brunch?) but the host offered no smile, smirk, or any hint of pleasure at the presence of paying customers. Not a good mood-setter when you feel like an annoyance the moment you walk in the door. -Lack of waiting area/space in general.  This place is Cramped with a capital C. While we were seated at the bar, the constant opening and closing of the front door left a constant draft and I felt bad for those waiting for a table as there was no waiting area and they were seriously encroaching on other diner's ""space."" -An anticlimatic ""pancake orgy.""  We had heard of its sinfulness and deliciousness and yet were met with...well...pancakes :/ All 3 flavors were stacked on top of one another and all that could be discerned was the lemon poppyseed (very good btw). But that little blip of goodness misses the point that this pancake orgy was supposed to make. It was supposed to make the angels sing and glorify the pancake gods with its harmonious and unique flavors. This just seemed like a stack of flavored pancakes and I missed the banana altogether.

I took my mom there on her recent trip to Chicago to re-evaluate. And the verdict is... it's pretty good. This isn't to discount the quality of the food! I had a beef tenderloin sandwich (the special of the day), and it was great. My co-diners opted for an omelette and a scramble, and they were likewise pleased. The menu is what I'd consider ""the basics done right"". Not ""basic"" in the sense of Sunrise Cafe or other diner-style brunch places, but variety within the typical categories of pancakes, sandwiches, egg dishes, etc. However, the experience of eating at Toast leaves a little to be desired. For one, the place is small - they packed about as many tables and counter seats in as they could, but that's still only about 30 seats, and it's consequently a very loud place with a long waiting list and no waiting room. Prices are decent, and the service was harried but eventually polite. If you're going, I recommend a willingness to sit at the counter - on multiple occasions, it's been the difference between a 10 minute wait and a 40 minute wait.

After they took our plates away, the waitress brings the check to us without asking if we want anything else. We were planning on ordering more, so we thought it was rude but nonetheless, we continued to catch up. 20-some minutes later, we pay and decide to leave the waitress a 40% tip because we knew we were staying late to chat. 15 minutes later, a woman comes up and basically tells us to leave because we were staying at the table for too long and they apparently had to seat a large group.... despite the fact that there was no large group waiting outside or inside the restaurant and there were plenty of other open seats. They offered to give us a free drinks, which we declined and then we awkwardly left. It was ABSURDLY rude! We weren't acting disrespectfully, we were just talking.

Make it different!!  The BELT is on ciabatta bread, which admittedly, is the BEST way to have it (I've had the exact same sandwich in tons of breakfast restaurants!).  The choice of lettuce was perfect.  The applewood smoked bacon was good too.  There was one small egg that covered only half the sandwich inside...that was disappointing.  I've never seen such a tiny fried egg!  Now, if you're serving ciabatta bread on a sandwich, why in GOD'S NAME would you serve a side of potatoes?? Why not fruit as a side?   I ordered avocado for my sandwich on the side, for TWO DOLLARS!! It wasn't even a whole avocado.  Guys, c'mon!  It was about a 1/3rd of an avocado, for two freaking dollars.   To make it different, why not put a sauce on it, some mayo, or chipotle mayo or mango chutney cream cheese something....  Give it a little more flavor than just slapping crap together for a sandwich if it's going to be EIGHT DOLLARS!!!!!! Now, my friend had the stuffed french toast with the granola and yogurt on top.  I had a taste of that, and it was pretty amazing.  Please put that kind of creativity into your other dishes if you want premium price, and for people to have a truly unique experience.

Prepare for up to an hour. In nice weather, our usual routine is to put in our names, get coffee somewhere, and walk around the 'hood. I'm not a fan of more than a 15 minute wait anywhere, so in the winter, we usually just don't make it here. The decor is simple and cute.  Service has been overall excellent. Helpful suggestions from the servers, polite hosts and unobtrusive bussers. The only time we experienced anything less was our last visit on Apr 1. The host acted put-out to have to set us and the server was just barely adequate. Perhaps I'm just spoiled by otherwise more engaged service from Toast  II, and it was near the end of their day. In general though, I have always been pleased.  As another reviewer noted, the hollandaise here is perfection. Creamy, rich, and just enough tang. That gloppy over-lemoned mess you usually get places is not found here. Apparently I am the only person not in love with the ""orgy"" dishes. I find them odd-too dry in some places, too soggy in others and the yogurt seems too drippy and sour and the granola and french toast mixture just turns to a mushy chunky slosh on y plate mixed with bland tasting marscapone and overly sweet strawberries. I really hated it. However, I suppose it does have that comfort food things-a-6-year-old-would-eat craziness to it, and my Mother in Law really enjoyed it.  The first thing I ever had there was the pancake of the day which, at that time was a dark chocolate chip pancake with a chili whipped cream. This is the stuff my fantasies are made of. I love butter. Like Paula Deen love for butter, but these were so rich and creamy all I had to do was let the whipped cream melt onto the cakes and I was happy. The dark chocolate chips were not too sweet and offset nicely by the chili which was not hot at all. The pancakes themselves were a perfect texture. I have since tried other pancakes, and they are all good-however this combo could make them famous! Last time, I got the pesto scramble which was delicious. Scrambled in prosciutto and topped with Gruyere cheese and served with house potatoes it was substantial and delicious. Mr. J had the egg of the day which was similar to mine but with a different cheese (chihuahua?) and green chili sauce with green peppers. Also good.  The crabby Benedict is better than most places with nice sized hunks of crab and the regular Benedict are also delicious.  In all the egg dishes-my only complaint is that the eggs could use a bit less cook time. Both Benedicts and scrambles/omelettes the eggs are just the wrong side of done and border on rubbery.  The coffee is good. The OJ is a real treat. The prices area bit of a splurge, but the portions are good sized and the food is really enjoyable.  I feel like I can take anyone here and I have: from my trendy girlfriends, to pals after a long night of parties, to out of towners to get a feel for the 'hood to just me and my hubby for a nice breakfast. Even my in-laws who aren't adventurous eaters, but don't mind coming a bit out of the box. The food is familiar enough to be satisfying but different enough that you know you are eating breakfast you wouldn't have whipped up yourself in an atmosphere that is usually has a bit of bustle to awaken you but not too much trendiness.",0.9986,0.762,0.185,0.053,0.5611202686202688

What started out as a good morning quickly turned sour when our wait time went beyond what they said for 5 people. Not only that, there was an empty table that could fit us right next to the window that was clear for 20 minutes. I asked if we could just sit there, and they said it was reserved or something. Angry and hungry, my alter ego hungry Hans came out...and it wasn't pretty. By the time we sat down, we already knew what we wanted as we had plenty of time outside to figure it out. Me and my friend split the French Toast Orgy and Nutella crepe thing. Note: be careful about your wording when you say something like this because someone asked me what I was getting and I said ""we were splitting an orgy and..."" I didn't even need to complete the sentence. We got to try all 3 flavors with the orgy, but you could request just one if you like. I believe there was a mexican chocolate one, a strawberry, and a marscapone. I think I liked the marscapone and Chocolate on the best, but my friend really liked the marscapone. To each their own, but I like the the variety of getting all 3. They balance each other out. As for the crepe, I thought it was good, but a bit dry. There were a lot of pecans around it, which were nice, but as a whole, I thought the dish was a bit dry. I needed something. Even a little dollop of whipped cream would have been nice.  I tried my friends' dishes and they were good too. The veggie goat cheese one was awesome. And as the name implies, the toast was surprisingly good. I enjoyed the perfect brown-ness on them.  I think I would prefer Yolk over this, but this was also a good option.

The restaurant has always seemed kid-friendly so I was excited to take my kid here, and also very much looking forward to their amazing apple/pear/brie crepe. I ordered a kid's stack of blueberry pancakes for my toddler. When they came out, they had what appeared to be a whole bag of powered sugar on them. They were just covered in powered sugar...total mess. I explained to the waitress that I didn't really want my child to have powered sugar esp. not this much of it. She said that all of the pancakes have sugar on top (doesn't mention this in the kid's menu and wasn't told this when I ordered) .  So the point is - the food is terrific for adults. If you are looking for a healthy breakfast for your little one, make sure to specify that you don't want a dumping of powered sugar all over the kid's pancakes that you just ordered. It's a surprise that the generous use of sugar isn't mentioned on the menu or by the server considering how health conscious many parents are concerning their children.  Plus - the server (young lady with large black glasses) was a bit annoyed and acted like she couldn't understand why I wouldn't directly feed a pound of sugar to my little one.

She says if you get here in the next 5 mins, so we rush there, get there maybe 6 mins later, and she refused to seat us.  Now, I understand they have a policy about closing 15 mins before they're posted time, but why not just change your posted close time to when they ACTUALLY close (oh...it's in the ""fine print"" that they close their kitchen 15 mins before). I guess I assume that if I'm still finishing my coffee or toast at the exact close time, that I'm not going to be walked out to the curbside.  I usually assume that close time is when they'll stop seating people / taking new customers (i.e. close their doors to the OUTSIDE public).   Anyway, that may be a common practice, and not why I'm writing.  I'm writing because of the attitude and service of their so called manager. I called, she said if you get here in the next 5 mins, I say, ""okay, already on my way (so...maybe she should have been expecting us?)"", then I get there and she says no (with a smirk).

2011-04-18,3.0,"I can agree with some of the other 2 star reviews here, Toast Two did not win me over.  First, let's start with the good things:  -The wait, we were told 30 minutes--but were seated within 20. Yay!  -The staff, sure they were nice...but not over the top friendly.  -The joint is cutetsy! Loved all the little toasters lined up across the top of the wall. Then we can move on the negatives:  -We sat at the bar, but because of the ceiling light were blinded by the sun shining in. Yes, I realize that's not their fault, but c'mon...put up some blinds or something to block the rays of death coming in. I could barely even see what I was eating, let alone read the paper on a Sunday morning!  -The wait for food. UGH! It felt like it took FOREVER. Granted, it was a Sunday morning at 10:30 AM...but really, 40 minutes for two omelettes?!  -The omelet itself was bland. I had the Lorraine, which had apple wood smoked bacon, gruyere, chives, and onions. About the only thing good was the CHEESE because there was plenty of it. The bacon was disgusting, I imagined crispy smokey bacon...and instead I got limp chunks of fat. I don't think this was a applewood smoked bacon, but rather a run of the mill hormel Aldi special bacon. GROSS! I had to pick it out. The breakfast potatoes spread sparingly on the side of my plate were COLD. And my side of chicken apple sausage was good, but those were like the size of bratwursts.  -The bill: $41 for 2 omelettes, 2 coffees and 2 orders of chicken sausage.  Who knows, maybe their ""sweet"" items are better tasting?!  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say we MIGHT return, only to try the french toast or pancakes. But, bottom line, the food was average at best...but certainly didn't warrant a $48 bill with tax and tip.  For that price, I'd rather have Sola, Lula, or even the Publican for heaven's sake!",0.933,0.776,0.134,0.09,0.5841137566137565

Yum. I've explored pretty much the entire menu at Toast Two and I feel confident in saying it delivers on every single level imaginable.   Do you like eggs for breakfast?  The spinach, goat cheese and tomato omelet is superb.  Perhaps you're more of a basic breakfast person?  Get the two eggs any way you like them, served w/ one side (I clearly recommend the chicken sausage), house potatoes and toast.  The scrambled eggs are perfect and topped with a beautifully tasty sprinkle of chives. If sinful carbs are on the agenda, you cannot go wrong by ordering the French Toast Orgy.  Sounds dirty, right?  It is.  Imagine a plate piled high with French toast stuffed with puréed fresh strawberry, mascarpone and Mexican chocolate topped with vanilla yogurt, house made berry granola, fresh fruit and drizzled with honey.  Try rolling around in that breakfast and tell me what you think!  Word of caution: Wear expandable waist pants.  Or a loose belt. Toast serves up some amazing specials every day, too.  They always have a pancake special and if you're lucky, it (and it's Fall) you might score the pumpkin pancakes.  They're huge, luscious and out of this word.  I may or may not have once ordered them along with a spinach, goat cheese and tomato omelet.  Don't judge me. The only beef I have with Toast Two is that it's teeny tiny and they don't take reservations so if you show up at a popular brunching hour (any time between 10am-1pm), you're looking at a substantial wait.  I recommend getting there early or even making your trip to Toast Two a solo mission and trying to score a seat at the bar.",0.9938,0.798,0.177,0.025,0.5923952555381127

Here are some dishes I have tried: French Toast Orgy - the mexican chocolate french toast was a bit too rich, the strawberry is insanity and the mascarpone is equally succulent. Don't add syrup to these, people. You will regret it. I would almost be inclined to tell them to hold the granola, as it becomes a lot to ingest and maintain productivity for the remainder of my Sunday. Mascarpone Pancakes w/ pine nuts and anise and other things - This is my all time favorite here. The pancakes are crips on the edges, the flavors blend very well. I am in love. Breakfast Burrito - It's good. But seriously, why are you ordering this when you can have the mascarpone pancakes? Pesto Scamble - This was intense and I'm not sure I would order it again, or at least not as hungover as I was. Very good, very rich. House Potatoes - This is where I reach my dilemma. I love the house potatoes here. They come as a side with most of the savory items. Yet, I prefer the sweet dishes. I suggest the best of both worlds, would be to order this as a side. And i have been known to do so. I've also been to the Lincoln Park location and I'm not sure if I'm just partial to my own neighborhood.... but they were a little stuck up there!!

Perfect bacon (to me) means light on the grease, keep the size (i.e. a straight piece, not a short, curled up one that's bubbled with lots of fat) and make sure it's crispy.  Again, Toast Two *nailed it*.   I swear, if this was the Olympics, they'd be the Mary Lou Retton of breakfast.

Having tried most of the spots in my Old Town/Lincoln Park neighborhood, my mom and I went west to try Toast. It was totally worth enduring the North Avenue 72 bus, and you can't say that about much. A little after one o'clock, the host told us it would be a half hour wait, which was fine with us. We stumbled upon Duchamp (2 blocks north) for a libation (which was delicious, by the way) while we waited. A half hour later, the host told us to ""Please be patient, we will seat you as soon as we can."" It ended up being a 40-minute wait for our two seats at the counter. I personally thought that the host and the server behind the counter both had a little bit of a 'tude problem, but as soon as the food came (and I had a bit of the champagne we brought--gotta love BYOs), my mind was changed. The menu describes both the pancakes and french toast as ""orgies"" but I would not hesitate to add that description to the eggy options, too. I tried the goat cheese, spinach, and tomato omelette and my mom tried the pesto scramble, scrambled eggs with tomato, prosciutto, gruyere and, of course, pesto. Mine was delicious, maybe a bit too cheesy, but who can really complain about that? But my mom's was truly worthy of the ""orgy"" title. There was a ton of fresh pesto, and it was perfect with the smoky prosciutto. It's a must-order. She raved about the house potatoes, and the toast was pretty damn good for plain toast! I had the multi-grain and she had the marble rye.  What else is there to say?

The first impression of the place wasn't anything special -- as the decor and atmosphere was kind of bland and it's pretty small -- but the 20-30 minute wait was totally worth it. The guy at the front desk was funny and nice and sat us a little quicker than we had been told our wait would be which was cool.  The eggs are the BEST eggs I have had and we eat at breakfast places all the time. The house potatoes are awesome! So for food it's a 5 STAR -- the service was excellent.

I wanted to order a scramble that contained, among other ingredients, chorizo.  I wanted avocado instead of chorizo, and I saw on the menu that avocado and chorizo cost $2 to add to any dish.  So Toast values these items equally.   I told the waiter my plan, and he told me I could order the scramble and he would have the kitchen hold the chorizo.  Reading between the lines, I asked if that meant that I had to order the avocado as an extra item.  He said ""yes.""  I asked ""Why?"" He said they don't do substitutions, as per restaurant policy (which I couldn't find anywhere).   If the place was crowded, I would understand that substitutions might mess the kitchen up.  But there were only a few other patrons in the place when I got there around 11:15am, and mine was the only order being placed as everyone else in there had their food already.  I thought this was a pretty crappy way to treat a customer.  I wanted to ask for my unused chorizo to go, just so the restaurant didn't get to keep my $2 worth of greasy Mexican sausage.

With aunt ordering orange juice (fresh squeezed and only $3 for a good sized glass) and myself going for coffee - a strong breakfast blend with mostly floral notes and a decent acidity - we perused the unique menu full of the standard breakfast, lunch, and brunch foods plus some really unique options.  Decisions made we placed our orders and waited approximately 15 minutes while chatting and browsing the kitschy interior (toasters EVERYWHERE) before our food was delivered. For my aunt her selection was the ""pancake orgy"" featuring a stack of three thick and buttery yet perfectly golden and chewy pancakes topped with raspberry granola, creamy yougurt, and a drizzle of honey.  With each pancake featuring a different flavor we both rather suspected they would be served linearly instead of as a stack, but on tasting we were both impressed by how each pancake tasted entirely different but also worked as a whole.  Featuring a mild apple cinnamon pancake on top, a zippy and sour lemon poppy seed in the middle, and a banana pecan on the bottom I personally liked the banana pecan best (perhaps the post-New Orleans bias?) while aunt fancied the apple cinnamon.  Offered a bite early in the meal my aunt is thankfully weak and couldn't finish much so I was able to later add some maple syrup and finish off the banana pecan cake. For myself the decision was easy - French Toast Orgy. Served essentially as a single 2 inch thick slice of stuffed brioche divided into three ""fingers"" the dish was again topped with an ample helping of raspberry granola, savory and smooth yogurt, and honey - I also added ample maple syrup, pure unless my taste buds deceive me.  Featuring three different styles I first tasted the chocolate - mild hints of cocoa, great crispy and textural exterior with a melt in the mouth interior.  Second I tasted the mascarpone and it turned out to be my favorite of the group with the sweetened cheese forming a pockets of creaminess inside the already buttery and smooth bread-pudding textured toast.  My final taste was stuffed with pureed strawberry and while not quite as delectable as the other two (lacking the creaminess) I loved the tart contrast - eating it with the chocolate toast was superb.   Very pleased with the griddled goods my aunt and I were equally enamored with the copious amount of fresh berries delivered with the breakfasts - in Los Angeles or New York the fruits included would've likely more than doubled the price of the meal.  Paying the bargain tab and leaving a large tip we made our way to the streets and our easily obtained free parking spot very pleased with the Toast experience - between Bongo Room, Toast, M.Henry, and the myriad spots serving weekend brunch Chicago still reigns as my favorite breakfast city by far.",0.9971,0.836,0.141,0.022,0.5295754245754245

This place gets four stars for being so consistently good. Only once in my dozens of outings there have I experienced the rude service mentioned already in these reviews; our waitress was obviously hungover and wretched but that was once, our tip told her as much, and we've never had her since.  But back to the positives: start to finish, anything here that touches my tongue is fantastic. The coffee is bold and fresh and can cure any hangover. While the sweet breakfasts look out of this world, I have to stick to my morning staples: eggs, potatoes, and toast. I love the mexican special they often have -- cilantro and jalap. egg scramble with salsa, house potatoes and wheat toast dry. Always dry.  I'm often inclined to order a cup of fruit, too, because this is a place that doesn't skimp on fruit: berries, bananas and grapes. Yumm! I love that they don't serve dingy plates of un-ripe melons and cantaloupe.  Sure, there is often a wait when you go during warmer months, mid-morning.

Not crappy, awful, ""should have slept in"", bad. Just okay.  We got here before the mad rush on a cool Sunday morning. Eating outside was out of the question so I was thrilled to see a two top with our name on it as we walked in just before 9am.  We ordered and sat waiting to get anything. Coffee, people! Want a great review? Bring me coffee! Now! But bring it with real cream for my dining companion as he hates anything but half and half or real cream, and that milk that came in that little pitcher did nothing to assuage the need. COFFEE!! I NEED COFFEE!!  A cup arrived. It was gone in a flash- almost inhaled and then the forever wait for cup number two. Where are they going for my coffee . . . .Brazil?  Thank heaven our food came up then- Eggs Benny for me and a Breakfast Burrito for the man who sat across from me still glowering about the lack of cream. They were both good but not great. The hollandaise sauce on my eggs was a little too lemony but the chopped tomatoes on top were a nice touch. And the potatoes that came with it? Not so good. Kind of soggy and boring. The burrito was definitely the better choice.  Our server was literally missing in action during our visit. I can't be the only one who needs tons of coffee in the morning. The fact that they had to take my cup, go back and pour the coffee out of a carafe behind the bar and then return with one cup every time someone wanted a refill was a problem.  Breakfast for two ran around $36. A bit pricey in my opinion for the food served. Parking on Damen on a Sunday morning? Easy, Peasy. But the biggest opportunity? Service.

Negatives: No more lavender French toast? Sadness. Not every egg dish comes with toast, which is a little weird. The vegetarian Eggs Benedict were awful. I had never had Eggs Benedict before, and it had artichoke and spinach on it which I love, so I figured I'd give it a whirl. It was a shame because I ordered this instead of 3 other dishes, all of which I surely would have enjoyed a lot more. Like the reviewer below, mine too was swimming in hollandaise, which I immediately disliked the taste of and after a while the smell made me ill. Since there was no toast (!) I at least ate the eggs I could salvage and the potatoes (also disappointing, a bit flavourless).  My boyfriend got the french toast with mixed berries and a side of bacon. The bacon was good, and perfectly crisp, but $4? For 4 slices? Hmm, a bit much. His french toast filled him up, though, and since my dish was gross I nibbled some of the black berries he discarded (what a fool).  I loved the coffee, though, and all is right in the world when I have some coffee. A lot of the sandwiches also looked good on the menu (and I sneaked peeks at what my fellow diners ordered), so if I come back I'm getting plain eggs or lunch.

2009-08-27,2.0,"So what's the difference between this place and other breakfast places? Nothing.  One thing that kinda turns me off is the fact that these little brunch places (that are SO popular with the ladies) is the fact that they're ridiculously expensive for no god awful reason. Why does this place cost just as much as eating dinner? I just don't get it.  I ordered a Breakfast Burrito with Chorizo (I always get breakfast burritos if there's nothing on the menu I like) and my gf decided to have the French Toast stuffed with Mascarpone. What the hell is mascarpone? It honestly tasted like nothing. Call me an uncultured low class breakfast burrito eating dummy but the french toast tasted like light fluffy bread... and the mascarpone that was inside the light fluffy bread tasted like creamy nothing. We also shared a side of their potatoes which were nothing too great... just potatoes. The best part about this meal was that it cost me $30 bucks. I love spending $30 bucks for a burrito that I scarfed down in 3 minutes and light fluffy toast with creamy nothingness inside with little pieces of fruit around it. Maybe I'm just not into breakfast (which I'm not) and I'm definitely not into expensive breakfast/brunch places. This place is just OK for me. If I had a choice, I'd go to YOLK where they have a great menu... it's just too bad their location sucks for me cause it's so far into the city.  If you like breakfast/brunch and you have the cash for it, I'd recommend this place. The people/person who took our order was super nice and had a very inviting vibe to her but other than that, the food was just average. Maybe I'm expecting too much for a breakfast joint... but if I'm gonna spend $11 for a breakfast burrito that wasn't all that great, I'd better get something else too... like.. I dunno.. a side of potatoes for free. Actually... yeah... why didn't my breakfast burrito come with hash browns or something. Even McDonalds gives you hashbrowns with your two breakfast burritos!

If you aren't in the mood for something as filling, I would go for the Pepper Eggs, they are scrambled with red and yellow peppers, cheddar cheese served with their house potatoes and toast. Their potatoes are really great with just the right amount of seasoning. Since I'm on the kick of egg talk, I might as well get into the Omelette talk.

2009-05-03,3.0,"So I suppose we'll chalk this whole experience up to my sense of whimsy, and its epic fail...well, its epic fail AT Toast, at least, and its charming transition into a moveable feast. Moral of the story? Taking my ideas seriously will sometimes lead to delightfully bizarre consequences. Also, as you're reading, be sure not to miss my plug for the Map Room!  Anyway, my friend Peter has a bearded dragon named Toast, and her supposed birthday is May 5th. When I learned of this, my immediate reaction was, ""OMG! We have to take Toast to Toast for her birthday! She'll wear a ribbon around her neck and we'll feed her stuffed french toast with mascarpone cheese and marmalade!"" Now, dear reader, you and I might hear this 'suggestion' and laugh, but Peter took me up on it, completely, even made it an event on Facebook. I hadn't even been to Toast in over three years, but somehow believed that if we could hide Toast the bearded dragon in a bag, everything would be okay. Although as we took off from Logan Square to go to Bucktown, I started wishing that Toast's name was Lula.  We strolled up to Toast--the restaurant--and put our names in. We were told that it would be a 45 minute wait, annoying but par for the course at 11:00 on a Sunday in Bucktown.  I desperately needed coffee, and, as we were heading towards the Starbuck's on Armitage, brilliantly remembered that the Map Room serves coffee in the morning! Yes--iced Intelligentsia! Peter and I walked in, Toast in clear sight, and the three of us were welcomed with open arms. Nobody cared that we had a bearded dragon--and she was even sans ribbon; we just sat at a high table and I sipped my coffee and Peter sipped his Red soda, and everyone thought Toast was adorable. ""I'm sure they'll let her in at Toast! I would definitely let her in!"" Emboldened by the small, pro-bearded lizard crowd at the Map Room, Peter and I walked back to Toast and were immediately seated. I ordered Julius Meinl coffee--YUM!--and the Pesto Scramble, and Peter got buffalo sliders. There was this charming young man at the table next to us who had just gotten an enormous plate of French Toast Orgy put down in front of him, and he immediately offered us some. I was going to be cheeky and comment that perhaps he thought he was up the street at Bristol, seated at the communal table, but am now so glad that I was earnestly gracious. As I was nearly finished with my first cup of coffee, the manager came over and said that we had to leave! ""Take the Iguana out of here!"" So Peter got up and took Toast the bearded dragon outside. I waved over our waitress, Michelle, and sheepishly asked if we could have our order to go.  Michelle was a rock star! Not only was she apologetic and sweet and totally unfazed by the fact that her table had been kicked out of the restaurant for bringing a LIZARD into the restaurant, she gave me a huge cup of coffee to go, and filled our bag with lots of jelly, butter, and ketch-up!  Hurray for Michelle, and hurray for nice guy seated next to me! By this time, he had nearly finished his French Toast Orgy, but, after hearing my tale of woe, asked, ""So, what does Toast eat?"" ""She loves grapes and kumquats and sometimes eats veggie pellets that are cricket-flavored,"" I replied. The next thing I knew, nice guy had obtained a small Julius Meinl coffee cup and filled it with the grapes from his French Toast Orgy! ""Tell Toast Happy Birthday,"" he smiled.  So I walked out to find Peter chatting with two more completely sympathetic young women on the sidewalk. They agreed that perhaps a picnic was better on such a fine day, and everyone was pleased by the addition of the grapes.  Peter and I strolled down Damen to Churchill Park and sat ourselves down to our picnic. Toast enjoyed the sunlight and the grass, and we enjoyed watching all the puppy dogs playing in the dog park. ""This is so much better than eating at Toast,"" Peter smiled as I spread out our brunch. My pesto scramble was delicious for awhile, but then got REALLY salty. The challah toast was delicious. Peter and I smeared some of the blackberry jelly onto Toast's nose so she could lick it off. The whole thing was adorable.  Overall, celebrating Toast's birthday was a huge success. If you actually want to sit in an establishment with your bearded dragon, stick to the Map Room.

Served with fresh berries (and grapes, it seems) and a side of syrup. Because a little more sugar won't kill you. You get three ""sticks,"" which amounts to maybe one big slice of bread, but believe me, it's plenty. If it's not, you can go with the French toast orgy, which is all of the above, but topped with yogurt and granola and drizzled with honey. Squeal like a pig! I went with a side of bacon and potatoes, which was a little bit of a disappointment. The bacon was overdone for my taste, and the potatoes were kind of gooey. So it goes. There are enough selections on the menu that everyone in our group ended up with very different choices: crab Benedict, Mexican omelette, and pesto scramble. The Hollandaise sauce on the Benedict was perfect: thick and creamy, with enough lemon to give it a nice bite. Unlike its Lakeview sister, Toast Two is BYOB.

But now that I can no longer have wheat and gluten, I still enjoy Toast without the namesake. The omelettes and eggs are fantastic, as is the coffee and espresso drinks.
