They were willing to fill both water bottles and were really nice about it. I ordered the Pho tai with extra noodles so they gave me a large bowl of pho but the noodles weren't enough so I had to order more. The broth was over all really flavorful and had a bit of an herbal kick. The service was okay, had to call them over whenever you needed something but they were pretty attentive as long as you needed them.  If they more noodles I may have given this place 4 stars but I have a big appetite and had to ask for two servings of extra noodles. Would I come back?

We've had various dishes at this restaurant over the years and the quality in the past couple years has been consistently better than most Vietnamese restaurants found Chicago.  Another hidden gem, they make really really good Vietnamese sandwiches here (the one loaded with pork belly). IMO, the sandwich here is better than Ba Le and Nhu Lan. Whenever I don't have time for a dine in experience, the sandwich to go is my alternate option. I do have a few other Vietnamese restaurants close to where I live, but I still make the drive to uptown for the food at this place. The Canh Bun (seafood udon noodle soup) is really good, this item is not on the menu book, it's one of those new/special dish that they post on one of their walls.

2013-03-15,4.0,"In the twenty years that I have been to Argyle for noodles, I have never stepped inside this place. I decided it was time to try a new place. The fact that my usual spot, Double Happiness, was closed due to a vacation, probably helped too. I came here with two friends who have also never been here, and we decided to all order different types of noodles so we can get a sample of what they had to offer.  Since I was already in the mood for egg noodles, I ordered the Mi Trieu Chau (shrimp, pork, chicken, wonton and quail egg in egg noodle soup). My friends ordered the Mi Bo Sate (egg noodles in a lemongrass beef curry soup) and the ""Special"" pho (beef eye round, flank, brisket, soft tendon, beef balls and tripe). I was not impressed with my noodles. I prefer my egg noodles to be more firm. It's difficult to describe, but I am picky with my egg noodles. The soup was ok, I had to add my own condiments to flavor it to my liking. I also tried my friend's pho. It was good. Not the best, not the worst. Her portion was very generous compared to mine, although neither of us specified a size. I have never seen Mi Bo Sate on any menus in all my years of Vietnamese noodle eating, but it was delicious. Probably my most favorite. I would come back for this alone. I would definitely recommend it if you like a curry based broth.  The service was typical Argyle service, if you know what I mean. The server was an older man who was very nice but had limited English. We weren't able to really ask questions, and had to point on the menu to tell him what we wanted.

I thought that they gave me too much broth and not enough meat, which is a little strange considering that I had ordered the dac biet / special (the one with EVERYTHING). But perhaps I made the mistake of coming here after a visit to California, so ok, I thought I'd give them another try before I write my review.  I came back here recently with the boyfriend. After a full day of eating through the city, we weren't very hungry so we had opted to get a salad and soup.  We ordered the papaya salad and my favorite canh chua ca soup. The papaya salad was passable. I was a little upset that it came without the shrimp chips on the side, and the salad was also a little too soggy for me. It had an adequate amount of half shrimps, but not enough pork slices. Or, perhaps I gave most of the pork slices to my boyfriend. Who knows. All I know was I thought that Tank Noodle does a better version of this, shrimp chips/crackers and everything.  The canh chua ca soup was very bland, in my opinion. It wasn't nearly as flavorful as Cafe Hoang's, but I think Cafe Hoang does the Thai version of this soup with added lemongrass. The soup should still taste fine without lemongrass, but it didn't. The tomatoes weren't fresh. I bit into one that tasted awful. I think they also made this soup in a hurry and so it lacked flavor. A lot of it.

It's very nondescript - just like all the other Vietnamese/Pho restaurants in the neighborhood. (They must buy their furniture from the same store - I digress.)  What sets them apart is the Pho. I realize Tank is very popular, but their pho base tastes more and more watered down. The soup base at Pho Xe Lua is flavorful, not oily, and not MSG laden. It's also at a very fair price of just under $6 a bowl! They definitely don't skimp on the noodles, broth, or the amount of meat they include in this bowl of comfort.

Pho Xe Lua proved me wrong.  It is possible to make Pho that exceeds expectations and truly excites the taste buds.  For starters, the Pho section of the menu is vast, so you have a lot of control over what exactly you are getting.  The broth base is flavorful but not too fishy or salty.  In my experience they have always been very generous with herbs and bean sprouts, which is great because I want a heavy dose of Thai basil.  I have always found the meat to be the perfect rareness... not too chewy but also not raw.  The bowls are very generous, so there is really no need to order any appetizers or sides. And to top it all off, the staff is wonderful.  My first time in, they forgot to give me my boba thai tea.  The next time I came in, the woman taking my order remembered me without my saying anything and offered me a free drink.  That to me is incredible, and exceptional customer service.

All of these elements together would have earned Pho Xe Lua 5 stars hands down... but they made one fatal error.  The eye of round steak slices were overcooked which made them harder to chew!

I stopped by on a tuesday for lunch. I was in the mood for my people's food so thought I'd be spontaneous and pick a random place I haven't tried yet- also because some of the others were closed on tuesdays.  I picked this place. Not even looking at yelp because other's opinions on vietnamese food on yelp usually aren't very helpful. It was empty except for another table with a vietnamese family. I knew they were viet because I could understand everything they were saying- just cuz they're asian and in a viet restaurant doesn't mean they're automatically viet. Also just cuz they were vietnamese it didn't mean shit to me whether the food is tasty. It's not an indication that the food here must be good. Please.. I learned that lesson long ago.  I had the pho #2.. which is everything but the meatballs. I was never big on vietnamese beef meatballs so thought I'd not include it. One thing that irked me a little was that my round beef slices came out pretty much fully cooked with a little bit of pink left. A tiny bit. I'll have to tell them next time to serve that on the side cuz I hate mine already well done when it comes out. I like it barely cooked... slowly turning cooked in my broth-to nearly raw. I ain't no white girl, nor some white washed pussy asian, I'm not reporting you to the public health department. I appreciate that the broth was that hot to cook it that fast but c'mon, at least ladle the broth around the raw beef. I'll forgive them this time on that. Next time, on the side! to make sure it doesn't come out well done.  Anyway, the broth was almost decent, not as fragrant as I would like. I didn't detect any star anise in it, and if there is then they need to use more and toast them. I enjoyed that I didn't have to add fish sauce to it. Just my usual hoison sauce, lime and lots of jalapenos. The meat selection was pretty good and the tendons were nice and soft. I just wished there was more but for 6.55- it's good enough. The noodles were also done right with just enough pull and bounce- praise the Lord they weren't gummy and mushy. There's nothing worse than overcooked rice noodles.

On the positive side,  my dining companion quite liked his chicken/peanut/pineapple dish, which was attractively plated with a ring of pale winter tomatoes.  The spring rolls were fine and fresh-made. Our server was nice and attentive, and he brought us a good-sized pot of tea within moments of us sitting down.

Although these weren't my ideal, I could definitely see them being another person's ideal spring roll. Go check them out if you like pork. I also got the veggie tofu soup.

A good pho joint has/is: -  supposed to be dirty -  they are supposed to throw the pho down with your water/tea -  you aren't supposed to see them again until you have to walk up and pay your bill unless you fire off aircraft flares  -  there is supposed to be an old Viet guy sitting in the corner finishing up his bowl, blowing snot all over a napkin while staring you down, and you stay slurping away.   -  it should be less than 10/person and thats when ordering other things in addition to the pho.   - There should be little number stickies on the table, as tempting as it may seem, DONT peel them off!  When your done walk up to the counter and tell them that number, they will give you the bill. - Double check your bill -  There should be a lot of viets there along with at least one gay white men(usually) couple, and maybe even a hipsterish/yuppish white couple that everyone else is wondering how they got into this part of town.   The above criterion aren't guarantees for success, but its a sure start.  Yeh I know this is the Midwest, but a pho joint is a pho joint.  Its always funny when people order extravagant at anyplace has the word 'pho' in the title.  At a Viet cuisine restaurant of course, but not a pho joint.   Overall it was decent, and out of the 4 I have eaten on this street so far, its been the better.  Plenty of ngo gai, broth was not clear but it was hot (I make sure always get my meat on the side to keep them raw, you always get hot broth), has msg, they didn't skimp out too much on the tripe.  sprouts and mint were fresh.  And of course, price, was roughly 6/bowl for an average size bowl, (think 3/4 Kim Long bowl) and the ice coffee is the actual drip, with milk no grind not pre made.  As with any rating of a pho joint.  I always have to eat there twice before I make the final verdict, but this one at least has me coming back a second time. **update**  On a recent visit, it seems they have been floating the larger noodles out there, probably to save a buck.  Yuck.  Still, its not Houston or Cali and its better still than most in the Chi, so as the saying on facebook goes, ""whatever I can get"" haha.",0.9769,0.868,0.088,0.043,0.45219279809443746
2007-12-27,1.0,"I cannot understand why anyone who knows anything about pho would EVER praise the broth at Pho Xe Lua.  My boyfriend and I have been pho-crazy for years, and we were surprised and disappointed that this restaurant's pho was the most inauthentic, saddest, saltiest disaster of a broth we've had.  No star anise flavor, no oxtail richness, only a triple-quadruple helping of old fashioned SALT.  In fact, the broth was SO salty and so one-dimensional, neither of us finished our pho.  A first for my boyfriend; a pretty frequent response for me, who deepened my love for pho in Paris, dining at Dong Hong (Belleville) and Song Huong (13th, Ave de Choisy), homes of delicious, wondrous, restorative, balanced pho, replete with brisket, savory complex flavors, mint, and sweet raw onions.   Yes, it's true that Pho Xe Lua's pho is less sweet and cloying than your standard Pho [insert 3 like numbers here] fare.  This might in fact account for certain comparative praisings.  But this pho was lackluster, the beef tasteless and seemingly from a freezer, and the noodles drowning in a broth you could use to gargle with if you had a sore throat--not to mention it being the color of the toilet bowl you encounter in the airport  several hours after a poor soul has forgotten to continue flushing one's diarrhea.   You just want to run away. There were also only sad, seemingly resigned, apathetic people in that restaurant.  And they bombard you with network soaps and fox news during the day on flat screens.   A slack-jawed half wit of a waiter took our order and scowled at us when I asked a question about soy milk. Yuck! One star because the herbs were fresh and contained culantro.",0.8837,0.773,0.131,0.096,0.5115940607012035
2007-12-11,5.0,"I tried the Pho at the following argyle restaurants: Pho 777, 888, 999. ( I figure the best pho places are called Pho something).  Pho Xe Lua takes  the cake for best broth and most plentiful ingredients in the bowl. They are the best Pho on Argyle, so 5 stars. As far as service goes, I've come to realize service at almost every argyle restaurant is just bad, Hai Yen and that new place Dong Kin(sp?) being notable exceptions. Just be prepared to flag the waiter down when you want to pay, and go pay at the counter.",0.8885,0.796,0.146,0.058,0.44101010101010096
2007-10-17,2.0,"This is a family run place that serves Vietnamese street food.  If that's what you're looking for, add two more stars to this rating.  But the other reviewers here have been breathtakingly generous with their ratings.  Here's a flawed comparison, but please, why does this place have nearly the same rating as Trotters? Trotter's isn't lit with fluoresent lighting, and if I recall you can't hear the buzz of an antique icemaker (which is in the dining room at Pho). If reviewers gush five stars for good restaurants and four stars for poor quality, the scale deserves but two stars.  One for bad, two for good. I love vietnamese food.  This place is just o.k.",0.8658,0.791,0.141,0.068,0.5424242424242425
2007-10-17,3.0,"I've just moved to Chicago and am looking for a regular pho place to haunt. I had to try this place because of the many good reviews it received on Yelp. The pho here was all right, but nothing special; however, the service was so abysmal I won't be going back. the fact that it was so empty on a Friday night should have tipped me off. We waited twenty minutes for our drinks and over half an hour for three dishes (and there were only three other diners in the entire place!). when the food arrived, one of the dishes was incorrect (turns out it belonged to the other table), so we waited a little bit more for its replacement. On top of that, I had to chase down a waiter to get the bean sprouts and basil for my pho (but the cilantro was a nice touch). bottom line: the food simply isn't good enough to put up with the waiting time. my favorite pho places elsewhere are always packed, but they never made me wait around like Pho Xe Lua did.",0.9092,0.861,0.099,0.04,0.5107310744810744

2007-06-20,4.0,"This was my first venture to a Vietnamese restaurant. I purposely went to the Argyle Street area looking for some Vietnamese pho. I vaguely remembered other Yelpers bragging about one of the restaurants in that area but I could not remember which one. I started to look for library so I could look on the Internet and find out what you all liked but I gave up on that idea because I thought it would take too long. So, I parked on Broadway, paid the meter and started walking.  I walked down a most of Argyle almost to Sheridan. As I looked in all the restaurant windows I saw Asian people eating at Pho Xe Lua. So, I thought it must be relatively authentic. I am only giving it four stars instead of five for two reasons: one is that I have nothing to compare it to... it might be the best out there but I have not eaten at any other Vietnamese restaurants; the other reason was that the service was pretty bad. I went in and I didn't know whether it was seat yourself or wait to be seated. So,I sat down and it was several minutes before a man came over and gave me a menu.  He also brought over some water. I looked over the menu and really didn't know what to order.  It was lunch so I didn't want to order a huge meal.  I wound up ordering be chicken pho and spring rolls. Well, the Spring Rolls never came but I wasn't  billed for them either.  I still would have liked to have tried them. The waiter first brought out a dish of bean sprouts, sliced jalapenos, a lime wedge, and basil greens.  This being my first outing to a Vietnamese restaurant I wasn't sure whether I should eat that as a salad or what.  I held off since I did not see any dressing or anything like that. (On a side note, there is a lazy Susan on the table that has several sauces from hot to barbecue style condiments.  Also on the Lazy Susan are forks spoons and chops sticks.) The chicken Pho came out and I tasted it.  It was extremely good.  The broth was flavorful, there were tons of noodles in it, and there was quite a bit of chicken.  I wound up putting the basil, jalapeno, and half of the bean sprouts in the soup.  I am not sure if that is what you are supposed to do, but that is what I did.  Since I like hot spicy food, I also put in some of the hot chili sauce.  It was excellent. Though I like hot spicy food, I do like refills on water or drinks that I am having.  It turns out that the man who originally served me had disappeared and some woman was walking around the restaurant helping other people.  I noticed a lot of people looking around for waitstaff, some of them raising hands not knowing what to do.  I needed my water refilled so basically I went up to the counter myself and asked someone.  They gladly refilled my water glass but I shouldn't have had to do that. Normally, I wouldn't expect a bowl of soup to fill me up.  I'm a pretty big guy and a pretty big eater.  However, I have to tell you that this bowl of soup is about the size of my head and filled with noodles and broth and chicken.  It alone is more than enough.  I got down pretty far to the bottom of the bowl but even I couldn't finish the whole thing.  It was extremely tasty, very filling and a wonderful dish.  I want to try the beef next time. Will I be back?  Absolutely.  Despite the poor service the food was awesome and for about $5.40 you get a bowl of soup that is to die for and more than enough to eat. I highly recommend this restaurant and would give it five stars if the service were exemplary.  I still say that you should go, just be cognizant of the fact that the service is pretty bad - it is not horrible, it just needs improvement.    As long as you know that going in you should be fine. Have a great time and I hope to see you there!",0.9972,0.81,0.139,0.051,0.6212063492063492

(its much tastier then it sounds trust me) their deconstructed spring rolls in a bowl are fantastic too.  they're pretty lax about coming to bring you your bill, its just easier to  go up to the counter and pay when you're ready to leave so try not to take it as a sign of bad service...i think its just the way they've done things for years.",0.9551,0.738,0.206,0.056,0.5904761904761905
2007-02-27,4.0,"Wow!  Very likely the best pho I've had ever.  The broth is delish and has so much more depth than other pho restaurants.  I almost feel like the next time I go elsewhere for pho, it might taste watered down =( The server asked us almost immediately about our order but we weren't quite ready and asked him to come back in a few minutes.  Unfortunately, it took us quite a few raising of the hands to flag him down again and for anything else we wanted. Based on food alone this place is hands down five stars.  I would highly recommend giving it a try the next time you're in the mood for pho.",0.686,0.816,0.115,0.069,0.42833333333333323

Their spring rolls are always pretty good, too and filling.  The chicken satay is good, too - haven't tried anything else - usually just stick to an appetizer and my bowl of pho.",0.9467,0.833,0.144,0.023,0.5727777777777779
