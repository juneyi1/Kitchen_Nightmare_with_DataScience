2017-08-18,2.0,"Green Zebra was a disappointing experience. My wife and I eat mostly vegetarian food and Green Zebra has a reputation as one of the finest vegetarian dining experiences in Chicago. However, I found the food, atmosphere, and service (although friendly) to be uninspiring and very mechanistic. Some details: * The burrata cheese that they used was not high-quality product. * One of the dishes was served with toast points that was clearly made from stale bread. * The atmosphere felt something like a college cafeteria. No white tablecloths and almost industrial or office furniture. * The hostess was wearing tennis shoes and a T-shirt and barely looked up from her book to seat us. If our meal had cost $50, then I would have found this experience to be a more acceptable experience. But it wasn't. Our meal cost us $120 (for two) and for that price, could go to many of our favorite restaurants that we know are delicious many times.

We also ordered the sunchoke tartare which we found a bit too salty but had an interesting texture. All in all I would recommend Green Zebra to my vegetarian and vegan pals. The only reason I would rate 4/5 was that the atmosphere left something to be desired, then again I acknowledge that we were there early on a Tuesday night which does not lend itself to a hopping night out!",0.937,0.806,0.161,0.033,0.5896825396825397

You'll need to order about three plates to satisfy an average appetite, so that should run your between $30 and $40, it's a fairly expensive night out if you drink wine.  I don't think the food prices are out of line given the high quality and originality of the cuisine, but never really felt comfortable.",0.9896,0.781,0.175,0.044,0.639064039408867
2017-05-12,4.0,"I actually visited Green Zebra twice in the same vacation, because I liked it so much.  It's a small space, but one that's set up in a way that each table feels intimate and not too close to the others.  The first visit was on an EXTREMELY rainy night, so it was rather subdued/quiet; the second visit, it was considerably louder, but that might have been because there was a large party celebrating at the same time.  Given how rainy it was on the first visit, I was pleased and surprised that such a small venue has a coat check.   The first time, I came with three friends.  It's a tapas type venue, so between the four of us, we got to try the majority of the menu. The food was AMAZING. My favorite by far was the mushroom pate; it was smooth and creamy and buttery, and the mostarda and radish slices that came with it were the perfect compliment.  I also really loved the lime cheesecake that didn't actually contain any cheese.  I would NEVER have known if the waiter hadn't told us! The drinks were excellent, as was the service.   The second time was slightly disappointing; after having raved about how great everything was, not all the dishes lived up to my enthusiasm.  The polenta was completely unseasoned and bland; the beech mushrooms were just not quite as good, and the cheesecake (my lovely cheesecake!) was offset on its crust so I didn't get any of it with my half.  That was my favorite part! The mushroom pate, however, was still just incredible, as was the beet poke salad.   Still.  Everyone at the restaurant is so friendly and pleasant and the food is so good. I'm not a vegetarian or vegan but I loved nearly everything and felt so satisfied afterward.  To quote Ferris Bueller: If you have the means, I highly recommend it.",0.9981,0.712,0.245,0.043,0.5891915836101882

It can be hard to go to an old favorite and realize that they don't even have a freaking veggie burger and your only choice is a salad and French fries. On a trip into the city we took the opportunity to look for a specifically vegetarian restaurant and found Green Zebra, which was billed as vegetarian fine dining. It certainly lived up to the advertisement.  The menu was extremely diverse. Since it was small plates, we had the opportunity to try a number of different items. My favorite was the beet poke. The mix of textures was fantastic. I never would have thought to prepare beets that way! I also really enjoyed the mushroom pate. It was as smooth and creamy as any meat pate.

So this applies to both herbivores and omnivores.  SERVICE: The service was phenomenal - our server was attentive and knowledgeable on the menu, and was able to recommend drinks and dishes. Our waters were kept full, and our plates were cleared in a timely fashion. Our food also came out at very reasonable times, which was very nice. FOOD: We ordered the mushroom pate, gnocchi (required an up-charge for the truffles, but well worth it), mushroom steak, and poached duck egg. All were AMAZING dishes in their own right, and it was even more impressive that they kept such consistency throughout the meal.  I'd recommend all, but I'd say the duck egg was my favorite. The dish was incredibly savory, and had such a unique flavor (not enough restaurants use duck egg!). The mushroom steak was my next favorite, followed by the mushroom pate and gnocchi (ironic that it actually cost us the most!).  We also ordered the fuji apples for dessert. Wasn't part of the plan, but we were so tempted by other tables! It was similarly delicious, and was different from typical desserts. The coconut pudding was so light and creamy, and would have been amazing on its own.  DRINKS: Between two people, we had the Painted Desert (lovely - tasted like a margarita!), Distant Sands (a very nice fruity drink), and Triple Crown (absolutely delicious, with a wonderful citrus aftertaste). As you can see, we loved all the drinks, and really appreciated how well-paired the liquors were.

2017-02-21,5.0,"For my birthday, I got together with five of my girlfriends and decided to splurge at Green Zebra. We were are all vegetarians, and were aware of the prices, portion sizes, and so-called rude staff before we went. Overall it was a delicious and relaxing experience that really opened my eyes to all kinds of new flavors and combinations. Ambiance/Decor: The environment was modern and relaxing, with soft seats and calming music. The seating was a little cramped, but the space felt very airy and open for being so small. Very hip. Service: As soon as we entered and made our way to the desk, the ladies at the desk were quick to attend to us. They were sweet, perky, and were quick to wish me happy birthday. The ""rude and stingy older blonde woman"" was very sweet, and brought us a plethora of complimentary dishes and drinks, including a round of cocktails, salad, and two desserts. Food came fairly quickly, and one at a time so we would have plenty of room for all of the plates.  Pretty much as soon as you would finish one dish, another one would arrive, so there was no waiting around.  Only have two minor complaints. Pretty much every time I took a sip of my water, it was refilled. I understand that they were trying to be efficient, but I like to log my water by the glass, and it was hard with her hovering around as we were trying to eat. Also, the bartender was a little moody. I never once saw him smile, and he didn't even try to make smalltalk with us as we waited for our drinks. Only asked what we wanted and turned away. However, no complaints about the drinks. Absolutely delish. Food: Each of us at the table ordered 2-5 dishes. The portions were fairly small, but I liked it, because I was able to try such a wide range of flavors. After drinks, food, and dessert, I was satisfied, but not full. I liked that. I was able to leave the restaurant and function, instead of just feeling inflated  and exhausted by too much food. Mushroom Pate: After reading many raving reviews about this, I ordered one and was pleasantly surprised. I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms, but the pate was smooth and melt-in-your-mouth buttery, with only a slight hint of mushroom. I'm not an enormous fan of butter (it makes my stomach hurt), but this was still delicious. Could use a bit more bread. Winter Vegetables: Delicious flavor with a huge ""wham!"" spice. I love that it was served on top of rice. This was probably my favorite dish. Palak Paneer: I was expecting your traditional paneer, but was pleasantly surprised. The bottom of the dish was coated with a delicious spinach puree, and topped with a spicy ginger and spinach salad. While different, it tasted just like palak paneer. Wow! Additionally, it was served with a delicious buttery wheat bread that I adored.  Cheese Plate: We shared this around the table. I was expecting a little more though, for the price. We got three fairly small hunks of cheese with not enough bread, although the grape marmalade was delicious and reminded me of apple butter. The cheese itself was good, but I've had much larger and better cheese plates for a similar or cheaper price.  Pineapple Upside Down Cake: Absolutely delicious and nostalgic, although I couldn't really taste the pineapple.  Also, we got a little complimentary ""chef's choice"" appetizer: five spoons of carrot puree with fresh ginger and spices. Yummy. Although we spent about $200, our dinner at Green Zebra was a delicious and memorable experience. Also, they have a seasonal menu that is always changing, so I would definitely come here again.",0.9991,0.727,0.216,0.056,0.5901147842056932

The dishes were either completely bland, very spicy, or too salty, and the combinations of food made no sense either. The worst was the beet dish. Little cubes of beets with wakame seaweed.  I'm a huge fan of seaweed, and I love salt, but they obviously didn't rinse the seaweed and it tasted like a salt lick drenched in sesame oil. Couldn't even taste the beet. It was disgusting, and when the waitress asked how everything was and I said it was too salty, she said, ""The people at that table over there had the same dish and they said it was the best thing they'd ever eaten.""  Suffice it say that I will not go back.

2017-01-31,3.0,"My friends and I recently visited Green Zebra for Chicago Restaurant Week. I hadn't been in several years and remembered being less than impressed by the food at that first visit. As far as the food was concerned, this visit wasn't much better. I ordered from the prix fixe menu and chose the vegan options. My favorite items were the gemelli and pineapple upside cake. The black bean chili and roasted beet salad was okay, and the winter vegetable tagine was flavorless.  That being said, the ambiance and service are excellent. This restaurant has so much promise, but currently serves bland vegan and vegetarian fare. Their ingredients are fresh, and the dish ideas are great; with the appropriate seasoning, both could be used to create an incredibly delicious menu.",0.9766,0.793,0.195,0.012,0.5561403508771929

It was packed when we went so we had to sit at the bar. The bartender was definitely not Mr. Personality, I don't think I seen him crack a smile once. However he was very professional and an amazing mixologist. The menu was kind of hard to follow with the drinks so I asked him for a suggestion, told him I like margaritas and he made me something similar that was amazing.  We ordered the cheese board as an appetizer, was very good. We each got a bowl of the black bean soup... will say it was cold, not the best.  I ordered the gnocchi it was to die for! only thing is again it was super tiny, wish there was more. My friend ordered the mushroom arancini which was also amazing, coming from someone who doesn't like mushrooms. Total for an appetizer, 2 soups, 2 entrees, and 3 drinks our total was $107.

Ambiance was ok at best.. It felt very stiff, like they were trying too hard to be this posh restaurant but not quite hitting their goal. Didn't feel warm and inviting. It was pretty quiet when we got there and I felt like we had to speak in hushed voices as to not disturb anyone. Free coat check was a plus!

Wait staff, bus staff, kitchen staff, host staff they are seriously on top of anything and everything more so than any other restaurant I've tried. This place is vegetarian only and all of the portions are real tapas, meaning will definitely want to order several things, but it's perfect because it's pretty much impossible to choose between all the amazing options.

I'm still not quite there, but I could easily live this lifestyle if I dined at Green Zebra every day! First off, this is not a cheap place to eat. Luckily, we purchased an online gift certificate which helped ease the pain of the final check. The portions are small so we each had 3-4 dishes each. That being said, every single dish was better than the next.  The mushroom pate is an absolute must! I was not excited about this dish because I hate pate and mushrooms also aren't my favorite but my partner wanted this. It had an earthly flavor to it and did have hint of mushroom taste but it was like silky butter. We honestly contemplated ordering a second and skipping dessert.  I love that they have a seasonal menu. We had a lot of watermelon options since we dined in August. We had a very light and summery gnocchi dish that is no longer on the menu. Also, the poached egg was to die for!  Lastly, the atmosphere is absolutely stunning. Even down to the vintage cocktail glasses, this place has thought of everything.

Portions seemed smaller (and prices higher) and service not as exceptional as it once was. I think they are well-liked because Chicago doesn't really have a comparable place offering what they do, but coming from L.A., it wouldn't last here the way it's operating (over-priced, mediocre service). Almost everything we had was quite tasty, I just wish there was more of it. The squash blossoms most notably were super stingy - just two blossoms on the plate (for four people = half a blossom). The gnocchi were tasty but not worth $22, the most expensive item on the menu and not readily apparent why. The buckwheat pasta was probably our favorite, and I really loved the mushrooms with kimchi. The mushroom pate was awesome, but could be served with most crostata (we requested more). Corncake and shishitos were okay, but nothing special. The cheese plate at dessert was a joke! Three super thin slices of cheese for $14. Just absurd. Perhaps more absurd than that? $11 beer in a can. I would expect a place of this caliber to serve a draught, or at least a bottle. And at the least, to mark on the menu if it's a can - my fiancé was shocked when they put it before him.   I recall the portions here used to really be share-worthy. Now, many of the plates really are best designed for one-person, not to share. And our server (older gentleman) could have been friendly - his expression every time we dealt with him was pretty icy.

Our server was well informed but I felt she could have attended to our needs better whether it was getting the check or grabbing chili flakes.  As for the food:  I definitely recommend 'hen of the woods' (mushroom pâté): was the most memorable, granted as a vegetarian my entire life I can't compare to the real thing, but it was smooth and melted in your mouth and the raspberry sauce on the side contrasts so well with the buttery pâté.

2016-07-06,5.0,"GREEN ZEBRA IS KING-PART 2 Another never miss at Green Zebra is any form of gnocchi that they bless us by offering. We have never been disappointed in their gnocchi. Gnocchi is a seemingly technically simple ingredient to master. It has so few ingredients: potato, flour, egg. But very few truly master it. A skilled chef friend of ours, whose gnocchi are pretty much the best on the planet, always admonishes that the key is simply not overworking the dough. Something I clearly cannot master. The Green Zebra chefs must have gotten the memo because their presentation is always that perfect combination of gentle, ""toothsome"" chewiness and seemingly incongruent light, float-off-the-plate fluffiness. The dish never misses at Green Zebra. One final kudos before running into my primary nemesis in life, the word limit, goes out to the beet tartare. Based upon that much maligned root vegetable which generates the same sort of vehement disagreement as vegetarianism versus 'meatatarianism' (or Democrat versus Republican), it always gives us pause for wonder about how much can be done with this humble ingredient. The tartare reminds us how much we love the beet's ""earthy goodness"" (the ""earthiness"" apparently being the primary source of the controversy between beet lovers and haters). The pairing with yogurt and sweet nuts compliments the earthiness so well that it makes my mouth water for beets as I type this!..and they are not yet ready in my garden...but I have some still in the freezer from last year's! In closing, I would be remiss to not mention a fine beverage selection and wonderful staff. For any of their tastings, Green Zebra offers skillfully prepared and interesting beverage pairings. The bartender also spins up some pretty tasty and creative cocktails: we never miss them. If you prefer not to take the opinion of the experts about pairing flavors, the bottle selection is also very reasonable and well thought out. Switching now to the staff, they are awesome, helpful, and accessible. Ask for recommendations. Each will have a favorite(s) and willingly share why. They are wonderful and welcoming. In short, Green Zebra gets our vote for champion of vegetarian cuisine. Though, that description is too limiting and unfair to their skills. Green Zebra is simply a champion culinary experience. They go quietly and professionally about their business of expert preparation and presentation of vegetables, doing so very successfully considering the long run that they have had. We regret originally waiting so long to first try Green Zebra and each time we go for not visiting more often. You will not suffer for flavor. You will not walk away hungry (our eyes are always bigger than our stomachs and something goes home with us). You will walk away very satisfied and happy and with more money in your pocket because Green Zebra, despite having a ""high-end"" flair and feel, will typically come in cheaper than an equivalent meal at most any other comparable restaurant in town. We have nothing but praise for Green Zebra's execution of this wonderful concept! Sorry for the delay in finishing this but Yelp gets mad at me when I don't fit their word limit and won't let me post a second review for the same restaurant too close to the first one...but what if I am a rich guy and go there EVERY day!  :)  ...BTW, I'm not!",0.9937,0.813,0.145,0.042,0.5204190476190476

The tables were practically on top of each other, and it was nearly impossible for my dinner companions to get in and out. But OH MY GOD THE FOOD. It was literally the second best meal I've eaten in my life (topped only by the kitchen table experience at Corner Table, where they cook you dishes until you tell them to stop). Each dish was so unique and amazing, with new flavors to surprise even our jaded foodie palates. Even the non-vegetarians with us were blown away by the flavor and creativity exhibited in every course. The Hen of the Woods pate is a must try for any mushroom lover. I never dreamed a non-meat pate could be so divinely melt-in-your-mouth decadent. And the Bourbon Cherry Sour the expert and very charming bartender made was perfect.

The exterior of the building is antique looking; while the interior is modern, setting up a nice juxtaposition.  The lightning was perfect, subdued and flattering. The layout was a bit odd, but I liked it; great use of the small space. As we looked over the menu, I ordered a cocktail, the Rum-Rye Old Fashioned. The server brought everyone's non-alcoholic drinks and forgot my libation.  I didn't receive mine until the entrees arrived. Strike one! The hostess/manager made up for our servers folly by scrounging up some Tater tots (not on the menu), and served them to the picky youngster we had dinning with us. He was happy, and she was a sweetheart. I really liked her vibe. Dinner was an event. Some of the items I recall ... Roasted Globe Eggplant Dip Braised Chickpea Tagine  Cashew Masala The food was really good but the portion size was a bit small for my tastes. We kept ordering MORE. When it came time for desserts, we ordered coffee as well, but it didn't come out until after we finished two rounds of desserts. Strike two!

We considered the tasting menu but there were so many things we wanted to try that we opted to go a la carte.  What we ordered: Hen of the woods (mushroom pate)- Very good and highly recommended. Unique appetizer. Green Papaya Salad- crunchy, fresh, also very good Fresh Hawaiian Heart of Palm- very lightly dressed, I love heart of Palm so I enjoyed this salad Shiitake and Oyster Mushroom soup- my husband's order. He seemed to enjoy it. His comments, ""good but not phenomenal"" Entrees: Braised Chickpea Tagine- My husband's order. He liked it but wished that the rice was seasoned a little more. ""Average"" Gnocchi- really good but we don't know why it's called gnocchi. It's not a pasta. The ""gnocchi"" part was actually a square piece of polenta. It came with a poached egg.

For food, we ordered the Hen of the Woods (mushroom pate), Scarlet Beets, Gnocchi alla Romana, and the Roasted Globe Eggplant Dip. Of the dishes, the star was the mushroom pate like other Yelpers have said. It's hard to describe the dish other than delicious creamy goodness smeared on toasted rounds.

2016-03-30,3.0,"Came last night for the first time with a  gilt.com  deal ($40 for 2 drinks and 4 menu items). Overall I would say it was... ok. I honestly have had better vegetarian food at normal non-veg restaurants. I didn't think anything here was that special. The ambiance is nice, and service was good. Server, hostess, bartender all very friendly. But food wise - mushroom pate was probably the best thing we had all night. Roasted acorn squash was not good. It was a slice of roasted squash, served on a square of who knows what- something dry and crumbly and flavorless.  My friend and I both didn't like it. Potstickers/dumplings were ok. Cashew masala was good- not great, but good. We also ordered dessert- the chocolate cremeaux, which again was good but not memorable. There was nothing I ate and thought, WOW this is great! Also portions are small. Really small. If I didn't use that gilt deal I would have thought this place was way overpriced. I am glad I tried it, and maybe one day I'd go back and try again, but I'm not in a hurry. Also- I had checked my coat, and when I got home, there were stains of (what looks like) tomato sauce, or berries or something, in little marks all over the collar and the back of my coat.

2016-03-24,4.0,"So just to let you readers know that I am not vegetarian nor vegan. We brought my vegan sister here and thought we should go here for the experience. It was a little empty inside, but I loved the ambience. We ordered a total of 10 dishes for 3 people.  First, we started off with an amuse-bouche of watermelon radish and some kind of squash?  Then we continued with the mains: Hens of the Woods - mushroom pâté. My favorite! Smooth and creamy pâté.  Cashew masala - not enough spiciness and zing for me, but I recommend this if you like Indian. Roasted globe eggplant dip - this was pretty good, kind of tasted like salsa. A-plus because it was served with pieces of naan.  Braised chickpea tagine - this tasted a little similar to the eggplant dish, but it was still delicious with the rice. Spring artichoke soup - served with black sesame dinner roll??? The bread was delicious, but the soup was a bit too sour and lemony. It was good, but it could've been better and easier to digest if they toned down the lemon. Healthy harvest poached hen's egg - another favorite the sourdough crouton was a bit too oily and the potato puree was a bit salty. But I like how they incorporated the potato puree and the poached egg together in the plate. They taste great together with the crouton. Highly recommended!!!! Za'atar roasted acorn squash - this was yummy, but not my favorite. I'm not a fan of roasted squash because they taste bitter to me. But the amazing thing is that it didn't taste bitter at all. This had a chewy, potato gnocchi-like texture, so I didn't think it was squash. It also didn't taste bitter, and it tasted like sweet potatoes to me. I didn't know squash could taste this good! Gnocchi alla romana - a simple dish. Huge, thick gnocchi came with a poached egg. This one was just decent.  Dessert: Coconut rice pudding - rice pudding was on point! Came with pineapples. Lime cheesecake - free, complimentary dessert. Very tart which I LOVE! You must order this one if you're not really into sweets.  Chocolate cremeaux - cassis sorbet really made it up for me since I'm not a fan of sweets like chocolate. The sorbet and chocolate pairs up very well. Overall, I am very impressed with this restaurant. Vegans/vegetrians and non-vegans/vegetarians should really try this place.

2016-03-23,1.0,Honest review: the food wasnt that good i feel this restaurant trys way to hard to do something different and unique and fails miserably. for the portions they give n the price they charge the food should be amaizin n its not. The best dishes were the burrata and the two desserts the service was alright not the best wasnt the worst i was really sad because i actually really do love vegetables n this restaurant was highly over exaggerated imma try mana food bar to see if its better  Mushroom soup: i love soups so whenever i go out to eat i order one this was terrible it was very hard to pretend that i like it. First off the mushrooms that were inside were so overcooked it was like chewing on gum the texture was so un appetizing picture like overcooked seafood. The flavor of the actual soup was very one not not flavorful at all. I was thinking it be really rich with a great umami flavor with alot of depth of flavor but i was wrong. It tasted like the can of mushroom soup just worse. Then goat cheese was the wrong choice for the soup just was a really odd combination. This dish needed something crunchy maybe fry the mushrooms instead or have some croutons Kimchi dumplings: i love dumplings my favorite thing is when their deep fried. Ik alot of people like their traditional texture of dumplings but when their fried i love it their so crunchy! The filling wasnt what i expected. It said kimchi but it tastes more like cabbage i was expecting a spicy vinegary taste that wasnt there. The filling was very average so i was disappointed. However the sauce was so flavorful. The black garlic soy-sauce is like nothing u ever had before so rich like u will want to lick the bowl. I would avoid the scallions though there a lil bit to much that raw onion flavor over powers the dish Burrata: if u love cheese u will love this dish. If u like the Italian pepper n onions u will adore this because thats basically what it is. The sweetness of the peppers goes perfectly with the burrata. Then all the onions and garlic such a beutiful combination. Like this was my favorite dish of the night it was so flavorful. The only issue is that its not served with bread. They serve it with chips n the dish is to heavy weight wise for the chips so that was a bad idea. The chips were stale to so thats another bad thing. Plz serve toasted bread with this dish!!  Masala cashew: the nuts was a really good idea. Like instead of meat u get crunchy nuts n that was a really good idea. I liked the cauliflower a nice added pickled touch to give the dish pop. The problem was the masala sauce wasnt really flavorful like i was expecting a really flavorful sauce with alot of indian spices n it was just a normal tomato sauce really was dissapointed. For the price i felt it was way to much for just nuts Potato and Wisconsin cheddar pave: the actual potato was good but under seasoned i wish it was more crispy only the top of it is crispy n that would have made it taste so much better. This was actually a good dish though but it needed more sauce like i understand presentation is important but u have to put more sauce. I really liked the greens though good i liked this better then the masala dish Divine mud imperial stout cake: im not a coffee person but this was amaizing like i could not stop eating it. The cake is supper moist and has a beautiful coffee flavor. The cranberries were perfect it added a nice acidic note to offset the sweetness of the dish. The sauce is really good.the ice cream was so good i would come back just for this dish Chocolate cremeaux: the cake is supper fluffy and moist then there is this chocolate mouse that is phenominal omg omg omg so fucking good just order this youll thank me later,0.9986,0.672,0.219,0.109,0.5961322301729279

Thank God I just checked it out because honestly nothing really interests me in your RW menu now, so I am going to cancel my reservation and dine elsewhere.

Additionally I was planning on ordering one of the two items left and that was an equally hard decision. I am not faulting you for changing your menu due to seasonal changes and availability which I can understand may have happened on your regular menu, however knowing that a seasonal change is on the horizon means you should have waited to post and publicize it. The moral of my complaint is, if you don't have a menu prepared for Choose Chicago when they put the menus on their site in January then don't post one.

I cannot say the same for Green Zebra, where not only was the quality great, but it was the right amount. As a vegetarian, I'm happy to know I've got GZ as an option. The staff were kind as well and it was decently priced. We had about five-six plates, each varied differently to feel like it was a small culinary adventure.

2015-10-24,2.0,"Oh Green Zebra, what high expectations I had of you. I was so excited to visit and taste this vegetarian cuisine but was truly disappointed by the entire experience. Let's start from the beginning. The ambiance is enjoyable, although a little warm. We waited no longer than 10 minutes for our table, with a reservation. We never received our waitress' name but she did ask if we had ever been before. Both my date and I had not been. She did not tell us anything we could not read on the menu, no recommendations, etc. The drink menu is decent and I ordered ""It tastes like fall"" which was delicious just pretty weak alcohol level speaking and my date ordered a beer.   As a vegan, I inquired about the vegan options, if the non-vegan ingredient was omitted from the dish or if there was a different version. I learned that the ingredient was omitted which struck me as odd because as short yet specialized their menu is, it seemed strange they would want to omit for example, horseradish yogurt from a dish when that flavor should have been the star. With that in mind, we ordered the Beets by Dre and it was ok. My non-vegan date thought it was good without the horseradish yogurt. The Marinated Kale salad (V) was quite delicious, the best thing I had. The Smoked red bean dumplings just tasted like mashed, unflavored red beans in a dumpling.. Super disappointing.  The Country flatbread, again, was OK, but seriously lacking flavor. I was most excited for this because I am a huge fan of curry flavor but I could make something better at home. My date had the mushroom risotto and thought it was very good.  When the check came, we told the waitress we were debating on having a port or not. No recommendations and didn't give us a minute to decide, she just brought the check. There was absolutely no up-selling or anything. It seemed as though she didn't care to be there which really affected our visit.  The kicker is that our bill was around $85 and we put a $100 bill with the check. The waitress came by to pick it up, did not ask if we needed change, said nothing actually and NEVER RETURNED. Let me just say that having had been in the industry for years, I tip very well for good service and food so had it been a good experience, she would have gotten a 20%+ tip, but this was the bare minimum I did not feel badly about leaving her. Sadly I do not believe I will return.",0.9948,0.74,0.178,0.082,0.5521666666666668

I'm vegetarian, and she's vegan; Green Zebra is 100% vegetarian with more than half the menu available as vegan.  Below are the drinks/dishes we tried with individual comments.Everything is ""shareable"", but I definitely recommend 3 plates per person (plus dessert). Taste of Fall Cocktail - 3/5 Stars, Nothing special, it did taste/smell like spiced cider, not too weak or too strong. Hen of The Woods Mushroom Pâté - 5/5, Awesome. Hands down best dish, light mushroom mousse served with raspberry preserves and spicy pickled fennel. Hard to share, get your own! Grilled Gem Lettuce Salad - 4/5, It's a successful salad, good starter, nothing out-of-this-world Artichoke Soup - 1/5, We both did not like it, we ate less than 1/4 of the bowl. It was very salty and lemony, like someone mixed Pinesol, vinegar, and salt.  Smoked Red Bean Dumplings - 3/5, I remember eating these but don't particularly remember what they tasted like. The drizzled sauces were the highlight of this dish. Easy to share Spicy Szhechuan Tofu - 4/5, Pickled mushrooms, sauteed bok choy, and spicy tofu on a bed of rice, overall pretty tasty.  Country Flatbread - 4/5, If you like Indian flavors this one is for you. Mashed curried dahl on flatbread. Easy to share. Upside-Down Peach Cake - 5/5, moist sweet cake with basil ice cream and whiskey caramel, I had to share.   Seasonal Sundae - 3/5, seasonal flavor was lemon sorbet with grapefruit caramel and graham crackers. The graham crackers brought this dish down, they tasted burnt, and not in a good way. Sorbet was great.  Ambiance is relaxed and quiet, good date spot that seems to draw a regular vegetarian crowd. Groups larger than 6 may have trouble finding a table.

2015-08-24,1.0,"I started with high hopes because the Green Zebra came highly recommended by a friend of mine. I confirmed this with another couple who have different tastes. If two different types of people like a vegetarian restaurant then it has to be good. I don't know if we were eating at the same restaurant.  Let's start with the thing most people care about, the food. It started well with the pretzel roll. I think a little overpriced at 3 dollars but it did have a nice flavor and the butter it came with was rather tasty. Then we moved onto the corn soup. The wife and I had it and we both enjoyed it immensely. This was the high point of the meal. The 3 main courses we shared fell right to the floor. The tofu was hard and had no flavor. It was marketed as Szechuan style but had less flavor than McDonalds. The gnocchi was ok. Sure it might be home made but when the sauce is salted up in bunches it really detracts from the taste. The final dish was the flatbread. If you like burnt bread this is perfect dish for you. Flavors the like you've had at every terrible overcooked restaurant.  Sadly this wasn't even the worst part of the meal.  The service. The service here ranks up there in the worst places I've ever eaten at.  We saw our server a total of 8 times during the entire meal. 3 of those times was at the end of the meal when the server was giving us the bill. I saw the bussers more often than the server. So why did we start counting? Our menus sat on the table for 10 minutes with the server passing by us many times to visit another table. The server visited the table to serve that table additional orders from their bar all the while our menus were sitting at the corner of the table waiting for our order.  Once we ordered, we got ignored once again. Bread course, no server. Soup, no server. Main course, server comes by once we've had a total of 2 bites and we say we just started. Once we are almost done, she comes by and asks us how the meal is and I reply ""only ok"". She takes this and doesn't ask why it was only ok and was a step away from the table before I finished.  Our empty plates sit on front of us for another 5 minutes before a busser sees it and cleans it off the table. Then we wait again for the dessert menu which gets passed to us, closed, without a perfunctory explanation on what is good and what is a special.  We pass on dessert and now we see the server. 3 times in 5 minutes because she is getting money.  Executive Summary - We won't be going back. We won't be recommending Green Zebra. I hope you as the reader find a different place to spend your dollars because we wasted ours.  ****SPECULATION FOLLOWS***** This paragraph is just speculation and should be taken as such.  We were the only asian couple our server had. The two white couple tables the server was handling were handled much more quickly and much more professionally. The table in front of us had the server by 4 times asking about their food.

We show up on Saturday night 15 minutes before our reservation.  We have plenty of time before our subsequent plans, so we are looking forward to it despite the lack of communication.  After an hour and 15 minutes of waiting, we tell them that we are just going to head out.  We are both irritated.  Places get busy, especially good ones.  But a place that charges that much per person should respect reservations.  The woman that we've been talking to comes out and apologizes, asking if we still want to see the room that is for rent.  I think 'no,' and my fiancee says ""yes,"" so we head upstairs to their side room.  They didn't have the heat on in there, and there is one large table covered in a table cloth with a bunch of wine stains.  She says ""this is it"" as I gear up to resume operation-leave-this-place.  I think she knew something was amiss because she then started trying to be ultra accommodating, asking if we just wanted to be seated up there right now instead.  We go back and forth but decided to stick it out.  She turns the heat on, throws some additional tablecloths over the stains and runs out to her car to grab her iPod for the iHome.  Keeping in mind that it's just us in a cold, completely detached room at a table made for maybe 16 people, we sit and wait, awkwardly.  She comes back in and asks if other people can come in and sit up there with us.  We reluctantly say yes, and in stream a few groups.  Some of them see how awkward it is, and decide to stick out the wait (or maybe just leave instead).  They leave and the remaining take their seats, awkwardly.  No from that point on, it improved.  They finally got a few staff up there to help us out, and threw in some extra food without cost.  She apologized, and was doing her best to make amends.  It just was not at all what we were hoping for, and we missed our plans because this all took so very long. We did not decide to go with them for our brunch.  If you were wondering, we did receive the email a week after this whole thing.  She may have noticed it was caught up somewhere, and resent it...we will never know.",0.9286,0.894,0.062,0.045,0.4728947368421053

2015-07-07,2.0,"This was my second experience at Green Zebra.  I had been there a few years back, found it to be a bit too pretentious but that was years ago and could have been a bad waitress. My husband and I have been visiting different restaurants every week for date night.  He recently proclaimed that despite all the vegetarians in the area (we are both veg), most restaurants only offer 1 or 2 options.  So I checked yelp reviews and made a reservation here for his birthday on 7/2/15. We walked in on time, the hostess found our reservation after a few minutes and greeted my husband with a cheerful ""Happy Birthday"" (I mentioned it in the open table notes).  She brought us to the table and handed him a menu that even had Happy Birthday on the top - so cute!   The waitress greeted us and said Happy Birthday (so great!) And that was the end of the goodness.  The waitress took a very long time to return with our drinks.  For dinner, she recommended 2-3 choices each.  I asked her input on a couple items and took her recommendations.  Only to be told on a return trip that they were out of the gnocchi and the fiddleheads with yukon potatoes.  Its a vegetarian restaurant and it was early in the evening. You have a very limited menu.  Run out and buy more veggies.  It can't be that difficult.  I understand being out of steaks, etc but gnocchi is quick to make and yukon potatoes are easily accessible.  But determined not to sour a fun evening, we plowed on and placed our orders. My husband ordered a salad, soup and an entree.  I ordered a soup, entree and a side. My soup arrive the same time as his salad.  Then his soup came out when I received my entree and my side.  Leaving us to wait quite a long, awkward, thirsty time for his meal. I had finished my prosecco during the soup.  Our waitress came and retrieved my glass and walked away promptly without offering/asking if I would like another drink.  Moments later she did the same to my husband.  So we sat there, waiting on our food, no drinks on the table.  And I was feeling just horrible as this was quickly turning into a lame birthday dinner.  She did not come back and offered no opportunity to order a drink with dinner. When his dinner arrived, he ate quickly and we asked for the check.  Still with no beverages on the table.  It was his birthday!  She knew this, she acknowledged it when we sat down.  I was prepared to order several rounds of drinks and dessert.  Instead we both left really disappointed.   Overall it was just lame.  I can't find another word for it.  We typically have a lot of fun with our servers at restaurants but this was just a bust.  And I am planning a re-do birthday dinner for this week at another location, It was that bad. As for the food...it was fine.  Not great, just fine.  Nothing memorable or interesting.  Sadly, I would not recommend it.  I really wanted to love it too.",0.9804,0.774,0.135,0.091,0.5045167233560091
2015-07-04,4.0,"Standout Dish: Burrata alla Panna- creamy burrata cheese is offset by pumpernickel croutons and cut by a strawberry jam.  oh so tasty. Green Zebra is a necessary destination for Chicago vegetarians. The food is high concept and tasty even for non-veg standards. The dishes are small plates that run between $8- $14 a plate, so a full dinner with wine can be quite pricey. The restaurant recommends 3 dishes per person, but you can get two per person and leave full, but not stuffed, especially if you get dishes on the rich side. The salads on the first half of the menu are tasty, but small. They burrata and mushroom pate are musts- Well constructed dishes with great compliments in the pickles and moustardas. The kale salad was tasty, but a rather small serving. The fuller dishes are great. The side of Foraged Maitake Mushroom is great- they are meaty and served with a dressing strong on the soy sauce.  The polenta was creamy and glorious.  However, here is my criticism- the full entree-style dishes seemed to rely on heavy uses of butter and soy sauce to substitute for flavor or overpower the vegetables presented. The polenta was tasty, but so creamy that it felt like eating a stick of butter. So you can bring your non-veg friends here, but don't expect it to be some health food journey. Service was spotty and inconsistent. I think we had three different servers check in on us over the course of the meal. It also seemed that they dragged out the service of the first course so that our table would finish and then order a bottle of wine (conjecture, but they asked about that bottle of wine twice before serving any food).",0.9928,0.828,0.147,0.025,0.5678333333333334

2015-06-20,3.0,"Green Zebra has nice ambiance but the food falls short. In an era when vegan food reigns supreme and where restaurants like Vedge in Philadelphia, Sutra in Seattle, Shojin in Los Angeles and even NEXT in Chicago offer delicious and cutting-edge vegan foods, the retrograde, pedestrian vegetarian (not vegan) menu of Green Zebra seems hopelessly dated and sad. We started with the ""chilled somen noodles"" ($10) and the ""beets by dre"" ($10). The somen noodles was the best dish of the night, featuring a delicate balance of soybeans and hearts of palm in a nice ginger soy sauce. The beets by dre had golden and red beets with greens in a sauce that was just too sharp for my likes. Next we had the mung bean potstickers ($10) and the spicy marinated tofu ($11). The potstickers were dry and starchy and didn't hit the spot; the spicy marinated tofu was a simple stir-fry, and tasted okay, but wasn't particularly fancy or interesting (the Chinese take-out joint down the road could do the same dish for half the price). We also got a side of foraged maitake mushrooms ($8) which came in a generous portion size, but its soy sauce marinade overpowered the dish. We passed on dessert because the only had a vegan sorbet (honestly, in 2015 sorbet is the best vegan dessert you can come up with?!) and a peanut butter panna cotta that didn't look too interesting. The service was mostly efficient but not particularly friendly.  All told, if you're looking for a good, hearty vegan or vegetarian meal in Chicago I'd look elsewhere.",0.9931,0.775,0.185,0.04,0.5006784434203789

The noodles were perfectly presented with a sprinkle of edamame on top.   My dinner companion loved the gnocchi with mushrooms spinach and sun dried tomatoes.  I also have to say that the service was friendly and attentive.  From other reviews you probably know this is a vegetarian restaurant with vegan options.  So many of the vegan/veg restaurants in Chicago mainly offer faux meat options to typical meat dishes.  The food at Green Zebra is beautifully prepared and delicious, and doesn't rely on meat substitutes.  The food is fresh, creative and is based on gorgeous produce, herbs, spices, and beautifully made sauces.   Overhead Aimee Mann was playing and there was performance art happening across the street.  I had a great experience at Green Zebra.  Head over to West Town and get Zen.",0.9984,0.726,0.274,0.0,0.6185714285714285

2015-06-11,2.0,"To all my friends here on Yelp: please gather 'round. I have a story to share. Let me begin by stating that I am a vegetarian, and a mostly vegan. I am not stating this to brag.  Generally speaking, and in response to the popular joke, I think if a person does CrossFit and is a vegan, he or she will speak about veganism first. It is an elitist culture that I am often annoyed to be a part of, and yes, I miss variety.  So imagine my excitement about trying Green Zebra. Rumors from The Vegans whispered to me that if I ate enough of Green Zebra's endless combinations of vegetables, I would eventually be able to live on photosynthesis alone.  I said yes, I would like to be a plant. Let's go. My law school graduation on Sunday, May 17 presented the perfect occasion. My family, Ohioans to the core, flew in from out of town to cheer for me as I became a Knight of the Law. Please keep in mind they are extremely Midwest, meat and potatoes kind of people. This is what they are used to, and this is what they like. And it is perfectly reasonable and great to love meatloaf and to be a less adventurous eater. They kept very open minds and hearts and were similarly excited to try a vegetable-only meal. I think my little brother even tucked his button-up shirt into his khakis for the occasion. My mom Googled ""what is tempeh?"" Everyone was prepared. We arrived at the restaurant. I'm pretty sure it was a chic color palette. There were plants around, which made me slightly uncomfortable, as they were going to witness my family and I eating their brethren. We arrived on time for our reservation and were seated shortly thereafter.  That is when we were introduced to our waitress, who I believe (although I cannot confirm) is either a manager or the owner.  Her name was (and most likely still is) Elizabeth. ""Nice to meet you, Elizabeth,"" my khaki-d family said.  We looked at the menu, and many things immediately popped out to me as sounding delicious, specifically the mushroom pate. I let my nervous but still willing family peruse the menu. We ordered cocktails. We laughed a little. Elizabeth floated over and explained a concept that many vegetarians are used to, but many carnivores may not be- the meals were smaller than entrée size, but larger than tapas size. Many people order 2-3 dishes in order to form a complete meal for themselves.  ""Fine, Elizabeth,"" we stated, in unison. Then it came time to order. I went first. And then the most unfortunate incident began to happen. As my family began to order, they coincidentally all wanted the same thing: the gnocchi.  After the Second Gnocchi Order, I could see Elizabeth was visibly becoming angered.  After the Third Gnocchi Order came out of my sweet mother's mouth, Elizabeth couldn't take it anymore. She put her hand up, palm facing our table, and she stopped the ordering process dead in its tracks.  With a very condescending (typical vegan) attitude, she accused us of ordering wrong.  We could not possibly all get or want the gnocchi.  That The Point of The Restaurant was to order everything or most things on the menu all at the same time in order to eat all the things.  We could not continue to order in this embarrassing manner.  This tiny talking-to went on for an awkward amount of time, probably upwards of 45 seconds. My family looked down in shame, and I mean that literally. Faces reddened. No one could look at Elizabeth.  Except I could, because I now have a J.D., and I had enjoyed a cocktail.  I told Elizabeth to stop speaking to my family in that way and if we wanted other items after our first round of items, we would discuss that and then simply order them.  Elizabeth then implied that the restaurant might be out of those other items by that time. I started laughing. My family continued to stare down. I reassured Elizabeth that yes, we had been to a restaurant before, and yes, we did want all the gnocchi.  As the rest of my family ordered (The Gnocchi), she shook her head side-to-side while she wrote it down, ashamed of our bumpkin ways.  In a panic, my kindly, now-sweating father made a last-ditch effort to make us cool; he quickly ordered one artichoke soup and 5 spoons. We all took one bite. The food was delicious. My meat-eating family loved it. What I do not, and will not EVER tolerate in a restaurant are three simple things: 1. Airs of snobbery, 2. Making my family feel as if they are not worthy of being there, and 3. Bugs.   I will say, to Elizabeth's credit, she may have realized the error of her ways towards the end of the meal, as she brought us out a round of champagne on the house.  We toasted to entitlement complexes everywhere. To Green Zebra's credit, my family has now started a new tradition wherein we all collectively shake our heads in shame at whatever the orderer's order is.  Tsk tsk, you little bumpkin.  Tsk tsk. To future patrons of Green Zebra: beware.  Condescension awaits you, but the pate is delicious.",0.9773,0.806,0.116,0.078,0.5723637308458736

2015-05-15,4.0,"We were pleasantly surprised by our meal and the wine at Green Zebra this week. The mushroom pate is as creamy and flavorful as all others have stated. One suggestion would be that they serve it with toasted bread and not soft slices so that there is more of a mouth-feel contrast. The pickled fennel was a bit too strong and overpowering. The marinated spicy tofu was well seasoned and flavorful - a rarity with tofu dishes! The Grilled Gem Lettuce Salad was very flavorful and filling with lots of avocado and a fire-breathing garlic dressing that was almost (not quite, but almost) too strong. The Chilled Somen Noodles were a real disappointment. There were perhaps two bites of this dish that were correctly seasoned with the dressing and had flavor - the rest was a cold and slimy pile of overcooked somen that literally was hard to eat. We cannot recommend this dish. We asked for salt and the server never brought it. A shame because it might have helped to like it a bit. The frittatta again was lacking flavor - salt mostly, however the sauteed potatoes and other veggies under it were well seasoned and helped carry the dish. The Creamy White Corn Polenta was one of the best dishes we tasted. Extremely creamy - almost like farina in texture with bits of sauteed veggies on top it was a comfort dish for sure. It had the right amount of seasoning. For dessert the Rich Vanilla Custard was all of that and then some. Very rich with good amount of sweetness and a visually pleasing presentation with the honey tuile strip rising to the sky. The chocolate fudge-like bar with hazelnut ice cream was rather 90's. The shredded cake pieces looked odd and had little flavor. There was not enough ice cream for the amount of other items on the plate.

2015-05-12,5.0,"I'm not sure what all the mixed reviews are about because this was honestly one of the better (if not best) meals I've had in Chicago. My boyfriend and I decided to go for my birthday, so we knew we would be ordering a lot. If you're looking for recommendations on how much to order, you should scale back because we were completely stuffed and had leftovers. These are my thoughts on the dishes we had (in order, numbered according to when they were served): 1) Mushroom paté: if you don't order the paté, you are doing something wrong. This was the most delicious paté I have ever had (even compared to the real stuff). I know, I know, it was heavy on the butter, which helps any dish reach great heights, but the execution was just flawless. It was incredibly velvety and bursting with flavor. The sweet potato/mustard jam and pickled fennel that accompanied the dish were perfect compliments to the savory richness of the paté. Seriously, my boyfriend and I had to close our eyes while consuming this dish--it was just one of those ""oh my god, what is going on in my mouth"" type of moments. 2) Grilled gem lettuce salad: really interesting. The black beans, especially were an interesting choice to go with the creamy garlic dressing, avocado and grana padano, but they worked. I wish there had been more pieces of grilled lettuce in the actual salad (most of the lettuce was not grilled) because that was my favorite flavor in the dish and, considering the name of the dish, I think the grilled lettuce should be the center (rather than merely an accent) of the salad. AND 2) Somen noodles: these were so, so delicious; they were perfectly creamy, yet light at the same time since they were served cold. The combination of ginger, soy, peanut and shiso flavors were fantastic--all subtle on their own but came together in a surprisingly bold way. The hawaiian hearts of palm didn't have much flavor, but added a nice crunch to the smooth noodles.  3) Artichoke soup: we split both the soups, so I had a chance to try both. The artichoke soup was vegan, but you would never know it because it's so creamy. It's a very lemony soup with a nice basil/pesto drizzle. On the menu it says there is horshradish as well, but I couldn't taste any at all. My boyfriend really liked this soup, and although I could appreciate it, it wasn't my favorite--only because I like eating artichokes the way they are and couldn't really get into swallowing them in purée form. AND 3) Salsify Chowder: this was my favorite!! It was like eating clam chowder--only kosher (ha) and so much better! Wow, this soup was just wow... that's about all I can say. Creamy, but not thick at all like most chowders, so it wasn't overwhelming. The toasted hazelnuts within the mix of celery and root vegetables added such an interesting crunch and nutty flavor. You must try it if you dine here! AND 3) With the soups, we also got the bean potstickers (chef's choice to serve them simultaneously): they were really delicious, but looking back, we could have probably done without (just because we were already getting full by this point!) The dough was crispy but not greasy and the inside was filled with a black bean puree, and they were sitting on what was, to me, a white bean hummus and an avocado hummus.  Finally the end of the meal! Our two ""main dishes"" were: 4) Culver Farm Duck Egg: IF YOU EAT HERE, YOU MUST GET THIS. I know I already said that about some other dishes, but seriously, this was insane. The smoked potato purée underneath the toast and duck egg was so damn good. It was like I was eating applewood smoked bacon purée except it was freakin potatoes! AH I don't even have the words to describe this dish. It's just homey and warm and full and playful with all of the different textures and runny yolk. It's a must eat.  AND 4) Country Flatbread: I was less enthused about this one. The actual flatbread was too hard for me to chew and it had the very distant flavor of funnel cake, which made me think that the bread was fried. I liked what was actually on the flatbread (crispy fried onions, sweet potato, cauliflower), but I wouldn't order it again. AND 4) Foraged Maitake Mushrooms: this was mainly for my boyfriend because he's a mushroom fanatic. I'm not such a fan of kimchi, but he reported that these were divine. Finally. Dessert. Only because it was my birthday. Otherwise, I would have totally skipped out because my pants were coming undone (also we had been drinking quite a bit throughout): 5) Peanut Butter Panna Cotta: the waitress recommended it. She brought a candle and also an extra small dessert (blueberry ice cream, which was delicious). Unfortunately, I was pretty underwhelmed by the panna cotta. The peanut butter and chocolate were overly salty! So I had to eat each bite with a huge bite of sweet banana ice cream to balance it out. Fortunately, the dessert didn't taint my impression overall, and I'll definitely be back (for páte, chowder, and duck egg!)",0.9994,0.802,0.173,0.025,0.6006654456654457

We had a reservation, and they seated us promptly.  However, like Joann W, I wasn't  happy with how friendly the service was.   Here's the thing: when you're speaking to someone who doesn't know English, do you start speaking more loudly and more shrilly than you would if you were speaking to a native speaker?  Does that solve anything? What about if you're speaking to people who know perfect English but merely have foreign accents?  This was the case of our visit to Green Zebra.  As we left my parents had to point out that the young Asian man who served our water was the only person who gave us good service.  They were right.  The rest of them spoke to us in these bizarrely loud high pitched voices, over enunciating every word.  Pretty much speaking to us as if we were dogs or something.  I was embarrassed for them.   When I took a look at the menu, I saw that the prices seemed to be lower than our previous visits.  I'm not one to complain about good prices and value, but I've never heard of a restaurant lowering prices.  I had hoped that they had reduced the serving sizes, and not the quality.  However, it was definitely the quality that went down. We got a bunch of things - nine dishes.  So unmemorable.  In our last visit every dish had been impeccably plated and looked beautiful, like tiny pieces of art you didn't want to touch.  But everything now was piled unceremoniously into piles on plates. or bowls. This would have been fine if the food was delicious, but everything was unremarkable and greasy.  I'm not complaining about fat and butter.  I'm complaining about so much greasiness towards the end that you can't really taste a whole lot of anything.  It was bland bland bland, and our plates had coatings of yellow oil.   Toward the end my palate was screaming for a little acid - some lemon juice, lime, whatever - just something to cut the coating of fat that the food left with me.  Even though we had a lot of vegetables, ""fresh"" isn't a word I'd use to describe the way our food tasted.   To boot, it seemed like the staff were rushing to get us out of there, hovering over our table at the end until we just wanted to leave because it was uncomfortable.  We were there for one hour and fifteen minutes total from the moment we walked in the door and walked out.   I don't think that's a unreasonable amount of time for three people to spend relaxing and having dinner and drinking wine.   The only redeeming factor was the check - it was quite lower than I expected and was willing to pay. But I would have been much happier paying more for a better experience.    It just didn't feel high end.   What a disappointing drop, Green Zebra.",0.9912,0.809,0.13,0.061,0.5025921442023135

The main disappointment was the service.  We were greeted by the server who immediately gave off a disinterested and dismissive vibe.  After taking our order, we didn't see her again until we were on the third dish, as she asked how our meal was as she ran by the table.   The food runners and bussers were much more willing to help.  I hope they got a good percentage of her tip because they were the ones that deserved it.",0.9797,0.764,0.213,0.023,0.4971111111111111

2015-02-27,3.0,"Concluded my 2015 Chicago Restaurant Week adventure with another 2015 Michelin Bib Gourmand restaurant!  For $33 per person, we were graced with a four-course dinner menu. My favorite was the first course, roasted red beets with whipped sumac yogurt, honeycomb crushed pistachios, lemon rosewater. There was a very good and fresh balance of sour and sweets especially with the arugula garnish. Second course was the carrot ginger bisque which did not have a very strong ginger flavor as I had previously worried about. instead, it was generous with sliced Fuji apples, parsnip cream, and curry-shallot cream. Flavors were pretty light but it is very warming for the cold weather. Third course was the potato gnocchi served with grilled eggplant and braised kale in olive oil. The contents were very absorbent of the oil so each bite seemed to leave behind a lip full of grease. Last but not least, dessert was sweet mango sticky rice with banana tapioca tuile and cocoa nibs. Presentation was beautiful and I particularly appreciated the cocoa nibs. But the name is a misnomer. The mango flavors were extremely sour and the sticky rice did not have any adhesiveness as it should.  Reservations are highly recommended as space is tight. The environment is very comfortable and modern with a sleek touch of wood, glass, and bamboo plants. We came on a packed night and it was not speak easy.

I was glad it was restaurant week because we were able to order several dishes off the special menu. Here is what we tried. First/ Second Courses * Roasted Red Beets - Even though this dish sounded delicious - I wasn't too delighted with final product. * Israeli cous cous salad - This dish was just perfect! I loved the combination of cashew cream, carrots and raisin with cous cous and quinoa. We just could not get enough of this dish  * Carrot Ginger Bisque - I found the soup to be good but more bland than I would have liked. I wish it had a bit more flavor to be honest to take it up a notch. A girl can always wish! :) * Adzuki bean potstickers - This was just okay. Almost felt like Spring rolls to me. I had a bite and didn't feel compelled to eat rest of those fatty calories.  Entrees Our Entrees were Marinated tofu with rice and Potato Gnocchi and unfortunately, I didn't love them as much as I loved my first two courses. I wished I had tried the pot pie - Hopefully next time. Finally moving on to desserts - We got Brownie Sundae and Mango sticky rice. My husband loved the sticky rice and I will admit that it was good but Brownie Sundae - especially black sesame ice-cream was just too good. I loved every bite of it and it was so worth the 1000+ calories it probably had :) Overall, I loved the most of the dishes and the dessert even though we didn't love our entrees. But I will admit that service here is top notch. Our dishes were promptly removed and water was refilled before we realized we needed more.

However, a special shout-out to the service; others had so-so experiences with the staff here when it came to bringing kids into the establishment but that was not our experience.  We came in at 5:30, were seated away from other guests when the space was empty, and a manager brought over a small sample of vegan pretzels for our one-year-old to try while we dined.  And we still love the space even if the meal didn't deliver.  (My current four-star rating is a reflection of our first visit, a five-star, and the visit this past week, a three star.)",0.9408,0.9,0.08,0.02,0.38062358276643987

It can be seen as a bit pretentious but the food delivers so that is ok by me. The pumpkin soup was creamy and well balanced. The apples in it seemed to be quite random until you take a bite with all the parts and it just pops. The mushroom pate was earthy and delicious balanced by the sweet potato mustardo and pickled fennel. I mean who pickles fennel? The polenta seemed a bit simplistic at first but the char on the veggies really set it off. The risotto was cooked perfectly with a creamy goodness and perfect level of salt. Then there was the desert. A peanut butter panna cota. All I can say is WOW.  The service was above average. I never had to hunt down my server and several times the manager even came by to check on us. The waitstaff was knowledgeable about the ingredients and were in general helpful with ordering.

2014-07-20,4.0,"*update - see my original review below* I'm taking off a star because of the hot, steamy, sauna-like atmosphere.  I would eat here every day, if they would update their air conditioning system to accommodate the restaurant's cooling needs.   In a previous review, I bitched about being so uncomfortable with the high temperature of the restaurant that it detracted from my excellent meal.  Two years later and nothing has improved.  It's still like the tropics in there. The service here is lackluster and unfriendly.  The staff is aloof, hurried, and just plain lame.  ALWAYS!  The management and ownership obviously perpetuates this climate, because I've dined here for many years, read many complaints about it, and nothing ever changes. The food is sublime.  We always do the chef's tasting menu.  The dishes were all a feast for the eyes and delicious.  The gazpacho was a stand out.  GZ always nails the soup right on the head.  I could have done without the so spicy it hurt twist to our dessert, but I'm sure some people enjoy pain. We got a dirty spoon, but I guess that can happen.  No big whoop.  The waitress quickly replaced it. Once again, the bartender missed the mark.  They need to hire a better mixologist.  The investment is worth it.  Selling many more drinks really boosts profits. If you can overlook the service and comfort, you'll be fine. The restaurant is always packed, so they couldn't care less that everyone is sweating like a hog. Please, Green Zebra, invest in an air con tweak, so I can dine with you daily.",0.8937,0.755,0.139,0.106,0.49660997732426304

My wife is vegan and this is a very highly rated vegetarian restaurant. And I should add tapas style, small plates.  Well, the food was good, but the waitress told us that the vegetarian dishes wouldn't be good if they're made vegan. Really? Seriously? You're a vegetarian restaurant and you don't want to accommodate a vegan? And on her birthday? We made a bunch of choices and liked everything. The cold noodles were great, the flatbread was really good, the hash was good. But something wasn't right. You know the difference between being really satisfied by good food and having an hors d'oeuvre somewhere or a tasting and liking it? That's kind of how it was here. The food was good, but not satisfying. I don't know how else to describe it.  The atmosphere wasn't fun. Definitely not great for a birthday. And the desserts were okay. They did remember her birthday, so there's that. Nothing was bad here, but I would just call it all okay.

2014-07-05,5.0,"My husband and I decided on Green Zebra for our anniversary dinner after hearing about their independence day BBQ fixed menu, which sounded amazing! I made our reservation, and noted that it was our wedding anniversary. We arrived about 15 minutes early, and the place was packed with happy diners. We understandably had to wait a bit for our table to open up, and so we did. As we waited, a lovely woman (manager? owner?) came up and asked if it was we who were having the anniversary. Thinking our table was ready, I said yes enthusiastically. ""Follow me"" she said, as she walked out the door of the restaurant. Confused, but intrigued, we did as she asked. Once on the sidewalk, she informed us that she wanted to buy us something ""sparkling"" for our anniversary, and brought us over to Unite, where we received some complimentary champagne to sip while we waited for our table at Green Zebra. What a treat! As we finished our bubbly, the lovely women returned to let us know the table was ready, so we headed over. We chose to order the accompanying wine pairings to go with our dinner - we chose the vegan options from each course, and DAMN was it good! I can't even recall all of what was served, but it was four courses of awesome, including an insane BBQ mushroom burger with onion rings. Every bite was delicious, and the wine pairings perfectly suited to each course. At the end of our meal, as we were finishing the amazing fruit tart dessert, the lovely woman returned, informing us that she was about to leave for the evening, but wanted to wish us a happy anniversary one last time. She capped off our already perfect dinner with an ADDITIONAL complimentary glass of sparking wine, which was wonderfully sweet. In addition, they had a special anniversary greeting printed on the menu for the evening, so she sent us home with a copy of the menu! I was floored by the wonderful service and extra attention to our special night, and can't stop thinking about how awesome it was.

2014-06-25,3.0,"Hmm. Pretentious vegetarian restaurants aren't my thing. At first, I was really excited about coming here for a friend's birthday. I had heard about Green Zebra for awhile and all I knew was that it was some kind of vegetarian restaurant with locally sourced food and a rotating menu. Sounds good to me. Once our group was seated in the swanky dining room (with so many tables arranged so couples had to sit really close together -- I almost felt like we were intruding upon their privacy), we were handed menus and given a run-down of how things worked.  Green Zebra's menu is all small plates, intended to be shared with whomever you're dining with. Eek. We hadn't expected that. The menu is incredibly pricey to start off with, so knowing that the portions were really small didn't help. After discussing the menu for awhile, our group finally placed our orders and waited for the food to arrive. I started off my meal with an orange and fennel creme soda. It sounded amazing but was incredibly small for the price and tasted.... meh. Not a great start. Onwards... our meal was pretty much a six-course meal, starting with the smallest of the small dishes and ending with the heavier, filling plates. The dishes were brought out slowly, stretching our meal to a nearly four-hour long dining experience. Eek, again. From that night, I tried: + Pumpernickel bread with housemade garlic-thyme butter and carrot marmalade. + Acorn Squash Potstickers with soy caramel, carrot sesame purée, shaved radish + Fresh Stinging Nettle Fettuccine, fava beans, Bordeaux spinach, Parmigiano Reggiano + Country Flatbread, heirloom tomato jam, warm herbed goat cheese, Cerignola olives  + Artisan Cheese Selection (chef's daily selection of assorted cheeses) + Malted Banana Ice Cream with banana bread, salted caramel, macadamia nut tuile + some kind of veggie mushroom hash with egg +... and something with brussels sprouts. +.... there was another dish too, but I forgot what it was. Everything was.... delicious. I was quite pleased with nearly every dish I tried. Yay! Yet... they were small. For some of the plates, we had to order more than one so we could have enough to share at our table of six. To top it off, we were still hungry at the end of the meal. It added up and our bill was kind of ridiculous. A long meal with expensive dishes that still left us hungry at the end? Not cool. We were all mildly disappointed with our experience.

It does rhyme.  Lastly but not leastly, we did get dessert; the deconstructed 'Carrot Cake' (they put the quotes, not me).  It was good.  The cake part itself was crazy dry, but when paired with the spiced carrot ice cream and the brûléed cream cheese...I finished it.  I'd definitley go back as there is more I want to try.",0.992,0.737,0.19,0.074,0.6099014778325123

The egg with avocado sandwich was soggy, and the grits and the side of french fries with the house mayo were just okay, but underseasoned.  The staff could have been a little friendlier; I did like the space of the restaurant as it was nice and bright.  I am glad I was able to try this place out. +underseasoned/overseasoned food T___T +less-than-friendly staff",0.9595,0.848,0.126,0.026,0.5477430555555556
2014-02-13,5.0,"Some of the best food I've had in Chicago. Servings are small for the price. But everything is made with quality ingredients so a few bites of each small plate is all it takes. Service was excellent. Only complaints - I think the wine is priced higher than need be. Also we ordered a dessert of gourmet cookies and a duo of hot chocolate. One was a delicious blueberry-infused hot chocolate and the other a Mexican coffee-infused hot chocolate. And that's my complaint. I do not like coffee and my lady friend didn't really want to have the coffee that late in the evening, although she did drink it. Any time a chocolate dish has coffee in it that should clearly be told to the patron in advance (like on the menu). I hate the surprise of ordering chocolate and finding coffee in it.",0.8574,0.795,0.127,0.079,0.5504629629629629
2014-02-07,5.0,Probably my favorite vegetarian/vegan restaurant in Chicago. Their menu changes up and offers unique food and drink. Things are a little slow until around 8 and then everyone rushes in to the place. As for reccommendations I would say the mushroom pate without hesitation. Hats off to the chefs that prepare whatever magic goes into that. I ended up doing the 5 course chef's taste meal last time I was here and each dish was full of flavor. You really can't go wrong here with whatever you decide to get.,0.7671,0.914,0.086,0.0,0.6018518518518519
2014-02-06,5.0,"I have blogged Green Zebra on Chicago Alphabet Soup. Quite surprised that I had not put a brief review here on Yelp. However, I returned for Chicago Restaurant Week and was still pleasantly surprised that they know how to make being vegetarian a sexy thing. I started with a beet salad. My grandmother is looking down on me now saying, ""Oh, so now you decided that you like beets."" The creamed fennel soup puts creamed soups to shame. And the halloumi over sweet potatoes and mushrooms blew my mind. In the past, I have gone for their Sunday brunch offerings. And I had gone a few other times for dinner. Not once did I ever leave unsatisfied. The disappointment in my most recent visit came with discovering that they no longer have brunches. According to the server, the brunch crowd thinned out during football season and during the summer. That would be the whole year and the dining room was ALWAYS packed whenever I went, football season and summer notwithstanding. Anyway, there is always after 5:00. If you want a good introduction into vegetarian dining without a fear of being served rabbit food only, I recommend Green Zebra highly.

2014-02-06,2.0,"Maaan, this place used to be my favorite! An fancy-pants vegetarian gem with the most delectable small plates, even by my carnivorous partner's standards, and service befitting a world-class restaurant. I picked this restaurant for many a special occasion. Over the years though, I finally had to admit things were sliding downhill. This became really apparent when we visited for my birthday last fall. The food was mediocre and the service was the poorest it had ever been -- our server was super rushed and brusque in his interactions with us. (Also, I couldn't help notice the absence some of the little things that aren't important at all, but had always made this place feel so magical - refreshed silverware for each course, tiny slices of gourmet bread, complimentary dessert or drinks for celebrations, even the fancy cloth-like paper towels in the bathroom. I don't know if it's a conscious decision to become more casual or an economic need to pare down, but it just kind of felt like something beautiful had died. Too dramatic, I know :).) As for the food, I ordered the tamale dish, intrigued by the mix of chanterelle mushrooms with blueberries. It was very bland, with only small bits of chanterelle, and the sadly tart blueberries detracted from the dish. I was annoyed about spending $13 on this when one can find an insanely great $2 portobello tamale in the burbs :P.  I also ordered the fettuccine, which, despite the various veggies and ricotta, had a similarly disappointing flavor. It was tossed in a brown butter sauce that seemed just a little too burnt. We'd already felt a bit jilted during a previous visit -- we'd brought our membership card on which we'd finally spent the requisite $250(?) to receive a $25 reward, only to find that they discontinued the program. With the experience we received this visit, we probably won't be back for a good while.",0.9626,0.822,0.116,0.062,0.6135124135124135
2014-02-04,4.0,"Made reservations here for restaurant week a few weeks in advance, but when we arrived we had to wait 30 minutes for our table!?!  Who knew a Monday night would be so crowded?   Anyway, while we were waiting, one of the hosts mistakenly brought my friend and I two glasses of Chianti.  I figured that they were feeling badly about having us stand there and wait for our table so long, but apparently it was an ordering mix-up and he promptly took the glasses away from us when he realized that we were not the ones who ordered the vino.  A bit embarrassing for him, but he was super nice about bringing our whole group (4 of us) glasses of Prosecco to make up for the embarrassment.   Finally, we were seated and placed orders for our food and drink.  Service was ok, not super attentive, but just alright.  Food was pretty tasty, you can tell that they put a lot of effort into making dishes that are normally made with meat or meat stock (risotto, dumplings, etc), just as delicious and fulfilling without actually including the meat.  My appetizer, the beet salad, had this delicious whipped cream-like stuff on the top which paired wonderfully with the tart freshness of the beets and bitterness of the greens.  Next, the acorn squash dumplings was great, savory, and perfectly seasoned.  Crispy on the outside and tender and delicious on the inside, drizzled with a tangy soy caramel on the very top.  My entree, the barley risotto, was also wonderful.  The layers of flavor were wonderful, definitely a dish I'd order again.  Desserts, a few of us ordered the white chocolate mousse and I ordered the coconut cake, were really yummy.  The white chocolate mousse was creamy and included fresh, delicious blueberries.  I do think that my dish of coconut cake was better; perfectly matched with fresh and sweet ginger sauce and a wonderfully refreshing lemongrass ice cream - LOVED IT!   We had a really good dining experience, and although the service was just average (and at times weird with the wine mix-up and the other hostess girl asking us 10 times if we'd like to check our coats) it's nice to have a high-end vegetarian place to go to in the city.  It's also great that many of the menu items can be made vegan, if requested.  We really appreciate little restaurant gems like these and I guarantee that anyone you bring to this joint won't miss the meat for a second!",0.9993,0.673,0.284,0.043,0.585204081632653
2014-02-03,5.0,I don't think this place needs another rave review about the food they serve here!! Its almost unbelievable that a French Chef can come up with a vegetarian restaurant and make it such a success. It is difficult to impress me with veg food but the food here was to die for.  We went here for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. He ordered a la carte while I tried the 5-course menu. This I think was a great idea else the food would have been too much for us. I am not saying that they serve big portions but a 5 course meal can be more than filling for one person.  The service and ambiance were good but the food was great!!

2014-01-27,3.0,"I heard about Green Zebra the first week I moved to Chicago - ten years later, managed to finally make it out here with carnivore friends for restaurant week! The promise of a 4 course dinner, had most of us going in hungry and excited - the quality of the food was impeccable, the quantity left much to be desired. The special menu featured a couple or so choices across the courses. We started with a beet salad - or rather, a smidgen of salad - the portion was so small! We waited with bated breath for the next course -- 4 small Acorn Squash Dumplings - taste buds gratified, tummy was hankering for more.. Next out - Pearled Barley 'Risotto' - a few spoons of it - by this time we were kind of making second dinner plans! Finally a small coconut cake, with a dollop of ice-cream - dry but at least it was more than a bite!

I had brunch here a few years ago and remembered enjoying my vegan experience but DAMN, did I fall in love when I was in town last week. My dear friend made reservations for us on Saturday evening and from start to finish, everything was on point.  We were even running around 15 minute behind on our reservations but received nothing but kindness when we called to give a heads up. Our hostess was super friendly when we arrived and we were ushered to our seats immediately although the dining room was pretty packed.  We decided to order several plates to share and boy, was I glad that we did. I especially appreciated the clear menu that denoted what dishes could be tweaked to become vegan.  The Chickpea Salad ($10) was a great way to kick things off  with curry roasted cauliflower, marinated peppers, and golden raisins. Next up was the Housemade Coconut Curry that bursted with flavor! We split this ($12) and had more than enough to satisfy our tastebuds.  Add in the Acorn Squash Dumplings that included a delightful soy caramel and carrot sesame purée at $12, comforting Pearled Barley 'Risotto1($13), and the Beaver Dam Pepper Hash ($12) and you can literally flip even the most resistant carnivore to admit that the veg-life isn't so shabby! I refrained from wine due to a stomach ache but my friend couldn't stop chatting about how tasty the wine selection was. I was itching to try dessert as well, but alas, my stomach simply didn't have the room to indulge any more! We were stuffed.

I admit I should have maybe predicted this, as I learned shortly before we went in to the restaurant that it was the same guy who did Spring, which is now closed. I felt exactly the same way about this place as I felt about Spring after eating there -- food was good but  not memorable overall (and the dessert was actually flat out disgusting, which we really were not expecting), there is no real consistent theme going on with the menu (or at least not one I could find), the service was not bad, but it was not particularly good, the atmosphere seems dingy for the price of the food -- like they converted the restaurant from a bar or some other retail space but didn't quite do that great of a job of it. I know these all seem like overly picky complaints, but when you are paying around $150 for a meal for two people, you expect a certain level of atmosphere and service which both my husband and I really felt this did not provide. The food is good, but it is not really special for the price, and along with the other negatives, we would think twice before coming back here.",0.9571,0.803,0.136,0.061,0.4213054187192118

Very bland and unappealing.   -polenta and fettucine dishes-both were the heaviest dishes of the evening.  Tasty and quite filling. The service was great and the restaurant will do a pasta with butter and cheese for little ones.  They said they'd add veggies to the pasta ""if they had them"" and surprisingly for a VEGETARIAN restaurant, they apparently did not have any to spare since our son's pasta was just butter and cheese.  None-the-less, he enjoyed the dish and they only charged $5.

I wasn't sure what time we would arrive there since my friend had some things to take care of that evening so I made reservations for 8pm.  We arrived at 7:15pm and they were able to accommodate us immediately even thought the restaurant was packed.  I really appreciated that.  I have been in similar situations at other restaurants and they look at you like you are an alien for even asking if there is possibly an earlier table to be had.  They were just really nice and accommodating. Now for the fun part:  THE FOOD!  All of the food on the menu is vegetarian ad anything with a V can be made to be Vegan.  Our server was great about telling us what would be altered to make it Vegan.  Most of the time just omitting the Cheese was all it took.  My friend is not Vegan so they were happy to put the Cheese the side for her so she didn't miss out. We shared seven small plates in all..the ones I really liked were: Beets with some sort of seeds, similar to sunflower seeds.  That was delicious! Chick Peas, strange that the description says with Baba Ghanoush.  It was more like a SMEAR of Baba Ghanoush, not enough to really even eat...but the Chick Peas were good on their own. Mission Figs with Radicchio.  The Radicchio was bitter but the fig balanced it nicely. Dumplings with a Chinese mustard and cabbage.  This was my favorite!! Dishes that were just OK were: Corn tamales.....had a strange after taste Green Beans with Sesame seeds....just OK to me. I also had a peanut butter mousse dessert that was to die for.  Not cheap, $170.00 including tip for two....we each had a couple of drinks....

After ordering our food we were brought a shooter of gazpacho.  We love spicy food but the heat in this soup was unbearable.  We ended up ordering 11 dishes for three people and can honestly say that only three were edible (lentils, dumplings, and polenta) and certainly not great.

I booked a reservation, and we dressed up nicely and grabbed an I-Go car to head across town. Arriving, there was no host(ess) at the front, and we stood around confused in a narrow and noisy entryway for several minutes.

For five or ten minutes further, there was no service, though we got glasses of water from the water guy toward the end of this window. Then a waitress showed up and *unseated* us to move us because that table was needed by a larger party. Whaaaat? You call this ""fine dining?"" After being reseated at our new table and several more minutes of no service, I convinced my mom to walk out with me before we consumed anything billable. So in our approximately half-hour dining experience, for which we had reservations, she and I unfolded a couple napkins and got glasses of complimentary water by probably the lowest-paid employee at the place.

Polenta Cake: a bit firmer than your usual polenta, and a bit richer tasting (other things in it?)  Reminded me of Chinese turnip cake in texture.  Topped with blue cheese and other tastiness Golden Curry: a nice presentation, filled with spaghetti squash or something like it.  A great flavor. ""Risotto""- made with barley, perhaps?  I loved the texture and crunch of the grains contrasting with the creamy sauce LIKED: Poached egg on potato puree.  The egg was very dense, almost chewy and deeply flavorful with the yolk.  The potato puree was just mashed potatoes. Sesame noodles: TONS of Chinese mustard.  First bite = ick, then you keep eating and it gets addictive.   Focaccia: served with an olive tapenade and tomato jam.  The tapenade was great.

2013-04-28,1.0,"My first review on Yelp is an indicator of how motivated to review the restaurant I am! Each of my husband's and my two courses were served room temperature at best.  I had to ask that the soup be rewarmed.  I should have thought that might be a ""heads up"" to insure the next course was hot, but not. The food was well seasoned and otherwise tasty...but...my entree was completely dried out.  When the meal was over and the server asked how we found our meal, I said I would like to give someone feedback.. A woman showed up but did not identify herself nor her job. I explained that the food was cold, that my meal was dried out, etc.  she said there should have been more sauce on what I ordered.  THAT WAS IT! The bill was not modified, we were not offered a replacement for the dried out dish.  We were nit offered a complimentary glass of wine, dessert or cup of coffee.  Nothing! The food was expensive considering the tiny portions.  The main courses were barely appetizer sized Poor value and the worst customer service I have experienced.",0.7858,0.861,0.092,0.047,0.537037037037037
2013-04-25,1.0,"Wow, I'm really surprise how great of a reviews this place has gotten and from so many people.  Usually Yelp is my go to place for reviews/suggestions (and one of the reasons we choose this place to eat).  However, I (along with my party) was highly disappointed.  First I'll start off with the good since there are not that many:  Great location, easily accessible (but then again it's Chicago, which most places are).  Great atmosphere!  Nice to come after work and just relax.  Cozy spot, friendly staff as soon as we walked in, reservations were easy.  Great food presentation (unfortunately I don't go to eat just so my food can look good on the plate). I think that's about it.  Let me first start off by saying I am a vegetarian, I went there with 3 other friends, also vegetarian so we were excited to go somewhere especially catered to us in a world of carnivores.  As soon as we got there we were greeted and once again the hostess was very friendly.  Our waitress comes over and ask if we've ever been there and we explain no, so she goes over the tasting menus versus the a la carte (well she didn't go over it she explained the difference) says if we have any questions let her know.  Well we had plenty of questions but too bad she didn't come back to our table until about 15 minutes later.  So being novice we ask what she would suggest.  Her answer? ""Everything!"" ok, well that's not hopeful.  So we ask what a few things are (because for whatever reason they need to sound like food for carnivores so they name them meat titles) and we ask 'oh duck egg, how does that taste?' her response? Delicious! umm ok, 'how about the oyster mushroom soup, how is that?' once again, her response? 'Delicious!'.  I'm not sure about anyone else but usually when I go to a restaurant I expect to get some direction from the server but from all of our questions the same answer so we just figured something out when she left again for another 15 minutes prior to taking our order.  We all decided to get a few appetizers to split and each get two to three different courses so we could try a bit of everything from everyone.   The only good thing about the meal were the appetizers (cheese)  and the wine.  I won't go into full details about everyones plate however a general overview is not good enough to spend the money they want.  The food was bland and when it did have some flavor the food either tasted like dill or vinegar, although these may be great flavors its not meant for everything.  I would expect this kind of food at a McDonald's, from people that do not understand that vegetarians have tastebuds too and just throw something together, not from somewhere that is catering to them.  Not only did we have bad food but the waitress was literally never around, we probably weighted a good 30 mins after the last person finished the course before we got the next.  Although the place was busy we never once saw the waitress running around (we were seated next to the bar, we hardly saw her walk past us from the kitchen).  Maybe it was just a one time experience, however, I will not be returning to Green Zebra nor would I EVER recommend anyone to go there.  I would suggest so many other vegetarian restaurants in Chicago (sadly enough even non-vegetarian restaurants, if you speak with the chef directly about your dietary needs you'll probably get a better meal than you can ever get here).",0.9904,0.846,0.111,0.043,0.5255982905982908

2013-03-21,4.0,"Definitely an interesting experience. Not sure I'd want to go back, but interesting nonetheless. Luckily, my company for the evening is a food fan like myself, so we were not short on evaluations of each course. And it couldn't have been more fun.  For starters, the ambience is unusual and ideal. Very serence and, yet, slightly obscure. My particular favorite design element was the bottom of the stair case protruding from the space next door and the seating arrangements complementing that. I didn't, however, enjoy the claustrophobic bathroom stall (but enough potty talk). One to the food! For this particular review, I would like to work backwards since my absolute favorite course was the dessert. More specifically, the banana split dessert. Shawn McClain, I love you. I want to marry you and get fat from your orgasmic desserts. I've even convert to vegetarianism for you. (If you know me, you'd know how much that means. Glazed bananas and SALTED caramel ice cream? Yes, please! I'd like to add that I also had the Blondie (my guest and I got one of everything on the Chef's Week menu and split it...I'm not a pig that eats for two...though that's not to say that I couldn't...or haven't...I'm stopping). The Blondie was delightful, most notably the poppy ice cream. For THAT, I would go back for seconds. Oh, and the blackberry? Fogettaboutit! Moving one to the third course; both were a miss for me and here's why: A) The Risotto course, though tasty in flavor, was not fully cooked. It's a little hard to overlook that. B) The Polenta course was interesting in flavor, but greatly lacked a crunchy component. There was just too much mush and not enough crunch. It was all one baby food texture. Course number two will be paused to make room for the KIMCHI we ordered. I mean, how could we not try the WINNER of the KIMCHI CHALLENGE from the Good Food Festival just days prior. I'm gonna say, yes. Yes. And YES. Good Laaawwd! With Kimchi like this, who needs meat?!? Wait, I do. I'm only kidding. It's good but I'd still prefer a good steak over mushroom kimchi, sorry, it's not personal; it's a carnivore thing. Now course two: the Fall Root Dumplings Again I have a critique. The dough was overly salty and since it's the first thing to touch your taste buds when biting in, it's hard not to notice. The Root veggies on the other hand, were the opposite--they were bland. I would have added some spice to the filling. I will commend the chef on fully cooking the filling. Root veggies are often times left to hard, making them appear raw. And now the first course... A) Eggplant Bruschetta. YUUUMMMMMYYY. My only comment (because it wouldn't be right to just enjoy) would be that the balance of eggplant to bread was off. There was too much eggplant topping on each one. Good though. DAMN good. B) Salad. Excellent dressing, but after having written about the other courses, I can hardly remember it. So it couldn't have been much more than a good salad.  Oh, the meal opener was christened by a complimentary shot of a raspberry juice thing. Amazing. Tasted like spicet think compote. Loved it. One more thing, the root beer? Not good.  So, do I recommend this ""Green Zebra""? I do. Go, try it. Veg out. Have some fun, veggie-style. And ladies with space issues, save the bathroom trip for your next destination. PLEASE NOTE: The four star rating is for the kimchi and (banana split) dessert. Otherwise, I'd say three.",0.9994,0.725,0.242,0.033,0.5191123235137319

Everything tasted good, but I felt like I was served a series of appetizers. There was no progression, certainly no climax to the tasting. There was supposed to be, but I found the mushroom course, which featured a single solitary mushroom cap, to be anticlimactic. This was my first time doing vegetarian. I was anxious to try vegetarian because I wanted to see a chef stand up to the challenge of cooking up amazing flavors without meat. I don't think I'll ever go to this kind of restaurant again unless it's Indian where you have bold flavors and plenty of heat.

I've had Mana in Wicker Park before and was completely unimpressed with their tapas and we wanted to stray from our typical tapas bar, Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba.  That being said, we both wanted to try something new and ended up at the Green Zebra.   Needless to say by this 5-star review, we were left completely satiated.  The service was great, but the food was even better.  I had some squash gnocchi which was a special on the menu and I have been dreaming of it for a month straight.  It's not every day that a vegetarian eats food from a smoker!  They smoked their gnocchi to porn-like perfection.  We also enjoyed the flatbread and a few other delectable dishes leading us to the orgasmic experience... DESSERT.  While neither of us saved any room for dessert, we totally forced fed ourselves into a food coma.  I would recommend the Zebra to meat eaters or vegetarians alike.",0.9849,0.77,0.172,0.058,0.41546753246753243

I held off on reviewing it because I wanted to fall in love with GZ so bad! I am going to focus on my most recent experience for this review.  My date and I went to celebrate my birthday so naturally we had been dreaming about indulging ourselves till immobile all day! We were seated immediately after checking in for our reservation even though we were 5 minutes late (""on time"" for me is 5 minute late Period)!  My date had never been to GZ so our server explained that the menu was listed as smaller/ lighter dishes at the top and heavier/ larger dishes at the bottom. She also recommended that we could each do 2 dishes since we each wanted dessert.  I ordered the Chilled Somen Noodles and the Crimson Lentil Croquettes for dinner knowing I wanted the Mousse for dessert. I must say that I did not enjoy either of my dishes at all. The noodles were very bland lacking the Asian splash I was expecting and the Croquettes were just GROSS! And I mean gross in the sense they they were in the deep fryer waaaaaaayyyy too long because I had to really work with my knife to cut through the hard shell and they were EXTREMELY DRY! I mean, the kind of dry where I drank a whole glass of water to moisten my pallet and almost asked for ketchup! VERY disappointing! My date ordered the Smoked Salsify Risotto and the Eggplant & Tofu Dumplings. He liked the risotto but the portion size was much smaller than expected. The same negative comment went for the dumplings... except we both thought they were boring as well. Both dishes left him still empty so he added an order of the Savory Pumpkin Crepe. This was the best dish of the night in both of our opinions (of course we had to try each others dishes... duh)! And the portion size was the largest of all our dishes... I don't get it (it was in the middle of the menu)! At last we were ready for dessert where we were finally not disappointed in flavor. My mousse was very rich with caramel drizzlings to keep is fresh while the pumpkin cake was lighter and perfectly expressing Fall. The final frustration of the evening however was that the waitress forgot it was my birthday and instead of simply comping one of our desserts she had the kitchen bring out a third dessert of woopie pies with a candle.

Overall, I would NOT recommend this restaurant.  Our server treated us like we weren't worthy of his time because we didn't rack up a $400 meal, he (seemingly) avoided us when the order was wrong, and he gave us a little too much 'tude.

2012-10-26,3.0,"Maybe this place is better vegetarian than it was semi-vegan.  Wanted to love this place, but only thought it was ok.  We got everything on the menu that could be made non-dairy, which meant all their vegan options plus the sesame noodles which have egg in them and shared them  All of it was fine, but nothing was phenomenal in terms of taste.  Also, portions were quite small for the price and for the favoring.   Here's what we got: Whole Grain Michê, herbed butter, summer giardinara - interesting spiced flavoring in the giardinara , and since I didn't eat the herbed butter maybe I didn't like it because the bread with the giardinara was not amazing.  My friends who ate the bread with the butter enjoyed it.  Roasted Baby Beets & Raspberry Salad, savory chocolate, spiced pecans, tarragon - This was not bad, but I didn't pick up on the chocolate taste, which, I imagine, is the interesting part of this dish.  Grilled Werp Farm Baby Lettuce, 'perfect' farm egg, crispy potato tot, sherry vinaigrette - I think this was my favorite because the warm poached egg with the lettuce and the tots all came together nicely.  We liked the tots so much we asked them to be made into a side, which they generously did for $5.  Smoked Salsify Risotto, grilled treviso, orange supreme, fresh dill - This was not bad, but it seemed a little liquidy and I did not pick up any particularly interesting flavor.  Sort of reminiscent of congee.  Crimson Lentil Croquettes, mango chutney, scallion, mint, cilantro - This was tasty, it had complex flavoring and the outside of the croquettes were crispy and the inside soft.  Chutney was also good.  Eggplant & Tofu Dumplings, sweet chili sauce, poblano pepper, Savoy cabbage - Wanted to love these, but even after eating two of them, they just didn't do anything for me beyond a typical pan-fried veggie dumpling with some spicy sauce from anywhere else.  Toasted Sesame Noodles, housemade kimchi, braised lotus root, Chinese mustard - Wanted to love this too, but it was shockingly bland.  I kept waiting for the mustard or kimchi to really pop out, but it didn't.  Also the lotus root was pretty soft and I'm used to eating them crispy.    Brussels spouts on the side - these were excellent, tender and with a little salt and garlic, but nothing beyond what I could have made at home.  Vegan dessert was chef's bites of chocolate cupcake, creamy apply/peary sorbet, and an lemon italian ice.  Since we got the lemon italian ice for a ""compliments from the chef"" at the beginning of the meal, it was annoying that 1/3 of my dessert was the same thing.  The vegan chocolate cupcake was ok - the cake was a little dried out and the mousse on top was a little too tangy (like too much tofu/lemon juice and not that chocolate-y).  The sorbet was great, super creamy and full of fruit apply/pear flavoring.  It sort of tasted like apple cider in sorbet form.  Service was very attentive and nice.  I admittedly had high expectations for this place and unfortunately it just didn't really meet them.  The price/portion/flavoring ratio was just too skewed to pricey without decent portions or interesting flavoring on most of the dishes.",0.9986,0.768,0.195,0.037,0.5553389830508475

I have enjoyed taking new friends and out of towners to showcase chicago's culinary range. Have always favored green zebra's understated panache and off beat neighborhood location.

2012-09-18,4.0,"On my first trip to Chicago with Zach a couple of years ago, he suggested we go to Green Zebra, but at the time, there were few, if any, vegan options. Fast forward to today and you'll see that they are very vegan-friendly. I had always heard good things about this restaurant and was anxious to check it out. Green Zebra was opened by Chef Shawn McClain in 2004, but at the time it was not a vegetarian restaurant though I also believe it wasn't a very meat-heavy restaurant either. About a year and a half ago, it became 100% vegetarian and is now also vegan-friendly. I convinced a friend of mine who isn't vegetarian to go with me to get his thoughts on the cuisine so we headed out in search of the Green Zebra. In the dark, the restaurant is hard to find as there is no visible sign from the street. Once close though, I did see their logo on the window. We almost missed it entirely! Luckily, at least their address is clearly posted. When you first enter, you walk up this ramp to the main dining area. The restaurant is pretty small, but well organized and there is a small bar at the front, which is pretty much in the dining area. For such a small space, I think they did a great job maximizing the space. On the walls, there is this unique artwork by Ashley L. Lieber that is made of live moss. They are all from the same artist and are all for sale. You just have to spray each one often to keep it alive. Interesting. We sat close to the bar and began looking at the wine menu. We chose a bottle of Givry 1er Cru, Le Petit Pretan, Besson, Burgundy, France for $62. This was a very light wine, in fact, a bit too light for my liking, but it was fine. We both decided to go with the 5-course tasting menu. I went with the vegan version while my friend went with the only other option -- vegetarian.  We were both served an amuse bouche of Moroccan spiced popcorn to start, which we enjoyed. My first course was a salad off the menu made of arugula, cooked cauliflower, pumpernickel croutons and a citrus dressing. It was very unique and had some great flavors. The second course was a black bean pozole that had black beans, corn, shaved radish, and cilantro. This soup was spectacular. I don't think I've ever had yellow heirloom hominy corn, but it was harder than your typical corn and was perfect for this dish. The shaved, crinkled radish went well as well. Superb! The third course was my favorite -- the crispy sweet potato dumplings. These were dumplings were filled with sweet potatoes and deep fried served with honeycrisp apple sticks, walnut-sage pistou, and crabapple ketchup. Delicious! The fourth course was warm soba noodles with crispy turnips along with a cashew cream. It was okay, but paled in comparison to the other dishes. For dessert, I was served a rice pudding with some sort of shaved ice on top. It tasted like sour lemon shavings. I didn't particularly like the dessert.  I'm really glad I was engaging in interesting conversation with someone, otherwise, I think this review would have been worse as the service was not very attentive. I was too engaged to be completely annoyed, but there were two things in particular that I didn't like -- one was that we had to pour our own wine because we rarely saw the server and the other was that the server barely said anything about the dishes. Most of my dishes were off menu or completely modified to be made vegan and he didn't even take the time to tell me about them. Besides that though, I did have a good experience there. My friend liked all of his dishes and I enjoyed most of mine. So although the service is lacking, the food is pretty good. At $55 for the tasting menu, I think it was priced appropriately.

Of these, the Lentil Croquettes were my favorite and they were the largest portion size. The dishes arrived in three courses and are beautifully plated.  I have to admit I have never enjoyed any meatless dishes so much and having three was more satisfying than I had expected.  Oh, and the cocktail menu is interesting; I tried the B. Arthur.  We arrived about a half hour earlier than our reservation but were seated immediately. It was quiet at that time, 6 p.m, but became very busy within the hour. Although it seemed busy, we did not feel any pressure to do anything but enjoy our meals. I appreciated the dimly lit, relaxed yet classy vibe of the setting.",0.9825,0.828,0.163,0.009,0.5055599472990778

2012-07-21,3.0,"I've been to Green Zebra twice now, and both times the experience has run a full range from disappointing to amazing.   Always amazing: The service and food presentation.  They have truly top-notch, attentive servers who know everything on the food and drink menu backwards and forwards, and a great deal of thought has clearly gone into the visual aesthetics of each dish. Always disappointing: The atmosphere.  To be fair, the problem isn't entirely their fault.  In general the space itself is pretty nice (with the exception of the tabletops - I think they're going for ratty-chic, but it isn't really working).  The problems are: (1) if you're a party of 2 on a weekend, you're almost guaranteed to be squeezed so close to other parties of 2 that you'll have no sense of privacy in your conversation at all and (2) many of the other diners dress like they're going for a day at the beach.  With a drink or two the check winds up being in the neighborhood of $80 per person - for that price I expect not be surrounded by people in shorts, sandals, and short sleeve button-ups with the top 3 buttons undone.  Instituting a dress code (even a fairly lax one) could make this place ten times classier. There's a wide range in food quality.  On the one hand, last winter I had Brussels sprouts that completely changed the way I think about Brussels sprouts; it was really one of the most amazing things I've ever eaten.  On the other hand, I recently had mushrooms that were little more than pan fried (without even so much as salt for seasoning) in too much oil with a few pieces of asparagus tossed in (granted they were considered only a side dish - but then again, so were the Brussels sprouts).  Most things I've eaten here have been pretty good, but given the effort they put into service and food presentation, I expect the food to be better than ""pretty good."" The high points of the restaurant certainly push it into the gourmet range, but the low points are major disappointments.  I'll go back because there aren't really many veg*n fine dining options available in Chicago (at least, there aren't many that I'm aware of), but I'm certainly not blown away by Green Zebra.  It is perhaps deserving of more than 3 stars, but I just can't give it 4 so 3 will have to do.",0.9931,0.805,0.154,0.042,0.5280476190476191

Then, of course, I discovered that Green Zebra serves brunch, which just so happens to be my favorite (and, obviously, the best) meal. So on a swelteringly warm Sunday, my fellow vegetarian foodie and I made the pilgrimage from the depths of the south side up to West Town. I ordered the eggs in a basket, and he the chilaquiles. We split the truffle fries.  I'm a bit of an eggs in a basket connoisseur, and these were divine. A single perfectly cooked, wonderfully drippy egg encased in some sort of a bread/pastry hybrid. Yum. The maple glazed carrots and asparagus were also delicious. The chilaquiles, while lacking the presentation of the eggs, were also really yummy. Total Mexican comfort food.

2012-04-09,1.0,"I unfortunately, had an extremely horrible experience while dining at Green Zebra with a group of friends.  And it would be safe to say the group I was dining with would agree.   If you are reading this review, I highly advise you put down whatever you may be eating as you could potentially start to feel ill.   To start, the six of us sat down to what would appear to be a trendy, clean restaurant, and pleasant waiter in a not so appealing area of the city. Given the menu was priced very high for what you would be eating (no meat, no fish), we thought it must be great, and when I say great, I mean exceptionally great.   We were able to get through our first course, no problem, at least that is what we think (who knows what we really ate).  As we received our second course, 20 minutes later, I was utterly shocked, and instantly disgusted to see a creepy crawler moving on my dear friend's plate.  We all instantly dropped our forks, we could hear the clanks all at the same time as our mouths remained open from the disbelief in witnessing the inch long worm, working his way in and out of the croquette.  How is this possible?  Well I'll start by explaining what the restaurant hostess/manager gave as her explanation.   As she kindly took the plate away from our table she apologized and offered us dessert on the house.  We all looked at each other and said ""hmmm, dessert on the house?""  As my friend kindly thanked her for the offer, he graciously declined as he no longer had an appetite.  And then I said to our friends, ""dessert on the house?"", that would entail needing to still get through our other two courses before dessert, and did she really think or expect us to want to eat another two courses, not including dessert, of food prepared in her kitchen? The more we processed what she said, we all suddenly felt like she was regarding this as a normal experience. As we kindly asked her to come back to the table, we reiterated the fact that we ALL lost our appetites as we explained we have all dined around the world - in fact, between the six of us, it is safe to say with combined trips to Australia, Thailand, China, India, ALL of Europe, most of southern Africa, and back to the US, NONE of us have ever seen a worm in our food.  Not at home, and not at any restaurant.  As we explained this to her, she said their food comes in fresh from a farm daily, reason why there is a worm.  As she presented our $315 bill ( this was just for the first and second course) we were totally shocked and offended she would even present such and egregious amount to us after what we had experience.  After a long week of work, and a planned dinner out for the one of the two nights we are free, to completely ruin our appetites and make us feel like we chose to eat at some dump, did she, the hostess/manager, really expect $315 for a ruined dining experience? The answer is yes.  And wow, were we even more offended that a powerless hostess/manager was running a restaurant that was offering such high prices, but no customer service to back.   Once we realized she had no guts, and really had no business running a restaurant, we kindly asked for the chef.  And in the midst of all this back and forth nonsense, another patron dining next to our table rudely chimed in our conversation and called my husband an inappropriate name.  As our waiter came back to our table to defend this other patron, we about had enough.  When the chef arrived and explained the worm was his fault, and apologized, I realized the chef is the only thing this restaurant has going on.  Unfortunately though, a good restaurant requires more than a great chef - if the hostess/manager and waiter are making poor impressions on their guests/clients the chef will have no one to cook for.  The point is, all it takes is one bad experience for a restaurant to show their true colors.",0.8141,0.815,0.1,0.085,0.5277081575246131

2012-03-09,5.0,"Absolutely Phenomenal!!! My recent visit to Green Zebra was simply perfect. This is my 3rd trip to Green Zebra. No exaggeration here, but this visit was the zenith for me in terms of service for any single dinning experience I have ever had. This is owed to the entire team. I have to highlight ""Gustavo"" here as he was our waiter and obviously the one we interfaced with, but my story will explain how this restaurant/team went above and beyond the call of duty. We were celebrating my mother's 60th birthday, which obviously is a big occasion and says a lot that we decided on Green Zebra for the day. The hurdle enters the path for the restaurant with my wife's restrictive diet, which basically eliminates sugar, yeast, soy, meat, dairy, and on and on and on......point being that most main stream or for that matter fine dinning establishments would be besides themselves with the special request. Well, I called ahead and Green Zebra had a menu printed up specifically tailored to my wife's dietary needs. WOW! Problem, I did not communicate the diet very well and every item on the menu was out-of-bounds for my wife!! Typically response from 99% of restaurants = sorry that is the best we can do.  Green Zebra's (Gustavo, and the Kitchen) response. Please write down on the back of the special menu we printed up what you can eat, let us know how many dishes you can have and we will wow you. My wife simply said, ""I would be happy with a bed of greens and tomatoes...I don't want to trouble you.""  Well, trouble is not in the vocabulary at Green Zebra. The team insisted that they meet her dietary needs and created an amazing culinary journey that any guest would relish! Thank you 1,000 times over. This is perhaps the finest moment of service I have ever seen given in a restaurant! My meal was also amazing from top to bottom, but it was the service that made me realized how much this team really cares about its customers. Congratulations and thank you for putting the customer first. I almost hate how this review does not focus enough on the actual dishes, but others below pay good measure there. When we all go out to eat it is so nice to be treated and oh how we were this night! Great job Green Zebra!!!!!",0.9985,0.746,0.224,0.03,0.455209388720027
2012-03-09,5.0,"I was completely blown away by my meal here. I had come with high expectations, especially given the rave reviews I had heard, but the vegetarian-only menu may have re-calibrated them. I'm not necessarily a meat lover, but I hate the idea of not being allowed to eat something. A little more expensive than I had expected, but it was definitely worth the money for a nicer evening out. The four of us shared ten dishes, but we focused mainly on the heavier dishes on the bottom half of the menu. When the food first came out, I was a little disappointed. The small plates were very small, and I wondered if we would actually need twenty dishes. But, the food service is deceptive, and over the course of the meal and a few nibbles of each dish, I became full without realizing it. My favorite dish was the Organic Farm Egg with smoked potato puree and country sourdough; although the potato puree was essentially a fancier preparation of mashed potatoes, the smoky flavor made this dish distinct, and I unabashedly swiped my fork across the bowl several times to get every last tasty bite. My dining companions were partial to the Chestnut and Truffle Agnolotti, my second favorite dish: Green Zebra was generous with the truffle oil and the combination with chestnut, an underappreciated ingredient, in a tube of what tasted like fresh pasta gave this tiny dish its robust, complex flavor. The sweet potato dumplings and crispy risotto cake were also memorable. I would not recommend the focaccia, which was slightly cold and difficult to chew. Desserts--the milk/dark chocolate pave with creme fraiche ice cream and the squash cheesecake were quite tasty. The storefront isn't named, so the restaurant is a little hard to find. It is actually just at the corner of Chicago and Armour. Price: ~$50-60 per person for dinner",0.9719,0.815,0.124,0.062,0.4812916666666668

My husband had the eggs-in-a-basket, which were also excellent. While the portions didn't look big (certainly compared to gargantuan omelets and mountains of hash served for brunch elsewhere), we left feeling very satisfied.

2012-02-22,4.0,"Green Zebra's awesome staff helped transform what could have been a lousy night into a wonderful one. On our way to the restaurant, our first time, the exhaust pipe on my car broke in half, the muffler started dragging on the ground. In short, we were not going to make our reservation. An hour and a half later, after the nice AAA guy had removed the tail pipe and wired the remaining bits back onto the car, we finally arrived at the restaurant.  Now, this is restaurant week, so they were pretty darn full. But, after a short wait they managed to seat us, even though our reservation was long gone. We ordered one restaurant week menu straightaway, and then ordered a few more dishes off the main menu. Here are the results: Fabulous:  - Crispy Sweet Potato Dumplings with salsify purée, blood orange, toasted black sesame (RW Menu) - Crispy Rice Noodle, baby bok choy, miso glazed turnips, lotus root, cashews  - Shaved Apple & Tatsoi Salad, sweet chili-eggplant purée, cilantro, crispy parsnip - Rice pudding with grapefruit sorbet Good:  - Celery Root & Quinoa Croquettes, toasted black walnuts, sesame seeds, preserved lemon (RW Menu) - Crispy Sweet Potato Dumplings, crabapple ketchup, walnut-sage pesto, honeycrisp apple  - Meyer Lemon Tart with toasted meringue, orange tuille (RW Menu) - Apples Charlotte with cinnamon ice cream, carmel, and mint oil Disappointing:   - Sage Spaetzle with roasted cauliflower, crispy kale, almonds, brown butter (RW Menu) In other words, we were very glad we didn't both get the Restaurant Week Menu, because most of the best items weren't on it.  So here's why Green Zebra gets four instead of five stars. The spaetzle was embarrassingly bland. A dud of a dish for any restaurant, but especially for one that seems to pride itself on complex, colorful flavors and interesting textures.  Moreover, we had only ordered it in the first place because it was the only one of the three entrees that was close to being vegan on the Restaurant Week Menu. Dear Green Zebra, if you advertise yourself as a vegan-friendly restaurant, you should at least try to put one vegan option in for each course on your RW Menu.  Finally, we had to order extra dishes because we were still hungry at the end of the meal. The RW Menu simply didn't include enough food. Not cool. We ended up spending a lot more than we had expected to. That being said, the extra items we ended up ordering were very yummy. In sum, service and ambiance get 5 stars, food gets 4 stars, and Restaurant Week Menu gets 2.5 stars.",0.9828,0.876,0.094,0.03,0.5218720821661997

When I mentioned to the hubby that I made reservations at a vegetarian restaurant he made a yuck face. I promised he'd like this restaurant and as soon as we sat down he admitted the menu looked pretty good. Our waitress suggested 3-4 dishes per person, which I thought was a bit excessive. I'm kind of a pig (probably the only time pig has been used in a Green Zebra review) and even I couldn't eat 3-4 dishes on my own. I think ordering 2 dishes per person is plenty. You'll want to share here because everything is pretty tasty.  I was quite satisfied with everything we ordered on our last visit, but favorites included the organic farm egg, sweet potato dumplings and crispy rice noodles.

The decor and atmosphere of the restaurant is chic and modern. I really liked the layout and we got a great table against the far wall tucked under the stairs. We could see the whole restaurant but we weren't in the way of traffic or near the door (it was cold out that night!). The music was eclectic but great. We both had cocktails, which were super tasty. We ordered everything right away, since our server warned that the hot dishes might take awhile. The mushroom pate was incredible, and our hot dishes, the Mustard & Caraway Spaetlze Stroganoff and Sauteed Mushrooms were fantastic. The cheese plate was brilliant and even my after-dinner coffee was excellent. The dishes were perfect for two people to share.

The egg was poached so soft and perfectly, and the potatoes had this amazing smokiness to it that I would swear was a bacon flavor if I didn't know this place was vegetarian! I would eat that every day if I could, its that good. We also got the sharing plate for dessert which had a dragonfruit sorbet, vegan chocolate cupcake, and these amazing whiskey pastry cream puffs.

This is an upscale restaurant and you should definitely only come here if you're prepared to spend a little money. However, I thought for the amount of money we paid, we shouldn't have walked out hungry. The portions were too small.",0.9942,0.738,0.262,0.0,0.6613167534220166
2011-12-02,5.0,"Let me start off by saying that I am a meat eater. A meal without meat is not usually a meal worth eating; however Green Zebra proved me wrong. Very wrong. Went last night for din din and I was blown away, and my stomach was blown up by all the delicious food I ingested. The service was stellar - great recommendation on a bottle of wine and dishes to try, very attentive with clearing plates and refilling water, etc.  Here are the dishes that I recall (I think I'm missing one): 1. Homemade bread - amazing. So simple, but tasty. The bread was warm and soft, perfect for the butter and jelly that came with it. Great start. 2. Baby beets salad - I don't think I've ever had beets before. I swear. After this I want them all the time.  3. Butternut squash soup - this was my favorite thing. I could've bathed in it. The chunks of apple in the smooth soup totally made it for me. 4. Sweet potato dumplings - like mini pumpkin pies in dough. Could've been dessert. 5. Mushroom spaetzle stroganoff - admittedly this was my least favorite dish. I think by this point I was getting so full that my taste buds were revolting. 6. Poached egg - clearly there is a reason this is on the menu time after time, because it's amazing. Perfectly cooked, the bread was toasty and great to sop up all the tastiness on the plate. If you haven't tried it, I highly recommend it. I'm slowly starting a list of places I want to try, and this may get added back on as a return visit in the future.",0.9957,0.764,0.204,0.032,0.5710044642857144

2011-11-09,1.0,"I'm sad to be giving Green Zebra a terrible review, because I've had some genuinely delicious food there and fine dining for vegetarians isn't exactly easy to come by in the encased-meat capital of the USA. However, I'll probably never step foot in here again. Green Zebra is expensive. It's very pricey for vegetarian food, and it's a special-occasion kind of meal for us. The sort of thing we stretch our budget to afford when a special menu sounds particularly tempting, or when we really want a nice, relaxed evening out after a rotten day at work. Basically, a nice date night kind of meal.  On a recent trip on just such a rotten day, we sat down to our dinner reservation for their special potato-themed menu. The restaurant was very chilly inside, and I wasn't dressed appropriately. I had a large coat on for wearing outdoors, but the light sweater I was wearing under the coat wasn't sufficient, and it's not really comfortable to dine in your coat. We were seated in a booth, and I had my legs tucked in next to me to my side to keep warm, instead of dangling my short legs off the edge of the booth (not comfortable for any length of time, let alone for a long meal). We placed our order, opted to share the wine pairing, and awaited our first course. 10 minutes later, it was brought out, and was pretty good. We awaited our second course. The wine pairing for the second course was brought out about five minutes after they cleared the first course. So far, so good. I tasted the wine, then set it aside to save for tasting with the food. 10 minutes later, still no second course. 15 minutes after they'd brought out the wine, our waitress came by to say she'd asked the kitchen about our second course, and that it should be out shortly. 10 minutes after that, still no sign of it. At this point, we'd been waiting about 25 minutes for the second of four courses. We'd been in the restaurant about 45 minutes. We were famished after a long day at work, and I was very chilly, and very tired, but we were looking forward to the rest of the meal and understood it wasn't our server's fault the kitchen was running slowly, so we waited patiently. A woman approached me from behind and tapped me on the shoulder. Startled, I looked up to see the hostess (or someone...?) standing next to me, leaning in quite close to whisper in my ear. She requested that I take my legs off the bench, where they were still tucked in beside me. Just to clarify, the only part of my shoes touching the bench was the outer edge, along the side of my foot. No part of the soles of my shoes were touching the bench, no excess skin was being exposed under my skirt (I'm certain of this), and I couldn't sit comfortably with my feet dangling off the edge. She was insistent that I put my legs down and dangle them off the edge of the bench, and gave no explanation for her request. Shocked and horribly embarrassed, I agreed and she went on her way back to her post. Just a moment later, our second course finally arrived. I was seething with frustration and embarrassment, and no longer comfortably seated. My husband hadn't heard what their staff person said to me, but he could tell I was unhappy because I didn't touch the food, despite having waited for it for over 35 minutes. We flagged our waitress down to apologize and left, stopping somewhere else for dinner on the way home. So... okay. A bad experience, certainly, but I do like some of their food and there are few vegetarian options in the city. At our second dinner that night, I tweeted at Green Zebra mentioning that I'd had a bad customer service experience and that I had been looking forward to trying the special menu. No response, but the Twitter account continued to retweet any and all compliments others posted about the restaurant. A couple of weeks later, still upset, I posted a comment on the Green Zebra Facebook account. It was deleted the next day. No response, message, or comment from Green Zebra. Clearly, they don't care about actually satisfying customers (I mentioned in my comment I would have been happy with just *an apology* of all things). Anything uncomplimentary is just wiped out, not acknowledged, and they made no effort to actually retain me as a customer.  For a $150 meal, I want a pleasant experience in every regard. I want a restaurant that will go above and beyond the bare minimum to provide excellent food, excellent service, in a welcoming environment. Green Zebra has not fulfilled that expectation; in fact they've gone out of their way to provide the exact opposite of a good experience.",-0.1931,0.774,0.112,0.114,0.49207744636316053

It was delicious, though! For our third and final course, I chose the Roasted Eggplant with braised artichokes, olives, Romesco sauce, toasted almonds, and ricotta.

It was spring and we ordered fiddlehead ferns, which we love, but they weren't washed properly and were full of sand, and to make matters worse, really weren't properly cooked. That a ""nice"" restaurant could take something so delicious and simple and make it so bad really turned me off. I can't recall the other items I ate, but I really disliked the meal, and I've thought about it ever since and warned folks not to expect much of their dining experience at Green Zebra. Over the years people I knew did eat at Green Zebra, and they repeatedly reported to me that ""it's better, it really is better than it used to be!"" It took me a long time to return, but I finally decided to give it another shot and went in for dinner recently. I'd say that it was a better visit than the first. All of our food was properly washed and prepared. But, this is supposed to be a ""nice"" restaurant, so I'm expecting the food to be very yummy. And, really, it's only ""meh"" quality. The server went on and on about the season based menu, but it's September and there were many many items featured in dishes that are spring produce. I know. I go to the farmers market and I haven't seen these vegetables since April/May. So, it's not really seasonal in my opinion. And, it's also not delicious. I have no problem paying $12 for a small plate that is amazing...mouthwatering, every bite a wonderous experience, but I do have a problem paying that much for food that I easily prepare at home on a weeknight. Again, nothing was actually bad this time, but I don't plan to return. If I lived across the street and it was 20% better and 20% cheaper then I'd probably go back, but it's not worth the trek from Logan Square.

Our server made sense of the menu for us, and ensured that we were comfortable with what we were ordering, but also made sure that we were getting a great first experience at GZ. The menu is divided so that it begins with cooler, lighter flavors and textures, moving gradually to warmer, heavier textures.  At our server's suggestion, for the three of us, we went with the 5-course chef's tasting (all items off-menu), and ordered 5 more small plates to accompany. No, I can't remember everything we had, but here were some highlights: -Seared halloumi, with watermelon with red onion balsamic jam -Wheatberries with plum and feta cheese -Black bean dumplings with chimichurri -Caramleized onion soup AND chilled corn and radish soup -Salade lynnoaise, with shitake ""bacon"" -Illinois sweet corn succotash ...and some other amazing treats. Delicious. We paired it all with a bottle of Graves' Bordeaux and the meal truly was complete. 10 small plates later (including dessert), we were most pleased-- and surprisingly full!

Being a vegetarian I feel like part of me automatically has to like the restaurant but the flavors in all of the dishes are so amazing that I don't even have to do that. My friend and I went in for dinner a few weeks ago without a reservation (mistake! definitely make a reservation!) for what we thought was an early dinner but there were no tables available because there was a private party going on. The hostess told us that we could have someone else's table if we were willing to finish our dinner in an hour. I could see some people not being too enthused about this, but being that we were out on a school night, it was perfect for us! Between the two of us, we ordered four dishes, which was definitely enough food for the both of us. I don't think I've ever been here and had a bad experience with any of the dishes. I think it's just a matter of determining which certain aspects of the dishes you would really love and ruling out the ones that just don't sound appealing to you. The presentation of the dishes is always amazing and I always feel like it's an experience to eat here.  Everything was delicious and since they were trying to make sure that we were out of there in an hour, the food came out quickly and our table was cleared quickly after each dish as well, which we both really liked. I still believe we received stellar service and we didn't feel rushed at all. In fact, the staff was really appreciative of us being able to finish our dinner in less than an hour, which was nice of them.

2011-08-01,2.0,"Let me start off by saying that I love vegetables. And I don't believe that some type of meat dish must be present to serve a valid dinner. Vegetables taste great. So much so that I've spent the better part of this summer trying to grow my own. It's been a time consuming but rewarding experience that has yet to reach it's full potential. Heading in I was expecting amazing veggie courses from Green Zebra. Just like if you visit a steak house you expect a fantastic steak. That same thought was applied here. The problem is that I left satisfied with my dinner but in no way impressed with the 14 courses I tried.  Rather than bore you with details about all 14 courses, my overall experience was average. Some dishes were home runs but others struck out quite a few times. For a vegetable driven restaurant, this surprised me greatly. The fresh fettuccine was outstanding. Creamy, rich, and with texture from the peas, I could have easily eaten five of these. Had this been a dinner sized portion and the only thing I ate, 5 stars would easily be awarded. This was the only 'wow' dish I had. The flat bread and chickpea tajine were painfully boring. The flat bread was in dire need of some moisture and the chickpea tajine was served with a mini pita on the side that when biting in gave you cottonmouth from it's dryness. I was going through water so fast I half expected a water pitcher to show up at our table. Speaking of the staff, they did a great job. Very attentive and not once did I need to get their attention for anything. I'm not a big service person but Green Zebra's service is top notch.  The vegan cupcake for dessert was like a rock it was so dense. For being a chocolate item, the chocolate flavor was surprisingly lacking. It's clear they don't use enough chocolate or cocoa powder as it tasted like a flour only cupcake. On a positive note, the whole grain bread and butter here were divine. They give you one piece but I'm sure they would provide more if asked. The butter was fresh, tangy and perfect with a little salt on top. My mouth is watering thinking about it. But as a whole, Green Zebra let down. Some dishes hit high marks but many were on the cutting edge of average. Great veggie dishes can be found at non-veggie driven restaurants and I'll stick to those in the future.",0.9977,0.724,0.217,0.059,0.5702403062886934

My mom doesn't eat any meat or fish, so this seemed like a solid option. Very nice interior. Nice service. Super attentive. Fancypants. This place dresses to impress, for sure.  The Green Zebra is small plates, so the ""average"" person eats 3-4 dishes. The menu is broken into three sections - salads, lighter flavors and heavier flavors. You are advised to pick one of each.  My husband and I divided on conquered. Between us (for entrees), we ordered: Mushroom Pate* Lettuce Salad Black bean potstickers Asparagus Crepe* Duck Egg* Flatbread Spiced Hushpuppies* Mushroom Pate was a home run. It was smokey and delicious. It came with pieces of toast that had some type of sweet jam on it. It was delicious. The lettuce salad was good, but light.  The asparagus crepe came with a Camembert fondue and morel mushrooms, which was awesome. It was full of lightly cooked asparagus. The black bean dumplings were good, but the dough was awfully thick and it seemed like it was super fried. The chimmichurri sauce it came with was delicious, as was the queso fresco. The hushpuppies were an awesome, junk-foodish type snack. I could have eaten so many of those.  The duck egg was one of my favorite dishes of the night. It was a poached duck egg on a sweet potato puree with pieces of toast. Absolutely divine. It was smokey, like bacon. Dreamy. The flatbread was kind of disappointing, as the dough, was, well, really doughy, and very unlike other flatbreads I have had. The broccoli on top of the flatbread was charred to the point that when you touched it, it kind of burst into a cloud of dust. I wish I ordered the grits instead of the flatbread.  I've starred the entrees that I thought were the strongest. This meal could have varied quite a bit (in terms of stars), depending on what you ordered. The highs were out of the park, and the lows weren't terrible, but they weren't inspiring, either.  I got the glazed white chocolate mousse with raspberries for dessert, as well as a cup of coffee. My husband got the coconut/lime sorbet and tapioca, which was really interesting/different.  I loved my dessert, it was plate-lickin'-good. All in all, we had a great night.

The black bean wontons were perfectly fried but the only real flavor on the plate was the fried wonton itself, not the filling or sauce.

The ingredients in the fettucini dish were great (Porcini, pea pods) - but the noodles were really awful and blandly sauced. There was in fact a lot of bland on the table and the heavily spiced dishes like the carrot soup and chick pea tagine were one-note melodies of strong assertive flavors that don't present complex experiences in waves of flavor.

The ambience was great; our waitress was very nice and helpful, and the decor was classy yet fun. One thing I'll mention though is that the waitress told us to get 2-4 plates per person, so we got 3 each.  With drinks and the bread they bring, 3 per person was too much food... we were really full by the time the third plate came.  You really only need 2 plates per person.

2011-04-01,3.0,"I really don't mind eating vegetarian.  Actually, I quite enjoy it.  Often times I cook vegetarian for myself at home, so I, personally, wouldn't think twice about dining at an all vegetarian restaurant.  In my mind, at least it would be a bit healthier knowing that I'd have plenty of options that aren't covered in the pork fat fad.  It was only a matter of convincing my meat-loving man that he could, in fact, be satisfied on a vegetarian meal before I could make a reservation.  And for this reason, I chose to dine at Green Zebra for brunch rather than dinner.  It seemed to be the easier meal to swallow (hehe) considering eggs and french toast and all the breakfast items that don't necessarily require meat.  And so, he agreed and we were off! First to arrive were the corn cake Madeleines; a nice little treat to enjoy as we read over the menu.  They were served with a honey compound butter and a home made raspberry spread.  I'd say they were closer to the cornbread family than to that of the sweet pastry, since they didn't seem textually any different than a cornbread batter baked in a Madeleine tin.  But they were delicious, none the less.  It was a good start. I had a little bit of a difficult time deciding on the rest of brunch as there were a few interesting looking items on the menu.  I talked myself out of the grits with mustard greens, mushrooms and poached egg after realizing that it is all too similar to something I'd make at home.  (My version is polenta, spinach, mushroom, poached egg.  Same dif.)  There was also a breakfast burrito and eggs benny with red peppers that had potential for us, but we decided against those as well.  And so we settled on a couple of things that were appealing to us both (and sounded hearty enough for he-who-is-frightened-by-the-idea-of-a-meatless-meal). First, flatbread with bourbon glazed mushrooms, white truffle and a fried egg.  Sounds delicious, no?  I thought so.  Well, as it sometimes goes, it was better on paper than in actuality.  Bourbon?  What bourbon?  Where?  Not a trace of flavor leading me to believe that bourbon was actually used, let alone as a glaze which one would expect lend a pretty distinctive flavor.  And the bread, itself?  Kinda lousy.  It wasn't soft or chewy or crispy, but instead baked to the point that you really had to pull when you took a bite.  You know what I mean?  You really had to work for it.  And the truffle (oil)?  Again, where?  Did someone forget that component all together?  That's certainly what it seemed like.  I didn't get one whiff of it.  And the egg was a little over cooked for my liking, too.  I like the yolk to be runny all the way through, rather than having the outside already set, as in this case.   But in all honesty, it wasn't all bad.  It was actually very flavorful.  And beautiful.  Had it been called 'flatbread with sauteed mushrooms, fried egg, arugula and parm,' I probably would have still ordered it but had different expectations.  Expectations that the dish could've lived up to, because that's really what it was.     We'd also ordered the buttermilk biscuit with mushroom gravy and sunny side up eggs.  Mmmmm... gravy, I thought.  But again, technically, a miss.  The biscuit was overworked and dense and the gravy was so thick, it was tacky.  Literally.  I mean, it stood up on my fork all by itself.  Not to mention that it was heavy with cream.  If it was me, I would have nixed the cream altogether and used only milk and mushroom stock (which, I can't say I'm convinced there was any of at all).  I did like the pieces of actual mushrooms, however, and they did lend good flavor, but I'm not sure they needed to be minced to smithereens.  But whatever, that was the least of this dish's problems.  Had they served us a well made biscuit and had the gravy been loosened to an actual gravy consistency, this could have been a tasty, meatless-but-hearty breakfast item.  But instead, we just got a poor excuse for biscuits and gravy, sausage or not.   So, I guess my issue is this:  Green Zebra missed for me on technicalities, not overall flavor or issues due to a lack of meat.  Can they get away with putting out poorly prepared food because vegetarians are happy to be able to order anything and everything on the menu?  Is it not held to the same standards and criteria as a non-vegetarian restaurant?  I think it should be! The restaurant itself is very nice.  It's small, maybe 40 seats, but cool and modern in its decor with a lot of clean lines and angles, and bright, natural light coming from the wall of windows.   As far as service goes, our server left a little something to be desired.  She was not the most friendly person I've ever come across but, luckily for her, the support staff was on it.  She basically took our order and dropped our check and they did the rest.  And they did it well and with a smile.  The food was a little slow coming out of the kitchen as well (as were the drinks.....",0.998,0.822,0.138,0.04,0.49698412698412714

We started out with the baby lettuce salad.  It was decent but lacked crispiness or a crunch, maybe some peanuts.  Next was the ROASTED PUMPKIN SOUP, which was amazing.  Creamy and filling, it really hit the spot on a cold Chicago evening.  I recommend it to anyone that goes here.  The sweet potato croquette was very good and was kissed with a smokey flavor that was splendid.  The Risotto was good and the mascarpone made it really buttery and it had hints of a citrus taste.  The flatbread was the final item we ate and it was great.  It was more filling than the previous items and the goat cheese with pumpkin seeds provided a unique taste.   The meal ended up being a tad on the expensive side, but I can see why.  The ingredients are fresh the dishes are pretty distinctive for a vegetarian spot.  As with most vegetarians places, the dishes are bit small so I would not recommend it for a big eater.  It is a really nice date spot, especially with the intimate booth setting.  I would go back again, but probably on a special occasion.",0.9974,0.75,0.241,0.009,0.5865250965250965

My fiance and I went here last night to check out Green Zebra for Chef's Week.  It has been a much anticipated wait, especially given all the rave reviews I have heard from friends and family, so expectations were fairly high.  Upon entering, I was a bit taken aback.  I am not sure what I was expecting the decor to be like, but certainly not drab and dreary with dark tables and furniture.  I did like that they offered to take your coat though, even though we opted to keep ours in case we were cold. We were seated immediately as we had reservations for 6pm.  I am not sure we needed them though because there were only a few other couples there, and even a family with a kid.  I wasn't expecting to see kids at Green Zebra, but it's good to know it can be a family place. To be fair, I will rate Green Zebra as follows: Decor - 3 stars Service - 4 stars Food - 2 stars If you like salt, (very pricey salt), then you'll like this place.  I like salt, but not when that is all you can taste.  I felt that every dish here, sans dessert, was extremely salty.  I was so disappointed.  I had really high hopes for the food here.  We did the prix fixe menu and both of us ordered the opposite of one another off the Chef's Week Menu below: First Course Werp Farm Heirloom Beets, cracked fingerling potato, horseradish, confit kumquat - this was actually very good,and not overly salty or Cardamom Spiced Carrot Soup, pickled fennel, lemon creme fraiche, candied ginger - also good, but definitely starting to taste a lot of salt Second Course Crispy Chow Fun Noodles, lotus root, charred shishito pepper, sesame-shoyu, tempura - had the potential to be good if I could taste more than salt or Foraged Mushroom Risotto, Cerignola olives, toasted pumpkin seeds, mustard greens, mascarpone - not good at all, and I think the salt container fell in this dish Dessert Citrus Tapioca Pearls, slow-roasted pineapple, coconut sorbet or Dark Chocolate Tart, toasted marshmallow, salted caramel ice cream To be fair, I am not a dessert person, but I can be persuaded to eat it if it wows me enough.  Unfortunately this dessert was not wowing me.  My fiance didn't seem to mind it so much, but he's a big dessert person so I have a feeling he would have liked it either way.  As for the wine pairings, I will say the wine was good especially since it helped take the salt edge off of my palate.   I was pretty disappointed with the food here, but my friend tells me it must have been an off night and that I should give it another chance.  Maybe in a few months.  As for now, I wasn't too happy spending so much money on salt and I'll stick to Karyn's on Green which is walking distance from where we live and amazing vegetarian food where you don't mind paying the extra $$ for it.",0.9961,0.795,0.159,0.046,0.532084126984127

Although I'm not a vegetarian I enjoy eating at vegetarian restaurants and am open-minded to the experience. If you're not like this, then this is not the place for you. For instance, the guys in our party seemed to struggle with what to order since there was no meat on the menu. From the start I knew this would be a bumpy ride for them. Although I don't frequent high-end restaurants I am open-minded to the rare occasion that I go to one. If you're not like this, then this is not the place for you. As to be expected from a high-end restaurant, the portion sizes were small. Our waitress recommended we order 5 plates per person and suggested we even share. We wound up getting 3 plates per person and only sampled some of each others plates. And like most high-end restaurants the bill can add up fast. At a whopping $8-$12 per plate it's easy to do that here. So be prepared for that. As far as the food is concerned I felt that it was hit or miss. The onion soup was a bit of a miss only because I thought it was nothing special, especially for the price. However, my sister got the pumpkin soup and I thought it was phenomenal. I kept asking for a spoon-ful tasting! I did not get a salad but she did -- the pear salad. It was so flavorful and unique. I highly recommend it. Next, they brought out the Slow Roasted Shittake Mushrooms, crispy potato, savoy cabbage. Although I love mushrooms I felt this was overkill. It was too mushroom-y and I couldn't stop tasting the mushrooms long after I finished my plate. Also, it was was too greasy and oily. It tasted like it had been soaking in oil. My sister had the butternut squash dumplings. These were very good. Her boyfriend had the Spiced Hush Puppies with cheddar cheese. I thought they were nothing special and wish they were warmer than they were. He and his friend also had the Fresh Fettuccine with basil, pistachio, giardiniera, garlic, and parmesan. This was very tasty. Finally, I had the Country Flatbread with goat cheese, black trumpet mushroom, onion jam and pumpkin seed. This was delicious! I like how they brought out one dish at a time so you could really savor each dish, one plate at a time. Finally, the drinks... I got a glass of red wine. It was good. My sister got a mixed-drink w/ sake, vodka, lemongrass and cucumber in it. It was delish! And I wish I got that over my glass of wine. The ambiance is very zen-like with it's muted browns and soft greens. The waitstaff was friendly, helpful, and attentive. Since the waitress knew we were out celebrating my sister's birthday she brought out a slice of chocolate cake that was delicious. That was sweet of them. Unfortunately we were all too stuffed to polish it off but we definitely had a sample of two of it. Overall, I'm glad I finally checked this place out though I doubt I'd return.

For dinner, I went with the pear salad, pumpkin soup and butternut squash dumplings. Everything I ordered was delicious! However, some of the other meals that my friends ordered weren't too spectacular. I suppose since you're spending more than normal, you expect every dish to phenomenal. As far as the meals that were great, they are very tiny so that you take your time savoring each and every bite. I thought of the experience as comparable to wine tasting. You savor the taste of wine, but the intent is not to get wasted. Same here. They bring out each dish only after you've completed the previous dish. I like. The helpful server suggested that each person order 4-5 dishes and share. I felt very full from my 3 dishes and tasting from the other plates people ordered. I thought we were going to have to get a slice a pizza after our meal, but surprisingly, we were all stuffed! They also brought out a delicious chocolate cake for my birthday that was truly decadent.

2011-02-22,5.0,"Green Zebra sounds like a very pretentious place. It really is a pretentious place. However, don't let that fool you from the amazing food experience that consists of Green Zebra. To start with, the food is a little expensive - we're talking $10 a plate for small appetizer sized plates. However, they are actually pretty filling, and getting a total of 4 per person is pretty reasonable, and also sums up around where your bill will be. Location is very polite, service is pretty good as well.  I don't think I've ever heard anyone say that green Zebra was a bad place, so I don't know where people are having bad experiences.  Here's how our scenario went: we were 30 minutes late. However, we called a little early and let them know, and they accommodated us. No problem, and on a Saturday no less. Really, all of the food is amazing. Very unique, very creative tastes, and be sure to save room for dessert. The place has an awesome layout, and it's hard to describe all of the food other than that the taste combinations will not be expected but will be tasteful, for certain.  This is like getting a hotel room to buy a special beer from room service.

It was busy for a weeknight, so I can understand the desire to get everything going ASAP... but then once service did start, it was pretty darn slow. The shared plates were coursed out with long stretches in between, and by the time I tasted the sweet potato croquettes I had ordered, they were lukewarm.  Then, when our server finally presented the check, some kind of computer malfunction made splitting the bill more arduous than usual. In all, we were there for over three hours. Fortunately, the pear salad, grits, and pumpkin soup I tried were all very good -- the latter of which being one of the smoothest, creamiest versions I'd ever tried.  The ambiance is a bit awkward given the location.

We had mushroom pate with a fig-spread crouton and the burrata (soft cheese with lentils) to start, then moved on to spinach fettucine with pesto, and a pumpkin shomai (like a little wonton). We had been debating about adding the shiitake mushrooms as well, and our server surprised us by bringing some for us to try, on the house (so nice of him, and they were delicious!) We finished with the poached egg & toast and a mushroom porridge. By the time the mushroom porridge arrived I was seriously so stuffed that I couldn't eat another bite - but that might have had something to do with... ...the delicious cocktails. The Aviation is an excellent carryover from Spring (a sister restaurant which sadly closed last month), and we also really loved the cocktail with sake, hibiscus & lemongrass (the name escapes me now). I normally have a 1-drink maximum but ordered 2 of these, so you know they have to be good. Both were very light and refreshing, not too sweet or tart. In terms of ambience - it's a more bustling atmosphere than Spring, but same sort of feel to the decor - very chic and comforting/relaxing at the same time. We definitely both smelled like the kitchen after we left, but that is probably because we were seated at one of the small tables on the way back to the kitchen - try to get seated in the main dining area if you can.

After reading all the Yelp reviews, I honestly wasn't sure what to expect.  Would it be super snotty?  Would we leave wanting a burger?  Would my boyfriend's wallet be emptied?  All seemed like likely possibilities - but we were up for the challenge.  We arrived VERY early (30 minutes!) for our 7:00 reservation and were seated promptly by the host.  We ordered 2 plates each and a side of the cheese hush puppies for dinner.  Our waiter recommended two delicious white wines that we thoroughly enjoyed with the main courses.  We ordered the goat cheese flatbread, roasted shiitake mushrooms, sweet potato croquettes and risotto.  The flatbread and the mushrooms were probably my favorites, but the other two dishes were quite tasty as well.  And OH. MY. GOD. THE HUSH PUPPIES.  Sinful.  Absolutely delicious.  I very much enjoyed the amuse bouche and bread as well.   We also ordered the chocolate pave for dessert, and boyfriend decided to be a bit adventurous and order the recommended accompanying brandy (I had another glass of the aforementioned rec'd wine).  OH MY GOD IN HEAVEN THE SEQUEL. The dessert was PERFECT. The flavors of chocolate, peanut and sea salt complimented each other SO well and the brandy with it was divine (I might have snuck a sip or two...) I found the service to be polite but not fussy or pretentious, and the additional helpers (dish clearing, water refilling) to be attentive but not overbearing.  The space is intimate and lovely.  Our food arrived at perfectly timed intervals and we had a thoroughly enjoyable experience there. The ONLY thing I would mention that bumped it down from a solid 4.5 to 4 is that when my boyfriend tried to tip the host after he retrieved our coats, he sort of blew him off.  I'm sure they might have an arrangement where he can't accept tips, but a more appropriate response might have been, ""Thank you sir, but that isn't necessary.  Have a wonderful evening,"" or something along those lines.  My bf felt a little awkward - kind of a stunted end to an otherwise fabulous evening. To those who are worried about ordering enough to feel full, I would recommend you pay attention to how the items are grouped on the menu.  Bigger, more filling dishes are toward the bottom.  I would go with several of those if you are concerned about leaving hungry.  My bf is a tall Dutch guy and I'm known for a voracious appetite, and we both left feeling totally satisfied.

2011-01-20,4.0,"I have a dirty little secret - I used to be a vegetarian. It all started back in high school when I started hanging with some people who were also vegetarian. At the time I made the decision to stop eating meat it wasn't as trendy as it is now. It was a struggle with my parents to even allow me to become a vegetarian - I think it would have been easier for my family if I would have told them I was a lesbian rather then having to explain that I don't eat meat. I spend the first few years of my vegetarian life eating side dishes and explaining myself to people. Life got easier when I went away to college, but after 5 years of being a vegetarian I caved in at a Chinese buffet and ate General Tsao's Chicken -the rest is history. I wanted to take my friend (who has recently fallen off the veggie wagon) to Green Zebra for a while now. The idea of a high end vegetarian restaurant is intriguing and Green Zebra did not disappoint. This is the perfect place for a special occasion or date. The atmosphere is soothing and subdued thanks to the low lighting and Zen-like interior and the food was of superb quality making it easy to overlook the lack of meat. I started with the Cauliflower Pod de Crème which was so tasty that I could have eaten a heaping bowl of it. I'm normally not a huge dip person, but the cauliflower was the perfect mix of savory goodness. My friend and I each ordered soup. I had the French Onion and she had the Cream of Asparagus. This was probably the most disappointing course. My soup was good, but a little too much sweet onion flavor for me, especially following the intense flavor of the cauliflower. The Cream of Asparagus soup came cold and tasted like the garden. I probably would have liked it better if it was warm and maybe blended one more time, but we both agreed that the consistency was a little weird. After the soup I had these delicious dumplings with potato and garlic in them and my friend has some ridiculously tasty shitake mushroom rolls. For the main course we each had the scallops (the only meat on the menu) and they were cooked to perfection. They were served 2 on a plate (a little pricey at $17), but were sweet and tender. I was so full at this point that two turned out to be the perfect portion. I also have to note the cocktail menu. As a cocktail enthusiast I usually like to try 3-4 different drinks from the menu. I ordered the Bees Knees made with Death's Doors Gin and found it to be well balanced. I was quite impressed with their small, well-crafted cocktail list. What amazed me the most was when I looked at the non-alcoholic drinks and decided to order the Pink Peppercorn Thyme soda instead of getting a second cocktail- a very rare occasion indeed. This was one of the highlights of the night. It was subtly herbaceous and the peppercorn gave it a nice spicy aftertaste. I would highly recommend this and was quite impressed that were able to turn this die hard cocktail girl away from the booze for one night. Green Zebra certainly isn't cheap and you can expect to order 3-4 courses at $8-15 a pop. While I know this isn't in a lot of budgets these days this is a great place to take that special vegetarian in your life.",0.9988,0.738,0.207,0.055,0.5935311355311355

I am a meat eater and I love going to veggie restaurants. We were looking forward to going here for a long time. After our coats were taken we were told we could wait at the bar (the small bar with no seats) and have a drink. Okay, but where is the bartender? Oh, it's the lady who is taking the coats from the steady stream of people coming in. So after 15 minutes my fiance asked politely asked if there was a bartender. The coat lady/bartender goes, ""Yeah I am but it's busy. I'll be there in a second."" Okay, if this was a pizza parlor, fine. The coat lady can be the bartender and I could deal with waiting. But considering how much we paid for this damn meal, this was just unacceptable.  By the time our drink was poured we were ready to get seated.   Upon sitting down in the very beautiful space, our server promptly came up to us. He was very attentive the whole night and was a great server in general.  After reading the menu, we decided to do the tasting menu with the wine pairings.  The food was good, hands down. I have no complaints about the food whatsoever. The problem was the price.  I can justify spending money on a good meal and do frequently.  I just couldn't shake the feeling of being taken for when we got the bill. Spending over $260.00 on a meal of four SMALL courses of fancy veggies is not acceptable, not matter how good those fancy veggies are. Take $100 or so off the bill and this review would have been 4 stars.

It's fine, since I love cooking and make rather tasty things on my own the majority of the time anyway. However.

It was tasty, and the broth had a rich carrot taste that I liked but I wanted some *oomph*...Perhaps a bottle of Sriracha on the table could combat the mildness? *Cous cous and cauliflower salad topped with a parmesan crisp: an awesome menagerie of textures and flavors And then. AND THEN.  DESSERTS. Amazing Jessica S. ordered one of each of the desserts for the table. For the record, I wuv her. My favorite?

The service is impeccable.  They don't go out of their way to explain things, but that's because the portions are tapas-sized, and you'll be done in two bites, anyways.  Plus the prices, in case you haven't noticed, are a fraction of what you'd pay at Charlie Trotter's or the Palm, though the food is of no lesser quality and probably more original. It is very rare to find a vegetarian restaurant that actually caters to meat eaters--and does so with success.  The reason, I think, is the lack of tofu/seitan/soy, and their reliance on fresh produce instead.  Recommended are the risotto, ginger dumplings, and whatever soup is in season, along with the ganache. The wine list is pricey, but that's how an upscale vegetarian restaurant sustains itself without inflating the cost of the food--and I admire them for it.  I do think the decor is a bit gloomy, but that what most Americans consider romantic.  And at least you can hear. People also complain about the neighborhood, but if it's important to you to pay for your surroundings, then go to a tourist trap down on Dearborn.

Rather than having creative vegan dishes as options at the very least, they have to put obscure animal products on everything (quail eggs or goat cheese or whatever other animal is hip for extensive exploitation). If you don't like the starring role in that one vegan dish, then you might as well be a vegan at a steakhouse because you'll be unable to find anything remotely vegan. When you can veganize something, it's missing some key ingredient that made it filling to begin with. Then, you leave having spent three times more on dinner than you needed to, and you're still hungry. Service here was fine, but nothing exceptional.

A: green zebra. the sweet potato croquettes reminded me mostly of fried plantains and after evaluating both, i'd rather eat plantains.  there's no clear difference between ""courses"" on the menu, but there was a reeeeeeally long delay between when we received our first 3 items and when the last 2 showed up. its cool to create some space between bringing things, but that was a long time, guys.  the forbidden black rice had a consistency similar to tapioca pudding and the cannellini bean stew was more of a tiny, kind of burned casserole.  the chocolate pave we had for dessert was good, but its hard to make me dislike a dessert. the creme fraiche ice cream may have been my favorite part of the meal.  my bottom line is that our food just wasn't that good and the place is kind of cramped. i guess i can see the appeal if you'd like to impress someone easily impressed, but i can't imagine i would go back.",0.9905,0.811,0.147,0.042,0.457882882882883

If you want to feel posh, privileged, ""healthy"", and trendy, this is the place for you.  Patrons seem into couture, status, and trendy vegetarian diets--a snap-judgment that becomes more apt once you experience the tiny food itself.   To their credit, the Pink Peppercorn-Thyme Soda, a spicy-sweet, amazing, and mouth-watering concoction, shows the restaurant's quirky ingenuity at its best.  The food, however, failed to win me over--mainly because the portions are so tiny that you barely get the opportunity to enjoy them. The silliness began with the complimentary bread--the bread server, I suppose, appeared after an interminably long wait to present one piece of precious bread to each of us.  Still starving, trying to make that odd pineapple juice amuse bouche last as long as possible, we endured another round of intense waiting before our mini-meals.  The Grilled Hearts of Palm salad, though fresh and sharp, was just too heavy on the bitter Asian greens.  The Onion Soup Trio was flavorful, but more or less thimble-sized.  The Lemon Spätzle, which I had assumed was an entree portion, was well- flavored, savory, and delightful (if a bit on the oily side), but, again, literally just a taste.  It's really hard to experience a dish's true potential when you have to make 3-4 bites last for more than 10 minutes (this coming from the world's absolute slowest eater). If I had more money to burn on teensy-weensy tasting portions, I'd be all over this place.  But as it stands, there's nothing so marvelous (other than the peppercorn soda) that I'd need to go back for regularly.  And certainly not unless I planned on eating a 2nd meal right afterward...",0.9935,0.727,0.197,0.076,0.515382980115123
2010-09-07,2.0,"Love the concept of innovative, seasonal,  vegetarian-focused fare,  but I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that the food is way *over-salted*, and overall fell short of my expectations. The highlight of the night was our final plate;  the scallops, ginormous, tender, sweet, perfection. (At $14 for a pair they better be.)  The accompanying potato pancake was also delicious, but very salty.  Also among the very salty, and less than stellar items: *corn pudding--boyfriend enjoyed it, rich for my taste. *pain perdu and grilled aspargus-pain perdu was yummy insofar as it was doused in butter, as well as salt.   *trio of onion soup--can forgive it for being salty, as what onion soup isn't. The toasted bread on top which disintegrated as eating it was toothsome, but i could've done without the feta on it. (Do we really need yet another salty condiment?). *""forbidden black rice""--it was swimming in  salsa verde and topped with cotija cheese. Unfortunately for me the salsa verde overpowered the taste of everything else, and the rice, cooked in a soupy manner itself, could've been beans, I really couldn't pick out a unique texture or flavor which I had hoped for. I did like the cheese though.   The Grilled Heart of Palm salad was one of the less salty items that we started with. The heart of palm itself was creamy, almost buttery. I would've liked more of it as well as the promised macadamia nuts (there was probably one nut, chopped and strewn through the salad.) Most of the plate was the ""Osaka greens"" which were remeniscent of the flavor of arugula but with a woody texture--I think some more lettuce would've complemented the flavor profile more.  One final gripe, the butter brought out with the bread was ice cold, as if it had just been taken out of the fridge.  On a positive note, GZ offers some innovative drinks including non-alcoholic ones infused with fresh herbs. I started the meal with the grapefruit mint cooler, it was refreshing and just the right amount of sweet and sour.  I'd like to think that perhaps on another night I would be genuinely wowed at Green Zebra--maybe I just picked the wrong things, or should have gone for the tasting menu.

If I had been drunk, I would have licked the plates.  The fettucine and the duck egg came out together. The fettucine was the favorite of the evening. The sauce was good enough to eat like soup. The duck egg was served over these amazing mashed potatoes that I couldn't get enough off. The egg... well, it was an egg. Not like what I fried up this morning for breakfast or anything, but it had a normal egg texture and a yolk that oozed out when poked. I don't know what I was expecting. We probably shouldn't have gobbled up so much of the potatoes right away. We found that the most delicious way to eat the egg was to dip the little toast points in it. mmmhmm.

I like their filtered sparkling water and I like the concept of the place.  I guess the main reason I'm only giving it three stars is because my boyfriend took me there on my birthday last year and the service wasn't so great and the food was a mixed bag and it just seemed like when you paid three hundred bucks for a meal for two there shouldn't be any weak spots.  I felt like I spent half the time apologizing and explaining that it really was better when I had been there before.  They had the most amazing creamy leek soup though.",0.9881,0.812,0.143,0.045,0.5691203703703703

I don't ask for the world but I feel this is a very simple request. The maître d'/bartender seemed unable to grasp the concept that people actually inside the restaurant are far more valuable than ""phantoms"" that make reservations only to cancel them later.

Her explanation for the policy was incomprehensible since she was incapable of anything beyond primitive muttering. I was so put off by her attitude that I normally would've walked out except for the fact we were told good things about this joint prior to entering. She was completely useless. As for the food itself, I was disappointed overall. Most of their cuisine was overly salted. The sun-choked ravioli was awful and definitely needed the Heimlich Maneuver. I should probably be grateful the portions were small. Thankfully, they offered all you can eat bread. While the presentation of entrees was artful, taste buds would call it finger-painting at best. Desert was easily the highlight of the meal and not just because it meant I could exit this den of arrogance. The carrot cake dome was a pleasant surprise. I would recommend Green Zebra as a desert place only and even that's a mild stretch.

2010-07-27,5.0,"I've been here two more times (once for the tasting menu, once for brunch) since my first review and let me tell you, Green Zebra does not disappoint. The tasting menu and wine pairing is a special occasion kinda thing. (For me anyway. Unfortunately I can't drop $275 on dinner every day. ) The waiter was very helpful and explained each dish. He and the chef allowed me to substitute a beet dish for something else, which earned them instant points in my book, as I find beets taste like freshly mowed grass. Each dish was both lovely and tasty. Hot and Sour Broth with udon noodles, baby bok choy, and spring garlic. Farm Egg Ravioli with white asparagus, morels, and sorrel. Um...yum! You leave feeling very pampered, satisfied (not bloated) but slightly overserved as far as the wine pairing. (Plan on getting a cab.)

Green Zebra is a foodie restaurant without the meat. My few meals there have been very good, with some excellent dishes and a few a bit flat or salty. A vegetarian shepherd's pie (probably winter fare only) was perfect. Service and ambiance are solid, as is the alcohol selection. You could spend it up here but also get out for $40 a head and not be hungry or dissatisfied. If you are a vegetarian, you absolutely must try Green Zebra once.

2010-07-21,4.0,"Thank god for Groupon, right? My boyfriend bought the Groupon after hearing about the awesomeness that is the Green Zebra. We put off going over and over again, me, not very familiar with the place other than knowing it was pretty fancy. Finally we picked a good night to go, and W-O-W I am glad we did. Now, we're regulars at Taco Bell, so this experience was completely out of our element. We each got a glass of wine and after being thoroughly confused by the menu, our server guided us through and we each chose three different courses. I recommend this for everyone- the portions (while they will explode in happiness in your mouth) are quite small. I am new to the vegetarian world, and both of us getting to eat things that we never imagined or would never choose to on our own was such a treat. The BEST choice of the night (by me, of course) was the poached duck egg over toast. Both of us gobbled it up like we've never eaten food before. It was...incredible. I would go back just for that dish. We got a little sample platter of ice creams for dessert, which was great. The caramel ice cream was by far the best, but a perfect little cap to our meal. So WHY not 5 stars Whitney? Why?! Well, the place is very, very small. The decor is nice and it has an upscale feel to it, but I felt like we were on a double date with the couple next to us, we were seated so uncomfortably close. In that sort of environment, especially for special occasions like anniversaries, etc. I personally want to be able to spend that portion of the evening with the person I chose to spend that meal with, not the people next to us as well. Also, the dining experience took quite a while. It was easily over two hours we were there. So, don't plan on grabbing a quick bite then catching a movie. It's kind of an all night affair.

2010-07-21,4.0,"I picked Green Zebra as a surprise dinner for my husband for our one year anniversary based solely on the stregth of reviews I'd gotten from other vegetarians. Word of mouth is that it's the height of Chicago vegetarian dining. For the most part, I would agree -- with a few caveats. I love that the restaurant is in Noble Square. This neighborhood has great affordable restos and bars but seems wholly underrated. I guess that's what keeps prices down and makes it easy for me to snag a late reservation.  The interior is upscale, minimalist, and romantic. Definitely not your crunchy hippy veggie cafe. In fact, they offer a few meatetarian items like chicken and scallops, which was weird to me. It's like when meat-centric fine dining places have a token vegetarian dish that's more of an afterthought, not made well, and probably should be left off. But it makes no sense here - even the most hardcore meat eater still eats vegetables and grains. Sigh, whatever. If this bothers you enough, I would recommend Karyn's on Green. Same vibe with 100% no meat. Ordering it is a bit confusing, since the menu categories do nothing to indicate the size of the portion. Our server was happy to explain - it's tapas-style small plates, so order 2-3 each. We got the grilled hears of palm salad (light and tasty), hush puppies (bland and forgettable), the forbidden black rice (amazing, spicy, and flavorful - best dish of the night), cremed spinach crepe (another light dish, not a ton of flavor, could use a pesto or some other sauce) and one other item that I am forgetting and so was not that memorable. This description sounds pretty hit-or-miss, but the hits were spectacular and the misses not so bad.  The cocktails made up for the miss side of things somewhat, although, in typical Chicago fashion, they busted through the $10 mark without looking back. Total with drinks and tip was around $90, so not a cheap night out by any stretch. I would recommend this place for a date - impress them with the scwank dinner then escort them down the block to the Chipp Inn and hit up $2 beer specials.

2010-07-11,4.0,"4.5 I would've given 5 stars, but some of the dishes that my friend got were just O-K.  My friend and I got 3 dishes each, so yes, the bill definitely added up, but luckily, I got a $40 coupon from groupon! So the bill came out to be around $26 :)  Very fresh, chic, cleaaan decor (white, green, yellow, hints of black). I ordered the trio of onion soup which was sooooooooo good. The bread in the soup was perfect! It was covered in goat cheese and drenched in the onion soup, so it easily broke down with a touch of my spoon. I also ordered the sweet corn ravioli which had an explosive effect when I put it in my mouth. The inside of the ravioli is actually liquid of awesome flavor, so yeah, it literally explodes in your mouth :) Anddd lastly I ordered the fingerling potato pancake topped with aioli. It was good, but nothing compared to the other two dishes. My friend ordered the werp farm baby lettuce..... which you should NEVER order. lol. Seriously, $8 for the smallest plate of flavorless greens? She also got the slow roasted shittake mushrooms, crispy potato, & savoy cabbage, which looked great, but tasted O-K. Her last dish, the roasted fingerling flatbread, was fantastic! It was basically pizza wearing fancy pants, but it tasted fantastic.

2010-07-09,3.0,"My sister (the Vegetarian) and I went to Green Zebra for Dinner on Saturday night last week, prompted into fiiiiinally going by the Groupon my sister had purchased (I think the deal was you could buy a $40 gift certificate for $20).  We were seated immediately (we had a reservation, which I'd strongly encourage...there's really no area to even wait for a table). The interior of the restaurant is really gorgeous and very fitting for the menu. The clientelle was diverse, from hipsters to baby boomers. I should preface my review of the food by saying that I have been meaning to go to Green Zebra for quite some time. It's steps from my house and I really like the IDEA of having a fine restaurant of this callibur that is all-vegetarian (almost all...one pescatarian option was available). Further, I should mention that I'm a meat and potatoes kinda gal, though I've gone veg in the past and can share my sister's perspective as well.  First, our server was very nice and the service was great and well-paced (there was only one breif lag). Two caveats: 1) I noticed that he told the table seated next to us after we had already ordered that the starred items on the menu were ""not vegan but could be made vegan if requested"" though the menu seemed to suggested that they WERE vegan. Why didn't he tell us this? What if my sister was vegan? (she's not) Were our plump physiques a cue to the waiter that his speil on the use of non-vegan ingredients in certain dishes would not be of interest to us? Am I nit-picking?  2) Here's something that ISN'T nitpicking: we were sitting right by the bar and the bartendress had long and fine blonde hair that was positively all over the place. I recall thinking ever-so-fleetingly that it seemed like a bit of a health code violation. (You know what the say about food at the finest restaurants being touched by the most hands, etc.) Well sure enough, the Sasparilla I ordered showed up with a long blonde hair coiled,wet and plastered on the inner rim of the glass. Luckily, I'm not a prude about such things, so I swiftly removed the offending strand and drank my beverage with a straw. Is it passive aggressive of me to point this out only after the fact via Yelp? Probably, but it happened and I can't just not mention it! Watch out for Rapunzel the bar maid.  On to the food: my sister went for the Chef's tasting menu (prix fixe) and I ventured out on my own. The dishes are teeny-tiny but the flavors are very strong. I'd definitely suggest 3 dishes and maybe a side or dessert. Of all the dishes we had (we both tried each other's as well) I most enjoyed the Grilled Heart of Palm, Roasted Beet Carpaccio and the dessert (a modernist take on a PB&J). Overall though, everything was just very BRINEY (save for the dessert), and as an avid consumer of olives and all things pickled, that can be good...but I don't want my whole dinner to be just one big brine-fest. I think it was the soups that did it (trio of onion and an asian soup that was on my sister's tasting menu) but all of the dishes definitely leaned toward the acidic. I was happy to order the side of Hush Puppies to hopefully temper the acid, but they were just sooo dense and blah, I couldn't choke them down.  So I have mixed feelings. The meal was certainly not to my liking, but I did have a nice time hanging out with my sister. She really enjoyed the meal, but I think mostly because of the great variety of choices at such a fine dining type of establishment. If pressed, I'm sure she'd much prefer to go to Chicago Diner.",0.9976,0.817,0.147,0.036,0.50705893521683

I usually choose one light and two medium dishes. The food is very, very good. I think the menu is creatively designed and well prepared, although, every time we've dined at GZ we have found one dish to be way over salted. It's easy to forgive their occasionally heavy salting hand though, because everything else has been awesome.  The service has always been good, but our last visit was superb. Our server was so nice and extremely polished. It was our friends' first time to GZ and she made a fantastic first impression. I don't recall her name, but she was a pretty brunette with bangs.

I tried justifying this by telling myself that as a meat-eater, perhaps my expecations were on a different scale, but I really don't think that was the case.  I guess I just figured that since everyone raves about Green Zebra doing all these great specialty vegetarian dishes, it had to be awesome. And instead, it was just better than okay. First course - beet & goat cheese terrine (quite good!), cauliflower pot de creme (eh - just tasted like cauliflower puree to me, nothing special about it). Second course: some asparagus and savory french toast thing, that was so heavy on the buerre blanc that the whole dish tasted like butter to me (I didn't even finish this one) and a trio of french onion soup (quite yummy, but nothing special) Third course:  A mushroom and grits dish with hush puppies(delicious grits, and my favorite of the night, but the hush puppies were a bit dry) and hot and sour broth with udon noodles (good). Dessert:  On the recommendation of the busser, we ordered the pave with peanuts, caramel, sea salt.  This was the star of the meal, for sure.  Yum.   So good food, though not as creative and flavorful as I had hoped, at least for the price.  Glad we went, but probably won't be back.",0.9971,0.749,0.231,0.019,0.5028880070546736

We were offered a cold black-eyed pea salad as an amuse-bouche.  I'm not usually a  BEP fan, but I wish I had that recipe for next New Year's Day.    I settled on the three-onion soup, which came with a giant cheese coated crouton which was delicious.   As a main, I selected the lemon spaetzle which had a dollop of carrot foam on top.  Glad I watch Top Chef or I might have been alarmed by that.    It was lemony, filling and delicious.  Three good qualities in a veg restaurant.  I also had a side of hush puppies which looked strangely like donuts, but had a good savory, cheesy taste and were plentiful.  Other non-veg diners had the spinach omelet, the poached egg and the beet salad and were very happy.   A friend even ordered the soup after seeing mine.  The dessert menu was surprisingly vast.  I ordered the rosewater marshmallows, which were slightly disappointing, but I tasted the brownie which was delicious and the chocolate pave was quickly devoured.  The prices were decent ( My food alone was $35)  but I could tell that thought and effort went into the menu and everyone was challenged and satisfied. It was the highest level of vegetarian cuisine that I've experienced so far.  After all, it wasn't just a sliced tomato on a plate.   Service was sufficient, not outstanding.   Everything was just good enough, portions, prices, and flavors,  that I'll change my mind and say I will happily return with my veg friend or go  there with someone who thinks it's a granola-place that's all about salads.  They will be surprised.",0.9981,0.728,0.226,0.046,0.5922575757575758

As for the food, it was just ok.  I was glad to see ramps and fiddleheads on the menu, especially since I have never tried the latter.  The ramps were buried in the onion soup, you couldn't taste any of that great muskiness of Chicago's namesake.  The fiddleheads were good, tasting rather like asparagus, but the dish they were in was otherwise bland.  Maybe these ingredients weren't intended to be the centers of their dishes, but the chef did not do a good job of highlighting the flavors.  I also got the fried chickpea dish, which did not sound like it was going to be felafel, but it was, and not very good. I knew beforehand  that GZ was a 'cheesehole' place, i.e. vegetarian and not vegan, and there were a number of vegan-friendly options.  However there were a few things on the menu, like the sunchoke ravioli for example, that could have easily been made vegan but weren't.  It just seems like they are doing the same thing to vegans that omnivores do to vegetarians, ironically.  And don;t get me started on the total lack of vegan desserts.

My dad and step mom got the rhubarb german pancakes, which were also delicious!  Neither of them needed syrup.  I'm sure it helps that we are all kind of in love with rhubarb, but those pancakes were great (I tried some).  Our cousins got a frisee salad with egg and eggs benedict.  They seemed quite pleased with both.

2010-04-20,3.0,"I went here last night for an anniversary dinner and wasn't so impressed. First of all - Green Zebra is not vegetarian. It might be mostly vegetarian but they serve seafood.  Atmosphere: Minimalist, modern, earthy, nice lighting. Warning - if you don't like the possibility of being seated six inches away from other diners - avoid this restaurant. If you're not seated in one of the comfy booths that line the wall, you're pretty much going to be on someone else's date unless your group is big enough to warrant your own section.  Service: Extremely good. From the guy that kept refilling our water to the waiter that was extremely attentive. The only negative is that after we got home we realized we ordered an additional dish, were charged for it and never got it - annoying to say that least - especially at $12 a pop.  Food. This is where I was most disappointed. First of all, the vegan-friendly dishes (labeled with a ""v"" next to them on the menu) weren't as plentiful as I would have liked - this especially goes for the entree-like section and the desserts.  We started out with a trio of onion soup (included ramps!). It was basically like the broth of french onion soup. It had a nice grilled piece of bread in it. It was just ok for me.  Next we had the shittake springrolls. These were pretty good but not really something I would crave.  I was really excited for our next plate - the black eyed peas dumpling but the inside of the dumpling didn't impress - it reminded me of simple red bean paste. The BBQ was more like terriyaki sauce and was pretty bland.  Next was the fried chickpea plate which was basically just falafel squares. They were very dry and very run-of-the-mill for me.  The final plate was the crowning achievement of the night - the Udon noodles. I enjoyed trying fiddlesticks for the first time (they reminded me of broccoli stems in flavor and texture) but the real highlight was the broth - a very delicious ponzu/citrus style broth that I couldn't stop eating.  The dessert menu didn't offer anything that was vegan that was exciting to us so we decided to pass.  All in all, I think the restaurant is fairly overpriced and I was annoyed that they call themselves vegetarian and also that a dish was skipped.

For many, including myself, dining at Green Zebra is a splurge to say the least, but the brunch menu is a bit more wallet friendly.  Per usual I checked out the menu before arriving and settled on the German pancake, but as the menu is seasonal they now paired the pancake with fig instead of the caramelized apple I drooled over. Since I'm not wild about fig, I went with the crepe served with passion fruit curd, dark chocolate and creme fraiche with a side of the GZ potatoes. Before our meals arrived we also received complimentary corn bread madeleines; they were amazing! My meal was very good, but if I'm being totally honest it was also overpriced. For $3.50 the small side of simply seasoned fingerling potatoes seemed a bit much. Also at $11, my single crepe seemed extremely overpriced for something relatively pedestrian; if the chef poured his blood, sweat and tears into the passion fruit curd, I wasn't feeling it. From a portion standpoint it also seemed overpriced; a similarly priced dish of french toast was a mountain of food, easily 3x the size of my meal!  The space is sleek and minimalist; very relaxing. We never felt rushed, even as the brunch crowd had pretty much moved on. I just felt like $22 (including tax and tip) for one crepe, a few potatoes and iced tea was a bit excessive.

Upon the plane landing (also known as walking through the doors), the years of hype I had built into my mind proved to actually be slightly underinflated.  The décor of the jungle wasn't as fancy as I expected it to be - I was actually overdressed wearing black socks and dress shoes while the others on the safari wore jeans - but it is still a sleek, classy place all the way.   That being said, the environs still maintained a slightly savage hipster Ukrainian Village edge (despite being in Noble Square).  The music the guides played for us was an indie rocker's dream for the most part and (much to the metaphorical flair of this review) they even played some of the quasi Afro-beat of Vampire Weekend! But this is one of those safaris that is worth it for the tastes as much as the sights.  My eyes glazed over with the entirety of the menu my oyster (mixed metaphor warning!).  There are all the popular brunch standbys with a vegetarian twist from eggs benedict to a breakfast burrito to a veggie monte cristo (although, in general, fake meat was not to be found). I went a little bit to the lunch side of brunch and got grilled cheese and tomato soup (it seemed to match the weather outside).  The tomato soup was a little iffy.  If they were going for tasting smoky, they missed the mark and went straight to (in the immortal words of Ralph Wiggum) tasting ""like burning!""  But, oh my goodness the grilled cheese was not your mama's standard American fare!  It was an exotic, gooey, buttery, perfectly toasted, French white-cheese masterpiece!  I got a side of the most amazing cheesy, large-portioned, reasonable priced, flavorful grits I've ever had as well. In a way, I feel a bit taken, though.  The brunch menu ranges from about $7 to $15 an entrée.  The food, however, was so alluringly decadent that I find myself now desperately wanting to try their (cost prohibitive, even with a recently purchased Groupon) dinner menu.  Man, that's how these tour groups and safaris get you, I swear!  Curses to the Green Zebra!  Gazing on its wonder once has made me want to spot it again and again!",0.9934,0.835,0.127,0.039,0.4338636363636364

I LOVED THIS DISH and could have eaten five of them. Fresh Burrata Cheese, satsuma tangerines, salted cucumbers, pumpernickel - Perfect combination of well-seasoned and fresh ingredients on a beautifully arranged plate. Chef's selection of desserts - I hope the chef did not select my four dessert samples because they were not special. Save yourself some sugar calories and eat another savory dish instead.

We went here for the Chef's Week Menu, and like some of the other reviews stated, the food was WAY too salty. My ravioli dish with mushrooms was so salty that I couldn't eat it. Veggies have enough flavor without having to salt them to death. As for the dessert, the carrot cake dome was good, but it was still frozen in the middle.  Oh well. The wine list was pretty small, too.",0.8481,0.851,0.125,0.024,0.47500000000000003

2010-03-25,1.0,"This review has nothing to do with the food but rather some very questionable service that my friends and I encountered last Sunday at brunch. I could gripe about how our coffee was never refilled (not-a-once), or that our amuse bouche and appetizer plates were never cleared, but I won't because what I am most concerned with is that our final bill reflected prices that were $.50 to $1.50 more than what they were listed as on the menu. Luckily, a member of our party was astute enough to realize that we were being overcharged on the final bill. When we brought this to the attention of the staff, they seemed indifferent and sluggishly brought it back for review. They made no attempt to bring the menu back out, so that we could cross-reference the prices ourselves; transparency be damned. As the bill was generated by their computer, I was concerned that everyone in the restaurant was also going to be overcharged and felt like I should have made some sort of announcement, like, ""Hey, check your bills because they're overcharging."" After 15 minutes without any communication from the staff, our server, unapologetic, brought the revised bill to our table.  The whole thing felt like some sort of scam. When a restaurant's staff doesn't apologize for overcharging their customers and doesn't  allow the patrons to review the menu, one automatically assumes that they are involved in some sort of nefarious scheme. I really have no desire to go back and interact with such a lackluster staff, and I don't care how good the truffle, Parmesan fries are.",0.2567,0.796,0.099,0.105,0.5

I absolutely loved the slow roasted shittake mushrooms ! They are wrapped in potatoes, and basically amazing. The scallops are the only non-vegetarian thing on the menu, and were also delicious. I was disappointed there were only two of them though, since I was sharing with my boyfriend.. Overall really pleased with this place and I would go back !

We considered getting the tasting menu, but after the waiter described it we opted instead for the ala carte. We each ordered 3 dishes: - Burrata cheese -- outstanding, this was my favorite. Great mix of creaminess, acidity, sweetness and crunch. Definitely going to try this at home. - Grits with sweet red peppers -- second favorite, the grits were creamy and the peppers added just the right sweet tang - Sunchoke ravioli -- my date got this, she loved it. I had a bite and it seemed pretty good but I didn't get to fully taste - Sweet potato-coconut soup -- very good, not incredibly different from other stuff I've had but tasted great - Egg salad on brioche -- not incredibly different , but well executed, bread and egg salad were great - BBQ black-eyed pea dumplings -- good, but I wouldn't say amazing. I'd probably try something else next time, but probably good if you're a vegan Also got the Bees Knees cocktail ($12) which was awesome, and the homemade root beer ($6) which was very good as well.

As others have said, the food is fresh and has a full menu of great vegetarian food. We listened to the waiter and the people sitting around us and each ordered 3-4 dishes. We left feeling full (but not in a gross way, in the perfect happy way). The standout dish was a special soup they had. It was a butternut squash thai soup that was spicy, savory and incredible. Lee recommends that a ""hungry guy"" would be full by ordering 4 dishes.  I also loved a beet salad that we got, so fresh and pretty!

The wine selection was ok a lot of people who seemed like they were on a first date.

I am not a vegetarian, but I do have an appreciation for good vegetarian food. The decor is nice, but there isn't much that absorbs sound so it is pretty loud. At least they aren't playing loud background music to make it worse. I loved the silver ware. I'm a dork, I know, I'll admit it. The waitress told us we should order 3-4 plates per each, but looking at the prices, we decided that it just wasn't feasible. So we settled on three plates for the two of us, thinking we would order more if we needed to. After ordering we had to wait awhile for water and then even a bit longer for bread. Of which we received one piece each. Seriously? Bread rationing? Are you having a bread shortage? And the butter was rock hard, making it almost impossible to spread on our precious single slice. Finally our first dish arrived. It was a hearts of palm salad with satsuma slices, some sort of greens, crushed macadamia nuts, and avocado. Delicious. The flavors and textures blended together perfectly, and we literally scraped the plate clean. As we waited for the next round, we saw the ""Bread Guy"" give everyone else in the entire restaurant bread except us. We must have stared at him enough that he finally noticed and came to our table, and gave us TWO MORE pieces of bread! Man, I hope we didn't make them run out... The last two dishes were brought out together. Two sea scallops with mushrooms and microscopic chunks of yukon potato in a pomegranate sauce. Everything tasted great -the scallops were perfectly seared and the sauce was incredible. I just didn't know why the 6 bits of potato were cut into 1 cm x 1 cm squares. If you are having a potato shortage as well, we can do without. The last dish was spinach crepes (Creamed Spinach Filled Crepe, oyster mushrooms, confit artichoke, parmesan). Super tasty as well, the crepes were fluffy which I enjoyed. We then decided we were pretty full, but could get down some dessert. I had the orange creme puffs, and she had the apple fritters. Compared to the main dishes, these were lackluster. The puffs were average, and the apple fritters could have come from a semi-classy carnival. Overall, the main dishes tasted amazing. The service could have been a little better (although our waitress was very nice) and the desserts need some work. Plus the prices are sort of outrageous for the size of the plates - bigger than some tapas, but still relatively small.

2010-03-15,5.0,"Green Zebra is run by the same people who created Spring, and it is just as good. Like Spring, it focuses on fresh, local ingredients, but the vast majority of the menu here is vegetarian or vegan. Yeah, they have a nominal fish or chicken dish, but if you're coming to Green Zebra that's not what you want to get. The reason one comes to Green Zebra is the impressively delicious, creative full-menu of vegetarian cuisine. It's nice to see what vegetarian eating can be at the height of brilliance here, since when I think of myself as vegetarian I envision the sad picture of a nutritionally deprived woman eating nothing but pasta with marinara and blocks of cheese. My mom, brother, and I are all carnivores, but all of us really liked Green Zebra.

Since it was my date and I's first time, our waitress explained to us that the plates were small and that it was best to order about 3 per person. We took her advice and picked a couple of things from each portion of the menu. We also each chose a cocktail--the Bees Knees and Tequila Snowstorm--both were fantastic, although I think the Bees Knees was slightly superior. Some of the highlights of our meal: Mu shu wraps (my date's favorite), shiitake mushroom rolls (my favorite), thai coconut soup, creamed spinach crepe (incredibly delicious and a filling last course). I agree that it is a little bit pricey, but I'm a sucker for small plates as I love to try lots of things and share with my date. I read a couple of reviews that complained about the service, but I thought the service was honestly impeccable. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive.  The only part of the meal I was disappointed with was the dessert. My date doesn't do dairy, so we went with a vegan option--the pear strudel. It was only ok, and just confirmed my belief that dairy belongs in dessert.  Overall a delicious and satisfying meal, even though I love meat!

2010-03-09,4.0,"Green Zebra is a slap in the face to American culture. It says, ""Hey, America, you don't need to make a slab of meat the center of every nice meal, you don't need to add bacon fat or duck fat to everything to make it taste good, and you definitely don't need to eat as much as you do."" On the other hand, I think it should be known before you come here that this is a small plates, big flavor kind of place. It seems as though the menu changes rapidly according to season, as the ""seasonal menu"" online didn't match the menu we were given in the restaurant. The atmosphere itself is swanky, sleek, sexy, and I think could accommodate a group, or an intimate date equally well.  The Rootbeer in the Rye, which featured Old Overholt Rye Whiskey in combination with a sarsaparilla simple syrup. If it was any sweeter, it would have been a liquefied RootBeer DumDum pop. Luckily it wasn't, and I could still savor the Overholt, which was a great pairing for the sarsaparilla. The Bubblegum Pear Salad was good, but there was nothing substantial about it. Thinly sliced pieces of pair were placed over flavorful greens, herbs. I'd probably pick a different salad next time. Sunchoke ravioli was great, fresh semolina encasing, and a very flavorful puree inside. A singe quail egg, perfectly poached and placed over it, was a great pairing for the dish.  I'd definitely come back here, but it would be hard to justify coming frequently if you're on a student budget.

After my second visit, I was thinking that maybe they had an off night, or that possibly, I ordered wrong.  The food was good, but nothing was outstanding or memorable.  Service was attentive, but nothing above or beyond.  We still had a good time, and I was looking forward to my next visit, when things would hopefully be awesome again.  After my third visit, I can say that I am in no hurry to go back.  I like what they're doing at Green Zebra, but I liked it better when it didn't feel like they were just going through the motions.  On this last visit, it was obnoxiously loud inside.  Maybe its not fair to review a restaurant based on who goes there, but when I want to have a nice dinner with my husband, I don't want to have to shout to be heard.   Our server got the job done, but seemed like he would rather be somewhere else, and it showed.  Some dishes were dropped off with no explanation at all, and when I am eating somewhere that charges $15 for a bite of foamed whatever atop a fusion of something else, I'd like to be reminded about what went into the dish.

2010-02-21,5.0,"I'll start my review by saying that I am a vegetarian. I'm happy to eat at many non-veg restaurants, as I am not very picky about what I eat. However, when I eat at a vegetarian restaurant, it's a treat because I have so many options to choose from. My fiance and I frequent places like Handlebar and The Chicago Diner, but nothing tops Green Zebra. Don't get me wrong, the aforementioned are totally awesome, but they are casual and focus more on meat substitutes like seitan whereas Green Zebra focuses on the seasonally fresh produce. I have eaten here many times since it's opened for various occasions (birthday, valentine's day, and most recently my fiance's birthday on NYE), and every time is a new adventure. We prefer to do the chef's course with wine pairings, because the meal ends up being an adventure with the perfect wine compliments. I will say that Green Zebra is a special occasion restaurant for us, because it is pricey. We usually spend close to $300 (with drinks) when we eat here. The service has always been top notch and the staff actually welcomed us to toast in the New Year with them on our last visit. It was a lot of fun. For folks who lament that this is not like (or as cheap as) veggie diner, it's a totally different concept. Food is art at Green Zebra and the experience is worth the extra money.

I'm a cheap vegetarian and she's a foodie omnivore, so we figured we both had something to entice us as well as something we were hesitant about. Our reception was a bit offputting  - we didn't have a reservation, on a Monday night, and were given a bit of the ""Oh, no reservation? Tsk tsk...we're awfully busy and you really should've thought ahead"" runaround for a minute or two before the hostess acknowledged that in fact, there were multiple tables for two open. Not sure what the point of that was, unless to make us feel somehow merciful for a table. (To be fair, this was only a hostess thing - our waiter was charming, if a little absent.) The food was generally pretty good; not great, but decent. I appreciate any restaurant that makes vegetarian food that's not just an attempt to recapitulate meat-having dishes. (I'm looking at you, portobello mushroom ""burgers"".) Our waiter appropriately warned us that the dishes are more tapas-sized than full meals - expect to order 2 or 3 things off the menu. I think I came out slightly ahead of my dining companion: my ravioli was a very good combo of flavors and my fig and mushroom cream soup was smooth and somehow soothing. Her BBQ dumplings weren't quite up to snuff, though her brussel sprouts side dish made us both reconsider brussel sprouts as a legitimate vegetable option (our 9 year-old selves were totally wrong about them). The hush puppies with (7 year!) cheddar cheese were good, though the cheese didn't really add anything except expense-adding Fanciness.  So yes.

Let's have a frank discussion here folks.  This is vegetables.  I am not knocking that at all.  My partner is vegetarian, and I eat mostly vegetarian food.  But no vegetarian meal, no matter how well crafted should cost so much considering the portion you receive.   We opted for the tasting menu & NON-alcoholic drink pairs, which was supposed to be 5 courses, but ended up only being 4.  If they are counting the ""Amuse-bouche"" (theirs was a piece of bread with a side of applesauce) as a course, that is a flipping ripoff.  Of the 4 courses, I think only the dessert wasn't loaded with fennel.  I love fennel, but if you are going to serve me 3 dishes heavy on fennel, you should have called it the Fennel Tasting Menu.  The drink pairings were tasty and paired well except for the dessert, which was 'key lime pie' paired with hibiscus tea... Maybe I just didn't ""get it"" with that pairing.  On the positive side, the cauliflower-3-ways was amazing and I could have licked that bowl out. Will probably not return simply due to how severely overpriced everything is. 3-5 items per person are required for a proper meal.  This is a loud place so expect to have to speak up.  Also, the seating is very tight so don't be surprised if you need to ask the lady sitting at the table next to yours to move her purse for a second so you can slide into the booth.",0.9524,0.873,0.092,0.034,0.5874731789949181

Either way, we sampled a few items from the menu.  The beet and goat cheese terrine was not as good as mentioned by other yelpers. The dish was overwhelmed by the taste of vinegar.  The hoison dumplings were next - pretty good.  Like potstickers with mashed up beans inside.  Our favorites included the spinach crepe and the artichoke ravioli.  Both were done pretty well - Creamy with a good balance of flavors. One thing I think is important that wasn't mentioned by other Yelpers is that as soon as we were greeted by a waitress, she mentioned that it was recommended to order 4-5 dishes per person.  At an average price of $12/dish, things can get pretty expensive here.  Especially if you tack on a few drinks or a bottle of wine.  Portions are pretty small, so if you have a big appetite, be prepared to order even more dishes than recommended. So I guess the take away from my review is go into the experience expecting to shell out a lot of money and to savor the small plates you are served.",0.9653,0.854,0.111,0.034,0.5159786641929499

I swear that if you ate that salad in the dark and didn't know what was in it, you couldn't figure it out.  Its a must try.  The bubble gum salad is also a fun way to start the meal- you'll be talking about that pear the next day.   My must haves on the hot side are the Rye Spatzle, Black Rice, and the Black Eyed Pea Dumpling (I gotta feeling....Wooo Hoo!.....

I am a little frustrated with some of the reviews posted for this restaurant- clearly these people just don't get ""it"".  I recommend that you know what you are in store for before you come to the GZ, or any experiential concept restaurant for that matter, so that you can give the place, people and the menu the respect it deserves.   Go with friends, start with a specialty cocktail, get a salad, and order many plates and share them all.  Most importantly, make sure you get a little of each element of the dish on your fork- the effect of the combination is where the real genius lies.",0.9921,0.754,0.175,0.071,0.5384920634920635

I have been searching for a ""savory"" dessert as good as the one I had years ago at L&M in Oxford and this cake was close but not quite there.  Still, I would and plan to go back soon to try some of Chef Molly Harrison's other creations.  At the end of dinner, our total was less than $100 (with another $40 taken off thanks to a Groupon I bought a few weeks ago), so for the price, this meal was at least 4 out of 5 stars.

I was especially blown away by the fresh pasta with mushroom and all of the spices that are usually in Italian sausage. I also love, love, loved the dessert. Fig beingets with a delightful ice cream accompaniment. Drink: 6 Stars at least!! We opted for the non-alcoholic pairings which included fresh made sodas and teas ranging from pink peppercorn and thyme, to house made rootbeer, to an herbal chai teas with the equally amazing dessert course. Decor: 5 Stars, I even mentioned that I have been thinking about painting my apartment the exact color of the dining room. It is sleek and classy without being pretentious and overdone. Service: This was really the downfall of my experience. I would rate it at about 2.5-3 stars. When spending this kind of money on a vegetarian meal in which each course involves preparations I have never experienced before the service needs to be on par. They had one waiter for the entire restaurant, as well as a host who also seemed to be the bartender, and fill in waiter at times. Not once did our drink pairings arrive at the same time as the dish. Also several times we saw the food runner come out with a tray containing our food and set it 6 feet from our table so we could watch it get cold while the waiter was chatting it up on the other side of the dining room. I think the food runner noticed how long it was sitting because a couple of times he brought it himself but set it down with no explanation. Finally the waiter would arrive to give us the lowdown on these unique and unexpected dishes but this needed to be done in sync.

So it was worth the 100 i guess. But, next time I'll choose to spend the money elsewhere.  Now, i can see how the place gets and average of 4 stars - all of these people must have ordered the good dishes!!  I visited a few years ago and remember liking my meal, so we returned for my birthday dinner. I got the udon soup with chestnuts and veggies. it was really really good!!! He got the the thai spiced sweet potato-coconut soup. Holy shit, they make more imaginative and better spiced soup at soup bowl. and you pay a lot less for a lot more. We laughed at the two (i'm talking two TINY) rice noodles that were almost completely immersed and dissolved by the time the soup got to the table.  Next: Sunchoke ravioli, grilled leeks, medjool dates w/ lemon and quail egg. ummm, bland??? two big ravioli's and a quail egg. that had no balance flavor or texture-wise. that was a big miss.  Parsley Root Tart w/ roasted shallot, creme fraiche, parsley puree, walnut and sherry : pretty good. really rich with nice flavor, i dunno if we liked it a lot because it was actually really good or because it followed the ravioli.  Warm Braised Artichoke and Bread Salad, olives w/ preserved lemon : pretty darn good, a little salty and overcooked but i really liked it and so did the mister, hallelujah!  We had a nice bottle of wine and the service was good. The server was attentive and helpful. Where I feel like deducting stars for service are the suggestions. I don't know if this guy genuinely thought the food was stellar or if he was just going through the motions. After dessert i got the feeling he was just telling us what we wanted to hear. Not what i expect in a fine dining atmosphere. If there is an outstanding dish, tell me. If there is a better choice over what i am making, let me hear it. If the dessert i am ordering SUCKS, steer me to something else.  so, the dessert, i almost fussed about this and it almost made it a one star experience.  We ordered caramel corn with cheese. For the price and atmosphere, i am expecting artisinal corn with cheese. something obviously homemade and different tasting. I guess i was expecting yummy rich caramel corn that was still warm or something with caramelized or drizzled cheese. sounds good right?  well, we got cold stale caramel corn in a bowl. with two spoons. i have no idea where the cheese was, i didn't even taste powdered cheese. something out of a cracker jack box would've been better. let me tell you, after the irritation we laughed. like really laughed! i was going to send the thing back but the boy didn't want me to go through all that, because after all, it was my birthday dinner and at the very least we laughed.  yea, we will laugh for a lot less somewhere else next time. veggies, come on, have higher standards.  extra star for ambiance. finer dining but not at all stuffy. comfortable seating and attentive service.",0.9985,0.764,0.199,0.036,0.5181882440476191

I would come back for the Spence Farm Poached Egg, smoked potato puree, country sourdough.  As a meat eater I commented on how the smoked potato puree tasted like it had bacon in it, which was a huge plus for me.  My wife's Warm Braised Artichoke and Bread Salad, olives, preserved lemon was another dish that wasn't as well explained on the menu as it should have been.  There was an obvious Indian influence in the dish and neither of us are big Indian food/Indian curry fans.   For desert we had the ice cream tasting which consisted of chocolate malt, vanilla and lavendar, rum raisin and fennel.  One taste of the fennel ice cream and I knew what it was that put me off in the baked beans.  Fennel!

I love that the menu has tasting portions (not tapas) so that you can easily try 3 or 4 dishes per person. Believe me, with so many awesome choices, I would feel let down if I could only select one entrée.  I love that the food focuses on vegetables (not seitan, tofu and other meat substitutes).  The vegetables are the highlights of each unique dish - this is not one of the lackluster vegetarian restaurants that seeks to imitate meat dishes. Another feature that I like is that the menu changes regularly so you can always come back to try something new.  Also, the wine list is small but carefully selected to match the food and often times they even offer a prix fixe menu paired with wine. GREAT SERVICE: The service is first-class.  The waiters are very knowledgeable about the menu, check in with you when needed but not too much, and let you take your time trying all of these wonderful dishes.

2010-01-07,5.0,"Amazing. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Having somewhat recently moved to the city, I was not a fan of the Chicago restaurant scene until I discovered Green Zebra. Now I'm in heaven. I'm not a vegetarian (just veggie-friendly), but the food is simply out of this world. Seriously, I'm usually one for variety but after my first experience here, I had to come back twice within two weeks. Was fantasizing about some of the dishes! Everything on the menu is delicious, and it's small plates, so you get to sample different flavors. By now I've had most things on the menu (kinda embarrassing) and everything is great. The servers are knowledgeable, fun, and don't rush you. High quality and not exorbitantly priced wine list. I've been here with vegans and carnivores alike and they both have had rave reviews (besides, there's always one non-veggie main on the menu).",0.961,0.849,0.129,0.023,0.44758730158730153
2010-01-04,2.0,"I went here for Mother's Day 2009 with my family.  The reviews looked pretty good but the experience was horrible.  I understand that the place was busy but a restaurant is supposed to plan for these kind of busy dates with more staff to take care of their reservations and guests.  We were sat promptly at our reservation time but it took at least 30 minutes to even give our drink order.  We were explained that the dishes would take a lot of time so we should order as many as possible right away.  I was pretty blown away at the cost of each tapas plate; typically at a normal veggie restaurant you'll get stuffed for $15/entree but at Green Zebra you are expected to pay at least $30 to $50 a person and you won't even be fully satisfied.  It's a horrible waste of money and the food wasn't as good as I had expected.   They rushed taking our order but by the time we even got the tapas plates, it was at least 1 hour later.  They didn't even make up for the time we sat there starving for something to eat.  They offered each of us a glass of wine during our wait which was on the house, but they never refilled the basket of bread nor did they bring a single food item during our crazy wait.  By the time we were done with dinner which was after 10pm, our bill for 5 adults was well over $225, not including tip.  I was no impressed and will not go there again, even if someone paid for my dinner.  I'd stick to Karyn's Cooked if you need vegan fare.  At least there is more food you'll get for your dollar and you won't have to wait as long. One last thing about the ambiance; it's extremely loud and difficult to have an intimate conversation.  The tables are less than 14 inches away from each other.  This is not a place you want to break up with someone or a first or second date.",-0.4659,0.849,0.071,0.08,0.5362612612612613
2009-12-29,4.0,"This was tasty. I am not a vegetarian by any means (I love MEAT) but I came here with my vegan and vegetarian friends, and I really enjoyed it. It was nice to go somewhere that didn't struggle to serve them, as I generally sometimes drag them places that are not vegan/vegetarian super friendly.  The atmosphere is nice and relaxed; I didn't feel overly pressured to be fancy nor did I feel poor. The prices aren't terrible either, although it is suggested that you get more than one dish, so that could seem expensive for some people. However, if you are going to this restaurant, you know that you are in to spend some money, so it really shouldn't be an issue. For my food, I got a roasted beet and goat cheese terrine, which was divine and quite possibly one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life. As a beet lover, it was exciting to see it paired with goat cheese, another of my favorites. The flavor was strong in the best way possible. I also had the potato and leek soup, which was tasty, but not the best thing I've ever eaten. I also had the crepes, and I feel really awful about this, but I honestly can't remember what was in them, other than that there were mushrooms involved. They were good, but it wasn't  awe inspiring, and I was a little disappointed with my choice. For dessert, I chose the apple bismarcks with caramel and thyme ice cream and the aged cheddar. I was upset with the bismarcks because they weren't hot when they came out, and the apple inside could have been more flavorful. It was a very light taste, but it seemed as though the apples were cooked a little too long before put into the bismarck. However, the caramel and thyme ice cream was outstanding, and I would have liked to eat bowls upon bowls of it, and not just the small scoop that I got. Caramel and thyme seemed like a very strange combination, but those flavors together were like a symphony in my mouth. Very delicious. Also, aged cheddar is always a plus in my book, and so I didn't have any complaints at the end of the dessert, as the ice cream and cheese saved it. My dining companions all enjoyed their meal, although they were a bit disappointed with the way the baked beans were cooked-the flavor was good, but they didn't fully enjoy the texture of the beans, which they claimed was inconsistent and at times, too dry. I wish I could say that I tried their dishes, but I didn't really try anyone's because of the fact that they all ordered vegan and I ordered regular vegetarian, and I felt bad about trying their food when they couldn't try mine. I would go back to this place, as it is tasty, but I won't be here often. However, when I know that I have vegetarian friends that would love somewhere to eat that is directly catered to them, I will always suggest Green Zebra.",0.9986,0.716,0.219,0.064,0.5925377073906486

2009-11-19,4.0,"I wish 4.5 stars was an option! It was a Tuesday night and our four year anniversary, so we decided to choose one of the restaurants we'd been eager to try, (Green Zebra was one from our list of the many ""that's probably going to be amazing but then we can't go out the rest of the month"" restaurants that we reserve solely for special occasions).  To start, the host was friendly and accommodating both on the phone and in person, when we managed to arrive 45 minutes earlier than we had originally planned. When my boyfriend called to make the reservation, the host asked if it was to celebrate a special occasion, and then followed up this inquiry with two surprise glasses of Cava to toast our anniversary when we arrived. This attention to detail is much appreciated by us and set the tone for what turned into a very lovely evening. Our server was very knowledgeable of the both the menu and the chef's tasting menu. We were a little concerned when we first were seated only because we could tell (from peeking at our neighbor's food) that we should anticipate smaller dishes, but we weren't sure how much would be too much. He made suggestions without being pushy or too sales-driven and the back-servers were fast and courteous, never leaving a finished glass or dish to sit longer than 30 seconds. I cannot say enough great things about the service, everyone was absolutely fantastic. The food was almost as incredible. The amuse bouche was tasty and warm, a clear apple soup. My boyfriend decided to choose four items from the menu, whereas I decided to do the chef's tasting menu (I was excited, as a vegetarian, it's not often I can go to a restaurant and let the chef do their thing without the fear that the courses will include meat). We took tastes of everything so it was nice to share. I started with a brown bread with warm Canterbury cheese (I am forgetting the other ingredients) and my boyfriend tried the Fig and Blue Cheese Tart. Both were phenomenal. The tart just sort of melted in your mouth and the cheese for my starter was the perfect temperature.  Our second course was the one that was both fantastic and a little disappointing for me. My boyfriend had ordered the Thai Spiced Sweet Potato-Coconut Soup, which was absolute heaven. Rich and flavorful. By contrast, my soup was much less exciting and the only dish I did not care for. The aroma was similar to that of Pho, and although there were only a few greens and small bits in my clear broth soup, it seemed like it would have potential. Instead, it was very bland. Made me wish I had ordered some of the sweet potato-coconut soup for myself. For the third course, I had an amazing cauliflower steak. It was salty, but absolutely delicious. My boyfriend had the Sweet and Sour Eggplant Dumplings and said the dumplings were very good, but the broth again seemed to add very little to the dish.  For our main entrees, we were both pleasantly surprised. My boyfriend had selected the Rye Spatzle with stout foam. It was incredibly innovative and equally delicious. My entree included fat noodles (a kind like the noodles used in Pad See Ew) with fennel and sage seasoning, among other ingredients. Somehow it managed to taste exactly like Italian sausage (or at least, what I remember real Italian sausage to taste like). It was so, so good. For dessert, I had bread pudding, served a la mode. My boyfriend tried the apple pie, which was served a la mode as well, and with a sharp cheddar. Absolutely tasty. We left feeling satisfied, but not too full. We will absolutely be back again. I just hope the next time the soup is a little more exciting from the tasting menu because it was the only weak link in another wise completely fantastic experience.",0.9995,0.734,0.24,0.026,0.5905029642379037

2009-10-12,5.0,"12 hours after finishing dinner at Green Zebra, I am so full that I am almost revolted by the idea of breakfast. This is because I get the kind of out of town guests who demand to take me out for fabulous belated birthday dinners and then insist that we order half the menu...My life is sometimes just unbearably awful.  I've been longing to visit Green Zebra since I moved to Chicago, and it was worth the wait! (Though I hope it won't be another 14 months before I return!) From the start, the service was impeccable-- A gracious host, a friendly food runner who brought water at lightening speed, and a knowledgeable, personable, completely fabulous server named Jeremy. Attn: Green Zebra Management, this guy is really great at his job! (I went out of my way to ask his name so I could relay this message.) The interior of the restaurant is minimal, dim, and soothing. We began with a cocktail and glass of wine while waiting for our table. The Bees Knees (Gin, Lavender Honey, Lemon) was the embodiment of exactly what I want when I want a nice appertivo-- simultaneously light and complex, not too sweet, a bit refreshing. The gruner by the glass was equally pleasing.  Once the lady K and I sat down, we realized that we'd need to make a list if we were going to not just go hog-wild and order the whole menu. So, as we munched our delicious, nutty whole wheat bread we made a list of 9 dishes on the back of a receipt, to the amusement of our server I'm sure...But, I recommend this strategy if you're having too much hunger and food lust to think straight and order. (This might have been too much food for two people as we're both still really full, but we ate every last bite of everything but the Spatzle which was just too rich at the end of the meal.)  The burrata with blueberries and a little something spicy was creamy and divine, the pear salad textured and delicate...Nicely paired with a little half glass of Reisling by the amazing Jeremy! I switched to rose (nice, dry, not too much fruit) and we forged on through several more carefully paired and perfectly timed courses (The dishes emerged always two at a time, with a brief downtime between each course...perfect timing is so hard to find, and I was touched by the attention to detail.)-- carrot coconut soup, heirloom tomato salad with tiny accents of fried pickles, pumpkin seed succotash (this was the real winner, I guarantee you that I will spend the rest of the winter trying to recreate this perfect little dish), farro risotto (lemony!), garlic agnolotti (sp?) with morrocan eggplant, smoked spatzle, and an apple and onion tart with camembert which came in a close second to the succotash in terms of identifying the zenith of the meal!  This food was hearty, progressed from light to substantial, and each dish was distinct in flavor and texture. Unlike some small plates experiences where there isn't as much variation, this eating experience really reminded me of all the things I love about being a vegetarian, especially the sheer, bountiful variety of vegetables and grains and the ways they can be endlessly combined into deliciousness. There were no misses here. By the time we were ready for dessert, we were becoming hesitant. But, we ordered two desserts anyway (and were brought a third in honor of my belated birthday). Dessert was lovely, but not nearly as good as the rest of the meal. The moscato and ice cream would probably have satisfied on their own, but the lemon pralines and olive oil cake with cinnamon beignets were both tasty.  In sum, be prepared to drop some cash not because the recommended 3 dishes per diner won't fill you up, but because you'll want more. If you know anyone who is skeptical about the possibilities of a meat free diet, this is certainly the place to stage a conversion, and if you know how I can make that pumpkin seed succotash, can you please get in touch immediately?!

We sent the dish back, and the staff offered to replace it with our choice of another item from the same section of the menu.  The dish that we chose was really good, but kind of unimpressive for a fine dining restaurant (a poached egg with smoked potatoes.  Good, but unimaginative).   Before the catastrophic artichoke dish, we were already disappointed in both the service and the food.  One side dish in particular (corn on the cob elotes) was kind of a joke--basically it was half an ear of corn, blackened on a grill and with some spice sprinkled on top, for $6.00).    The other dishes ranged from good to okay, which was quite disappointing compared to past experience at this place.  The hostess and waitress were both unfriendly, although the food runners were very nice. I hope Green Zebra recovers from whatever has gone wrong with it.  I'm still a little stunned at how terrible it was tonight.  Sadly, I think we'll have to find somewhere else to go for vegetarian food on special occasions.",-0.9374,0.731,0.111,0.158,0.5967989417989418
2009-09-05,4.0,"This is the first vegan friendly restaurant that my girlfriend and I have gone to on a trip that we've liked in a long time. I would say the last place was a restaurant in San Francisco back in January. And of all places, it's in omnivore/carnivore heaven of Chicago.  Although I'm not a big fan of tapas-type portions being a chicago ex-pat, myself and also still an omnivore, the plates we chose which were all the vegan options available, was very good. From presentation to taste, it was tops and we've travelled from Seattle to San Francisco to Austin to Tucson and we've tried vegan-friendly in each city. Only a handful was good with the rest pretty bad even in our town of Los Angeles.  I would say Green Zebra is what Madeliene's Bistro here wants to be. True both restuarants prepare quite different cuisines but in terms of aspiration of environment to delectable plates to pricing, both are alike. Green Zebra, however, actually succeeds.  As with all tapas places, the plates can be a little pricey especially considering how little you're actually getting but the food is very high quality. I wouldn't recommend going often but something different once in a while that you can count on as good. Especially considering they have vegan options. The service was adequately good. Our waiter was nice but a little off insomuch at times I was wondering if he was actually listening to us during our banter or just merely being nice. For instance, on his recommendation, my girlfriend asked for a blush wine that was beautifully colored with a wonderful bouquet but the taste was rather blah to put it bluntly. I made it known to him and he apologized and went away. Okay, I thought he would make an offer to replace it, say with my choice of the pinot noir but no. Usually that's customary but not necessarily required so no biggy but ten minutes or so later he comes back and apologizes for not realizing that maybe he should offer something else in exchange. There were two other smaller instances too of this kinda not exactly all present up there in the head but nice guy and generally took care of us, just a little off. I found it amusing. Anyhow our experience is that vegan restaurants, by and far, live up to their bad reputations so when you come across a restaurant that serves good vegan, you sit up and notice. Green Zebra is one to remember especially considering it's not 100% vegan, just considerate of vegans.",0.9962,0.795,0.167,0.038,0.5334606060606061

2009-09-01,4.0,"This is a great restaurant, and like many have said. You will not miss the meat here. However, for a fine dining restaurant I am knocking off a star for the following reasons: 1. Lack of explanation/consistency. Being at a restaurant where just about every dish is extremely creative, and far from ordinary, I had no idea what I was eating. The first two courses went by, then magically at course #3, the waiter stopped by to ""review"" what I was eating. That just made me even more annoyed because I didn't know what I had ingested for the two previous courses. Then course 4 came by without an explanation either, which leads to 1a. Food runner. He could have been the one to explain dishes, or at least name them as he dropped them off in front of us. Rather, he nervously placed our dishes in front of us, and left without a single word. 2. Horrible dessert. I know this isn't always true, but the dessert I got with my 5-course tasting menu was horrendous. What I remember was a mountain of canned peaches, topped with a bland scone, and some creme fresche ice cream on the side. In size, it was bigger than all the other four courses; it taste it was the biggest disappointment of the night. We also got the ice cream tasting, which lacked horribly in presentation. Not good for those who don't like their flavors melting together. 3. Lack of ambience. In a fine dining restaurant, it is the little things that make the experience worth it. For my birthday dinner, I was seated at a table facing -- of all things -- the bathroom. Sexy... I am assuming that the rest of the dining room is ok, but I wouldn't be able to tell you. Also, my table was so oddly positioned, that neither me nor my boyfriend had enough leg room.  And back to 1a. we also had a clear view of the the location the foodrunner chose to place his tray, and were able to see how confused he seemed. Again, not something I want to see in a fine dining restaurant. Again, these are all minor things, but at these prices, these are things I expect. P.S.

Thank goodness for small plates and sharing -- I never could have just picked one or two.  * The food: Delicious! I am not a vegetarian, but I did not miss meat at this dinner.

The timing of the food was a little off, but, dining in good company and with good wine, I did not mind.  * The ambiance: The decor of this restaurant is really cool. I loved the style -- it was very relaxing.

2009-08-18,5.0,"Green Zebra is one of the finer vegetarian restaurants in Chicago, and has an absolutely incredible selection of different food options! Too often do vegetarian restaurants simply turn into temples of substitution.  Tofu becomes the currency of dishes covered in sauces that don't celebrate the vegetable, but instead simply catering to the culinary habits of the carnivorous masses. Not so at Green Zebra.  Here, the vegetable takes the main stage, and it is an absolute dream: every dish features fresh, seasonal vegetables.  I highly recommend going with one of the myriad beet dishes that are perennially on the menu.  That said, you can't really go wrong with such a varied and delicately assembled set of options. My one complaint about the food is that, at times, dishes can seem over-seasoned and too salty.  Nonetheless, this is certainly the place to go for high-quality vegetarian food. One word of advice: If you are in any type of rush, avoid ordering dessert.  Though the servers are friendly and knowledgeable, things slow drastically down between dinner and dessert and it can make a delightful meal drag on for too long (it's hard, of course, to have too much of such a great experience).  Green Zebra;s definitely worth a visit.",0.9851,0.783,0.168,0.049,0.48186801881246333

2009-07-25,5.0,"""The best food I have ever eaten in the US"" - said my dad, who is a vegetarian for the last 15 years. I saw reviews on yelp and the tapas style veggie menu sounded fun. We went to celebrate my dad's birthday at Green Zebra. Everyone else in the family is a meat/ fish lover and we were a bit skeptic about eating all veggie but still wanted to do something special for my dad and wanted him to have options. I love meat but let me tell the meat lovers out there - I did not miss my meat tonight!!! In fact this was the first time that I thought that I could live on this food forever! I just got back and given the awesome food I had to write the review immediately. I made reservation today (Saturday) at 5 pm and got a table for 9.30pm. Being Indians we are used to having a late dinner so that worked well for us. The server was great - very friendly and even though technically the kitchen closes at 10.30 - they let us order till 11.30 pm. The location of the place is not the best but the gems are always hidden. This gem does not have a name outside it either so we had to get down n make sure that this was really the place. There is no valet service but there is ample street parking so you don't really miss it. Each dish had a unique flavor and each was equally amazing - there was no distinct winner - all were amazing. The desserts were great as well. My husband had one of their Columbian coffees with dessert and said that even the coffee was note worthy. This place may not really work for a big group - I would say it is more suited for families of around 6-8 maximum. We were just 4 and still there did not seem too many table options. But the table we got was a decent location. The overall ambiance is good but can be better. Like some previous reviewer mentioned the bar is not very big and does not have bar stools but it did not matter to us as we made reservations and did not have to wait long for our table.

2009-07-15,5.0,"Though expensive (and I mean expensive, $145 w/ tip for two people, no alcohol), Green Zebra has to have been the best dining experience I've had in years. Other reviewers have mentioned the inattentive wait staff. I respect their opinions but felt that rather than inattentive, they were largely going for a more European style dining experience. In Europe, servers don't frequently return to a table after an order has been taken as it is considered rude to interrupt diners' conversations. I felt more like that was going on here, especially since the one time our server did come to check on us, she apologized for coming at an inconvenient time (it wasn't, really). The decor, as opposed to 80's or extremely hip, I felt was a moderately successful attempt at relating back to their theme and name. The restaurant is decked out in greens, browns, and stainless steel. It's supposed to be a melding of contemporary style and natural decor. Up to you how great an idea that is, but I liked it. The seating WAS a little uncomfortable, but that may just have been the fabric of my dress being a little slippery against the fabric of the booth, leading to sliding down the seat repeatedly. For me, though, Green Zebra is about the food. It's expensive. The service is good, but not what Americans expect. The decor is nice but not to everyone's tastes. These things are true of most fine dining establishments because quality and style are matters of opinion. The food, however, is amazing. Like many other patrons, it was suggested that we each order 3-4 items from the menu. If you're a heavy eater, definitely go that route and order 4 and dessert. This is what we did, but I was honestly feeling a little stuffed after. I think 2-3 and dessert would really suffice for your average person. For my meal I had the beet salad w/ goat cheese, onion and garlic soup, mushroom risotto, and fig pasta. My partner had the fresh burrata cheese, onion and garlic soup, poached egg, and gnocci. For dessert I had the ice cream tasting (fig and honey, carrot cake, blueberry swirl, and chocolate lavender) and she had the malted chocolate pudding with roasted bananas and sugar beignets. Everything (except the blueberry ice cream, but I hate blueberries so the opinion is highly biased) was fantastic.  Particularly good were the fresh burrata cheese, beet salad, onion and garlic soup, and the chocolate lavender ice cream. In these I thought the flavors played particularly well off of one another and were perfectly balanced. Everything else was still great, it's just that the first two courses set such a high bar that anything as simple as risotto was bound to fail in comparison. I would definitely focus on the top half of the menu in the future simply because those items seem to be fresher, lighter, and more flavorful. Since it was a birthday celebration for my partner and I had warned them in advance, they also sent out a serving of their sour cherry streudal with a candle with our desserts. This isn't an expensive item, but it was better than some restaurants do for birthdays, and the dish was a lovely complement to our much sweeter traditional desserts.  Also worth noting at the non-alcoholic drinks. I had the bitter lemon soda while my companion had the pink peppercorn-thyme soda. Both were amazing thought the herbal, sweet, peppery flavor of the pink peppercorn really impressed.

Popover with mushroom ragu was delicious as were the gnocchi and grits with something on it (can't remember). Yes, you can get both at an Italian restaurant, with the letter being called a fancier name of polenta, but they fit very well in the menu and weren't Italian, if you know what I mean.

I made a reservation early for Mother's Day. So, we got the one and only window seat. So far so good. The menu is not extensive but there are plenty of interesting ones to choose from. The food is served tapas style, so I was suggested to order 3-4 for each person. Since I was on budget, I thought of ordering 2 dishes each person, a dessert, and a drink. Complementing that with 3-4 slices of bread, that should really make it a full meal. See ... you just have to be smarter sometimes. =) When the food came, my jaw dropped because they were so painfully small. C'mon! I could have easily finished them in two passes. Guess what, that means more bread. The only bad thing is, they serve a slice of bread to each person. If you want more, you'd have to request it. My favorite picks are the gnocchi with porcini and cream, almond tart with creme fraiche ice cream and homemade root beer (yes, homemade). Another drink worth noting is the Il Coltivatore. This has got to be my favorite cocktail of all time. It tastes like icewine at first but there's a subtleness to it with hints of citrus and floral. I actually make them at home now.  It would have been a 3.5 but since I had some takeaways from this place, I'll bump it up to 4. Would I come back? Not if they keep the portion the size the way it is. I left with a barely full stomach but it would be so much more satisfying if they had just a tad bit more food. Just a little more to push it to the acceptable threshold.",0.9873,0.822,0.146,0.032,0.5436274509803922

They managed to put everything I love in the world on one plate and make the flavors play off of each other perfectly. If I didn't order the dates, I'd give this place four stars simply for the Poached Egg and Smoked Potato Puree. Minus one star on that one because the consistency of the puree and the texture of the bread are a little off, but the flavor is amazing and not like anything I've ever had before. We ordered other things, but nothing nearly as exciting or worth mentioning.  I definitely recommend veering away from the familiar by sticking to a couple ingredients you like and then being adventurous from there.  Ambiance and service were A+.

2009-05-30,3.0,"If I was to keep this review down to the bare minimum, I'd simply ask, ""Is the food good?"" Yes. Painfully so. Delicious in fact.  Based on that alone, I would give it a 4 star rating. However, we all know that dining is not simply about the food - well sometimes it is, but for a fancy place like Green Zebra, where you WILL spend over $100 for a meal for two, it is all but expected that everything else about the dining experience will be on par with its food quality.   That said, they get docked a star for the following: 1. Stiff atmosphere. The over-all pretentiousness doesn't help, but the atmosphere is too LA-ish and trying very hard.  I wish they'd keep it simpler, and let the food speak for itself, rather than trying to portray some kind of Beverly Hills restaurant in on Chicago Ave. 2. Loud. Most of the tables are too close together.  It was crowded, but it's a fine dining restaurant, not a ... place where people should have to yell at each other to hear each other speak.  Disclaimer: I have bad hearing. 3. For as kind as the waiter was, he was extremely inattentive.  I had an empty wine glass for like 20 minutes before he even ventured our way, and even so, I had to flag him down.  It's hard to tell who is who there, too, and the waiters seemed to constantly walk right by us without so much of a ""how are you folks doing?"" As far as the food, I was an overall fan.  I did not opt for the Chef's choice, but chose 4 dishes for myself while my date picked 3.  Oddly enough, each dish picked we picked either potatoes or asparagus in them, and most of them had mushrooms. No matter, I like all of those things, but it was a strange coincidence.   I wish I had saved room for dessert, but alas, the starchiness and heaviness of my meal (odd, considering the portion sizes and the nature of the restaurant) prevented this.  I don't know if it was just what I picked-  don't get me wrong it was all good - but I was a bit disappointed in how heavy it sat after I ate. Anyway, it's good date place, if you go a bit later or don't mind the loudness. I also feel like its a place where a lot of non-vegetarians go as some kind of novelty, and to ""prove"" to themselves that ""SEE, vegetarian food CAN be good!"" well of course it can, idiot - you didn't need to spend a day's worth of pay to prove that.",0.9657,0.811,0.116,0.073,0.5179909560723516

We had bad experience with vegetarian restaurants before where the food was not at all worth the price. Green Zebra was a pleasant surprise! We were here for the Sunday Brunch. Since we arrived about 30 minutes before they open at 10:30AM, we waited at the door and of course did not have to wait to be seated. However, the place was quickly filled up with people by the time we are about done with our meals. Jeremy ordered Challah French Toast with Peanut Butter and Banana. The french toast was extremely light in texture, along with the syrup, it was so light, it just ""puff"" and disappears in your mouth. It was a huge serving, so Jeremy was not able to finish it all. I ordered the Anson Mills Grits, southern greens, smoked mushrooms and poached eggs. It was great except they were a little heavy handed on the salt for the southern greens. Overall, the eggs balanced the salty greens and added another dimension to the grits, mushrooms were perfect. I loved it. I also ordered the Home Made Sticky Buns, which is like Cinnamon Buns, very light and just the right amount of sweetness for me!  Another one I ordered was the French Fries with Truffle Mayo, the fries themselves were good and was shoe string fries and well seasoned with salt, but the mayo might need some getting use to. I did not taste much of the truffle flavor, but something else that was kind of sour. Jeremy also ordered their Housemade Root beer. It is really more like a herb tea drink. Not at all the regular root beer, so I wanted to warn you of that. However, the taste of the root beer is refreshing and definitely will wake you up! I actually liked it. Jeremy was not too sure. It was good value for us. We think the portion was good. We think American restaurants serve too much on single serving anyways, so we think smaller portion is actually better. I understand the point of view where you are paying more for less, but the quality really was reflected by the ingredients.  Interior was simple yet elegant. I think they did a pretty good job making small intimate spaces within the large space. But, can also see this getting a little too crowded for having intimate conversations since you are sitting fairly close to your neighbors. We might be back for dinner sometime.

I had the Carmelized Endive to start.  It was the perfect mix of burnt/smokey flavor combined with sweet blood orange.  Next I had the Fingerlings which were AMAZING.  So, so very bad for you but amazing.  Then I had the Butternut Squash Ravioli which was very creamy and cooked perfectly.  By then I was stuffed, so I had some Monkey Picked Tea (supposedly hand picked by trained monkeys) which I pretty much only got because it was called Monkey Picked.  I had a cocktail with dinner also, the Red Winter, which was surprisingly pretty good.  It was a red wine base with elderflower and cinnamon.  They used dry cinnamon which kinda stuck to the glass and didn't add too much flavor, but it was a nice touch.",0.9966,0.703,0.266,0.031,0.5925287356321839

Hostesses are pretty snooty but whatever. The menu isn't huge but there are enough options.  Our server suggested that we order 4 plates each, which I think would be too much.  I ordered three and my husband ordered two and we were stuffed.  Each small plate costs $9-$17, so the bill really adds up.  I do think it's overpriced for what you get, which is basically a three to four bite small plate.  The french toast isn't really your traditional french toast and it wasn't good at all so stay away from that.   I also ordered sweet potato gnocchi but there was no gnocchi!  I think they gave me the wrong dish because it was basically a big piece of squash.  The onion cream soup was really tasty and was probably the only memorable part of our meal. The server pours it into a bowl in front of you from a cute little teapot.  The service is attentive but a bit much...someone comes by every 5 minutes to change your silverware and plates, so if you like being waited upon then you'll like this place.  Personally, I thought they were trying too hard to be upscale and kept thinking they must have a thousand dishwashers back there to keep up with all the silverware and plates that they change out.  Also, they don't really have fountain drinks so if you order a Coke, they'll bring it in a small glass bottle and charge you $5 for it.  We ended our meal with an $8 dessert (tiny chocolate tart with a thumb-size scoop of creme fraiche ice cream) which was good but nothing spectacular--and again, overpriced.  Overall it was a different experience and I was really excited to go to an all-veg restaurant, but the food ultimately disappoints.  Go and try it once, but you probably won't be able to afford it again--with our 5 small appetizer-size plates, dessert and that small bottle of Coke, the bill came out to almost $90 without tip.",0.9795,0.833,0.111,0.056,0.5514814814814814

2009-02-12,2.0,"The only reason I'm even giving Green Zebra 2 stars is because the service was good.  The best description of this place is disappointing.  As an avid diner and happy vegetarian gal, I was sadly let down by Green Zebra.  We started with the Werm Baby Lettuce Salad - it was nice; nothing fabulous yet decent.  Next on the first round was the Apple Salad minus the Horseradish.  As a non-fennel fan, I was shocked by the 'odd' taste in my mouth after my 3rd bite and then, Yep, that's fennel. A surprise I would have preferred not to have...this dish was basically shredded apple slices in a light sauce and candied hazelnuts.  Not quite worth it (and I love apples). On to the dishes - Ricotta Gnocchi tasted more like dried out hashbrowns than anything else and were without sauce combined with the fact that half of them were burnt.  The Miso Risotto had a distinct fish scent and flavor that sent my vegetarian tastebuds awry and my meat loving companion was less than excited by this dish as well. We thought we would continue to explore the menu...so we did...bad idea!  On to the chickpeas from the 'sides' menu - they smelled delicious and I was hungry (hello, everything else was awful so far).  The smell was the only delicious thing because they were downright bland and so dry to the taste that we both grabbed for our glasses of wine within seconds of biting in to them.  Next dish up - Mac N Cheese - this is an easy dish to make and they did just fine.  Would I go here for this dish? Nope - I'd hit Blue Line since it blows there's away. Last up dessert.  We were hoping for Vegan Chocolate Cake (from their website); they don't have it anymore so we opted for a chocolate tart with creme fraiche.  The creme fraiche gave a much needed distraction to the after taste left once a bite of the chocolate tart is done.

The food is nothing to write home about, nothing hearty, nothing amazing, nothing I would ever order again. One should be warned that the chefs there feel their food is an art(which is fine) and very rarely will they allow sustitutions or serve a dish sans an ingredient. While I deeply respect the art of others, on a personal level I often wish to have my meal served a certain way, with or without a certain ingredient and not being allowed to do that does not endear me to an eating establishment. Also I must warn others that the average adult would need about 3-4 dishes to create a filling meal.......leading to a very expensive bill at the end of the evening. Having not known this, we all went to the Cheesecake Factory for dessert/a snack afterwards. The Green Zebra is an expensive, trendy place.

My boy was the only vegetarian in the group, but we all love good food.  Our experience was seriously enhanced by our adorable server. She was perky and knowledgeable about the wine selection. We ordered 10 dishes to share between the four of us (they recommend 3 per person, which is an annoying over sell), plus desserts. The food came out in ""courses"" 3 or 4 dishes at a time. I liked this approach because 1) the table was  a little crowded with so many dishes and plates and 2) it gave us a chance to try everything and discuss our favorites each course.   That said, there was one very disappointing dish in each round. The mushroom rolls had zero flavor and a greasy texture. The caramelized endive salad was too sweet  and mushy(though the beets in it were good alone). And there was one other dish that was so bland I can't even recall the main ingredient. A couple things really hit it out of the park: namely the savory french toast and the stuffed dates and the french onion soup. The rest of the dishes were admirable but not stunning. The three desserts we had were a nice way to end the experience, so make sure you leave room. My only option at that point is to say that Green Zebra does well with what it has, meaning that the veggies are filling and satisfying for meat-eaters and non alike, but this isn't a five-star restaurant.

I understand that cooking flavorful vegetarian food is a challenge. Every entree we ordered was lacking serious flavor complexity. The ingredients in the hawaiian heart of palm salad did not work together and overall tasted bland. The mushrooms in the chanterelle mushroom popover were surprisingly (and unfortunately), in comparison, over-salted compared to the rest of dish. The worst by far was the foraged mushroom dumplings, tofu, Thai basil, baby bok choy, with star anise broth. The star anise broth did not work with the other elements of the dish. The vegetables did not seem fresh and had their texture reminded me of a frozen vegetable mix. The dumpling dough was far too thick and did not taste pleasant with the mushrooms. The non-alcoholic beverages were tasty and the service was good, but those things do not overcompensate for the bland food.  Overall, I would not recommend this to anyone and will not go back.",-0.3105,0.873,0.058,0.069,0.5553661616161616
2009-01-18,4.0,"A Zebra of a Different Color Destination: Green Zebra. Location: Ukrainian Village, Chicago.  A study on the name. Let's explore all the different facets of green that the Zebra encompasses.  Green is: Money. Cuz you're going to need it to dine here. The portions are delicately meager but flavorful, and are most appropriate for sharing. Our waiter recommended we choose about three dishes per person, but we needed four to feel adequately satiated. The plates average at about 12 dollars each, when paired with wine you're looking at a pretty steep bill.  The color between blue and yellow. Also signifying earthy-ness or an embrace of all things natural, leading to the link between green and vegetarian. And zebras, of course. Zebras are black and white for a reason. Their stripy black and white nature helps them hide from predators by allowing them to easily blend into their arid desert climate. There's no green in the desert. This green zebra doesn't care to hide. It stands proud, a shock of fertility in the wasteland, tempting predators and flirting with death. In a vegetarian-vegan kind of way. I've gone too far. Fresh. Overall, the food is incredible. The chef knows what he's doing. There's an abundance of seasonal oeuvres made with winter root vegetables such as carnival squash tortellini and sweet potato pot stickers, which are my personal favorite. (The second time I visited Green Zebra, I had the tasting menu, which concluded with a butternut squash tartlet, and that, my friends, was simply amazing.) Thai carrot soup like a spicy hug and the honey crisp apples and horseradish a welcome burst of fresh air. The food. Go for the food. (However, I'd advise against the polenta dish and the blackberry abalone concoction from the tasting menu)  Jealous. Us. Even though we had an 8:30 reservation, the hostess shrugged and confessed that we'd have to wait until 9:30 to be seated. We gazed out at the people who were happily devouring their entrees and engaging in pleasant conversation. People with color on their cheeks and drinks in hand. This place wasn't constructed for people to wait around. No couches or perching areas to be found. Not even a stool at the bar. We were green with envy. Inexperienced. The staff. When we asked our server what his favorite dishes were, he moved closer to me, peered at my menu and read verbatim a few of the more expensive dishes. It took 20 minutes for him to uncork and pour a glass of pinot noir. The fact that we had to wait an hour for our table shows that the hostesses have a poor concept of time management and a loose grasp on table-turning etiquette.  Gullible. The clientele. We're suckers for a fabulous food. So we will wait for a table even though we have a reservation. We will settle for poor service so that tastes can run to every corner of our mouths. We will allow our conversations to be replaced by chewing and savoring. Loosening up with each bite, we sank into our seats with the pleasure of it all. Yes. We are easily taken advantage of.

The hostess said they were waiting on our table to finish dessert. I explained that it was dire that we be seated as close to on time as possible as I had put together a surprise bday party and timing was crucial. Thirty-five minutes later we still had yet to be seated, and not once were we approached, with an apology, or an explanation. On any random night this would be disappointing enough, but this night was extra special and time sensitive. I approached the hostess stand for an update. She repeated that they were waiting on our table to clear. That's when the Principle Sue Kim-Drohomyrecky asked what was going on. How an owner was not already aware of this infuriated me. I have worked at many restaurants and cannot imagine any of the Maitre D's not being on top of the reservations. That's why I was especially shocked that Sue worked as a Maitre D for Trio. With that background I would have expected a lot more. To make matters worse she said I should have brought this to her attention earlier. Really? How is it my responsibility to do her hostesses job? Also, how was I to even know who she was? I couldn't believe that she was displacing blame. She explained that the 5:30 reservations had run behind due to the weather. I was on time, despite having to battle the same elements, why was I being penalized? Anyhow, she said she would do what she could to get us out quickly.... Too bad that meant that we were seated 45 minutes late and dinner took 2 hours. By 9:30 we had only had 2 of the 8 items we ordered. We didn't leave until 10:45. By the time we go to the actual surprise party (an hour and a half late), two friends were walking out the door, and friends who got sitters saw us for 20 minutes before they had to leave.

Together we tried the gnocchi, chesnut dumplings, mushroom popover and a few other tasty dishes I can't recall. Every bite was delicious and as most standout food goes, it was the sauces that made the difference. I swear, in another life, I want to know what it is that makes a professional's aiolis so darn good. (note: using aioli here but really, any sauce at a good restaurant just kicks mine or store-bought's arse.) Service was good, not great. Never had to look very far for someone to fill the water glass or bread but the waiter checked back maybe once to inquire how the dishes were. (Since dishes came out on three different occasions, this was not ideal.) However, since I also hate hovering waiters, I was OK with this but my friends did point it out.

2008-11-25,5.0,"Best fancy veggie-focused restaurant I've been to. Yes, the servings are smaller (order two or three dishes) and more expensive, but this isn't Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag, it's gourmet food. Your taste buds will delight in it and your stomach will be very happy if you take small bites and chew slowly. The presentation is always beautiful as well. I do wish they had more dishes that were vegan by nature, but many items can be adapted to be egg- and dairy-free. Be sure to tell your server you're vegan. Each dish blends a handful of what sometimes seems to be contrasting flavours to create a multi-toned tasting experience. My favourite dish is, by far, the slow-roasted shiitake mushrooms in crispy potato with savoy cabbage. The mushrooms are full of umami tastiness and the dish is quite satisfying. It has consistently been on the menu for years, so I hope it stays for a while longer. Most items come and go with the season, so don't get too attached. Rarely are there vegan desserts, but I'm sated at that point anyway. Try one of the delicious varieties of hot tea. Brunch doesn't have as many vegan options. I do like the ""BLT"", which is made with smoked portobello mushroom strips. It's a great blend of sweet, salty and smoky. It also comes with homemade thick potato chips. If they don't have the BLT, they may have the artichoke and olive oil hummus. The cocktails are pretty tasty, but pricey. Perhaps stick to one. Even for non-vegetarians, I would highly recommend you try Green Zebra.

Everything was delicious and I cleaned every plate. By the end of the meal, I was stuffed. (My husband got a piece of pizza afterwords. I'm just saying ;) )  The wine parings were extremely generous. So much so that I left tipsy. We got a half a glass of wine with every new food item and couldn't actually even drink them fast enough. This added up to about... 4 glasses of wine? Really good wine that indeed enhanced the food, but by the time  desert came out I was a bit tired of wine in general. I actually wish I'd gotten the non-alcoholic paring.

2008-11-14,4.0,"I eat meat. I try to be conscientious about it, but I believe strongly that the world needs -more- meat eaters with a conscience, not more vegetarians. I'm putting that out there as context, not a political statement.  I like vegetarian food. My wife is a vegetarian, and we do not bring meat into our home, except for our dogs. I do all the cooking, and at this point I honestly don't miss cooking meat. In spite of this, I am generally very leary of vegetarian restaurants. I tend to find the food over thought, over wrought, gimmicky and over reliant on the fact that vegetarians need stuff they can pass off as ""normal"" to convince omnivorous friends to show up and not complain. Again, context not politics.  Green Zebra breaks all the rules. This isn't ""vegetarian"" dining, it's just meatless. My wife and I were just here for her birthday. We went for the tasting menu, we splurged on the wine pairings. Do people expect full servings of wine even with a tasting menu? Frankly, we both left a bit sloppy. I'm not going to describe each course in detail. Part of what made this fun for me was having -no- idea what was going to show up. I've never done that before, and it was exciting and fun. I'll cut to the chase: the food is outstanding. if she hadn't told me ahead of time ""we're going to a vegetarian place for a tasting menu"" I honestly never would have noticed that I hadn't eaten any meat all evening. I even ate a few things I normally wouldn't, and liked them, just because I had no time to anticipate them and get ""set up"" not to like them.  The wines were excellent.  The service was excellent. As I said the food is outrageous.  One critique, and it's a big one: ambiance. It is LOUD in this restaurant. Now, I like dim sum parlors. The ones with the push carts. I'm accustomed to eating in loud spaces. But given the aesthetic of the decorating, and the approach of the tasting menu, and the price tag at the evening's end, it was WAY too LOUD in this room. They need to incorporate some kind soft, absorbent fabric into their decor somewhere to suck up the sound. The sense of bussle, and most of the customer's lack of dressy attire put my mind in a ""nice"" dining mindset, not a ""fine"" dining mindset. And while the food more than justified the price tag, the bill was still a shock, because I'd forgotten where I was, in a sense. There is a disconnect there, that they need to resolve.  If you have never done intentional vegetarian dining before, start here. It may spoil you on everything else afterward, but at least you will always know that it can be done and done very well.  My hat is off to the chef. A truly transportive meal. My one regret? Because we did the wine pairings, I did not order a cocktail before dinner. We sat near the bar and I watched the mixologist all evening, and she clearly has mad skills and makes serious drinks. We need to go back sometime and order from the menu so that I can get a cocktail.",0.9879,0.794,0.127,0.078,0.5699612403100774
2008-11-06,4.0,"I've been very excited to visit Green Zebra, I had heard about before I moved to Chicago.  I would say it's a casual fine dining restaurant, if that makes sense, you can wear jeans or a dress.  The inside is modern, clean, elegant. Inviting and comfortable. SERVICE - Our water was constantly refilled, plates cleared, the food was hot, and our server was attentive. Unfortunately, she was chewing gum (every server knows that is not ok), and then our first course arrived simultaneously with the bread, and amuse-bouche. Our server was polite, but seemed a little bored. The busboy actually had better energy. FOOD - very good. We went through the 5 course tasting menu, and then ordered 3 more dishes on top of that. Our favorites were the Mushroom popover, which looked like beautiful cornucopia in a homemade shell. I even took a picture of it!  A cauliflower soup with cocoa cayenne foam, was incredibly delicious -earthy, tangy, great! The presentation was beautiful as well, the foam was layered on the soup with a few pieces of cabbage to make it look like a tree! So cool! Other mentionable items came from the tasting menu - the stuffed onion with apples and frisee, the abalone mushroom with tarragon and huckleberry.  BUMMERS - the squash tart. It looked like a piece of cake or a pumpkin bar, and it was sorta bland and dry. The stuff on side was ok, but kinda sweet. I stopped eating it because I didn't want to spoil my taste for dessert.  Which brings me up to the last course.... We had the dessert that came with the tasting menu and it was - ready  - fried peanut butter wontons.  It's just not something I would have expected.  It was just regular old Skippy creamy peanut butter stuffed into a little wonton and deep fried. It was weird, and seemed cheap.  After all the rich dishes we'd had, I was hoping for something more in line with the meal, either something with a bit of chocolate or perhaps citrus to cleanse our palates.   WINE - Many great choices by the glass, and variety of bottles. It wasn't the standard Chardonnay/Cabernet. I had a German Gruner Veltliner, that went well with the meal, and my BF had a really nice Pinot Gris from Oregon.

There are plenty of other good vegetarian restaurants in the city where you'll get more for your money.  But if you're not squeemish about trying some very innovative stuff and don't mind paying around $50/person then this place is worth a visit. The only other restaurant that I think would be over the top compared to this place might be the vegetarian tasting at Charlie Trotter's (it's unbelievable).  But this is pretty top notch stuff.",0.9935,0.733,0.214,0.053,0.6588374088374088
2008-09-15,3.0,"I was taken here as a birthday gift from my lovely friend Renee C. I had known about this place since it opened, and was very intrigued about the philosophy and cuisine of the place.   First impressions were: although the space was very cleanly and minimally designed, there seemed to be almost too many tables lending to a rather cramped and unintimate space that became very loud once full.  Music ranged from 70's disco to electronica which seemed out of place as well.   And, you know how when you go into a restaurant, there always seems to be a ""type"" of customer that sort of fits the look and style of the place?  This was not the case with Green Zebra.  Easily the weirdest, most diverse and odd combination of people ever.  I guess this could be considered a good thing except you had one couple that was dressed in a sort of rumpled hippie style and another that looked almost homeless it was so shockingly inappropriate. This is amongst a table of suburban moms, a group of hipsters and a beautifully coiffed and elegant Asian couple.  Huh?  So we order.  I get the pink peppercorn and thyme soda, which tasted somewhat like a spicy ginger ale. Then the Roasted Beet salad, which had a wasabi foam, and then a gnocchi dish with figs.  Finally I have dates with ricotta and coconut.  Everything was very tasty, beautifully presented, and just big enough portion-wise.  Although I do wish we had been offered more than one slice of bread as the final dish did take some time in arriving from the kitchen.   Also, after we left something I ate caused a rather unpleasant internal rumbling which carried out for the rest of the evening.  So I am a little on the fence with Green Zebra.

At the outset we were sent a round of tiny glasses of a melon-tarragon soda (not on the menu), compliments of the chef -- it was terrific. The shitake mushrooms wrapped in crispy potato and served with cabbage were astounding; the shitake foam that topped it had all the richness and flavor of a full meal itself, like some sort of Willy Wonka creation. It and the black-bean potstickers I ordered (both vegan) were so rich that I didn't at all regret ordering less than the three-to-four recommended plates per person. The only thing we tasted that didn't meet the prevailing standard of excellence was the bread -- we were glad to have something to munch on while waiting for our food to arrive, but neither the French nor the whole grain tasted any better than what you'd pick up from any grocery store bakery. Not bad, but incongruous.  The ambience is suitably upscale, dark, sleek, yet fairly comfortable. Our waiter was personable, helpful and professional; however, there were long, long delays between some of our courses.  Part of this was because one of our party ordered the tasting menu, while the others ordered fewer courses, but even accounting for this, we did feel impatient at times. Chalk it up to the obvious care put into these dishes, I guess. If you're not wealthy -- and I'm sure not -- this definitely qualifies as special-occasion dining, but our meal was special enough to justify the expense, offering a mostly-smooth dining experience and a meal that left a lasting satisfaction on the palate.",0.9929,0.77,0.192,0.038,0.5669614512471656

2008-08-18,3.0,"I went to Green Zebra for their Sunday brunch and was a tad bit disappointed. First and foremost, the food.  I was so excited to go to a vegetarian restaurant, because as a vegan, fine (American) dining (especially brunch) tends to be less than fine unless the chefs are well-versed in vegan/vegetarian cooking.  I checked the menu online before I went and was looking forward to choosing between a few items, but that menu was outdated, leaving just the $13  ""BLT"" as their sole vegan entree on the brunch menu.  I got it with avocado (highly suggested) and overall it was pretty good, but difficult to eat.  Avocado was squishing out everywhere and the little pieces of ""bacon"" fell out despite my meticulously calculated bites.  The ""bacon"" was a good mix between sweet and salty albeit slightly burned, in a bad way, and far too small in their match-sized strips.  The chips were grease and salt, and though I ate them, I wondered the whole time why I was. My friend ordered a pancake, which she said was very very egg-y, but she left with a happy tummy. Secondly, the service.  Our server was an absolute doll - incredibly helpful to me in ordering, and wrote down good directions to get us from the restaurant to the Lincoln Park Zoo without any sort of hesitation or annoyance.  The hostess and the bus boy, not so much.  They were just generally unfriendly and unwelcoming, doing their job without caring about their actual customers.  At such a place aiming to be more high-end swank, I expect much better customer relations. I stole a peek at their dinner menu, which looks like it boasts several vegan items, and I wish I had stayed in Chicago long enough to try it.  They also have several housemade drinks that sounded delicious, creative, and fresh, but alas, I needed all the coffee I could get on Sunday.  After a little yelp-search, it seems as though vegan eateries are few and far between in Chicago, so I'm glad Green Zebra is here, but I wish that they would step-up the vegan brunch a few notches (and they've clearly got the talent to do so).",0.9948,0.754,0.185,0.061,0.49757201646090543

My courses were as follows:  Thai spiced carrot soup Poached egg with smoked potato puree & sourdough Halibut with lemongrass broth Blueberry crisp I sneaked the following bites from my dining companion: Tempura squash blossom Gnocchi with figs Corn agnolottis with blueberries Ice cream sampler Each dish was unique and delicious in it's own way.  The only dish I did not care for was the Halibut, which needed some serious culinary magic (aka salt, mostly).  Two dishes that stood out were the carrot soup & the corn agnolottis.  The agnolottis were basically heavenly, mini ravioli pillows with a rich mascarpone corn filling, paired with blueberries(!!!) made the dish outstanding.  I looooved it!

They also make their own soft drinks which are pretty tasty. The service itself was also great. Our waitress entertained all of our questions about the food and its preparation and explained every dish to us as it was served.

2008-06-20,5.0,"It's like my prayers were answered. An upscale place that serves all vegetarian food. I don't have to worry about getting served meat accidentally or order all sides to make a full ""meal"".  My husband took me there for my birthday. We made reservations the day of and there wasn't any problem. But I would suggest making reservations.  I think the decor is nice and clean. I love the little leaf shaped bread plates that wait for you on the table. The colors are all pleasing to the eye but I would knock off half a star for the close quarters in which we have to sit. You can hear what everyone around you is saying and you can practically eat off their plate if you wanted to. But please don't.  I ordered the spring onion and green garlic soup with truffle cream for my first course. Delish! And the way they served it was fun! My truffle cream was in my bowl and then they poured the soup from a really interesting looking pot, it looked like a teapot but with a bigger spout. Anyhow, it was wonderful! And just the right amount. I don't see the problem with the portion size at all. The dishes were enough so I felt satisfied but not so much that I didn't have room for the following courses. I think we are so used to gianormous amounts of food, that we should really only be eating half of anyway, that we forget what a correct portion looks like. And I understand that it's pricey for ""smaller"" amounts of food. But you are paying for the chef's abilities to make unbelievably tasty and complex vegetarian dishes, not for quantity. I will always pick quality over quantity when it comes to food. Don't hoover it down, chew slowly to really experience every component. Do I sound like a snooty foodie? Maybe a little but I'm not! I just know it's more enjoyable if you chew your food. :0) Then I had Crispy Potato Tots, Tomato jam, Osaka greens, with Mustard beurre blanc. Again, wonderful. And for my last savory dish, I ordered parmesan and sweet peas risotto with grilled ramps, and pea tendrils. LOVED it. Probably my favorite of the night. Again, a really nice sized portion. Obviously I wasn't stuffed to the brim, but I wasn't left starving either.  And finally my dessert! They brought me two little puffed pastries with a candle and then I ordered the chocolate layer cake with peanut butter mousse,and banana malt ice cream and a nice triangle of peanut brittle. YUM. YUM. YUM. It was moist ( I hate that word in general, but I think someone else said when they had the chocolate cake it wasn't the m word, so I wanted to share what my piece was like!) and rich and it was basically two servings of cake on one plate. This I felt was almost too much food on a plate. But I won't complain when it's still quality and it's something chocolate. :0) I'm not stupid. Normally I don't like banana flavored things but the ice cream really complimented the rest of the dessert. Soooo gooood. I think that cake visits me in my dreams sometimes.  Overall, very attentive and kind service, very efficient. We never felt rushed and truly enjoyed every minute.  One word of advice to patrons- It is a dressy place. Please dress up a little. I guess, by the others I saw while we dined, that a tie and jacket isn't necessary, but it would be nice.Why can't there still be places where you get dressed up a bit? But if you don't want to do that, just don't come in sneakers and a windbreaker. And for that, I am mostly talking to you, tourists. Also please don't bring in your two year old unless they can behave. Why you would bring a toddler to a fancy restaurant that serves courses and ""smaller"" portions with NO kid menu, is beyond me. If you can't get a babysitter, wait it out till they are 5 years old and can sit still for more than 20 minutes.

I spoke to a Green Zebra server prior to eating there and he assured me that if I told my server about my allergies that nothing I was allergic to would come anywhere near my plate or the surfaces in which my food was cooked.  This makes me happy since soy is the bulk of most vegetarian fare.  He was right.  The chef even sent our table a little taster before our first dish that  was made with soy milk, but I got my own little appetizer... sans soy!    It was like he cared! Second, this place doesn't pretend to be cheap, so you shouldn't try to eat on a budget here.  I read in some of the reviews that people left hungry but I feel that is because they didn't listen to their server.  One of the first things our server said was ""they recommend that you order one entree from each of the three groups because each portion is a small plate"" so the girls ordered three entrees, and the guys ordered four.  We hardly had room for dessert!   Third, the food was out of this world.  I had veggie fare that was more substantial than most heavy, meat fare.  We even shared a mushroom popover that actually tasted like beef wellington!  I am not making it up.  I was like magic food.   My advice to people is to check this place out, but be prepared to spend money.  It is totally worth it.",0.987,0.853,0.131,0.015,0.44204931972789113

But back to the food. We had a special menu for our group and I'm not sure how different it was from the menu downstairs.  We started with an arugula salad topped with artichokes and a crostini.  Love arugula - but it was nothing spectacular.  There was also this random shot glass of some kind of soup (not listed on our menu) - no one was really sure what it was.  Next, we had a celery root soup with apple bread (tasty).   The blue cheese agnolotti was one of my favorites.  I am not a huge blue cheese fan, but this was delish.  For my entree, I chose the vegetarian option (we also had the choice of fish), which was a Moroccoan Vegetable Tagine.  This was nothing all that amazing.  I love spicy food.  I love vegetables.  And I love naan.  But otherwise, this was nothing special (although still good). When we got to dessert, I thought my belly might explode.  I am clearly not used to multi-course meals.  But I could not stop eating the cinnamon blinis we had (served with poached pears and vanilla ice cream).  Yum yum.   I would definitely come back to Green Zebra and try dining in the main restaurant.  The atmosphere looked far more lively than the awkward private room we were in, and I would like to be able to have more choices over my menu.",0.9888,0.808,0.135,0.057,0.5227243278263687

Ambience - low light, contemporary and minimal but not sterile surroundings.

Once upon a time, a poached egg was a beautiful thing.  So cheap, and yet so perfect and delicious.  Julia Child recommended slapping one inside a baked potato and serving it to guests as a lunch dish.  Restaurants loved to feature them, since they made people so happy and improved their bottom line.  Eggs Benedict and Eggs Florentine reigned supreme over brunch.  Life was good. Then, a terrible plague swept the nation, devastating families and leaving a wake of sorrow.  I will call this abomination ""overpoach.""  The effects of overpoach are still felt to this day.  A generation of young chefs was seemingly crippled when it swept through the culinary schools.  Every time my mother orders Eggs Benedict at a restaurant I have recommended to her, I see the pain and regret in her face and I must resign myself to the fact that I have failed as a daughter.  She suffers as she remembers brunches past.  She was a dink WASP during the Golden Age. I will take my mother to Green Zebra, because it has sheltered the fragile egg from the forces of overpoach.  The full glory of the poached egg manifested itself at my table, and my friend and I were appropriately awed.  We were reminded of how special a simple thing can be.  The white was delicate and tasty, and the rich yolk exploded and infected the surrounding ingredients with its deliciousness.  I am salivating, remembering this egg.  I am going to finish this review, throw a potato in the oven, and go to the store because holy shit I can't believe I don't already have these wonderful things in my house.  So Green Zebra, bravo.  I will definitely come back.  I will plan to spend at least one hundred dollars per person, with tax, cheaper wine option, and tip.  I will raise eyebrows by demanding the entire basket of bread be left at my table.  I will feel okay about that.  And I will possibly give you five stars the second time around.  I'm sweeter when I am not hungry.",0.9877,0.742,0.155,0.103,0.5719908814589666

2007-07-24,5.0,"If I thought San Francisco was a mecca of dining, it was only because I hadn't yet opened my soul up to the possibility of Chicago. While I always believed that LA lacked a substantial foodie restaurant scene, I never thought I would find the Bay at a lack for culinary excellence in any category of cuisine. I was wrong and Green Zebra--with its small plates vegetarian concept--has thrown my faith on shaky ground. While Greens and Millenium meet the demand for upscale vegetarian in the Bay, they do not meet my new standard for sophistication. Though, I have often been impressed by meatless side dishes, I have yet to encounter a successful wholly vegetarian establishment. So what I really mean is that SF and LA lack vegetarian restaurants of the same caliber. There were only two dishes with protein on the entire New American menu. Our waiter recommended that we order three dishes each, unaware that we had small appetites and affinities for dessert. We settled on four and were started off with an amuse of Watermelon and Vanilla Soup. The watermelon was clarified to the level of a consomm, though there was added pulp for texture--kind of like a smoother watermelon agua fresca. Refreshed, our palates waited for the coming night. The Lacinato Kale Agnolotti and Turnip Risotto Cakes were the lighter of our four dishes and were paired as our first course. The Agnolotti ($13) were filled with kale, snap peas, baby squash, and marscarpone, though the most predominant flavor came from the ramps (wild leeks). Scattered on top and pureed in a sauce, the ramps gave the pasta a full-bodied flavor reminiscent of Asian dumplings. An additional balsamic reduction allowed the components of the dish to shine even brighter and you could have fooled me into believing the pasta was filled with a strong, aromatic lamb. It was my favorite dish of the night. I enjoyed the contrast of textures in the Turnip Risotto Cakes ($14), which were crispy on the outside without sacrificing the glutinous quality of risotto that I am so fond of. The turnip was subtle, though the foraged mushrooms more than compensated. We wanted to make sure that every major food group received equal representation, so took it upon ourselves to order both the Prospera Farms Chicken Egg ($11) and Roasted Halibut (the two proteins on the menu).  The key success factor for any poached egg is the interplay of the yolk against the other liquid elements of the plate--smoked potato and parsley purees--and the ""sponge element"" (sourdough bread), which is used to mop up the mixture. The smoked potatoes tasted of pure bacon and together with the parsley and the egg, made for the ultimate comfort food.  Needless to say, we used every last crumb of that sourdough to lap up the sloppy mess we made of the dish. The Roasted Halibut ($17) was less successful and while moist, had flavors which were unfocused and flat.  The fingerling potatoes, asparagus, and fennel were good in and of themselves, though their flavors were neither complementary nor unpleasant to the fish.  A mediocre dish on the whole--not bad, but not very good either. Service throughout the night was impersonal, though our waiter seemed to warm up as his night drew to an end.  I guess I wouldn't want to be working on a Friday night either.   The dining room was appropriately Zen chic with moss green banquettes and sandy brick walls, while the shadows of palm fronds took on lives of their own under the soft lighting. If I had to put a name to the type of restaurant commanding a ""Smart Casual"" dress code, Green Zebra would be it.

The portions are incredibly small and are meant to be shared, however, we ordered six items between two people and left somewhat hungry. The chickpea pancake? Fantastic. The risotto? Fantastic. The gnocchi? Not so good.  And as for the atmosphere..You'd better be ready for a lot of noise. Between the trance beats that they play and the number of tables actually in the restaurant, it's hard to hear your dinner date talking across the table. You'd better lean in if you want to make sure that you caught all of the details. Oh - and don't talk about anything too personal..Chances are you'll have a table literally twelve inches away from you.

I am no longer a vegetarian but would still love to come back to this place.  When I first entered the door I was amused by the decor. It is a bit different. I don't remember what it looked like exactly but it did seem a bit busy. There were fake stair or something to that resemblance.  The bar is off to the back and the drinks were very good.  The menu is more of a tasting, but don't worry you will be full. The way it works is you order 3 different things, one from each section. Each plate packed a lot of flavor and don't be scared by the portions. They are very small but I was sooooo full by the 2nd or third tasting. I guess when it has so much texture and flavor you aren't overeating. Plus its a tasting, so you get to enjoy many different tastes through out the night. I remember getting this soup in a shot glass and it was sooo creamy and full of body. I am craving some right now....  I definitely recommend this place to anyone.

I love it and therefore my review will reflect my own opinion.   Their organic wine and beer selection is awesome and I recommend the Japanese white beer and the Green Zebra cocktail.  Since it has been awhile I am sure the things we ordered are different, but anything with avocado or heirloom vegetables is awesome.  Also, the fact that the chef included a gratis amuse bouche was appreciated for the uninitiated. The atmosphere rocks and is filled with fellow bohemian, progressive foodies.  Make sure to get an earlier reservation, stay as long as you can and then head to Avec (for non-organic wine, but lots of it). :)",0.9846,0.776,0.224,0.0,0.5955555555555556

Great combinations of flavors, using seasonal (and local-ish) ingredients. Presentation is wonderful, from the ambience on.
