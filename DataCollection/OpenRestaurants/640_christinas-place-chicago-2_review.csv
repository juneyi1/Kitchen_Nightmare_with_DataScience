Why pay 8 dollars for a beer when you can get a 3$ Guinness or 2$ pbr.  If you fancy highbrow flavor, they're available in plentiful amounts with a good selection of micro brews and spirits.

2016-02-02,3.0,"In my experience you find a few types frequenting Christina's. Passive aggressive neighborhood locals. Crowds truly trying to squeeze every ounce out of the night looking for the last and latest drink. Usually someone you fairly know and are trying to avoid. And someone's cheating significant other. I learned this and more the couple months I frequented regularly. No judgements here though. I've gotten by with very cheap tabs here, pickles on the house, and free shots. It really is a dive bar but not in the sense of how the hipster movement popularized them. I wouldn't say there's anything necessarily nice about the place except the fact that they sell alcohol, have a kitchen, pool table, and touch tunes. Well actually that is pretty nice but there is some meaning somewhere in that statement. The burly bouncer Dennis is a stand up dude, respectable.  If you're looking to squeeze in that last drink then go for it. But no matter which dive bar it is you can usually go home or to someone else's place.",0.9661,0.794,0.156,0.05,0.5194871794871795

Okay, so I've been coming here on near a decade since I moved in to the neighborhood, lots of things have changed, but the most important things are still the same. Lovely Guinness pints are now $3 instead of $2, but inflation is a %^&*$, you can walk a few blocks west to the Abbey Pub for a great show, but their Guinness pints are $6 and good luck trying to get the same kind of personable service there, and if you can find somewhere else that pours flawless pints of Guinness at that price point, you should be there drinking them, but since that place doesn't exist, come here. This is a fantastic neighborhood 4am bar where you are welcome whether you are white, black, asian, female, tranny, hispanic, gay, lesbian, etc, or just annoying but still tolerable as a human being (if you're from Schaumburg though, just $&*% off and die). The owner built this kitchen in the corner a few years ago that is literally no bigger than a broom closet, and I would give 3 stars for any human being that could put edible food out of there, but the $1 burgers are a great deal.   Aubrey will definitely take really good care of you as long as you aren't a total $(@*#$()%*(!.

2014-04-10,2.0,"3/18/2012 This bar is very small, even though the outside makes it look to be about the size of an average Chicago Walgreens (which is bigger then most bars) and to also have two floors.  If you were the only one in this bar, it would be hard to walk around except in the back, behind the pool table, where no one would ""be"" i.e. it's not in the area that is part of ""places to stand"".  You might stand normally stand there voluntarily if you are waiting for someone, pissed off, or playing Game Boy for example.  There are a total of two tables with three chairs each, but the tables are big enough for only one (maybe - if ONLY drinks are on it), and if you use the chairs no one can walk by.  So you cannot sit down unless you sit at the bar. Karaoke is on Saturday.  The karaoke is falsely advertised in that the bar is open 'til 5 a.m., but karaoke *ENDS AT 3* and doesn't even start 'til nearly midnight (though it's done by a guy with a laptop (real mike though) so it could be more ""whenever he feels like it"" and therefore start earlier on some days, yet none of the websites talking about Christina's Place (which mention both karaoke and open hours) mention this at all!  However, Christina's Place does not seem to have a website, so the misleading information is on external websites and therefore most likely posted by customers.  Unfortunately the only way to leave on public transportation stops running around 12:30, so it's pretty bad if you come there without knowing in advance that they end the karaoke. The singers are half-ignored and half-payed attention to, which is good if you want to do songs you aren't good at yet.  It also seems you might be able to sing more then twice a night if you can avoid being pissed off long enough to want to sing at that moment.  However, the songs done SUCKS.  The first guy actually did ""Luck Be A Lady Tonight"" (um, wtf???).  The song selections available is rather large and includes enough ""awesome"" songs as well as some other songs to do, but the songs the customers actually pick are like you were 10 and at your uncle's wedding in a soccer-mom family in 1991.  In other words the songs you'd do if you've never even heard of either Nirvana or 2Pac.  Unfortunately, they also have Mexican songs available, and while I was there people used them.  This is not a Mexican or Spanish-language bar. Guinness is $2 but it's served warm and at various levels of pour.  They also do not use Guinness or Coke-like glasses but use angled glasses instead.  The first one I got was as disgusting as Trader Todd's $3 generic stout and the last one would have been great if it had you know actually been fucking cold. The place is not very clean, perhaps ""dingy"".  Most of the floor actually made out of an unfinished plank or sheet of wood, like a homeless guy might use to cover an oily spot on the floor of their trailer, or what you expect if you ask for wood sheets on FreeCycle.  A very small portion of the floor is clean white ceramic tile, this is where I put my things.  The walls are dusty.  The bar countertop, and a weird home-kitchen ""island"" long-""countertop"" thing they also have, is VERY clean (except for the whole not-cleaning-up-a-giant-spill-for-a-whole-hour thing).  The female bathroom is clean, sort-of (at the beginning of the night anyway), like if you were in someone's shitty Chicago house or maybe trailer or something who had this bathroom, and cleaned like you do for a house, but the ""style"" of bathroom makes it seem dirty anyway; like you might expect to find in a tow truck shop.  You could not put anything on the floor, fortunately there was elsewhere to put my bags (outside the bathroom) on the day I went.  The male bathroom is smaller and smells like piss (piss not pee). There were two bartenders, a female and a male.  The female was really nice.  The male, who may be the owner, ignored me for about an hour and a half while I either signaled or attempted to say ""excuse me"" as he walked by a total of about 30 times.  I say ""attempted"" because in the millisecond that it took for the signal to get from my brain to my mouth to open it, he was already either in the back, at the opposite side of the bar, or getting something for someone else (usually someone who just walked up).  After this hour and a half, the female asked ""Is everything alright,"" not because I'd been crying and making annoyed gestures every time the male passed me without allowing me to say anything and/or ignored my signals, but because they saw what I'd written on Yelp, which was this only shorter, worded more strongly, and with 1 star.  I was offered first to be given a free drink ($2), THEN asked to delete the review in exchange.  However, I didn't actually even get a free drink because later a customer spilled my full glass, AGAIN.  The female who talked to me is really nice while she's talking but I'm not gonna lie or think a place is better then I thought before just because employees are nice!",0.7571,0.83,0.087,0.083,0.4788417138417138

Public transit access is only fair by Chicago standards; there's no longer a CTA bus line on Kedzie.  One-quarter mile from stops on the 80-Irving Park, 82-Kimball, and 152-Addison lines.  Nearest ""L"" stations are Belmont or Addison on the Blue Line, both about one mile, which can be partly bridged by the 82 or 152 bus lines, respectively.

2012-01-30,4.0,"So the other night my buddy and I were hankering for an unassuming place to meet up and watch the Bulls over some inexpensive beers. Said buddy challenged me to find the best $2 beer deal on the North Side and I think I nailed it with Christina's! $2 proper pours of Guinness stout all day every day! SERIOUSLY?!? That's less than we paid for pints at the Irish pub I worked at in college LONG LONG ago! So I imagine this kind of deal keeps the place abuzz at all hours of the day and night. I forget the name of the first bartender who greeted us, but he was a hoot. I nicknamed him 'Schneider' due to a brief and very odd exchange regarding the comparative virtues of the cast members of 'One Day at a Time'. After 'Schneider' left, Rory (the owner of this fine establishment) worked the bar like a well-oiled machine. His Irish brogue seemed to make the Guinness taste even better. Lots of board games including an interesting and hilariously outdated Chicago trivia game line the wall at the end of the bar. There is a limited menu including a great (and unpublished) $5 quarter-pound burger and Guinness deal. My buddy happy drank his pint and took the sizable burger for the road. I think they have a few other sandwiches and inexpensive frozen pizzas they can whip up for you as well. Out back there's a small space for smoking (but don't take your beer glass outside) that Rory says may be transformed into a beer garden someday. That might be a nice add, indeed. Call this place a dive, if you will, but it's got tons more charm than your average corner tap. The locals keep the place hopping during the week and I imagine people come from all over the city on the weekends. A great first visit, yes indeedy! Heck, I found out my buddy ended up back there for a quick late afternoon tipple just two days later. He had company business in the neighborhood right before 5pm and another $2 pint apparently proved irresistible!",0.9942,0.823,0.15,0.027,0.38192918192918196

The $2 Guinness is also a bonus, and seems to taste better than all the other Guinness I've tasted elsewhere (seriously- I usually don't like it at all, but here find it tasty). There are some nice people here, but if you're staying late it's probably good to go with someone else to stave off some of the psychopaths who might show up.",0.9868,0.727,0.231,0.042,0.5764705882352942
2006-12-03,5.0,"Stopped in here after work one day.  I had heard certain things about it, which may make it one of the coolest places in Chicago. I'm not going to say what makes it so cool, but let's just say it's the local secret around these parts. I shot the shit with Joe, the friendly bartender.  We chatted about baseball, even though I like the Cubs and he's a Sox fan.  That's how this place is: just conducive to nice and friendly conversation.  He was nice enough to give me a couple of drinks on the house.  Good guy. I've seen it since get packed to the gills though.  Not surprising since this bar's cool and not much is around, besides the Abbey Pub a few blocks down.  Plus its open until 4am.   So if you want to find out why I like this bar so much, you'll have to visit it yourself.",0.9923,0.718,0.261,0.021,0.5144620811287477
