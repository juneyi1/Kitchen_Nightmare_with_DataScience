2017-09-01,5.0,"After a lot of over hearing conversations about this place, I decided to check this place out. We had a few hours to do whatever before a Cubs game. Sadly we might of been a little under dressed with Cubs T-shirt and a jersey but whatever. They did sit us at a bar so maybe that had something to do with it? All joking aside.... The server was very friendly and asked if it was our first time. We said yes and he took the time to explain the menu and how everything could be alters due to allergies and what not. Also, the desserts take about 25 minutes so we should look at it now so the wait after dinner won't take forever. Besides, by seeing the Cubs clothes and the time, I think he knew we were going to the game in a few hours. I did like our server. I think his name was JR? I decided to order the Beef Wellington. It came with roasted carrots and fried brussel sprouts. I do not like Brussels Sprouts but they were delicious and I think besides the Beef, it was the only thing I finished. The Carrots were nicely roasted and it came with 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. The Beef Wellington came out with 4 medallions, duxelles (mushrooms) and topped with a puff pastry. No wonder the it came out fairly quickly. The meat and the food was nicely seasoned and it was delicious.  My girlfriend has the Short Rib grilled cheese and added a salad instead of fries. She seemed to enjoy her meal and ate almost all of it. The drinks were amazing. I ordered a pina colada and this place has maybe the top 3 best I've ever had.  Overall, I can see the hype about this location. It hit all the right notes with great and friendly servers, a nice location and very nice view. Great food and great drinks. I am sure I will be back very soon.",0.9981,0.762,0.226,0.012,0.5671915002560165

2017-08-27,1.0,"Stop by Grand Lux on a Monday (8.21.17) evening. I sat at the bar and received the worst service of my life! Disclaimer: I work in the hospitality industry, so I understand that things happen, but this was bad.  First I ordered my food and wine then shortly after that my check was dropped. This was before I even had my food. Not only was that completely rude, but it was stupid on the bartender end because he taking money out f his pocket. I may have wanted to order more to drink. Then I realized I didn't have any water. After countless attempts to get the bartenders attention I finally able to ask for a glass of water. However, I did not get it immediately a server assistant brought it over 5 minutes later. Then the food arrived, and to my surprise, I did not have any silverware. I gave up trying to get the bartender attention and just asked the closest employee. My food was good... the only highlight of my experience. While I was eating the bartender finally checked on me and he saw that I paid my bill. I paid in exact cash. I wanted to wait to see how the rest of my service went before I tipped. So he took the money and when he realized it was exact change I guess he assumed I wasn't going to tip so he did not come back over to me for the remainder of my dinner.  So sat there for a bit finishing my wine and hoped he would come back over so I could ask for a box, and obviously, that did not happen, so I asked the closest employee for a box, which happens to be the manager. The manager asked the bartender to get the box and apparently he seemed to have time after being directed by his manager. The bartender got my box, I packed up my food, and I left.  All in all, I did end up leaving a 20% tip. Only because I work in the industry and I didn't want to penalize every one night because of a bad bartender since the tips could have been split with the entire house.  Would I go back? Absolutely Not! Clearly, this restaurant is poorly managed. They are ill staffed and the managers should either staff more people of getting behind the bar and start making drinks themselves. People don't go to restaurants to spend there hard earn money just to be completed ignored if that was the case everyone would eat at Chipotle.",-0.9568,0.888,0.035,0.077,0.5466145833333333
2017-08-25,5.0,"Went here two days in a row. First time, I had the Southwestern Salad which was excellent and humongous. Couldn't eat it all but I did manage to eat all the chicken. The second night, my friend and I shared the Nashville hot chicken since the portion included 3 big chicken breasts. While cutting the 3rd breast in half, I noticed it wasn't fully cooked. The waitress got the manager and he apologized profusely. So he said he would comp the meal and we thought he would bring us one chicken breast instead, he sent us a whole new platter. We were out of towners so we really couldn't store the extra food anywhere. Later that night, my friend ate a chicken breast and I managed to carry mine back home on the plane the next day and it was STILL GOOD.",0.969,0.842,0.147,0.012,0.4692640692640692

Overall I like the food (the baked to order cookies are to die for) most times I get the shrimp (it comes with chicken but I never get it like that) jambalaya (with spaghettini noodles and extra sauce). I like almost all of the pasta dishes (I always get shrimp instead of whatever meat that's listed). I ALWAYS take an order of cookies to go. Usually whomever I'm with orders the buffalo chicken rolls and they always love em. This last time I ordered the shrimp (I can't remember the name but I'll post a pic), as far as I'm concerned they can take them off the menu because they're simply not worth it. Also this time bc my jambalaya came out with chicken I decided to change my order all together and get a different shrimp pasta (again I can't remember the name but I'll post the pic).

I have yet to eat here and the wait was less than 20 minutes;  even after being told that it would only be 10 minutes.  The level of service seems to have dwindled over time. The last time I ate here, a server questioned us disbelievingly after we had been seated as if we had jumped the line and seated ourselves. Even after we stated that we had been seated by the hostess, we saw him go ask several people to verify our statement. After already waiting an extended time to be seated and the additional time to be vindicated by the hostess, we finally were offered menus. At this point, we requested a different waiter before ordering our meals.  Needless to say, our displeasure was made known in several manners before we left the restaurant.

2017-08-12,4.0,"Grand Lux is pretty amazing for their cocktails alone. It's beautiful inside and it almost seems like just grabbing a cocktail here would be a waste because the food is so good. But, there are some really good cocktails on the menu. If you're ordering a main dish - I would go with the champagne or a glass of wine - it just pairs better. I had the Laurent-Perrier, Brut, France champagne, which is drier and comes in a cute mini bottle. But, when you're having apps, I would order the Passion in Paradise. It's a rum drink with Sailor Jerry Spiced Rum, Pineapple, Passion Fruit and Fresh Lemon. It's tropical, it's big, and it's strong, and seriously refreshing. The Appetizers and Salad: You quite honestly don't want to miss the appetizers. The portion sizes of the main dishes are quite large, but when you're staying for a while, treat yourself to one of restaurant goers favorites - the Buffalo Chicken Rolls. I know! I was skeptical because it seems like an Asian twist on sports food - and it was - but it was really good. The Buffalo Chicken Rolls have Chicken Breast, Cheese and Our Very Spicy Delicious Buffalo Sauce all Rolled in a Spiced Wrapper and Fried until Crisp. Served with Celery Sticks and Blue Cheese Dressing (which you can swap for Ranch). Another appetizer that I wanted to try was the Ahi Ceviche which has Fresh Raw Ahi Tuna Diced and Marinated in Lime Juice, Chiles and Cilantro. Tossed with Avocado, Tomato, Onion and Cucumber. But of course, we only have one stomach. So, I tried my date's Pot Roast Cheese Fries, which is basically pot roast flavored fries. It's French Fries Topped with Chunks of Tender Pot Roast Smothered with Gravy and Creamy Cheddar Cheese Sauce. The Main: I think the Cedar Plank BBQ salmon was nicely flavored and the side of mashed potatoes are amazing. It is roasted on a Cedar Plank and Glazed with Sweet and Spicy B.B.Q. Sauce. Served with Mashed Potatoes, Corn Succatash and Crispy Onion Rings. Then, there's the salmon three ways -  Soy Glazed with Shiitake Mushrooms, Horseradish Crusted with Asparagus and Almond Ginger with Green Beans and Beurre Blanc. Some of the salmon was a bit dry for my liking. But, I will say the horseradish crusted with asparagus and almond ginger was a great blend. The Dessert: The best part of the meal is dessert! I liked the Warm Sticky Bun Bread Pudding. The Sticky Bun's crunch and the sweet caramel drizzle are completed with a side of whip cream, which both complements and cools the dessert and you can get the recipe on  windycitycosmo.com But, I went with the Godiva chocolate cheesecake and paired it with their cappuccino. I'm seriously obsessed with the cappuccino's here. They are the best because they do have an onsite bakery and coffee shop. This cheesecake is one of my favorite desserts in the city. It was rich. It was creamy. It's also huge, so you can split it with your date or a group of friends or take some home like I did.",0.9988,0.764,0.211,0.025,0.6274491465980827

Got a booth along the window so it started out great. Only to go downhill from there. The waitress was rude and was trying to rush us. Telling us to hurry and order because they were closing in 50 minutes. That's nearly an hour so I don't think she should've rushed us. She didn't even get a drink order for us. While our food was being cooked she brought us a couple pieces of bread. We had to flag her to get some sodas and ask three times for more bread. The last time I asked for it she tells me ""I know, I know...bread."" The bread, drinks and food finally come. I look at his meal and see what I thought was a manicotti noodle under some veggies which surprised me because he ordered Carmel chicken with mash potatoes. So I ask him about it. Upon looking better at it, it turned out to be a piece of plastic. We called for a Manager and showed it to him. He stated that ""it was a piece of plastic that was cut off a squeeze bottle. That it must've flown onto the plate."" Somehow it flew in the air, onto the plate and then under some food. Needless to say we decided to leave and eat somewhere else. I would definitely recommend going somewhere else to eat unless you like a rude waitress and possibly plastic pieces in your food. The Manager was very apologetic and offered to take it off our bill and still replace the meal and buy us desert. We declined however and thanked him but our appetite was gone.

My husband got the shrimp scampi, which is served with pasta and you can have them shred parmesan cheese on top. This dish was amazing! It was so savory, lemony, and creamy. It reminded me of a picatta sauce. Oh and I forgot to mention, they do give you a warm bread basket with a side of butter. Two-thumbs up for the Grand Lux!",0.9889,0.805,0.195,0.0,0.6914285714285715
2017-07-02,3.0,My husband wanted to eat here for Father's Day.  We arrived around 7 and had to wait about 20 minutes which is a short period based on the day.   Pros:  Our waitress was very nice and attentive.  Once we ordered our food came quickly and everyone's order was correct Cons:  My step son observed the valet speed racing to the point of making my car tires screech while taking my son to a nearby store while my husband and I waited for a table. When my husband and I brought those observations to the head valet we didn't even receive an apology.  I'll go to the suburbs next time.,0.5095,0.959,0.041,0.0,0.54

2017-06-29,5.0,"Grand Lux is one of my favorite places to eat when in the Chicago loop (when I'm not working in the loop 9-5 every day!).  It isn't the easiest place to find parking, but it is well worth the trouble finding a spot.  And well worth the wait, if there is one when you go (it has been either busy or not so busy when I've gone, so it's hit or miss).   The ambiance is classy.  Reminds me of Cheesecake Factory with it's color scheme and exotic embellishments.  You have to take an escalator up to the actual restaurant - if you can get a window seat - go for it!  Watch all those tired shoppers while you relax and eat a delicious meal.   I have been here so many times, I'm not sure exactly what to review first.  Here goes: French Toast:  Brioche bread was soft and delicious, and drenched in butter and syrup. The photo I posted is from a few years ago, so I'm not sure they have this one anymore.  it was like a bananas foster type of French toast, with a caramel sauce and nuts and bananas.  If all they have now is regular brioche French toast, I'm sure it's great. Beignets:  Wow, delicious!  So soft and warm and sweet, with a few different dipping sauces - you can't go wrong ordering these as a dessert. Grand Lux Burger Melt:  One of the best burgers I've had!  I think I've ordered this every time I've been to Grand Lux for either lunch or dinner.  I just can't think of trying something new!  Fresh baked-to-order chocolate chip cookies:  Great for a long train ride home.  Warm, gooey and delicious.   Highly recommend if you're shopping the Mag Mile and want some great comfort food.",0.9983,0.662,0.286,0.052,0.5604770784770785

I ordered the Pasta Pomodoro with a side house salad and it was perfect. My dad got fish tacos and a kale salad which he greatly enjoyed. For dessert we shared an order of New Orleans beignets, which were round rather than the traditional rectangular shape, but delicious all the same. The raspberry sauce they came with was my favorite.

I asked the waiter what his favorite pasta was...he recommended the Telephono. He mentioned it had a bit of a kick.... I generally like spicy, but this was way too spicy. I ate maybe a quarter of the pasta dish. I also asked the waiter for more bread to help calm the spice down and he never brought it (he was great in the beginning and then the service went downhill fast). Oh and I nearly froze to death while eating my spicy pasta. On the positive side, the buffalo chicken sandwich was excellent. I gave this place four stars because this is the first time I've been unsatisfied. I'll blame this on the waiter and his poor suggestions.

2017-06-12,5.0,"To say I adore this place is an understatement!! We were checking out yesterday from the hotel and we asked the front desk manager her thoughts on a place for lunch/brunch. She quickly let us know this was one of her favorite places for every meal just a couple blocks down! We wanted to leave our car as we had all weekend so it was a no brainer to go. Located right by the ATT store, stepping inside is like stepping into another area. It's very ornate and the decor is just gorgeous. After telling the hostess how many you take the elevator up to talk to another hostess. Reservations are preferred it seems but they will take you if they can accommodate with a smile. We waited no more than ten to be seated. The service was prompt. They made a mean strawberry martini! Strong is word I would use to describe it. The menu is extensive. They have something to fit everyone's fancy. From brunch items to burgers to wood oven pizzas to soups and salads to an excellent lunch menu where the lo lunch portions look more like what if imagine dinner to look like. We started with the duck triangles on the tapas part of the menu. Amazing to say the least!! I opted for the southwestern chicken salad and it was quite possibly the best salad I've ever had. And no I don't say that lightly. Salad is not my go to for lunch even though I'm working on it (seriously working on it). It had grilled chicken, black beans, corn on a bed of crisp romaine lettuce topped with tortilla strips and pepper jack cheese, tossed in a light cilantro lime vinegarette with a wedge of fresh avocado and tomato. I was literally working to finish as much of this as possible as if it was a piece of cheesecake I couldn't take with me. Obviously I failed majorly by its size but it was decadent (again not a word that coincides with salad typically for me). Would we go back?? In a heartbeat.

2017-06-01,3.0,"Sorry, massive portions can't compensate for mediocre quality. On both of our mid-week visits we were immediately seated in the main lounge, along the wall nearest the kitchen entrance. Our waiter was super-attentive, but not hovering - he ripped through the daily specials, reminding us -over and over and over- about the ""massive portions, just like our sister restaurant The Cheesecake Factory.."". (Well, that explains everything!) The restaurant itself is huge, featuring high ceilings and deep, rich red décor -  despite two walls of floor-to-ceiling windows, the place is amazingly dark, even at mid-day. And pack a sweater - even during the summer, the place swings from being chilly to downright cold.  The $16 Chicken Pot Pie came to the table in a massive yet shallow bowl, covered in a thin, browned hubcap of tough, overworked pastry dough. The white meat chicken itself was plentiful, shredded into long strips, but glued together in a flavorless béchamel sauce, occasionally dotted with green peas and undercooked cubes of white potato. The crème brûlée-like lid had to be lifted off the flour-y concoction hidden underneath since a fork and knife only sent the ceramic bowl sliding across the super-slick marble-topped table like a hockey puck on ice.  The ""deconstructed"" Bento box of steak au poivre ($16) came on four square plates that took up more than a quarter of the acreage on the table - the mixed green salad was wilted and watery (and was left, untouched), the parmesan dusted frites were crisp, the creamed cauliflower soup was super rich and flavorful, as were the peppery steak bites, despite being cooked past the medium-rare my wife ordered. Again, the plates seemed to hover across the slick tabletop every time she tried to cut her steak bites, so she opted to place her napkin down to dampen the movement. We ordered a $8 slice of Red Velvet Cake to go and truly enjoyed that while people watching at the park in nearby Streeterville. All total, a whopping $50.00 (with tip) for an O'Charley's-like supper club offering.",0.9857,0.891,0.093,0.016,0.5417615176151762

I threw down my fork and instantly demanded to speak to the manager. I was so upset that I ended up crying because I've dined in other restaurants before and never had this horrible of an experience. The manager comped my meal and offered to get me something else and I told him to bring me a bucket so I can throw up because I couldn't think of ordering something else and possibly finding more hair in my meal.

Me and my wife dine-in that night knowing we were going to get epcetional service but we didn't. When we were sitted, our waitress named Tuul came to our table rushing us for our choice of drinks. Which she did mention she wasn't trying to rush or anything but the vibe the waitress were delivering was not a good one. So I ordered a sprite (w/no ice) and my wife ordered a martini drink and she brought it back rushing us to order. We couldn't even get the menu open well enough to decide what we wanted. Now keep in mind, the young lady did not have an attitude, it was just the way she was rushing us to order. So when we finally was ready to order the appetizer, we asked for the grand calamari and she rushed off stating ""I will get that started"". We paused and stared at each other in disbelief. Then, when she came back to due her rounds, we caught her attention and told her we wasn't done ordering. She stated 3 times to my wife she couldn't hear her (while standing 6-12 inches for us while leaning forward), which my wife perjected her voice loud enough so she can be heard. The waitress said ""well, I have other people's credit in my hand ready to cash out and we was taking long"". So I asked for the manager and the manager Kat (her name) was very very helpful and assigned a waiter to our table. The gentleman name Derrick was nice but you can tell he did NOT want to serve an extra table. We was still satisfied with his service until the payment of the bill was due. Well.... the bill was $103 and my wife paid $110 (due to budget reasons). I asked him (Derrick) what is his name and the names of the waitress and manager, he stated ""I hope the last waitress did not have an affect of me receiving a tip. Because the bill was over $100 and a $4 tip does not look good"" (while walking away). Of course, we got up and asked for another manager, which he was very helpful and stated the other manager was in the back helping with the orders getting out on time. I will like to state me and my wife will never go there if knowing those two (Kat or Derrick) will be serving our tables.",0.992,0.878,0.108,0.014,0.4344252873563218

2017-02-10,3.0,"As a first time diner, I was hoping this place would be as great as the reviews. The day started off great as I arrived with a friend and was seated within minutes. Our server was prompt with offerings of helpful menu suggestions. After speaking with us, he took our order of two drinks with a few appetizers, the Buffalo egg rolls, spinach dip and pot roast fries. This is where the evening starts to turn sour. The egg rolls and fries were delicious and satisfactory. We could have eaten them all day however, the dip was cold. No problem they later warmed it for us. That was quick and simple. We sampled the dip again but this time we noticed it had a fishy taste. We love dip, especially this kind, so when the taste was off we noticed immediately and told the server. He explained that is was probably the broth and that he would take it away for us. Thank you for that. After the appetizers, we waited a while for our main course which we didn't mind but we were still hungry and it felt longer. Once our meal came we were happy to dig in. We had the pot pie and salisbury steak. My meal was pretty good, not very hot but filling. My friend didn't enjoy his meal at all. I took a bite myself and noticed that the meat had a burnt taste. It looked pretty charred also. We requested the help of our server once again. He says hold on for a moment and walks away. He returns with the manager who proceeds to inform us that the steak is cooked on a flat top and that's why it's crunchy. As if we couldn't possibly understand the difference between crunchy and burnt. He then says that if we  kept eating the ""crunchy"" would be less pronounced. At this point my friend is quite offended, myself included, because he cooks often enough to understand the cooking process. It completely ruined our experience but I finished my meal and we decided to cancel our dessert order so we could leave.  This rating is for the apps and our personal server. I wish the manager had paid better attention to our complaint instead of treating us like that.",0.9951,0.78,0.171,0.049,0.5541145635973223

Walking in you are greeted with a warm welcome as the staff seamlessly give you an exceptional dining experience. The management and staff are well informed of their menu, and they give notable recommendations for either food or drinks. The servers provided admirable service; checking on our table enough to ensure we would be pleased with our meals or keeping us informed as our food was being prepared.  During our visit I ordered the Chilaquiles; a perfect meal for anyone out for weekend brunch. The food I received was heavenly, and consisted of an abundance of fresh flavor with the cool cilantro, crispy tortilla chips, and zesty ranchero sauce. My friend accompanying me for brunch ordered the ""Churro"" French Toast; an appetizing meal meant to share with others. This creation was scrumptious with its crispy French toast powdered with cinnamon sugar and was accompanied with a delectable choice of dark rich chocolate dipping sauce or decadent Dulce de Leche sauce. Both dishes provided a new and contemporary twist on two different common breakfast dishes.

2017-01-02,2.0,"I have fond memories of visiting the Grand Lux Cafe when I was younger and loving it--but dined here recently and was disappointed. The restaurant hasn't changed much, rather I finally realized it was just an ornate, gaudy Klimt's-gold-period-esque version of the Cheesecake Factory.  The building is pretty, in that overstated way. Gold columns, garnishes, and jewel-toned accents everywhere. If you're visiting Chicago and looking for a unique restaurant that isn't actually all that adventurous food-wise, this could be a good option. There are large, comfortable booths and tables, and the restaurant is giant; reservations not necessary here.  On this recent visit, we received below-par service. I asked the waiter 3x for tea, and they kept forgetting to bring it. The drinks from the bar took 20 minutes. When the tea finally came, it was the wrong kind. The food orders were mixed up-etc. It was one of those meals where you feel like a jerk asking the waitstaff yet again for mustard, but you're simultaneously irked that you're being put in that position.  The food is fine here--nothing special and nothing horrible, though I'm sure people have varying experiences. The restaurant is so huge that everything can't possibly be amazing all the time. You're bound to get wilted lettuce occasionally. The menu is giant, and encompasses everything from omelettes to jambalaya to spring rolls and sandwiches. I dare you to look at this 12 page menu and find absolutely *nothing* that you'd want to eat. It's impossible. Some standouts are the salads, which have a nice flavor--and the desserts. You get giant portions here--even the lunch-sized option must be a full day's worth of food.

First, they use pagers to let people know that their table is ready... however, the person behind the counter didn't have any pagers, so she just kept telling people they would have to wait to even check in. Then she kept radioing up to the folks upstairs for them to bring down the pagers.... seriously... anyone???? She had to radio multiple times before someone showed up with pagers for her.  Then, we they went to seat us, they tucked us in the very back and dark corner right by the kitchen swinging door. Really? When we said we didn't want to be sitting in the dark when they have multiple HUGE rooms where there's light. I had to go to the front to complain, who told me that people had reserved seats so there weren't any open 4-tops available (we were a party of 4). Which I know isn't true because we walked by at least 10 open 4-tops in the middle of the room. Come on--- people didn't reserve those. When I complained to the manager, I got the same answer... which I told him I didn't accept. We ended up getting a booth. Which was just fine... but just a regular 4-top in a sunnier part of the room was all we wanted. I mean, come on... the place is big enough folks and we could see a dozen open 4-tops! The meal was delicious as always..... had the Asian chicken salad. My kids got the HUGE burgers and were thrilled. But then I went to the bathroom and a couple of the stalls had NO toilet paper. And the trash cans were so full that people were throwing their paper towels onto the floor.  I've been here a number of times... and I have to say the service was a complete and utter miss on this occasion. It's been a while since I'd been here and I'm wondering if this is reflective of the state of the restaurant on most days... This review is getting 2 stars only because we did enjoy the meal... but there are some serious improvements to be had, folks.",0.9686,0.869,0.086,0.045,0.4613036269286269

Coffee, as everyone knows, has a distinct ""coffee"" smell that even if you're not a coffee drinker, can appreciate the smell of fresh brewed coffee, but this one, did NOT smell like coffee at all. I  reluctantly drank half of it anyway because I hate complaining at restaurants, because who knows what they might do back in the kitchen!

2016-08-11,1.0,"On Sunday, August 7th, my girlfriend and I decided to have a late dinner at Grand Lux Cafe in downtown Chicago near our hotel. Staff members at our hotel and also friends of ours recommended the restaurant for the quality of food and affordable prices. When we arrived to the restaurant, we were pleased by the cleanliness of the restaurant and the ambiance, perfect place for a date night. We were put on a brief wait which was not a problem for neither one of us. When we were escorted to our table, we were greeted by our server about 10 mins later. My girlfriend has been in the restaurant industry for 7 years so because of her, we have a lot of patience when we are out to eat. When our waiter arrived, he let us know he would be our server but we were not given a name. He was a tall older African American male with a close cut (bald). He asked if we wanted a beverage other than water and then came back about 5 minutes later with our water. He appeared to be discombobulated because he was talking to himself through what steps he needed to take next and also what tables he needed to take care of. It was quite obvious because we could hear every word. He came back about 5 minutes later and asked if we were ready to order. My girlfriend had a question and he answered it and then she needed a few extra minutes to decide on a new entrée. We waited about 20 minutes before he came back to take our orders. Needless to say, our service was less than impressive, which was disappointing because the establishment and food were both great. Despite the service I still left a 20% tip. The 20% tip was not the only thing I left. I also left my credit card that night in the book which is a very common thing to forget at a restaurant. The next morning, I realized my credit card was gone and immediately checked my account and called the restaurant. The manager let me know that no card had been turned in which was alarming because I knew my card was left there. They said I was welcome to call back later, but instead, I went up to the restaurant because I had a flight to catch that afternoon. The card was still nowhere to be found. A few hours later, the fraud department for chase gave me a call to confirm some suspicious purchases made on my card. It was clear the server helped himself to my funds because the purchases were at a nearby Starbucks and grocery store (Jewel Osco). Extremely upset at the situation, I contacted the manager to speak with him about the incident and was put on a 20-minute hold. I hung up, called back, and explained how I was just on hold for 20 minutes and this time the a manager came to the phone after 2 minutes. Upon answering, he assured me that the servers were honest people and always returned cards. He even told a story about a diamond bracelet and iPhone that were returned. It was clear the manager was protecting the criminal activity of his employee and was very insensitive to the situation. He then told me he would look into the situation and get back to me but did not take down any of my information. This showed me he had no intention to do anything about it. I am extremely appalled by the insensitivity and lack of concern showed by management. As an honest person, I would just like to warn all customers that plan on dining at the restaurant to make sure you are very careful to take your cards and belongings with you because there is a crook employed at Grand Lux Cafe in Downtown Chicago.",0.9765,0.821,0.108,0.07,0.4028604224058769

We ordered buffalo wings , chicken quesadilla and fried calamari. Buffalo wings and chicken quesadilla was ok. But the calamari was very salty. Never ate such salty calamari. Then the main dishes came out , two rib eye steak both were extremely salty it was uneatable. My garlic shrimp spaghetti was also salty. I didn't finished the dish. The manager came and took away the two ribeye dish and replace it. Meanwhile my wife food was still not here after I have finish mine. They bought us back two new ribeye steak. Both was on the medium rare side but we request medium. And finally my wife dish came. It was like 45 mins after we order it. Again this had to be the worst dining experience of my life.

2016-07-16,3.0,"This restaurant is huge and in a great location right off Michigan Ave. The wait-time was only 10 minutes on a busy Friday night which was great.  Let's start with the bad stuff first. The service was atrocious. Our waiter only spoke broken English, was hard to get a hold of, and ended up bringing out everybody's food at different times. For example, my fiance got her burger a good 20-30 minutes after everybody else got their entrees. We were all done eating our main courses by the time she got hers. With that said, the food was good. We came with a group of 5 and tried several different dishes between all of us. My pot roast had generous portions and very hearty even if the beef was a bit on the fatty side. Once my fiance did get her Korean sriracha burger, it was really good and cooked nicely. The calamari was crisp although the sauce was rather bland. I did not try the asian short rib tacos, but those who did said it was very good. The desserts are also very good and the portion size is HUGE. You can easily share it between 2-3 people and it truly is too big for one person to finish. The velvet cake was good. The beignets were just ok, I'm from New Orleans and these were not authentic. They put a layering of icing on it and made it taste more like a donut. All in all, it's a reasonable place for dinner.

Food: I got the cafe Wellington, medium rare but the first time around they delivered it claiming it was medium well, cut into it to see if it's worth the hassle of returning and waiting for a new dish and it was way overcooked, no pink and dry. The second time around the meat was cooked to my expectations BUT it was rendered inedible due to the incredibly salty sauce, not sure if that's their standard or some type of revenge thing because I sent my dish back, call me paranoid. My friend who loves salty food couldn't even chew it twice before spitting it out due to the saltiness. Fail.  Friend for the ribeye and for thirty or so bucks I'd expect somewhere close to perfection but her requested medium well went unheard and it went straight past well done to dry and nasty.  Only saving grace for the food were the sides, mashed potatoes were delicious but the onion rings were a bite of grease every time. On second thought, it's not a saving grace because how does one mess up mashed potatoes.  Overall: not coming back here, wanted to try the shortcake dessert but with the way things went didn't wanna disappoint myself any further. Also, they need more attentive staff.  2 stars for the mashed potatoes and unlimited bread.",0.9527,0.753,0.148,0.1,0.4187404346495256
2016-06-04,2.0,"I went here for lunch three weeks ago. I ordered the chicken and avocado salad and told them NO chips or peanut sauce in the salad...they did it anyway. When I told the waitress I didn't want the salad, she said I could come back again and have a salad on the house, which brings me to today's review... I ordered the southwest salad, which was decent. The portion is a good size for one person and it was full of flavor.  I would probably recommend the salad to someone coming here. The service was pretty terrible.  I waited 15 minutes just to have someone come to my table. The food took forever to come out and let's face it, it's a salad.  The waiter said it was very busy, which is why service is slow but seriously, I had to take a photo, which depicts 5 waitresses standing around talking to each other in the front!! That was the real reason the service was terrible. As for the end of the meal, when I mentioned that I came back to get the salad ""on the house"", I was told my the manager that they ""can't honor that because I didn't get a gift card the last time I was here.""  I think the food is probably 3 stars, but the atmosphere, service, and general failed attempts at accommodating their customers brings it down to 2 stars in my book.",-0.9525,0.878,0.025,0.098,0.5029938271604939

Our table was right in front of the large window facing Michigan Ave, which made for some very interesting people watching.  Overall, the meal and service were just mediocre. I ordered the pina colada and should've just got a soda instead. We both had the Salisbury steak with brown gravy and mashed potatoes. This was the only thing I enjoyed about the meal. My green beans and sautéed spinach were so bland that I didn't eat them at all, even after sprinkling some salt and pepper on to try to add some type of flavor. My mother said their bread was 'lousy', so I told her I'd include that in my review. It wasn't the best breadbasket I've had at a restaurant, but not the worst either. Dessert: I don't know why I keep ordering beignets outside of New Orleans. I think I only ate one of these. And the three sauces were unnecessary. She didn't like her strawberry shortcake; the shortcake was extremely hard. But the ice cream and strawberries were good. Service was just okay. They got very busy quickly.

I thinnk Grand Lux Cafe is part of the Cheesecake Factory family, but not exactly sure.  The decor is identical to Cheesecake Factory restaurants.  The restaurant makes good use of an old department store with an escalator leading up to the second floor restaurant.  The theme is exactly Cheesecake Factory, but the menu is totally different, much more eclectic. The Indo-European presence is strong, but even traditional American dishes are presented with a flare of distinction.   I tried the Buffalo Chicken bites.  American enough, eh?  But I've never tasted Buffalo Wings or tizers that were moist and not overpowering, but satisfied the Buffalo flavor you crave in your wings and appetizers.  Served with an outstanding homemade ranch they were delicious, and for $ 6.95 an outstanding value.  I also had a Hawaiian smoothie that I shared with my better half because it was too good NOT to share.   I would recommend the restaurant because of it's accessibility and price point in a crowed downtown Chicago market.  For visiting downtown Chicago, it's a stop worth the small wait.  It was a Saturday night for us, and we were not ignored...far from it.",0.995,0.733,0.225,0.042,0.5674603174603173

After the show, about 10:30 at night, we decided to come to the Grand Lux for a late dinner. Now, we had all been here once before and didn't have any problems. This time, however, was a bad experience all due to the poor service our waitress provided. When we walked in we heard a group of staff singing happy birthday to a guest and hoped that if we told our waitress it was my boyfriend's 22nd birthday, we could embarrass him. He ordered a drink and since he looks very young she asked for his ID. This was followed by the first of many innapropriate comments made by our waitress. When she first came back to ask for our order she sounded impatient and even had an attitude when we told her we needed a few more minutes. Once we ordered our food and within about thirty minutes we received it. The food was delicious and exactly what we needed. When we were all finished, she removed our plates. However, she threw everything on to one stack instead of making multiple trips and because of this she dropped a knife and it landed, you guessed it, right on my toe (I was wearing open-toed sandals). The silverware at Grand Lux is beautiful, but very heavy. I yelped because of the pain and surprise of it falling on my toe. Because of this, I still have a bruise on my toes 2 days later. The entire table heard it and so did the waitress, but she ignored it. Instead of apologizing or asking if I needed ice, she left the knife on the floor and walked away. She came back promptly with the check and boxes (which she half tossed at us instead of handing them to us), not even asking if we wanted dessert. We asked for the dessert menu and also asked if they had anything for Birthdays. She told us no (which we knew wasn't true) and then went to retrieve the menu. When she came back we decided and then told her. Once we received our desserts, she gave us 15 minutes to eat them. After the 15 minutes, she came and took our plates away without even asking if we were finished. In case you were wondering, there was still food left on all the plates and my boyfriend even still had his spoon in his hand. She quickly returned to drop off the new check and only returned to pick it up.  We were going to ask for the manager, but we were tired and just wanted to leave the restaurant. While there I noticed we weren't the only ones receiving poor service in this woman's section. I hope this waitress is fired or learns how to properly work in the service industry.  If anyone is wondering, my boyfriend received squat recognition for his birthday and we didn't even receive a free dessert.

It's an upscale Cheesecake Factory, literally; I think they're the same company. Be prepared to wait. They don't take reservations, but you're welcome to hangout in the lobby or at the bar. They used to give you a pager, not sure if they still do. Now they just text your cell phone, which is convenient. And it's usually fast. The menu is diverse, so it's a comfortable and 'safe place' to bring first dates, out-of-towners, or large groups, because there is something for everyone. I absolutely love their BLT sandwiches. They use the best tomatoes, fresh, ripe, and bright red. The bacon is thick-cut and delicious. I've also had the pot roast. It's pretty good and the fish -n- chips are alright. Their soups are usually great, especially their tomato soup and their tortilla soup, but they're not always on the menu. Seasonal or Specials only. The seating can be hit or miss. It's a huge place, so sometimes you're seated right next to that 'weird couple,' another group's party, children dropping things, or, at other times, a private booth. Sadly, however, I've never got to sit in the awesome bay window area. I'm not sure how lucky people get those prime seats! Lastly, I adore, love, their homemade chocolate chip cookies.

2016-03-28,4.0,"It made 3 visits to this restaurant before writing this review. I didn't really appreciate the calibre of this place until I brought my my sister and her fiance (Austrian) for memorable Chicago dining experience. The first warning I gave to my guests - the portions are HUGE! Not Texas big, but if you are accustomed to portion sizes from Europe or Canada, you may want to split a meal, or anticipate carrying a doggy bag when you are finished, depending how hungry you are. We ordered the Asian chicken salad, duck triangles, turkey burger. I enjoyed the salad by myself. It had a healthy quantity of chicken, not over dressed with salad dressing. Every bite has a chicken piece with it until it was finished. After walking downtown Chicago for 6 hours, I appreciated the size of the dinner potion. My sister and her Fiance shared their Turkey burger. Her feedback: the best turkey burger she has ever tasted next to her own. Often, these burgers tend to be served dry when ordered in most restaurants. This turkey burger was very moist with the original juices remaining, so it wasn't overcooked. The duck triangles were very small (4 of them), but since it was tapas size, it was expected. It was very crispy without lots of residual oil. There was a nice blend of meat and seasonings with each bite into the triangles. Dessert time... we ordered the bread pudding, original cheesecake, and box of the made to order chocolate chip pecan cookies. None of the 'serts disappointed. My Austrian guests noted it was the best cheesecake he ever tasted. It was described as rich and light, while melting in his mouth into a silky cream! My sister's bread pudding was melt-in-your-mouth experience. My chocolate chip cookies took the longest to make and be delivered to the table. My only mistake: not ordering 2 boxes. My intention was to eat a few at the table, then carry and eat the rest on the way home. Needless to say, I waxed off the dozen cookies too quickly, wanting more. If we had time, I would've waited another 20 minutes for second batch. They were that good! The service was great. Even though we showed up at peak dining hours on Saturday night, we were invited to sit at the bar. Here is a suggestion: if you don't have small kids, dining at the bar rather than the main seating area will get you seated and served quicker. Even though we sat down relatively quickly, it did take a few moments to get the attention from the serve in the bar area (it was peak dinner time!). The wait was short that evening, compared to waiting 75 minutes to be seated in other nearby restaurants. The final bill was apparently very reasonable. Given the quality of the food and the atmosphere we enjoyed our meal in, my guests mentioned that they are charged the same price for Chili's caliber of food when dining in Canada, or in Europe. They said they received a LOT of value for that they paid for. In my opinion, yelp should rate this as a 3-star restaurant, not a 2-star. The price, service and quality of food deserves it.",0.9952,0.867,0.11,0.022,0.53096926713948

We had no problem waiting a hour. After about a hour they told us we would have to wait another 30 min. We agreed to wait the extra 30 min.  When we went back to the counter after our pager didn't go off within 30 min we asked how much longer. The lady at the counter told us we had another hour wait after we were told 30 min   I explained to the lady we were here at 5pm and she told us we weren't and that we were there at 6pm. I then showed her the ticket from the valet with the time stamp and she gave us an attitude  I then asked to speak to a manager who told me that told us he couldn't do anything for our wait. We were then told that it could be another 1-2 hours.  We finally got seated after speaking to 2 managers at 7:40pm. I asked the manager for some type of accommodation for the attitude we got from the staff and all the time we had to wait after the hour they told us and the manager Mohammed told us he would not do anything for our inconvenience. I find this in acceptable especially because we called ahead to make sure it was no problem and also we were promised only a hour wait when we walked in.

The decor is similar to that of Cheesecake Factory, as is the menu.  There is a decent parking garage 0.1 mile away (ROW self parking, $11).  I am not one to complain about the service often, I'm pretty low maintenance on that front.  As long as my drink doesn't get empty and stay that way forever... or at least come check on me at least once in case I forgot something, I'm pretty much good.  I ordered water with lemon, I received no lemon.  I asked for the lemon, I got a look as if I could have asked for this before. Erm, ok. Food came out in a reasonable amount of time and I really liked mine (Belgian waffle with strawberries). It was fresh and tasted very good.  My friend didn't care for hers, an egg white omelette with vegetables and hash browns.  The egg whites were cooked separately (plain), then folded over the vegetables (sort of like a blanket around them).  She said it wasn't very good overall.  After we received our food, the server was nowhere to be found. She then walked by 2 times so quickly, I couldn't grab her attention. All I wanted was some water (it had been empty for a while) and some jelly for the bread (it was served in a basket, with butter only).  By the time she came back a while later, we were done eating and took the check.  I think this experience would have been much better, if we had a different server. She just seemed generally disenchanted overall and had a less than friendly demeanor. I don't need Mary Poppins, but just a bit of attentiveness and a decent attitude would have been sufficient. I'm 50/50 on this experience on whether or not I'd recommend it, but I'd rather go somewhere else if I'm ever in the area again.",0.9478,0.878,0.099,0.023,0.5243371943371944

We decided to sit at a high top in the bar area to eat.  We were ignored for quite awhile, no water, no utensils, no greeting from a staff member. Luckily, Jay stepped in and took care of us even though his section was in another area of the restaurant.  We all had Bloody Marys all around which came super spicy or mild.

My honest evaluation is that the food here is basic at best.  I had an Asian Chicken Salad which is super simple to put together and truly only gets fancy with the dressing.  The variety served here is clearly something that I could find at Target so it was nothing special.  I also ordered a Broccoli Cheddar Soup and that was a mistake.  It was not tasty at all. The first is that they pulverized all the broccoli in a blender so there is very little texture or fun happening here.  There isn't a distinct cheese flavor at all, but it's yellow still and they try way too hard by putting a large piece of broccoli in the middle of the bowl.  The presentation was cute, but all the salt and pepper in the world wasn't helping this soup. I have made my own Broccoli Cheddar Soup before, it wasn't difficult and it was a lot more tasty. The worst thing about this place and the reason why I certainly will not return is that my table wasn't clean and my waiter looked dirty.  We were the first to be served for the day as they open at 11 for lunch and I was outside before the doors even opened.  His apron, black shirt and even his pants were clearly dirty.

(Came with a group of 16 on new years and was seated in an hour) -decor makes this place feel fairly classy for the level of dinning.  -Service was excellent (probably just because our specific server was friendly, attentive and accommodating) not sure this will happen with every visit Cons: - the food is so ehhhh I can't express the level of dinning purgatory I experienced. And really what do we go to restaurants for if not the food.  With such a large selection of items and the quantity of patrons coming through daily, its obvious where the problem lies.

You walk into a lobby and take the stairs up to a huge second floor with multiple dining rooms. Grand Lux is owned by Cheesecake Factory and the interior is evident of this, but there are almost no cheesecakes featured on the menu. Everything I've had here is great and done well. The portion sizes are decent and they bring complimentary bread to your table. The service is excellent and they check on you very often. If you sit in the round dining room upstairs the view of Michigan Avenue is great. My only complaint was the noise levels and during the summer the dining room is freezing.

Our experience today was horrible to say the least and not how I wanted to spend breakfast before my trip. I don't even know where to begin... The booths and chairs are completely torn and look beaten up with scratches and stains everywhere! The entire set of plates and glasses we got were disgusting as if they hadn't been washed. I was convinced that my tea cup actually hadn't been washed before it was given to me because it had lipstick and what looked like jam or syrup on the side of it. I returned the tea cup and got a mimosa instead and even that glass was sticky and grimly!! We were both completely disgusted! On top of that the waiter never came by to check on us once!  Also never get their ""Omletes"". They don't actually serve Omletes. It's more like an egg pancake which they lazily just put all the ingredients inside and cover the top like a taco or something! I was pretty upset when I got it and the eggs had no taste whatsoever and had the consistency of hard rubber. This place is WAY over priced for the quality of its food and service!

I have never ordered eggplant in my life, and the waiter brought us these on accident and said if we didn't like them, she'd bring us what we originally ordered. Needless to say, we didn't send them back, and we keep returning to Grand Lux for these again and again.  The menu is extensive, but nothing quite steals the show like the eggplant fritters. I had the edamame today, it was nice, although a little sweet. We also enjoyed the sauce with the fried pickles. I like to stick to the small plates, and wish there were a bit more non-fried options to enjoy.  The lackluster menu items: pot roast fries and the Bloody Mary. The pot roast tasted old/microwaved and I'm not a fan of their Bloody Mary mix. The kale salad was good if you love kale. If you're just trying to trim your waistline as I was, I'd recommend another salad option because it's A LOT of kale.  Overall, you will wait a really long time for average food and sometimes slow service. Just order 5 plates of the eggplant fritters, and it will be totally worth the wait and hassle! If you venture away from the small plates, my husband likes their sandwiches. He had a Cuban today which he enjoyed.  I'd recommend getting a perimeter table by the window.

I went there around brunch time with my friends. I ordered an omelette off of the lunch menu because I usually order pastas. My two friends got their orders on time, and I had to wait a long time. Our waiter did not come by us to check on us, or to check if I got my omelette. It was until they were almost half-way done with their food, we decided to ask another waiter walking by to call our waiter. He was surprised that I didn't get my order. Which is weird, because being our waiter, aren't you supposed to be checking up on my order? Soon after, the manager came to our table to tell us that my omelette had been ""flying tables"" because they couldn't figure out whose order it was- Very unprofessional. She offered to compliment the waiting time with a soup or salad, and I asked if I can get some fries and she also said she put my order in again and is expediting it. She brought the fries right away. It still took a while for me to get my omelette. When I got it, It was cold. It didn't seem fresh and I didn't like it at all. I didn't bother eating it and put it on the side. I was basically full anyway from munching from my friends' foods and the fries. Not to mention, I was supposed to receive fries with the omelette on top of the fries the manager brought me and I didn't. The waiter noticed my plate sitting on the corner of the table so we told him why I wasn't eating it and he apologized and offered to put in another order but at that point I didn't want to. Another manager came by and he apologized and was offering to get me something else but I didn't care to have something at that point.  They didn't charge us for the omelette or the molten lava cake. I was splitting the bill with one of my other friends, and our waiter charged my card twice. Simply unprofessional and not attentive.

Just like everybody says, it's like a slightly more upscale version of the Cheesecake Factory (minus the enormous cheesecake menu) as they're both from the same company of course. We visited 3 times on our visit to Chicago and always had a great experience. Service ranged from good to excellent, just depends on who you get. They're also very helpful in taking special preparation and dietary requests. My sister is vegan so we would often share the Vegetables as a Meal which is really delicious, and she requested for the veggies not to be cooked in butter and they gladly accommodated. The hummus and pita bread is also vegan, so the last two dishes I mentioned make a great vegan meal, enough to share between two people. Not to forget the complimentary bread at the start, which is warm, soft and fresh with a crunchy crust - SO good. The standouts for me were the desserts. The Warm Butter Cake is AMAZING. Oh my goodness. It has a crunchy sugary coating and is soft, fluffy and sweet. Not overwhelmingly buttery at all. Goes beautifully with the vanilla ice cream and strawberries. Their apple pie is also just delicious! Well-baked apples and the pastry is just wonderful. So crispy, flaky and with a crunchy caramelised sugary finish. It's massive though! Enough for 2, even 3 people. Last to mention is the opulent-looking interiors and comfy seating which always make the experience more enjoyable.

To my surprise my party of 7 witnessed one come out from between the seating. The busboy came out and killed our 'uninvited guest'. After which the young man said- 'your good now'-!!!?? Needless to say we exited. The manager made arrangements for my parking validation. However, any quality establishment would have at least offered gift cards to encourage us to return. Instead management behaved as if impervious to our dilemma.  We where there to celebrate a wedding anniversary of some friends who had there reception at the same location 12 years ago to the date of our visit 11/1/15.",0.8419,0.754,0.155,0.091,0.46388888888888896
2015-10-31,4.0,"From the creators of The Cheesecake Factory comes the Grand Lux Café, a restaurant that will definitely remind you of The Cheesecake Factory.  With hundreds of items on the menu, it may take a while before you can actually place an order.  The décor is upscale and classy (and very golden).  The service was good and they made no fuss about having separately checks.  I came on a Friday night and didn't have to wait for a table, even though the restaurant was quite full. Ahi Ceviche $7.50 - Good appetizer, big enough to share with 4 people. Chicken Lettuce Wraps $12.50 - The chicken is cooked with chopped up vegetables, topped with crispy noodles and served with 6 large pieces of iceberg lettuce.  It is good for sharing and I can only eat about 2 wraps at a time before I'm tired of them. Turkey & Brie Sandwich $12.95 - Good combination of flavors!  It also comes with a side. The restaurant is located next to Marshalls and TJMaxx.  Spot Hero found me parking a couple of blocks away for $12.",0.9686,0.809,0.154,0.037,0.596031746031746

Spread some butter and enjoy. 2) The dessert menu is very big too and won't disappoint you.

With dim lighting, large booths, an extensive menu, and quality food for a reasonable price, I make sure to always dine here when I'm strolling down Magnificent Mile, shopping bags in hand.

Beware and be #blessed that the entrees come in quite large portions. Some of my favorites include the burgers, chicken lettuce wraps, Brie & Turkey sandwich, and barbecue salmon. Seriously- very good food. The chocolate molten cake is a good way to top off the evening- or head to the Ghirardelli store down the street for an even better chocolate fix.  Four stars only because we ordered a burger ""well-done"" and had to send it back because it was pink, however delicious once we got it back. Our server was nice but perhaps his first day on the job.

Food: I had the warm goat cheese salad and the crispy caramel chicken.  The salad was small but delicious and the goat cheese was warm and melted in my mouth.  The chicken was slightly on the oily side but the caramel sauce worked well and the chicken was crispy on the outside and tender in the inside.  I also tried the pasta that one of my vegetarian friends ordered and it tasted phenomenal.      Grand Lux Café immediately sets a high standard with its classy feel and lives up to that standard with its service and food.",0.9853,0.837,0.156,0.007,0.5573076923076922

Downside would be that oftentimes (mid-dinner) they'll switch waiters/waitresses which, on numerous occasions, has caused a mistake in our orders and has thrown off the experience.

2015-07-14,4.0,"A friend has been raving about this place for 3 years so I finally got the chance to check it out. It's located on Michigan Ave, so its hugeeeeee seating area could be to accommodate the potentially many hungry shoppers/tourists/locals. We came here after church, and although there were already a lot of people eating, we didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes to be seated. We got pretty lucky and sat by the window! I am a big fan of natural lighting, and we got to people watch as we looked over the menu. Our waiter was really friendly, but he kept forgetting about the bread (he said he'd bring it out three times before it actually made it to our table). Also because it was during lunch hour, we switched waiters halfway through so our first guy could take a break. When the food came out, it didn't look like too much but it's actually a hefty portion. My friend got the Grand Lux Burger Melt, which was probably the best out of the 4 dishes we ordered. I ordered the Eggs Benedict. The toast that the ham and eggs were on was tasty. I got a side of fruit, but it came at an extra charge. Our waiter didn't make that clear, so make sure you double check. Everything was delicious, but extremely dense. We didn't realize it until after we finished, so I would definitely recommend only eating half and packing the rest because you MUST save room for dessert! We ordered the New Orleans beignets and the chocolate molten cake. You HAVE to order the cake! It is a chocolate lover's dream. The center is just warm enough to keep the rest of the cake delicious and the coolness of the ice cream balances it out. The beignets are fun to try if you've never had them before. 8 fluffy fried balls of dough come out with three dipping sauces (chocolate, vanilla, and my favorite raspberry). We had to power through and finish those desserts, but it was well worth it.

While I am not always a kale fan if I could have this salad I might just consume kale daily.  From the menu: Kale and Avocado Salad Fresh Kale, Avocado, Spicy Roasted Poblano Chiles, Black Beans, Feta Cheese, Onions and Toasted Pumpkin Seeds with Citrus Vinaigrette.  chopping the generally course leaves makes all of the difference during consumption then topping it with delicious + more delicious.... grrrreat, now I'm salivating. After the salad I enjoyed the Memphis ribs which were good but no Rendezvous (let's be real, nothing ever will be) the real star on the plate was the corn bread which might just be the best I've ever eaten.  Too bad there was not more of it because before I realized what I was doing it was gone!  My party ordered the beignets and while pleasant I'm told the are no Café Dumond, I preferred the tart berry sauce they were served with.  A few days later my group returned for dessert.  I consider myself a créme brulee conisourre, when it is on the menu I order it!  So, I did just that.  Grand Lux knows how to make a satiny smooth custard where they went wrong was when they carmelized the classic  sugar top before I ordered my dessert.  # fail The service during both visits left something to be desired.

I usually order the pot roast and mashed potatoes and have not been disappointed.  The salmon served on the plank was quite good, too. Very flavorful.  They serve warm sour dough and grain bread but miss the whipped butter with it--our butter was frozen solid and could not be spread.   Desserts are displayed and all look delicious.  We are usually too full to order any, but enjoyed the carrot cake last time. Our only complaints are that 1. the lighting at some of the tables is too dark to read the very small font used in the menus (waiter had no flashlight-we downloaded an app) and 2. the tables for two are sometimes shoved together to accommodate a big party and then the two tops that are left on either side are very close to the big party. A couple cannot carry on a conversation next to a large group that thinks that because they are in a group they can talk and laugh as loud as though they were at home.  I would applaud any restaurant that had the gumption to shush a group that is drinking, too loud, and disturbing others.

It is a burger and a beer, seriously. On top of that once the order was correct I had to wait even longer because he said they were out of fries. In the middle of lunch service, where half of your items come with fries, you're telling me you ran out? What horrible mismanagement in the kitchen allowed that to happen? I would have spoken to a manager if I thought it would have helped but considering the unbelievable rudeness and incompetence I had encountered among the various staff members thus far I figured the management was probably just as bad if not worse.  Overall, I would never, ever come back. Not even on a dare. Not even if it was free. Maybe if you paid me AND the food was free. Stay away from this nightmare.

2015-05-28,4.0,"I've been hearing about the Grand Lux Café for quite some time. My significant other loves this place. So while in the Chi over Memorial weekend we decided to go. We arrived around 6pm which is smack dab in the middle of dinner time. But let's keep it 1-hunnid (hundred) there is no such thing as not crowded or ""the best time to go to avoid the crowd"" in the Chi; and that is one reason why I love this city! It's full of life!  Once we were able to valet and go inside we were told it would be about 2-2.5 hours for a table. We were a party of 10 and it's ""summa time in the Chi"". I didn't expect anything less. With Grand Lux being right off the Magnificent Mile I could care less. By the time I hit Burberry, Forever 21, Louie and Garrett's the 2 hour wait was over!  My s.o. said he wished we had dined earlier so that I could see the architectural detail in the presence of the sunlight. What I was able to see was still beautiful. The décor has tons of character and the environment was lively.  We had the funniest server I've ever had. He was quick and personable. My food (I had a steak and baked potato) was delicious. My s.o. had lemon chicken which was also very tasty. I was too stuffed for dessert but his Butter Cake and ice cream (that I sampled) was also good. My ONLY complaint is the size of the restroom. This place can easily seat 400 people but the restroom only have 4 stalls and 3 sinks. Uh, that's not a good look for the ladies.

I am considering going back, but mainly for desert.  They had a nice large display case that was very tempting.  The rest of the menu is okay, but I think their deserts really stand out.  A friend recommends the omelets and salads, but I wouldn't pay high prices for food that I can easily make at home.",0.9861,0.78,0.158,0.062,0.5218996960486321

2015-03-14,1.0,"Shame on them. They are a chain and they won't invest money to train their waiters to be simply polite. Not asking for more: just don't be rude/unpleasant. They embarrassed me when i had the terrible idea to take there my brother staying  here for 2 days and who was shopping on michigan ave. it was tuesday 2pm and i thought: well let's try that one. Just 10 tables were busy, that's all. He was waiting for me and when i arrived, i asked FOUR different waiters (come on, at least ONE must have dealt with him already since he had been there for an hour before i arrived!): ""can you tell me where i can find a young man sitting by himself at a table?"". What do you think they responded ? ALL their responses were rude. NOT ONE exception. i was shocked. Soooooo unprofessional. The blond girl hardly turned her head and mumbled a vague answer sort of telling me ""hey, i dont have time for you"". TEN TABLES were busy !!!! not more !! how hard is that ?? And then when i found him waving at me from behind a plant, i looked around and he was the ONLY man sitting at a table by himself. So it wasn't like they didn't know. They just didn't care. Professional waiters would walk WITH you trying to help you courteously.   The food: nothing special. Not bad, not very good, just average. The salad is as good as McDonald's $7 Southwest salad. Balsamic dressing is the same as the one i prepare at home. Bro always likes to taste the Carrot Cake at every restaurant in the USA. Well theirs wasn't impressive obviously since he didn't say anything (unlike Smith & Wollensky's, Beatrix's and Morton's Carrot Cake which he absolutely loves). So DO NOT go there if you are looking for particularly good food and DON'T believe the positive reviews on TripAdvisor which has been accused of review inauthenticity lately anyways (article on cnn). If you don't see Mich-ave day & night like i do, you will want to enjoy the seating by the windows. While seated, there was a number of dirty plates and glasses on the table. Do you think anyone bothered to take them away ? i had to request this twice from them.  Bro didn't make any comments but i knew what he was thinking, especially that he was coming from Europe and is only used to top notch places. Today, SATURDAY, i had a friend coming from the suburbs who insisted on going there because he saw online that the place looked ""kitch"". i thought ""ok, let's give this another try"", especially that they are a block away from me. i called them at 4:48pm and got a ruuuuuuuuuuuude girl (i bet it's the same white trash blond). i was asking her if we would find tables available if we come in at 7:30pm. Her response ? ""i didnt understand anything of what you just said. Repeat !""  ???????????????????????????? huh ????? i repeated slowly for her brain to process the information, and her response ? ""Yes we will have tables. You just need to wait"". Did this moron think i was asking if they OWNED tables and chairs ? The PROFESSIONAL response should have been ""i am sorry but today we are usually very busy, there will be a wait and we will be happy to accomodate you as soon as one is available"". BUT that's too much to ask when a restaurant hires hillbillies, undertrained white trash. THAT says a lot about the owners. To them, this is probably classy. i called later requesting to speak with a manager to finally complain of course after having made the decision not to EVER step again in this circus (btw the decor is of very poor taste, especially the colors). They put me on hold for 12 minutes. When someone finally came back, he said he was a waiter and didn't know why i was on hold""......................... :)",-0.8574,0.865,0.056,0.079,0.5707855937166282

For the one Saturday or Sunday morning we visited here, my roommate had an omelette with a side salad, and I stuck with the barbecue burger.  We also ordered a basket of beignets for the table as well since we were both feeling super indulgent that day.  Sadly both dishes for me (the burger and donuts) were just horrible, laden with grease and oil.  The first bite of the burger actually tasted pretty good because it was the first time I had a ground beef patty in awhile with onion rings and barbecue sauce on brioche, but by the time I was on my third or fourth bite I was absolutely done.  All of the grease had completely soaked the bun from head to toe and it was like eating a misshapen ball of lard.  That coupled with the taste of faux-beignets that were fried in old fryolator grease actually made me sick for the rest of the day.  I didn't try any of my roommate's omelette, but I saw a lot of brown spots which is a clear indicator the eggs were overcooked if not burnt. Grand Lux Cafe, I will not be back.  Your waiters are nice and the table bread is pretty good, but after one visit I was so sick I can't even bear the thought of ever returning.",0.9829,0.779,0.158,0.063,0.5653776683087027

To start, we had to wait for 30 mins to get a table, which was very reasonable for a table for two in a nice restaurant. Once seated, our server came and introduced himself but was rather off of his game since he didn't even bring us plates or anything. We didn't get our bread until later and once we did, it tasted pretty old. It was not even warm... and we still didn't have small plates for the bread. He brought them quickly but then he forgot our straws for our water... We finally got to order. I am a vegan so finding something was kind of hard. I asked him about two different pastas and he said that he would check but he didn't even let me know if they are vegan or not until he brought the plate... ummm like what if I had changed my mind about the pasta?! As for my friend, he quickly found something. He ordered Thai Chicken with rice (or something a long those lines). I ended up getting the Pasta Pomodoro without cheese. The food arrived quickly which was really nice but the quality of the food had dropped SOOO much since my last visit (a year ago). My pasta was nothing special at all and my friend said that his chicken was just plain out bad. I don't know but it just seemed to me that everything about our visit today was just so off. Also, our server kept on addressing my friend when asking the questions. He didn't even seem to really care about me...

2014-12-22,3.0,"This is a large-capacity restaurant on Michigan Avenue in Chicago. It is very similar to the Cheesecake Factory. The first and most noticeable characteristic about it is the setting. It's situated right in the heart of one of the biggest retail shopping areas in the country, so if you're looking for a quiet little out-of-the-way place to have an intimate meal, this probably isn't the place for you. It's a bit noisy, and the waiting area tends to fill up and become very crowded. In terms of the food, it's pretty good. I had the Sunday night pasta, which was a flavorful meat sauce over angel hair pasta.

They remade the meal with the biscuits being slightly warmer, but the eggs were cold. At this point, my family had finished their meals, so I stomached the food. That was a mistake, as I felt nauseous for several hours later. I let the manager know. By this time, my father-in-law had generously paid for breakfast.

2014-12-03,4.0,"How grand is the Grand Lux Café? The atmosphere at the Grand Lux Café was intimate, yet at the same time communal. The lights were dimmed so that the surrounding architecture in the dome area of the restaurant was pronounced. One of the nicest spots in the entire restaurant is the dome area. There are two person and four person booths, each seat covered in an elegant-velvet maroon fabric, surrounding the outer circle near the windows. The most charming aspect of sitting near the windows is the captivating view of Michigan Avenue. While enjoying your dinner, you can also enjoy the city lights.  All staff members were dressed in solid black apparel, with a silky-black apron wrapped around their waist. Although dressed alike, some carried smiles, while others lagged around with blank, rigid stares. My brother and I were lucky enough to get Jessica, who at first was dry, but slowly became friendlier throughout the night.  As any restaurant would, we were first offered drinks and given menus. Not only were the actual menus huge, but also the selection of food. The menu was organized in an orderly fashion with each heading containing a collection of cuisines. From appetizers, minis, bites and tapas, to burgers, sandwiches, grand salads, steak, and seafood, the array of food available was never ending.  After thoroughly searching the menu, we decided to order the buffalo chicken rolls and buffalo wings. During the short wait, we politely informed our waitress of the cold draft. She quickly apologized and offered us hot tea, any flavor, on the house. My brother replied with a smile, ""Wow, that would be great!""  We found this gesture from the waitress kind, professional, and a solution to the problem. While waiting for our appetizers, we were able to enjoy a fresh hot cup of grassy, yet sweet, green tea. Shortly after, our appetizers arrived. The strong and spicy aroma of the buffalo was too hard to resist. The crisp, peppery wrap was the perfect finishing touch to the sweet and salty buffalo chicken wrap.  Amid enjoying our appetizers, we ordered their famous ""Grand Lux Burger Melt"" to share. The burger arrived in perfect condition, hot off the stovetop and cooked to our liking, medium-rare. Not only was the meat cooked to our liking, but also the grilled parmesan cheese bread with lots of cheddar cheese and rich, lush grilled onions. The sharp taste of the parmesan and cheese fully covered the crispy brown bread. Overall, the combination of parmesan cheese, dressing, and meat was perfect. Furthermore, if it were not for being sufficiently filled, dessert would have been our next and last course of the tasteful night. However, this was not my first time at the Grand Lux Café, so I do recommend trying one of their richly tasting desserts.  There were a few minor moments during the night, like the cold draft, but all could be fixed. Also, the prices were slightly high. For example, the cost of a burger ranges from ten to fourteen dollars. However, the portions are big so sharing is a good option. Furthermore, for not having a reservation, a ten-minute wait was not bad at all; however, keep in mind this was on a Wednesday night around six. All in all, my brother and I were able to enjoy our night out together because of the lovely service, exquisite atmosphere, and savory cuisine. I speak for us both when I say to definitely make a visit to the Grand Lux Café.",0.9993,0.771,0.217,0.012,0.5991767068273095

Eventually the food came, and our original waiter came by.  He offered us a dessert as consolation, but we didn't want a dessert.  No adjustments were made to the bill. Oh--the food.  Not good.  The chopped salad was lackluster, which wa a huge disappointment.  I've had the salads here before and they were much better.  My meatballs tasted like something from Potbellies.  My friends salmon was overcooked and my husband's stir-fry--when he finally got it--had very tough and chewy beef.

2014-11-20,4.0,"I had always seen the gigantic Grand Lux Cafe looming over Michigan Avenue, but had never been until last weekend. I know many out of towners that love to go when they are in the city, which kind of turned me off from this place. I tend  to try and avoid the crowds and tourist traps as much as I can! However, after seeing the line at the new Shake Shack around the corner on Sunday, and not wanting to stand in the freeeeezing cold and wind only to fight for a table, my sister suggested GLC. The place is pretty cool inside, and I can definitely see why my out of towners (especially those with kids) would like this place. It LOOKS like a super fancy Olive Garden, but like, 100 times larger and with great views of Michigan Ave. The decor is extreme and gaudy and kind of tacky, but it is also kind of cool at the same time.  Anyway, as suspected, we were seated immediately even though the entire like 700 person dining room seemed full and we came in at the same time as several others. We ordered drinks and an appetizer from our very sweet and friendly server.  The menu is HUGE. This would be a great place to come with a group when you know there are some picky eaters-everyone can find something they like here.  The drinks I tried were the Grand Lux Margarita and some cocktail with prosecco and hibiscus that my sister ordered. Both were great - especially the margarita. One of the best I've ever had. The prosecco drink was very pretty and good, but too sweet for my tastes. My one complaint with the drink menu was that there are no prices listed, and when we asked our server she didn't know, just gave us a price range. Knowing that we were downtown, we expected to pay maybe $11-12, but turned out they were more like $14. Not a huge deal, it just feels kind of expensive compared with the rest of the menu. We had the Asian nachos for an appetizer which were delicious. Whoever thought to deep fry some wontons and pile other goodies on top - props! Everyone at my table ordered burgers and unfortunately I didn't get to try anyone else's before they scarfed it down! I got the classic burger - called the grand lux burger maybe? It was amazing. Perfectly cooked and diner style. MmmmMMmmm. The fries were also delicious. Overall, it was a very good experience. I don't think I'll be back here much if ever again, but definitely WAY better than I expected! And of course the bread they bring out....so amazing!

So I went here for the 1st time with some friends a few years ago for my 21st bday and was staying at the intercont'l hotel down the street the day after halloween this year w/ one of my girlfriends and we went around 11:30.  Seated swiftly and it was busy on that saturday. We are greeted by the friendly male waiter, we get our waters and order our main dishes with apps. I wanted the crispy calamari (which I pointed to on the menu) and buffalo chicken rolls w/ bleu cheese. Remember that. We wait and wait, but we were patient because we can see it's busy. I ask my friend, ""Are we going to get bread or anything?""  ""We're supposed to.."" We look around at other tables who are munching their bread happily, thinking maybe they'll bring it with the apps? We get the apps first and they set mine down. A salad in the center with calamari pieces dancing around it sparsely. I stopped the girl who set the plate down and say, ""Oh, uh.. I wanted the crispy calamari?"" ""Yeah! This is it!"" Me: ""Ahhh, oh.. okay."" I look to my friend and she's puzzled as well. Our waiter stops by and asked if everything is okay. Me: ""Uh.. this is the crispy calamari?"" Him (face falls in realization): I thought you said salad?? Me: ....no. Just calamari. Him: I'm so sorry, I repeated it back and I thought- Me: You know what? It's okay. I'm starving, I haven't eaten for about 36 hours now. F*** it. I'll just eat the calamari. Him: Alright...I'm so sorry. DId you want marinara?  Me: Yes, please. Him: And just to let you guys know, _________ is going to be taking care of you, I'm just helping her out. Us: Okay. I ate the pieces and tried the salad but couldn't stomach it, it had a strange dressing. Our mains come along with our ""real"" waitress. She was nice, saying she was told about the mix up. We start eating and I notice buffalo sauce for the chicken rolls was EXTREMELY low. The only reason I said nothing is because anytime you ask for another sauce anywhere, they give you their entire supply for 6 rolls and I hate being wasteful. But they gave me a large bowl of bleu cheese, I just ate it. They were really good, nice flavor and kick I wasn't expecting. My friend to the waitress: may we have more water? Her: Ooh, I don't know if we have any pitchers, let me try and find you one. ??? Our waitress comes again midmeal, I order the warm brownie sundae, no whip, since I saw the warning to put the request for desserts in early. Finish the buffalo rolls in 15 mins and we wait. And wait. Waited 50 minutes until they bring it out. It's super cold around the edges, I spoon into it with the ice cream and it tastes like batter in the center. my friend: how is it? me: it..doesn't taste done. She tries it and agrees. The waitress comes over about 5-7 mins later, asking how is it. I told her it doesn't seem done. Her: Ohhh, no. It is, this is how it's supposed to be. softer in the center Me:   :| Her: Yeahhh... did you..want it more cooked? Me: if possible, yes? She took it, brought the plate back and it's actually a hot plate with a cooked brownie. Tasted very good! We get the check and I realize that.. I was charged for the salad, even though I explained that I was starving and I will just eat the calamari. Which the male waiter said he understood but, didn't communicate this to the waitress. I tell her I didn't even want the salad, she kind of got an attitude and took the bill back, my friend signed for hers and my bill came back with the ORIGINAL order of crispy calamari. I signed and we left. I take fault in saying the calamari & salad can stay, but when hunger strikes after almost a full two days of not eating and having a lot to drink the night prior, also knowing the calamari would take who knows how long to come back? I didn't care at that point. Food was good, but the service was eh. They were nice, but that was it for me.

Grand Lux is your typical American food with some Asian, Latin, and Italian flare.

For dessert...you HAVE to get the beignets!!!! Put in that order when you order your dinner as it takes 35 minutes to prepare.

The Rib tip filled grilled cheese sandwich was very good. I would recommend if you're in the area and off-hours. We had lunch on a Sunday afternoon at 3pm.

The reason why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the hostess that greeted us upstairs by the escalator. Now I work in the customer service business and I know how this should have went but instead this is what happened. We went upstairs and there were people in front of us so she assisted them and now it was out turn, but she didn't acknowledge us so we just kind of stood there like we were a burden to her, finally when she noticed us she just said how many. I'm sorry but a ""hi how are you"" would have been nice. This is a nice place right on Michigan ave. how is this girl working in customer service???? If you hate your job find another one that's all (preferably not in customer service) but anyway when we said yes for 3 people she just mumbled something and pointed us to our left. All 3 of us being confused, we just stood there looking at each other not knowing what we were supposed to do. Thankfully a very nice and professional gentleman guided us to our table. Once we sat down our waiter was with us within minions, his name was Andre and he was awesome! I wish more places had people like him. He helped us pick out our food and made sure we were doing good throughout our meal! He was a very attentive waiter! He boxed our food for us because the portions are ginormous.

I have been coming to Grand Lux for years now, and over these few years everything has changed. I really am not the type to right something bad about any business, but really this was embarrassing!  First, our waiter didnt show up for a long time, so long that once the waiter did show up we knew what we wanted to drink, have for appetizers, have for dinner, what we would like for dessert, and our coffee. Second, after we did order, the food took forever! I could have waited, but my friend was starving from waiting so long and now the food. Third, when we did get our food, it was not cooked right! Really? Grand Lux?? I was just over it at this point, but then we decided to give it another go with dessert and coffee, oh my goodness, a cup of coffee took another 20 min just to bring out, and when we did get it, it seemed like they had spilled coffee and poured it back into the cup... I know I sound bratty, but when you want to go to a nice place to eat, and you think of Grand Lux, you really want the service to be up to par, but its not the same anymore.

It looked like the go-to place because of the Magnificent Mile view that can be seen.  This place definitely reminded me of The Cheesecake Factory! The variety of the menu was a definite reminder. Nothing particularly stood out on their menu, but I had their samosas and the Shrimp Fra Diablo Pasta - both were good. My boyfriend had the Shaking Beef* and Caramel Chicken - this definitely is an Americanized Chinese dish - this was okay. He had also ordered a beer but the wrong beer was brought out to him. This got taken away and tossed out instead of letting him finish it and not charge us for the other. This had shocked me. Why would you take away the drink that was partially drank and toss it out without asking if we want what was ordered.  It was confusing, at first, because we were first timers and there wasn't a crowd of people waiting outside for us to locate the entrance, but we made our way. Window seat above Michigan Ave was popular! - we weren't able to get a seat overlooking Michigan Ave, but we did get window seats by Ohio Street.

2014-07-20,4.0,"I've been bringing my out of town friends to Grand Lux for the past couple of friends. No, I dont think it is a representative of ""authentic Chicago food"" (be it the pizza, hot dog, italian beef etc.), but I do think the food is solid and the atmosphere is good for groups. Most recently, we went to grand lux on sunday a little after noon and waited for around 15 minutes for a table to open up for 6. They seated us even though there were only two of us there at the moment. When our party was up to 4, we found out that the other two people had their metra delayed and would be fairly late. The server took this information in stride and still provided us with attention as we waited for the rest of our party. As for food, we split an order of the asian nachos, which was enjoyed by most of our party. The nachos were different from traditional nachos, and resembled more of a deep-fried wonton skin. The nachos are dressed with chicken, a light wasabi mayo, nuts, greens,  and a sweet peanut sauce. I would recommend these if your party wants a sweet+savory appetizer. For my entree, I ordered the pasta carbonara. The portion was large enough so that I only ate half of it. The sauce itself was a little too heavy and salty after a while, but I still enjoyed it for the most part. For dessert, we shared the obligatory beignets, which were outstanding as usual (note that they opt for more of a glaze over the powdered sugar).  Overall I would characterize Grand Lux's food as generally having tons of flavor. However, it might sometimes be a little to sweet or too salty for some people ( but thats also how some people like their food). The service has always been good for me as well, and I will look to return in the foreseeable future.",0.9967,0.782,0.199,0.019,0.5353543743078626

We were seated almost immediately and like many other reviews have stated, Grand Lux is very similar to The Cheesecake Factory. They offer a wide variety of food and everything is slightly overpriced, but when you're downtown what isn't, right? I ordered crispy calamari and a tomato and mozzarella mini pizza, one co-worker ordered a salad, another ordered fries, and the last ordered Alfredo fritters. Everything was so-so outside of the Alfredo fritters. My friend who ordered it did not enjoy it because it had the consistency of fried cod, which I initially was disbelieving about but after trying a bite, I had to agree. The calamari was decent and the mini pizza could've gone with far less grease along the crust. Our waitress was attentive and apologetic about the disappointment my friend felt regarding the Alfredo fritters. She even offered to take it back but we were all pretty tired from a long work day so my friend politely declined. Overall, this is a great place for out-of-towners to dine at.

I guess pushing the issue might have worked, I just didn't have the ambition to beg and was more hopeful that the staff would remember my friends birthday, which they completely forgot. Not at all surprised. Getting drink refills, not at this place. Patrons are waited on when their food arrives and that's about it, folks. Quite lax if you ask me. Either way, Grand Lux Café always seems to play the part well of a clueless dingbat, pedestrian chain restaurant.  We had Southern Fried Chicken and Pasta with chicken, mushrooms and sundried tomatoes. Both entrees were tasty and bountiful. Portions are definitely not an issue here, as most dishes are quite generous. The chicken was a full half and will never be confused for a pigeon. Surprisingly, though, the breast and wing were definitely on the dry side, albeit edible. The peanut slaw and mashed potatoes were good. The pasta dish was rich and yummy. Although we took part of the meals home and most of the dessert, we had the red velvet cake and the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake. Nothing special, but both were definitely good.  If it were up to me, I probably would never return to this place. However, with a bunch of friends who think this joint is the be all, end all, I'm sure I'll be back.",0.9874,0.803,0.152,0.045,0.5991890959282266

The pie was put on order and because we had to wait, we also had some tea.   The tea was green tea with pomegranate.  It's was our first time and we enjoyed it.  Didn't expect that. The pie was very good, the only thing that prevented me giving a 5 out of 5 is that it was not 'out of the oven hot.'  The pie was exactly presented exactly how was suppose to be enjoyed with vanilla ice cream on top.

For the 2 of us, we had one of the best tables in the house at the window looking out over Michigan and Ontario.  This was the best part of our experience.  We ordered the Tuna appetizer.  I am not sure how they prepared this.  While the center was raw as expected, the outside was possibly seared but did not seem cooked in any way.  While the tuna was fine, it just looked very odd.  The dipping sauce (like everything else) did not have enough flavor. I ordered Chicken Piccata which did not have enough lemon or caper flavor.  The mushrooms had the texture of mushrooms from a jar and no flavor at all.  The chicken and pasta were well executed. My wife ordered the seafood salad with dressing on the side.  We had to ask 4 times and wait 10 minutes to finally get the dressing to the table after the meals arrived.  The salad was massive and overall was OK. The service was below what I would expect even at a large chain restaurant.  We actually had 2 waiters as one was ""on break"" when we arrived.  Both servers seemed to do one thing at a time.  They would come to the section, do one thing and then go back to the back for the next thing.  This led to very slow responses to any request.  Finally, a note on the valet service.  The price was very good at $15.  However, it took over 20 minutes to get our car when requested.  While a wait should be expected in this busy area they should make you aware to request your vehicle when you request your check, they both take about the same amount of time to settle.",0.9397,0.888,0.081,0.031,0.47263091846425176

I was puzzled since it wasn't that crowded, but ok. Ten minutes later some cold beignets arrived with my check. I thought surely they'd be comped since the manager seemed to be aware of the situation, but they were not. I paid the bill, and my receipt cane back without my card. After waiting 5 minutes to get my card back, the waiter finally found it on the floor. I had asked for the beignets to go since I couldn't wait to get out of there.

I've been here on three separate occasions with my girlfriend and with friends. The waiters have been nothing short of amazing. Each time was better than the next which was a big plus for me because some restaurants can lack in quality on a consistent basis.  For mini plates, I've tried Buffalo Chicken Bites, Spanish Chorizo and Cheese Croquettes (absolutely delicious) and BBQ Pork Sliders. All dishes were great. For entrees, I've tried the Memphis BBQ Ribs, Southern Fried Chicken (it really is half a free range chicken... there was enough for me to share and still be stuffed) and the Wood-grilled BBQ Burger. I recommend any of the 3, but if you like more ribs, I would suggest the BBQ Baby Back Ribs which is a lot more in quantity.  Going a little earlier for dinner (around 5-6) is a nice way to avoid a long wait and get a window seat (only takes about 15 minutes more).

We then learned that our waitress was some lady who had waltzed passed our table several times that evening as if she couldn't have been more unconcerned. Even after taking our drink order she was 'over it'. We ended up having to ask to be re-seated because after we complained of being ignored she kept giving me the side-eye and I gave it right back to her rude behind.  The reason I chose to focus on that in my review is because her attitude and behavior were hardly an aberration.

2014-03-04,3.0,"My husband & I went here to celebrate our 2-year wedding anniversary (this was the place he proposed to me on our 1-year dating anniversary). We asked for a booth near the window and the hostess took care of it w/enthusiasm. I LOVE when people are genuinely nice! Anyway, our drinks were quite tasty (I ordered the My Thai, and my husband had the Texas Tea). However, we were both pretty salty having decided to order from the ""Big Small Plates/Almost Big Plates"" section of the menu. We inquired about it to our waitress and she said the portions were the size of normal restaurant platings as Grand Lux plates are actually much more generous. Needless to say, those plates are what the name says, tiny. I ordered the Bistro Steak w/prime sirloin, cheese polenta, and hard brussel sprout leaves. And my hubby ordered the Sicilian pasta. When our dishes arrived... Let's just say both of us were finished in less than 10 mins. We were super disappointed that we didn't choose from the regular menu. It's just that the choices from that section sounded so good. My steak was a flat cut, sliced into 6 mini-bites (about the length of my middle finger), with about 1/4 cup of polenta. It was in fact delicious- but whyyy did it only have to be offered as a small plate?! Our waitress did humor us by drawing a very good, detailed picture of Iron Man on our receipt. She was quite the artist as it looked just like him!  Anyway, I am still a fan of Grand Lux--- we will just stay away from the Small Plates!",0.9873,0.843,0.14,0.016,0.5706267806267806

I swear the plates were twice the size of my face and could probably feed me comfortably for three dinners in a row. It's a great location to eat if you're shopping along Michigan Ave on a weekend and would rather not wait. We went on a Friday night and walked straight in around 6:30pm Entrees: We got.... Southern Fried Chicken - Came with giant pieces of fried chicken with mashed potatoes (fairly standard) and a peanut cole slaw which was pretty unique. This dish was a little bit too one dimensional for me but you can't really go wrong with fried chicken!   Chicken Jambalaya - Comes with peppers and onions in a spicy sauce with white rice on the side. (Also the option to add shrimp too). Alright, I was disappointed with this dish because it didn't taste like authentic jambalaya at all! It definitely would have benefited from some sausage, more creaminess, celery, and more spice!  Lemon Chicken Piccata - This was my sister's choice and I gave her major props for picking it. It was my favorite entree of the night. The pasta was like angel hair but just a tad thicker. It was served in a lemon cream sauce with capers, mushrooms, and artichokes and three huge pieces of chicken breast on top. I don't know what made this dish work, but everything clicked. From the tangy hint of lemon to the pickled flavor of the capers and the juicy, moist chicken....I couldn't stop eating it! I would return just to have this again (and then for two more nights thereafter with the leftovers).  I'm glad I gave Grand Lux a try. Our server was so friendly and sweet too.

HUGE menu ala the obvious Cheesecake Factory association.  Our server was very friendly, and upon request kindly pointed out a few of her favorites from the medium-sized items.   We ended up getting the Duck Triangles (very good, but only 4!) and Spanish Chorizo and Cheese Croquettes.  The croquettes were my choice and I was not impressed.  Not much spice to them at all, and they were basically just tater tots with cheese and fried.  Bread was available, but we were not offered a refill of it.  I got strawberry lemonade and everyone else at the table just got sodas. Entrees: 1) Pasta Carbonara w/ chicken (medium plate) 2)  BBQ Chicken (1/2 chicken with small order of fries and small cup of peanut cole slaw) 3) Kids Cheese Pizza 4) Kids Grilled Chicken (mashed potatoes and carrots) The Pasta Carbonara was good and it was a very large portion.  My wife ended up eating off of the leftovers twice.  The BBQ chicken was decent, but for what was supposed to be a ""big plate"" on the menu the portion sizes of the chicken and sides were pretty small.  The kids enjoyed both of their meals, and even ate most of them for a change. We ordered the beignets (8 in order) at the start of the meal because the baked desserts take about 30mins.  The kids got the Create Your Own Cupcakes.  There were 4 chocolate cupcakes with a variety of icings and sprinkles.  The beignets....well, they were awesome!  I tried to sneak a couple home with me but someone beat me to them in the leftover box. We ended up ordering a lot of food and paying about the same amount that we would have at any other casual restaurant, so no complaints on the price.  Service was great, even with me slugging down lemonade like usual.

I could see people thinking that it's kind of...kitschy...but it looked like the space was well cared for and I felt like I was walking into a new restaurant. We were able to sit in the front area, which is floor to ceiling windows. It was a wonderful view and I could see myself sitting in there all day. The service was pretty good, everything came out in a timely matter and our water glasses were kept full. The menu and portions here are HUGE. When I see a menu that large, it is hard for me to believe that everything on it is made well, especially with how eclectic this one was. I have to say, though, that everyone enjoyed their meal. Was it worth the price? No way. It was pretty straight forward and rather unimaginative food served in a very nice atmosphere and in large portions.  I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich, which I had just ordered a few days ago at the Gage. Here, the same dish cost more and didn't leave an impression on me. It wasn't bad, but the chicken was heavily breaded and the sauce was slathered on the bun and made it kind of soggy. The flavors stayed separate and made it taste rather generic. My two coworkers LOVED their dishes, however: carmel chicken (I think) and a seafood pasta. I probably wouldn't return for the food. Especially if I'm paying $13--I would price the food here closer to $8. However, I think this is a beautiful spot for shopping downtown and grabbing some food, especially if you happen to be with a group of people with a lot of different tastes. That is something a place like this is good for. There isn't a lot to say about the food itself, but with a menu that large there is something for everyone--and I could probably spend a long, slow afternoon sitting in that front room. Picturesque.

2014-01-15,1.0,"This is my 3rd time for Grand Lux. I must say,  I have never been disappointed until this last Sunday.  We arrived after a movie. Early evening. It wasn't as busy as it's been in the past couple times we've been. The ground floor host just sent us up. I really love that main dining room facing Michigan ave. I was hopeful we'd get a window table but figured probably wouldn't happen. (Which is fine) She wanted to seat us in a tiny half booth and I had looked around as saw MANY other 4 tops type booths available.  We both kinda indicated that the small 2 top would not be really big enough for my hubby. He's not that big but he likes to have arm room at least. Obviously,  if it had been busy we would have just taken that original table. But it wasn't.  So as soon as we politely asked her if we could have a bigger table with some wiggle room. She immediately darted back towards the hostess stand. (not indicating what we were to do? follow her? wait?) so after a second or two, we went after her to tell her we'd like to have a roomier table (in case she had not heard us) because she just fled. We caught up with her at the hostess stand again and repeated our preference to which she replied, "" I can't seat you at that table because we are closing that section"".  I started to say something and she repeated this time saying, ""The server for that section has been cut and I'm not allowed to sit you there"".  REALLY?  It's like 7pm on a Sunday evening? That dining area is 95% full. Anyone working in that room would have to walk by that booth?  Are you seriously telling me that I can't have that empty table that each and every server is going to walk past???? So rather than make a scene we just allowed her to seat us in that drafty table in front of the pos terminal.  She was not exactly nice about her delivery of this either. She seemed annoyed that I asked her twice.  Then the service.   Our server was pleasant enough, just not knowledgeable. Which kinda surprised me because I've always felt that the servers, hosts, etc here know their stuff.  She stopped by 3 times before we decided what we wanted. She never went over the menu nada. Just order. taker. When I ordered the Ahi Salad,  she said, let me check to make sure we have that and looked at her pad and then said. Yes we have it and then muttered something like because we are out of some of the seafood's"". Really?  I'm glad they had it because I would have likely ordered some type of seafood and if you hadn't bothered telling (on one out three trips to the table) I would have been not happy that they were out and she never bothered mentioning to me?  The Ahi in the salad:  So the salad itself was OK but that Ahi?  It had a really odd texture from a. either being sliced WAAAY too thin or ??  It just didn't seem like the Ahi I've had in a million other Ahi salads.  I asked her what the rice paper? was on the Ahi? She said she would go check? Which she did and then she said it was seaweed.  In any case,  that didn't bother me. I just couldn't place what was so ODD tasting texture etc about that Ahi.  It was unpleasant enough that I didn't eat it all (which normally, I would have devoured) as you can never get enough of Ahi right?  It had no seasoning, it was just I dunno. Weird.   So that's sums up our worst meal at GL.  I normally leave there feeling like I can't wait to go back. Now,  I'm not so sure?",0.9865,0.829,0.111,0.06,0.5216695011337869

I also liked that there were so many other bites, minis and tapas to choose from. Lunch specials are served till 5:00  - virtually unheard of at other places.

Be ready for big portions and make sure to leave some room for their delicious desserts! Things that my husband and I have tried. Beverages:  Their strawberry lemonade is so good especially in the summer. It is one of the very few restaurants which makes it fresh and doesn't use the fake disgusting powder lemonade. Apps:  Love their hummus and dip. It's not your traditional hummus and has a slight kick to it but is very good nonetheless. It's more than enough for two people so be sure to ask for extra pita bread to take home if you have leftovers.  Salad:  I have only gotten a chance to try their Cesare salad and it goes perfectly with their Margherita pizza. Entree:  Shrimp Jambalaya is the perfect thing to get for those who like to spice things up! It's a very well-balanced dish and is a great seafood pasta option. Pasta fresca: What a perfect dish to have during spring and fall. They use fresh vegetables that complement each other perfectly. I get it at least every other time. Garlic Shrimp pasta was decent. Nothing special. Crispy Fish and Chips normally can be very overwhelming but the ones at GLC are just right! Be sure to give them a try. Miso glazed Salmon is my husband's favorite! He ends up getting that almost every time he goes there.  Cedar planked BBQ Salmon: Salmon is something I enjoy immensely but stay away from this dish at GLC! I tried this last year and it was a total disappointment.  Dessert: All of their cheesecakes are good as they are the same as cheesecake factory's. Cupcake Collision is absolutely the most scrumptious dessert on their menu!  A perfect chocolate/vanilla combo.

I have visited several times and enjoyed the food, which is reasonably priced esp for the city.  For these factors alone I would have given 5 stars The biggest problem I encountered was on my last visit. My party and I sat at the bar while we waited for our table. Naturally, we ordered a few drinks at the bar. After 45 mins, our table was ready. I asked the bartender to transfer our drinks to the table as the hostess was standing there waiting for us to gather our things. Instead of this being a simple process, the bartender was rude about the situation and refused to transfer our drinks to our table. She gave no explanation as to what the issue was and why this wasn't a possibility.  I have never encountered this issue at other eateries and have always had my bar bill transferred to the table. This slowed down our seating by another 10-15 minutes. It was extremely inconvenient and it disrupted the rest of the dining experience. It's unfortunate the bar experience isn't better considering the drinks were more than half the check. Secondly, while we sat at the bar, two bartenders were busy making themselves drinks. We watched them poor/shake/and blend some sort of mudslide chocolate syrup drink for one another. Then, they took spent turns taking sips. They were offering tastes to the waitresses as they came up to the bar to place/retrieve drinks.

Food was very good not outstanding but certainly better than average for this price point. Our second visit just a few days ago was a contrast, we visited at night approximately 7 PM lighting was very dim and extremely Loud music was blaring during the entire meal. Overall the second experience gave the impression of a club/ restaurant with overly loud music and dim lighting making it impossible to talk and very difficult to see your food.

If it's too crowded, head outside if it's nice, take in some fresh air. After going up the stairs to the main dining area, you're obviously taken to either your booth or table.

Justin, our server came over to take our order but wasn't familiar with the menu, as we were asking questions all he responded with was, I don't know, I'm new. Justin here's a tip, when you start a job get familiar with the company and and their product, also, if you don't know the answer, inquire, find out the answer, not just for the customer but for yourself.  After placing our order for three appetizers, we waited, and waited and waited some more...watching everyone around us coming and going. My friend and I started playing a game, when a new customer came in we timed how fast they received their bread basket, placed and received their orders.  When our waiter finally resurfaced.  I asked him when our order would be out, very rudely he stated in a few minutes. I responded with in five minutes it will be one hour of waiting. He rolled his eyes and walked away.  He then brought us a bread basket, Justin you should have done that 55 minutes ago! One hour and five minutes later we finally received our appetizers, cold. He placed the appetizers in the middle of the table and sat the bread in front of me.  It was so apparent how upset we were, the manager walked over to talk to us. He was very nice, I wish I had gotten his name. When I explained how long it took for us to receive our food he was shocked. He comped our food and immediately send Jay another server over.

2013-08-06,4.0,"Our group of 9 girls dropped by this location late at night for a 9pm dinner after a day at the magnificent mile. although it wasn't our first choice of restaurant, this i was the only place at a reasonable price that's still open and offers a good variety of food.  None of us has ever been to this place but we didn't have much other choice around the area. At first I thought this was a upscale dining place, but it was a pleasant surprise to find the food were actually reasonably priced.  now moving on to the actual experience: 1. Menu/atmosphere: the menu was extensive and decently priced. I don't recall all of it but i can see there was something for everyone. It was a late night dinner so i couldn't try any thing decadent or have dessert but i saw that desserts were made fresh to order. The atmosphere was noisy but it's understandable since the restaurant was 100% filled with families who have children. Otherwise it was great, the restroom was super clean given the amount of people, i can see the kitchen was clean too.  2. Food: the portion is very large , my friends got the small salad and they were more than enough for dinner.  I believe most of them enjoyed their food and for what I recall the salad and perogies were good. I got the pasta dish with some chicken and sausage, the food was just too salty, i actually couldn't remember how it's suppose to taste like because my tongue was hurting from the salt. I also got some tortilla creamy tomato soup that was also too salty. If i ever visit again, i'll order something light.  3.  Service: 5/5 it was the friendliest service i've ever received at a chain restaurant. the server was pleasant to our large group and i received complimentary soup for waiting for the pasta for maybe 5 min longer. our wait for a table was also much shorter than estimated which was great when you are starving at 9pm.  Overall a good experience and I will visit again next time I visit the US. The bottomline is this restaurant is a go to place if you have a large group who aren't too picky/hardcore foodies and they just want to have a good time. This place is great for tourists who want to avoid tourist traps and get food at a very reasonably price.

Over the years, I've been able to try many different pastas, pizzas, appetizers, and even some Asian-inspired dishes from Grand Lux. They're all pretty good, especially the potato spring rolls, desserts, and the Asian nachos. The desserts are also super rich. My favorite dessert item is the beignets, which by themselves are soft and sweet but also come with amazing dipping sauces (including a Jack Daniels' sauce - yum!). This particular location is one of the largest I've seen, with a great location on Michigan Ave and a beautiful view of the Magnificent Mile below.

So, 6/29/13 was a special day for me and I wanted to host a dinner at Grand Lux for 40 people. So therefore, I called 2 weeks in advance to make reservations. First, I had to go through 5 employees transferring calls finally got in touch with the manager ""sach"" I told him about the occasion and booked my reservation. Within the two weeks I called 2 times to confirm my reservation just to make sure. All the time they said its good. So, the time comes... and my party gets there on time. The host said it will take 45 mins... So i went and spoke with the same manager ""SACH"" to tell him about the issue. He said the reservation you made is called ""SOFT RESERVATION"" ... I was like what is a soft reservation... he said that your name would be on top of the waiting list. I am like there is no one else on the waiting but us...HAD I KNOWN IT is A SOFT RESERVATION I would NOT have ever went here.  Later, I spoke with another manager ""JEFF"" told him about the issue and see if he can make this process faster because we had been waiting there for an hour. In addition,  we had to be somewhere later that night and I had told that to SACH when I had made the reservation. His way of accommodating my guest was by saying CAN I SIT 18 people???

2013-07-01,4.0,"Overlooking the Magnificent Mile, Grand Lux Cafe seemed like a touristy, slightly overpriced spot that was always filled with people. But after hearing good things about the food there and realizing that the prices were very reasonable, my brother and I decided to check it out. We first went there for Saturday brunch and loved it! We had no wait, were promptly seated in the rotunda with the great view and beautiful curtains, had great service, and the food was so good! We first started with the Macaroni & Cheese Skillet and BBQ Pork Sliders, both of which were delicious (okay, I guess technically we got bread first, which was standard and good)! The pork sliders especially were full of flavor, had the perfect amount of sauce, and were just so amazing. We wanted more. We then decided to try the Chicken and Waffles, more for the novelty of it than anything else. My brother really enjoyed them, but since I was never a fried chicken person to begin with, though they were okay. The waffles, however, were pretty good and the syrup was delicious. Already stuffed from all of the food and unable to finish the waffles, we then put our game faces back on and tried the New Orleans Beignets, which a friend had strongly recommended. They were so oily and sugary and sank in deep into the pits of our stomachs, but were pretty good. They come with three dipping sauces and the chocolate one is by far the best. At the end of day 1, I was ready to give Grand Lux Cafe a coveted 5-star rating. After such a good meal on Saturday, my brother and I were hoping for a repeat experience the next morning (it was also around the corner from our hotel so not wanting to go too far might have also had something to do with it). It was less crowded this time, but we were seated in a darker room next to the places with the registers and water. Not ideal seating at all. We wanted to move but for some reason there was a wait for a better seat? Made no sense. We reordered the mac & cheese, which was still solid and delicious and the sliders, which were less awesome this time around. They were still good, but the bun was over toasted and the pork a bit dry and in need of more sauce. We also got the Spanish Chorizo and Cheese Croquettes and Eggplant Parmesan Fritters, both of which weren't mind-blowing, but were decent. Finally, we got the Blueberry Buckle, which I had been eyeing from the day before. It was delicious! I loved the warm blueberries and the ice cream with the lemon rind was so good and refreshing.

I had the cajun chicken lunch portion which was just delicious.  Came with rice and cajun style chicken and veges.   I do like this place, just one thing that may keep me from coming back is the service.  Yea, we have more than six people which grants added gratuity but really does it mean a lazy server who doesn't bother to check up on you?  I was so close to leaving what I believed to be am appropriate amount for tip.   The thing that really got to me was when I asked for the check, he was circling to another table and I waved him down signaling for it.  then my brother in law asked him a couple minutes later not knowing I just had, and this guy's attitude responding ""I'm getting it"" and shaking his head as he walks away.  WTF!? Spent $200 and left with a bitterness since it was my treat.  No one was happy.  My wife later told me that as we all got up to leave the server sort of just ignored us while making eye contact with her more than once without even waving goodbye. The food would get four stars but the one star service kills it.  Please train your employees with more customer service, retention skills, and mostly respect.  Coming out here from the NW burbs is not an everyday thing, just to eat.  My wife really likes this place but it got knocked down, possibly out of our routine stops for city eating.

Think abridged version. Because the size of the dishes are always overwhelming I opted to make the apps my meal. I was with a small group of friends and the app we shared was still humungous. My actual app meal was the chorizo croquettes and mini cheddar sliders. Probably should have went with the mini tacos since they would have only given 3 as opposed to the 4 sliders on my plate. And did I mention there were like 5-7 croquettes? Even their small plate options can still be enough to stuff you. I did like that even though I had mini sliders and asked for it medium rare, it actually came out the way I wanted without being overly dry or  under done.

Cons:  long waits (at least ppl get to wait downstairs & not near the dining room), slippery floors (especially wearing heels), sad b-day free dessert (whipped cream...wtf?) - my friends had the waiter bring it over.  For the price of the food, they shoul've provided something better, or just said ""we don't give free desserts on b-days"".  That would've been better.",0.9921,0.667,0.305,0.028,0.5535087719298246

The place is huge, so I've never had to wait too long for a table (but I try to avoid places like this at peak dinner hours). If I had to guess, I'd say they have the same owners as the cheesecake factory, they are both very similar in food and decor.  Grand lux has a huge menu, so there is literally something for everyone. I'm a big fan of small plates, which grand lux has on their menu. The honey and goat cheese salad, hummus, and ahi tuna small plates are all excellent. I'm not a huge dessert person, but the beignets are amazeballs. Literally, they are amazing doughnut-like balls with three types of sauce to dip them in.

It's baked to order, so order ~20 minutes before you actually want it. The hot chocolate is super filling and pretty good. Maybe on par with Ghiradelli's hot chocolate. Finally, their fresh baked cookies. I teased my friend for ordering a dozen cookies with a glass of milk, but they were actually pretty delicious.

My bf lives a block away from the place and has been there many times and says he has never tried anything that wasn't absolutely mouthwatering. The dessert menu is comparatively small, but certainly lives up to the rest of the menu option. My recommendations are for the bread pudding or the beignets.

The burger itself was well-seasoned and not overly drippy (properly rested). The bun (brioche) was, as a result, not soggy and not too thick that it was hard to eat.

2012-11-19,1.0,"Disappointing ... I was here two years ago and enjoyed a decent meal with decent service in a decent environment. It sure has changed. I was there Sat Nov 10 and couldn't believe the wait - 2 hours - and the rudeness and lack of professonalism of the downstairs ""greeters"" staff at the desk. The two workers were short with everyone, and acting very high and mighty and uppity. Finally, into the upstairs and taken to our table. Closet is more like it. We were seated at a barely-bistro-sized table that could not, later on, accommodate all of our food plates. A glass got knocked over by the waiter. The table was literally three inches away from the neighboring table, occupied by two girls who clearly did not understand the concept of ""indoor voices"" and not being at an outdoor hip hop event. Enough said on that .. you get the picture. There was a huge ""thug"" element here and it made for an unpleasant evening. Some people do not know how to behave appropriately in a public space such as this very huge restaurant, and it ruins the experience for others. Food .... on a scale of 1 to 100, I'd give it about a 65. The pineapple upside down cake, which allegedly has to be ordered at the beginning of the visit, as it allegedly takes 35-40 minutes to bake, was horrific. I have had better store-bought, mass-produced pineapple upside down cake (as from Jewel-Osco) than this plate of slop I was served. The lettuce wedge salad came covered in cheese - not listed as an ingredient on the menu - and the waiter tried to play it off as boiled eggs. No, it was cheese, because when I summoned a manager over, he confirmed it. The replacement salad was off timetable with the rest of my dining companion's meals, and I was just starting my entree when they were finishing theirs. I think this place has too many tables and booths for the space available. Cut back a bit, and give diners some more elbow room. Those tables-for-two have got to go, or at least not be placed so close to the next table.

After we sat down we didnt have to wait long for our food.The Staff handling reservations messed up our dinner reservation. we had 8 people but after waiting over an hour we got upstairs and our table was for 6 people so we had to split up. We werent too upset over that. The service was a bit sub par. I understand that our waitress may have been busy but her attitude seemed careless and she didnt ask how our food was or anything. Also I did not like that the tables were very long and only reachable on one side. So we had to sit there passing each other's drinks and plates around so that the waitress could get to it. Overall I thought the food was perfect but the front end needs a bit of work.

He played a ""Guess My Name"" game with us, he took pics of us + he asked us interesting questions, all with a SMILE! I was super happy + it made me a little sad that I was leaving Chicago + wouldn't be able to have Charles as my server in the future. Hands down, if you want a good time + a good server, ASK FOR CHARLES! FOOD: Hands down, my favorite thing about Grand Lux Cafe is the FOOD!!!

2012-09-03,5.0,"Interesting...somehow I have completely forgotten to write a review for this place, which has become a go-to location of ours for years.  Normally I try to avoid the Mag Mile and all its chain restaurants like the plague, but during off-times we end up here quite a lot.  Every trip has resulted in perfectly cooked food, great service, and (if planned right) short to no wait times.  I'm also very stingy with 5 star reviews, but considering the competition in that area of the city and the expected costs, this just hits the mark.  For a kitchen that can roll people in and out in mass quantities I find the food is always spot-on. The Double Stuffed Potato Spring Rolls are a de facto standard and is partially the reason we go here in the first place.  Otherwise I usually pick something different for an entree and although the selections never seem that great on the menu the results that arrives at our table always look and taste wonderful. I'm not sure if they need photos or just better descriptions of the food but I continually arrive here less than enthusiastic, but always leave wondering why we don't go there even more often. The only down-side is the ridiculous wait that queues up during normal eating hours and especially on weekend and holidays.  During peak hours I'd recommend venturing off of Michigan Ave and use your handy-dandy Yelp app to find some other gems in the city, but if it is off-hours and the downstairs lobby is not packed to the point that the revolving door is wedged full of tourists then don't skip this one.",0.981,0.815,0.13,0.055,0.5555408583186361

On another note: I was celebrating my bday in Chicago this weekend so my husband snuck and told them. Heads up: if you let the staff know it's someone's bday in your group they will bring a VERY thin toffee tasting thingy (which was good) that flakes and cracks up in your hand. It's a mess! Then there's two small decorative icing swirly things on the plate with a candle in one. I was so confused on what to do with it that we had to ask the waiter ""what do you do with this?""

We went for an early dinner (late lunch?) at around 4PM on a Friday.  There were probably a lot of people there, but the size of the place and the number of tables dwarfed the number of people.  So, we, a party of six,  were seated immediately.  The menu is very large and diverse.  We all had different items off of the menu from hamburgers to salads.  I had a cuban sandwich which had a nice twist to it.  The bread was outstanding, the pulled pork fresh and tasty.

This was the reason why I decided to go here for my bday dinner with some of my close girlfriends.  The food and service is about 3 stars. I was a little disappointed in the shake beef dish. The waitress told me that there were jalapenos in the dish and it was very spicy. When the dish came out, I didn't see any jalapenos or taste any spice in the dish. The other dishes that we ordered included the jambalaya, salmon, seared ahi tuna salad, scallops. I think my gf's thought the same thing, it was just ok. The reason why I downgraded it to a 2 star is because of the horrible attitude and service we received from the hostess, Amanda. I can understand that it gets busy at times and you have a lot of people coming up to the hostess table, but to put your hand out in a customer's face and sigh extremely loud then say ""you're going to have to wait for your turn"" in a very rude manner is completely unacceptable. This happened not once, but twice when we went up to check on the status of our table since our buzzer didn't buzz and it was right around the time when they estimated that our table would be ready. I was VERY turned off by this. I used to work as a waitress and know that customers can be demanding at times, but by no means would I act so unprofessional and give the customers an attitude.

2012-07-30,3.0,"First time at Grand Lux Cafe was during a recent trip to Chicago. My friend and I went on a Friday early evening and did not wait that long for a table.  Grand Lux is a lot like Cheesecake Factory; they're practically the same restaurant.  We ordered edamame as a starter. I like how they marinated in soy sauce and other spices to add to the flavor. I was disappointed in my sandwich. I ordered a chipotle grilled chicken sandwich, and it came with ingredients not listed on the menu, such as corn and avocado, which I normally do not eat. From my understanding, the ""chipotle"" part referred to the type of mayo they would use on the sandwich. Our waiter (John K) did offer to rectify the situation, however, and was extremely nice, easygoing and attentive (would give 5 stars for service). If you go here, you must try the beignets! Apparently these are a signature item of Grand Lux, and they recommend ordering early in your meal, as they take a half an hour to prepare. The beignets came HOT, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  One thing that was off-putting for me was when we were ready to be seated, the waitstaff told us to go upstairs around some corner, down the hall, etc etc. We, along with some other patrons, we're a bit confused, as when we got upstairs, there was no one there to greet us. They should move the host/hostess upstairs to better guide you.  I'd go here again and perhaps would give it more stars the second time around.",0.9743,0.854,0.119,0.027,0.5165674603174603
2012-07-27,2.0,"After reading the reviews, I was looking forward to a nice dinner with my husband and 3 of our friends. I ended up having an ok dinner, but I will probably not return. Our service was terrible- I had to flag down the waitress 3 times throughout our time there to refill drinks. She never stopped by to see if we needed anything or wanted another drink (most of our party had ordered mixed drinks - at $11 each and absolutely not worth the money). It took her 45 minutes to take our dinner order - and I had to flag her down for that too. The other reviews had said that this was similar to a more upscale Cheesecake Factory. I disagree. Overall, the food was just ok. I had a burger- it was a regular burger. My husband had the BBQ salmon. The salmon was undercooked, and it came with mashed potatoes that had been tubed/piped onto the sides of the salmon and it looked like mashed potato cake frosting. The other 3 in our party ordered various sandwiches, all of which looked like regular deli sandwiches. Nothing special. The saving grace of the night was our deserts. I spilt the pineapple upside down cake with my husband, and it was one of the best pineapple upside down cakes I've ever had. Our friends had the carrot cake and cheesecake, and they said those were great also.  There were a few pros for the place, which, aside from the desserts, is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1.  We went on a Monday at 6pm and didn't have to wait for a table- impressive, considering its location on the Mag Mile. The atmosphere was nice, comfortable and casual, which is always a bonus. And their food prices for entrees were standard for the area. But overall, this was a less than average dinner experience for me. I'd rather wait the 45 minutes for a table at the Cheesecake Factory and receive good food and service than wait 45 minutes to get a refill on ice water at the Grand Lux.",0.9965,0.783,0.192,0.026,0.4473988973988974

The beignets were yummy as others have said, thats actually why I decided to try them. The sauces were a nice option but not necessary. Those who tried the apple pie said it was delicious but again too much to finish between 2 people. We only finished about half the beignets as well (came with 6 or 7 I believe).  I also had the honey vanilla latte (nonfat) which was nice but a little too sweet for me, I couldn't even finish it but I'm also not used to having that much sweets.

It was bad!! The manager was very apologetic and because we had plans after dinner in the city to catch a show, and my friend was obviously extremely upset, the manager actually went downstairs to Michigan Ave with her right then and there after she washed up and bought her a new dress and bag to wear in place of what she had on.  I dunno if there is a company credit card or something but he went above and beyond that night. Customer service at it's absolute best. Not to mention the restaurant paid for her dry cleaning bill and also sent her a gift certificate to a salon.  In all honestly though, I have not had one thing at this place that I have never liked. Their avocado chipotle cheeseburger is sooooo yummy!! The chicken madeira is Heaven.

All that aside, you have a plethora of options to choose from, because although it is American cuisine, to Americans that means anything so it can be hard to choose your meal.  I personally get tempted by the elaborate dessert case you pass before being seated, and some desserts require a full 30 minuets to prepare, so be prepared to know if you want to please your sweet tooth.  The portions are pretty gargantuan, but the aim is to impress.   If you are on a diet, BEWARE!  This place is full of things that make you want to cheat, but if you do so, cheat wisely.  Skip the sugary drink and get a dessert.  Also, for the college student splurging, the meals are usually big enough to eat half and take the other half home for a second meal so you feel like you're budgeting after all.

Molten Lava cake was very good, but the ice cream that came with it did not taste like anything at all, if that makes sense. Ordered the linguini cabonara, which I thought tasted good.

The menu is just as overwhelming but was slightly more adventurous than your run of the mill midwestern cheesecake factory offering. We ordered a bunch of stuff from their appetizers/small plates list and skipped on ordering any massive entrees. I've been on a Korean BBQ Taco trip for a while now and will order it if its on the menu anywhere and I will have to say the ones at the Grand lux were Fantastic! They were just the right size, they come in servings of 3. The bulgogi was beautifully marinated and it comes with a side of kimchi sauce which tasted amazing!  I'd definitely recommend trying them. My friend ordered some beignets, which we needed to be schooled on what exactly they were before we ordered them! Turns out they're small, doughnut like pastries and they were absolutely delicious! Also a definite recommend. All in all, we were pleasantly surprised by the choice of offerings at this place.

Their ranch dressing will put you in orgasmic state because they make it from scratch in-house, but its a garlic ranch.. so bring breath mints. :) Drink of choice? Every single one on the menu. I know.. thats terrible and I feel like a fat-a$$ saying that.. but the Strawberry Martini is made with real fresh grinded strawberries, and the Belini is amazing.... its all good. Which desert? Definitely the Creme Brulee or the New Orleans Bagnets. However.... if you are feeling really daring.. get the Chocolate Molten Cake.. because it just has the best effect on your mood 5 minutes after eating it :) The New Orleans Bagnets are just a little too much food for 2 ppl (unless you are pretty hungry after your meal, which is rare for most people) because its an entire basket of fried dough. haha, good comfort food though.",0.9971,0.664,0.303,0.033,0.6206336766681595

2012-03-26,3.0,"Almost every review here mentions that the Grand Lux Cafe is a subsidiary of the Cheesecake Factory, and how it's almost exactly the same. You don't realize how seriously you should take that to heart until you come. 7 pm on a Monday, 10-15 minute wait for three people. We had time to check out the building, which looks exactly like a Cheesecake Factory. They have this weird system where they call you upstairs with a pager, then make you wait in a crowded hallway until your name is called, which may not be that soon after, necessarily. We had a really nice table overlooking Michigan Ave., which was nice even being locals.  The fresh bread was good, hot sourdough and a wheaty bread, and they brought us an extra basket without us even asking. I ordered the Mushroom Veggie Burger (not to be confused with their OTHER veggie burger-- that's right, they have two!), and it was really, really tasty. I was also really, really, hungry, but I think it would have been good even if I wasn't!  The burger part you could tell was fresh-made, falling apart in the best kind of ways. And it came with a garlicky mayo that absolutely completed the savory flavors. I love that you can get a salad instead of fries, and the salad was fine... some mixed greens and cherry tomatoes with a vinaigrette dressing. My parents, both meativores, thought their dishes were only so-so. My mom got the scampi-chicken parmesan combo, and really enjoyed the shrimp scampi, but left half of the chicken parm. My dad got the Indo-chine something-or-other, and thought it was overpowered by ginger and lacking in flavor overall.

A restaurant can have average food and fantastic service and I will surely go back. A restaurant can have excellent food and bad service and I most likely won't go back. Grand Luxe has average food and horrible service, you couldn't pay me to eat there again. It took our server about 10 minutes to greet us, using the whole ""have you dined with us before?"" spiel. I felt like saying ""spare me the lesson about your food, I've been sitting her for 10 minutes, I know what I want."" We ordered 2 coffees, a kids French Toast, 2 items off the brunch menu and beignets. It took 5 minutes to get our coffee and the mugs were dirty. I was getting really anxious around the 20 minute mark about where our food was. When it came I realized what the hold up was. It had sitting under a heat lamp for the last 10 minutes. Much to my dismay my plate was half covered by an omelette (topped with willed garnish) the other half completely empty except for grease that had seeped out during it's stay under the heat lamps. The plate itself was boiling lava hot. My boyfriends breakfast, which was under the same heading as mine, included toast and hashbrowns, mine did not. Since when does an omelette not come with anything on the side?! And why would the server not tell me this? The menu doesn't indicate everything is a la carte. Our meals are dropped off by a food runner who promptly walks away leaving us with empty coffee cups, no syrup, no ketchup and no begniets, etc. We don't see our server for another 5 minutes or so. I could go on and on because this process kept repeating itself.

In addition, my other friend had an allergic reaction to it because she has a nut allergy. My other friend  had the Asian chicken salad, and chicken alfredo pasta.  Why 4 stars? My friend had an allergic reaction to the chicken pot pie because of her peanut allergy. We had asked if there was supposed to be nuts in there, but the waiter reassured us that no nuts were in the pot pie. And so we asked for a manager . She came by and told us that the pot pie was cooked in an oven and prepared on a table that was not near the handling of nuts. Of course, that doesn't matter since my friend, in fact, had an allergic reaction.

My entree was the pasta with chicken mushrooms and sundried tomatoes.  It was a huge serving of food, as expected.  I wasn't too fond of the form of pasta they used for it.  I believe it was gemelli; would have preferred a fetucchini because this shape just seemed to dense, somehow.  The dish itself could have been more flavorful and used more of the sun dried  tomatoes.

Our waitress was friendly, but we kept having to call her over to our table to receive service. They are either stretched too thin or are very slow. The food was just above average. We must have had a late batch of beignets, because they weren't that tasty unless you dipped it in one of the three sauces they provided. I ordered a pot roast and chicken royale duo. The pot roast was one piece of very dry meat (isn't pot roast suppose to be tender?) atop small amount of vegetables. A huge mash potato serving in the middle, which I admit was tasty. And a flattened, breaded, and fried chicken breast that I will admit was very good. My mother enjoyed an order of ribs and my sister enjoyed a salad. My nephew seemed to have enjoyed chicken tenders and fries.  The prices are a on the high side. Our tab was just over $100. Not sure I would go back here again voluntarily.",0.9855,0.876,0.124,0.0,0.5541578345026619

(I really wanted to try one but asking that much from a college student  for a dessert is a little much, especially with that Chicago tax rate). Back to the positive, the spicy chicken flat bread that i ordered was delicious, and honestly could have passed at 2 whole sandwiches (that's how big the portion was).  I also had the buffalo bites as an appetizer and they were very good as well, kind of like mini crab cakes except with buffalo chicken instead of crab.  I would definitely recommend the Grand Lux Cafe, just be cautious about when you go because you are bound to have a long wait if you go at prime dinner hours.",0.9938,0.757,0.231,0.013,0.6165673981191222

There was 8 of us but they would not let my friend make a reservation. They told her she could only make a reservation for a maximum of 4 people. REALLY? I would think that they would allow reservations for a larger group with the minimum being 4 people.  They first told us we had to wait for an hour, ok I could do that. An hour passed and we had to wait for another 30 minutes. And they wouldn't seat us unless our whole group was there. I ordered the jambalya which I've had before and was quite delicious, so I ordered it again with brown rice. Once my food arrived I begin to eat the rice and it was crunchy dry and hard. I would think that a fabulous place such as the Grand Lux would know how to cook something as simple as brown rice. I was highly disappointed. The rice was on the same plate as the Jambalya. You would think they would bring me a fresh new plate but instead the waitress just brought me some more rice on another plate.

Be sure to get reservations or prepare for a long wait. The food genre is your typical american food pasta, burgers, steaks, and fish without anything too special.

My aunt and cousin ordered the Chicken Ceaser Salad and a Mexican Chicken Salad they both didn't like. My uncle ordered the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with a side salad with vinegrette dressing.

I ordered a Mai Tai which was great (not Bob Chinns great), a Miller Lite bottle, and the Manhattan salad with Turkey and Cheese added.

All things considering, both places serve decent fare for a decent affordable price. Considering the location, Grand Lux is extremely affordable. However, I would classify Grand Lux as a tourist trap. What? how can it be a tourist trap if the food is decent and the prices are right? BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN FOOLED SON! This place is basically a Cheesecake Factory under a different name. So ask yourself- why are you coming into the heart of Chicago, a city renown for its amazing food, and eating at the Cheesecake Factory?? That's the trap, and I think it's pretty sneaky to deprive tourists of great food more representative of Chicago. Go home and eat at your local Cheesecake Factory!

My fiance had the BBQ chicken, which came with jalapeno cheese cornbread, fries and coleslaw. I loved the coleslaw but the cornbread had too much jalapeno.

I knew it probably wouldn't hold a candle to the real deal that you'd get at a place like Bubba's Cooks Country in Dallas, but I at least expected it to challenge the Popeye's Chicken across the street off Michigan Avenue. No dice--this was just sad. The breading and skin was crispy, but was just ""meh"" in flavor. The meat of the chicken was rather flavorless and seemed undercooked in places and overcooked in others. Damn! How do you screw that up in both ways! It should be a plus that they gave me five pieces. Yes, FIVE, but damn, son--quality over quantity rules in my book. Can I trade in five bland pieces for three great pieces??  It came with mashed potatoes, and what sort of Southerner serves that up without gravy? None, that's who.  Our waiter was a trip, but when I asked if they had gravy back there, he took my tentativeness as shyness and joked with my friends about it. Naw, dude, I'm asking if you have for-real gravy, not if you have au jus or something you're going to try to pass off as gravy. I dunno WTH he brought out, but that mess was not gravy. Don't be trying to fool me with that concoction.  I'd have given it three stars for just being so-so, but coming back from the ladies' room, I nearly wiped out.

Our server was extremely accomodating and made us feel like we were his only table.  He also did a great job of topping off our coffee mugs which was much needed after a night out!

2011-08-18,2.0,"I've been to the one in LA and it's obviously similar except that it's not so friggin' loud and just utter chaos as this one is.  There are always hordes of people waiting, spilling over into the dining area, some of them are so loud that you can barely hear the person you're talking to at your table. Anyway... so overall, I'm just disappointed in a couple ways but they did the best they could I guess, which saved a one star review.  We went there on a Saturday night... I was in town to see my family and my parents refuse to go to anything but chain restaurants so this isn't bad after a day downtown.   Our wait wasn't terrible for a Saturday night, about 25 minutes.  There's a Marshall's next door if you wanna kill some time while waiting (as a die hard ""every team from Chicago fan (except for the Cubs!!)"" I stocked up on my Bears, Sox, and Bulls gear to take back to LA with me... so I didn't mind the wait at all. Our waiter was overworked for sure, but he did his best, but he was MIA most of the night.  I don't blame him, like I said, he was trying but there just wasn't enough staff to handle the Viking-fleet of people eating there that night.   My parents' food was great.  They got typical ""American"" food, my old man got... man, what was it... can't remember, but it was good.  My mom got, um, fried chicken.  Wow, way to step out of your comfort zone.  I got my daughter a grilled cheese.  Fortunately, she couldn't finish it -- most amazing grilled cheese I've ever had.  No, seriously.  It's like two one inch slices of bread, perfectly crispy... or maybe I thought it was the best ever because I never really got a meal. I ordered a grilled chicken dish, super simple, right?  When it came out, it was charred... I mean, black.  The one side didn't look too terrible but the cook tried to hide it by turning over the pitch black side.  Super dry, no flavor.  I tried to eat but for the first time in my life, I had to send it back.  The waiter was horrified when he saw it, clearly pissed at the kitchen staff.   While I was waiting, the manager came over, apologized -- which was very cool, I thought.  He offered some soup in the meantime, but I didn't want anything extra for free, not how I roll. Problem #1.  They clearly didn't put my re-order in the front of the line, it was way in the back.  Everyone was done with their dinner and we just sat there waiting and waiting.  After a while, I flagged down the waiter and asked him to cancel it.  The manager again came over and said it was almost done and he wouldn't charge us but he didn't to throw it away. Problem #2.  We waited for a while still... and it finally came out, it was overcooked again!!  It wasn't charred like the first one but definitely overcooked.  Obviously the kitchen staff was just blasting through dishes without caring.  They need to slow the hell down and do each one right instead of making more work for themselves. Problem #3.  Trying to pay was a nightmare.  We just wanted to get out of there, my daughter was falling asleep on my shoulder since it was taking so long.  But our waiter was MIA.  Then I finally flagged him down, he brought over the bill and took off.  Then we couldn't find him again!!  I finally got someone else to run my credit card. I've always loved the Grand Lux but I had to email the company about it and the manager called me, we had a great chat about the experience.  They even sent me a $20 gift certificate, which they definitely didn't have to do, but I totally appreciated it.   If you're gonna go here, try it on a weekday.  Grand Lux has good food, but it's a madhouse at night, especially on the weekends.  I had to get a two star review for that experience but this place is good depending on when you go.",0.9983,0.727,0.184,0.088,0.5545769058797227

We were seated in 5 minutes and the first thing I noticed were the HUGE portions and the fact that this was a Cheesecake Factory knock off.  Nothing wrong with Cheesecake factory, or this type of restaurant but it was eerily wanting to be just like it (unless they are owned by the same company and that is why).   We asked our waiter about some of the appetizer options for a recommendation.  They were all mostly deep fried, so i specifically asked if the calamari is lightly breaded or regularly (where it's mostly a lot).  I have been told it is very lightly breaded and mostly cannot even taste the breading.  OK so here you are thinking, I should have known better at such a place.  I have had calamari that really just has a dusting of flour... anywho.  It is drenched in breading.  Had to take most of it off, after that it was fine. For dinner I ordered the salmon trio and asked for no mashed potatoes or rice, just veggies.  My friend had a burger.  My dish was really just ok as I felt the salmon was overdone and dry inside, and therefore was drenched in the sauces.  The burger my friend had was huge but prepared well.  They forgot to bring my veggies however, and when I asked for them the waiter seemed preoccupied and then brought me some luke warm boiled broccoli.  No seasoning, nothing. For desert we ordered beignets, and those came with 3 sauces, chocolate, strawberry, and caramel.  They were very good, however beware you must order well in advance as they are made fresh.  And there were 8 HUGE beignets.  Whether they were authentic I cannot attest to, as I have never been to New Orleans, but they tasted really good to me.

2011-07-07,4.0,"I adore this restaurant and hadn't been in a couple of years. Was shopping in the area so decided to go in for dinner last night. I forgot how nice the decor is, everything is huge and extravagant looking, very lovely, but lights could be un-dimmed a bit, it's nice to be able to see your date, and your food! Also the floor in the dining area is super slippery... so watch your step! Our waitress was great, very friendly and sweet. She did stalk our table a bit, walking by and smiling at us constantly and checking in to make sure everything was alright. I do prefer that to a server who disappears for 20 minutes at a time, but it was a bit over the top. She was very accomodating though which was nice.  I ordered a glass of reisling which was delicious, and my date and I split 2 appetizers - the crispy duck triangles and the ahi cevice, both were really good. My date decided the duck triangles were his new fave appetizer in Chicago - they were really tasty!  For a main entree I ordered the Manhatten salad, with jumbo shrimp and chicken. I was a bit disappointed with it. The salad said it had potatoes, beans, beets and lots of veggies. I'll take their word for it since I could barely see any of this - they were chopped up into teeny tiny pieces! I prefer chunks that I can actually taste rather than food I have work at keeping on my fork. Would not order that again. My date got the miso salmon which was fantastic.  The portions are huge and the menu is really extensive. We didn't get dessert this time, but I've had the carrot cake and it is basically heaven.

The best way to describe it is a slightly better (and almost imperceptibly more expensive) version of The Cheesecake Factory. Hey... that's also on Mag Mile! Go figure.

The waiter was extremely friendly, and since we told him we had never been when he asked us, he explained a bit about the menu (including that the portions are large). Indeed, my salad was HUGE! I ate just about half of it while we were there, and took the rest to go. I probably could have finished it, but I wasn't starving and we only had a total of an hour from the time we left class til the time we had to be back.  I had the Manhattan Salad - an excellent choice. It's a chopped salad with fresh beets (which I had never had before, but I like a lot), asparagus, huge cheese cubes, peas, red onions, lentils, white beans, and their insanely good vinaigrette. It also came with this crazy toasted thin bread slices, which were really good too (see photo). I had half of the leftovers with some pasta I made tonight at dinner, and I still have more than enough to take for lunch tomorrow. One order, 3 meals out of it. Win.  Unfortunately since we were taking a prospective student out for lunch, we couldn't try any of their specialty drinks. But next time I absolutely will. Other thoughts: the place is pretty big, and the decor is super luxurious. All the staff we interacted with were extremely friendly.

2011-04-09,3.0,"Ah. I feel like myself out of all people needs to be reviewing this place. A friend girl told me about this place forever ago (like...5 years ago?) and I went there with one of my friends. I remember loving it upon first riding that escalator up to the dining heavens. The decor rocks, they have a few different areas upstairs. My favourite one is the circle room with the panoramic window view and the sweet chandelier. Or I like being in the room where you can overlook Michigan Ave. This is a good place to come to eat if you're one of those people that like to watch the festival of lights. If you get here early enough (THEY DONT TAKE RESERVATIONS) you can snag a sweet spot upstairs for the parade. So what I didn't know about this place until after my 15th visit or so was that it was practically a Cheesecake Factory (in which I had never been before so I had no room to compare). Cheesecake Factory to me is OK. I feel the like the location I've been to is such a family kind of atmosphere and I kind of hate that. So after I saw the comparisons and menu and decor I was like ""aw mannn"" It kind of took away from the unique-ness of my Grand Lux. I want you to know this though; if there is one place that is always consistent and can please everyone, it's probably this one. The fact that this place is surrounded by amazing shops and a phenomenal buzz of energy always makes this place feel more swanky than it is. The menu definitely has something for everyone and the desserts are TO DIE FOR. If you have any hint of a brain you will pre-order your apple pie to be baked especially for you- it has never disappointed ANYONE. I have brought almost everyone I know here for a meal and no one has ever been unsatisfied. The portions are huge, but reasonably priced. They do Breakfast, Lunch, & Dinner and have some specials that run through 5pm. Again, it needs to be noted- THEY DONT TAKE RESERVATIONS.

2011-04-05,3.0,"Until last week, I absolutely LOVED Grand Luxe Cafe...  It was the go-to place for a date, for dessert after shopping with the girls, for an employee's birthday, etc.  The decor was extravagant, the menu was expansive, and the prices were reasonable.  For all these reasons is why I thought it would be the perfect place to bring my visiting supervisors from New York.  However, I've never been so wrong in my life.  Knowing that we would have a slightly larger group (8 people) I made a reservation.  When we arrived a few minutes late we were informed that our table was given away (understandably so although, we were spoken to incredibly rudely) and that we would have to wait to even find out how long the wait for another table would be (though there wasn't a single person waiting in the lobby with us).  After being told that it would be another 45 minutes until a table opened we agreed that we would wait.  After only 20 minutes were told that the table was ready and that it would be given away again if the entire party wasn't present in the next 5 minutes.  As this was still 25 minutes before the table was supposed to be ready, we had a couple of girls enjoying the fresh air and a couple of girls in the bathroom to kill time.  To make matters worse, 5 of the 8 girls ordered salads and they were so tasteless that we didn't finish them nor take them home.  I've always boasted about how wonderful Grand Luxe Cafe is but after my last experience, I'm not sure I'll be back...",0.8785,0.869,0.096,0.035,0.5505733353947639

The decor of the place is pretty similar, same feel, but just a lot more golden decor.  Walked in the place was packed, there was a wait, and went up stairs to see if there were some tables at the bar and it was packed as well.  Got seated and the waiter described the menu as a fusion of cuisine from various locations in the world.  About 3/4 of the menu was the same as the Cheesecake Factory with a little twist. I had the Miso Salmon because I liked it before and it was pretty much the same as the Cheesecake Factory, but I think I like the Cheesecake Factory more.  The salmon was a little overcooked, and the sauce was just mixed into the whole platter.  On the hand they would usually put the sauce around my rice, so it was not saturated in it. All-in-all our meal was good, but I would have much preferred to have gone to the Cheesecake Factory where the menu is larger and could have had the same food.  I guess the view is nice in Chicago and the decor was a little nicer, but I would prefer going to a hole in the wall restaurant with amazing food.  I would come back and eat here again, but overall everything was mediocre.",0.9891,0.856,0.138,0.006,0.4897321428571428

Great atmosphere, delicious food, attentive servers, and timely food. We did have to wait around 25 minutes for a table however. We thought we would avoid it because we got there around 4:30 but I get the feeling the place is crowded regardless of what time you arrive. I orded the spicy buffalo chicken sandich which was really good and not overly spicy. It was juicy and went really well with the fries and coleslaw they serve with sandwiches. I also got to sample the chicken salad sandwich. It consisted of a chicken, celery and green onion blend and didn't have the typical apple and grape compenonts of usual chicken salad mixtures, but I didn't miss it. It was really good. I also got a bite of the avacado burger. The burger was huge and the avacado and cheese gave it a really rich and creamy taste. It's great if you're an avacado person. I also really enjoyed our servers. They were really imformative and pleasant. We were there in the middle of a shift change so our second waitress came up and introduced herself to us which I liked.

Looking back, I think going with pancakes, or waffles would have been a better option. Two of us had scrambled eggs and egg breakfast sammy with hash browns and both were just OK. Everything was extra gooey, maybe butter, or oil, or lard? Just too coated in whatever it was - but the passing plates of breakfast carb loads looked delicious!

We were fine with the 30-minute wait and they didn't take too long - The molten chocolate cake was kinda okay. It should either be very sweet, or very bitter, this one was sort of in between, did not have a personality to dare either way. The ice cream also wasn't very sweet - The beignets I liked.

It's one of the best i've tried so far! In fact, I've never been able to have a proper molten chocolate cake. This one, once cut open, the chocolate oozes out like lava and the chocolate lava is not too sweet but just right. The outer crust is also baked perfectly.  We also ordered an apple pie. The crust of the apple pie was amazing. but I think due to a side-by-side comparison with the molten choc cake, this apple pie couldn't quite catch up. everyone was just delving into the choc cake while leaving the apple pie almost untouched (except the crust, it was ripped off).  nice food, good service, fantastic dessert.",0.9957,0.72,0.256,0.024,0.5703231292517007

Grand Lux is a gem.  It is easy to miss.  The restaurant sits atop many stores on Michigan Ave, but the entrance is on Ohio St.  Once you find the lucky door, go in, go up the stairs, and take a journey to heaven.  Food heaven, that is.   I've gone to Grand Lux on multiple occasions.  Once you are seated, a basket of bread is placed on your table.  The inside of the bread is as soft as a cloud, and the crust is crunchy (yummy combo).  You will likely get a wheat bread AND sour dough bread; both are fresh and warm just for you!  If you go during the lunch hours (11am-5pm) then you can get sweet specials (great food at affordable prices).  I usually get the half Margherita Pizza and half soup or salad.  Their Cream of Asparagus soup is absolutely divine!  The Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is devilishly good.  The Chicken isn't drowning in the buffalo sauce, that's refreshing.  All great options, but they are not the reason why I'm writing this review. I went to Grand Lux last night in a spontaneous gesture.  I ordered the Santa Barbara Chicken Sandwich.  If I thought the other foods were heavenly, this is definitely otherworldly.  A grilled chicken sandwich with melted cheese, a little bacon, avocado, and lettuce/tomato.  First thing that caught my eye was the amount of avocado on that bad boy!  There was half an avocado on my sandwich!  Even me, an avocado lover, thought that was a bit much...so I shared with my friend.  However, you can never have too much avocado!  Some places barely give you avocado scraps.   Their deserts are also godly.  Grand Lux has deserts that are baked once you order them.  I am a HUGE fan of their beignets and mini cupcakes.

I realize that they take 30 minutes but frankly if I am sitting and enjoying my meal, a good conversation in good company, I could carelss if I have to wait an additional 30 minutes after I finish my meal for dessert if I chose to have it. I do not need to be reminded 5 times about how long they take, I heard loud and clear the first time. The only other thing that got to me was that at the end my friend picked up the tab and I was going to pick up the tip, the waitress assumed that the change from the tab was hers and did not return it. Unless someone says keep the change, an assumption like that should not be made. Given that it was Christmas I left an additional tip despite her assumption (for a total of about a 45% tip) because I know how hard servers work and didn't have the heart to be grinch.",0.9849,0.844,0.149,0.007,0.5530701754385964

I kept praying that  I would not get food poisoning from the two bites I took.  Thankfully, it was the second to last thing I ate otherwise I would have spent the whole evening worrying about food poisoning. The mini burgers were ok.  Nothing remarkable to write home about.  The meatballs were flavorless but with some salt they were ok.   I also ordered the cookies. They were ok, I'm no pastry chef but I could make better.  I was just grateful that they weren't terrible though the only reason they were passable was because they were freshly baked.  After they cooled, I couldn't eat it them. To be fair the other people in my group liked what they ordered(with the exception of  one of the other foodie in the group).  In general it seems that the bigger meals are better than the small meals/tapas/appetizers--though to be honest I didn't try anyone else's food so I am basing this on the fact that I ordered small dishes and everyone else ordered larger ones. If this is indeed the case, however, then it is my advice that the Grand Lux only list the things that they do well and get rid of items that they do not do well--i.e. all of their appetizers/tapas/small plates.  I wanted to like this place but the only things I liked were the Island Cooler--a fruity drink that was far tastier than the raspberry lemonade that I ordered.  I was so relieved that I did not shell out for this meal otherwise I would have been pretty pissed rather than just being grumpy over a bad meal.",0.9933,0.759,0.189,0.052,0.6456410256410257

As for the food....  First off, the fresh sourdough and wheat bread was delicious.   Then we shared the Buffalo Chicken Rolls which were outstanding!    For my entree, I tried the Indochine Chicken and Shrimp.  I was certainly not impressed with this dish.  While it looked good, I found the dish to be quite bland and the shrimp were a bit rubbery.   I did have the opportunity to try my wife dish: the Shaking Beef and Caramel Chicken Combination.   It was delicious.   Overall, I did enjoy my night, but I left wishing I had ordered something else.",0.9934,0.664,0.299,0.037,0.6670289855072463

I had friends in town who wanted to walk the Mag Mile so we ate here.  I have to say that the ambiance was very nice. Although it  looked like Cheescake Factory it was less busy. It seemed more chill. Music was playing and it was very relaxing. Okay...so far I'm impressed.  Next I ordered the pineapple martini. It was delicious...wonderful...sweet...pineapply. However, it was lacking in liquor. So I was torn...it tasted really good but at the end of the day we drink alcohol to get tipsy. When you're paying 12 dollars a pop...well you want to get tipsy not just feel refreshed.  For dinner I ordered the chicken meatball sandwich. Now, for whatever reason the entire table got their food but they were running behind on mine. The server was very apologetic and the manager came over to apologize for the delay as well so I won't fault them for this. When I finally got it, it was pretty good. Not overly exciting but solid. I would probably get it again. Overall, this was a pretty good experience. I could definitely see myself coming back here again!",0.9968,0.713,0.276,0.011,0.5876666666666666
2010-11-12,4.0,"Okay...my two cents for Grand Lux...(which I went to for lunch and dinner couple times a weeks for years now...) 1. It is NOT a specialty restaurant...it's...h,,,...mmm.....a fancy Cheesecake Factory. I guess if you are in low-income bracket (like a student or part-timer), it may be fancier than most....but it really is a dressed up CF, nothing more, nothing less. 2. This being said, I would recommend their pork chops and their creme brulee.  CB takes 20 minutes or so to prepare, so let them know in advance. 3. It's great for quick eats/ ordinary meals between shopping on the Mile, but there are better and more special restaurants around.... Alright! Now that I said my negative comments...I will say that it is better than CF in many ways, the servers are super attentive and nice.  The wait might be bit long on weekend prime hours.  The valet parking is cheap and fast...and will give you even couple more hours to shop in the area and pick up your car after your meals! :D",0.9828,0.796,0.178,0.026,0.5827380952380953

2010-10-24,4.0,"MUST GO TO RESTAURANT IF YOU WANT A GREAT DESSERT...... Grand Lux Cafe is a tough place to review for a serious foodie. First of all,  as so many other people have pointed out, its just like the Cheesecake factory and has the feel of restaurant where they ""turn and burn"" the tables.  The little foyer at the main entrance is where you leave your name for the long wait you will have to endure if you go at a peak time. The food sizes are crazy and if you actually finish your main course you are an official fat b*stard/b*tch.  If you go here for a appetizer or main course, you will have a very average experience. However, if you go for dessert after eating in another restaurant you will be in for a great time.  The desserts are baked to order and can take over 20 minutes to arrive (its worth the wait). The Molten Chocolate cake is amazing (takes 30 minutes to get to your table but sooooooooo worth the wait) and is as good a dessert as i've ever had. The New Orleans Beignets are also amazing and great to share.  I rarely give a shout out to service staff however Joe K. has served me a few times and he is an extremely nice guy, with great knowledge of the menu and is always prepared to go the extra mile for his customers. If he serves you, you are guaranteed top notch service.

She loved her food. I really did not. Upon a recommendation from our server (who was alternately delightful & condescending - it was like Dr. Jekyl & Mr. Hyde worked there), I ordered the vegetarian Crispy Sesame Tofu. Pro: The actual squares of crispy sesame tofu were among the best tofu I've ever had.  Crunchy on the outside & almost paneer-like on the inside, they were delicious. Con:  It was soup.  The Spicy Szechuan Orange Sauce was neither spicy, nor orange, nor sauce (we're debating on the szechuan status).  It was like someone poured liquid MSG onto my plate, threw some white rice on top, garnished with a few stir-fry veggies, & then were like, ""Oh yeah.  The namesake tofu."" It was so unbelievably gross that I couldn't eat more than a couple of bites.  I didn't want to insult anyone, was unbelievably exhausted, & didn't want to make a scene, so I just told our server to wrap it up, thinking that once I took it home & added about a box of white rice to it to soak up the soup, it'd be better & worth the cost. It wasn't.  Sodium galore &, well, ick.  Also, I think that when they boxed it up, they didn't give me all that was left.  I ate maybe 4 bites at the restaurant - of a huge plate full (that's another thing - why the ginormous portions? we have a fat epidemic in this country!), & had about 2 spoonfuls when I tried to salvage it the next day).  Not that I'm complaining - cuz there went a $$ meal straight into the garbage anyways - but come on. Also, and while I know that it's part of the Cheesecake Factory chain NOW, I didn't then.  I looked around & commented, ""It's like someone is totally trying to rip off the CF.""  Oh.  That's because it basically IS the Cheesecake Factory.  I mean, I get the whole ""do what works"" idea, but it's essentially the same exact restaurant.  Same decor, same basic menu idea.  Blah blah blah.  Show a little originality.  McDonald's owns Chipotle now.  You don't see Chipotle all with the red & yellow decor. I will not go back.  If you're a tourist & you're here for a real Chicago experience, please, for the love of all things holy, don't expect it here.  If you're a tourist & don't care, just go to the Cheesecake Factory, if that's the kind of thing you like.  It's slightly less-expensiive anyways.  If you're like me & have a tourist co-worker suggest it, kindly suggest something else.  It is so. not. worth it. PS:  Reading another review briefly ... Someone actually proposed here?!  If my sig. other got down on one knee & proposed in a chain restaurant, I think I would firmly whisper, ""Get up.  We will talk about this later.""",0.9207,0.86,0.079,0.061,0.3312789351851852

By the end of the night, my fears of an over-priced, crappy service, terrible-food experience proved to be true. We walked into the restaurant and the lobby was crowded with tourists, then went upstairs to the host stand, which was also crowded with tourists. We were led to our table of 18 guests and were seated. The party was assigned two waiters, who split the table in two by guests. Apparently one waiter put in the order immediately while the other took his sweet time. Half the table received their food, while the other half of the table waited for 30 minutes, watching the food go uneaten and cold at the other end of the party. When I received my miso salmon served with white rice, it was served with a weird giant tortilla chip stuck in the fish. Because nothing says ""Asian Miso Salmon"" like a giant tortilla chip, right? The sauce on the fish was ridiculously salty, which was a general comment around the table-- ""my food is really salty.""  The Grand Lux Experience continued to deliver garbage. I pulled out a few fish bones from my mouth. The last straw was the bill. My husband and I paid almost $120 for 3 drinks and 2 entrees.

I was almost full after just that. Ordered the Sonoma salad, it was delicious, tho a bit heavy on the dressing, so do let them know when ordering if you want light dressing. My friend got the pork tenderloins and it was equally delicious. At last, we ordered the highly recommend New Orleans Beignets for desert, it's fried donuts with three different dipping sauces. They were so delicious!! The portion for this is huge (8 large donuts). Some of their deserts are freshly baked in their own bakery, so it takes about 20-30 minutes, order with your food if you can.

Which brings me to star number 1: this place is great for families. Lots of space, lots of large tables, and staff who know how to accommodate babies and tots. As is typical of chains of this size (they're related, apparently, to The Cheesecake Factory), the menu is gigantic. In fact, when you go to their website it says, ""Grand Lux Cafe: Something for Everyone!"" I ordered chilaquiles, knowing full well that they wouldn't be chilaquiles, but happy to have the egg and tortilla mix. I asked the waiter whether the beans in them were vegetarian. He didn't raise an eyebrow or look at me weird, he just said apologetically, ""No, I'm sorry they're not."" I asked him to omit them and put more avocado on, and he said great! Star number 2. When my food came out, it was scrambled (not fried!) eggs with tortilla chips (not lightly fried stale tortillas!) mixed in, topped with salsa (not stewed in it!), monterey jack cheese (not queso fresco!), avocado, and shredded tortilla chips in a little spindly tower shape. Like I said, not chilaquiles at all... BUT... um, it tasted good. Star number 3. And, finally, they have a dessert for which the are pretty well known, and it's really, really quite good. Beignets served with a vanilla cream, a chocolate sauce, and some raspberry compote. THEY ARE DELICIOUS. Star number 4.

See, beyond the burger and the desserts -- which I'll admit are really yummy -- I don't get the appeal of this place. Here's why: 1. It boasts a view of Michigan Ave. Yeah, for about 20 people. The place is cavernous and you often sit and get lost in the middle. It's an issue trying to find and get to the bathroom. 2. The confusion when you walk in. They greet you and you tell them your story, but they don't care, they send you through the wasted space up the escalator. They don't use their walkie headgear thingies to tell anyone you're coming. You may get seated after a bit of disorientation... 3. The wait for attention once you are seated. Hello, bread? Waters? If I'm going to wait an unbearably long time for my meal, sate me, would ya? 4. The tourists. They see the third-floor window views and pour in. They see the Cheesecake Factory-like atmosphere and feel right at home. But they are incapable of functioning in the city, and they really belong at the Sears/Willis Tower, where they can hang out with their mouths agape for as long as they want. 5. The music. It's so -- WHAT DID YOU SAY? -- loud. Turn it down. The place is too loud already. 6. The servers. Take some initiative. Remember my request. Act like you've done this before. Earn your tip. Skip it.

2010-04-24,4.0,"I began frequenting Grand Lux way back in college when my best friend and I would skip our courses for 4 courses (of food) and shopping. First of all, the restaurant decor is like stepping into a Gustav Klimt painting sans cloistered erotic vibe. It is definitely one of the reasons I love visiting. The two-seater booths near the windows are also a great feature. In other restaurants couples are forced to eat at tables, which are wedged in the corner or which have prime access to the loo. Here, couples can rejoice! They have dibs on a Michigan Avenue view. Although I feel the food is really upscale fast food, it does hit the spot when you are craving something scandalous to your diet.  I usually order the potato rolls and the spinach dip, both of which are notoriously yummy. I also love their desserts and martinis.  Unfortunately, the wait is usually unbearable and you are forced to interact with...*gasp*... tourists. You will recognize them because they are carrying American Girl purchases and have bags of Garretts popcorn. Avoid them at all costs, as they are dangerously annoying.",0.9516,0.749,0.16,0.091,0.46791666666666665
2010-04-22,3.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE the desserts here!!! I would give the desserts 5 stars. I have tried a lot of the desserts off the menu and none have let me down yet. Well actually.. maybe one which is the chocolate creme brulee. Its a bit too bitter for me. I always ask for the creme brulee duo to be both vanilla (usually comes with one vanilla and one chocolate). The rustic apple pie is to die for and is always so fresh! the molten chocolate cake is heavenly as well! I am giving Grand Lux 3 stars because I am not a big fan of their regular food. I have gotten the lasagna and it was an enormous amount of food but it was just mediocre. Full of cheese and mushroom. I wish it was more saucey and had more ground beef in there. I have tried their mini corndogs/ hot dogs and the outter corn layer was so buttery and oily. I could feel the oil dripping in my mouth. It was not very appetizing. A hot dog (ANYWHERE) else would have been better! Oh and they are overpriced  for such mediocre taste.,0.968,0.826,0.145,0.029,0.5557886557886557

2010-04-15,4.0,"Grand Lux, where do I begin? Well for starters, this is my favorite restaurant, however, I have to be honest: A few years ago, I went to Grand Lux Cafe for the first time and fell in love with it. The food was amazing, although I wasn't really a fan of the Chicken Pot Pie. Even better was the dessert! I declared the restaurant as my favorite and kept returning every time I could. The food was perfect every time. Until recently. In the past three times that I have went, I've noticed a significant decline in the food quality. I get the same thing, Short Ribs of Beef and Shrimp Scampi, so I would notice a change in the food. It just doesn't taste as good.  One time, the short ribs were overcooked, another time, the food wasn't seasoned (it tasted flavorless). And one time, my mom order a steak, and Grand Lux, known for their huge portions, brought her a steak about the size of a credit card. Yes, a credit card. So, the food has fallen off quite a bit in quality and taste, however, the dessert has stayed the same (which is why I'm keeping four stars on the rating). I am what you would call a sweet freak, so as long as the dessert is good, you will keep me as a fan. (and customer)",0.988,0.741,0.2,0.058,0.5966049382716051

The goat cheese salad was out of the world.. little fried balls of goat cheese nestled among baby greens and candied apples. Their roasted veggies pizza was surprisingly thin and good. The beignets that we had for dessert were truly fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth pieces of heaven.  I've heard great things about their brunch offerings too, planning to try that out soon.

2010-03-25,2.0,"Unfortunately I can't justify giving this place more than 2 stars due to the unsatisfactory service I experienced. I went for lunch with my coworkers a few months ago. We got up there and the crowd was lukewarm, so no reason to think there would be a problem. Well, it took forever for us to get our lunch. It must have been at least 40 minutes, maybe longer. And we ordered things like the lunch special (sandwich/soup combo). The only thing that might have taken longer was an order of fish and chips, but you could easily send out the other food and tell the one person that their order is coming out in just a bit. It was strange enough to make us wonder if they screwed up in back or forget about us. I ordered the lunch special, half chicken salad sandwich with broccoli cheddar soup, which also came with a delicious house salad. Portion was very large, and I would give the taste 3 stars.  Since it was running so late, I ordered my dessert to go: a piece of their dulce de leche cheesecake (of course from the Cheesecake Factory). Can't screw that up, right? Let me back up for just a minute. When the fish and chips were ordered, the waitress was careful to mention that the dipping sauce had peanut in it, in case there were any allergy concerns. Anyway, so we're waiting for the one slice of cheesecake, and waiting... How hard is it to scoop it up and put it in a container? So I finally get the damn thing and it has nuts sprinkled all over the top! And the menu DOES NOT mention anything about nuts! It looked like walnuts, but I can never tell. I HATE walnuts and I do have an allergy to some type of tree nut that tastes like a peanut, and because I'm not sure I always avoid nuts (except I'm fine with almonds and regular peanuts). I think what bothered me the most was our server's ""la dee da"" attitude. Don't come over and tell me ""it'll be out in just a minute"", and then immediately go over to the next table and start chit-chatting. Take the 5 minutes to go get me my cheesecake so I can get out of here! All negativity aside, the menu has loads of variety, although that's not always a good thing cause it makes your decision harder. And the decor is beautiful - take a moment to look up at the ceiling.  Word of advice: if you're visiting Chicago and on the Mag Mile, and you need to decide where to go for lunch or dinner, please skip this place - you'll have a better experience elsewhere.

2010-03-16,4.0,"I have to tell you about my amazing experience at Grand Lux Cafe yesterday.  I have always loved Grand Lux -- they have great food, a huge menu, awesome desserts, and professional service -- but yesterday was truly the type of service that you expect from a 5-star restaurant/hotel. I recently discovered that gluten, dairy, and soy are all migraine triggers for me so I've been on an elimination diet.  Avoiding one of these is tough, but all three can be impossible.  If you walk into a restaurant and tell them that you are allergic to all of those things, they usually freak and tell you that all they can give you is a plain chicken breast and a side salad.  So at Grand Lux I tried to order the Lunch Enchiladas without cheese or sour cream and timidly mention my allergies.  Of course, at the mention of the word ""allergy"", the server immediately called over the manager who I later learned was the head manager of the entire restaurant. He listened carefully to my allergies and told me that most of their dishes would be a bad idea because most of their sauces contained thickening agents with soy or gluten.  Instead of freaking out and leaving me with the dreaded tasteless plate, he asked me about what I liked and told me that he'd take care of me.  About 15 minutes later, the most beautiful and enormous plate of food arrived.  It contained a pan-seared chicken breast, not totally bland and plain, but amazingly tasteful and well-seasoned, fresh-steamed and seasoned broccoli spears, the most delicious, flavorful carrots, and mashed sweet potatoes.  On the side, they presented me with two allergen-free sauce choices: one was a spicy tomato salsa, and one was a sweet mango salsa.  The manager said that he had double checked both of them to ensure they were both OK.  I was completely speechless (because I was holding back tears of joy) and completely satisfied.  Oh, and my server was great too.  Thanks, J! If you're reading this review and thinking, ""I don't get why what they did is such a big deal,"" compare it to these two other experiences.  1. The ONLY thing that's safe for me to eat at Panera is an apple.  They put gluten, soy, or dairy in EVERYthing else.  2. A restaurant that had both ""hand-made"" pub chips and potato salad on the menu was unable to bring me a plain baked potato. When I left the restaurant, I was so happy and relaxed that I felt like I had spent the afternoon at the spa.  Thank you, Grand Lux for making my day!!!",0.9973,0.747,0.196,0.057,0.592049319727891

They have 312 on tap---which I love, because I always drink the local beers while traveling---and that alone warrants a ""meh"" rating over ""eek!""  It was $5.50, too, which is not bad at all for a popular Michigan Avenue restaurant.  I had the mushroom veggie burger sub salad (instead of fries).  The burger was not cooked thoroughly---which isn't particularly dangerous because it's meat- and dairy-free, although it makes it rather less savory than it should be---and messy.  The bun was absolutely slathered with butter.  The side salad was mostly iceberg lettuce---blecch, tasteless---but the balsamic vinaigrette was not bad at all.

And I don't feel obligated to order a slice of cheesecake at the end of my meal. The last time we came to GLC, there was no wait downstairs, but a little bit of a traffic jam at the end of the hallway upstairs. There was some confusion about our table so they made us wait for another five minutes. Good things come to those who wait. We were seated in one of the coveted window booths. These seats offer a view of Michigan Ave as if we were sitting on top of the world looking down at all pedestrians below unlike CF a few blocks away with its subterranean feel. Our server was not only courteous and helpful, but also very entertaining. We ordered from the minis, bites ,and tapas section: fried calamari and mini pork carnitas and crispy mahi mahi tacos. And to complete our custom made combo platter, we added duck potstickers and a mini rustic margherita pizza. Everything was fresh and delicious. To end our meal, we ordered the strawberry shortcake which was probably the best I've ever had. Creamy vanilla ice cream was sandwiched between golden tender shortcake. A cascade of strawberry sauce chock full of fresh fruit finished the dessert. And we finished the dessert. A perfect ending to our meal. If you want something very special for dessert choose the made to order desserts which require 30 minutes. They include molten chocolate cake, New Orleans beignets, and apple pie just to name a few.

The decor, sure, was done up a little better, and the prices were adjusted up a little bit.  But the menu's are nearly identical. Why did I say I've experienced better? Because out of curiosity I had a dish here that's one of my favorites at  Cheesecake Factory.  It was served VERY differently in a manner which made it worse.  Really you can't get shrimp scampi right?

Like The Cheesecake Factory, Grand Lux has a huge menu.  This includes lots of lunch combos.  Prices are not bad at all considering the location.  I'm pretty sure I got the same thing both times - some kind of chicken wrap that I can definitely only make it half way through before I pack the rest up for next days' lunch.  I'd be willing to bet that most of the food, like CF, is good but not mind-blowing.  But that's not really why you're here.

I stuffed myself and I shared and I still had food leftover to take home. To top it all off, we ordered the beignets for dessert. I don't know why but I've been craving beignets for about 3 weeks now so when I finally got them I was in heaven!

I thought that the things you could do with flour were amazing... and the way you handled that powdered sugar on top was so delicate! The cream sauce left the perfect finishing taste in my mouth.

They have dishes from throughout the world, ranging from pizza and burgers to more exotic dishes. There are a handful of very good vegetarian options, and all my carnivore friends were quite pleased with their dishes. The coffee is great, and they have some fine beers on draft. The other thing that makes the Grand Lux what it is, are the deserts. Their creme brulee is fantastic, not to mention my absolute favorite, the red velvet cake. The desert here is so good, that I would literally go downtown and catch two trains to get here just to have a bite of cake. Yum.

Hands down this place has the absolute BEST chocolate chip cookies in the country.  There is nothing that can compare to a box of warm freshly baked Chocolate Chip Pecan Cookies that just melt in your mouth making you wish you could savor every last morsel for eternity.  The Beignets and Molten Chocolate Cake are equally rich and decadent and treat your taste buds with proper respect and dignity. Unfortunately this is where the happy story ends.  Their menu - a fusion of world flavors and styles - is just average at best. When you think of the cliché 'jack of all trades master of none', this is the only way you could define Grand Lux.  All dishes from their pastas, to seafood, to asian fusion are just mediocre at best.  There's no grandeur you would expect; in fact I find Cheesecake dishes to be more refined because in certain respect less is more.  Grand Lux is trying too hard to mix all different flavors into something that may really dazzle you but ultimately only fizzes into a concoction your taste buds simply do not agree with.

But now I'm a hypocrite, because for some crazy reason, I actually really liked this place.  Yes, I know it's the Cheesecake Factory's 'upscale' big brother.  But for the price point, quantity of chow, and quality of execution, I have a hard time faulting Grand Lux for anything, other than being a major league sell-out (but who isn't nowadays). First of all, the food was actually really good.  Our chicken summer rolls, which were an abomination of thousands of years of beautiful Vietnamese culinary tradition, actually were quite tasty, fresh, and crunchy.  My  Carolina style pulled pork sandwich was about as authentic as a Milli Vanilli record, but fuck-it, actually tasted pretty good.  And at $12, it was a ridiculous bargain.  These guys must run drugs out the back door, because I don't know how they're turning a profit. And the service.  Given it's the midwest, but people were nice.  So godamn, frustratingly, resentfully, perplexedly, fucking nice.  Whether it be the hostess, the busboy, or our waiter, they were all so annoyingly pleasant.  No eye-rolls when I asked for a salad instead of fries.  No sighs or tight-lipped smiles when my dining partner asked for a vegetable soup instead of her fries.  No indignation when I asked for an iced-coffee (not on the menu).  Just willing cooperation, pleasant demeanor, and nearly flawless service.   Giving a glowing endorsement of this place pains me unbelievably.  But in this case, credit is due for what it's worth.",0.9821,0.672,0.21,0.118,0.6113425925925925

I love this place, I would go here everyday since there is enough to choose from to have a different meal everytime (same owner as Cheesecake Factory). We waited 15 min at 1230 lunch time, not bad. We went upstairs to the bar and by the time we got our drinks, we were seated. The decor in this place alone is worth the visit, unreal! It's casual, yet classic. Comfy seats, booths, bar stools, everything is comfy. We were served by Mary, who was just the sweetest thing, and got a very good tip for her efforts. I can totally appreciate fantastic service, and she delivered. We ordered the Beignets and the Choc Molten Cake since they are made to order (30 minutes). We were hungry and our eyes were bigger than our bellies, so we had two days of leftovers plus desserts for under 80 bucks! We got the Chicken Lettuce Wraps for appetizer, and they were ok. Good by anyones standards, really they were, but just good. I ordered the Short Rib Grilled Cheese with fries... slow roasted short ribs, caramelized onion and creamy melted fontina cheese on grilled country bread. This is not just a Panini people... this is a masterpiece, a perfect combination of flavor and texture. Awesome. The boy got the Pasta Telephono - Penne with tomato sauce with a dash of cream and melted mozzarella cheese then baked with toasted bread crumbs. Also good, but pasta is the same to me everywhere. Good crunchy top for texture and the sauce was pretty tasty, al dente. Good nuff. So then we got our New Orleans Beignets and Molten Chocolate Cake. I'm a dessert girl, I wait for it and I love it very much, the boy feels EXACTLY the same way about the sweet finish. So we're perfect for each other. I think I asked sweet Mary with my eyes alone, that she best not speak to me while I enjoy these delicate, airy, soft, sweet, hot New Orleans donuts. Served with Choc, Rasp and Jack Daniels sweet cream sauce. Need I say more? There were like 8 of them, are you kidding me??!???!! I felt as though I had died and gone to hog heaven! The cake was fabulous as always - perfectly done with its gooey hot choc center that oozes onto the plate and melts the vanilla ice cream its served with. Another one bites the dust!

This place is always crowded but there are plenty of good reasons why. If you haven't gone to Grand Lux Cafe on a weekend, you must. What people do not realize is that they also have some of the best breakfast food that you can find (in my opinion of course), and you can only get it here on Saturdays and Sundays from when the restaurant opens until about 2:30pm. The brioche french toast plain or with strawberries are amazing and the pancakes are so good, they can stimulate the economy. The different types of omelettes are not a bad choice as well. If you are a fan of burgers or even pasta, you should love this place. One problem I have with this place is accessibility obviously, it's in the middle of downtown so your best bet is to park in the parking facility on Ohio street, because if you use the valet service you will be waiting about 15-20 minutes for your car. It will take you 5-10 minutes to walk to the parking lot and get your car while paying less at the same time once you get your parking validated.  Other than that, you won't find it too much different than the Cheesecake Factory, which was created by the same people.

We waited for around 20 minutes for a table, which wasn't that bad considering we had no reservations. Once our name was called, they took us to another waiting area, where we stood there for an additional 15 minutes. Once we were seated, we ordered our lunch. I went for the Fish and Chips, and my fiance had a salad. We weren't served for another 40-45 minutes. I didn't think it would take that long to fry some fish and toss a salad!

The food comes in very ""grand"" proportions (like my play on words? jk).  We ordered the buffalo crisps as an appetizer and I had the tomato, garlic chicken pasta.  Not a good idea for lunch nor was it a good idea when I wasn't even that hungry to begin with.  I hardly put a dent in it, which is abnormal because I can usually finish everything regardless of how big.  Don't get me wrong though.  It was really tasty!  I would just really think twice about ordering anything here without the intention of sharing amongst others.  My girlfriends did the same thing...ordered their own thing and hardly ate any of it.  We spent about $20 a person.  If I was eating this at home somewhere, it would have been nice because I would have had plenty of left overs, which would have meant my $20 would have stretched far. However, I ended up wasting a lot of food, which is very unfortunate.  Moral of the story?  Don't order your own meal.  At least have one other person to share with!",0.9689,0.839,0.128,0.033,0.5327380952380952

It probably helps that the place is huge. Our server did a nice job, but he was too chatty for my taste. The portions here are HUGE. I got a club sandwich. It was too fat to fit my mouth around. The tomatoes were almost pink rather than red, The bacon didn't have much flavor, and the turkey had a dry texture, which means they don't use the best ingredients. So as a foodie, I would say I could pass on this place. As a city girl who works down the street, it's convenient for lunch.",0.8845,0.828,0.138,0.033,0.5408994708994709

For starters we had the lettuce wraps. They were good, but way too many of those dried noodle things. Not sure if I would order them again. For dinner, my husband had an awesome chicken dish. It was like orange chicken but better. I was really jealous that I didn't get it. I had the pasta with sundried tomatos and veggies and chicken and it was tasty. They do the desserts made to order (at least the baked ones). We opted for the apple tart which was amazing. I had it with a hot choclate and it was perfect.

Sandwiches, seafood, pasta, salads and meat... all prepared a dozen different ways. We started with the perfectly seared tuna, which was served with a mild wasabi sauce. What happened to your kick, Mr. Wasabi? He was a no-show.  Dinner: Andy ordered a pasta dish and I had the spicy chicken flatbread sandwich. OMGhugeportions. I somehow managed to put away almost half of my sandwich. Can we say, glutton? Flatbread, chicken, pepperjack, avocado, corn salsa. And mmm, tasty seasoned fries. Tomorrow's lunch has been served.

It's overrun with tourists and herds of folks from the outer-reaches of suburbia who make a trek into the city to see Wicked, but, sonofabitch, I love me some Grand Lux Cafe.  The food portions are gargantuan which is really a good thing. You can share, you can have leftovers, or, *ahem* you can be a big greedy hog and eat everything in front of you..not that I've done that there. Me? No, never.

I am not a big desert person. I don't have a sweet tooth perse, I don't crave chocolate or eat ice cream by the pint full, but I cannot ever possibly leave GLC without ordering dessert, specifically the banana cream pie and/or the beignets. Oh who the hell am I kidding, I order them both! The banana cream pie is creamy and cool, the crust is flaky and buttery and the bananas are always the perfect texture. The beignets will make you pass out; served hot with a side of raspberry sauce and warmed up chocolate sauce, and honey. Honey, you'll reach over and slap your dining companion they're so good. GLC is situated right at Michigan Ave. and Ontario, and during the holiday season it's a really magical place.

Someone in our party of four, yelled across the table after an hour of various girly cheers were lofted from the bar, 'why would anyone have their bachelorette party here?' This is grand in scale but it's not lux, IMHO! The food is acceptable but when we paraded past the many various food stations and were witness to the plates in various stages of prep-work, I should have known better.  I allowed myself a burger and was highly disappointed. Come on people. The cheddar cheese slice was so thin that it was transparent and lacked flavor as did the bacon, and I LOVE BACON. When I allow myself the treat of a burger I expect taste. I ended up slathering on mustard and mayo. Some may consider that a sacrilege to a burger but I had to taste something. Who knows how long the burger and fries sat at a prep station but that's probably why the fries were inedible. You know they're bad, if I don't eat the fries. Did I eat the burger, yes. It was A-OK but it wasn't wow and I didn't think a tasty Angus burger with cheddar cheese and bacon is too much to ask for from a chain restaurant but it is.  My friends were pleased with their salmon three ways (great portion size and flavor match-ups); veal and chicken dishes were massive in portion size and they cleaned their plates, so maybe I'm just too picky.  Seriously, this place is LOUD. The floor is slick. I was amazed that no one fell and cracked their @$$ on that slippery floor.  Service - I met the bottom of my water glass early in the meal after polishing off my Berry Fizz (non-alcohol drink). My water was NEVER refilled nor was I asked if I wanted another Berry drink.  3 of the 4 ordered the desserts before dinner and after our dinner plates were cleared, I had to ask twice for a dessert menu so that I could order.  Desserts are delicious to a touch over-done. Their banana bread with chocolate chips and sauce is served with whipped cream. Save the chocolate for another dessert folks and heat this one up and serve with a scoop of ice cream and carmel sauce and you've got a home run.  Apple pie a huge plate full and a lovely presentation and the Beignets are fried fresh, airy and covered in powered sugha served with three dipping sauces. A-ok but nothing overly spectacular.

And whereas they used to prepare it well....it's definitely gone downhill. Mediocre.  Grand Lux has been packing in the crowds for 3 years now and the wear and tear is showing. Two large pieces of wallpaper were dangling from the wall going up the escalator-amateurish attempts to stick it back up with scotch tape had failed. Light fixtures were a little askew. The bathroom was in great need of attention. Little, telling signs. Why arent they getting a maintenance crew in there to spiff it back up?  But the worst is the people going there. WAY too many kids and teenagers. I like kids and teens, I have two of my own, but too many is ...too many. Hate the strollers. And worst of all...the Grand Lux is attracting the riff raff.

2008-08-02,4.0,"I've been making bi-annual trips to Grand Lux Cafe, usually when I'm in the mood for a nice dinner at a price that is affordable with food that makes me feel as if I've outdone myself. For everything that Grand Lux encompasses, I really should hate it: tourists who venture for a day in the city from destinations as far away as Wilmette and Glenview, the popularity of the place just because it's owned by the Cheesecake Factory, and every single parent who took their daughter to the American Girl Store treating their child to a late lunch. I don't hate the Grand Lux, because the food and service make you forget all of this stuff. The waiters are not too frou-frou, acting as if they're serving in a restaurant 3x as expensive, they know what they serve and that's that. The food-- from salad to dessert-- is immaculate. My favorite appetizer salad is the house salad, because it's so simple yet just enough before the main course (and how many restaurants can you really call a house salad your favorite?) Recently, I had the Chicken Royale, which was perfectly cooked, perfectly breaded, and served with what I thought were the best damn mashed potatoes. The green beans were also unforgettable, and these are green beans we're talking about. Also, for $26 you can get an excellent merlot, which complemented everything perfect. I doubt it was just a day of good choices from the menu; it doesn't take a lot of money to have a good dinner, although it does take a lot to impress me with a restaurant. For all the bad things that Grand Lux attracts, it serves everything else just right, and not overdone. My one complaint-- and it's a small one-- is that if you do not get a booth, you will most likely be stuck sitting inches away from that wonderful couple from Wilmette treating their kid to a post-American Girl dinner; I certainly  appreciate the intimacy of French cafe seating, but we're in Chicago (god love this city) and this is not the type of environment where you want to be seated inches away from someone. Still, I suggest you go, and make sure you're able to carry around a doggy bag afterwards; you will need it.",0.9839,0.838,0.127,0.035,0.6291839199447896

Miso Salmon - nothing like the Cheesecake Factory version, which I actually like.  This one should have been called ""soy sauce salmon""--it had a salty brown-sauced top. Banana Cream Pie - this is served as an individual tart.  It was actually pretty good for a Cheesecake Factory dessert, which I usually find to be too sweet.  It was barely sweet!  Half of the filling was whipped cream, so when we scraped that all off, we ended up with lots of banana and a bit of custard.  The graham crust was crunchy and just sweet enough (although a little too crunchy to bite in some areas).

Unfortunately, I'm prompted to write about an instance of horrible service I received at Grand Lux on June 22nd for brunch.  I had just proposed to my girlfriend that morning, and I had planned for us to come to Grand Lux to recommemerate our first date together here.  We were seated fairly quickly, and were excited to enjoy brunch together again.  Joel G, our server, stopped by to introduce himself and let us know in detail what the soups of the day were, and then left us to look over the menus.  From here, the service dropped horribly... Upon his return, my fiancee asked him if he could repeat what the soup options were again.  He looked at her and simply replied ""chicken or vegetable.""  Perplexed, she asked again to get some clarification and again he looked at her and with attitude replied ""chicken or vegetable.""  Instead of pressing the issue, she let it go and just ordered the chicken soup. Part way through the meal, he stopped by to see how we were doing, and I asked if he would mind taking a picture of us.  I was about to explain that we had just got engaged this morning however before I could, he cut me off and stated ""Actually, I do mind taking a picture of you right now.  I'm busy with a lot of tables and don't have my head on straight yet.""  With that, he left the table. After he dropped off the check and I began filling out the tip portion of the bill, he made his way over to our table again and told me ""Give me your camera.""  When he was taking the picture, he looked at me and said ""What, no smile?""  It seems my annoyance with our waiter was a bit too obvious. I am very disappointed at the service we received from Joel G.  Even in the event that this was not the day I proposed to my girlfriend, this level of customer service is ridiculous.  While I understand a waitstaff must be efficient, his actions and words left no doubt that customer service was far from his list of priorities.  In fact, his coincidence of coming back in telling me to ""Give me your camera"" while I was writing the tip portion was likely not so much of a coincidence. My fiancee has suggested that we never come back to Grand Lux, and I have assured her that this is simply an individual problem, not an issue with the restaurant itself.  I hope that my defense of the Grand Lux is an accurate one...  Unfortunately, the brunch of our engagement day is likely to leave a bad taste in both our mouths for a long time to come due to the inadequacies of one waiter.   All in all, I love the food here... but this one bad experience has truly caused me to reconsider bringing guests here.

Basically it is like the Cheescake Factory with a slightly different menu and not quite as many dessert choices. The most recent time I was here I had a cobb salad that was very sub par.

Its price compliments the hearty servings, but the same thing that has turned me off to the Cheesecake Factory, turns me off here.

Again, the food is good, but an institution that serves burgers, Asian stir-fry, and lasagna all at once seems just a bit...pretentious. The attempt is more than laudable, but the outcome falls a tad short. I would rather the menu be more focused for I have no doubt that the food makers in the back have the talent and skill to hone on specialties (which there are a few). I want to see more of that. With their attempts to please everybody, they in turn draw in everybody. Meaning, when we visited, it seems like the entire Chicago Loop population was crammed into the restaurant and lobby. Yeah, it has a freakin lobby. This tells me that masses of people visit here, which tells me it's probably a bit overrated.  I hope I'm not sounding like a hater, because I really did enjoy my visit.

2008-04-20,5.0,"My husband and I have probably eaten at Grand Lux Caf more than any other place in Chicago.  Usually we go for an early lunch or a late dinner in order to avoid the crowds and long wait times, because yes if you are trying to get a table here on a Friday or Saturday night you can expect wait about two hours.   I love it here because it has something for everyone - salads, sandwiches, pastas, chicken and steaks - pretty much whatever you are in the mood for they will have it in some form on the menu.  Works great for us most of the time because it seems that one of us is always on a ""diet"" so we go here so the dieter can get a yummy salad while the other can order a delicious fatty meal.   I love the sourdough bread they bring out to you before you get your meal - they usually bring you both white and wheat bread which is good for my husband and I because he (being the more healthy eater of our duo) is into wheat and I am into white so thus we are never fighting over the last piece of bread.    Between my hubby and I we have probably sampled almost everything on the menu and have never had a dish we have not liked.  My hubby's favorite dish is the spicy flatbread chicken sandwich.  My favorites are the burger melt, pasta del sol and the buffalo chicken rolls.  I would also recommend the southwest chicken salad and the stuffed potato spring rolls!  Portions are fairly large so a meal along with the bread they give you usually leaves you pretty full.    Last time I was here I got the Grand Lux Burger Melt and wow it was absolutely delicious!  I think part of the reason I loved it so much was because the bread it was on was not the traditional hamburger bun but some crispy parmesan flat bread that was yummy yummy!  With all the ""meat"" restaurants around Grand Lux (ie Webber Grill) I was pleasantly surprised to be so satisfied by a burger here.    The best seats in the house are the ones that are overlooking Michigan and the last time we ate here we were lucky enough to snag one of the coveted booths that did just that which was really nice even for us city folk who witness the splendor that is the magnificent mile on a daily basis.     Oh I should also mention that on our recent trips to Grand Lux we have had an infant in tow along with a decent size stroller.  The staff has been extremely accommodating and friendly about seating us in a booth so that our lil baby can sit in her car seat with us while she eats.  Also, there is an elevator that can easily be taken up to the dining area which is very helpful to us.  One time we were here the elevator was broken which was mildly annoying, but we were able to get the stroller and baby up the escalators without much of a problem.  So, even with the crowds that can develop here, I would say that it is a very kid friendly restaurant that definitely makes us even more likely to be back many times in the future!",0.9985,0.794,0.188,0.018,0.5748129251700679

The chicken pot pie isn't bad and you can usually find me munching on the Asian chicken salad or a burger/sandwich. The food overall is probably 3.5 but the dessert is definitely a 4.

I can only think of two places that I've ever gone where the fries were just a fresh as the burger...Ruby Tuesday (believe it or not!) and J. Alexanders. My friend had the salmon and i saw some steamed veggies and some mashed sweet potatoes on her plate. She enjoyed her meal. We skipped on dessert... All in all being here reminded of me being at the Cheesecake Factory, which I'm not a 5 star fan of (menu is WAAAYYY too big)....the ambiance was cool, nice view of Michigan Avenue from where we sat. Going to the bathroom was like going on a journey! I don't know that I would go back, if I did, someone would have to be treating me!

Go on a Monday, or a Thursday- you'll get the same great food, and better service. I think this is also when a lot of the people from the city go here.

You have to remember that this place is huge, and even when its not full, there are still a lot of people there.

I've never had the salads, I see them being complimented on this board, but a tasty array of veggies and dressing is hardly enough to rate more than a star in my book.",-0.128,0.849,0.069,0.081,0.4395833333333334
2006-02-05,3.0,"I know it's a chain, but it's one of my favorite places to get a salad.  It's owned by the same people as cheesecake factory, but I find the quality of the food much better. However, you can tell it's in the same restaurant family by the portion sizes...their salads are huge!  There is always a wait, no matter what time it is, but it's right off Michigan Avenue so I just usually shop around while I wait.  Great cookies as well so save some room for dessert or take them to go!",0.9769,0.727,0.247,0.026,0.5232142857142856
2006-02-01,5.0,"This relative of the Cheesecake Factory has huge portions and tons of choices.  The menu is almost overwhelming with all the options to choose from.  The Asian Chicken Salad is spectacular and the Mushroom Burger is amazing.  Other favorites include their breakfast/brunch pancakes, and their sandwiches are great.  Located above Michigan Avenue, it's the perfect lunch/dinner spot to take a break from shopping or the crowds.",0.9493,0.782,0.218,0.0,0.6249999999999999
2005-10-22,4.0,"I love this place and the decor inside the massive space. The salads here are great. If you come here for lunch, make sure to order the lunch portions which are huge. This place can get pretty crazy on weekends so be prepared for a bit of a wait. You can peruse the extensive menu while you wait for your table - it will take a while to get through the entire thing.",0.9421,0.747,0.224,0.029,0.7774691358024692
2005-08-19,4.0,"A classier version of the Cheesecake factory - the sangria was smacking good and the food portions were pretty generous and delish.  Try one of their made to order dessert - we always just have to get something - last time, we got their chocolate chip cookies and the molten chocolate cake!  The crispy chicken flautas are pretty good too and when it says ""large dinner salad"" - expect a VOLCANO of salad on your plate.  Easy location to get to and plenty to do around the area - take a break from shopping on the Magnificent Mile and get a drink and a cookie!",0.9715,0.794,0.206,0.0,0.7198412698412698
2005-08-17,4.0,"This places association with Cheesecake Factory is pretty obvious -- you'll find great serivce, good food, big portions, and great desserts here as well. But do plan on a hefty wait -- I have never gone here without having to wait at least an hour to get seated for dinner. But I think the wait is worth it if you are with a big group -- you'll enjoy your meal in this casual, yet upscale setting and you'll also get a very cool view of the city!",0.9761,0.735,0.265,0.0,0.5426388888888888
2005-08-03,4.0,"This place is awesome but is very easy to miss. Look for the Ann Taylor shop and look up. We spent a good amount of time circling around and parking can be a mess, but that's expected with any foray into downtown Chicago. This place is awesome. They stop seating guests at 12:30am and they welcome large groups. The menu items are fabulous and the interior is SO elegant. You must come here. They are related to the Cheesecake Factory but the menu options are a bit more varied. The menu will please anyone as it samples from a wide variety of world cuisines. Highly recommended for the food and the views.",0.9847,0.683,0.258,0.059,0.6295714285714287
