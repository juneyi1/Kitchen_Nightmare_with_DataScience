2017-09-02,4.0,Had an 8pm reservation and we were seated immediately. Upon sitting we were given bread to start with. The bread was very good and fresh.

2017-08-31,4.0,"Came here for a Groupon deal and boy was I glad! I got the lobster pasta with pink sauce as well as the Gnocchi in Pesto sauce and they were both amazing. The Gnocchi pasta was cooked to the perfect texture and the pesto sauce was delicious and so refreshing, I couldn't have enough of it.  We also saved room for dessert and got the tiramisu which was good. It wasn't the best tiramisu I've tried, could have something to do with the cream being just a tad bit dense and not as airy and light as I would've liked. But all in all, it was good and we finished every last bite.  I would definitely recommend this place to a friend and would come back for their pastas.",0.9849,0.731,0.246,0.023,0.6177777777777779

This time, I used the half birthday coupon. When I dined here last time, it was on the first floor. I was under the impression that it was a small one-story Italian restaurant. Little did I know, there is a much bigger second floor! We were seated on the second floor this time, which is bad timing because my calves were hurting from running a few days prior. I literally had to walk down a long flight of stairs one step at a time like an old lady. Like most Italian restaurants, we were served bread before the meal. Of course like most times, I dominated the loaf of bread thus leaving me unable to finish my entrée. We both ordered the Linguini alle Vongole for $24.99 each, which is homemade pasta, clams, garlic, onion, and white wine olive oil sauce. This was an absolutely delicious and savory dish and was a massive portion. You can definitely tell the pasta was freshly made. This entrée is great for two people if you don't want leftovers. My friend ordered a tiramisu, which was good but had too much white cream at the top. We were served by a Robb Stark look-alike from Game of Thrones, and that was all I could think about every time he came by our table. Speaking of, I'm looking forward to this Sunday's episode.

2017-07-28,5.0,"Simply Amazing! Everything here is effortless! The service, the food, the atmosphere.....phenomenal! It opens at 4:30pm and I'm happy my friend and I showed up then because it felt like we had the place to ourselves and it was delightful. The restaurant itself is small and cozy and we sat next to the window letting in an amber glow of sunlight, where we talked for 2 1/2 hours and shared appetizers. We were served by the bartender and he  anticipated our needs and made detailed suggestions that insured a great meal was ahead of us.  First up were the Mussels in White Wine Sauce: the Pinot Grigio broth was light and flavorful, the spices perfectly balanced and not at all salty. The crostini were firm and crisp, soaking up the broth quite nicely and not falling apart. The mussels were small, but there were a lot of them in the serving, so the numbers made up for the size. Next, we shared the creamy Burrata Pugliese with crostini, oven roasted tomatoes, and prosciutto. All the ingredients were tasty on their own, but I couldn't help combing them into a scrumptious open-faced sandwich. Yum..... We ended our meal with the delicate and delectable Panna Cotta. I personally have never tried panna cotta before and found this to be super creamy and smooth--perfectly executed and rich enough to share.  Yelp check-ins get a free cappuccino (which my friend enjoyed immensely) and we left full and ready to come back again.

I can't remember all of the different dishes that were served, but I didn't have complaints about any of them. Of the appetizers, the most memorable for me were the crostini di avocado and the grilled calamari. The avocado tasted fresh, and the bread was nicely balanced between crunchy and chewy. I really liked the texture of the grilled calamari and the sauce that it was served in. Both salads - insalata Stella and insalata rustica - were refreshing and perfectly dressed. I loved the fresh apple slices in the Stella and the avocado in the rustica. The Stella was more popular among my fellow diners, so I ate only one serving. I would have liked to have more of that one! For pastas, we were served the bucatini carbonara and the cappellacci di zucca. I absolutely loved the second one. Pasta stuffed with pumpkin and served with butternut squash and pine nuts... I could not get enough! It was unique, and I hadn't eaten something like that before. This dish came out hot, and the pasta was just a little bit crispy. It was the best food I ate that night, and I would definitely order that again! I also enjoyed the risotto pescatore, and I would have eaten more of that if I wasn't already stuffed! Finally, the little bit of fruit tart that I had for dessert was delicious. I wish I had more room in my tummy to try more of the sweets! The staff was very attentive and professional. My glass was never empty, and my plates were cleared quickly.

They have a ton of options, ranging from traditional pasta dishes to seafood to lamb. I ordered the lobster ravioli, which had about ten ravioli pieces covered by a tomato cream sauce. I had high expectations, but it wasn't what I expected. I could barely taste the lobster and the cream sauce was a bit too sour for my taste. My boyfriend had the lamb chops, which were fantastic.

I'll agree with other reviewers, their Linguini alla Vongole is good; the pasta is hearty, but white sauce saltier than need be, I'll probably order something different next time. My boyfriend ordered Risotto pescatore, which he said was decent. I love the mussels in that dish.  I've ordered the Zuppe di Pesce in the past, which can definitely feed two. It wasn't my favorite thing, and although it seems many people enjoyed it, I  didn't like it as much as I hoped because of the overcooked salmon that seemed to throw off the already tasty flanked of the shellfish.

Wish he had mentioned that we could do half orders of the pasta because we ended up only ordering one and was not impressed. - Burrata Pugliese:  simple but refined. Love the sweet, creaminess of the cheese, the saltiness of the prosciutto. crunch from the toast, and the tartness from the tomatoes. - Calamari: This breading layer was thin and crunchy, but was just too salty. And the calamari was overcooked and rubbery. The marinara sauce was really good though. - Pasta Contadino: This pasta dish was bland and ordinary. Nothing really stood out about it..  - Lamb chops: Came with 6 chops, probably the best part of our meal.. The tangy tomato sauce paired really well with the lamb and some wine. And the lamb was cooked perfectly to a medium rare. Service was good but food was lacking.. Honestly, we should have stuck with the house specialties instead of the recommendations..

My wife and I came here for a date night on a Saturday night. It was surprisingly easy to get a reservation mid-week, and I think you can even get one for a decent time day of on yelp.  To start we got the mussels and a bottle of red wine. The wine list has a huge range of prices, some of which are pretty cheap, so that's a definite plus. The muscles were good, but nothing amazing.  I actually expected a little better, but I think it's because I'm used to a more French version with a cream sauce. For the entree my wife got the lobster ravioli and I got the spaghetti with red sauce and assorted seafood. My pasta was very good, but I got it spicy, and it was a little too spicy for Italian food. It was still good, but I wished I had gotten normal. My wife's ravioli was flat out amazing. The waiter said it was one of the most popular items on the menu, and it's obvious why.

Heck, other than as a body-limitation, even the smallness adds to the remarkably intimate atmosphere. The menu is focused and yet flexible, the meals were fantastic, the service is personable and unforced, and the wine menu is killer and surprisingly affordable given that you're eating in Lincoln Park. We came for a friend's birthday and left half-drunk and fully sated and completely impressed. Next time through Chicago, there will be an encore.",0.9223,0.815,0.141,0.044,0.49863945578231295
2017-06-11,5.0,"Only just came to Sapori Trattoria last week after having had it on my list for a long time, and was very surprised by the quality of the food. Not to say that I was expecting anything bad, but I've been underwhelmed by Italian frequently in the past; this was not the case here. We ordered two pasta dishes, a the gnocchi al brivido and the zuppa di pesce. The gnocchi had a perfect balance of ingredients; you could tell everything was made that day with none of the oiliness or mushiness that you may have in other iterations of the dish. The Zuppa di Pesce is a fantastic dish and a safe bet to order if you've never been there before. It's also one of their most expensive at $34, but the portion size is very large and serves minimum 2(possibly 3). It has freshly soft homemade linguine in a balanced seafood tomato broth, and is topped with generous amounts of mussels, squid, shrimp, and scallops. The pasta noodle itself was genuinely a step above; you could tell it was recently made. This, like most of their other dishes, may also be served in a half-portion($26), but you may as well just spring for the full.  While the prices per dish are a little higher than I'm used to, the quality you get for each dish is generally high enough that I'll look past that. And that said, they usually offer a Groupon which knocks $20 off your bill, making it a perfectly affordable and delicious option for a dinner for 2. 4 stars without the discount, 5 stars with.",0.9894,0.864,0.128,0.008,0.5126825396825397

I will say this, we ordered calamari as an appetizer and they brought two out because they said the first batch wasn't ""up to par"".

2017-06-05,5.0,"To say we had a good experience here is not giving it enough credit. I made reservations with the restaurant about three weeks in advance for 6 people and last minute had to change them to be for just 4 people due to a family circumstance. They were extremely accommodating. We arrived early for our reservation and they seated us after about ten minutes of waiting. It was obvious their dinner rush was just starting, but the hostesses were kind and attentive to every person that walked through the door. Immediately after being seated, our server came to our table. I believe her name was Gia. She was wonderful, answering all of our questions and remembered that the reservation had been made as a celebration of my mom's graduation from her master's program. They even gave my mom a personalized menu with her name on it. Now what everyone is really wondering, the food. Well other than the fresh and hot bread that was constantly being brought to our table and the olive oil and cheese to dip it in, we started with the Burrata Pugliese. It was absolutely delicious and I did not want to share with my family. After the appetizer, we moved on to the main course. We had asked our waitress what her favorites were and she described basically the whole menu. Her thoughts about the food were super helpful and she gave great tips. You could also tell that she enjoyed her job and knew this restaurant well. I ended up ordering the Cappellacci all'Aragosta, aka Lobster Ravioli. It was the best dinner dish we ordered and the sauce on the pasta was absolutely amazing. My dad ordered the Spaghetti Barese and enjoyed the sausage and meatballs. He said the sauce was perfect and complimented the meats well. My mom ordered the Gnocchi al Brivido. She stated that you could tell the gnocchi was fresh and homemade. My sister ordered the lasagna. It was a huge portion and she barely made a dent in it, despite how delicious she said it was. Throughout the meal, my mom and I enjoyed some wine and cocktails. They have a great selection and the servers are all knowledgable about what their bartenders can make and which wines are the best. We weren't planning on getting desert because we were all full and leaving with three boxes full of leftovers, but because of the special occasion, the restaurant had ordered and paid for two deserts. The bread pudding and tiramisu were both absolutely outstanding. I don't usually like bread pudding, but thought this dish was absolutely decadent. So I know this is a long review, but I think its important for me to add this as well. The busboys were my favorite part of this restaurant. They were constantly checking on all of the tables, refilling water glasses, bringing extra bread, clearing plates, and more. They were kind and wanted to make sure that every person in the restaurant had a good experience. Having worked in the food industry for many years, I have seen some horrible busboys. But not here.

2017-06-04,5.0,"If it's going to live up to the ""neighborhood gem"" title that many reviewers seem to be giving it, it has to be more than just tasty--it has to be accessible, and preferably friendly. And luckily, Sapori is all of those things. This is a quaint but lively restaurant, where recommendations are probably a good idea, but its deceivingly small size (upstairs seating, outdoor seating in the summer) makes it a viable option on a spontaneous night out, too.  In terms of consistency, Sapori is as good as Italian fare in Chicago gets. That much is clear from just the complimentary bread: always warm, perfectly crusty, and generously portioned. You won't find the most novel dishes of the neighborhood here, or the most creatively plated ones, but you can almost certainly count on a happy, full stomach and leftovers to spare. Don't let the price of the Zuppa di Pesce upset you--it will last you 2-3 meals, and its seafood content is like a small cross section of the ocean itself. And be sure to try one (or both!) of the calamari appetizers.  For those of you who are ramen aficionados, Sapori is the ""Kizuki"" of Chicago Italian spots: reliably delicious, but simple--maybe a little too much so for the price range.

We ordered: Grilled calamari - a little intimidating looking at first as the calamari is not cut up and it comes in a pool of dark sauce. Once you cut them up and put it in your mouth, it is full of flavor. Some pieces can be a bit chewy.  Bruschetta - traditional, clean tasting Bruschetta. Some things just have to be left simple and this place does it right.  Lobster ravioli - mighty delicious, the pasta is filled with generous amount of lobster filling and the cream sauce is amazing.  Meat lasagna - presentation is very unique. It is not your traditional tall piece, but flatter and looks almost like a pie or a slice of deep dish pizza. When you cut up a piece, it is the perfect bite, not too much pasta, not too much sauce.  Zuppa di pesce - we ordered it ""spicy"". My husband would not stop talking about this dish for days. It is huge, 2 people can easily share this.  Panna cotta - the most amazing dessert in the whole world.. I want to have this 3 times a day.

Talk about getting bang for your buck! Granted everything here is around 20 bucks or more so you get about 2 entrees for the deal. Calamari Fritti: Fried calamari served with red sauce. It was perfectly crispy and seasoned right. The portion was also huge, we couldn't even finish it. Cappellacci all'Aragosta: Lobster stuffed in handmade pasta, almost like a ravioli but a different shape and wayyyyy bigger. There were only about 5 or 6 pieces of pasta but it was huge!! I was stuffed after eating 3. I love how they pack the pasta with lobster so you're seriously getting your money's worth. Also, that pink sauce is heavenly! Super creamy yet light and flavorful. Lasagna Vegetariana: the BEST lasagna I've ever had the pleasure of tasting....the portion size is huge!!..enough to feed two people. My boyfriend got this and I couldn't stop taking some for myself. The layers of cheese, veggies, marinara, white sauce, and pasta was perfect! One bite and you get a flavor bomb. I love how veggie lasagna is subtle enough to taste all the flavors as opposed to meat sometimes overwhelming lasagna. We were so happy to have leftovers of this dish!

The shrimp was alright, but the pasta was dry and quickly soaked up what little sauce was at the bottom of the bowl. I passed the dish around so people could try it, just to make sure. My friend and I agreed, we could have made the same dish at home easily and just as tasteless. The only dish that had any flavor was the ground sausage in pasta shells, and that was overly salty.  Bland food aside, the waitress must have been having a night because she kept making scrunched up faces while we were ordering. Unceremoniously tossed cocktails down on the table and interrupted my toast TWICE. Yes you heard correctly, I was standing and giving a toast and she interrupts the entire table TWICE.

We came in during Restaurant Week and got 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, and 2 drinks Appetizers: Calamari Fritti - Very Tasty with just a tad too much salt. But really good. Burrata Pugliese - Some of the creamiest most delicious mozzarella cheese I've ever had. I didn't even know it could be this tender and creamy! So So good.  Entrees:  Cappellacci all'Aragosta - kind of similar to ravioli, but it's this creamy lobster filling wrapped in house-made pasta. The sauce made it very delicious and was surprisingly filling Spaghetti allo Scoglio - They added just the right amount of spice to it and the seafood was really good! I personally thought the sauce was a little lacking in flavor, but it was a huge portion and still good. Desserts: (At this point, we were incredibly full and couldn't fully appreciate the desserts) Tiramisu - SO GOOD! get it.  Panna Cotta - This one had a really interesting texture to it, but I liked it! Not as much as the tiramisu, but if you've never tried Panna Cotta, this one is a good one to try out. Since it was my birthday, they also served us 2 extra limoncelli drinks to try! They were really really really strong, and I really appreciated the great service our waiter had.

Seriously, I don't want you to ever set foot into another Italian restaurant unless it's Sappori Trattoria. I'm not asking, I'm telling you, if you want Italian, I normally would send you to Club Lago in Chicago but if you're not quite that far into the city, then this is your place!!!!!  After my husband took me for my Christmas gift to see Blue Man Group for the first time just down the street, we knew we were going to grab dinner in the area afterward and he wanted Italian so I pulled up my trusty Yelp app (insert advertising for Yelp's trusty app here) and found two places that caught my eye. This one was 3 minutes away and had like 1500+ reviews with 4.5 stars, I had to go with the majority on this. For that many reviews and to still have 4.5 stars with the world today being nothing but critics, I had to try this out for myself. We pulled a U-ey and off we went. Found a parking spot on the side street running adjacent to the building just a short walk down the street.  I actually called first to see if there was a wait and to my surprise on this Sunday evening, the gal told me there was no wait and to head on over. Her words, not mine. I loved it! She basically made me feel like I was being invited over which made the visit all that more exciting.  When we arrived I found the cozy entrance very well maintained with a heater in the corridor and my hubby and I waited patiently to be able to walk in behind the groups ahead of us. We asked for a table for 2 and the lovely hostess walked us upstairs to a second floor dining room. Tons more seating, a few restrooms and a nice view down Halstead. There was a sign at the entrance that said to please excuse their mess as they are remodeling but I thought the establishment looked great! Super cozy, clean, and it looked like a fresh coat of paint on the walls upstairs. It's amazing what a fresh coat of paint can do to a place. Really looked nice.  We were seated at a small table for two which I wasn't surprised being dinner time in the city. I figured we would feel crowded at our small table but it turned out to be perfect. It kept us intimate and really made it nice for conversation with each other and a sweet little date night with my favorite guy.  We were smart and although we totally wanted to app it up, we skipped and dove head first into our main dishes. My husband ordered their shrimp pasta and I, their lasagna. I hadn't had lasagna in a really long time and it just sounded good. When our server informed me it was an individually made lasagnas, I knew it would be perfect. Little did I know it was going to be enormous!!! I swear it was literally like 7"" x 7"" on a platter. Besides being huge, it was SOOOOOOOOOO DELICIOUS. I could not believe it! It was like I was eating Grandpa's lasagna all over again. My husband offered me a bite of his shrimp pasta and I decided to taste it. It wasn't my thing but then again, I'm not big on warm shrimp dishes. I prefer my shrimp cold but my husband absolutely loved it. We each had two additional meals worth of leftovers to take home and I tell ya what...my lasagna was even better on day number two and three.  We will be back soon, for sure!!!

The rigatoni bolognese had a lot of meat on it and great big pieces of rigatoni that I love, but the flavor of the sauce was on the bland side. The lobster ravioli was disappointing as well. To me, the sauce was lacking and the filling was more a lobster paste rather than fresh lobster. The zuppa de pesce is worth ordering again but only if you plan to share it - portions are huge and the spicy version is the way to go; it gives an otherwise bland sauce somewhat of a kick.

Entrees: - Lobster ravioli- Excellent and stuffed full with fresh lobster.  The sauce was so good, we were dipping our bread in the leftovers.   - Rigatoni bolognese- Topped with tons of ground meat and huge noodles.  Of the 3 pastas we got, this was the least unique and I'd skip it if you're choosing between the three, but it was a solid dish. - Zuppa di pesce- The house specialty filled with mussels, clams, scallops, shrimp, and salmon.  I'd definitely recommend getting this one ""spicy"" because it's mostly just spiced up with some red pepper flakes and without those, I think this would be pretty bland.  The sauce is more of a broth for the seafood to sit in and it soaks into the noodles.

The menu is quite extensive and we narrowed down to two dishes based on pictures posted on their Yelp album. (1) Milk & Honey Baby Back Ribs. $28.99 Baby back ribs marinated in honey and thyme finished in a slow braise of milk, porcini mushrooms and a touch of citrus. As highly anticipated by how delicious this sucker looked in the pictures, I am disappointed that the tastes were blander than expected. Didn't taste the honey, thyme or citrus, just lots of flavorless gravy covering a well braised cut of ribs. (2) Bucatini Carbonara. $21.99 Tube pasta tossed with pancetta, egg yolk, cream, onion, and smoked bacon with a touch of parsley and Grana Padano cheese. YES! I hardly have pasta, but who can deny a plate of creamy bacon rich pasta? The cheese and smoked bacon was quite rich and creamy.

I went in the fall, and they had a pumpkin martini that was to die for. If I wasn't supposed to run 26 miles the next day, I would have probably had 3-4 of them... stupid marathon. To carb load before my big day, I chose the gnocchi, which is one of my favorites. I knew I was going to love this dish as the plate came out. The presentation was amazing, and I could smell it from about a mile away. The dish was absolutely perfect, and despite the huge portion, I finished the whole thing.

What those people should do is take note of how you treat people, no matter what type of clientele you have in your restaurant. WITH THIS BEING SAID.... This place is where it's at, so they should take note. Let's start from the very beginning, I walked in for a surprise family dinner. It was my first time being there, and right away the person at the front welcomed us with a smile. Yeah, believe it or not that goes a long way. FIRST STAR.  I was then seated, and right away our waitress came over to greet us. She was awesome. Super nice, with a nice smile. I believe her name was Katie. Beyond welcoming. Asked us if we've ever been, and what we wanted to drink. She gave recommendations, and brought us what we needed right away. She was very attentive, and at no point did it feel as if we were bothering her with what we needed. SECOND STAR.  The other nice thing about this place is it's so cozy! Cute in the inside. Nice lights around the place. Also! One super cool thing was all the menus were custom with my name on them for my birthday! THIRD STAR.  Now the food.... mmmm. Fresh bread! (Which we had like 4 baskets of) Great appetizers! I definitely recommend the Bruschetta, amazing. And our main dishes were fantastic. We all made sure to take what we didn't finish, lol. I would love to go back to have the shrimp. They were huge! Mmm. FOURTH STAR.  LASTLY! The place brought out my cake, and it was just beautiful. They sang Happy Birthday with us, and were overall just so helpful with it all. They even brought us champagne. I could never have had a better experience for a birthday dinner.

They did come by a couple of times to say our order would be out ""soon"" as it was taking quite a bit if time ( and they were not crowded) .

Had both of the calamari apps and preferred the fritta over the grilled here.  I just can't seem to find a comparable grilled calamari to the old Trattoria Roma on Wells St in Old Town.  I had the risotto pescatore and it was excellent. The rice was done correctly and none of the seafood was overcooked. This is a talented chef. My son had the Osso bucco and loved it. My wife ordered the baby back ribs that were served over a bed of very finely shredded sweet potato strands that tasted amazing with the rib meat. The family patriarch enjoyed a hefty plate of sea bass and proceeded to be the sole taker on dessert, trying the bread pudding with raspberry sauce. A forkfull was had, enjoyed, and tried again. Always a great night a Sappori Trattoria.  Our server, Carol, was very nice. She seemed genuinely happy to be there and never had us waiting or wanting for anything. One thing I like about Sappori is that it is well run and well staffed.  You do pay a bit more, but the portions are large, the service is very good, and the quality is high.  Free valet parking during the week too!",0.9885,0.812,0.183,0.005,0.5595604395604395

The chicken was so moist and the saucy gravy stuff it came with was great for sopping up with the house bread. That bread is also amazing!! Mom liked it so much, our loving server packed some fresh bread for her to take home. The featured pino grigio was also super smooth and went real well with the seafood pasta. At the end of our meal,  we were graciously gifted a tiramisu on the house!! What?!? We were oh so stuffed at the end of dinner, but still devoured dessert.

I was so impressed by the service and the food, I will definitely be back. I ordered the Cappellacci di Zucca, which is a classic pumpkin, sage and pine nut pasta in a brown butter sauce. I've had it at other restaurants, but this had the addition of being topped with fried pumpkin/squash pieces which added a lovely texture. My date ordered the Cappellacci all'Aragosta, which is lobster pasta in a creamy sauce. I tried a few bites, which was more than enough as it has incredibly rich and luxuriously creamy. For dessert, the Tiramisu (because what else do you get when you get Italian?) which I thoroughly enjoyed. Often it can be too sweet and sometimes too dry, but this wasn't soggy - perfectly wet, slightly liquored and a great balance of flavor. What really, really impressed me about this restaurant was the service. I couldn't finish my pasta and asked to box it up - the bus boy accidentally threw it away before we left. Normally I wouldn't mind, but they insisted they make us a brand new dish to take with, and gave us some complimentary dessert wine while we waited. They were incredibly apologetic for something that really isn't a big deal.  That alone will bring me back.

The wait staff and chef are so extremely friendly; at the end of our dinner, the owner of the restaurant came and talked to us about our meal and we had a great conversation (not just a quick ""how was the meal""). They also have not only sent a coupon for our birthday, but even our half-birthdays with a note on the envelope. It's always a pleasant surprise in the mail!  We went there on a weekday; the venue itself looks like a little hidden gem in Lincoln Park. Once you walk inside, its quite large. It's dim and quite romantic - perfect for a date night. The food itself was quite enjoyable and tasted freshly made. We went on a Tuesday evening, where the items were more ""tapas"" sized and they had live jazz music!

Melissa was very attentive throughout the meal. Italian bread was exactly how it should be served, warm with a hard crust and soft middle. Grilled calamari is an appetizer that you need to try. Calamari was grilled and served in a creamy balsamic sauce with roasted red peppers. The calamari was tender and delicious. I ordered the Chilean sea bass, which was pan seared and served on top of sauted spinach. The fish was tender and fresh. I tried my boyfriend's lamp chop cooked medium rare. They serve a full rack and believe me that you will devour the entire plate! We tried the bread pudding, chocolate hazelnut panna cotta, chocolate raspberry cake and tiramisu.  All were great, but the two that are worthy of a repeat are the bread pudding and panna cotta. The only negative was that coffee came after we had consumed desert, but they apologized and gave it to us on the house. Next time I am in Chicago this is a must return.

2016-04-18,5.0,Really delicious - a new favorite Italian place in the city. I live downtown and usually only go to restaurants within walking distance but I was feeling adventurous and decided it was worth the Uber fare to take us up to Sapori based on the strong Yelp reviews. The dining rooms are nice: there are multiple floors in what feels like someone's house - it is a nice ambiance for a family outing or a date. Our server was very friendly and helpful recommending dishes - the menu has so many tasty options so we relied on his expertise to narrow it down to the lasagna and pumpkin stuffed shells. Both were awesome with the pumpkin stuffed shells being a must try - really unique and delicious - I've never had anything like it. Also worth mentioning is the delicious warm bread they bring out at the beginning. The prices may seem a bit steep at first but I would argue that the portion sizes are 50-100% larger than other Italian places in the city which should be factored in to your analysis of the price. Keep in mind that the photos I'm posting with this review are half portions as they split the dishes between the two of us.

I get that she was really busy, but she kept going around to all of the other tables to ensure they were doing ok, and didn't really give much attention to my friend and I. Demographic thing maybe? All the other tables were filled with older, white couples and my friend and I were young female asians. For someone who wants tips, I can understand why they would cater to the other tables more, but we could have tipped just as well. Service is key for me, and not receiving something that is up to my standards will easily cut your tip in half.  3) I got their lobster ravioli which was a special that night, I believe. It was really good but looked like someone had thrown up all over the plate. They need to work on their plating. If I was a pickier eater, I probably wouldn't have touched it.

2016-02-17,5.0,"So this is my first time coming here and I was told about this place from my sister who seems to be a regular here haha. Seeing from my rating I had a great experience and also the fact that the hostess is a old friend! Her name is Grace and she is awesome! The vibe when walking into the restaurant had a calm and relaxing atmosphere. There seems to be local art and photos on the walls and really makes it a wonderful place to enjoy a good meal. Well let's get on with the food. We started off with a salad dish the Insalata Stella. It was well dressed, not too much and not too little. I enjoyed the cheese cut in cubes and also the pine nuts that were also in there. The apple was a plus, made it juicy rather than the normal sourness from the vinaigrette.  Next we got the Calamari Fritti. When you take a bite the calamari was soft and easy to chew. The marinara that comes with it is great too! It also comes with two lemon slices.  For our meal we had the Pennette Cardinale and it was so good! I loved the creaminess, but at the same time it wasn't too heavy. I normally love alfredo and so this was a good mixture of the sauce. Not sure if it was actually a mixture of the two, but it was a light orange color. The artichoke in there was great and complimented it well with the roasted tomatoes. Also it has chicken.  Lastly for our dessert we had tiramisu, honestly I feel like I had better. Was kind of hard to taste the rum and really get the full flavor. And got the free cappuccino from yelp, which tasted rich!

2016-02-16,5.0,"What a night. Sapori Trattori is a hidden gem in the Lincoln Park area located across from local hot spot ""Alive One"" - which is an upscale club and THE place to be seen on Friday night. We walked into Sapori and were immediately taken to the very back of the restaurant [As requested on my Open Table reservation]. As we walked past dining patrons we noticed a small cozy room that reminded me of a 19th century a study. Very hip, very Wicker. For drinks it was a mix of white and red wines. Neither one of us was trying to get bombed but not drinking wine with Italian food is bad karma. We lead off with a grilled calimari dish for an app. Yes, I said grilled. You cant get that anywhere else in Chicago according to our waiter.  I ordered a cesar salad that was ultra peppery, but hit the spot. For a main course I got a lobster ravioli that was so good it made me want to slap my mamma. The lady ordered a spaghetti & meatball dish that reminded her of Sicily.  As dinner concluded we were shocked to receive a $20/Coupon from Chef Anthony himself!!! He went out of his way to send it to ""lucky"" diners. You have to use the coupon on certain days, there are severe restrictions on how it can be used, but still it was a nice gesture by Chef Anthony. He was not in the house but I hope to meet him soon.

Our waitress, Melissa, was knowledgeable, helpful and the perfect amount of attentive. We got a bottle of tempranillo from spain. It was an affordable 40 dollars and did not disappoint, a surprisingly sweet taste, somewhat fruity, with that nice dry spicey tempranillo finish. We both loved it.  She got a mouth watering lobster ravioli which made my dish jealous even though I had ordered the most delicious veal shank I've ever eaten atop a meat lasagna.  For dessert, the raspberry chocolate cake with some espresso. Ah-mazing. Couldn't be happier with this place.

My Yelp research showed that this was a ""two dollar sign"" restaurant and ""casual.""  It is... Barely. I would recommend at least a collar for guys if you're dining here. I showed up in a t-shirt and felt underdressed. Our server was polite, but not overly so. I was unsure if she was unhappy about serving a pair of 22-year-olds who were not dressed sufficiently well, or if something else was going on, but I didn't feel as welcomed as I would have liked. The service was, however, excellent and prompt overall. This restaurant is two stories, in what appears to have been a house at one point. Their wine list was great- some options across the price spectrum. The food selection was ample, although this place skews more heavily towards seafood (lobster ravioli is their ""thing""). I had a seafood mixed risotto and it was outstanding. Desserts were also fantastic- an excellent tiramisu, and my dining partner had a lovely chocolate peanut butter dish.  Excellent food, nice ambiance, especially for a date.

The marinara was flavorful and garlicky with just the right amount of seafood taste without being too fishy. The shrimp, scallops, mussels and clams were all well cooked and there was more than enough food to take home as leftovers at the end of the meal.

Got seated right away with a reservation , ambiance was cute, waiter was fantastic. Now onto the good stuff - the food: Wine: Waiter recommended the Montepulciano D'Abruzzo- it went great with our meals! Appetizer: Crostini d'Avocado- Mouthwateringly good. Working to recreate this at home. The avocados were extremely fresh and the flavors went together perfectly, was very happy our waiter recommended this instead of the bruschetta (although that's probably great too). Came with two pieces.  Caesar Salad- Good. I'd get it again but the least stand out item from the menu. Good size.  Main Course: Veggie Lasagna- I actually had a dream about this last night it was that good. I was debating between the veggie and the meat and again, our waiter led me to the holy land of amazing food by recommending the veggie. The sauce was incredible the vegetables complemented each other perfectly, and there may have been some secret drug in there too since I'm so addicted (just kidding... But seriously. It's amazing). It was by far the largest piece of lasagna I've ever had. In general, the portions here were very large which you typically don't see at nicer Italian restaurants.  Gnocchi- Boyfriend had the gnocchi and the pesto was amazing and not overbearing, and the sun dried tomatoes were perfect. Also a very healthy portion. Dessert- We got our prosecco with dessert and then he got  a Tiramisu since I don't love sweets. That being said, when he tried it he said I had to try it because was delicious.

2016-01-23,5.0,"SO GOOD! I can't rave enough. I know there are thousands of reviews like this one, but I had to add to the great feedback based on how the evening COULD have gone if not for their great staff. We made a reservation through Yelp for 7:30 on a Friday and arrived at the restaurant to tons of people standing around waiting. I would say around 10-15 people when we arrived. Their reservation system for Yelp, OpenTable, etc. was down, so like half of the people arriving for dinner ""with reservations"" didn't actually have reservations with the restaurant. The hostesses were kind, accommodating, calm and handled their shit like total bosses. The hostess, who was maybe 19 or so, calmly took our names and let us know it would be a little bit of a wait. I was expecting her to say like 30 minutes or an hour (which is not unheard of and would've been tolerable) but then she says 10 to 15 minutes. I'm just like oh my goodness that's not even a wait compared to most restaurants. We waited probably less than the quoted time and enjoyed a WONDERFUL evening. The team continued their impeccable service as we watched them handle the stream of patrons with no fuss or issue. You could tell they were a little stressed and are typically highly organized with their reservations and seatings, but only when they thought the patrons weren't looking :) They efficiently sat all the groups waiting, coming in, etc. throughout our dinner. We never saw any other groups wait too long or have any issues, all thanks to their team's calm, cool, collected outlook and ability to run their operation efficiently. Our waitress was an absolute doll, the busser was SUPER efficient and kept my water full after almost every sip, and of course, the food was DELICIOUS. I had the lobster ""ravioli"" everyone raves about on on here and it totally earned all those kudos. The raviolis are obviously house-made pasta cut and hand stuffed. Impeccable. And huge HUGE portions. My dish was $22 and I probably could've made 3 meals out of it. But, it was delicious so I just have leftovers for 1 meal. Cesar salad was on point too. Oh, and they had a good cheap 6.50 house cab that was not bad at all. A total plus in my book!",0.9988,0.716,0.251,0.034,0.65050135501355

It was full of flavor and delicious. I had the lasagna as my main dish. The pasta was hand-made, the sauce was perfect. My only complaint was that the cheese seemed a bit excessive on the top, but I just pulled some of it off and it was perfect. I saw many recommendations for the tiramisu and they were right, it was better than any I've tried. The chef's drink was blood orange soda, lemon juice and I'm unsure of the remaining ingredients, but it was very good too!

2016-01-16,5.0,"Made a reservation here for a Sunday evening and the place was still very full. I really liked the ambiance. They basically converted the first 2 floors of a house for the restaurant and left all the cute niches and exposed brick walls with a nice combination of soft lit chandeliers and spot lighting (you can actually see the menus with the light placing despite the low lighting). Our server that night, Patrick, was really awesome and made the experience over the moon. He was incredibly helpful and friendly throughout the evening (I loved that he made it super easy to figure out the vegetarian options on the menu :) ). We started off with a glass of wine each, the merlot was really delicious and I ended up with a nice crisp white with a hint of guava myself (I started with a white that didn't suit and Patrick was great about getting me a fresh glass of something I'd enjoy). We ordered the asparagus salad - lightly dressed with balsamic vinaigrette and huge pieces of goat cheese over a bed of greens and it had some kind of nut. I would've liked a bit more lemon/acid, but we really like goat cheese! We ordered a creamy penne pasta dish for the 2 of us, and had it modified to leave out the chicken and have the hand made pasta ( doesn't come with that normally). It had a lot of fresh basil and extra veggies, we pretty much wiped the plates clean!Finally, we finished off the night with a large piece of tiramisu - great balance of the flavors, and really light fluffy mascarpone.

2016-01-04,5.0,"One of my best buds had a Groupon for Sapori Trattoria so we decided to get a couple other guys and get a nice dinner on an otherwise boring Sunday evening. We trekked up to Lincoln Park and were able to find parking nearby. Sapori doesn't have any big flashy signs or anything, if you don't notice the awning, it's quite easy to overlook, but if you overlook Sapori, you'll surely be missing out on an awesome place! We had a reservation and were not surprised to find plenty of open tables around 8pm on a Sunday. This was nice because we were able to enjoy a fairly quiet, attentive dinner. The inside of the restaurant is fairly small, but very chic. Works (with accompanying price tags) from local artists and photographers adorned the walls. Sapori is dimly lit, with classic paper table coverings, and seating so close you're liable to make a new friend or two on a busy night. Furthermore, Sapori is probably not the place to spontaneously bring the loud, 20 person family for Uncle Guido's 55th birthday. It is the place, however, to bring your dashing significant other for an intimate date night. I would imagine that it gets quite crowded on any given Friday or Saturday, and a reservation would almost be necessary at such a time. We started with a couple of appetizers. First was the fried calamari, and second was the burrata. The calamari was good, nicely breaded with a great red sauce to go with it. The burrata was amazing. The flavors and texture of the crunchy bread, creamy fresh mozzarella cheese, thick cut prosciutto and tomato were absolutely fantastic. We did get a couple of drinks too. I opted for the Giancarlo Chianti which wasn't bad, but perhaps a little underwhelming at $8/glass. Decent sized pour, though. Another friend went with the servers recommendation of a French martini. I mooched a sip and holy cow, this was one quality cocktail! It was quite strong but so expertly mixed that the fruity flavors overshadowed the alcohol taste. We were warned about Sapori's traditional-sized portions and even after we ate our share of appetizers and bread (with oil of noteworthy quality), we still opted for one entrée each. Everyone thought their dishes were delicious. One friend had the buccatini carbonara, one the pennette cardinale, the other the cappellacci all' aragosta, and myself the gnocchi al brivido. We all insisted on trying each others' food and there wasn't any dishes the four of us disliked. I can especially comment on the cappellacci aragosta, which was most similar to a lobster ravioli. This was out of this world and probably would be my go-to item here. The pasta was done right and the lobster was so fresh and flavorful it literally melted in your mouth. The sauce was both creamy and a little acidic. I also speculate that some type of seafood stock was part of the recipe. It had a subtle fishy taste to it, but the good kind of fishy that complements the whole dish. My gnocchi was also quite tasty. I'd consider myself a pesto freak, and while this pesto was more of an oil-based sauce and not a cream sauce, it was exceptionally flavorful and matched perfectly with the thick gnocchi, yummy dried tomatoes, and hearty chicken chunks. The unanimous decision was that the cappellacci was the best of all the plates, though. Peter was our server and he was very good and quite knowledgeable. He was calm, cool and collective but definitely made some quality recommendations, helped us with pronouncing menu items, as well as threw in some grin-worthy comments here and there. Service was spot-on. I would really be nit-picking the finest of details if I were to report anything negative about our experience here. While Sapori is a little pricey, the quality of food here (made-in-house noodles and sauces, for example), the location, and the experience is definitely worth it. Not to mention, we had a considerable discount due to the Groupon we used.  Overall I really enjoyed our experience at Sapori Trattoria. I would summarize it as being more of an intimate, authentic and boutique Italian restaurant. Take advantage of the deals they offer on Yelp and Groupon and your experience is sure to be as good as ours was. Excellent!",0.9991,0.782,0.185,0.033,0.5572062344221437

They still serve food in American order unless you specify and the cappuccino was also not traditional (massive American sized coffee).

I was skeptical as I had a Living Social deal and have seen this place listed a few times for deals, maybe suggesting that there was a reason for such deals as with some other places I've tried that turned out to be mediocre...but not Sapori Trattoria! Had reservations Sunday evening at 6:30 pm. We were seated promptly but this place was still pretty busy. The space was a lot larger than it appears with various seating areas that extend to the back which was where we were seated. Right away, there was a lot of rustic charm in its ambience. Boo and I got the grilled calamari to start. Get this! This was so delish. Perfectly cooked, beautiful presentation and awesome unique flavor. I got the lobster stuffed pasta as the bf got the meat lasagna. Our server was very nice and helpful and explained to us that their pastas and sauces are all homemade. Both were sooo good. Nothing was too salty, all the flavors meshed well together and were robust. Super tasty. Even the complimentary bread was good...it was perfectly toasted on the outside and chewy on the inside. The olive oil even tasted of higher quality. Already stuffed at this point, I finished with the lemon sorbetto. Such beautiful presentation as the sorbet filled a huge frozen lemon sitting in a martini glass. The sorbet was perfectly sweet and tart with a slight creaminess to it. Boo enjoyed his bread pudding. Overall, definitely coming back for my next Italian cravings. Better food, prices and service than most other Italian places especially in LP.",0.9985,0.727,0.268,0.005,0.5205980066445182
2015-12-29,5.0,"This review has been sitting in my drafts for months now because I actually wanted to go back one more time before completing it, but yesterday I received a handwritten note from Chef Anthony along with a gift certificate in the mail. I was originally between 4 and 5 stars, but I thought this was such a kind gesture that I had to bump them up to 5. They also take reservations (you can do this through Yelp), which is a huge plus.  I came here quite a while ago, but from what I remember, the food was great, the service was incredible, and the atmosphere was very cute. It started off a bit loud, but became more intimate as it got later. I imagined the portions would be small for some reason--they were not. At all.  As a testament to how good the food is, my roommate ate my leftovers more than a week later and was still impressed. She also somehow did not get sick...  They really make an effort to personalize your experience. For example, the gift certificate and note they sent me included my name and everything. After reading other people's reviews, it seems this is fairly commonplace and it's actually font, not handwriting (I'll have to go home and verify because I almost don't believe it), but for a restaurant that gets a good amount of traffic, I feel like this is really unique.

2015-11-21,4.0,Tried this place for the first time last night for a friend's birthday. It was a group of about 25 people. The service was phenomenal. We had two servers I only remembered one of their names which was Heather. The bruschetta with the avocado was awesome and also the calamari was one of the best I've had. I ordered the gnocchi something which was the reason I gave 4/5 because it was not very flavorful.,0.8519,0.891,0.109,0.0,0.49999999999999994

You can also purchase a voucher off yelp for $11 to get $20 off of your meal (not valid on Fridays and Saturdays)  The best Italian I've ever had. I feel like that's all the recommendation this place really needs, but for those of you who need more than that, here's some more info: I always ask for the waiter's recommendation whenever I try a new restaurant, and was recommended either the lasagna or the lobster pasta. He claimed the lasagna was worth making a trip for, and I'm glad to say he was right. My friend got the lasagna since I'm not really a big lasagna fan, and we both agreed it was probably the best lasagna either of us have ever tried. I got the lobster pasta, which came in a delicious cream sauce. It was good enough that my friend kept sneaking little tastes of sauce off my plate the entire meal. My other friend got the seafood pasta, which he asked to be made spicy. It wasn't actually spicy, but still very well executed. The grilled calamari was good enough that my friend wanted to order a second one after finishing the first one. Good thing we stopped him because the portion sizes were generous for our entrees and we probably wouldn't have finished it. I normally never choose tiramisu, but we decided to split one between the three of us for dessert. Given how delicious the rest of the meal was, we didn't want to pass up on dessert even though we were full. This was a good one. It's very rare to find a restaurant that's capable of killing it in on appetizers, entrees, and dessert. 5 well deserved stars for this restaurant for delivering such consistently good food. On top of this, this place is a good value for your money.

And like a true Italian family gathering, they were happy to see us finally get there, ""moved over and made room"" at the table.  So we loved them right there and then.

Great flavor, cool and not too sweet. Just like my favorite man, but I digress. My favorite man was unimpressed with the bourbon options, but Italian beer was a good plan B.

I think the stuffing could have been more distinguished. Dinner plates were wonderful, huge ,cheesy and flavorful. Plan on leftovers, unless you are hanging wiht big eaters, as I was.

The richness of the sauce balanced perfectly with the saltiness of the meat and cheese.   My wife ordered the Gamberoni e Broccoli (jumbo shrimp with linguini in a white wine garlic sauce with roasted tomatoes, fresh veggies, and roasted broccoli) and it was also top notch.  The sauce was flavorful but did not overpower the fresh shrimp and vegetables.  Again, the perfect balance was achieved.   We will most definitely be back!",0.9822,0.772,0.187,0.042,0.5295454545454545

2015-10-14,4.0,"Okay so no wonder this is rated one of the best and most reviewed Italian restaurant in Chicago, it definitely has its merit and we definitely enjoyed a nice Saturday evening with another couple here as well. The atmosphere is very nice and they have two floors and can accommodate you on a date night or if you come here with a large party for a big birthday bash. There were four of us there and we got a nice quaint table upstairs by a window and I almost felt like I was in a little Italian village enjoying some comfort Italian food.  Now onto the important stuff, the Italian goods. We decided to share the fried calamari and it was tasty but a little on the harder side so I would have preferred it to be softer but honestly, most calamari is pretty edible, it's fried after all. After seeing all the reviews, I know that the lobster ravioli was a must item to order here so that is one of the three pasta dishes that we ended up sharing. It was seriously divine, I wanted to lick the entire plate of that yummy orange sauce. I mean they didn't skimp out on their lobster and I would absolutely come back here just for this lobster ravioli as it's the best one I may have ever had anywhere. Then we ordered the gamberoni e broccoli dish which is a a seafood linguini essentially with two giant shrimp and tons of fresh veggies in this yummy and simple sauce. The pasta may have been my favorite of the night as I could not stop getting it so if you want one unique dish here, I would absolutely get that. We also tried the gnocchi with the basil pine nut pesto sauce and it was a little too green for me like not sure if they over did it with the pesto or basil, but it almost lacked actual pasta flavor as the flavors were a little over done for me so I would not order this particular dish in the future. So I had to save room for my capuccino (pretending I was in Florence) and the hazelnut pana cotta with chocolate sauce. The dessert was definitely tasty but not the best thing I've ever had as I'm not the biggest fan of the jello like texture of panna cotta as I'm more of a creme brulee kind of girl if you know what I mean.  Overall, we had a fantastic night and I will definitely be back. Our server was nice, kind of rushed us in the beginning but overall turned out to be nice. The pasta dishes were some of the best I've had, it's not a pretentious place, you don't have the trendy element like in RPM Italian but it's just some good old comfort food Italian and I will absolutely be back for this gem.",0.9988,0.756,0.228,0.016,0.49999349466562576

2015-10-10,5.0,"After many years of walking past this restaurant I FINALLY decided to try it out. First I must say that the outside appearance is deceiving, I always thought it was probably small inside but I quickly learned I was wrong. There are two floors! (I would've never guessed.) I made dinner reservations for my Mother's birthday on a Friday night. I should also add that I was able to make them straight from my Yelp app which was super easy and convenient!  Once we arrived a young lady working alongside the host cheerfully led us to our table on the second level.  There isn't an elevator which leaves quite a few stairs to walk up, if stairs are a problem I would definitely call in and try to get a table on the first floor. After we sat down to look over the menu we noticed that they all had a lovely birthday greeting with my Mothers name at the very top. ( Great touch Sapori Trattoria!) I could tell this was one of the highlights of her day. On to the food, they do bring out the traditional bread, oil, and parmesan cheese for you to snack on before your meal. My table ordered the lobster ravioli, lamb chops, salad, bruschetta, and spaghetti. Everything was delicious and well portioned. Our server was very kind and patient, he let my Mother sample a few different wines to find one she really enjoyed.  After we were done and our plates were cleared away the server put down four new plates and then surprised us with birthday dessert on the house.

We ordered a beer, a bottle of sparkling water, and a latte. The latte was good: very creamy. The complimentary bread was very standard. To start, we got the burrata and the fried calamari. The burrata was pretty good: decent cheese and prosciutto, and some good sundried tomatos. The fried calamari were reasonably well-done, but were served with an utterly uninspired and bland tomato sauce. We then got the Spaghetti Barese to share: the meatballs and sausage were fine, but it was again smothered in a rather boring tomato sauce. Then we got our personal dishes: my friends got the lasagna and the duck leg -- the latter apparently was very good. I had the Cappellacci all'Aragosta (Lobster Ravioli), after reading some very positive reviews. I immediately realized that this dish was basically Bisque with the lobster wrapped up in ravioli. Beyond that, I found the flavor of the dough to be overpowering: it was hard to actually taste the lobster. Generally, the dish was simply creamy-sweet, and didn't taste like much beyond that. We never got our sparkling water. The waitress apologized and brought us a complimentary serving of Tiramisu, which had a hint of citrus to it.

2015-09-23,5.0,"I've had the pleasure of eating at Sapori Trattoria on a few different occasions and I can honestly say that it's my favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago. To start, the atmosphere is outstanding. It has a great home-like feel that you would come to expect from a traditional Italian restaurant. The service is great and Chef Anthony is very attentive, but the food is the real reason this place is the best in the city.  If you're a salad fan, consider the Insalata Stella, which features greens, endive, apples, and pine nuts with a raspberry vinaigrette. The sweetness of the dressing and the apples goes perfectly with the bitter taste of the endive and the earthiness of the pine nuts. If you're looking for a salad that has a bit more richness, go for the Insalata Brustica: crispy raw brussel sprouts, pancetta, dried cranberries, and an incredible avocado buttermilk dressing Moving to the main courses, the homemade pasta here is fantastic. The sauce in the Pennette Cardinale, a white wine tomato cream sauce, has a lot of depth and richness. The acidity of the artichokes and cherry tomatoes help balance the dish and bring it all together. The Pollo Ternana (chicken breast is stuffed with smoked provolone, basil, mushrooms, asparagus, sun dried tomatoes and pine nuts) is one of my favorite chicken dishes, period.  For red meat, look no further than the Vitello Ossobuco, which consists of veal shank that falls right off the bone and is topped with a bold red sauce. In case that isn't enough, it's served over a piece of delicious meat lasagna. Don't forget to spoon out some of the tasty bone marrow from the shank, it gives it the fatty, rich flare that puts this dish over the top. If you aren't a veal fan, go for the lamb chops. Simply put, they're perfect. At the end of your meal don't hesitate to write your feedback on the cards your server gives you, Chef Anthony reads and responds to every note and sometimes even sends a gift certificate your way. The attention to detail at Sapori sets it apart. In a city with some great Italian restaurants, this place ranks #1.",0.9978,0.756,0.215,0.029,0.57448489010989

2015-09-07,1.0,"Either reviews here are fake or people have lost their mind/taste... My girlfriend and I went to this place for dinner. Nearly every possible aspect of our experience was bad. I'll describe them succinctly:  * Our table was reserved for 7:30. We were not seated before 7:55, with no initiated explanation given for the delay * After being seated, not one server so much as looked our way, let alone provided us water/bread, etc.  * The bread we were given was on the stale side. The Parmesan seemed to be spoiled.  * Our order comprised of: Cesare salad, Cappellacci di Zucca and Gnocchi al Brivido. The salad arrived quite quickly. But... We waited ONE HOUR AND TEN MINUTES for our entrees.  * The Cesare's dressing was too salty; the croutons were bland and stale. Screwing up a Cesare truly takes talent...  * The di Zucca was way too oily and greasy.  * The Gnocchi's pesto sauce was bitter, too salty and just.. wrong.  * Little requests - beer fill-up, another drink, clearing up used dishes, water, etc. were very slowly addressed.  * People were allowed to stand by the bar, drink and be loud while waiting for a table, even though they were just 5 inches away from our table. As a result it was loud, stuffy and unpleasant.  For the sake of complete disclosure I will say that midway through dinner we angrily told the staff we wanted to cancel and leave. In response, the restaurant manger apologized, explained the reasons for the shortcomings (""unexpectedly understaffed"". Doesn't excuse it all in my mind...) and offered to cover the entire meal.  I strongly recommend not eating here.a",-0.9624,0.848,0.034,0.117,0.6251449275362319

Tasted like plain meat without any flavor and ended up pushing it to the side. Tried some of my friend's Zuppa di Pesce, which I have to admit was quite tasty, even as someone who doesn't normally enjoy seafood. Ended off the evening with some Panna Cotta (chocolate hazelnut cream) which was divine.

I tend to avoid Italian cuisine because I don't have an affinity for pasta or pizza. But given some raving reviews, I got curious to try. They had good seafood options and the dishes are well portioned that they can be shared.  We ordered mussels in white sauce as a starter. These are rather jumbo sized mussels. I opted for the fresh bread from the bread basket to pick up the broth than the garlic toasts that it came with. Unfortunately, we were already getting full from the fresh ""crack"" bread basket since it took a while for our main entrees to arrive.  I am so so so so very appreciative of our waitress who suggested to get the half order of the Zuppa di Pesce (A Sapori classic) for 2 people. She was open and asked how much leftovers we wanted. We ordered this spicy and it came in a fairly large bowl brimming with a variety of fresh seafood. (I can't wait to eat these leftovers!). We also ordered the Pasta Contadino which was good contrast to the seafood dish. I do like orecchiette...(ok I know, as a pasta hater I do have a few preferences in shape.)   Overall, shame on me for being skeptical to try this place before!

It also has a very casual, neighborhood feel to it which I really appreciated. Our waiter, Rich, did an excellent job of taking care of us throughout the meal and making small talk. The rest of the waitstaff was on point as well. Started with a glass of wine and enjoyed the fresh bread and olive oil brought to the table. I ordered the Pasta Contadino while my gf got the Rigatoni Caprese. The Contadino had a really nice spicy kick to it (but not overbearing) and the sausage/pasta combo was very tasty. The rigatoni was also really good and the red sauce it came with tasted very fresh. The entrees aren't cheap but you get a very generous serving size and the quality is there as well.

The restaurant was much larger than I expected when looking from the outside, so I was impressed by the space. No complaints about the room we had. The thing that let me down was the food. Based on the reviews from Yelp, I was looking for something more special than most Italian restaurants.  The first course was bruschetta which wasn't bad. It tasted fresh and the bread was not too hard. We had plenty, but for some reason the waiters took away all the food after 15 minutes. We had more than 3/4 of the food left on the plate!!!! Serious that was the first bad sign.  The main course was penna with a tomato sauce and a chicken with mushroom dish. The penna seriously was underwhelming. There was pasta, cheese, and sauce. No herbs noted or really much seasoning. It tasted like any cafeteria pasta honestly. The chicken was pretty good with stuffed basil, but again the seasoning was underwhelming. The dessert course was actually really good. We got tiramisu and it was delicious. But they gave so little compared to the portions for the other courses. The amount of food we got over all was pretty annoying. Again, this was a private event with a large group, so take this into consideration. But that's part of a restaurant.

The place was half full when we arrived in a Tuesday evening.  We could get a table near window, which was more cheerful than ones at a dark back room in an early summer evening.  The service was excellent overall.  Our server was attentive and prompt (4.5).  The food was good (3.5), but I was not impressed.  First, we were served bread, which was very tough (and probably a leftover from a day before; -1).  This was the first time I was served a day-old bread at a dinner in a decent Chicago restaurant.  Appetizers.  Calamari: Yum. Brussels sprout salad: interesting, but I would not order it again as the taste and texture were flat. We shared a lobster ravioli. Very tender pasta and a sauce flavored with Lobster shell (?) was pretty good, but again a bit flat.  The portion is generous and good enough for us to share.  We did not try wine here, but the price was a bit overpriced (x3.5 of the retail).

However, once I discovered it I was pleasantly impressed. The portion sizes were huge so lots of leftovers the next day which was appreciated and I also found the food fresh and delicious, they clearly use high quality ingredients.  Our waiter was pretty good, but the 4 star rating is because we literally couldn't find him once the me was over and had to go up to the hostess to find him so we could pay and leave. Turns out he was just smoking, which I get happens but could he have cashed us out first? We were the only table in our section so wouldn't have taken too long.

You know how sometimes you'll overeat low quality food and have that guilty/marginally unhappy sense of fullness? Here I can overeat and actually feel pretty good. It's a happy full, and that friends, is a rare find.  The caesar was good, but not as spectacular as other reviewers made it out. Only order it if you HAVE to have one.

2015-05-31,2.0,"I'm confused about how this place gets such high ratings on Yelp. My SO and I had a reservation on Saturday, May 30.  We showed up for the reservation 15 minutes early, and there was absolutely no waiting area.  About 15 people were all crammed into a tiny space in front of the Maitre D' podium, and in the entry way.  People were pushing and shoving for standing space. When a spot opened up at the bar to wait, we went to the bar- no stools.  And, there was only standing room for about six people at their bar.  The bartender looked over at me several times over the course of 5 minutes before asking if we needed help. Our table was upstairs, in the back area.  The entire restaurant was packed with tables.  I did not think there should be so many tables.  The place was crammed and noisy.  Servers and bussers were weaving in and out of tables even.  And, the room was drafty. The amount of people here, and the high amount of noise, induced an anxiety attack. Our server only served us our drinks.  Other than that, the bus staff brought our food.  They also never knew which table got which dishes.  They would come out with a plate, walk around the room, then the server would point out which table got said plate.  We received our bread mere minutes before our main course, and after our appetizer.  They brought out the wrong dessert. Had to remind the server of the bread, and of my order of coffee. I hoped the food would make up for it, but the food was nothing spectacular.  If anything, it was grossly over priced.  I've had better Italian food in Ames, Iowa.",-0.4201,0.926,0.025,0.048,0.5053968253968254

While they kicked in a free dessert for the table to make up for the wait, this lack of front house management is my reason for a reduction of stars. The pasta portions are huge! For $20-$25, you get a tureen of pasta! I recommend splitting a pasta along with a salad or appetizer for the perfect filling meal with no leftovers.  They wine menu is extensive with high and affordable wines, and my table split a lovely cab sauv for under $35. My gnocchi with squid ink was flavorful, and the gnocchi and squid were cooked so perfectly that the whole dish melted in your mouth. However, I thought the standout dish was my friends vegetable lasagna. Cheesy, with big sheets of fresh pasta, studded with mushrooms and zucchini and covered in a fresh tomato sauce. The portion was the size of my face, so split or anticipate leftovers. I also had the salad rustica with brussel sprouts leaves and bacon croutons. It was fine, but unremarkable. The table bread was some store bought French loaf- also unremarkable.    With the free dessert ands large party, I got to try a statistically significant portion of the dessert menu.

Saw the waiter maybe once until the rest of the place cleared out. The food was incredibly boring, two of us got the lobster pasta and if there was lobster in that, I would be shocked, it was just awful I didn't eat a bite. The meat lasagna was a large square of cheese - just cheese. The only ""good"" dishes were the shrimp/broccoli pasta which almost had flavor and the mussels appetizer. For the price and decor of the place, there also better be fresh ground pepper - spoiler alert, there wasn't. I can't understand why this is so highly rated or why it was so crowded.

The menu was my initial tip off that we were in store for a good meal. I could barely decide on one thing to eat, since there were so many great options. Even for Italian food which can be pretty standard wherever you go, Sapori Trattoria had interesting takes on classic dishes. My group had the pumpkin ravioli, rigatoni caprese, and the risotto pescatore. Everyone raved about their meals. We also had two bottles of wine, dessert, and limoncello following our meal. Everything was great from start to finish. What make our dining experience even more special was the service that we were given. We had a fantastic waiter, Ted, that kept us laughing all evening and gave us special attention and very attentive service.

It's full bodied flavor is light enough to keep you wanting more, but hearty enough to send you to your Italian food happy place. The portion sizes always yield 2 meals for me (and I'd say for most folks, that also holds true). They have a great wine menu and the service is always phenomenal. And despite its popularity, I've never had to wait for a table even without reservations on the weekend. In addition to the delicious food, the creeky old building Sapori is located in adds to the warm, cozy atmosphere of Italian comfort food. It's a 2 story restaurant with lots of little alcoves, narrow hallways, and seemingly endless, quaint dining rooms.

2015-03-05,4.0,"Sapori is a blast for date night, with an extensive menu featuring some inventive dishes as well as Italian classics. We got Grilled calamari ($11): I always like to see calamari griglia instead of your typical deep-fried calamari rings, and Sapori did this dish justice. The calamari was pleasantly chewy and the balsamic red pepper sauce was tangy and slightly sweet. We might have used the warm, crusty bread to mop up all of that sauce... Squid ink gnocchi ($24): Gnocchi were superb. Small and pillowy, with lots of shrimp and calamari in a bold, slightly spicy arrabbiata sauce. It's just pasta and tomato sauce, in the best way possible, and I'd get this again in a heartbeat. Osso buco ($33): Where do you even get osso buco this gigantic? The veal shank was incredibly tender and the marrow was delicious, definitely no knife needed. The mini lasagna was very good as well. I did think there was too much of the relatively run-of-the-mill tomato sauce that overwhelmed the veal a little. A sauce with more acidity, say a balsamic-based sauce, would have suited the osso buco better. Tiramisu ($7.50): Their housemade tiramisu was light and fluffy with strong espresso flavors, not too sweet. Great way to end the meal. I'm usually not a fan of Italian food because pastas and meats in a hundred variations of cream and tomato-based sauce just don't do it for me.

They don't char it like most places, and they serve it with a delicious balsamic reduction sauce and roasted red peppers. Slight sweetness and tart at the same time. - Penne Cardinale- One of the best pasta dishes ever. Chicken, artichokes, sundried tomatoes- it melts in your mouth. My husband orders it every time we come. - Gamberoni & Broccoli- Delicious! Shrimp, veggies and the sauce is perfection! - Pasta Contadino: So good! Sausage and cauliflower actually go perfectly together- was a bit skeptical at first, but it's amazing.  -Bucatini Carbonara- This is very good, but it's a heavy dish, make sure you aren't hitting the town after eating this one. - Sea Bass: When I'm trying to cut down on carbs, this is my go-to. It's REALLY good..and I don' feel like I'm missing out when I order it. Get extra roasted tomatoes- it pairs perfectly with the sea bass. The only item I've had that I didn't particularly care for: - Rigatoni Caprese (just OK in my opinion, not as flavorful as other dishes)  Also, service is top notch and you get coupons a few times a year (15-16 off  your order) Can't recommend this place enough!!",0.9951,0.703,0.23,0.068,0.4686786786786788

2015-01-20,2.0,"I've been to Sapori Trattoria twice now and both times I left feeling OK about it.  I'll say this - the decor and ambiance is lovely. Quiet (contingent on other dining guests, but they have no control over that), romantic lighting, a place you can get a little dressed up without feeling out of place but also go more casual and feel at home too. The first time I got the lobster ravioli. It was good and I was happy with it. However, I've honestly had better at Bravo... Second time I got the gnocchi with the pesto sauce (can't remember the name) and it was less than great. The sauce/pasta ratio was good but the chicken - EW! Chicken was slimy and tasteless. I took one bite and quickly shoved the rest of the chicken over to the side. The gnocchi was also too soft and mushy... not OK in my book!  Food is also too expensive for the quality, if you ask me. The first time I was there the server was fantastic. Attentive and very nice. Second time, our server was one of those ""I'm going to be your best friend right off the bat"" kind of people. Normally I love this - I love chatting with my server I think it's part of the fun of going out. But this time our server didn't as much say hello to me before 'jokingly' giving me a hard time about everything... little off putting. The desserts looked delicious! However, our server took so long coming back after dropping off the menus to take our dessert orders that everyone at our table, besides one person, gave up on it and just asked for the check. There are so many other restaurants in Lincoln Park to choose from - I would say skip this one.

We started with the Crostini Di Avocado which was fresh and tasty. The avocado was perfectly ripe with a hint of lemon and Parmesan. Then we split the Caesar salad. I loved the dressing which was light and flavorful. The croutons were so crunchy and yummy. For our main course we split the Zuppa di Pesce. This was by far one of my favorite seafood pastas. The sauce was flavorful and full of clams, mussels, scallops, calamari, and bits of what I believe was fish. The portion size was huge...

I recommend it for a date or special ocassion.  Food: I had a veal ossobucco, which was cooked to perfection. The veal was tender and at an appropriate temperature. The meat sauce added zest and richness to the dish. I especially liked the cheese pasta underneath, which added sharpness.  Wine: I was disappointed that the wine list online has not been updated in years. I figured it had not been, since the prices did not match with the age of each bottle. Nonetheless, it was a good selection. I recommend putting older vintages on the regular wine list, as Italian wine does well with age.  Service: Ralph is very knowledgeable about the food and wine. He did well by keeping his distance and waiting for signals from us to move forward, a trait you rarely find in servers.  Bad: The male host was cold and kind of rude.

Let's start with the atmosphere...what an intimate restaurant with a comfortable atmosphere perfect for a date night as well as special occasions like last night.  Had a great table upstairs in front of the window facing Halsted. Our waiter, Peter, was fantastic!  This was our first time to Sapori and he took his time to answer our questions...so many delicious options to chose from! So let's talk about the food!  We started off with the grilled calamari as an appetizer.  I warned Pete I'd had the best calamari of my life in Italy last year, so it was going to be tough to beat...this version didn't beat it, but by far the best I've had since then.  The sauce was so delicious we literally cleaned the plate with the bread.  I had the lobster ravioli which will inspire foodie dreams for nights to come - the pasta was perfect, generous chunks of lobster and a sauce that again was amazing!  Bryan had the carbonara which so help me god I could eat every day of my life!  Pasta was perfect again and that sauce was the best carbonara I've had.  Ever. Period. That creamy smokiness from the bacon, butter, cream and egg alone is a reason to go back!  For dessert we had the hazelnut panna cotta and the tiramisu.  I can make a damn good tiramisu, but the light creaminess of Sapori's beats mine hands down.  As if I didn't have enough of a Nutella addiction, I'll be trying to recreate that panna cotta soon! In addition to the well-priced food menu, Sapori has a great selection of wines.  We had a bottle of Chianti Classico with dinner and a bottle of Prosecco with dessert...both very reasonably priced and the Chianti took me straight back to Florence.

You would expect a nice little sign with cursive writing that said Sappori Trattoria.. but honestly I don't remember seeing an exquisite sign. I just followed the directions, and I ended up in a dimly lit restaurant. My guy friend was a bit confused as to why I took him there... kinda awkward...  We order the fried calamari which was delicious and extremely large. The tomato sauce that came with it was so yummy and tomatoey. He ordered squid ink gnocchi (that's probably not the name) and it was extremely flavorfu and delightfully chewy. I ordered the shrimp linguini; the shrimp was so juicy and yummy and the linguini was so delightfully slurpy and soft. I couldn't eat too much, and I ended up taking 4 servings back home. The food is highly rich, so I would recommend not eating all on your plate. I am sure that was like 10 servings on a plate.  I remember coming here before on a date and my friend and I shared ""romantic"" date talks.  Yep, it's good for a date..Not really a place to take your opposite gender friend.. especially if you don't know them too well.

When we arrived someone noticed we were trying to figure out what to do with our coats, so he right away said he could take care of that.  Everything was ready at the same time (and came out in expected timing), was all the proper temperature, nice presentation, generous servings, and all very tasty.  You could actually share an order of pasta and be very happy.  This is everything we had - all 5*... - Caesar salad - Insalata Mista - Ribs - They nicely agreed to do a half order for my 8 year and she loved them!  No starch with it though, just a plate of ribs (?) - Chicken Parm - 13 year old was so happy - Spaghetti Barese - my dad is not very out of the box and loved this pasta with meatballs and sausage - Pasta Carbonara - I loved it and my 15 year old at the leftovers the next day, loved it too - A dish of f flat tubular pasta with meat and basil ragu - yum, my unadventurous mom loved it - A pasta dish with small noodles (like Orecchiette) sausage, cauliflower, maybe fresh mozzarella (?) - can't recall the name and the menu online is not current (see below). But delicious. The served us a nice piece of tiramisu for my birthday we all shared that was perfect too.  Also extensive wine list. The only thing I would say for improvement is the tables are a little small (narrow and short) when you have two together and are a large party.  Not a lot of elbow room between tables, but it looked like they are sort of under construction so maybe that will improve.  The other thing is the menu online is not their current menu (at all), thus I couldn't refer to it when trying to remember the names of the dishes above.

It was just way to salty and you couldn't avoid it. The calamari was just sitting in a bath of this sauce.  Even though the appetizer was a little bit of a disappointment, the main course was delicious. We both had the lobster ravioli (per yelps reviews) and neither of us was disappointed. Very good. The only other gripe I have with sapori is the fact that for a Sunday evening and then not very busy at all, the service was a bit of a let down.

For now, a 4, but I will definitely come back again and see if this delicious and cozy night out can be repeated.  Our party of four arrived at 5 pm for an early dinner. We had made reservations (online) and were delighted to feel immediately warm and welcome on a cold Saturday night. Needing time to study the many Italian-named dishes on the menu, a couple of us found the house Cabernet Sauvignon (Fox Brook 2005) was quite good and made a nice pre-dinner cocktail at a very reasonable $6.50 a glass. Besides the regular menu items you can find online, the evening's menu carried an entire column full of ""Featured Items"" from starters to multiple pasta entrees (including the pumpkin ravioli one of us ultimately ordered), and a number of meat dishes (including Vitello Osso Bucco and the Duck Leg Confit). Shortly after we sat down, a tray of bread arrived - excellent flavor, with moist crumb and crispy crust. I'd noticed a small bottle of olive oil and a dish of grated fresh Parmesan cheese, but when I (a die-hard butter fan) asked for some, a dish promptly arrived with two large, cold, unsalted slabs thereof. A heaven-sent version of my go-to restaurant indulgence! We shared one order of bruschetta ($6.95) around the table. A generous portion of homemade mozzarella cheese - freshly made, light and tender - was surrounded by shavings of prosciutto and chunks of marinated tomato on toasted slices of that lusty, crusty Italian bread. Another person ordered the Caesar salad - a plateful of crisp, crunchy romaine and some very good homemade croutons, all lightly coated with owner/Executive Chef Antonio Barbanente's own delicately seasoned dressing - delicious if perhaps a tiny bit overpriced for the quantity at $7.95. It was rough going choosing our main courses; almost everything on the menu had its appeal.

2014-11-18,1.0,"So excited to try this place and unfortunately, it was a complete and utter bust.  My girl friend and I went in recently on a quiet Friday night sans reservations. We were seated immediately and only two other tables were occupied.  The restaurant itself is cute - decor is adorable, definitely gives the Italian, romantic vibe. It is small, dimly lit, clean, and welcoming.  The server was nice, a Hispanic woman whose name I do not remember. She knew the menu, made suggestions accordingly and was on top of her A-game when it came to speedy, friendly service.  My complaint is in regards to the most important aspect of every restaurant - the food. I ordered the Pasta Cardinale which has chicken and artichokes. Yes, the serving was huge. But that is about the only positive trait this dish carries. The sauce was overpowering; the few bits of chicken that were on the plate legitimately tasted like the ""fake chicken"" you can order at Subway (which seriously grosses me out), and the artichokes were everywhere. Though I'm a huge fan of artichokes, the ratio made zero sense.  I left with my heart broken and severely disappointed. I was seriously looking forward to this meal and all I got was an inch bigger on the waste line due to some mediocre pasta I could've made better at home.  Sorry guys, I sincerely wish things would've gone differently here. :( Sad Katy. PS. Just remembered - their prices have changed tremendously.

Not as amazing as everyone else is making it out to be, but it was solid Italian food. We had an appetizer of calamari, which I'm very glad to report was fried but not oily. I took all of Yelp's suggestion and ordered the lobster ravioli as my entree and it wasn't bad, but I just don't really understand the hype. A few days later, I can't really remember the taste nor was I left thinking that I can't wait to try it again. (I actually have the leftovers in my fridge right now and I'm not really interested.)

We skipped dessert, but we did have a bottle of wine. I was happy to see a good amount of wine choices; plenty on both ends of the price spectrum.  The service was friendly, but incredibly slow. Were they understaffed? I'm not sure. Plenty of bussers, but we barely saw our waiter. Our reservation was for 8pm. They didn't have our table ready until about 8:10 (and there really isn't much of a waiting area anywhere). It took approximately another 20 minutes before our server even stopped by to say hello and ask for drink orders. By this time, we had eaten all of the bread at our table, ha.  Would I go again?

My personal favorite menu item is the spaghetti with veal meatballs. Really though, it's the meatballs. They're amazing...flavorful, juicy..amazing. I think they do the same meatballs with another seafood dish, but not being a seafood fan I've never tried it. All the other menu items I've had over the years have also been good, so no complaints.

For my entree, I ordered the seafood ""risotto"", more like long grain rice with seafood with a side of an illusion of risotto. That folks, was not risotto but just rice with a price tag of risotto. When I confronted the waiter, he said that they might have run out, that indeed was false. What kind of Italian restaurant has rice onhand? Nope, that is just a ploy to get food enthusiasts to pay full price for risotto because rice is cheaper than arborio rice. I will admit that either the front of the house had class or felt horrible that I was on to them and gave complimentary moscato, but my ""risotto"" was never taken off the bill.

There's no way one person finishes one of those dishes. Something to help justify the hefty prices no doubt. The pesto gnocchi had a couple pieces of chicken but also a number of sun-dried tomatoes.

It's seriously like autumn on a plate. Sweet, savory, and the sage is just perfection! One of the best pasta dishes I've ever had!  - Panna cotta: this was definitely not your average panna cotta. It was actually a chocolate flavor which took me by surprise. They nailed the texture though! Overall, the panna cotta was good, but a little too rich for my personal liking. If you like desserts like decadent chocolate pudding, get this.  Service was phenomenal! 5 stars for the service alone. The manager and server both took great care of us throughout the night. We felt like honorary guests! I would recommend this place just based on the amazing hospitality and service we received.",0.9986,0.598,0.353,0.049,0.5753759398496241

I ordered the meat lasagna, and boy was my boyfriend jealous of it hahah. He ordered a pasta, it was a good pasta, but he wanted something hearty, so it was not that memorable.

Went with two friends using a Groupon.  My entree was great.  I had the milk and honey baby back ribs.  Was a little afraid ordering ribs at an Italian restaurant but our waiter reassured me.  The ribs were great, the flavor was nice, not fatty and very tender.  They were also on a bed of sweet potato straws, which were incredible. Our appetizer was not as impressive.  We had the grilled calamari, and I felt particularly responsible as I pushed it.  I had a similar dish at RPM Italian and it was incredible, still want to go back just for that.  Here the calamari was in a great balsamic sauce but the calamari itself was, well, too calamari.  It was thick and chewy, way too chewy.  I loved the sauce but would not order again. Some other tidbits that got us to a four star rating.  Service was fantastic, our waiter was very nice, always there when we needed him without being too much.  Also, we had a Groupon for four people, my friend (who bought the Groupon) called them about this and they reluctantly agreed to let the three of us use it after we agreed to order well over the $80 of food and alcohol, which has a higher margin.  I give them a plus for agreeing to this, the conditions were clear on the Groupon.  We did go well past the $80, including two bottles of wine, so it was a win-win.  Despite that, when we presented the Groupon, the manager asked if she could cancel the OpenTable reservation we had made.  Bottom line is they made a lot of money on us, despite the Groupon and the fact we were three, and it seemed really petty that she would care so much about the small fee that went to OpenTable.  It meant nothing to us, but my last memory of the restaurant was this pettiness.",0.9973,0.757,0.216,0.027,0.4735294117647058

2014-08-07,5.0,"I have a handful of favorite Italian restaurants in the city and Sapori Trattoria is definitely part of that handful.  The ambiance of this restaurant is classy with white tablecloths, candles, and knowledgeable staff.  In the warmer months there is a patio that has twinkle lights hanging from above and they also have tables inside next to windows that open up. I have gone here with groups (what Italian restaurant isn't good for groups?) and on romantic dates with my husband.  The thing that keeps us coming back is the delicious flavors of the food and the amazing customer appreciation this chef has and continues to show.  Some reasons Sapori Trattoria has amazing customer service is their continued discounts sent to my house for my birthday (and even half birthday) and continued Groupon deals to make for an affordable dinner.  I have also seen the chef come out at the end of the night to talk with his customers which is a nice touch.  Additionally, they have special events during the week that I personally enjoy such as live music and Italian tapas night on Tuesdays (seriously, go for this, it's great with a group and you get to have a taste of many different dishes). As far as the food goes, this restaurant has both traditional and contemporary Italian food.  Here is a list of some of my favorites: The crostini di avocado is UH-MAY-ZING.  This is amped up bruschetta with avocado tossed in deliciousness with sprinkled cheese on top instead of tomato.  Cappellacci Di Zucca is delicious pumpkin stuffed pasta with butternut squash and sage on top with a butter sauce.  It is rich and and the flavors work wonderfully together.  Spaghetti Allo Scoglio is seafood including shrimp, clams, and scallops in a spicy marinara sauce with fresh spaghetti noodles.  Now, if you don't like spicy, our waiter checked to see how hot I liked it before it was prepared so you could probably opt out of any spicy flavors if you wanted.  Now, the tiramisu here is my favorite in the city.  Make sure you save some room because I guarantee you will have dreams about this tiramisu.

Not worth the price on the menu for sure.  The people I went with had a similar opinion of their dishes.  The service during this trip was nothing to write home about but no major issues... Apart from waiting a long time. After a while I decided that I wanted to give ST a second shot seeing as how apparently so many other people love this place.  As it was a weekday evening we didn't have a wait at all and we're seated immediately.  I ordered the bolognese figuring it was a pretty basic Italian dish (as if the lasagna isn't).  When I got it I was again very unimpressed with the dish.  The sauce was very uninspiring and it just left zero 'wow' factor for me.   For all the Italian places in the city it is possible to find one that is better for the same price, or at the very least just as good for cheaper.",0.9569,0.866,0.105,0.029,0.42224279835390943

So first of all, regular pasta doesn't suit me, so I really appreciated that they have whole wheat pasta and you can sub it in for many pastas. That was great. I ended up ordering the Panette Cardinale and it was excellent. Also shared some of the eggplant parm, which was also great. Oh, the appetizers were bruschetta and this other bruschetta-like app with avocado. The avocado topped bread was also great. So yeah, bottom-line, all the food was awesome.

2014-07-08,4.0,"We had an excellent dinner for two here on our last night in Chicago. I had the risotto pescatore and a white wine by glass that isn't listed on the menu online, etna bianco. I wasn't familiar with this type of wine, but it was recommended by our waitress when I asked for a dry white. It was okay; dry enough but too fruit forward for my taste. Would've liked a fuller-bodied and creamier wine. The food was good. When they note ""with a generous portion"" of the seafood they aren't kidding. I appreciated the amount of shellfish they threw in my plate. Nothing better than a copious quantity of mussels, clams, shrimp, scallops, and calamari in a well-seasoned risotto that's not too heavy. Most other places serve mean portions of seafood so this was great. We sat on the outdoor patio on the nice evening, albeit a little too windy (the menu and the after-dinner survey that was given to us were both swept off our table and across the street by the gust). Overall it was a great experience. I imagine chances of nice weather for dinner on the sidewalk patio aren't bountiful in the Windy City. We'd purchased the Yelp deal and made an OpenTable reservation but were told we could only choose one (use the deal or accumulate points through the reservation). Apparently the reservation counted as a promotion/coupon? I looked back at the fine print on the Yelp deal but still thought that was a stretch. But no big deal. The service was really attentive. We had a soft-spoken waitress who was there when we needed her and our glasses of water and basket of bread were always full. Would have loved to try the dessert but we were stuffed after our entrees. Ambiance indoors was semi-upscale, quiet, and intimate. We sat outside in the line of tables by the sidewalk under the lights that were put up in the trees; definitely reminiscent of a plein-air cafe in Europe.

The sidewalk seating at Sapori let us enjoy the night air, and not disturb the other patrons with our funk. The service was excellent, and we weren't rushed despite coming in 45 mins before closing.  The food: Spaghetti allo Scoglio - YES. It was absolutely delicious and they didn't skimp on any of the seafood. I thought it was the best dish of the night.  Crostini Di Avocado - A refreshing way to start the meal. It's like a fresh blast of avocado.  Surprisingly, I wasn't blown away by the Lobster Ravioli that everyone seems to be raving about. I thought it was decent. But I definitely preferred the other dishes.  Also, the Calamari - while it was fine enough, there was nothing unique about it. Fried calamari is mostly the same at any good restaurant.  Also, skip the cocktails. They were so sweet I couldn't even finish mine. And it's rare that I don't finish a free drink. Just go for a bottle of wine.  So make sure your indebted friend brings you here for a free meal!

First of all, it is wayyyy bigger than it looks from Halsted and they can accommodate a lot of people, but I would still recommend a reservation. We almost had trouble getting in on a Wednesday night. The environment is very nice and it has one little thing that sticks out in my mind against a lot of the other Italian restaurants in the area - the tables aren't way too close together. Nothing sucks more than trying to have a romantic or meaningful private conversation when the folks next to you have no choice but to overhear it. Sapori Trattoria gave us just enough space to talk. Now on to the important part - food and wine. They had plenty of wine selections and were great about making some recommendations. The food was phenomenal. I had the gnocchi al brivido and it may have been the best pesto pasta I ever had. I also got to try a bite of the lamb chops and they almost melted in my mouth.

2014-05-31,4.0,"My fiancé and I dined here one Sunday evening to celebrate 10 years of dating.  Crazy, I know. I had a Groupon credit to use and booked my reservation through OpenTable.  I also made sure to specify that we wanted to sit in a more quiet section of the restaurant. Upon arrival, we had a bit of trouble trying to find street parking since a lot of the streets around it required parking permits.  We missed the sign out front stating that patrons could park at Home Depot's parking garage, which is a short walk from the restaurant.  We eventually snagged a spot out front on Halsted for free, which was nice. We were seated in a small dining room off the main dining area.  The section had room for four parties of two and one party of four.  It was secluded and somewhat quiet, which was what I specified.  However, you could hear the hustle and bustle of the goings-on in the kitchen.  Nevertheless, it did not distract us from conversing with each other. We were given paper menus that wished us a happy ten year anniversary.  We got to keep those after the meal to commemorate the experience.  That was definitely a nice touch. We were served with complimentary bread shortly after sitting down.  Our first interaction with our waitress was somewhat awkward since we didn't order drinks right away since we were perusing the extensive wine list.  We put in our order our appetizer first before we placed our wine order.  This had no bearing on her service.  It was just weird she didn't ask again if we wanted something to drink. The Groupon voucher was $47 to be used toward an appetizer, a salad, two entrees and a dessert.  We ordered the fried calamari and Caesar salad to start.  We didn't want to get stuffed so we asked one of the busboys if he could wrap up the rest of the calamari.  He obliged without giving us weird looks about it. The calamari was perfectly fried and was served with an ample amount of red sauce.  Our Caesar salad tasted good, but definitely was a safe and boring choice.  The Caprese intrigued me, but my fiancé despises slice tomatoes so that was a no go. For our entrees, I ordered the Cappellacci di Zucca, which was pasta stuffed with pumpkin in a burnt butter sauce with butternut squash, sage and pine nuts.  It came with 5 or 6 large pastas shaped like ravioli.  I have never had a pasta dish this unique.  It almost tasted like dessert due to the butter and pumpkin elements of the dish.  It definitely was sweet.  The pine nuts added a nice crunch and bitterness, which helped cut some of the sweetness.  I'm not a huge fan of cooked greens so I avoided the sage. My fiancé ordered the Zuppa di Pesce, which was fresh seafood including mussels, clams, scallops, shrimp, calamari, and salmon in a light red sauce over linguini.  You could order it spicy, but he chose to try it as it.  It was served in a huge casserole dish.  He enjoyed it and had plenty of leftovers. For dessert, we tried the chocolate-hazelnut panna cotta, which was on the house.  And, thank goodness it was.  I can safely say that I've met another dessert that I really did not enjoy.  I'm not sure if it was because it was suspended cream.  It had similar qualities to Jello and flan, but was just so weird.  It wasn't particularly light or airy either.  I liken it to pudding, I guess.  We both struggled through it, but eventually finished it.  I definitely think I'll order a different dessert next time. As for our server, she was very sweet, courteous and friendly.  She congratulated us several times on our anniversary.  In fact, she was shocked that we had been together that long since we both look young.  I clarified that it was 10 years of dating and not marriage.  I also told her that we just got engaged last year. Overall, my fiancé and I had a very enjoyable evening.  We signed up to get information about the restaurant's alerts and promotions.  Our server said we'd receive a $15 off coupon to use toward our next purchase.  So, I can safely say we'll be back in the future to dine at this wonderful restaurant again.",0.9955,0.782,0.141,0.077,0.5433473389355742

I'm used to restaurants throwing 4 or 5 shrimp in and calling it a day, but wow, the seafood was abundant! Clams, mussels, scallops, shrimp, calimari...amazing! And at $23? What a bang for my buck! On top of that, their hospitality was so warm and welcoming. Our menus came printed with ""Happy birthday from Sapori Trattoria!"" across the top.

The seating goes much farther back than it appears at first glance, and there's also an upstairs area.

The ambience of Sapori is ideal for a date night.  The dim lighting and dark wood sets the mood for an intimate and romantic evening.  It's pretty quiet in here, so I wouldn't suggest it for any raucous nights with your girlfriends.  Our server was great as well and totally on point with his recommendations. We shared the Burrata appetizer:  Toasted bread topped with tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, basil, and prosciutto.  It's a perfect appetizer for two, but it is so good that I wouldn't mind having this all to myself! For dinner, I wanted to order something a little out of the ordinary.  So many reviews on Yelp talked about the Ricotta Squid Ink Gnocchi with Shrimp and Calamari.  I may have butchered the name a little, but this was a very different dish - in a good way!  The sauce was tangy and spicy, and the gnocchi was cooked perfectly.  Squid ink sounds really unusual, but this dish was really very good, and not something you'd have to acquire a taste for. The portions are fair to large, so don't fill up on that bread basket!  There are a lot of creative and interesting dishes here that I don't think I would be able to replicate at home.  Generally I don't go to a lot of Italian restaurants since I can boil pasta at home, but Sappori is worth a visit because you can get something totally different.  This isn't your typical Mama Meatballs Pasta Factory.",0.9947,0.811,0.189,0.0,0.6171842918985776

The owner/manager is Hispanic and kind of obnoxious for how casual of a place this is... he acts like he owns the most amazing Italian place in the city, definitely not.  The hostess did a nice job, but our server was clueless and clearly just regurgitating a notecard. The bread and olive oil was terrible, tasted freezer burnt and the oil was not good quality. She ordered a pasta dish with chicken and sundried tomato and I got the squid ink gnocchi with calamari (per the servers recommendations) It was a special so I though it would be fresh. Her pasta came out in a huge mound, mine was a much smaller portion. Her pasta was actually really tasty, but tasty in the way that craft mac and cheese is tasty, nothing I would expect from an upscale Italian place. My gnocchi was dry and the calamari rubbery, the red sauce was ok...i was not pleased overall and almost sent it back, but didn't want to bother.  The other thing that bugged me about this place was how dressy everyone was, it was a bunch of middle aged couples that looked like they came from the suburbs for a ""night out in the city"" it was bizarre to say the least.

We split a bottle of wine and had giant pasta dishes, everything was amazing from the server to the food. We were there for close to 3 hours and didn't feel rushed. The second was last Friday for dinner. We were a party of 4, seated upstairs again (why is it so hot up there? is it just me?). We all had appetizers, salads, main dishes, and two bottles of wine - the whole nine yards. Our server was nice and didn't seem annoyed that we were taking our sweet time. One appetizer was like bruschetta but instead of the tomatoes it had avocado (kind of like guacomole, but without all the other stuff in it). Oh. my. gosh it was amazing. My main dish was pumpkin-filled ravioli that I split with a friend and despite all the other food/drink I still managed to eat all of it! There was a slight mix-up (they thought I asked for ""spicy"" when I asked for it to be ""split"") but they fixed it right away and the manager apologized and re-filled all our wine glasses.

2014-04-04,4.0,"TOP FIFTY IN THE USA.... Since Open-Table rated this joint as one of the ""Top Fifty"" Italian restaurants in the USA we wanted to ""taste"" it for ourselves. The pasta is made fresh daily (from scratch) which we appreciate. Some of its more popular dishes include: Homemade pumpkin ravioli; Lobster ravioli; Cappellacci Di Zucca and Osso Bucco. If you are a rib fan you may want to try their ""Milk and Honey"" ribs which were excellent (my husband had these and his final rating was five stars). Their signature dish is the ""Zuppa di Pesce"" (Seafood Soup) which is amalgamated with a variety of fresh seafood and shellfish. This entrée is worth every dime since it has over 1-lb of fresh, delectable seafood. It offers Southern Italian cuisine with a few entrée(s) from Northern Italy. We enjoyed our experience at this casual, but romantic Italian restaurant. It is obvious that they want their customers to feel like they are getting the VIP treatment from the second your foot hits the door.  SERVICE: Excellent and Engaging; Hospitable Servers; VIP Treatment PRICE-POINT: Moderate to High;  FOOD: Innovative and outstanding while other entrée(s) were fairly ""Good"" WINE: Excellent variety -- ask your Server which wine to pair with your dinner Generous Portions.  For starters we tried the Zuppa di Zucca (Butternut Squash Soup) -- a cup goes for 4.75 while a bowl is 5.95 (really overpriced). This soup equals four stars. The cup was very small, so we only got a small taste of the soup. If the soup was Lobster Bisque I would consider it a fair price, but this was not the case. Our MAIN entrée(s) consisted of the following: (1) Cappellacci di Zucca amalgamated with pumpkin in a burnt butter sauce with butternut squash, sage and pine nuts. This is stuffed pasta, and worth four stars.  (2) Pennette Cardinale served with grilled artichokes, chicken, shallots and sun-dried tomatoes in a white wine reduction sauce with a touch of light cream. Five stars (3) Linguini alle Vongole sauteed with fresh clams and garlic in a white wine sauce Five stars; (4) Zuppa Di Pesce (hearty and savory soup with fresh seafood and a ""must"" try). The consistency is more like a stew than soup. It is delicate in flavor and well-balanced. Five stars; (5) Milk and Honey Ribs which were described as ""succulent and incredibly flavorful"" with a unique sauce. Five stars Every Monday, they offer an 8-course ""Family Style"" entrée. It includes two appetizers, two soups/salads, three entrees and dessert. All of this for $20.95 which is a pretty good deal!!!  This is certainly a unique way of getting customers in the door on a day of the week when most people do not go out to eat. They offer a version of Italian ""Tapas"" every Tuesday with ""Live"" Jazz music. We will definitely return on Monday and also for their Tuesday evening Jazz and food experience. We enjoyed our dinner, the service and food. We'll return again, but ONLY for a ""special"" occasion since the price-point does not allow for dining here on a regular basis. Maybe they should consider offering ""half-price"" off on a select few entrée(s) during the week (Wednesday or Thursday). Also, cut the price of dessert by half..... Get me to come here more often (and other customers too)......just sayin'! Overall, the rating is four stars. Yes, I'm a fan, but there are other Italian restaurants in Chicago that are ""as good as it gets!"" The price point on Yelp is listed as ""moderate"" but I would say it is more ""moderate to high"" ($$ to $$$).  Some History: The restaurant opened in 2001, so they are obviously doing something right.  The Chef, Anthony Barbanente, is a Chicago native, but spent most of his life on his grandfather's farm in Southern Italy.

Food: The waitress recommended the Cappellacci all'Aragosta, and thats what I had.   A ravioli-like pasta stuffed with lobster and fresh seafood, pink sauce.  EXCELLENT and very rich.  The lady had a shrimp pasta dish w/ oil that was also excellent.  Entrees are large!  The grilled calamari was a nice app for two. Service: Our table wasn't ready immediately, but we were seated before we even had time to get a drink at the bar (within 5 minutes).  Acceptable being this was Valentines Day on Friday.  We didnt love our first table because it was a little cramped, however they quickly moved us to a table that opened up by the window, and were very nice about it.  My one complaint is the number of tables they crammed into restaurant.  However, we ended up with one that was very comfortable. Our waitress was great.  She had knowledge of the menu and was attentive.  She did put one of our app orders in for another table, so it came a little late.  However, she took it off the bill so not a major problem at all. Besides, we really didn't need a second app given the size of the entrees.   Try an after dinner drink.  Limoncello was tasty. Great management:  A bonus point on top of the 5 stars....Riccardo, the manager, came to apologize for the appetizer mix-up after we had been given our check and bought us two glasses of moscato.  This was not necessary, or expected...as I mentioned earlier, we were completely satisfied with the service.

(e.g. the plating was ordinary and bruschetta bread cold, tough and chewy).  The Minestrone Soup was excellent.

I highly recommend this appetizer for folks who enjoy good seafood. For main dishes, I ordered a seafood gnocchi dish and hubby ordered a seafood risotto dish. Both items were outstanding- the seafood was cooked perfectly (which is hard to do with scallops and calamari!) and were light but filling- unlike Americanized Italian restaurants where you walk out feeling 10 pounds heavier than when you walked in.

For an appetizer we tried the fried artichokes with pancetta.  These were very good.  Just lightly dusted and fried, not greasy.   For entrees we both decided to try pasta.  I did the Spicy Spaghetti with seafood- clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops.  This was solid.  Decent amount of seafood, the sauce was nice and spicy.  I think this dish was around $23.  My husband did a spaghetti with veal meatballs and Italian sausage.  The veal meatballs were good and moist, the sausage was just sausage.  I think this may have been $21 or $22, this may have been a little overpriced for this meal but a pretty good dish overall.   We do want to come back and try some Veal dishes next time but overall a good Italian meal with nice service.  I",0.9936,0.805,0.189,0.006,0.4267009867009866

When I was leaving, the waiter held up my jacket for me to put on and helped me to carry my belongings. We were also offered a comment card to fill out to join the mailing list of the main chef, his personal note in the comment card was extremely rewarding to read.  I ordered the mushroom risotto, very rich, delicious, well balanced and great texture. The other person in my party ordered the vegetarian lasagna. The lasagna was very flavorful, mushroom and squash and zucchini filled. Very hearty. The only complaint is it came with the meat sauce even though we asked for vegetarian and we ended up being charged for the meat sauce. But this is not a big deal, this restaurant is still a hands down 5 stars. The ambiance of the restaurant is amazing, very Italian Tuscany feel with a romantic vibe that is classy and high end. Zero complain and I am so glad we discovered this gem. Ordered 2 entrees and a beer and left with a $75 bill. Not bad for a great meal.

First of all we walked in without reservations and the hostess was very nice, and seated us right away even though we just walked in. Our server Andy was great, he was very helpful and asked us what we like and recommended what he thought was just right for us, and he nailed it!!! I'm not a big wine drinker and don't know much about wine at all so I told Andy we were thinking of having some wine but I don't want anything strong, red or dry. He brought us a sample of a rosé wine that we didn't like so he recommended we try a sparkling rosé, that wasn't what we wanted either so I told him it was fine we weren't gonna have any wine. A few minutes later he brought us one more sample and asked us to just try that one last option. Boom! It was exactly what we wanted.  The Pennette Cardinale was full of flavor, the cream sauce was perfect, no shortage of anything.

I've witnessed other instances where the restaurant will print off special menus wishing people happy birthday or happy anniversary, etc. That kind of dedication to customer service shouldn't go unnoticed.  When it comes to the menu, I'd recommend the following: 1. Zuppa di Pesce - tons of fresh seafood including mussels, clams, scallops, shrimp, calamari, and salmon in a red sauce w/ linguini. I recommend having them prepare it spicy - it's incredible.  2. Milk & Honey Baby Back Ribs - Amazing. Just unreal. So good.  3. Sorbetto - I'm not italian, but it tastes authentic.

It was so cool they printed my husbands name on the paper menu: "" Sapora Trattoria wishes FAISAL a Happy Birthday""  Have to agree with some other yelpers it does get kind of loud, we were next to a party of 30 young adults, so you can imagine. Luckily, we were watching a performance at Stenphen Wolf so we didn't get to the restaurant till 10 pm. The group left shortly after we were seated and than it was just me and my babe. The waitstaff was nice and attentive, we told  them we had a Groupon and unlike some of the other rude places who go all cray cray when they find out you have a groupon, our waiter gave us a smile of assurance and said he will take care of it towards the end. I also got an offer for free Cappuccino as I checked in on yelp and they were nice about it. We skipped appetizers and jumped straight into ordering our main dishes. Food was great, Rissotto Pescatore had a nice spicy kick to it, it included mussels, scallops, calamari, shrimp, and Clams. Huge portions, I just finished the other half of my entree for lunch today. Dear Hubby ordered some kind of lamp shank and according to him the flavors were nice and bold, I had a piece of the grilled potatoes drenched in some kind of sauce from his plate and  it was pretty good.

We obliged and about 15 minutes later, she personally came over and got us. Or waiter was wonderful, personable and very attentive. But the food..... We started with calamari which was way too salty and a bit too chewy for my tastes. I then inquired about eggplant parmesan which was not on the menu but I had seen other yelpers recommend it. Our waiter said he would go ask and came back and said ""no problem"" - so I ordered it. Big mistake. My eggplant was bitter and chewy (which eggplant that is not prepared ahead will be). The chef should not have agreed to make the dish. My companions had the sea bass and the seafood pasta and said their dishes were good, not spectacular but good.

2013-11-01,5.0,"I visited this restaurant during the summer for the first time when a couple friends were visiting from out of town. We sat outside, had appetizers, wine and pasta. All were wonderful :-) I loved it! The service was good and the food was great! They even wrote me a hand written thank-you note when I joined their rewards/coupon club and received my first $14.00 coupon in the mail! In fact, I loved it so much, I recommended it this past week for my close friend's 24th birthday dinner. Even though she'd never been, she agreed and we made a reservation for 7:00pm on a Wednesday. Now, keep in mind, we were 9 twenty something girls all there for a celebration. Not only was our waiter, Matt, friendly and accommodating, he immediately told us he could split bills and food/drinks items whichever way was easiest for us and that theme continued with the rest of the evening.  Since the pasta dishes are a bit larger, a lot of us split them. We shared bottles of wine and split appetizers as well. To top it all off, they specially printed my friend's name on the paper menus for our table: ""Sapori Trattoria wishes Simone a Happy Birthday!"" AND gave us four free desserts to share! (again, very good sized portions). I say all this because I think it's virtually unheard of at most restaurants nowadays. The norm now, it seems, is having a waiter that cringes at the thought of a large party, whines that they can't split the check or accept more than 1-2 credit cards, and replies, ""we have a selection of desserts available for purchase"" when asking if they do anything special for birthdays. It's a birthday. Come on. We all walked out of there feeling wonderful and gushing about the service the entire walk to our next location (a bar). I would recommend this to anyone and everyone who loves good Italian food and wants more heartfelt service from their waitstaff. I will definitely be back with my family and maybe even my own birthday dinner!

Our tall, thin, Caucasian male server had a delightful way about him, very attentive & thoughtful. Sorry I forgot your name and can't find the receipt! And the larger Hispanic manager and bus boys were also very attentive and professional. Our meal was absolutely delicious. Ice cold drinks, (Al Fresco Martini...bartender was definitely not stingy on the good stuff). Piping hot entrées, (Zuppa di Pesce and Risotto Pesce...filled with tons of flavorful seafood). And for dessert, bread pudding with sautéed raspberries...a must try.  I would definitely like to dine indoors right near the large beautiful windows, where it is probably more quiet and romantic. The outdoor area was a bit uncomfortable with the slanted sidewalk & table and those of us dining outdoors being shouted at by the drunk goofs passing and cars beeping like they lost their minds, due to tight parking. But all in all, those minor criticisms don't deter my man and I from the overall wonderful experience we had here. We will be back for you Sapori!",0.9914,0.73,0.223,0.047,0.6169191919191919

We got there and after 40 minutes of waiting, we were finally seated at a table with no silverware (I'm pretty sure we ended up taking some from a neighboring empty table ourselves). The service was good enough, although it seemed fairly understaffed. We put the food order in pretty soon after sitting down and after about an hour the food finally came out. We were only updated once that the kitchen was backed up. When we finally got the food it was great...but all three of us felt like crap the next day. 2 1/2 hours for a later dinner we had reservations for is absolutely ridiculous.  The food itself:  * Fried calamari appetizer: very good, standard calamari * Lobster Ravioli: tasted awesome but I'm almost positive this is what made me sick * Sea bass: My friend ordered the sea bass and the first bite was all bones, but the rest was really good  * Lasagna: Another person got the lasagna and it was massive! Unfortunately he also ended up with an upset stomach For a place with such great reviews (and a price tag to match) I had much higher hopes.

We both then got house specialty dishes. One was home made noodles with lobster and other seafood in pink sauce, per the menu. It turned out to be 5 pieces of lobster ravioli. It was not bad, but nothing special- definitely not worth $23. It was like almost $5 per piece. The other specialty dish was spaghetti with mussels and clams. It was absolutely tasteless.

Another great touch is their follow-up, they send out Birthday Cards with discounts and not in a constant-obnoxious-kind-of-way either.

2013-08-13,4.0,"Sapori Trattoria, I tip my cap to you. I came here with friends for a wine dinner, and I couldn't have been happier with my experience on the whole. Since we were a group of 7, we decided on basically treating everything family style. We started of with a round of the bruschetta and the caprese. The bruschetta was just killer. There was just the right amount of everything on it. The caprese also made the perfectly compliment. The tomatoes melted when you ate them. After the round of appetizers, we continued with the mushroom risotto. This was also a great way to start things off. The risotto was done perfectly and the mushrooms really added a savory quality we didn't have in the first two dishes.  On the main dishes, we started off with the Bolognese. I was a real fan of the sauce as there was a good amount of meat. It wasn't all meat though and the sauce was savory to work perfectly with our barolos. Since we had Barolos in front of us, it was only natural to get the Osso Buco. This turned out to be the great choice we all thought it would be. There is a lot of it here, so it really did work best having the smaller portions doing it family style.  The service was really good as well. Our waiter was always available for us and it was never a problem getting our orders.  The entire experience makes me definitely want to come back here, and I'm very certain a return will happen. Needless to say, I'm very much looking forward to it as the bar is now set pretty high.",0.9933,0.796,0.181,0.023,0.5541461412151067
2013-08-12,5.0,"Descriptive phrase: high-end Italian done well. To be brief, Sapori Trattoria serves delicious and perfectly-executed traditional Italian dishes in a classy setting. The old duplex it's housed in is beautifully furnished but not quite large enough for the crowds Sapori commands. That being said, it's still a nice experience. Our waiter: attentive and knowledgeable. The owner/manager: friendly and welcoming. The chef: accommodating to a unique request (we can't take my dad anywhere).  My Manhattan was perfect. The Minestrone (cup: $4.75) offered no new twist on the classic, but was simply prepared with excellence. The Spaghetti allo Scoglio ($21.95) was the crown jewel, though. Simple spaghetti pasta sauteed with marinara sauce and mussels, clams, shrimp, and scallops. There is nothing to nit-pick about this dish. The seafood tasted fresh and light, the sauce accentuated the shellfish without being gobbed-on, and the pasta was the vehicle on which this all traveled. I cannot recommend Sapori Trattoria enough.

Planning a girl's night out and I wanted somewhere with good food within a reasonable price and Sapori constantly showed up on my search and Yelp rarely ever steers me wrong. Upon arrival we were seated upstairs upon arrival and greeted by our server who was great with suggestions and patient with our indecisiveness as it was our first time. We were torn between calamari and bruschetta and our server recommended the bruschetta ( yelp.com/biz_photos/sapo… ) and kudos to him because they were some of best we've ever had! Packed with garlic flavor and a generous portion that after your first bite you'll have tomatoes falling onto you plate. We than each ordered an entree and shared them family style: Lobster Ravioli ( yelp.com/biz_photos/sapo… ): heard so much buzz about this dish and it fell short. The ravioli were generous and stuffed well, but there was something off about the sauce, a bit too sweet in our books. One of my girlfriend had this the last time she was here and said it definitely taste different and wasn't as good. Lamb Chops ( yelp.com/biz_photos/sapo… ): these lamb chops were cooked perfectly, but lacks some flavor from the sauce. Classic Lasagna ( yelp.com/biz_photos/sapo… ): our favorite of the night! This is definitely a classic done amazing well, meaty, cheesy, noodles, all the right portions, and deliciously flavorful. Seafood Risotto ( yelp.com/biz_photos/sapo… ): calling seafood lovers, this is your dish! Packed with all types of seafood: mussels, clams, calamari, and shrimp and scallops! I greatly enjoyed this and the flavorful of it, but a few thought it could use more seasoning. Our food did take some time getting to us after our bruschetta and our server literally disappeared towards the end of our meal so it took us awhile to wave him down and pay for our bill, but we did enjoy dinner because of the company, but left not completely satisfied with our food choice of the night.",0.9966,0.705,0.217,0.079,0.5413938492063493
2013-08-05,5.0,"After going back and forth between 4 or 5 stars, I've finally decided to give Sapori Trattoria 5 stars because they truly deserve it! I have so many reasons why 5 stars is appropriate here, so let me begin... I made reservations a couple days before through Open-table for a Friday night for 6 people with absolutely no problems. They called to confirm that night and asked if we are celebrating a special occasion and I told them that it was my sister's birthday (they asked for her name).  When we got to the table, all the menu's had ""Sapori Trattoria Wishes Julia a Happy Birthday"" - how sweet is that?! I actually knew they did it, but everyone else was pleasantly surprised. Our server was great - incredibly attentive and I have no issues with anything. The only complaint I have is that the entire dinner took way too long, but no one was in a hurry, so it ended up being OK. He took our drinks/appetizers right away, but did not ask what we wanted for our entrees until after we were done with the apps. He could have asked earlier, but it's OK. He brought us incredibly fresh bread (probably right out of the oven) to the table a couple of times, and we ended up all stuffing ourselves with it. We also ordered fried calamari and a dish called Crostini Di Avocado - it's very similar to what a bruschetta is, but it was way better and topped with a delicious, creamy avocado.  For dinner, I had the Vitello Portafoglio - a Veal dish with fresh mozzarella, provolone, Parmesan and basil sauteed in a veal reduction herb sauce sun-dried tomatoes - oh my God, it was so amazing I almost finished the entire entree though I was so full. My sister had the Chilean Sea Bass - I tried a piece and I must say that it was probably the softest, melts in your mouth fish I've ever had - amazing!  Besides the outstanding food and service, we were allowed three free cappuccinos with a Yelp check-in. He said it's usually only one per customer per table, but he allowed it any way. We had two tiramisu's for dessert (one with candles) and at the end, he brought us all glasses of bubbly which was a great surprise.  I definitely recommend this place for a celebration because they go all out to make you feel special. It gets pretty tight in there and louder than most places, but it's worth it - my only suggestion if crowds/loudness is not your thing is to go on a quieter night, but judging by the reviews, they might not have a quieter night :)",0.9984,0.765,0.209,0.026,0.6382558139534885

Checked in at appropriate intervals without hovering. The food:  Stella salad was sublime and the Pasta Contadina is to DIE FOR. Subtle, rich but not super-creamy, great depth of flavors.  One in our party had the veal and declared it the best he's ever had, even when compared against meals in Italy.   I didn't give 5 stars because the bolognese was fairly average-- not a very rich meat flavor. I don't think they browned it enough, it was just ""cooked"". One other nitpick is that the pasta came out to the table insanely hot-- not the dish, the food itself.  It burned my mouth and was too hot to eat for at least 5 minutes.

2013-06-20,4.0,"My boyfriend and I had dinner here Tuesday night, toting our Groupon. They were SUPER friendly when I called to make the reservation unlike at many other places when they groan the second that the word-that-rhymes-with-coupon is mentioned. It seems that they offer a lot of these deals. The parking was very easy and accessible (free access to the Home Depot garage practically next store - an AWESOME perk of dining there!)  The restaurant was really cute inside. Loved the little Christmas lights hanging from the walls. It looks like they have a cute patio for when the weather finally heats up. I would suggest making a reservation, I'm pretty sure most people had them. We were seated at a table right near the front door so it was pretty drafty, I would suggest asking for a table further in the back if you can get it (oddly our reservation was at 7, but it didn't start getting crowded until around 8 when it got jammed).  The service was pleasant and the food was very good. I got some type of appetizer special - it was some type of garlic bread topped with mozzarella, tomatoes, and prosciutto. Absolutely delicious. My boyfriend got the caesar salad which he thought was decent (it had a bit of a tangier taste then a normal caesar salad - I thought it was great but I could see how one might not like it).  For dinner he had the salmon which he thought was very good. I had the rigatoni caprese (noodle tubes with a marinara type sauce and slightly melted mozz - SOOO good!!). I didn't really happen to like any of the dessert choices on the menu, so we got the bf's fave. The tiramisu for dessert was surprisingly a huge winner. I don't normally even like tiramisu, but it was very good.  The reason that I am deducting one star is for the prices of this place. Granted, I had a Groupon, but even then with tax/tip and no drinks I still shelled out around thirty dollars per person. I would imagine without a Groupon it would be pretty steep. The pasta dishes were all around $20 each, which is a several dollars more than what you would normally pay for a comparable Italian restaurant in the area. It seems like they offer a lot of deals and coupons, so maybe that is their strategy (to just charge more and then offer a lot of deals)? Not too sure. I would CERTAINLY come back, the food was excellent, but probably not without some sort of a coupon.",0.9985,0.771,0.22,0.009,0.6074084872044057

Both appetizers are failures in our opinion. The fried calamari is too heavily breaded and has no flavor at all. The breading forms a coat and is falling off the calamari as you pick a piece up. The butternut squash soup is so heavy and sweet that it is simply a sauce, rather than a soup. You cannot have two spoons of it in a row.  The entree, seafood risotto, is the best out of the three. It is pretty flavored, even though my husband thinks the rice a bit dry. Overall, this place does not live up to the expectation.",0.5935,0.807,0.103,0.09,0.5140816326530612

The tapas portions were perfect for an individual: I had a glass of wine, the avocado crostone appetizer, the zucca entrée, and tiramisu The Avocado Crostone was absolutely delicious, good olive oil and avocado flavours, not too bold, not too bland. The pumpkin zucca, one of their signature dishes, was very good, and the tiramisu was very light and tasty. Altogether, the meal was excellent.

2013-06-08,5.0,"Conosco i miei polli... So yeah, I'm a BIG FAN. First off, it took my husband and me two trains to get here and it was well worth the ride. I made our reservations via Open Table and made a specific request for a corner booth/table that is a little quiet. We arrived about 18 minutes early to which they told us that they were working on my request. Once 8pm arrived (our reservation time) the front of the house manager came to us and said that he didn't want us to wait any longer for ""that table"" that he had in mind. It was refreshing that for once a restaurant actually read my Open Table request.  Nicely done. The restaurant was larger than we expected. Two rooms with tables stacked. We sat in the back room at a two-top against the wall. Nice ambiance. Perfect place for a nice date night except for one thing - ITS LOUD! This was our first time here so maybe it was more of the people sitting around us, but at times during the beginning of our dining experience, we were almost in a yelling match trying to hear each other. We ordered a bottle of wine which may have helped...After we each downed a glass, we were able to drown out most of the other conversation.  **Our server MATT was awesome. Very attentive yet not overcrowding. THE FOOD: Simply delicious. Matt our server said that their motto is Quality AND Quantity. He was absolutely right. Everything was served in large portions and both my husband and I had ""I can't stuff anymore food down my throat"" boxes once we left. Anyway... GRILLED CALAMARI - outstanding. I would hop on two trains and a bus to come here for it. I don't even know if words will do it justice. JUST ORDER IT! Your taste buds will thank you! ENTREES - Linguini and clams and gnocchi. Both of which were spectacular however one thing about the gnocchi. It's covered with pesto. I mean a LOT of pesto. My husband who is a loves pesto even said it was too much for him. All the pasta is fresh made here BTW.  DESSERT - tiramisu. ORDER IT. So good. Pair it with an espresso or cappuccino.

If they're as good as all you yelpers say, why the need for so many coupons to bring in a crowd? And if they're willing to serve everyone on a deal, why not just lower the prices and not have the deals at all? Because the prices are a little steep without the deal. And with so many out there, I would never come here without a coupon in hand. Anyway, armed with a groupon, I brought my friend in here for her birthday so I was ""cheaply"" treating her. We ordered a bottle of wine and started making decisions as we had to share a salad, an appetizer, and a dessert, with our entrees being our own.  For our appetizer, we went for the grilled calamari and it came out as a very large portion of tentacles with peppers in a nice balsamic sauce. Cleaned the plate. We chose the Stella for our salad and were pleased when it came out on two separate plates. That always makes sharing easier. And with the size of the halved portions, this could easily make for a nice entree salad. Light and fruity, we enjoyed it. For my entree I chose the cheese-stuffed veal scallopini and it was just ok. I probably would have been happier with a pasta choice, but I wanted to try something different. For the amount of food on this plate, the price of $27 was pretty high. The best part of the meal was the hazelnut panna cotta. As full as we were, we were fighting over the last bite. Even though I used a groupon, with the wine, I still paid dearly for my dear friend's birthday so I didn't feel like I was being cheap at all. I find it surprising that so many reviews think this is a nice meal on a budget, when even with a coupon, my purse felt a lot lighter (though my tummy was definitely a lot heavier!)

When we arrived, there was a long line - some even going out the door! I told the host we had a reservation, but unfortunately we still had to wait an extra 15-20 min. I was a bit upset because in a way it defeats the purpose of a reservation. Anyway the manager or some host who was in a suit gave us our table. He later apologized for the delay in our table because a prior reservation was late which caused the domino effect on all the other reservations afterwards. He mentioned he didn't like to do that to his customers so he gave us his apology.  As for the food, my husband and I started with the bruscetta and mussels. Bruscetta was eh...it was okay. Was hoping for yummy bruscetta, but the bread is really the bread that is served (complimentary) to every table before your meal comes. We ordered mussels in red wine because our waiter said it would be spicy. Sauce was a bit spicy but my husband and I were disappointed in the outcome of the mussels. We had way better elsewhere. As for the entree, I ordered the spaghetti with veal meatball and Italian sausage dish. It was good. I like the noodles and the sauce. My husband ordered the Pasta Cantoni? (not sure if I spelled that correctly). It was smothered in sauce..pretty heavy. He felt the meal was too heavy for his liking. He thought it was just okay. I had a taste of his pasta.

2013-05-06,5.0,"This review is only for the seafood risotto and the seafood pasta.  We've only come here with groupons because they are offered so frequently and otherwise it would be a little too expensive for us.  The first time we went I got the Chilean Sea Bass and my partner got the ribs, but we were pretty underwhelmed.  However, they had those pesky groupons offered so often so we gave it another chance, especially since it gets such high reviews on Yelp.  So we went in and just got mussels as an appetizer (super yum), lobster ravioli (my partner wanted more), and seafood risotto (the clear winner of the table).  Last night we went again and my partner got the seafood spaghetti and I got the seafood risotto and again, both were spot on.  The restaurant is very generous with their seafood, and each component of our dishes were cooked perfectly.  So in the end, get the seafood risotto, and ask for it to be spicy :).",0.9783,0.844,0.141,0.015,0.6272222222222222

2013-04-29,4.0,"My recent trip to Chicago brought me to Sapori Trattoria, which I really wanted to try. I would recommend advance reservations if possible as walk-ins can be difficult to accommodate--especially on weekends. I loved the food, the service was great (wait staff are very attentive, even when it's crazy-busy, I liked that a lot), and the ambience was very nice as well--a good choice for a date or celebration, and suitable for groups as well. You wouldn't know it when you walk in but the place is a decent size, as there is also a dining area in the back. I had the burrata which is not always easy to find on menus, and when you do, it's not always great but Sapori's was LUSCIOUS and filling~ The creamy ball of cheese came with fresh basil leaves, crostini and thinly-sliced prosciutto, which was a bonus. This app is probably best shared as it can get filling. I ran out of crostini and ended up having to dig into the bread basket for more carb to go with the burrata, so I was pretty stuffed by the time my pasta came, but I kept on truckin'~ Not a fan of gnocchi, I ordered it anyway and boy was it good--a little overcooked but a nice huge pile of homemade gnocchi bathed in pesto with quite a bit of juicy, white chicken meat. I liked that there were chunks of pinenuts in there (for texture, and the nutty flavour) and you could definitely taste the fresh basil with each bite. Even I was surprised that I could not get through a quarter of the dish! It actually tasted even better the next day. What I loved most was how fresh the food was, you could actually taste the freshness. I would have expected to pay more for what i got but not so: prices are not over the top but definitely not crazy for what you get, and not just the quantity of food but especially the quality--totally worth it.",0.9974,0.754,0.223,0.022,0.601219512195122

2013-04-26,2.0,"Frankly I am blown away by the quantity of positive reviews for this place.  Having eaten some outstanding Italian food at a variety of establishments throughout Chicago, I can assert that this restaurant rests far and away at the bottom of the pile. Let's start with the positives.  The atmosphere was fine (albeit almost comically generic).  The music was played at a satisfactory volume (and who doesn't love a bit of Herbie Hancock with their Burrata).  The service was passable (though not what I would call warm and inviting).  And the wine list was adequate for a restaurant of such stature. Onto the negatives - specifically, the food. Look, I don't know how to say this other than: it was bad and it was expensive.  Now, I'd like to believe that those who have extended five-star reviews to this joke of an establishment had reason to do so and are not merely blood relatives of the staff, but quite frankly I can't imagine any scenario in which this would be the case.  To begin with, a meal consisting of 1 appetizer, 1 salad, 1 entree and 1 bottle of wine (all shared between two people) put us at close to $100.  This, of course, is fine if you are Spiaggia or Piccolo Sogno or Socca or Topo Gigio or basically any Chicago area trattoria or ristorante that has even the slightest understanding of flavor or creativity when it comes to its dishes.  Instead, we were plated the sort of bland, uninspired, faux-Sicilian slop that even your average Olive Garden patron would fall asleep halfway through eating. I don't remember anything that we consumed  being served what one would call ""warm,"" and while the food wasn't outwardly offensive, it did make me regret not simply staying home with a packet of Buitoni and a jar of Prego.  At least then my palate would have enjoyed some sort of stimulation. The biggest slap in the face came with the check, when I realized there were about 10 restaurants within a 2 block radius where I could have had a much better meal for a significantly smaller chunk of dough.  These include Barrio, Kuma's Too, Raj Darbar, Noodles in a Pot, and hell, even Kentucky Fried Chicken.  Yes, I am 100% serious. At the end of the day, I guess this place is fine if you're some Wrigleyville bro lookin' to impress that fly honey you met at Big City Tap last Friday night.  But for anyone who cares even the slightest about things like taste, nuance, and deliciousness, this is not a place for you.  I for one, will not be coming back.",0.9856,0.829,0.129,0.043,0.5215891635246475
2013-04-26,2.0,"My boyfriend and I grabbed a late dinner after a movie and were sat immediately (which I expected with a reservation). For all of the advertisements I've seen, I was surprised to see how fancy it looked inside. It's rare to find white table clothed restaurants in Lakeview. The food really was disappointing. We never experienced the warm, delicious bread that other reviewers praised. We ordered the burrata appetizer and though the cheese was good, the accoutrements that accompanied it were nothing exciting. I'm sure after a few glasses of wine, the appetizer piled high with prosciutto would be salty and delicious, but that shouldn't be the main element of the dish when it's described as a burrata appetizer.  The salad was sad to say the least. I was expecting a plate of hot, perfectly grilled asparagus with a tasteful drizzle of lemon vinaigrette and some crumbled goat cheese, but instead, it was chopped up cold grilled asparagus on a bed of greens with lemon wedge on the side. It was quite bland and really had no creative or artistic vision behind the dish - it felt like they wanted to give us what was left over in the kitchen. I would have rather had what was described on the menu in place of what we ate.  And finally, the Yelp-raved pumpkin ravioli was a bore. The crunchy, though oily butternut squash cubes really saved the dish. The ravioli pasta was nice and thin, but the filling was really bland. To top it off, the burnt butter sauce I was looking forward to was had no distinct nutty flavor, but just felt like a puddle of melted butter. Overall, I was appalled by the price of the food - it was EXTREMELY expensive for the quality.  We both have had MUCH better food in this city for the same price or less. On top of all of this, I disliked the service. Yes, he did everything correctly, and even split the entree to make sharing easier, but really didn't care much about us, wasn't very helpful with the dinner or wine menu, and made us feel rushed, as though the restaurant was closing, yet it was open for another half hour with people still dining as we left. If you're working at a restaurant in Lakeview, you should know that your shift won't end till midnight or later, so suck it up. I am not planning on returning. So not worth your money.

Instead he just listed off his favorite dishes and pointed out that some dishes were ""featured""...which is clear from the menu. I know how to read. Also, all the things he listed as favorites were things I couldn't eat, and it took a seriously long time.  I'd go back if I were guaranteed that this was just a quirk of that one waiter.

Milk braised pork ribs were very, very flavorful but they needed a textural element to add contrast to the dish and a dollop of polenta would have helped cut the richness. Lobster capellaci were good, not great - the filling was dense and lacked lobster flavor. The mushroom risotto was delicious with tons of mushrooms but also lacked some brightness.

2013-03-13,2.0,"Was completely ""underwhelmed"" at this place.  The ratings and reviews made it seem like it was going to be a genuine experience, but not so for us.  The host is this big guy that makes you feel like you're interrupting his life.  Might have been that he spends most of the time on his cell phone as your standing there.  He's on the phone as he walks around the restaurant.  He will stand in the way of the runners while - yep - talking on his phone.   It's a small place with seating in the front and the back.  As the noise level was pretty high in the front we asked to sit in the back so we could talk.  There's also a little more room back there where the tables in the front are pretty packed in/close together. While it was quieter from a ""customer"" perspective - meaning not as many, less chatter, it's NOT as quiet from the kitchen, food runners, etc.  It's a little like a ""runway"" back there with a center aisle that they literally are running back/forth on - that is when the host isn't standing in their way on his phone.   While we like a nice ambiance, we came for the food.  Unfortunately, it didn't deliver.  It was rather boring, flavors were weak, temperatures weren't correct and while it was ""ok"" it's not anything worth coming back for.   To be honest, it was a big disappointment from what we had expected.  Wasn't the worst and the food is ok, but with so many better choices with better food and a staff that know how to act like restaurant staff - why spend your money here?  Can't see that happening again for us.",0.986,0.785,0.155,0.059,0.45614285714285707

2013-03-11,4.0,"I'd definitely come again. I went here with my foodie cousin on a Groupon deal: 1 app, 1 salad, 2 mains, and a dessert.  We started with the avocado crostini...wow!  I love avocados anyways, but this was a great way to start the meal.  It had tomatoes, cheese, and was a neat take on (sort of) a bruschetta.  Definitely recommend. Next we had the Stella salad.  They split it up in two bowls for us, and I also loved this one.  The champagne dressing really hit the spot...I love champagne. Next, my cousin had gnocchi and I had the lasagna.  These were both tasty, though nothing spectacular.  It was probably the only part of the meal I wouldn't get again.  Don't get me wrong, both were very good, but I didn't think they compared to the first two courses we had.  And a word of warning, I think the lasagna is actually 3 meals worth, so be prepared to take some home. To finish, we had to pick a dessert.  I asked the waiter what his fave was, and he suggested the panna cotta.  i groaned, b/c I'm not a huge fan of panna cotta.  But I agreed since he was pretty certain about it.  Man...he was right.  It almost tasted like a chocolate mousse, and it was very tasty. I also had a nice glass of wine, which was the featured one that night, for a fairly reasonable price. All in all, the Groupon price was DEFINITELY worth it...$47 for all of that (excluding the wine), and both my cousin and I took leftovers home.  They seem to have other specials throughout the week that I would look into. One last comment, I found the service to be nice (maybe a tad slow, but nothing crazy).  And the atmosphere is very nice too.  All in all, I recommend this place for a nice Italian dinner!",0.998,0.718,0.26,0.022,0.5566294642857144

I forgot what it was called but it had fresh Romanian lettuce with this amazing honey-raspberry vinaigrette tossed with crisp apples and  a few raspberries. Anyway let me start from from the begging, we ordered mussels for our appetizer they were delicious but the sauce was to die for, my friend and I kept on ordering bread (which was hot, from the oven and free!) to dip in it. Let me just say this restaurant does not go  light on the sauce!!! I ordered the veal which I liked but I wish I ordered something different only because I never tried veal and I found out I didn't like it but I ate it all because it was still good! lol.

My dad, 86 years old and not easily impressed, was IMPRESSED.  He grew up in a time when customers were the priority, and as he sees customer service fall away, he has gotten more and more disappointed.  He was anything but disappointed with the service here.  Our waitress, Angela (I think that was her name), was patient and very attentive.  Ricardo was on top of EVERYTHING.     Without my knowledge, the restaurant made menus that had ""Happy Birthday Dianne"" written at the top and laid each on at every place setting.  The atmosphere was quiet and cozy with candle light and exposed brick.  My parents were extremely comfortable and happy.   We didn't have to yell over loud music or a noisy atmosphere.  It was elegant and perfect. Now to the food!  I am gluten and dairy free, so Ricardo made me feel very at home.  They made me a pasta dish from scratch using gluten free pasta.  It was DELICIOUS!  All of our meals were wonderful.  Not one complaint.  The flavors are rich and authentic.   We were there until after closing, and we never felt rushed to leave.  It was a wonderful experience, and I am just so grateful that my mom had a special birthday.  I would recommend this place, hands down, to anyone.",0.9957,0.713,0.207,0.08,0.6683612183612184

The coffee served in the carafe was cold. I raised the issue with the manager; but nothing was done about it. The dessert is not exemplary and common bistro dessert fare. Adding insult to injury, the manager asked our party to leave to free up the table for other patrons waiting; when in fact we were just waiting for our bill to be rectified. One couple's bill read $ 1.62 only which took within normal time to rectify it. The manager was rude and did not gather his facts with our server to assess the reason for the wait. Instead, he approached one of my guest to inform us to leave. NOT GOOD FOR BUSINESS! My guest returned him that he was rude and explained to him the reason for the wait. It left a bad taste in my mouth and the manager did not offer any apologies. He lacks the skill set to be a restaurant manager in what may have been a stressful who did not handle the dinner rush crowd very well.

2012-12-16,4.0,"I took my wife here for her birthday with a Groupon that gave us 1 appetizer, 1 salad, 2 entrees and a dessert. Service: This place has top, top service. When we first got there, we were shown a table for 2, but the host asked us if we preferred to wait for 10 minutes to get a better table in the back. We agreed because the table was right near the door and the winter winds were blasting in cold air. We were rewarded with a cute table in the back corner, screened off from the hustle of the hallway. Our waitress was incredibly kind and polite. She could have come back more often - or just left a pitcher of water on the table - but the place was jammed and I think they were understaffed. A- Entree: We split the muscles in white sauce. This is a pretty standard dish and Sapori offers nothing new or original. I think I would have preferred the red, but I really have no complaints. The muscles were well cooked and buttery. B Salad: We again split this one and ordered the Caprese salad. Meh. I was actually disappointed that an Italian place could serve a mediocre caprese salad. It was under seasoned and the olive oil served with it had no real flavor. I actually used the salt and pepper shakers on the table (something I haven't done in years) to flavor the dish ever so slightly. That said, everything tasted fresh and light and just simply needed some better ingredients. C- Entrees: I ordered the Ossobucco and was greeted with a plate of super rich, super awesome heaven. I've never had this dish before, so I have no basis of comparison, but it was really good. I only did finish half. The veal shank is served atop a mini meat lasagne which provided a nice break from the dish and gave a different texture and flavor. At $33, I don't know if I would order this again, but I was certainly not unhappy with my choice. My wife ordered the lobster ravioli and she cleaned the plate up. The lobster ravioli was served with some apple chunks, which we thought was just odd, but I guess they were there to cut through the sauce which was slightly tangy and think. A- Dessert: We ordered the tiramisu. This was a throw away dish. I was fine, a standard dessert to end the meal, but I was not really happy with it. The ladyfingers were either not soaked and simply drizzled with espresso or they used really subpar espresso. The chocolate sauce served on the side came straight from a bottle marked ""Hershey's"" or the equivalent there of. Again, for $7, I don't think this dessert warranted the price. C+ In the end, I'll rank Sapori Trattoria a good solid B. I would gladly go back and invite other people to come with me.

Service was great, the waiter started delivered a decently funny joke and then gave some recommendations which I always appreciate. I ordered the grilled calamari appetizer to start which had a great roasted red pepper sauce.  I was pleased with that because I'm a huge fan of grilled calamari but the dish wasn't anything crazy amazing.  After that I had the meat lasagna as recommended by our waiter.  Whlie the portion was huge, I didn't feel that it was that good.  Portion sizes in general are huge here for the entrees which left us with plenty of left overs.  Either way, the lasgna had a little too much pasta compared to meat and the sauce wasn't anything too too amazing.  As for the rest of the group, we had the pesto gnocchi which were the best of the table.  Light gnocchi with a great pesto sauce and other goodies (chicken and sun dried tomatoes).  We also had the bucatini (pasta thats kind of like spaghetti with a hole in the middle) in a carbonara sauce with pancetta.   While this dish was delightfully decadent, it was so rich that it would have been hard to put down a whole plate of this and do anything afterwards other than sit in front of your TV watching a storage wars marathon.

I ended up going with the Rabbit Ravioli, while my date had a calamari gnocchi with squid ink. Both dishes were fantastic and the sauces were subtle but flavorful.

First, I must commend the restaurant on service. Our server, Mr. McDonald (missed his name but creeped on the bill to see his surname) was first-class- as their website notes ""high-service in a casual atmosphere""- exactly! always available yet not nagging or pushy. He suggested the right amount of food for five and did not have us over ordering. However, Mr. McDonald and I do have different opinions on the best dish of the house. He recommend the Calmari Griglia as an appetizer, noting its his absolute fav. Well, sorry, not the highlight of my dinner but interesting none the less. The bus boys were on top of things, ready to serve, and quick with our butter request. Using the Groupon was a breeze, and claiming a complimentary Cappucino after checking in was icing on the cake. A+ for service. And sorry Mr. McDonald for blushing when my mom had to point out my elite status to the server. Thanks Mom (my #1 fan)   On to food, the caesar salad and caprese salad were presented so beautifully I felt a little remorse toppling the tomato and cheese piza. Caprese was delish. For entrees, we noshed on Gnocchi al Brivido, Cappellacci di Zucca, and Spaghetti Barese. If I had to pick one, pick the gnocchi. Interesting medly of flavors and pleasing to the taste buds.

I recommend making a reservation for any time you go. Ordered the grilled calamari as an appetizer and it didn't disappoint. Very different from the fried version but extremely good. We ordered the lobster stuffed ravioli and lasagna for our entrees. Both are popular choices and very good. Service was beyond great. Haven't had a good server anywhere in a very long time but Matt was our rockstar waiter that night. He was extremely attentive and knowledgable about the menu items.

I give them credit for having warm bread.  If an Italian joint doesn't have warm bread, you should walk out immediately. We ordered an appetizer I don't see on their online menu.  It was similar to bruschetta, but with cheese and prosciutto.  $10 for two mini slices of toast?  Pass. I had the Milk and Honey Baby Back Ribs.  I figured they'd be disgusting or amazing.  In the end, they were mediocre.  Props for having the meat fall right off the bone.  But it tasted bland.  Only a hint of honey.  No other real spice or flavor.  For nearly $30, they're not worth it. My girl asked the server which pasta she'd recommend.  The server was surprisingly candid about which she preferred.  My girl ordered the one the server recommended against.  The server was right. Because my girl was so disappointed, the server tried to make up for it with a free tiramisu.  That was pretty good, although I'm not a tiramisu guy.  Still, the gesture is worth noting. The service is the true highlight of Sapori Trattoria.  The prices are a little out of whack.  Maybe I'll find a new dish I prefer on a second visit.  I may return.",0.9745,0.746,0.177,0.076,0.549509604978355

Although, the place was small it did have a great decor and very relaxed atmosphere. I didn't like the paper menus that were waiting on the plate. Also, the tables were very small, so small that when our dinner finally arrived a quarter of the plate was off the table.  The One thing that i have to point out above everything else is the prices. most entrees were over 20 bucks which kinda ""blew"" me.

2012-11-14,2.0,"I definitely was not impressed with this restaurant and that bums me out because the reviews seemed so great I was truly looking forward to dinner here. We were on vacation in Chicago for a friends wedding so I searched our Groupon for a dinner deal, luckily this place was right around the corner from where we were staying so it worked out great. For $47 we got an appetizer, salad, two entrees and a dessert...alcohol was not included which was OK with us.  We arrived a little early hoping to have a drink at the bar, but there was no ""bar seating"" which was odd so they sat us right away at a table in the back (once they realized we had a  Groupon it felt as though they wanted to shovel us to the back, more casual part of the restaurant which made me a little unhappy). Our waiter came over and took our drink order, he suggested wine which turned out to be very good, he gave us the specials as well as some dishes that he preferred.and then went to retrieve out drinks (I think the waiters were their own bartenders too).  We started with the Grilled Calamari..we had this the night before at a different restaurant and it was to die for...unfortunately, it was not great here. The pieces were whole and looked like chicken tenders, they were slightly rubbery and pretty tasteless, we did not finish the plate. Next, we had the Caprese Salad ($10)...tomatoes and mozz ($10), basic, bland and tomatoes that were not overly fresh. The food was eatable but not worth full price yet. For dinner my husband ordered the Rabbit Ravioli ($25)which was my first choice. We had the idea that it would be decent chunks of meat in the ravioli..it was not. It wasn't even a ground meat consistency, it was more of a mushy pureed meat, not thrilling. I ordered the Lamb Chops ($30) which came with veggies and potato wedges. I also, was not impressed. The flavor was bland, they were slightly dry and the potatoes were too basic, the veggies were very good. For the price, we were not happy. For dessert we only have 3 choices because of the Groupon so we ordered the Bread Pudding which I don't prefer, but it was pretty good, with dessert my husband also ordered Grappa. Apparently they were out of it. They were also out of something to make the pumpkin martini the table next to us ordered. I have a feeling they are always ""out"" of this...it's on the menu but they don't really have it. That was a disappointment.  So the place was middle of the road. There are much better places to eat in Chicago, but for the price we paid for the Groupon this place was borderline worth it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, sorry.",0.974,0.809,0.118,0.073,0.563486073674753
2012-11-13,5.0,"First, for the price of the food, it was a well earned 5 star. We came here for a nice date night and saw Yelp offered at $15 for $30 deal. Bought it through my phone, and off we went, a short 5-10 minute walk to, what I thought, was a small Halsted eatery. We arrived around 6:00 PM. About a handful of tables were taken in what I thought was the whole restaurant. When the host asked where we wanted to be seated and I said the back, I did not expect to see that much hidden space available! Down side, chair room could be limited if you are the type to sit at the edge of your seat. They do try to put as many tables as they can in each nook and I can see why. By the time it hit 7:00PM, the line was out the door and it was jam packed. Bravo to us for great timing.  -Appetizer: Grilled calamari was perfectly cooked and the sauce it was in was delicious. Even though I try to stay away from the free hot from the oven bread they give you in the beginning so I don't get myself full from it, it happened. And it was all because of that darn sauce. I get picky with any seafood because I hate the toughness and over chewy texture it can be when over cooked. But this grilled calamari was phenomenal. A light chew but overall buttery taste.  -Con: The fried up version (I saw from the next table) portion looked bigger than ours. Maybe the breading of the fried calamari puffens up the look. But our cute plate of laid out squid looked minimal. But not a huge complaint that I wouldn't get it again, and the boyfriend agreed, we actually prefer it grilled. No matter the portion size.  -Main Course: I ordered the Linguini alle Vongole and he ordered the Spaghetti Barese Portions: HUGE. I mean, my boyfriend who eats for three couldn't finish. The veal meatball was so soft, you barley had to chew it. It was great!! I am not a fan of meatball, and can't stand the rough bumpy texture, but this was so smooth and BIG! The muscles in my pasta were delicious, the white wine sauce, I felt, was a little oily, but the generous amounts of garlic balanced it out for me!  -Con: Previously mentioned, white wine sauce was a little oily, but it was balanced out by the garlic so it neutralized it.  Verdit:: Would I come again. YES. Perfect for a girls night dinner. Four people, one appetizer and two pasta dishes should do the trick! I didn't get the check out their wine list, but I am sure it had a great variety. Also, checking in for a free cappuccino doesn't hurt. The place offered great deals, the food was great!

Used the $15 for $30 Yelp coupon with no problems. We ordered the Mussels w/ white wine sauce for an appetizer. We absolutely devoured this. Delicious and the broth had amazing flavor. She ordered the Zuppa di Pesce (spicy upon request) which was huge but had a generous amount of mussels, clams, shrimp, calamari, and salmon and PASTA. Delicious as well but she barely ate any of it because she was so full from the bread and appetizer. There was enough leftover to last a week. I ordered the Lobster Ravioli. The pink sauce was delicious and the lobster stuffing was flavorful as well. However, the ravioli was pretty carb-y and you had to chew it a lot which made me full real fast. If you're like us and like to share entrees, one person should get a carb dish and the other should get something like the braised lamb shank or the milk + honey baby back ribs or something that doesn't include much pasta. Otherwise, all the carbs and chewing will get you pretty full. With all this + the coupon our total came out to $60. Don't expect to pay less than $30 a person when coming here.

I got bucotini carbonara and as far as I can tell they've corrected whatever problem those reviewers had. The pasta was just at the end of al dente.

Their wine list bottoms out in the upper $20s, but if you really wanted a cheap wine with your dinner, you'd go to a BYOB place. Don't be fooled by whoever marked it two dollar signs, though.

2012-10-07,4.0,"Excellent Italian food!  Better than we can make at home (which is sadly not as common as we'd expect).   We visited on a Friday evening around 6:30 to use a Groupon we'd bought.  We were quickly seated in the back room, which was dimly lit and had LED candles on the tables.  The dining room was a bit loud, but not overwhelmingly so. The Groupon covered an appetizer, salad, two entrees, and a dessert.  We got the Crostini Di Avocado for our appetizer.  It was like guacamole on toast; pretty tasty, but nothing outstanding.  Our salad, the Insalata Stella, was quite good, especially with the pairing of raspberries and champagne vinaigrette. We ordered the Cappellacci di Zucca and the veggie lasagna for our entrees.  The first was outstanding, with well-roasted chunks of pumpkin sauteed in a buttery sage sauce.  The Cappellacci themselves were exquisite; large, well-stuffed, handmade pasta that perfectly matched the flavor of the pumpkin. The lasagna was a gigantic serving with a heavy emphasis on mushrooms.  The tomato sauce was excellent, but the dish did not quite measure up to the Cappellacci. We got the Tiramisu for dessert.  It was pretty average; creamy with a nice spongecake base, but not a lot of flavor. We're definitely planning a return trip, even without a Groupon.",0.9868,0.779,0.177,0.043,0.6924761904761906

And let me tell you there have been plenty of ""fine dining"" restaurants that have fallen flat in comparison to the food they serve here. I'm the kind that will shamelessly celebrate ""World Carb Marathon"" day... Yep, shamelessly addicted to pasta! Their menu features traditional Italian dishes that we've come to know and love in their best form. The basil is always fresh like it has just been plucked. The mozzarella in caprese is stretchy and salty in the most delicious way. The simple tomato and basil sauce is zingy and I would not misunderstand if someone feels like singing poetry after tasting it. The pasta stuffed with pumpkin in a browned butter and sage sauce is as delectable as it sounds. After all this, if you do have room for desert, try the classic tiramisu.

The pink cream sauce was definitely soaked up by bread! -Vitello Ossobuco alla pugliese- this veal just melted in my mouth! It was a little on the fatty side, but oh my goodness! Delicious! The lasagna was also quite good. -Panna Cotta- it was pretty good, very creamy -Prosseco- decent serving size. It came in a little bottle which was almost 2 glasses worth. Sweet, but not too sweet.

2012-09-25,3.0,"I've had an up-and-down history with Sapori over the years I've dined there. I loved the food on my first visit ~7 years ago, then became disenchanted with the food & ambiance (dim, crowded) on successive visits. Then I dined in the outdoor area and had a nice meal on a lovely summer evening. I keep coming back because of the location -- and because of Chef Anthony's clever personalized coupon mailers, I must admit. My recent visit was barely OK, definitely not a high point. We were seated indoors, in a dim, crowded, somewhat drafty back room. Our server was courteous, but not very warm. The food was just passable. I had rabbit ravioli, which tasted good, though the pasta was just a bit overcooked. My companion's spaghetti Barese had good flavors, but the pasta was overdone. I commented to the server about the pasta when he cleared the table, though I didn't expect any sort of compensation -- I just wanted to give the kitchen feedback. Then things got weird. Lo and behold, the server brought a complementary tiramisu for dessert, apologizing for the soggy pasta. A nice gesture, but tiramisu is the last thing I'd have ordered. It would have been more polished to ask what we would like as a complementary dessert, yes? The tiramisu was, though, pleasant enough. Then a busser brought the leftover pasta that I had complained about, packaged for us to take home. Amazing. I'm sure I'll be back at least once more (I have another coupon), and I'll hope I hit another high.

I'm not saying the food was bad, but when you pay $180 for dinner for two I want to be able to rave about it afterwards. When all things are considered we might as well just spent $40 at a cheaper place and saved our money. The pumpkin ravioli was tasty, but the meat lasagna tasted as if it were built hastily with rather poor ingredients.

And here's why....this place is top notch, authentic Italian. One location, kick ass menu, great staff and chef - I could go on and on, and I will for a bit. Honestly I've probably been here 10+ times this year. It's our Italian staple and when we go we always can count on amazing food, great ambiance and friendly attentive staff - ripe with suggestions and pairings. I'm a marketing professional and honestly I'm impressed by Saporia's ""outreach"" to their patrons. Once you dine with them, fill out a survey card and please for the love of god leave them your address. I know, it was counter intuitive for me too with my anti-spam mentality. It's NOT spam, it's worth it. They send $15 off cards several times a year, accompanied with a hand written note from the head chef himself. When you fill out the card you're also entered into their giveaways - they do special dining nights, give away bottles of wine etc.  Ok I'll stop blabbing on... here's the quick and dirty - Check out their reviews online @ yelp, reserve a table at Open Table for quick/easy night out - The seemingly small space goes on to a back room, floor above and romantic patio seating (during the summer) love those lights! - Apps: we typically go with the sautéed mussels in red sauce - super YUM: Cozze Scoppiate ($9.95)  On our last visit we tried an app on their specials - it was prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, toasted bread w/sun dried tomatoes (?) - it was so tasty and un-believable fresh. Perfect to get your pallet prepped for the meal ahead - The Main Event: o My go-to - Rigatoni Caprese ($18.95) - A very unique sauce of hand picked, lightly stewed tomatoes hand crushed and finished with a generous portion of fresh basil, select extra virgin olive oil and bocongini mozzarella. Honestly I don't remember the last time I veered from this choice, I know there's other amazing menu options but this dish checks all my boxes and I LOVE it. The portion sizes are large and I'm in left-over heaven! o My main-squeezes go-to - Spaghetti allo Scoglio ($21.95) - pasta sauteed in a marinara with mussels, clams, shrimp and scallops (spicy on request. Like fresh seafood + pasta, please try this. Plus you can request an extra kick! o Reco from the chef himself - if you're looking to really celebrate tonight try the Milk and Honey Baby Back Ribs ($27.95) Delicate grilled baby back ribs (pork) marinated in honey and thyme finished in a slow braise with fresh milk and a touch of citrus. Chef Anthony Barbanente told us that it took him 3 weeks to perfect this recipe and it's absolutely knock your socks off. We'll be coming back to check this out!

2012-07-11,4.0,"I was pretty happy to find this small Italian restaurant. I am rather picky about my pasta and how it is cook and the first time I was here i was not disappointed.  Food: The sauce was really well prepared. First time here I had the lobster raviolis, which were really well done. second time around I had this seafood pasta dish. The flavors were definitely there, but my pasta was way too over done. I believe this was due to the fact that it sat in the soupy base. But I wasn't too upset over it Environment: First time I was outside, although it was a bit warmer that day, i did enjoy it, 2nd time around, we were upstairs, which was alot warmer feeling environment. I actually really enjoyed it especially that day. Overall: The food here is good, the sauce is well made, the prices are decent, the service is good. This is definitely a place i would come back to.

I had already invited her to my birthday dinner on the actual day, but she wanted to treat me out again... Why wouldn't I say yes? I'm all for celebrating my birthday multiple times. Anyway, the reservation was made for 830pm. She had bought a Groupon and wanted to use it. I arrived earlier than she did, and I got seated right away. The room they seated us in was small, and I felt a little clusterphobic, but it was nice and intimate.  The Groupon was for a four-course meal, and we asked our server if we may substitute the salad for a second appetizer. He said it was fine. So for our appetizers, we ordered the cozze scoppiate--mussels sauteed in a red sauce--and bruschetta. Both were delicious. We also started with a glass of red, but I can't remember the name of it to tell you what it was.  For our entrees, we ordered the zuppa di pesce--Sapori's classic seafood linguini pasta in a light red sauce--and the vitello ossobuco alla pugliese--slow cooked veal shank in a rich red sauce atop a meat lasagna. The seafood pasta was delicious, but the show-stopper was the latter dish. The veal was so tender and juicy. We shared both entrees, and we both agreed that the latter was our favorite.  Then for our fourth course, we shared a tiramisu, as our server said that they have the best tiramisu in Chicago. I'm not a big fan of desserts in general so I don't know if it's the best in Chicago, but I agree that it was delicious. At the end of the meal, I filled out a comment card for the restaurant. Several weeks later, I received a hand-written thank-you card from the chef/owner with a $14.00 gift certificate (but I forgot to use it before the expiration date). Wow! That was completely unexpected. I'd love to visit again.",0.9979,0.762,0.224,0.014,0.41292517006802726

2012-06-28,3.0,"Overpriced and possibly overrated.  I may need to give this place another try, as what I ordered is one of the known most difficult dishes to cook perfectly...risotto. I bought a living social deal to this restaurant because I have been wanting to try it for over a year.  Now was my chance!  We sat outside and once our wobbly table was fixed, the ambiance was very nice.  I had a glass of the malbec which was pretty good.  The bread with olive oil at the table was nice to have while I waited for my friend that was running a minute late. I ordered the seasfood risotto.  I know this is difficult to make but with the great reviews and the hailing of Chef Anthony, I figured they could pull it off.  I was wrong.  Perhaps it was Chef Anthony's understudy working this night.  Anyway, the risotto was so undercooked it was nearly crunchy.  Highly disappointed.  All of the seafood except for the calamari was cooked well though.  The calamari was overcooked.  My friend ordered one of the pasta specials and the noodles were all stuck together on the dish.  So undercooked risotto and sticking noodles...two Italian cuisine no-no's.   Also, my friend and I were very awkwardly asked to move to another table as we were just finishing up our wine.  We noticed that the table next to us was being set up for a group and figured they needed our table.  We hadn't seen each other in a while and so we were just finishing up our conversation.  I knew the group wasn't there yet, so I figured we were ok.  The manager or owner or some guy came up to us and said ""I'm going to have to ask you to move to another table.""  Now, I understand completely that you have to turn over tables.  Believe me, I do.  However, the way it was handled made me very uncomfortable.  It was the way he approached us and how he said it that bothered me.  There are a million better ways to have gone about it.  Needless to say, we immediately stood up and left.  He saw this happen and offered us a bottle of wine at another table, but we declined.  We were getting ready to leave anyway.  There's no reason to rush me when I'm about to leave, especially when the group for the table is not even there yet and if you need me to move, then please explain the situation better and ask a little nicer.   I am hoping to come back and have properly cooked food and to be treated better because I have heard rave reviews of this restaurant.  It's too expensive to have poorly cooked noodles and undercooked risotto.   A memorable experience for all the wrong reasons.",0.9654,0.82,0.11,0.07,0.5916666666666668

2012-06-25,3.0,"I came here on a Saturday evening around 8:30 for dinner. This place is enormous - they have main seating, seating in the back, and outdoor seating. We started off with apps by splitting the grilled calamari, which I wasn't a big fan of. I don't think balsamic goes well with calamari, and it both looked and tasted strange. I've NEVER seen calamari that isn't sliced into rings, so I was taken aback by these odd, tube-like, chewy things on my plate. We also had the stella salad, which I approve of because it was fresh and featured some fruit. For my main, I ordered the zuppa de pesce, which came in a ridiculously large ceramic tub. By tub, I do mean tub because it was larger than my face. I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars, and I'm ultimately giving a 3.5 rounding down because I've been eating leftovers from this tub for the past two days and I'm starting to resent it because it's still not done (and I swear that I'm a big eater). Also, the mussels were kinda stinky and just not fresh.  My bf's vitello ossobuco was delicious though. I'm a huge fan of veal, unwillingly so because the idea of eating baby cows is sad so I never order it, but I guess I don't mind devouring it if someone else ordered it (and it's just so tasty). It was fork tender and came with some very tasty lasagna.  For dessert, we had the chocolate hazelnut panna cotta, which was super rich and resembled a molded pudding. I liked it, and it went well with the free coffee (which you can get from checking in on yelp!). Service was good initially, but became super slow at the end of the meal. It took forever to get our table cleared and to get our check, but they did keep my water glass full throughout the meal, so I guess the service averages out to good.

2012-05-21,5.0,"I walked in with a flat stomach and walked out with a food baby.  Appetizer: Crostini di Avocado - Enormous amount of fresh avocado accented with the perfect hint of citrus and cheese. Avocado fills you quicky though so this four piece appetizer is meant to be shared by 3+, assuming one of you 3 is an avocado die hard fan, like  me. Salad: Instala Stella - not much to it. Fresh leaves and drenched in vinegrette Entrees: Milk and honey baby back ribs - ""tender"" does not do it justice. As soon as it meets the warmth of your mouth it melts. Then the meat and the juice start hugging and dancing on your tongue. I don't enjoy beef as much as seafood but the texture and flavors of this dish are the best treatment of beef that I have ever tried. Zuppa di Pesce - humongous amount of food. Amazing scallops and mussels. The clams shrimps, salmon and calamari IMHO are a bit overcooked. I like clams and shrimps dressed in light(er) sauce. And I prefer raw salmon. The sauce in this dish is divine though. Ask for spicy. The subtle kick complements the dish very well. Dessert: Panna Cotta - please get it. I had no idea what suspended creme meant but I was sold on chocolate and hazelnut. The consistence is like a mixture of custard and flan. We couldn't finish it but every bite was an euphoric experience. Glad that we saved room for this dessert.  I am definitely coming back to try more on their menu.

Could've used a bit more lobster in the filling, instead of whatever the filler material was. My wife had the same thing, and she wasn't too crazy about it. Still, that said, I enjoyed its freshness and homemade-ness. Also had the Crostini di Avocado. Basically Italian guacamole on toast. Doesn't sound too special, but its very tasty.

We had a larger group so we were seated at a big ""family sized"" table in the back . . .not exactly private but enclosed enough to give you the illusion of privacy.  The warm Italian bread with the olive oil and Parmesan was quickly devoured while we sipped our drinks. We decided to try a range of appetizers- grilled calamari, fried calamari, rigatoni with bolognese sauce, crostini with avocado, and the burrata plate complete with sliced meats.  All were good but my favorite was the crostini with avocado. Next up?  A salad served family style.  I have no idea what was in this salad (maybe cheese, apples with some kind of a mustard dressing?) but whatever it was, it was a great starter course for us. And then the entrees came.  Holy cripes!  The serving sizes are huge!  The lasagna that one person had surely could be 4 servings, my sea bass could easily have served two and the lobster ravioli was enough that we could all share and still enjoy as an entree. And for dessert- the bread pudding or the tiramasu would both great bets! Nicki was our server and he was great! Plenty of suggestions for us and took care to make sure what we ordered came out at the right time. No request was out of bounds and he took care of us with a smile on his face for the entire time we were there, which, after the day I had had was much appreciated! Because Italian restaurants are plentiful in this city, I usually rate them by their bolognese sauce.  And while good here, it wasn't the best I have had in the city . . . .funny as I expected to be able to rave about it.  It tasted a little over cooked. Also- if you drive, you might be able to find parking on the street, or you can park for free in the Home Depot garage just south of the location.  Just remember to get your ticket validated at the restaurant. Good food, great service in a casual Trattoria style restaurant.  You may think you just stumbled onto a side street in Rome!",0.9984,0.759,0.22,0.022,0.5247551502870653
2012-05-07,4.0,"I was here on a date recently, and it was the perfect venue. The outside is very unassuming, with a worn out awning. Inside, it was cozy and warm.  We were greeted by our awesome waiter and were provided warm bread with olive oil and parmesan.  For appetizer we had the Crostini di Avocado. Creamy and delicous! A little too much olive oil, as I don't like the feeling of too much oil in my mouth, and avocados have oils of their own. But still delicious. I ordered the milk and honey ribs, which the waiter said he thought it was the best thing on the menu. My date ordered the mushroom risotto.  The ribs are fall off the bone. Flavorful sauce with rich bbq. The ribs sat on a bed of carrots that were julienned too long. It's awkward to pick up with the fork...doesn't stick like pasta so hard to twirl onto the fork. Then you get sauce all over your face because the end of the carrot string hit your chin as you try to shove the fork in your face...but I digress. Ribs, good. The sauce is on the salty side, so mashed potatoes or rice would've been a perfect accompaniment, but it only came with the cumbersome carrots. I tried the mushroom risotto. The mushrooms were definitely fresh and flavorful. Again, maybe a little more salty than I would've liked. But still good. I would've given this place 3 stars for the food based on the above...it was delicious, but not something that would make me crave it again and go back. Perhaps if I tried a pasta dish, it might've been different. Shrug. I gave 4 stars because the service was excellent. The waiter anticipated our every need. When my drink was down to it's last few sips, I already had a new one. He was very attentive.  Even more impressive, we had leftovers and he sealed it so well that it didn't make the car smell like food after seeing a movie!",0.992,0.82,0.148,0.032,0.5932910182910183

The $8.99 bruschetta was OK, nothing special to justify its costing double the one at Pasta Palazzo (which, btw, is a great place and the antithesis of Sapori in terms of value - really good food and quite inexpensive). The mushroom risotto was soupy and...how to put it...when I order a $20+ pasta dish I want it to have something exquisite about it. I have made better risotto myself, and I am no risotto expert. I vacillated on giving this place just one star but it's not flat out bad.

And I'm still struggling with whether to write a serious, superlative-filled rave or simply a string of guttural moans. Please know that it was a toss up. The food is unbelievable. Started with the fried calamari: perfectly breaded, perfectly crispy, and served with the best marinara sauce I've ever tasted. I'm not a big bread eater but I was quick to make my own ad hoc bruschetta with the leftover sauce.  Next we had the caprese salad: fresh, simple, and delicious. Amazing how 4 simple ingredients (mozzarella, tomato, basil, and olive oil) can marry so perfectly. Yes, this is a little over the top, but best basil I can remember tasting. The entrees were the crescendo: Baby Back ribs were falling off the bone tender. No idea why they even gave me a knife. Marinated in milk, honey, and thyme, this is one of the best things I've ever eaten. The rabbit ravioli, served in a burnt butter/wine/cream sauce was also superb. I realize that this sounds rich/heavy but in reality was subtle & delicate, and the flavor profile was the work of a genius. If I had to pick one of these to order again I'd go with both. The service was also warm and on point. Perfect spacing between dishes, never an empty wine glass.  The best meal I've had in a long time.

I got a black gnocchi seafood special and my gnocchi was undercooked, the sauce just tasted like salt and the seafood bits were few and far between.  The girlfriend ordered penne with sundried tomatoes, chicken and artichokes in a white sauce.  it was better than mine but still had salt as its main flavor. Considering the portion size, the prices were reasonable, but just piling on a ton of pasta doesn't really make something a good value in my mind and after having a glass of wine and dessert I wouldn't say that the bill was cheap.

2012-02-22,4.0,"Not like this place needs another review but that's never stopped me from adding my two cents. I've been here a few times and I like it more and more every time. The service is undeniably friendly, everyone from the host to the bussers to the servers are all welcoming and accommodating. And of course, the food is pretty spectacular too. Some menu highlights: Martini al fresco:- Effen cucumber vodka, fresh lime juice, St Germain, prosecco and garnished with fresh cucumber. I am a sucker for cucumber cocktails and this one had my name all over it. Deliciously refreshing. Calamari: I've tried both their fried and grilled versions and both are ridiculously good. I am a happy camper anytime I see grilled calamari on a menu since most places only offer fried. The grilled is lightly charred and smokey and the fried is tender, not greasy, and a squeeze of lemon is all it needs. I don't even bother with the marinara sauce it's served with; it simply doesn't need it. Avocado crostini: a great twist on standard bruschetta. Fresh, ripe, diced avocado with parmesan and provolone cheeses, chopped tomatoes, and a touch of citrus on crusty bread. So decadent and rich. Great starter to share when paired with the calamari. Risotto ai funghi: I didn't love the texture as it wasn't very creamy, but the flavor was good. To be fair, good risotto is quite hard to master, but I'd probably skip this in the future. Pastas: I've had the pumpkin ravioli, which comes with the classic components of brown butter sauce, sage, and pine nuts and it's pretty terrific. Last night I was in the mood for eggplant parmesan but was dismayed to not find it on the menu. Our adorable server, Benji, assured me it would be no problem for the kitchen to make it for me. I am so grateful they did, because it was fantastic. My friend ordered the vegetable lasagna and couldn't stop raving about it. Dessert: I'm generally too stuffed to order dessert so the only thing I've had is their lemon sorbetto, which is served in a frozen lemon shell. I love when places do that. As I mentioned before, the service is stellar. Menu recommendations are spot-on and they always aim to please. I often receive coupons in the mail that save money (usually it's in the form of a $14 gift certificate), and I welcome anytime I can save some dough. In my opinion prices for pasta dishes (without any protein) are a couple of dollars higher than they should be ($20 for eggplant parmesan and vegetable lasagna seems a little spendy), but the prices are offset by the plentiful discounts they frequently offer, so I guess it evens out. Parking in the area isn't too difficult on weeknights, but I'd imagine it's problematic on the weekends...but they now allow you to park for two hours in the Home Depot lot just down the block, so be sure and take advantage.",0.9985,0.708,0.226,0.066,0.6083678398895791

Making a reservation for a Friday night was simple and the restaurant was busy but not packed.  Our waiter was very polite and kind, not pushy.  I order the rigatoni caprese, and it was delicious.  I also tried the gnocchi which was very good too.  They have a nice wine list and serve fresh bread before the meal.  Everything was delicious but slightly overpriced.  I paid $20 for a pasta dish that probably should have only cost $15 in my opinion.  I will go back, and Sapori is definitely worth a visit.",0.9935,0.699,0.301,0.0,0.5753514739229024

It's nothing fancy inside, sort of unfinished floors by the front elevated platform and pretty basic. But the food was really, really good. Started with the avocado crostini and it was terriffic. The presentation on the caprese was great- though I shouldn't have ordered tomatoes in winter....just aren't great this time of year. Was impressed with the home made pastas and the portions were huge. They didn't skimp on the seafood in a pasta special I had...was loaded with shrimp, calamari, and other good stuff. They have a very decent wine list that includes a reserve and grand reserve list and everything is fairly priced.  It's not an elegant place like Spiaggia, Picolo Sogno, etc...but it's more your everyday Italian. I enthusiastically recommend the place!",0.988,0.741,0.233,0.026,0.5934047619047619

The service was friendly, attentive and professional from hostess to the waiters to the bus staff.  We never felt rushed and the pace of the meal and service was great. The menu is diverse, with lots to try.  The caesar salad was fresh and crisp, if not a little heavy on the fresh squeezed lemon.  Mussels in white wine were spot on.  The lobster ravioli was creamy and dually rich and light.  I got the Zuppa de Pesce, one of their house specials, which has enough seafood for two or three people with linguini in a lightly spicy sauce.  The tiramisu might be the best I've ever had, and I do not say that lightly. All of that, and the bartender makes a good Negroni?  I'll definitely be back.  It's not cheap, but absolutely reasonable.  Do for yourself.  Do it for date night.

2012-02-01,4.0,"Sapori Trattoria is ***In Mr. Burns (from The Simpson's) voice*** ""EHHHHHXCELLENT"" Can't believe I lived by this place for almost a year while I was in school and never visited. Glad my girl and I came here after a hard days work. We were seated just before the dinner crowd showed up, so that was a plus.  While they're a bit more expensive than I'd prefer, they deliver finely executed classical Italian cuisine. The atmospheres a little crowded, but I've been to a lot of Italian places like that. So i personally am not bothered by sitting close to other patrons. I like how deep the restaurant goes and the dark wood flooring and furniture. Their patio is open when weather permits, so that has to be a real treat. Especially if you can catch some live music.  Their antipasti's and insaltae's are simple, but done with attention and care. We had their Crostini Di Avocado and we shared their Insalata stella. The crostini was a great way to start, they finished it with a good quality olive oil that I would have robbed the chef at gunpoint for. The salata was fresh, but overall just OK. I would go with their Caprese or Caesar next time.  For entrees, you cant go wrong with any of their pasta or protein dishes. Especially anything with veal. I had the Vitello Ossobuco alla pugliese, this is simply a soul satisfying dish. My girlfriend had the Milk and Honey Baby Back Ribs and ordered a small portion of Rigatoni Bolognese. These were both as equally delicious as my veal.  A nice bottle of Cab complimented are meal perfectly. They have a beautiful Italian wine selection and very accommodating service to assist the non wine enthusiasts.  Tiramasu, duhhhhh...a must order.  Sapori Trattoria is great for a late date (go around 830-9), early dinner, or anytime for lunch.

I hate to be cliche but when the shoe fits: They really do treat you like a guest in their home. A very popular, hard to get into home, I admit, but once you're in, it's worth the wait.  This place has Date Night written all over it. Dim lighting, exposed brick, cozy atmosphere. Aside from the random TV in the bar (??), the vibe is pure intimacy.  Everything I've had has been incredible. Risotto. Gnocchi. Ravioli. Lasagna. You cannot go wrong. It's not the most inventive Italian dining you'll find in Chicago, but why mess with what works: Bold sauces, lots of cream and perfectly made pasta.  This is a pricey night out, especially if you add wine. I think the bottle list starts at $30 and go up (way up) from there.

I couldn't move my chair back, or I'd hit someone. When I stood up to leave the table, I had to squeeze by the table next to me. There is only one small aisle through the restaurant and if anyone is walking in it, you have to wait for them to go by in order to move. Made me a little claustrophobic. 2. Loud music. Is it so loud to drown out all the conversations of those around you? Doesn't work, you can still hear the guy seated a foot away from you talk about his house closing. 3. I think everyone was talking super loudly to compensate for the noise. It only made the problem worse. The food was not so good as to justify the price. A pasta dish with nothing special for $21? Not worth it. I had the pumpkin ravioli and they were good, but way too sweet for a dinner course. I could only eat 2 of the 5 they gave me and I took the rest home.

'Nona' will have to forgive me this time; I used to think she was the one who made the best meatballs in the world, but Sapori's are just to die for.

Of course, when you have my luck, you'll arrive to find out that you've come on the first Tuesday they've ever had to cancel it, due to too many reservations.  Luckily, the manager was awesome, moved us to a corner table, and let us order off the tapas menu.  With two requirements:  1) we understood that not all the items were available and 2) we didn't wave our tapas menus in the face of the other suckas, mocking them.  No problem there. At this point you might think, Jen keeping her mouth shut?!  Impossible.  Well, not when the food is this good.  Everything we ordered was delicious, from the Cappellacci di Zucca (my fave - order it and thank me later), to the Rigatoni Caprese, and the Milk and Honey Baby Back Ribs.  As Mr. Scott D. would say, they were the truth.  The Crostone Di Avocado is a must for any avocado lover, and the Chicken Tortelini and Veal Meat Balls were ridic.  And the Tiramisu freebie for all the confusion?  Perfect.  I so need to become a regular here.

I've been to Sapori a handful of times.  It's in our neighborhood, it's decent, the interior is cozy, and they send you $14 off when u spend $50 coupons, so there's an extra incentive. However, i've always found the food to be way too expensive for what it is...  Penne dish + some cheese and tomatoes for $20?  C'mahn.  Get serious.  Lasagnas and raviolis are pretty solid though and worth the price.  But with that said, my roommate and I went last night and the service / entire experience was so absurd that I will never set foot in that joint again.  First of all, it was a Wednesday night people.  Probably 30% of the tables were sat, and after we waited at the front for about 5 minutes to even be greeted, we had to wait another 15 to be seated while employees continued walking by us without acknowledging us or communicating at all.  Huh?  And of all the open tables in the place, when they finally showed us to our table, they seated us next to the bathroom with a sweet view of the kitchen.  Ambiance crushed. It was probably another 10-12 minutes until we saw a server who was cordial at first but still pretty frosty and pretty rushed.  She did bring out our wine asap, which I appreciated.  I had the grilled calamari (good but too much sauce/balsamic) and a Caesar salad (way way sub par), and my roommate had the lasagna, which was really good...  And the coconut sorbet for dessert which was delightful.  However, our server got more and more salty (rude) as the meal went on, which I couldn't understand.  Dirty looks, scoffing when we only ordered one dessert to split, acting rushed and stressed whenever she was at our table, etc.  So uncalled for.  I worked in F&B for years and there's never any reason to act like that.  She looked even more annoyed when she saw the $14 off coupon on our table and just walked over and snatched it off the table and ran it back to the register to tally our tab.  When she brought the bill back, she said nothing - not thank you, not  ""have a good night"" - not a peep.  Just sat it down and walked away.   Dear Sapori:  there are a jillion and twelve restaurants in Chicago.  Try to remember when people come to yours that of all those places, they chose you, and try to treat them with respect and warmth accordingly.  You are decent but you're not THAT great; you're not Spiaggia and you're not Pane Caldo, and you're sure as sh*t not good enough to act like that or allow people to have experiences like that and ever expect them to come back.  For the folks who do come back, easy on the 'tude and snobbery towards them next time.",0.9914,0.821,0.13,0.049,0.5037981859410431

My friend and I had reservations for 7:30, and we were seated immediately. Our server Jenn was very friendly and accommodating, and she gave us a number of recommendations. The menu has of course a splendid array of pastas, meat dishes and seafood, and there were about 8 daily specials available. We both ended up choosing pastas. I took advantage of the rare occasion to have Lobster-stuffed raviolis, and my friend chose a linguini pasta with rapini, and mixed seafood. I do not eat pasta out too often, but I would say these two items were definitely worth it. Nice large portions, too. Both dishes were bursting with flavor, served at a good temperature and of course, very filling. The dinner salads are a good size, too (which should keep one from eating too much pasta-right!). The dressing was light enough but just a bit too heavy on the balsamic vinegar for my taste. I loved the tongue shui of the shaved carrots, though. We shared a bread pudding dessert which was small in portion, and big, big on texture and flavors. Lot's of things going on there. Raspberry things. Chocolate things. And warm, mushy cinnamon/love things. The wine we had was fine. I didn't labor over the choices and am no aficionado, anyway. Mel and I both agreed that the atmosphere and the people here really make it what it is. Friendly and relaxed. Warm and inviting. Definitely a good date or group place. Great menu.

In today's economy I think it's all about the customer service, and a chef actually taking time to write a note is just awesome.  As for the actual restaurant, it was equally wonderful.  Again, don't know why I didn't comment at the time, because it was really, really great.  For some reason that I don't remember, possibly the fact that there was a longer than 15 minute wait, we got a free appetizer - bruschetta, a classic, but only good if all the ingredients are fresh, which they were this evening.  The ambiance was nice, it's a  fairly big space but divided into smaller rooms so the feel was intimate.  I read some other reviews and see that other people took home leftovers - I remember my entree being so delicious that I ate the whole thing!

Being on Halsted, I was a bit wary that the parking situation may not have been ideal, but we were able to find parking right away.  We arrived 30 minutes early, but were seated immediately.  The restaurant itself seems somewhat small, but there is an entire backroom with more seating.  It is very cozy and though it can be loud because of the people at the tables next to  you being in such close proximity, it screams of what it would be like at an Italian dinner...literally. Always being one to stay within my comfort zone, I finally decided to try something new this time around and ordered the risotto pescatore.  And it did not disappoint.  It was risotto with a rich cream sauce with scallops, shrimp, mussels, clams and calamari.  The risotto itself was soft on the inside and had a nice bite in the middle--perfect texture.  The seafood was cooked perfectly and gave the whole dish a really strong seafood taste.  If you don't like seafood, then this dish will not be for you, but if you do, then eat on, my friends! My dad, being somewhat picky, couldn't find anything that particularly piqued his interest and asked the server if the kitchen could do anything with eggplant (one of his many favorite vegetables).  The server came back and told him that the kitchen would be able to make him an eggplant parmesean dish, which was very nice of our server as well as the kitchen staff to make the dish, which was not even on the menu. Now, being my dad's birthday dinner, I wanted to do a small surprise and asked the server if they had any free desserts they could do for birthdays.  He said yes, and in my mind I pictured a dinky scoop of ice cream with a candle on top.  Lo and behold, he brings out a giant piece of tiramisu sitting on top of chocolate syrup with a lit candle.  It was definitely a nice surprise and though my dad was too full to finish the whole thing, my mom, my brother and I were right there to help him finish it.  It was by far the best tiramisu I've EVER had.  You know when you order tiramisu at some restaurants and it's got that hard crust on the outer edges because it's been sitting in the fridge for too long?  Not this one.  It's so soft, moist and the cream sitting on top is exactly that--creamy.  It's sweet but not too sweet and all around yummy goodness.

We hardly ever get the chance to go out to a lovely italian meal (they don't serve pasta at Taco Bell, y'all), so we dressed up and went on a date. After driving around for-ev-er we decided to just valet the car. Valet, being, they told us to park the car in the valet spot and leave it there. Uh, okay! No charge, no hassle, but kind of weird. It had just started being consistently warm in Chicago so we asked for an outside table. DON'T. EAT. OUTSIDE, guys. The tables are soooooo tiny and smooshed against each other. I could barely cross my legs with the tiny space I had to fit my body between the chair and the table. Luckily during our meal the people behind the both of us left so we got a bit of breathing room. Our deal was good for a shared appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert. We got the mussels to share and they were certainly delicious. For our entrees, he got the lobster ravioli, and me being the lil oinker I am bought the dish on the menu that includes every type of seafood ever. I believe it starts with a Z.  After mowwing down the bread and mussels I was already feeling full but then here comes a VAT of pasta and seafood. I didn't really realize (see: read) what was all in this dish. Its pasta, mussels, scallops, etc. etc. etc. all swimming in a thin red sauce. I sat for a while eating what seafood I could before I ultimately quit. Dustin's lobster ravioli was really great, by the way, and of regular human portions. The server was nice enough to let us box up a piece of tiramisu so take home. (I didn't care for the tiramisu...I was trying to pretend it was chocolate cake. Dustin inhaled it though).

2011-08-05,3.0,"In a decade that increasingly is dominated by deal creaters, finders and connectors, paying full price for anything these days makes you look like a loser.  Felt somewhat smart then, going into Sapori on a Monday night, when the deal of the day was a 4 course family style dinner option for 20 something a head. The restaurant wasn't exactly overflowing - insufficient or less than effective promotion? Or maybe deal snobs do exist!  Which had me wondering how Sapori would look on a non-deal day. The food was good, well part of the food at least - my favorites were the pesto gnocchi, rigatoni and tiramasu (one of the best I've had, and I don't even like it that much). The caprese, the butternut squash soup and the wines were mostly forgettable.  But definitely not the kind of mouth watering Italian that has you lining up at their door, and paying full price.  The ambiance is rather nice, the restaurant surprisingly spacious considering the neighborhood it is wedged in, validated discounted parking ( not free as their website suggests -watch out!) is a perk, but the service was excruciatingly slow.  Overall, even though I spent more that night than I expected to (these darn birthday dinners!), I do believe Sapori offers a great bang for your buck - so if you want to give the home kitchen a break on a Monday night, pay a visit to the Sapori kitchen!",0.9182,0.819,0.129,0.052,0.45123015873015876

Every waiter or waitress has complete knowledge of the entire menu, and always make great suggestions of entrees, wines and desserts. Maximum rate for the service. The ambient can get a little loud, but not excessively, just the regular for a restaurant. Other than that, it's a pleasant place in general. I had the opportunity to be on both: out or indoor tables, and one or another are very comfortable to stay as long as you want. They also got a great selection of wines, that matches perfectly each dish on the menu. And finally the food. From the bread to the desserts, I recommend every single dish in the Menu. Some of them are very special to me, like the meat lasagna (Lasagna Di Antonio) and the Gnocchi al Brivido - two specialties of the Chef. For dessert, I strongly recommend the Tiramisu and the Panna Cotta. I strongly recommend Sapori for anyone that asks me about Italian food.

I'm never a big fan of Italian food - in fact, I don't even like red sauce. Pasta? Puuhleeezzz - lo mein noodles' copy-cat!! But was I glad I gave this place a try. Because now I've found my favorite neighborhood Italian.  In my one visit, I was able to try 4 dishes (thanks to my friends who trust that I have great oral hygiene). They are:  - Risotto with mushroom: HEAVEN! Asian me like rice, so obviously i went with this option. The rice and mushroom were cook perfectly, not too soggy, and their flavor blends together so well. Definitely a must try,  - Gnocchi in Basil Pesto sauce: another gem. My friend got this and he kept eating my risotto and I kept eating this, to the point we almost exchange our plates. I have no be honest and say that the Pesto sauce was a bit too much for me in the end - regardless it was done very well with tender chicken and sun-dried tomatoes.  - Lobster Ravioli: I personally only had a small piece - but it was delish. My friend doesn't like seafood - yet she went with this option, and loved it! - Bolognese - my boring boyfriend got this. It was the standard Italian pasta - I wasn't crazy about it, but again I am not a red sauce fan. Their services were wonderful - the waiter was very nice and friendly, and so was the host. They don't have lots of space inside, so you might feel a bit too close to other tables at some point. But I think it made the place cozier.

I'm always down for Italian so I was pleased and was looking forward to trying a place I had never before patronized. The service was extremely accommodating. They even put us in our own little intimate room in the back. Sometimes restaurants can get very loud, making it difficult to converse, but the noise level at Sapori was totally acceptable. It's not often that we all get together, so it's important that we can all hear what the other is saying. The food was great. I thought it was a little on the pricey side (most of their dishes are over $20), but they did have a nice variety. There were a few things I was deciding between. The pumpkin ravioli and lobster ravioli sounded phenomenal, but I was really in the mood for the gnocchi. It came with a pesto sauce, and it was quite good. I wished the pesto sauce would have been a bit creamier, but other than that, I was happy with my choice. They also give a nice portion, so while you are paying at least $20, that will be enough for dinner and lunch the next day. They had a fabulous wine list, bread straight out of the oven, and a number of tantalizing desserts. We ordered the panacotta, which was my favorite dessert, as well as the tiramisu, also good, and the bread pudding, which I did not try.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about was my caesar salad. It just wasn't exciting. The dressing was just OK and the lettuce did not look fresh. Boo. Other than that, this was a fabulous pick.

The waitstaff is fantastic, the ambiance is perfect, but most importantly the food is just amazing. If you have any exposure to authentic Italian Cuisine, you will instantly feel at home with the flavor of the sauce, preperation and overall combination of the flavors. The resturant itself is small and intimate, with exposed brick and small tables with white cloth over them.

Fortunately, Sapori greatly exceeded our expectations!  We had a bit of a rough beginning because we were not seated until a half hour after our reservation time. This was understandable since they were slammed with all of the Groupon customers. The host was very apologetic and thanked us for our patience.

Seeing the mass quantity of positive Yelp! reviews, along with the recommendation by close friends, I am leaning toward blaming myself for a poor order here (which leads to my negative review.  I ordered the fish special--which was seared tuna.  Apparently I should have ordered pasta.  The first thing that turned me off on the dish was the ugly gray color, paired with the pale yellow potatoes--it was not visually appealing, to say the least.  I still ate the fish, which was OK, but it left me longing for a LOT more.  My girlfriend ordered the pesto gnocchi, which she liked, but we both agreed that it needed more--is it too ""American"" of me to say that it needed some type of creamy sauce on it??  The table next to us ordered some delicious looking pasta dishes, which I was lusting after my entire meal. The one GREAT part of our meal was the asparagus salad that we split.  It was mixed greens with cooked asparagus, cherry tomatoes and goat cheese with lemon.  If you are looking for a light appetizer, I'd HIGHLY recommend this dish. While I'm sure that Sapori typically serves up some great food, maybe it just wasn't the ""special"" place I had in mind for that night.",0.9859,0.791,0.158,0.051,0.508517797017797

We started with the Bruschetta, the Crostini di Avocado, and the Calamari Fritti.  The Crostini was amazing!  The other appetizers were also tasty but the avocado was just spot on. We then had Cesare salad and their specialty salad, the Insalata Stella.  Both were excellent but the Stella was a great combination of flavors with the raspberries, apples, provolone cheese and honey mustard.  Definitely recommend! Then our main course.  We had the Rigatoni Caprese which was excellent and the only thing I can find actually on the website menu.  The sauce was very simple but so fresh tasting!  We also had a lemon asparagus risotto which was nice and creamy.  Our third entree was this chicken stuffed with spinach and cheese (mozzerella?) and topped with a sun-dried tomato & mushroom sauce.  The restaurant claimed this was the Chef's special dish and it was delicious!  Served with potatoes. I have to admit that at this point my stomach was starting to stage a revolt.  But I powered through enough to at least try the desserts.  And I'm glad I risked it! Chocolate cake with raspberry sauce - delicious!  Tiramisu - nice and creamy and chocolaty and pudding-y.  Just what Tiramisu should be! BUT, my favorite by far was the bread pudding.  If I'd had any room left I would have focused solely on this dessert.  Warm and delicious with the scent and flavor of vanilla topped with a raspberry sauce.  It was wonderful! Server was great, attentive without being pushy.  Ambiance was nice, I loved the exposed brick and the candles.  We had our own little room which was perfect for us!

I originally came to Sapori a few months ago for a Yelp elite event and the appetizers at the event were so out-of-this-world amazing that I knew I had to come back for dinner. Thanks Yelp for introducing me to this restaurant. My friend and I both ordered the braised lamb shank (with fresh seasonal vegetables, roasted red peppers)--it was so tender and flavorful, the meat just fell off the bone--best lamb shank I've had anywhere hands down! We also got the Cappellacci di Zucca to share as an appetizer (pasta stuffed with pumpkin in a burnt butter sauce with butternut squash, sage and pinenuts)--amazing, heavenly, melts in your mouth, tastes like you're eating a whole stick of butter--delicious! Excellent selection of wines, we ordered a fantastic bottle of Sangiovese. The tiramisu was classic and a great way to end the meal. Setting is cozy, comfortable, intimate. Service is friendly and attentive, they treat you like family.  There are so many other things on their menu that I want to try like the pasta stuffed with lobster, seafood risotto, milk and honey ribs, etc (I could list the whole menu). Their ""Family Style Monday"" night special is a steal! The prix fixe menu includes 2 appetizers, 2 soup/salad, 3 entrees & dessert for $20.95 (some items excluded).

Now that I see all these amazing deals they have on weekdays and other coupons, etc., I'm realizing we probably would have liked it more if we had had some sort of deal/coupon. That's  because the main issue I had with the food was that, while it was definitely pretty good, most of it was way over-priced. Even the basic pasta dishes started at around 19.99! I had the fish special of the day and while it was definitely tasty, it wasn't very different from something I can make at home-and it was almost 30 bucks. So, my advice would be--make sure you get a good coupon before you go!  I do have to add though that if it was just based on service, I would give 5 stars.

Now on to the food, which is high quality Italian fare.  The bruschetta was very good, as was the buffalo mozzerella bruschetta, which was a special that night.  And even though I usually don't order pasta or chicken while out to eat, I had the Pennette Cardinale, which had both.  The light tomato cream sauce was amazing and not too heavy.  The artichokes added great flavor as well.  My husband had the Zuppa di Pesce (spicy upon request) and was a big fan.  Portions were sizable.  The wine list had good variety with several great reasonably priced options.

We were going to start out with one of the appetizer specials, an artichoke stuffed with parmesan and bread crumbs.  Our server must have forgotten to put the order in so we never got it, which ended up being a good thing, although I still want to try it.  We ordered the lasagna and a shrimp and broccoli pasta from the specials that night. First of all, that lasagna could have fed a family of four and was exactly what I wanted.  Perfectly delicious combination of meat, cheese and sauce.  Yum.  Secondly, that shrimp and broccoli pasta with white wine butter sauce was ridiculous.  Really, so good that I couldn't stop eating it. I polished off 1/2 of the lasagna and started in on the shrimp pasta.  I'm pretty sure I looked like a crazy woman as I was guarding both plates like a teenage boy at Thanksgiving when the server came by to clear.  I had to eventually cut myself off, but we ended up with some tasty leftovers to take home.

I wanted something more sophisticated than you're local Italian joint, but not something that would break the bank.

We ordered the grilled calamari appetizer and the linguine and shrimp with broccoli cream sauce. I wanted to love the calamari appetizer. The balsamic sauce was fantastic and worked really well with the smoky flavor of the grilled calamari. However, I felt that the individual pieces of the calamari were hit and miss. When the squid was tender, it worked perfectly. When the squid was gummy, I felt a bit cheated. I really don't expect squid to taste gummy at a place this nice. The linguine and shrimp was quite good, although the quality of the shrimp was not as high as I would have expected. That said, the dish worked together very well. Maybe this is just an issue with their seafood, and I'd have to try some other items on the menu to confirm.

A quick confession - I stay away from anything ""pumpkin"" with a passion.....none of that pumpkin latte and pumpkin pie stuff for me (peach pies are the way to go!) but I decided 2011 should be about adventure and excitement and so I take a huge leap of faith and try the ""pumpkin ravioli with a butter sage sauce""....and good heavens it was simply delicious!!! I mean had I been so wrong all these years? Had I judged pumpkin too soon? I'm still trying to resolve those issues...but in the mean time go check out this place!  I refrain from a 5 star rating: only because the gnocchi could have been a little better. I know I have had better. The prices are a bit steep for the quantity. I get the fresh food, gourmet meals concept and all...but a little extra quantity for the price would be nice!  Overall a very pleasent experience, friendly staff, dim lit, romantic ambience, excellent wine selection -that seems to be close to everything that I would expect from a good neighborhood Italian restaraunt!",0.996,0.734,0.245,0.021,0.5953703703703704

I ordered the grilled calimari, mussels in white sauce, and the milk and honey ribs.  All were awesome!  My girlfriend ordered the caprese salad and the bass filet and those were great too..

I had a reservation for 8pm.  I was addressed at the front, and asked to wait 10 minutes.  I am laid back, so I was fine with waiting a few.  Plus, it was PACKED, which only increased my confidence.  After about 15 minutes of waiting, the host (I think he may have been the owner?) handed me the wine list and asked me to pick out a glass of wine on him to appease me for the wait.  It was a very nice personal touch.  I was already in love! The great customer service didn't stop there.  My server was friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt.  And the food?  The mussels in white sauce were huge, succulent, and probably the best I have ever had.  The Insalata Stella was also delicious.  I had the Pumpkin Ravioli, and it was divine.  Such a unique flavor combination, but soooo good! It was also a HUGE portion.  I cannot wait to tell more people about how awesome this place is.  It is also easy to find coupons and they have specials, making it a more reasonable price.

Next day when I was having the left over, it tasted even better :). Lobster Ravioli: It is named as something else, but I do not remember the name. The sauce was excellent! Tiramisu: It was ok.

As for the desserts, always my favorite part, they were tasty and were not at all overwhelming as some Americanized Italian desserts can be.

When I went, it was with friends, but frankly, this is a great place to just KILL IT on a date. Eschewing the rubbery pasta and overload of marinara that has sadly become the state of Italian these days, Sapori instead chases new flavors that I'd never seen in an italian restaurant, for instance, Pumpkin ravioli (Cappellacci di Zucca). Absolutely delicious, and a taste completely out of left field. Their grilled calamari with roasted red pepper and balsamic looks almost like grilled BBQ chicken! So good! Crusted bread with tomatoes, avocado, and provolone cheese rounds out a crisp, delicious appetizer. Spaghetti Barese features delicious noodles, a rich red sauce, and veal sausages. Fantastic. Their desserts are rich without being heavy, I sampled their Bread pudding, Panna Cotta, and Tiramasu, and loved them all. The service was prompt, but relaxed, ensuring an enjoyable meal for all.

Service from beginning to end was impeccable. We sat in the back room and next to a door. My mother felt a draft and the server put clear packing tape over the door and frame. Above and beyond if you ask me. My sister and I pretty much picked the menu but made modifications to some of the dishes. My father is allergic to sea scallops so we were able to eliminate it from one pasta dish. Our menu:  Crostina Di Avocado  Calamari Griglia  Minestrone Soup  Insalata Stella  Bass  Spaghetti allo Scoglio  Pennette Cardinale  Chocolate Panna Cotta  Everything was delicious. The food was portioned appropriately but we had leftovers. Timing I believe is crucial with family style dining and Sapori Trattoria nailed it. There was enough time between meals so we had time to sit back and enjoy what was just served.  In the end, the meal including two bottles of wine and coffee came out to be very reasonable. My sister and I split the bill and I have to say that I thought it would be more.

So everyone is smooshed on top of each other by the door. I didn't mind the wait too much- maybe 15 minutes. But I did't enjoy the standing area- it wasn't even productive for fun people watching. Sigh. The restaurant is cute, very nice ambiance and actually romantic w/little twinkle lights. Service was good. However, the food was not.  We shared grilled calamari for an appetizer. It was done right and not bad by any means but it didn't have that much flavor to it. I think it had a balsamic reduction sauce, which I was excited about, but it wasn't tangy or tasty. It was blah. Bummer.  So I eagerly awaited the entree, and it didn't arrive for a very long time. And when it did, it was just blah. It was spagetti w/clams, musels and shrimp. The seafood portion was great, however, the marinara sauce was not that great and the thing I coudln't get over was that the pasta tasted like ramen noodles!

Decent food with some clear hits and misses:  the pumpkin and squash ravioli was great - burned sage butter sauce or something or another on it was fantastic.  lobster ravioli - eh, pinkish, not very flavorful  panna cotta - HOLD UP!! Damn! So good and creamy and chocolate - one of those way more fat than sugar desserts, just the way I like it.  mushroom risotto - kinda odd - ridiculously huge portion, but I thought it was only mediocre with pieces of kind of crunchy/undercooked rice, even though my sister was loving it so that vote was split.  the milk and honey ribs were extremely moist and tender  Service was for the most part invisible in a good way, like non-obtrusive, but we did have to flag someone down to pay the bill in the end. And I like that they participate in a bartering program with other owners of small businesses/barters/etc. They graciously put our group of 9 in the separate little side room for our small party with no other people in it, which was a saving grace in an otherwise cramped space - especially since we were dining with a squirmy toddler. I would definitely recommend using that space for any small dinner parties/reservations, because it is off the main floor and is available for no extra charge.

My mom had a pasta dish with lots of seafood.  The seafood, again, was good, but I wasn't crazy about the sauce.  It didn't have the flavour explosion of the lobster ravioli, for sure.  Her dish was huge--she only ate about half, whereas I finished my ravioli easily.

GREAT way to start off the night! For my food  I had the calamari and it was warm, not salty or greasy but just perfect! and my entree was the lobster ravioli. Even though there was only 5 pieces, the size was pretty good and once I had a bite, I couldn't stop eating. I almost didn't want to share with my boyfriend! (Mean, right?) He had the lasagna but I wasn't a huge fan, the ravioli kicked butt. Towards the end, the server brought out the birthday cake that my friends brought beforehand and started singing happy birthday. It was a great way to end the night at a fantastic restaurant. I really recommend this restaurant to everyone, it is a very cozy restaurant with great workers and delicious food.",0.9974,0.641,0.322,0.037,0.7658068783068783

Unfortunately I'm only in town for a night and I really could have done better.  Ambiance: Cozy space with a lot of potential. Seems perfectly suited for a large party with plenty of room in the back. Staff seemed very attentive to the regulars and large groups who came through. Appetizer: The bread and Parmesan they bring out is mediocre. Won't  spend time beating that up, just bleh. I ordered a Caprese salad which was plated beautifully, taste was average. Served with now balsamic, just oil and pepper. 2 stars Main Course: Asked for the chef's recommendation for the main course. The waiter laughed and said, ""So you mean my recommendation?"" He threw out the spaghetti and meatballs or the honey and milk short ribs. The ribs tickled my curiosity so I went with that. The meat was well cooked, very tender not over done. Flavor was everything someone should expect from milk, honey, and meat I guess. Didn't really do anything for me. Not bad, but not a 4. 3 Stars. To be fair I saw some other patron's dishes coming out and had a few ""Ohh whats that moments."" Unfortunately I just seemed to be out of sync with what a lot of you Yelpers have experienced thus far.    Dessert: The dessert was far and away this meals saving grace. I went with the tiramisu and wasn't disappointed. It was out of this world. The waiter mentioned it is homemade every day in the restaurant. 5 Stars. Wine: I had the house red throughout the meal with a port for dessert and was pretty satisfied. 4 Stars. So long and short, I was expecting a once year kind of experience and was sad to say it was very average. Would I give them another shot? Eh. Ok.",0.9722,0.855,0.111,0.033,0.588047052154195

First of all, the table they had set up for us had personalized menus that said ""Sapori Trattoria wishes Lisa a Happy Birthday!""..... I absolutely ate this up. I will absolutely remember this if I ever need to book another occasion; they know how to accommodate. The service for a party of 14 was excellent; everything came out of the kitchen like clockwork.

Our table wasn't quite ready when we arrived so we stood by the tiny bar and ordered two glasses of wine. They have a VERY small wine list for glasses but many selections for bottles. The wine by the glass was just okay. The oil and cheese and bread awesome - great quality. Some Italian restaurants don't invest in good oil and cheese. We ordered the fried calamari. The took about 30 minutes to come out! The table behind us ordered mussels after us and were done with their app before ours even came out. A little disappointing. Then our entrees came out - I had the pesto gnocchi and my fiancé had one of the chicken dishes with fresh mozzarella and it was honestly just okay.

2010-09-14,5.0,"The Crostini Di Avocado is the best thing on the menu!  A friend and I decided to stop by on Monday night for the $20.95 four course family style dinner.  There was SO MUCH food I recommend having a party of at least 3 or more, for two people it was so hard to eat everything (but I did).  I also took the wine suggestion from the  server, I was going to order a Zin from the list of suggested wines (not the full wine list) and she suggested another one that was the same price but she liked better. I am kicking myself for not remembering the name but her suggestion was perfect.  She let me try both and her's really was the better choice. Food: They bring you bread to your table to dip into the olive oil and Parmesan cheese and it was so hard to eat only one piece but I knew I had so much more food coming. We ordered the Crostini Di Avocado, and I never thought to put avocado basically on a bruschetta but it was delicious. I liked that it had the cheese mixed in and the olive oil was a nice compliment to the avocado.  We also had the bruschetta and it was piled high with tomatoes and had plenty of olive oil too.  We then had the Butternut Squash Soup and cesar salad.  I am not huge fan of squash but there was something interesting going there with a mix of the sweet squash and then a more salty soup base.  The cesar was good too, I swear there were anchovies in the dressing (which is something I prefer) so 2nd course down. Entrees: Since we had to order three and there was only two of us we decided to get one dish we both wanted to try then the third was something we randomly picked.  My friend ordered the Spaghetti Barese which came with veal meatballs and Italian sausage. The meatballs were some of the best I ever have eaten and I don't normally order a standard spaghetti when I go out.  I had the Risotto Pescatore with the seafood and I haven't had risotto like this in 4 years. I remember the exact last time I had a risotto as rich and creamy as this and it has taking me a long time to find another that I love just as much.  Our third was, Bass alla Piccata which was a nice compliment to our other heavy dishes. The bass was light and and flaky and the veggies that came with it were fresh and crunchy. By this time I was ready to be rolled out of there and tempted to ask the CFD if they would drive me home but we still had dessert. We had the pana cotta and I realized I have never eaten it before. I could only handle a few bites but the texture was somewhere between a mousse and pudding and ice cream. My friend ate every bite and wanted to lick the plate clean. I am definitely going to make this my go to restaurant when I am in the mood for some comfort Italian. I thought we had to bring the coupon in but they were offering the special to everyone who came in. I also want to try the Wednesday three course dinner. This is a nice way to try the menu.   I also have to say their customer service was great.

I give the service 4 stars. The host stand is a crazy place to be and the guy who answered my call at 7:45pm on a Saturday night was not ready to handle all the calls and seating people. Calling at that time requires patience on the callers part, which I had, but after putting me on hold numerous times and not remembering my question a couple times, I was ready to just hang up and go there and try my luck on getting a table.  The rest of the service (our waiter and the manager on the floor) was excellent. We had a major dilemma with the food we ordered because I have food allergies - and it was really my fault for not double checking that the meal I ordered was gluten-free. So when the food came I realized the fish was lightly breaded - which wasn't going to work at all for me. Our waiter and manager took all the blame despite me saying it wasn't their fault - and they dealt with the situation very well. They went out of their way to make sure I had a meal I could eat and they barely charged us for anything. And topped off the wine for free because of the wait. The wait for our food was really long - but we weren't that hungry and weren't in a hurry so we didn't care. I can see how it would be annoying if we had some place to go though. And of course I had to wait longer for my gluten-free meal, but I didn't hold that against them. The food was okay. Our avocado 'bruschetta style' appetizer was super yummy (even without the bread part, which was how I had to eat it). My boyfriend ordered the bass meal - which was okay but nothing great. The cooks made a special gluten free version of the seafood risotta for me - which was very nice of them - but wasn't the best tasting meal.

2010-08-17,4.0,"I found this restaraunt on Yelp and decided to give it a try and found it to be well deserving of its reviews.  It was a Monday night, so we ate off the family night menu.  With the family night special, a glass of wine each, and the tip, it ended up costing us roughly $75 for the two of us.   The bread came out right away was delicious.  Always a plus when the bread is warm, right out of the oven. Appetizers: - The Bruschetta was good, but nothing more memorable than any other italian restaraunt - The Avocado Crostini was not only amazing, but a great change in what you usually see.  I would definitely recommend this appetizer to everyone Soup/Salad; - The Caprese Salad was light and fresh an ranked up there wth some of the better ones I've had.  The presentation, seen in th pictures, just adds that much more to it. - The Butternut Squash Soup was great for me, but a little on the sweeter side.  Definitely not for someone who doesn't like brown sugar flavor, but I loved it. Entrees: - Chicken & Gnochhi w/ pesto, Rigattoni Caprese, and Pumpkin Stuffed Noodles were all fantastic.  If the rest of their food is this good, I look forward to returning on another monday night. Desert: - This was where my only complaint came in.  Their desert option were very limited on the family night.  We ended up ordering bread pudding, but I just think I am not a huge fan of bread pudding, so I don't want to pass judgement on it.  Just not the right desert for me. In the end, table service was great (my water never went empty & more bread was offered immediately), the hosts were friendly, and while eating outside you still felt secluded from the streets.  I would highly recommend this restaraunt and can't wait to go back.",0.9928,0.749,0.185,0.065,0.5794821428571428

The first thing I noticed was there menu, which is very classic and authentic.  This is not to say uninteresting: everything is quite nice and there are many inventive items as well, just nothing that in my opinion ""tries too hard.""  It is one of the few places I have found so far that reminds me of the N. End in Boston. The wine list is ok, not great.  It serves up a reasonably varied amount of Italian wines from different regions (which in my experience is very rare in Chicago), and a couple classic American favorites as well.  Most importantly, the markup on bottles is really low, overall wine prices are great. On to the food! We ordered fried Calamari, and I chose the Zuppa di Pesce.  Also ordered were the lobster ravioli and pumpkin ravioli.  All of them were wonderful, and for 30 wing-wangs the ginormous Z.d.P was an easy 4 meals-worth!  Every kind of seafood imaginable and salmon served over linguine in a light, spicy red sauce. Overall the food was great.  The scallops were a touch over cooked for my liking, and the fried calamari, while delicious, was a bit plain. Service was beyond great...and they even let us order dessert and digestivo after they had closed.

We shared entrees: rigatoni with freshly crushed tomatoes, basil, and mozzerella.  So simple and yet incredibly delicious and elegant.   The other shared dish were their ribs.  If you are expecting bbq or asian style, you will be disappointed, as these fall off the bone babies are more savory than sweet....something you'd expect to find in northern Italy.  Needless to say, not an ounce of meat was left on the plate.

I would say never do this for 99% for restaurants out there, but sign up for their mailing list.  The discounts they mail you are actually worth receiving (like 25% off your entire meal or even free meals.)  Also, the chef here does a good job of making the emails seem personal and not mass marketing, (even though they are clearly mass mailing.)",0.9889,0.81,0.183,0.007,0.4156037414965986

From the beginning to the end of our dining experience I can understand why.  Lovely and welcoming atmosphere. I was surprised at how quiet it was, even as the back dining room we were in began to fill up. Very easy to have a conversation you can actually hear--big plus for me. Our server was great and a favorite of our friends. As such, he knew exactly who they were and what they liked. What really impressed me, though, was the friendly presence of Chef Anthony in the dining rooms. He took an active interest in greeting fellow diners and was introduced to us when he came to visit with our friends.  Started with the Crostini Di Avocado and Polenta Fries. While I'm not an avocado fan, it was still an interesting variation. The Polenta Fries were great--wide sticks that were perfectly fried and an aioli that complimented them perfectly. The Gamberoni e Broccoli was my entree, but I really wish I had ordered something else, instead. The serving was massive and loaded with chopped shrimp and vegetables throughout and topped with two of the largest shrimp I've ever seen. Unfortunately, I found the shrimp flavor to be too overwhelming. My boyfriend ordered the Lasagna Vegetariana which was also generously portioned. Turns out we actually should've just switched entrees because we preferred the other. We were too stuffed to order dessert, but our server brought out a plate of tiramisu and bread pudding on the house. Both were delicious, but I just couldn't stop eating the bread pudding even though I typically avoid the stuff. The combination of warm vanilla brandy sauce, sweet raspberry sauce, and fresh bread flavors was addicting. I would definitely go back to try some other dishes.

Food: Very Good.  Everyone liked their chosen dish.  I had Risotto Pescatore - scrumptious!  The half I took home even reheated well.  We got bruschetta (OK), fried calamari (tasty), and grilled calamari (not my thing, but still pretty good).  Dessert-wise, everything was yummy (chocolate hazelnut pennacotta was my favorite), but also a little too sweet.  Portions were HUGE for entrees and dessert, and there's no way I would've wanted half of a dessert, let alone a whole one, on my own. Space: Very Good.  I liked the decor.  It really did feel like the fancier restaurants I went to in Florence.  The dark wood, the dim lighting, the weird floor plan (mini room in the back), all made it seem very old-world.

I would not sit in the small room off the main dining room with the little window.

Maybe the dressing on the salad interacted with the aluminum take-home container; maybe someone use a contaminated utensil when transferring the food to the container. I live near the restaurant, and the food went straight into the fridge when we got back--and none of it contained meat--so it wasn't my fault. The cannoli and salad were all I ate the next night, and before I finished the cannoli I started to feel sick, and I wasn't back up to speed for nearly 2 days afterward. Worst food poisoning I've had in many years. I haven't been able to eat homemade pasta since, and though I'm willing to eventually give Sapori another shot, it will be a while yet. My birthday was back in February, and another birthday may pass before I can give them another try.",-0.2598,0.832,0.086,0.082,0.5018907563025211
2010-05-20,4.0,"I have lived within walking distance of this gem for a whole year, and just recently discovered it's deliciousness!   Lucky enough to get in last minute on a Friday evening, our party was promptly greeted by multiple staff members and escorted to our high rise table next to the bar.  As one should, the first thing I noticed was the atmosphere;  perfect for a romantic night out or a casual dinner with friends.  Exposed brick walls, tame lighting (dim enough to get away with having a booger up your nose, but bright enough to see the menu), and tasteful local art.  Plus, a great deal of their tables are cozy and confined while still amidst all the hubbub.  We got a table against the wall and directly in front of the door, but there was a properly placed barrier blocking the draft/view/crowd. The waitress arrived, and MAN I wish I could remember her name because she was the best.  Service was topnotch!  She promptly suggested some good vino to start, as we waited for our avocado bruschetta...WOW.  This was the creme-de-la-fucking-creme of bruschettas.  It's actually ""Crostini Di Avocado"", but let's not argue semantics. I'd get fat off this daily.  Truly a treat.   Then came our entrees. I wanted the risotto with all the yummy seafood (we're talking shrimp, clams, mussels, salmon, AND scallops) but none of the rice.  Our waitress said that'd be no problem, and offered to replace the rice with sauteed veggies (zucchini, bell peppers, onions, etc.).  Hmmm, really?!  Yes please, DUH!  The portion was gigantic, and the seafood was perfecto!  However, it was pretty damn salty.  All the right flavors, but I left with swollen fingers and bags under my eyes.  One of my companions opted for the Risotto ai Funghi, which was perfectly cooked but almost too mushroomy.  The other got the Spaghetti allo Scoglio (same as mine, with spaghetti).   Despite the slight imbalances in some of the entrees I would, without a doubt, order them all again.  They were still very yummy, substantial (!!!), and delectable!  It's pretty pricey, but you'll most likely leave with leftovers to nosh on for dayyyyyyyys.  The whole experience was wonderful, and I will be sure to put this on my ""go-to"" list!",0.998,0.73,0.23,0.041,0.4737603930461074

Also, their pastas are all homemade and you can tell. I never thought I would be able to but there is something definitely special about their pastas. Their desserts are also out of this world. The waiter told us it was the best tiramisu in Chicago and I frankly would not be surprised if it were. I've also had the chocolate raspberry ganache cake - winner! I would absolutely have given this place 5 or 5+ stars if possible except that the second time I came here, the service was absolutely horrendous :( It was just me and a classmate late in the evening and the place wasn't terribly busy. We placed our orders and started chatting, only to realize over an hour later that our pasta hadn't come out yet and we were starving. No one came by to apologize or explain the wait! But when we listened around everyone else was getting explanations and free drinks while they waited. Our food finally came out and there were some sheepish mumblings about the kitchen having some trouble and an off-comment about how dessert would be on them if we wanted.

I must say the food quality of Sapori was a solid ""A""... esspecially for the price.  The Milk and Honey ribs are not exactly the best in Chicago, but they are unique in flavor, texture, and garnish (there were carrot strings served with the ribs).  Unfortunatley the restaurant had run out of our first three menu selections.  Part of me wants to think that due to my history of good fortunes on Tuesdays throughout my life the restaurant may have helped me avoid finding out about a food allergy the hard way or some other opposit-of-ironic happening.  However, I don't think that my craving to try the dishes that were unavailable the night I dined at Sapori will bring me back very soon.   Some of the other downers of the experience were that the outdoor table I requested at the point of reservation was not available and the arrival experience was less than dramatic.  Things seemed a bit disorganized before we were seated.

We ordered our entrees and he asked us if we'd like to have soup or salad and we told him: salad. When the bill came, he charged us for 10 bucks a salad. If you're going to charge for salad, you should ask in a way that informs that it's ADDITIONAL.  Anyway, we pay the bill told him that he didn't inform us or mention that the salads were additional.

From time to time, she will call & ask if I've been lately & have the panna cotta for her haha They greet you like you are a lifelong friend, sooo welcoming. I really like the ambiance, too. Brick walls, dim lighting, quiet, very quaint. But enough about that, let's talk food. Every time I eat here, the waiters are super friendly & it's not put on at all. Willing to kindly go through all of the specials, recommended wines, etc. But let's get to the food, the pumpkin ravioli is THE BEST PASTA I'VE EVER HAD! Homemade noodles, fresh fresh pumpkin, perfectly seasoned & a hefty portion. I couldn't get enough, I feel like I could keep eating and eating it forever. Definitely worth a go!  Also, the chicken gnocchi with pesto is delicious, too. HUUUUGE portion & great from the first to last bite.  As many have said, definttely sign up on the mailing list. A few weeks after you go, the chef sends you a voucher along with a personnel note which is obviously a really nice gesture.

Appetizers: Calamari Griglia- the most unique calamari I've ever had, it's literally a whole squid grilled- the whole body (normally what you see sliced up and fried) and tentacles are grilled, all served on top of this balsamic vinegary sauce- the sauce was delectable, and everything tasted very clean and fresh Insalata Stella- a cold mix of greens, apples, raspberries, and cheese tossed in champagne vinaigrette.  I was impressed with how every slice of apple was perfectly cored and sliced the same size, the perfect 4 millimeters, as were the chunks of cheese all chopped into these perfect little edible square bites.  A light, refreshing salad. Main Dishes: Cappellacci all'Aragosta (Lobster Ravioli)- this was the best dish we had during the meal.  I don't even like lobster, but my friend ordered it, and it was delicious- the huge raviolis stuffed with real lobster meat chopped up with cheese (I think), with this light, vodka tomato sauce on top.  2 things surprised me about this dish: 1) I thought the ravioli would have chunks of lobster but it was made well with minced meat and a good blend of flavors inside- and 2) Normally lobster ravioli comes with a creamy alfredo sauce but this with the tomato sauce was perfect- it was a just-tangy complement to the creamy lobster filling and was what made the dish excellent Cappellacci di Zucca (Pumpkin Ravioli)- Excellent dish- I liked the chewiness of the ravioli skin, stuffed with a nice, dark pumpkin filling but what I loved the most were the chunks of squash on top, roasted in this salty, buttery sauce with fried, crispy sage for the perfect crunch.  It was super hearty dish, very filling, and delicious. Rigatoni Caprese- this was a good dish, not great- the rigatoni was too chewy for me (normally I love, love al dente but this was too much), thus if you eat too much, it's very filling.  The sauce was OK, and the chunks of mozzarella cheese weren't as melted as I would have liked.  Perhaps this dish was made first and thus not served right out of the oven.  A little more heat to get that stringy cheese action would have made it more enjoyable. Dessert: Panna Cotta of chocolate and hazelnut, tasted like extra firm jello, they gave you a generous portion with dark chocolate swirled on top.  I liked the subtle taste of both chocolate and hazelnut but would maybe get another dessert next time.  Their dessert menu wasn't very expansive, the only things that seemed appealing were this and the tiramisu.",0.9991,0.734,0.25,0.016,0.615391604010025

I decided to check this place out on a whim with a friend of mine because we were both wanting to try something new.  She wanted Italian, and I wanted to try Sapori, so it was a win-win.   The appetizers of choice (You get two with this deal):   Crostini Di Avocado -  Basically it is like Bruschetta with Avocado.  How can you go wrong?  It was a flavor orgy in my mouth! Calamari Fritti -  Fried Calamari.  'Nuff said. Soup and Salad (another 2): Caprese - Deliciously fresh mozzarella and tomatoes all covered in a flavorful Olive Oil.  Seriously.. this probably was so good because the ingredients were so fresh. Zuppa di Zucca - Creamy and Butternutty.  Flavored to perfection and served at the perfect temperature. Cappellacci all'Aragosta - So, you take some pasta and stuff with with Lobster and a few other seafoods and drench it in a tomato based cream sauce and all is right with the world. Salmone alle Erbe Aromatica - The fish was fresh.  VERY fresh and did not have the overwhelming fish taste.  It had the very subtle taste that you would expect from a well prepared fillet of salmon.  If you are a seafood lover - this dish is worth it.

The Bread Pudding - holy cow, save room for this! 5. Chef Anthony - so nice! he is always out and about chatting with people at some point during the night. He really cares about this place! Try it out! It can be really busy, but make a reservation, then it's no problem. When the weather is warm, sit outside at one of their patio tables, they are great!!",0.9572,0.725,0.202,0.073,0.5724120082815735

The outdoor seating in the summer is also great. It very well may be the best Italian spot in Lakeview. Unfortunately,  it's not the best pasta in Chicago - though priced comparably.  I would suggest visiting ONLY with a coupon. How do you get a coupon? Well, I no longer live in Chicago but I used to live down the street in Boystown. Fortunately,  my landlord has not changed my old buzzer from ringing my cell. So I continue to receive lovely buzz calls all night long. Please give me a call -I'll buzz you in!

Our waiter was quite knowledgeable of both the food and wine, and provided a spot-on wine recommendation and also suggested a few dishes we would like. Wow did we! There was this pumpkin, butternut squash pasta situation that was absolutely to die for. When we were done, our waiter came back and just pointed to a dessert. No words, just a ""you must eat this"" look. It was great!  All in all, this cute restaurant is by far one of the best in the city.

I wanted to order the linguine vongole (linguine with clams) because the white wine garlic sauce sounded appetizing, but i told our waiter that i wasn't sure because I don't really like clams.. most of the time they're chewy and tough, ick.  I told our waiter i really loved mussels so he offered to sub the clams for mussels.  I was hoping he would catch on to what I was hinting at and was really happy when he did :) When my dish came out I was a little blown away... it was COVERED in mussels!!!  As in.. a ridiculous amount of mussels!  Haha it was AWESOME.  I was so pleasantly surprised and by the end when I was stuffed, I was sad to see I had left about 1/3 of the mussels uneaten.  I rallied my friends and asked them to help me eat them because they were SOOOO GOOD and plentiful, so of course they helped me lol.  Everyone agreed the mussels were really good.  My friends all enjoyed the dishes they ordered too--the portions were large and the pasta was soooo good!  I love fresh pasta! The service here was EXCELLENT.  I don't think my water glass ever got below half full.. there was always someone there refilling my glass without me asking, which i LOVE.  Nice staff + warm bread + amazing seafood pasta = HAPPY HAPPY CUSTOMER!! The damage for my portion was not exactly pocket change.. shared bottle of wine, linguine with mussels ($22), tax + tip.. total came out to $46.  A little steep for Italian but I was so happy with everything (taste, quality, service) I didn't mind.  And I definitely wouldn't mind going back to this place if I'm ever in Chicago again :)",0.9992,0.629,0.323,0.048,0.6283151455026456

I've been here with friends, parents, and dates, and have found that it's really the perfect spot for any occassion. People are never disappointed.

First, the bread.  I think that the bread basket can set the tone for the meal, and we started off nicely.  Homemade breads with some really nice olive oil.   I started with the avocado appetizers, which I think were a special.  Oh. Wow.  I don't think I have ever eaten anything that amazing in my life.  The dish consisted of fresh avocado, tomato, mozzarella, basil, and some other stuff on top of a baguette.  Seriously, I considered cancelling my pasta and ordering more of the avocado dish.   However, I exercised some self-restraint, and held out for my noodles.  I had homemade tube noodles (I have no idea what they were called..they were giant tube-shaped noodes) that were made in-house that day.  The pasta was topped with fresh tomatoes, basil, mozzarella, olive oil, and just the right amount of seasoning.  Everything was so fresh.  No flavor overwhelmed me..it was just such a perfect blend.  I think that's how you know when you've got a great chef.   The person I was with had the lobster ravioli, and she really liked it.  I tried a bite, and it was delish.  Very rich.   We were so stuffed that we couldn't have possibly ordered dessert....but oh, will I ever be back.  Yum. The service was nice.  Attentive but not overbearing.  The interior had a quaint, neighborhood, yet upscale feel.  Prices were fair- about $20/dish.   (Note- I noticed that on Mondays they do a prix fixe for about $20/person.  That includes salad, soup, appetizer sampler, 2 pastas, dessert per person.  What a deal!)",0.9751,0.851,0.128,0.021,0.6548677248677248

We went here once before, and I recall liking the pumpkin ravioli.  Maybe that is the only star on their menu?  I ordered some kind of seafood and spaghetti here on Friday night.  The seafood was lacking in quality and quantity.  But worse yet, the marinara tasted like it came right from a jar of Ragu.  It was completely blah and did not taste fresh or homemade. Also, for a cheap bottle of wine, and 2 pasta entrees, our bill came out to $100 (no apps or dessert).  This place is known for sending tons of coupons in the mail, none of which I had with me during our visit.  I would appreciate it much more if they could just properly price the menu to begin with.  I'll throw down $30 on a pasta dish at Prosecco, but not Sapori. In the future, we'll stick with Mia Francesca's, Rose Angelis or Socca for fresh Italian dishes.  I'd say Sapori Trattoria, while somewhat charming, serves food which is more on par with Pasta Bowl.",0.8019,0.828,0.095,0.077,0.614984126984127

We started with the grilled calamari appetizer, which was fantastic.  Full calamari, grilled and half-sliced, served in something of an alternative balsamic reduction.  Atypical but awesome.  I would absolutely get this again. For the main course, I had a spaghetti with veal meatballs and mild italian sausage, served with a fantastic bolognese.  A fairly simple dish; but they killed it.  Just an awesome plate of food.  My date's pesto gnocchi was even better.  Big fluffy potato pillows of gnocchi were dressed in an absolutely divine pesto sauce.  Sapori found the perfect balance between basil, oil, pine nuts, and parmesan cheese.  This was one of the best pestos I have ever had.

Ever since that dinner at La Gondola my mom has been like a one-woman version of a six degrees game; you only have to tangentially mention something Italian for her to make the connection and start raving about that dinner and her plans to return.  We could've made a return appearance, but I wanted to try something different for my birthday. Unfortunately, neither the food nor service came close to the bar La Gondola had set so high with my family. Pluses:  + You can make reservations through Open Table.  + They have a dining club and  restaurant.com  gift certificates with few restrictions.  + The space is intimate and romantic; cloth tablecloths and napkins, votives on the tables, and exposed brick walls.  + The portions are generous, all three of us ended up taking some of our meals home.  + The food is very good; you could definitely tell the pasta was homemade. All three of us were happy with our meals, but not in an orgasmic, I'd sell my first born for another bite, or touch my plate and you'll be walking with a limp, sort of way. Minuses:  - We were seated at one of two high top tables near the bar. The table was very narrow across, had there been 4 in our party it would've felt really cramped. The tall chairs were very difficult to scoot closer to the table too, causing my parents problems.  - Service was inattentive; friendly, but inattentive. We had big lulls in our meal - our meals took a long time to arrive; we got the wrong dishes brought to our table; and we had to request our bread and drinks be replenished. Maybe our server was also covering the back of the place, because most times we couldn't even find her on the floor to get her attention.  - Meals are expensive. Pasta entrees range between $20-22 and are a la carte. First, I think there should be more than a $1-2 price disparity between a simple pasta with red sauce and something like lobster ravioli, linguine and clams, or pasta with veal meatballs. Second, I think at that price point a choice of soup or salad is appropriate.  - The TV in the ""bar area"" is unnecessary, if not inappropriate for the setting, even with the sound off. My parents, who were facing the TV, were visibly distracted by the Chargers-Giants game. Bottom line: The food was good, but I think there are other places in town where I can get more bang for my buck. I'll definitely give this place another chance, I'll just make sure I had some sort of coupon first.",0.99,0.852,0.11,0.037,0.46668816137566127

While we had a friendly waitress and table outside in the restaurant's lovely outdoor seating area, what really stuck in my mind was total failure of the dish that I ordered, from both a conceptual perspective and an execution perspective. I ordered the fresh fish of the day, which was chilean sea bass. The sea bass at Sapori suffered from a lack of seasoning, but more so from a lack of imagination. In order to really make the fish sing, the chef should have added some sort of acid to cut through the richness of the sea bass. The roasted vegetables beneath the fish were another offender. The zucchini was rubbery, and the yellow squash was undercooked. The highlight of the meal was the roasted asparagus - but there were only three spears, and the ends were undercooked to the point of being inedible. To make matters worse, I found scales on my fish. That is completely inexcusable and indefensible. I am all for serving fish with the skin on, but please, please, please make sure it is properly cleaned!

Our waiter was charming and the support staff was helpful with the refills of water and bread.  I was a little disappointed with the reservation system--I had made reservations and while we were seated quickly, other walk-ins who came in at the same time that we did were seated before us.

She was in the area and considering I had driven by here a bajillion times, (just an fyi that is a lot of times), I suggested it and she said yes. Score! I made a reservation and I was glad that I did. The place when I arrived was doing some good business, then about 20 minutes later it was packed. Large parties and six top tables abound, the place was jumping, people streaming in. I guess this would be a good time to reemphasize if you are coming on typically busy night, please make a reservation as it does seem to get rather busy.  I will say a few things impressed me. Actually, more like a near 100, a hundred bottles of wine. Did I take one down and pass it around? No. I didn't. I did have some really nice glasses of a Spanish red though. The selection is rather impressive, better than I would have thought. From other countries, Italy to right here in the good ol' US of A. A good selection of prices to boot.     The menu is fairly nice and has a lot of your regular typical Italian food, plus some interesting additions. We started off with some grilled calamari, smokey but slightly overdone and it came with a really great white wine sauce. We then moved on to her rigatoni with fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce and gnocchi in pesto with chicken and sun dried tomatoes. Her rigatoni was pretty delish, large chunks of the tasty white cheese in a pretty flavorful sauce. My gnocchi was pretty good, not the best, but it didn't stop me from eating the entire plate. .... What? I was hungry and it was good.  However... eating all the pasta made me full. Too full for dessert, it does happen folks. Not often, but alas it does happen. The service was good, he was a busy man, but made sure we were okay and that our wine glasses were always filled if we needed them to be. Price point wasn't too bad, $60 each including tip.

I'm referring to our love of delicious Italian food!)  My boyfriend is Italian, has lived in Florence for two years, and has eaten more pasta in his lifetime than one should ever consume... so when he says an Italian restaurant is good... I generally believe he knows what he's talking about. And let me tell you, Sapori Trattoria was wonderful! It was everything an Italian restaurant should be. It was quaint and romantic with dim lighting, perfect spot for a date.  For starters, we had wine and an appetizer, the grilled calamari. Our wine was great and the appetizer was good. However, grilled calamari wherever I've ordered it tends to be slightly bland for my personal liking so I would opt to try something else.  Our entrees were exquisite! I had the lobster stuffed ravioli in a light pink sauce, similar to a vodka pasta sauce. It literally melted in my mouth! :) I would def. recommend it! However, in comparison to the other dishes, the portion size was notably smaller... I don't know why. Oh well!  My boyfriend ordered the butternut squash ravioli and it was orgasmic... I say that because when I had a bite, I let out this dramatic embarrassing moan. It was def. a ""when harry met sally"" moment! So GOOD! Tasted like a dessert almost! Would def. recommend if you would like to indulge your sweet tooth! :)  For dessert, we ordered the bread pudding. Not much of a dessert person, but my boyfriend loved it!  The only bad part was that our bill came out to be 85 dollars which was quite more than we had originally intended to spend.

They have cool art on the walls (some of which are brick exposed), simple decor, and sometimes they have a jazz band play.

2009-04-29,2.0,"This place gets 2 stars because it's where my Fiancee and I had our first date, and that's stretching the truth a bit.  That night, we shared the Caprese salad (which is delicious) and each ended up ordering the pumpkin/squash pasta dish that everyone says is awesome.  I remember that being good, so on the day I proposed, we went back (i'm romantic, I guess). Sadly, Sapori failed to impress this time around.  Again, we shared the Caprese and it was good.  We both had a glass of riesling and I ordered the pasta with chicken and gnocchi, prepared with a pesto sauce. The pesto sauce was incredible and the gnocchi was perfectly prepared.  Sadly, the chicken was dry, bland, and chewy.  I don't understand how they could send out dry, bland, chewy chicken chunks in a pasta like this.  Either cook it properly or use thigh meat, which is always juicier and more flavorful anyway.  The chicken was inedible and I pushed it all off to the side. My fiance had the mushroom risotto, which was disappointing (or disgusting, depending on whom you ask).  After tasting it, I think I figured out the problem.  The 'chef' used a strong red wine (lots of tannins, possibly soured and past usable), which made the wine flavor come to the front of the tongue and ruined an otherwise well cooked dish.  Now I've seen recipes that call for dry WHITE wine.  I've seen recipes that call for truffle oil.  But I've NEVER seen a recipe for risotto that called for red wine before.  And this is specifically why!  Risotto is a rustic, classic italian dish that is supposed to be full of flavor.  The most commonly used descriptor for Risotto is 'creamy'.  And the texture was indeed creamy.  However, the wine flavor clearly overpowered the rest of the dish, making it taste almost spoiled, sour, and a little bitter.  Chef Anthony is a nice enough fellow.  He's said hello before and seems interested in making his restaurant fun and successful.  I would caution him that creativity in classic, rustic dishes is dangerous.  If he can't taste how a heavy red wine ruins his risotto, I think he needs some palette work.  There is plenty of space for creativity - his lasagna is very interesting and the pumpkin/squash pasta is a delight - but you just can't start throwing bizarre flavors together and expect people to shell out the big bucks for a disappointing dish. Simply put - if I can make a better mushroom risotto at home than a chef who owns a restaurant, I won't be back to that restaurant, and if I do go back, it won't be to order the risotto. The Lasagna looks delicious, the pumpkin pasta is great, and they haven't figured out how to screw up a Caprese salad, but you should avoid the mushroom risotto unless you enjoy punishing yourself.  Also, the pesto with chicken needs some work before I would recommend it.  Standards, Chef Anthony.  They are essential.   There is no excuse for dry, bland, overcooked pieces of chicken breast in a pesto gnocchi and there is absolutely no reason to add red wine to a mushroom risotto, ESPECIALLY if it makes the risotto taste sour and spoiled.

Who would have thought that ribs would steal the show at an Italian restaurant? I know you probably don't believe this about me, but I'm not that big on ribs. But that all changed last night. I am now a total ribhead. I look forward to lunchtime so I can go to McDonald's and get a McRib. Hopefully the McRib, which I only vaguely remember from my childhood, is braised in milk and honey and then browned with carrots and chanterelles.  Okay, enough about McDonald's. We split the ribs as an appetizer, so guess what I got for a main course... No, not the pumpkin ravioli that everyone seems to mention in the reviews. Actually, no one at the table was willing to step up to the plate and order that, which totally pissed me off, but once I got my entree, my anger subsided and I stopped beating my head against the table. Give up? I got the lobster ravioli!!!111one It was totally wicked. 5 big raviolis, slightly sweet, with a discernible lobster flavor in a delicious tomato-based sauce. What's super creepy though, is after I got home, Throwdown was on, and Bobby Flay had to take on these two ravioli masters. Flay wins. Spoiler alert.  We had some above average tiramisu for dessert. I still haven't found another restaurant that serves the same style of tiramisu that Caro Mio does, but Sapori's was delicious enough to keep me from crying. Service was great.

We also tried a porcini risotto and the flavor of the mushrooms and the sauce mixed well together.   However, the caprese salad was less than mediocre.  The tomatoes and mozzarella were not fresh.  It was well worth ordering and pairing this up with a glass of red wine made the meal feel like I was in Florence overlooking a replica of Michelangelo's David.

I'm a fan"" for now. As with Kyoto, I can't believe it's taken me this long to go to Sapori when it's just a short walk from home. That will be remedied with many future visits.  This place really met my need for a cozy, warm restaurant with delicious comfort food on a cold Chicago night. I would never predict the warm, inviting atmosphere waiting for me inside by looking at the exterior of this place. I guess they're right when they say don't judge a book by it's cover, whoever they are.  Anyway, on to the food. Yum. As I mentioned, we did the family style dinner, so we had lots of food. First of all, the bread is a good indication of what's to come. It was warm and soft on the inside with a nice crunchy crust. I love that they give you Parmesan cheese with the olive oil to make a pasty (and tasty) dip for the bread. We started with the grilled calamari and avocado crostini (the crostini was so simple but so good), moved on to minestrone soup and caprese salad (both good), then 3 pastas: penne with a tomato-ish sauce, pumpkin ravioli with butternut squash and pine nuts and spaghetti-ish noodles with a shrimp and a broccoli puree sauce. All were fantastic. The ravioli is so rich and decadent, which is offset well with the pine nuts and squash. My favorite was the one with the broccoli puree. Who'd of thought to puree broccoli for a pasta sauce? Not me, but I loved it. We finished with the bread pudding, which was very good, but I was so full by that point I really couldn't eat much more. We had plenty of leftovers; I definitely think the family style is a great deal.  Our waiter was very helpful in his suggestions and was entertaining in his wittiness. As I mentioned, this place just oozes coziness. It's great for a date, an evening with the girls, or whatever occasion, really. We sat by the front window, and it was nice to bask in the warmth, enjoying our delicious wine and food, while watching the bundled up masses hustle by out on Halsted.  The bathroom is bright and clean and fine, but it could use some girly decor to up the cuteness factor. Maybe I'm weird, but I like a picture, or something to look at on the wall.

It goes without saying that the food is incredible. It's the type of restaurant where you want to try everything (and everything will be fantastic), but you will quickly find your favorite and stick to it.  For me it's the spaghetti with veal meatballs and sausage, others are big fans of the lasagna.  Just don't eat all the delicious bread before your meal comes, as it's tough enough to finish an entree here on it's own. What I really enjoy about Sapori Trattoria though is the quirkiness of the chef.  I regularly get coupons in the mail with extremely long, hand written letters/stories spanning the envelope and enclosed documents from him.  It's utterly bizarre but also completely awesome.

The highlight of the dinner was the tiramisu dessert.  My fiance is a huge tiramisu fan. I personally could take it or leave it, but this one was absolutely delicious!

Nothin' special, could've been done better.  Bruschetta: hmmm. Boring, but edible. I spilled a lot of chopped tomatoes into my lap.  Fried Calimari: Very good, great sauce.  Pesto/Chicken Gnocchi: Good, though the pieces of chicken were pretty big, probably better a bit chopped up to blend into the dish.  Seafood something or other: It was well received, I am not partial to seafood so I opted out.  Salmon: A bit undercooked, but if you drenched it in the dill sauce, it was OK.  Tiramasu: Good, though a bit dry and in need of real cocoa.  Overall: Pretty good bang for the buck. $20 and you'll be STUFFED.

Overcooked salmon, overcooked chicken, overcooked seafood in the risotto. But delicious gnocchi, especially the pesto sauce. The tiramisu was good, but they covered it in Hershey's syrup instead of cocoa which ultimately kept me from eating it.  They seem to be missing the details at Sapori. The music overhead was reggae and ska, the croutons in the salad came out of a box, and the bruschetta bread slices were cut so thickly that there was no way to eat it without all the tomatoes falling off. Let alone the Hershey's syrup on the tiramisu. Why on earth would they do that?  I imagine the dishes on the menu are why people keep going back.

I had heard from reviews that the rissotto was impeccable, which after the mean I must completely agree. My wife had the pumpkin pasta, which was excellent as well. I highly recommend both dishes. One thing to keep in mind is the portion size. The rissotto is enough for 2-3 people, whereas the pumpkin was a petite but tasty for 1. Throughout the meal, our waiter Mike and )Ricardo (the manager?) came to check on us. He and his staff did a fabulous job of making us feel special. We'll definitely be dining here again and with other friends. Highly recommended to share with friends.

It all worked out because we were seated quickly in a warm locale in the back. The delicious warm bread was some of the best I have had in ages! I would have eaten more but I did not want to embarrass myself. I did have a small complaint...the ceaser salad left a little to be desired. The dressing is made by the chef but to be honest I could not tell the difference between it and Italian dressing. Oh and you can tell the salad was dressed early in the evening because the croutons were soft. My food was so wonderful. I ordered the shrimp and broccoli pasta dish..it was so delicious. It was filled with shrimp and so satisfying. In fact I had to take more than half home. It reheated well. My friends orders the lobster pasta and it was equally as tasty...just a bit richer! My other friend got the rigatoni caprese and we all loved it. It was very fresh. I would really recommend this place.

It was my second visit here--the first was with a big group in 2006. From my perspective, this is a nice place conveniently located in a neighborhood that doesn't boast that many ""real"" restaurants. Lots of first dates, friend dates and groups...and despite the fact that I've mentioned groups twice, I can't figure out why it's so noisy! (But is was.) The food: Friend and I opted to share the Stella salad and seafood risotto. Without being asked, the kitchen split both dishes for us and most importantly, we WERE NOT charged for this inconvenience. Nor were we made to feel bad about having wimpy girly stomachs. Very good. The salad was good, but I would have preferred a little less dressing. I'm picky though. The risotto was great--VERY generous portions of most everything--but after 3 pieces of bread, I couldn't finish it. Note: Each table gets its own thing of parmesan and olive oil = dangerous. Love that a large Pellegrino is only $5 and the waitress remembered the extra limes. She wasn't the most attentive, but she was very efficient and we didn't have to flag her down when we wanted the check. Again, important and good. The manager looked familiar, but gave me a crazy look when I asked if I knew him from somewhere. Why do I include this? Dunno, just so you'll know that it ended on an awkward note.

For entrees, I had the lobster ravioli and my husband had the meat lasagna.  The lobster ravioli was just OK, although the sauce was delicious - lobster could've been more fresh.  The meat lasagna was good, but not great, however, it serves well (better) as day-after leftovers.  We passed on dessert and opted for gelato and Cafe Gelateria near there.
