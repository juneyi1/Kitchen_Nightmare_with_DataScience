A bottle of wine was reasonably priced. Caprese was delicious and seasoned with salt and pepper that added some additional flavor. The rigatoni had good spice and flavor with pieces of sliced encased sausage. The Gorgonzola tortellini  was good, although very rich. Some bread or added veggies or protein would have cut the richness a bit.   I ate it all but will try something different next time. I would have ordered a dessert had it been offered-not sure if it's regularly available or not. The calm, relaxed atmosphere and service makes this place what it is. Will certainly return!

2016-10-24,5.0,"Cafe Ciao is a terrific place for so many reasons. It is completely unpretentious, with some of the friendliest crew around. The first time my spouse and I stopped in, the owner, Julie made a point to stop at our table to introduce herself. That was about 2 years ago, and Ciao has since become one of our favorite neighborhood spots which is saying something in the West Loop! We have also gotten to know Jeremy (the ""Hat Guy""), head of their bar program, Aleta, Chef Extraordinaire, and many friendly servers who all give this place the warm, inviting atmosphere we've come to love. When you eat here, you feel like you have been transported to a European cafe.   The food and drinks are also phenomenal. We quickly fell head over heels for the Lord Grantham (their clever spin on an Old Fashioned), the baked mac & cheese (some of the best!), and of course, their Rigatoni. I dream about that sauce! Ooooh and I almost forgot about the bread pudding. My god is it good! Ciao is usually pretty low key on weeknights, and they often have live music on the weekends (check their Facebook for updates). Whether you want a quiet date night spot, or a lively place to see some music, you can get what you need here.",0.9874,0.799,0.175,0.026,0.5454545454545454

2016-08-05,4.0,"Adorable little place. Went on a Monday evening and my hubby and had the place to ourselves. This may seem odd, but the olives were fantastic. I kept trying to figure out what the marinade was, but I couldn't place it. They were delicious though! We also tried the spicy goat cheese crostini. It was surprisingly bland, but not terrible. The empanadas were even more bland and even some salt would have helped. We ordered a bottle of merlot... They were out. We opted instead for a Rioja blend. They were out. We asked for a sample of another wine, we were told they did not have one already opened and therefore could not give us a sample. Huh? I'm not ordering an entire bottle of wine that I may hate. Or maybe I would...because that's what I did. The waitress recommended a different Merlot so we said fine. It was described as velvety. Not so much. Kind of tasted like two buck chuck to me. Whatever. After the first two glasses who cares, right?  So by now you're thinking, ""why give it 4 stars??"" Bear with me. After the two glasses of wine I forgot all about my diet and ordered the Gorgonzola tortellini. I could have liked the plate. Delicious. Fresh homemade gnocchi in place of the tortellini would have been orgasmic but it was still super. And then since the diet was already blown, I ordered the bread pudding. The best bread pudding I have ever had. It's been 5 days and I'm still dreaming of it. For a wine lounge, their wine selection seemed rather weak, and refusing to allow a taste before purchasing when the menu states that wine is sold by the glass as well is ridiculous. I like the idea of their small plates and appetizers but they could be more attentive with the seasoning. Overall though, I would recommend this place and hope to return.

The bar is also unique.  Bartenders pay particular attention to their mixed cocketails, made with fresh ingredients.  They don't just dump a bunch booze and juices in a shaker.  They pay attention to details and craft a really well made cocktail.  Try the Old Fashioned or in the winter, the Hot Toddy.  They also change up the wine and beer selection often with boutique wines and microbrews.   Finally, a really enjoy the jazzy musicians who perform on weekends.  Take a date to this place.  It's really charming and laid back.",0.9859,0.807,0.15,0.043,0.4737179487179487

So we decided tonight was the night, googled the name, found some coupons on  resturant.com  and started strolling over.   Upon walking in and presenting the coupon to the owner/manager. I'm such a rookie. What appeared to be a good deal, wasn't.  Burned by the terms and conditions, again.   No more than 20 seats in total, only two tables of two were seated when we walked in.  Bored games (pun intended) and what looks to be a karaoke system makes the place look like it could be fun however the ambiance makes you feel confused as to its identity.  They had half price wine night, usually a win but couldn't take advantage of it due to the choice of using the coupon or getting the wine deal. We both ordered the angel hair pasta, substitute wheat pasta, with meatballs and shrimp and shared a caprese salad to start.   We were annoyed and went No vino.  Maybe our hopes for this cute little cuddly Italian Sinatra wine bar were too high?    The food was so underwhelming. The marinara sauce had little taste and the staff couldn't care less that we were there.

2014-03-10,2.0,"So I'll start out with the positives.  The food was very good and the ambiance was inviting.  We ordered several things on the menu, I had the rigatoni, it was delicious.  We were also surprised when we found out they had live music coming in later in the evening and the restaurant owner personally came out and invited us to stay to listen to the music.  Up until the end, I would have given this place 4.5 stars, perhaps even 5....  The reason for only 2 stars... the service wasn't great.  In fact, at points, our server was downright rude.  I purchased a Travelzoo voucher for Cafe Ciao.  My party of 4 had never been there before and the voucher sounded like quite the deal and reason enough to venture out of our neighborhood during a cold Chicago winter... the voucher read as follows:   -  For $20 (reg. $40) sample anything on the menu. -  We recommend a starter such as the ""eclectic"" small plates and two entrees such as the house specialty rigatoni all rigo - Or pair two entrees with two glasses of wine from the cafe's ""respectable"" list. - For $30 (reg. $60), dine with a party of four and save even more.   Now, the fine print reads that anything additional that exceeds the vouchers value is the guests responsibility.... totally fair.  Now, if you read that description, doesn't it sound like you get two entrees and two glasses of wine for $20 (regularly $40)?  That was how I read it... So we get to the restaurant on Friday night, and I tell our server that we had the travelzoo voucher and I asked him if I understood the voucher correctly, that we each pick one glass of wine and one entree (we purchased the voucher for 4 people).  He said yes, that was the deal, and then as we all ordered the same kind of wine, he suggested a bottle and we asked if that was included in the deal and he said yes.  So, under the impression that we could each order an entree and a glass of wine for $30 (which yes, does seem too good to be true, but that is what the voucher said, no?)  we ordered an appetizer and a second bottle of wine, assuming that would be the only cost on our bill after the voucher was redeemed.  We were surprised when our bill came to $150, after the voucher...  so we asked for clarification on the bill as we were under the impression that 4 entrees and 4 glasses of wine would be covered under the terms of the voucher.  Our ever so professional and kind server (note sarcasm) redeemed the voucher, I asked him to read it and tell me if I was in fact reading it wrong.... his response, ""I didnt' write the voucher""... and that was that.  Excuse me, I don't care who wrote the voucher, Cafe Ciao approved the voucher.... Cafe Ciao is the host of the voucher.... therefore, Cafe Ciao is responsible for the voucher... all of which I said to him.  So after our server essentially tried to make me feel like and idiot, he took our money, did not offer any sort of apology for the misleading voucher, and stood behind the bar and talked about us (it is a very small place, you can hear, not to mention see him and his friend looking at us).  Then as we finished our wine, he never came back to see if we needed anything else, which I did.   At first I was also surprised that they added gratuity for a party of four... but now I can see why.... with service that poor, they are probably worried they would get no tip at all.

With a menu that small, I expect everything to be made in-house!! How difficult is it to make meatballs??? The other dishes (mac & cheese, Italian sausage and flatbread) were fine. Nothing exciting.

2013-08-16,2.0,"UNDERWHELMING! This place could use the folks from Restaurant Impossible and Bar Rescue. The service, food, and atmosphere have one thing in common: They all need to be improved. My rating and comments are based on numerous visits to this joint. It's a neighborhood place that is quiet, not on Randolph (a plus some nights) and that always serves up mediocrity. And that's why I've gone and still stop by on occasion.  First, the service. A recent experience sums it up best. I sat outside. There is/was some minor road improvements/construction nearby (not going on while I was eating). The outside tables were caked in dust and dirt when I sat down. The server/bartender guy was surely to have brought out a rag and wiped the table down, but it never happened. He did however have time to down a glass of wine behind the bar. I also shouldn't have to repeatedly ask to have my water glass refilled. This is not a place where you're going to ""yelp"" about the stellar, attentive, detail-oriented staff. Believe it or not it's actually gotten better within the past year since some other server guy apparently isn't there (or not as often). He was soooooo slow.  Second, the food. If one of those reality restaurant make-over show hosts came in, he would probably take a bite of the food and spit it out since the meatballs are frozen, the sauce(s) are obviously from a jar, etc. It wouldn't hurt for them to go fresh. Make some stuff in house. The menu is carb heavy. They need to add some proteins/fish that are fresh. And add some desert items. You're not going to storm out of the place or demand a refund after you have a few bites from their current menu, but many of us expect more/better.  Third, the atmosphere. The restaurant make-over folks would come and note that the place is stale and not cohesive. You've got chairs that are broken and have holes in them. Framed 1990s-style posters on the wall that are outdated and out of place. And then you toss in some karoake, board games, and some folks who come in and sing. All in a pretty small place. They need to invest about ten grand into updating the place. The food and service could be underwhelming but at least pretend that you know what you're doing.  With more development coming to Madison Street and the neighborhood, they're going to have to step up their game to be relevant.  When I want real fresh Italian food (and better service), I'll go down the street to Viaggio or head up to Filippo's in Lincoln Park. When I want mediocre frozen food, an outdated atmosphere, and sub-par service, I head to Ciao. They need to make Ciao a legit (yelp) four star destination.

To be honest, I was nervous when I saw how limited the menu was but after tasting the food I am definitely okay with the small selection. The food was absolutely devine.

The place is small which gives it charm and you feel like you get to know the owners and the staff, but if you are not looking for that type of atmosphere this isn't the place for you.

2012-05-09,2.0,"Disclaimer: It pains me to write this review because I REALLY wanted to love Cafe Caio because I've lived in the West Loop for 5 years and have wanted to try this cute place.  However, I did not love Cafe Ciao.  Very disheartened.  My fiance and I went on a Friday evening at 7pm.  We made a reservation but when we arrived no one was there to take the reservation or seat us at our table.  We were told by 1 of the 2 people working to find a seat anywhere...so we did.  We sat at a tiny 2-person table near the fireplace. The waiter arrived and we told him that we would be using a Ruelala Chicago deal.  He explained that the deal was incorrect and that we would only receive 1 glass of wine each (the deal said 2 glasses each in addition to 1 appetizer and 2 entrees).  We were disappointed but to compensate for the misprint he gave us 1 additional glass for free.  That was nice.  What we didn't receive, however, was any water.  So strange.  The waiter acted as if he didn't want to be there either.  His hand was on his hip the entire time he took our order and also when we checked up on us once.  The wine was sub-par.  The bruschetta was average...however it was drowning in balsamic.  I had the margarita pizza and it was below average.  Not cooked enough and it was wet in the middle (crust).  My finace had the Rigatoni Alla Rigo (their specialty) and it was good.   We will not be back to Cafe Ciao and I hate writing that because I am a huge proponent of locally owned and operated businesses....just not this one.",0.8592,0.842,0.091,0.066,0.5284090909090909
2012-05-07,2.0,"Another weird experience.  If I lived nearby I'd stop in for wine.  Its cute.  But the service is like someone who's never worked in the industry before and the food seems to be an afterthought.  Since my Bloomspot deal was expiring soon I called over for a rez.  I love it when they act like going there for dinner is a big deal.  They ""squeezed me in"" at 6 on a Thursday.  This is funny because when I got there it had 1 woman on the love seat and 1 woman at the bar.  The entire time we were there only 1 other table of 4 arrived.  When I walked in since I had a reservation I wasn't sure if they seat your or what.  I stood there for a bit unnoticed so I picked my own table. The guy comes over and goes over the options of my deal and brings me the wine while I wait for my boyfriend.  The wine was good!   We shared the chevre which was like a triangle of Laughing Cow cheese, unseasoned greens and some bread.  Fine.   I had the angel hair which was very saucy and garlicky.  My boyfriend got the baked pasta w/ vodka creme sauce and sausage.  He liked it.  But there was  no offering of cheese, or pepper, or bread.  When he took away our starter plates he moved our knives and forks to the table.  I don't know.  After I use a utensil I don't want to put it on the table.  It freaks me out.",0.9788,0.823,0.135,0.041,0.6562091503267974

He came in and sit down at the bar and nobody really seemed to pay attention, which was sort of an awkward way to handle the situation.    It wasn't so great that we will be rushing back any time soon, but if we're in the neighborhood or need a casual place to grab wine and a bite with girlfriends I would stop in again.",0.8822,0.787,0.121,0.092,0.5028289810547875

Loop.  The food is incredible and the service is generally spot on.  So, Amanda S., the couple at the bar who decided to leave that evening in fact, does yelp, albeit very sparingly.  The restaurant business is hard and on a night like this, the management is faced with a split second decision, to close or go on with the show.  These situations are few and far between and generally an anomaly.  For someone not to be able to differentiate an ""off night"" from a place with truly bad or rude service, then to chirp on and on about bad service, is what is really a disservice to others.  This place deserves all the four stars it has, and despite one bad night, I will continue to freqent Cafe Ciao and the dozens of other local establishments that routinely go above and beyond to put out a good product.",-0.6124,0.865,0.056,0.078,0.42453379953379944

2012-01-28,1.0,"I'm catching up on writing a bunch of reviews, so this is a few weeks old, but at the top of my ""must-review"" list. I'd almost feel like I was doing a disservice to the public by letting this place continue to fool people with a 4 star average on Yelp. The only thing I can guess is that people are reviewing this place only on the food. Is the food good? Yes, I'd say the pasta and chevre appetizer that we had was above average. The service? Hands down the worst I have had in the past few years. We walked into the small, quaint space on a Friday night around 8:30PM. The place was 3/4 full but there was only 1 server/bartender, and 1 chef that kept running through the front to throw out garbage, get more food, and we were completely ignored for about 5 minutes. We had reservations, and the server told us we could wait at the bar until he cleared off our table. Ok, you're busy, we get it. We waited at the bar, unable to get drinks, or even water since there was only one server and he was clearing off our table. No problem, but would have been nice to been offer a drink list or the menu while we waited. We get to the table and mention to our waiter that we purchased a ""Bloomspot"" deal. Immediately he seemed disappointed and I guess determined we wouldn't be spending any more money. (The deal cost $25 for a $45 value dinner for 2, which I agree is an amazing deal, but you came out with it, not us! So don't blame us!). Our server proceeded to tell us that the Bloomspot dinner only came with the choice of the two house wines, two appetizers, and two pastas. He disappeared for 20 minutes when we couldn't make up our minds on the spot. So after 20 minutes, we flagged the server down and at least were able to put in our order for 1 glass of the house red and 1 of the white- both which turned out to be awful. While we were waiting, we overheard a couple sitting at the bar ask the chef for a glass of water. They had purchased a nice bottle of wine and had been trying to flag down the server for about 10 minutes. The chef simply held up both her hands full of stuff and said, ""Sorry I'm really busy"". They waited 10 more minutes, got not attention from the server, and finally just asked if they could get the bill, corked their wine, and went home.  I guess those people don't yelp... I also realized that we didn't get any water during our full dinner either. Meanwhile, the server still hadn't stopped back at our table. My boyfriend was getting really upset, but I rationalized that he was the only server and the restaurant was pretty full for 1 person to be handling almost 10 tables. But by the time he got back to our table, we literally had been at the restaurant for 45 minutes and only had our awful wine. Somehow it got worse. The waiter came back and we finally tried to put in all 4 of our items to order- the meatballs and mac and cheese appetizers, the rigatoni and the angel hair pasta. They were actually out of the meatballs, mac and cheese, and house specialty rigatoni! 3 items off an already limited menu! So I asked if I could just have a flatbread instead of a pasta since it was cheaper anyhow. No substitutions he said. My boyfriend asked what they DID have, which i thought was a reasonable question since 3 out of the 4 things we just ordered were not available. I guess that pissed him off, because he snapped back at us by reciting everything else on the menu, then disappearing.  10 minutes later he felt like he should get it over with and get our orders. We decided on a few more things and it came after about 25 more minutes. At this point, the food was an afterthought, but like I said, it was above average. We ate quickly since we were coming up on 90 minutes there and couldn't wait to get out. We asked for the check, and to our shock, our waiter had already added his tip into the bill at 20%. Really? I have never used a Bloomspot or Groupon where the vendor added the tip in automatically.  Even at Charlie Trotter's they only add 18% if they are going to force it upon you.  The final straw was when we asked for change for a $20 and the waiter brought back 20 singles. Needless to say we will never be back, great deal or not.",-0.9308,0.862,0.063,0.075,0.5095720720720722

We were pleased to find a small but comprehensive wine list, daily specials, and a small plate menu. I enjoyed the balanced flavors of my sauvignon blanc, my friend ordered a second glass of her red, and we thought the papas bravas had just the right amount of kick. Not bad, considering that we chose this place at random and had no idea what to expect. The real surprise was the personal service from the friendly, attentive staff. We were never left with a near-empty glass of water, the server remembered what we were both drinking and didn't have to ask my friend what she wanted a second glass of, and there was not even the suggestion of impatience while we waffled back and forth over what to eat. This is exactly what a small, intimate cafe should be! I was not as impressed with the bathroom, which had a line, a flickering light, and a sticky spot on the floor. It isn't a really gross bathroom or anything, but I had pretty high expectations by the time I had to use it since everything else had been so excellent. Our table was also wobbly, and there were some customers whose voices were far too loud for such an intimate space. In short, I would come back here again in a heartbeat. I didn't expect to like a wine-centric place so much, but I found it very pleasant and charming. I'd recommend this place to anybody who wants to dip a toe into the wine scene or the tapas scene or looking for a low-key, nonthreatening place to enjoy a glass with some friends without the server being snobby and snorty about your pairings.

And speaking of Julie - she is one of the sweetest people I have ever met.  She always takes the time to stop by and say hello and ask how everything is going.   When friends and family would come down to see the new place, I would always bring them here for dinner.  Cafe Ciao won them over as well.   It's a small, intimate place that is the perfect ambience for a date or for a quiet dinner with a couple of friends.",0.9891,0.801,0.177,0.022,0.5814806721056721

The artichoke spinach dip was a small dollop of dip surrounded by chips.  Who serves spinach dip this way?

2010-04-23,5.0,"I went to Cafe Ciao for dinner last night after finding it via Yelp.  It was practically empty at 830 when we walked in - just one table of 2 - but immediately the bartender/waiter let us know we could sit anywhere and we of course chose a table where we could watch the ending of the Bulls/Cavs game on their giant flat screen.  Don't get confused though - this is definitely not a sports bar - just a cozy, intimate spot where you feel like you're dining in someone's living room (complete with roaring fireplace, sofa and ottoman).   The menu is small and simple, and at first I was worried that I was going to pay a premium for something that I could have just made at home.  I mean, the whole point of going out is to do something out of the ordinary, right?  Well, after the first bite of my angel hair pasta, that thought went out the window.  It was beyond delicious - as was the caprese, as was the boy's rigatoni, and our sinful fried cookie dough/blueberry in a wonton sundae.  We cleaned our plates - and they weren't small!  In other words, the short menu is just Cafe Ciao's way of saying ""Rather than do 50 mediocre things, we're going to do 15 AWESOME things.""  Also - can't believe the reviews I read on the bad service.  Ours was fantastic - from the moment we stepped in the door, between the decor and the service, we really did feel like we were someone's honored house guests.  The casual atmosphere, knowledgable/friendly bartender/server, and the (owner? chef?) woman who came around to speak to the customers at the end of the evening were all top-notch.    We will definitely be putting this place in our roundhouse and going back.",0.9856,0.819,0.134,0.046,0.5418394777265746

We just went tonight and I am still full, all for $35 + tax/tip.  Wednesday night specials for $25 gets you bruschetta (with balsamic vinegar, interesting twist), two entrees (we got chicken pesto flatbread and the rigatoni) and dessert (a toasted blueberry muffin with ice cream and caramel...yum).  Also on special was white wine sangria and there you go... cheap, fun, romantic evening. To the people who complain about the service, give me a break.  The minute you walk into the door, any reasonable person would realize this is one of those places you linger and enjoy a cup of coffee or a glass of wine and it's really informal and they're not rushing you out of there.  There's no hostess and it's usually just the owner and a server, you sit where you want and hang out and people watch.  If you want ""perfect"", fast service, go be one of those yuppies waiting in line at Chili's on State Street.",0.9773,0.83,0.133,0.037,0.4920068027210883
