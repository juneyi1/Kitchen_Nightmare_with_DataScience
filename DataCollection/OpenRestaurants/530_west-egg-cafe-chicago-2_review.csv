It's very annoying to have to swat them away with one hand, while you the other hand is feeding you. The portions have always been midwestern style big, so that's pretty good. The place has been here for a long long time and they always have a huge crowd coming in, as there is a few hotels near the restaurant.

I'm not sure if they use real bacon bc it was tuff and chopped up finely (it looks and taste love like the dry bacon you shake out of a plastic bottle).

Very nice not to concern yourself with water refills, it's all there. Very large portions, so be prepared! In my experience, Eggs Benedict is usually served to fill one person, including the sides that may come with it, however, I could only finish half of one order! The Albuquerque Turkey Benedict is traditional to the recipe but with (many) slices of turkey instead of Canadian bacon and creamy avocado added.

Ran into some of the crew from Emirates team and Oracle team that happen to be having breakfast there before heading out on the lake for America's Cup. That was pretty cool to see. For food, I did their breakfast burrito with chorizo. The green chilies inside were a nice touch to make it seem somewhat unique. Not your typical breakfast burrito as it is doused with red sauce/salsa, sour cream and cheese on top so that you basically have at it with a knife and fork. Overall, pretty tasty and also served with a small side of fruit and homestyle potatoes which were well seasoned.    Service is minimal. They leave a pitcher of water for you at the table so you can refill your water. If you get coffee too, they'll leave the pitcher of coffee at your table to refill as you please. Once you're done, they drop off the check and you walk over to the cashier to pay your bill on your way out. The waiters/waitresses are really only there to take your order and bring out your food.  No gimmicks here, just a standard breakfast cafe with a good amount of selection of items for breakfast.

We have been here before and it's always a popular location because its always crowded and the traffic waved come and go, which says much about this place. Nancy was telling us that the owners are originally from Dominican Republic in South Latin America. So the plates and ideas are from their roots. They've been here for at least 30years and its thriving as  my own eyes witnesses. All the staff move around pretty fast and I love the energy that they carry through the restaurant.  Also the names on the menu are pretty funny and catchy. As you receive the bill, you have to go to the counter and pay there, which I wish they would just take the payment as normal restaurants do, but the food sure makes it worth your while.  You can also choose from different souvenirs for all ages. They have baby onesies and T-shirts, hats etc. We will be back. So far the best breakfast spot in Streeterville.",0.9977,0.741,0.235,0.024,0.6153262786596121
2016-04-05,2.0,"""Meh"" sums the experience up pretty well.  I had plans to meet three friends for breakfast at 10:30. The earliest friend arrived about five minutes early and was seated right away. Another friend and I got there at 10:32. We were looking at the menus while waiting for the fourth friend to arrive when the server came to take our order at 10:37. We said we were going to wait until our fourth member arrived to order (she had just walked through the door) when the server rudely interrupted to say ""In case you weren't aware, we have quite a large wait and it would be appreciated if you hurried up"" before walking away. The rest of the meal was rushed. Checks were dropped off super early in the meal and we were asked several times if we had finished yet so plates could be cleared. Food was adequate -- nothing special. It was edible and coffee was continuously refilled so I gave two stars.  I used to be a server so I'm well aware that the faster you flip a table, the faster you make a tip. But taking seven minutes to peruse a menu and relax is normal, and there was no reason for our server to be as hostile and impatient as he was.",0.9574,0.798,0.141,0.062,0.4050420168067227

The food was really bland and boring, despite sounding really great on the menu. To make matters worse, the coffee was terrible.

The menu is typical of a brunch place - omelettes, skillets, pancakes. Didn't see anything on the menu that really stood out to me. I got a ham and mushroom skillet, which was good. It came with a small cup of fruit and an english muffin.   Ambience is a small diner feel. Unpretentious though a little loud. The staff is friendly.

Pretty basic looking cafe but it was clean and there were lots of people there enjoying their meals. I had the Denver scramble which was quite delicious. Nothing too heavy or nor was the proportions huge which was something I wasn't looking for in a breakfast. If you are looking for a place that serves hashbrowns this isn't it. I didn't mind though, I wasn't looking to be in a food coma. Coffee was good too. I could have lived without the crack from the server when I tried to pour the water and some of it ended up on the table and lap.

2015-08-22,4.0,"Finally found a good breakfast/brunch place near Streeterville, that won't break the budget. West Egg feels like a small-town diner, imported into a big-city location. And when it's early in the morning, that's just what the doctor ordered. When you enter the building, you might be a little concerned depending on what door you walk through. They're going through construction right now so one of the entrances seems like it's a for-sale property, still undergoing renovations(much like the rest of Chicago). Once you make it inside though you'll be pleasantly surprised to see quaint tables, friendly waitresses, and an unmistakable smell of eggs, pancakes and everything else breakfast. The menu is fairly normal size for a diner, featuring a wide variety of different pancakes, waffles, omelets, and other breakfast specials(many with, but also many without, egg). I got the Biscuits and Sausage Gravy, which came with home-fried potatoes, a sausage link, and two eggs cooked to my specifications. My friends got two omelets, and a California crepe(sort of like a very thin rolled omelet, but filled with avocado and other vegetables and topped with alfalfa sprouts). The food itself was all good, though the omelets seemed a little more dense and less fluffy than I usually prefer. The biscuits were flavorful, though they could have been fluffier. Quite enjoyed the sausage gravy, wish they could have spooned a little more of it on. Eggs were cooked perfectly and the homefries were crispy as well.  Granted, I was not wowed by West Egg, but I would come back here again.

We took some time to order, and were all surprised with just how fast our food came out. The service was quick, but not particularly pleasant or thoughtful.  Each of our orders looked lovely, but not one was all the way hot. I expected my Albuquerque style benedict to be lukewarm because it contained fresh avocado, and it was fine. The hollandaise was okay, and so was the overall construction of the dish. The other orders of french toast, scrambled eggs, and omelet, though, were also lukewarm. I was disappointed in the potatoes - not done enough, but I was pleased with the small side of fruit that came with the benedict.

2014-12-22,3.0,"Go West Young Man! West Egg Cafe is your standard, Greek breakfast diner in downtown Chicago, IL that serves traditional breakfast & lunch items. It's not winning awards or shooting for ""Best Breakfast Place in the City"" & isn't Zagat-rated like Yolk or some of the other breakfast places downtown, but it can hold its own. It's also not as expensive or gourmet either, but you can still get a solid breakfast at the West Egg. There used to be a West Egg location in the basement of The Daley Center Building where I once upon a time ago 1st worked as a young atty & I occasionally ate there & liked it. But that location closed awhile ago. This West Egg location serves up the same reliable, good breakfast too that I remember from the other one. I ordered the ""Heartland"" which is egg whites scrambled with diced veggies & comes with cheese on top but I had them hold it. It also comes with a bran muffin, but I asked my server if I could sub it for 1 blueberry pancake & without hesitation he said ""Sure, I can do that."" That's what I love about Chicago service if you want something, ask & you shall receive!  My egg white scrambler was moderate-sized but filling & tasty with diced tomatoes, zucchini, green onions & sliced mushrooms. The egg whites were diced up too but nice & fluffy. An added bonus was the complimentary, small cup of fresh fruit & sliced tomatoes that they put on my plate that wasn't listed as part of the dish. I would get this dish again. The blueberry pancake was large, about the size of my plate. The berries were in the batter which I like, but it was really flat ""like a pancake"" lol. I prefer a thicker, fluffier cake but it did have a good flavor. Also, I wasn't charged for the swap, so kudos!  FYI: I got my own pitcher of icy, lemon water & a carafe of coffee which I appreciate, thus no waiting on refills! A caffeinated Gem is a happy Gem! Service here is sufficient, quick & accommodating. The restaurant isn't scoring awards for coolest decor either, kinda stuck in the early 90s-era kinda look. You're not gonna get organic coffee, award-winning eggs or ginormous portions at West Egg either. But if you're lookin' for a no-frills, old-school, reliably good breakfast where you won't have to drop a whole lotta dough, I wouldn't hesitate telling you to go to West Egg Cafe if you're nearby.",0.996,0.79,0.168,0.041,0.4574989824989825

However, after a particularly grueling yoga session, my sister and I decided to take our chances and give it a try. By some stroke of luck we actually got right in and were given two seats at the breakfast bar! Our server was efficient and courteous and immediately offered us coffee and juice and then let us be with the surprisingly extensive menu. Usually I would have gone with the breakfast burrito, but I didn't want to completely negate my work out that morning so I ordered the Bacado omelet instead. I loved that there were so many Mexican themed dishes on the menu, usually restaurants throw in one dish and call it good but West Egg Café takes their spice seriously! The Bacado was excellent, or dare I say ""eggs-celent"" with a delicious combination of bacon, guacamole, chilies, and salsa, all topped with an ample amount of Cholula; just what I needed. The potatoes were great and there were so many of them my sister had to help me finish. Now that I have had the food at West Egg Café, I would totally wait in line to have it again, and to try that breakfast burrito!

In general we had a positive experience. We first sat in a window seat directly in the morning sun. After the temp went way up, the waiter moved us with no issue. We both had variations on the eggs benedict theme. Mine was Albuquerque Turkey with loads of avocado and turkey.  The eggs were perfectly poached and sitting right on top. Instead of the potatoes I doubled up on the fruit. In most places that means a lot of honey dew. The large cup had ripe canelope and grapes. Very nice. My wife had the regular EB and was not disappointed. In both, the muffin was under toasted so ask for it well done if you like it firm and not raw.  The only downside to the experience was the busboy banging dishes into the tub right next to us and the tired looking interior. Without that it rated 4 stars.",0.8421,0.84,0.1,0.06,0.5420543224891051

We got to West Egg and while the restaurant was busy we got seated right away. We did not see our waiter for awhile after being seated, my coffee mug was not clean and had something sticky all over it.  Thankfully a bus boy had come by and I asked him to replace it with a clean mug. The waiter barely spoke English and he was very hard to understand. We ordered and our food was out in under 5 mins. My friend order blueberry pancakes and they do not use fresh blueberries, they use a syrupy blueberry mess. They didn't bring out any regular syrup or butter at first, we had to wait about 10 mins before our waiter even came back to the table. I ended up asking the same bus boy who got me a clean mug for both. I ordered a diced veggie skillet and while the eggs were good, the potatoes were hard and under cooked along with the veggies. The veggies consisted of mushrooms and zucchini only. The mushrooms were not cooked at all and did not taste fresh and the zucchini was extremely hard. I had to ask for more butter for my english muffin as they only brought one dish for the pancakes. Neither of us even finish 1/2 of our food because it was horrible. We waited for our check for another 15 mins after we were done because our waiter was no where to be found. When we went to pay the woman behind the counter was extremely rude, didn't even acknowledge us just held out her hand for the receipt and waved her hand for the credit card, without saying anything. She was having a conversation with a waiter very loudly and complaining about how another table didn't pay, which was not professional when you have customers in front of you. She threw down the check found a pen for me and after I signed snatched the check. No thank you for coming, have a great day, she never said one word to us. I would have rather not ate or waited an hour someplace good. There are so many great breakfast places in the area, so please, go and try another place and skip this one.

I got the Rod's Country Steak, which is essentially supposed to be country fried steak. It doesn't say it on the menu but most everything came with country fried potatoes (inclusive of my dish). Mine also came with your choice of prepared two eggs. I asked for over medium, and was given over easy. The eggs were runnier than i'm used to but were good quality eggs - fresh, season-free, so it gave me the chance to add my own salt and pepper. It also came with a buttered, toasted english muffin, which was tasty with the right amount of crunchy. The potatoes were a bit bland. And the country fried steak was even blander. The crust was soggy so I didn't get the satisfying crunch or tastes. The gravy was on the bland side and made me feel bad for eating the calories when I didn't enjoy it as much as I should have. It was $9.50, which isn't bad at all! Except that I would have tried a number of other things if I knew my dish would've turned out this way. Still want to come back to try other things since it's reasonably priced and the service is great, but will probably try other places first.

2013-04-02,3.0,"Brunch places are pretty popular in this neighborhood, and West Egg Cafe is no exception to what seems to be a rule. After striking out at a couple other places, we came here before we had to check out at the Doubletree across the street. While there were a decent number of people waiting, we must have been one of the only parties of 2 - so we got seated at a table by the entrance after only waiting a few minutes. The service here is pretty standard, although given how busy it is, we did wait a little longer at times, particularly when we were looking to have our dishes taken at the end. While the menu here is definitely geared towards the 'egg' part of breakfast (at least in how things are named), pretty much anything you can imagine having for brunch is listed - omelettes, pancakes, French toast, eggs served many different ways, and so forth. I ended up going with the corn beef hash with eggs. Over-easy eggs were pretty much as expected (hard to really change those up), while the corned beef hash was very standard - a proper, greasy mix of corned beef and small potatoes. You also get an English muffin on the side. I had a bite of my fiancee's 'Bacado', which is basically an omelette that has bacon and avocado...pretty solid overall. I also got a 'small' glass of OJ, except it was larger than most brunch places serve, and for $2.75 and being fresh-squeezed, it's a good deal. One thing I noticed is that the portions here are pretty large, so if you do manage to finish all of your food, there's a good chance you'll be stuffed. That said, prices are very reasonable (as far as I remember, everything is under $10), and they do all the staples of brunch well.

Well, this might be a  slight exaggeration, but all I wanted in the world was a BIG glass of ice water.

I enjoyed some Greek fritatta (eggs plus feta plus spinach, minus olives) and opted for the fruit instead of potatoes.

I ordered the California Crepe, which was described as ""broccoli, cheese, avocado, mushroom and fluffy eggs inside a thin sweet crepe"". What I got was a sort of omelet base with a rubbery crepe inside instead of outside, stuffed with raw broccoli florets and mushrooms, and some lukewarm partially melted cheese. What?! They could've at least cooked the veg...nothing's worse than crunchy, slightly warm broccoli in the morning. Boyfriend got the Bacado omelet, which would've been inoffensive if they had used actual bacon. Instead he got some kind of simulated-bacon mush. The potatoes were very bland and kind of mushy. Service was bad too. No one asked us how the food was, and our waitress only showed up to take our order and drop off the check.

I call it heart attack in a bowl.     It was crispy bacon, crumbled spicy sausage, potatoes, onions, green peppers, ham, topped with scrambled eggs and a melted blend of cheddar, mozzerella and smoked gouda cheese.    My belly was in paradise, almost made it hard to walk back to the hotel.     The coffee is light and mild, the perfect blend.   The service was sort of lacking and it did take a while to get our food, but due to their business at the time and we had a large group, I will give them the benefit of the doubt.     All in all,  great breakfast place and will definately be patronized again.",0.9474,0.858,0.098,0.044,0.4917063492063492

On Sunday, better service and better meal, but still just ok.  This time I got blueberry pancakes with a side order of ham.  Pancakes have the blueberries in them, so that's a definite plus!  However, the slice of ham I got was served on top ot 2 slices of tomato and some green onions, so that's all I tasted.  I would have sent it back, but I could not get the waitress's attention.

I don't want to sound ungrateful, but I really can't eat Gran Luxe anymore because that is all they ever order at work for lunch these days.  I really do appreciate the free lunches, but given I have a wedding coming up in less than 4 months, the free lunches aren't quite my friend right now. Enter: West Egg Cafe.   I couldn't decide what I wanted for lunch today, but I knew I wanted something light and healthy.  I voiced my dilemma to a co-worker and she chimed in, ""Why don't you try West Egg Cafe!""  *light bulb*  Of course, breakfast for lunch sounded perfect! I made the quick walk over there from work and was brightly greeted by a gentleman at the register when I walked in.  I don't think I have met a happier host than him.  He took my order and even confirmed that I wanted my veggies sautéed, not steamed or raw, which to me is going to extra step when not a lot of people do during the lunch rush. The restaurant wasn't overly packed.  I went there around 12:45pm on a Wednesday.  My order was out in less than ten minutes - I did carry out. I got to work and immediately opened up my container and was hit by the wonderful steam and scent of my egg white scramble with jack cheese and a side of sautéed spinach and broccoli.  Note:  they seem very accommodating about substituting ingredients which I was happy about.  Normally the egg white scramble comes cheese-less and served on tomato wheels.  It also comes with an English muffin.  Another note:  if you don't want your English muffin pre-buttered be sure to let them know.  I didn't know it came with butter and put additional on before I realized my healthy lunch was suddenly a little-less healthy. The eggs were perfectly fluffy and the veggies sauteed without being soggy and wilted.  I only had to add pepper to the dish - the salt was perfect. I will admit that the meal was a bit pricey for egg whites and veggies ($7.77), but nonetheless very satisfying.  Besides, you can get a lot worse in the city for lunch for that price so I'd rather spend it here.  And the host (I will have to get his name next time) had a smile and personality that totally made my afternoon.",0.9969,0.789,0.178,0.033,0.5089052481909626

Eggs are in so many forms on this menu it's impossible to keep track of. For hangovers, omelettes with some form of sausage or bacon are required. And preferably lots of cheese.

In any event, West Egg is a charming little breakfast place on Fairbanks/Columbus Dr.  Unpretentious facade, way more spacious on the inside than it appears to be from the outside.  There is a breakfast bar area to your left when you enter, flanked by the kitchen.  The right side is a large dining area with huge windows overlooking the street.  The restaurant is very bright and airy as a result and you get to people watch at the same time :) Lots of merchandise and memorabilia.  This place must be famous for being on some show or something - can't imagine why else someone would want a West Egg T-shirt O_o. I had a Feta frittata - without the kalamata olives (I dislike olives in general).  It was delicious, with just the right amount of feta cheese and tomatoes and spinach.  Comes with a side of potatoes (wish they had hash browns instead) and a toasted English muffin. My colleague had an omelet and liked it very much as well.  Don't remember the exact type of omelet but it looked pretty substantial and came with the same sides. Fresh squeezed orange juice and good coffee.

It's turkey breast and avocado over an English muffin with a poached egg on top and the classic hollondaise sauce.  Usually I hate lots of sauce, especially the rich hollondaise but this dish was drenched in sauce and I didn't even notice.  There was a lightness to the sauce and the turkey and avocado definitely put this dish on the light side.  It was absolutely delicious!! Boyfriend got sausage gravy and eggs and that was yummy too.  I will definitely be back the next time I visit Chicago.  But before then, I will dream of the ATB while brunching in NYC.

West Egg Cafe is a great place to go if you're downtown and are looking for something delicious and pretty fast, too. I went here on Valentine's day. As we entered the cramped hallway/waiting area, we were dismayed to see about 15 other couples who had the same idea. When we gave our name to the host, he said that the wait would be no more than 13 minutes. Very...um....precise. But, he was right! He was calling names faster than an auctioneer, so it only took us about 10min to get a table. We had to sit in the strangely isolated back room, though, which didn't bother us much as we were more interested in food than atmosphere. I had a classic eggs/sausage/bread product/potato product kind of breakfast. Everything was delicious, though my eggs were a bit undercooked for my liking. I like how the breakfasts come with an English muffin instead of toast. Also, the sausage was probably the best I'd ever had (that's what she said). All in all, a satisfying meal. Oh, and they give you a pitcher of water and a thingy of coffee at your table, which is a mark of a good breakfast place, IMO.

It was like being put at the kids table. Degrading. But oh yes, my first time at the West Egg, the girl I brought to the ""obligatory breakfast after"" had the Blues and Cashews pancakes and she was not just happy with them, she was amazed by them.

Where West Egg Cafe separates itself from the pack: in their variety of egg dishes. This little Streeterville nook is 50% well-named. The only thing it's West of is Lake Michigan and the River East AMC Theater, but 95% of the dishes here contain egg in some format. Think Bubba's shrimp obsession in Forrest Gump, and switch shrimp with eggs. ""You can poach it, fry it, boil it...there's egg whites, frittatas...pan fried, deep fried, stir fried. There's steak and eggs, pork chop and eggs, omelettes, egg skillets...that's, that's about it."" Where this place falls short: Eggs Benedict. Granted, I'm a huge eggs benny fan, but there are enough brunch places in Chitown that a classic brunch staple like this should NOT go unmastered. If you've tried the buttery mistake that they call hollandaise, you'll understand why it's such an egregious error. A breakfast no-no, if you will. The albuquerque Turkey benedict? Just because a place totes avocado does not mean they use it properly. If you're looking for a cheap greasy breakfast to soak up your hangover rather than induce your gag reflex, ""the Benediction"" is one section of the menu to shy away from.

The plain pancakes, however, were AMAZING.  They were huge (the diameter of the 3 pancakes fit perfectly in the styrofoam takeout box, approximately 7"").  I just read online that they use whole wheat flour, which explains the dark specks, and the texture was almost like potato pancakes.  The pancakes are slightly different than the rubbery kind you get at IHOP, but so good!
