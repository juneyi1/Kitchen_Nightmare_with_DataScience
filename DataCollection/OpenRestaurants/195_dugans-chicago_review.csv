The bar has multiple open areas including the front, where you can order from their daily specials (as low as $3.50 for a draft) and partake in some of their freebies.  While they don't serve any food per se, they do offer FREE popcorn (plus your choice of seasoning including garlic parmesan, cheddar, etc.) and HOT DOGS. I certainly appreciate these especially after you've had a drink or two. I also learned that Chicago folks don't add ketchup to their hot dogs. Pardon me for being out of state. The free snacks and cheap drinks makes me come back. Only real issue I have is the extremely loud music in the back even when there aren't a lot of people, and the inconsistency with their shots.

2014-02-09,1.0,"Around 8p last night I met 2 of my friends for a few beers. The bar at that point was basically empty with the exception of maybe 5 or 6 other patrons and (I think) an English Bulldog. We sat at the bar where we assumed it would be fairly easy to get served, but we were sadly mistaken.  First off, when I arrived the bartender watched me sit down. However, she didn't feel obligated to ask me if I wanted a drink. She just stood there. FInally, after about 5 minutes we have to literally flag her down even though she was standing about 4 feet from us so that I could ask for a taste of the 5 Rabbits beer. She brought me the taste, set it on the bar nowhere near me so that one of my friends had to reach over and hand it to me, then walked away. She didn't wait to see if I wanted a glass or if I wanted something different. After a few more minutes we had to literally flag her down again, even though she was still standing about 4 feet from us so I could actually order. Once again, she brought me the beer and set it where one of my friends had to reach over to get it and hand it to me. Secondly, my friend ordered a Guinness. She poured a glass, set it down by the tap and walked away. Finally, about 5 minutes later we had to ask the other bartender what was going on. That bartender walked over to the other and asked if the Guinness sitting by the tap was ours. She indicated that is was and seemed to say something like ""f*uck it"" and walked away. The other bartender actually had to go retrieve the beer and bring it over. Finally, two other friends arrived. She actually asked if they wanted something to drink and in the middle of my friend saying ""yeah, I'll have..."" she walked away. Again, we had to literally flag her down even though she was standing about 4 feet form us. I don't know if this is typical of this place, but I assure you if it is my friends and I won't be back. This bartender seemed more interested in staring off into space, eating her veggie tray, talking to one specific guy at the bar and taking smoke breaks than she was at serving us.  This bartender is a terrible advertisement for this place and I think the owners would have been embarrassed to witness this last night.",0.9879,0.853,0.112,0.035,0.3714714714714714

Since it was drinking paid for by a vendor, the liquor was flowing like the tears of a woman after watching the movie ""The Notebook."" (I cried too).  Anywho, the place is more ""divey"" then trendy, which was cool. They have a section near the back where they setup some free food. Tonight was hotdogs and the popcorn machine was popping some delicious salty popcorn for those wanting to soak up the booze. Also in the back was an electronic dartboard and a jukebox. Overall, nothing special about the place that sets it apart. The crowd looked more like regular people, versus yuppies, which I wouldn't find at a dive anyways. BATHROOM REVIEW - the bathrooms are located near the jukebox at the back of the place. In the bathroom, there are two urinals, a sink, and a stall. Peering in the bathroom stall, it was dingy, but what you expect for a dive? The door look somewhat securely so no risk of someone walking in on you while your dropping a friend off. Overall, clean, the best part I like is that the door swung outward, meaning, once you've taken care of emptying your bladder, no real need to grab a paper towel and touch the handle to open it; You can just push the door open and be on your drunken way. SIT or SQUAT? This was a tough one -- but like all bars, I would never place my bar ass on something that some other drunkard has. I'll SQUAT.",0.9367,0.795,0.121,0.084,0.4294452075702076

Asking for some darts for the dart boards, the looks on their faces were as if I just asked them to donate a kidney. Didn't feel welcomed at all. I used to be in the industry, moreover, at an Irish pub similar to Dugan's. So I truly understand the craziness of St. Pat's Day.

For me, it's along the lines of ""one of these things is not like the other."" However, it's not going anywhere or should for that matter. I can give my Procrustean side a rest and hand it an honest review based on its performance. I went in on a low-traffic day. This is very fortunate, because it won't house that many people. Overcrowded bars are not for me. If I have no elbow room, I'm off to find something better. During St. Patrick's Day, I looked in the window and wasn't about to set foot in it.    There was nothing remarkable about the bartender. However, it's the first time I was offered a White Castle slider by one. I have zero idea what that's all about. Either you have food or you don't. Bringing in food from somewhere else misses the mark (i.e. the bar that offers microwaveable pizza to drunks at 2:00 in the morning). Surprisingly, they didn't carry the Sam Adam's seasonal (currently Noble Pils). They also had changed the tap on one of the Bell's beers, which is a small irritation. If it's not on the drink list, take it off immediately. I ended up playing the ""guess which beers we still have"" game with her. Sigh. The bar is set up in a fairly common manner.

She was busier on her phone taking calls and sending text messages then taking care of the customers. It was difficult to get a drink. When I was finally able to get her attention she was rude. She is in the wrong line of work.   The next episode that I experienced at Dugans was not much better. It was during the Bears Packer game. The bartender was so busy, the customers were waiting forever for their drinks. There was another employee present the manager, who was too busy trying to sell something rather then jumping behind the bar to help her serve the customers. I don't know  what owners are thinking but that girl Madelyn is not good for business. And, the manager needs to get her priorities in order.

And the Guinness was in a frosted beer cup, like you had at frat parties in college?! Nine-freaking dollars?!  So of course, when that piddly portion of Guinness had, um, run its course, I made for the bathroom. Two words: Guh. Ross. Disgusting. One of the toilets was very full - nearly overflowing; the floor was covered in some sort of wetness - don't wanna know - and the remaining stall was working overtime...and as such, had no toilet paper and I had to jiggle the handle to make sure it flushed properly. The line had wound out about 12 people into the bar by the time I was headed back to my spot, a good 15 minutes after I'd left.  The most positive thing about the place was the diversity of the people - again, I don't know if that's how it is all the time, but it was cool on Saturday - and the barkeeps are efficient, friendly, fast and do not look as though they practice any bullshit or passive-aggressive shenanigans. Good stuff.  As I am rarely down in the UIC/Greektown neighborhood, I doubt I will be making a pilgrimage back to this particular bar, but it wasn't terrible.

2007-03-29,3.0,"So after a swell time at Venus, our dimiNishing group wanted to go out for a nearby nightcap. In Greektown, that ironically meant an Irish pub down the block, by the name of Dugan's.  It's sort of what you'd expect, a bunch of broguish characters, mixed in with a few suits, drinking the night away. This isn't a fancy place by any means, but if you want to have some pints with some friends, it's definitely a cool enough spot to get merry. The bartenders - both female - seemed to be out of place and at the same time perfect for the guys I noticed at the end of the bar ordering 2 shots of Jaeger each for themselves, this being around midnight on a Wednesday. All in all, good times, and I'd imagine as the weekend draws closer the place would get more rowdy and drunken, with a solid dose of testosterone thrown in for good measure. Note: Their popcorn must have crack-based butter on it, it's very addictive. Overall, probably 3.5 stars, wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but if it was your local watering hole, you certainly could do a lot worse.",0.9826,0.81,0.161,0.028,0.3917768959435625

I realized she was JOKING and was actually a playing off the fact that she was a cop!  Turns out, not only is this an after work crowd, but also a gathering spot for the local police officers.  After a few good laughs, and a couple of beers it was time to take my role-playing self back to the apt. LOL Overall, the place isn't too bad. It's close to where I live, so that does give it the convenience factor, but being 21 I felt a little out of place.  Drinks were relatively cheaper than the surrounding areas, and the bartenders were very friendly.  Great service, good food... probably going back!
