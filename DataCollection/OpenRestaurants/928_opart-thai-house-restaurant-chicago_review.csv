I was a bit turned off when the waitress snuck from behind me and grabbed my entree and started walking away when I was still eating it!  She did not even ask if I was done.  I had to ask her to bring it back.    Overall, I think this place has good flavors but they are stingy with portion sizes, no rice with entree, and they do NOT listen to your request for spiciness.  Why give us 4 options if you are going to cook it mild anyway?",0.9757,0.842,0.124,0.034,0.5061576354679802

So, you get about a tablespoon of peanut sauce -- with the same $1.00 price tag.  Has to be a mistake, right? New person working in the kitchen? Nope!  I called and the person on the phone said that management had changed the ""protocol"" for the size of the side order to make it smaller. Cool.

The Tiger Cry stood out as far as appetizers and the Fried Banana (banana in an egg roll wrapper) was the dessert winner. We passed our entrées around family style, so I had the opportunity to try a lot of different dishes and get a good idea of what I'd want to order again when I return. I was set on ordering the Tiger Cry after I saw it referenced in a few Yelp reviews and found it to be even better than I was expecting. I could have easily ordered 2 portions and made this its own meal. We couldn't decide what else to get, so we went with the Sampler Platter and it was OK. My favorite part was the Crab Rangoon, so I'd get that again. The Fried Shumai were alright, but I could skip them next time. The Egg Roll and the Fried Shrimp Spring Roll didn't do much for me but were enjoyed by others. We got Fresh Spring Rolls, too. The sauces that accompanied the appetizers were kind of what really had people talking since they were very good and went well on just about anything you put them on. We all ordered something completely different or slight variations of entrées. One person got the Peanut Sauce Lover, which was one of my favorites, especially the sauce. She ordered it medium-hot, which I was able to handle, though it did open up my sinuses and had me tearing up a little bit. For others, this was a bit too hot. Everyone else mostly got mild or medium spiciness. I ordered Gaeng Panang with pork and medium. Another friend got Gaeng Panang with beef and mild. I'm pretty sure another was Pad See-Iew with chicken, which was very good. Another favorite was another Yellow Curry with coconut milk, Gaeng Musaman. And there was a finely chopped beef meal called Pad Ka-Prao that had ginger and was very spicy to me even though it was ordered medium. Be warned the the Thai Custard is not the way most would think of a custard. It's much more like a hot, mushy cake.

But once you find yourself inside, you'll realize the restaurant is actually quite large, with ample seating and archways that lead you to more seats inside restaurant.  Service was great, my fiance and I tried their thai tea and it was definitely legit. For appetizers, we had their crab rangoon which was just amazing, fresh, perfectly crispy and very well portioned. For the main course we had the panang curry and pad see ew -- the curry was hands down my favorite, with the perfect amount of flavor and heat, moist chicken a bed of rice.  Probably my only gripe was that they charged $1 extra for rice, and they are a bit pricier than the other restaurants I've been to... but I'm sure they know they've got a great thing going.

My wife is none of the above, still a carnivore. Finding restaurants to fit our needs wouldn't be possible without Yelp, so here is my official thanks to Yelp shout out.

The menu looked great, more importantly the seats were comfortable and the ac was pumping cool deliciousness into the air.  We started with 2 orders of spring rolls, and our server had no problem with our request to leave the eggs out. The rolls were served with some sliced jalapenos, which I thought was a nice touch. They were delish and very filling. I ordered the curry fried rice with tofu. I wish I could have ordered it with chicken, but my daughter was watching. Back story. I used to live in Miami FL before moving to Charlotte 8 years ago. I used to frequent a Thai joint that served curry fried rice. I never found a rice dish anywhere in my travels that equaled what Sea Siam in Miami served. Until I went to Opart. One word? Fantasticallydelish! It was fried to perfection, and I was blown away by the flavor. If I could have ordered to go as well I would have. My girls were very happy with their meals too, our waiter was fantastic.

There are so many selections on the menu and the names are so Thai that you might just need those numbers preceding each item to order your meal.  On a recent visit I asked our server which she would choose between two dishes.  She immediately said I should go with the khao nar ped, and it turned out to be a good choice.  The pieces of roast duck were flavorful, and the Chinese broccoli and rice made for a simple yet fine meal.  My friend ordered the tom yum koong with a medium level of spiciness.  This is a large vat of Thai hot and sour soup with shrimp, mushrooms, lemon grass and lime juice.  I took one trial sip and although it was flavorful, it was too spicy for me.  My friend gleefully enjoyed the soup, though in the end she could not finish it all because of the generous overall serving size.  The tab was very reasonable, perhaps mainly because we did not order anything else.  The BYOB policy also helps to keep the costs down when you dine at Opart Thai.",0.986,0.87,0.122,0.008,0.3894279100529101

I tried calling a few times tonight. I got a busy signal a couple of times, which was no problem; it's a Sunday, the Cubs are in the NLCS so everyone's watching the game, I get it. I just called back. However, when I finally had someone answer the phone, I was put on hold immediately for approximately 10 minutes. I was then taken off hold, as I heard activity in the background and people speaking to one another, and I called out ""Hello!"" on the phone for about 2 minutes hoping someone would hear me. I know that these times are correct since the phone says how long the calls are and it was 12 minutes total. Clearly no one was hearing me, so I hung up. When I called back, I got a busy signal again so I waited a few minutes to call back. I finally got through after my third call or so. The woman who answered simply said ""hold please"" and put me immediately on hold. Not only is this one of my biggest pet peeves (being put on hold without being able to say a word), but given that I had just spent 12 minutes on hold I wasn't about to wait again. Their food certainly is not that good. This happens far too often when I call Opart Thai--there's been some variant of this experience the last two or three times I've tried to order, which is why I have vetoed it when my partner has suggested it. So I'm simply not going to bother any longer.

It was exactly as I remembered it, but I have made some personal changes since then, even if the restaurant ostensibly has not. I now follow a vegan diet as much as possible, and I am also a more adventurous eater in terms of flavor profiles, levels of spiciness and ordering things blindly. I used to come here and get the chicken pad thai and crab rangoon, every. single. time. - they were wonderful! But now, in my 'old age', I prefer to always try to order something new when I go out. I asked our server for a recommendation given the above two requirements (veg and new to me), and she said no problem, she could do any dish vegetarian (reassuring, since I was guessing that a lot of sauces might be fish-based). She suggested Pad Ped Paak, which was kind of non-descriptly listed as ""Sauteed mixed vegetables and hot peppers with choice of [protein].""  Delicious! The sauce was more of like a salty broth, but it was so savory that I could have eaten down an entire bowl of the stuff. The veggies were so colorful and perfectly cooked, not soggy: broccoli, cauliflower, peapods, cabbage, bell peppers, chili peppers, tomatoes (...?), baby corn and onion (I think). Perfect recommendation for me. My dining partner got the Hot & Spicy Seafood Combo and also loved his food. He ordered it very spicy and got through most of it, but he said it made his scalp start to sweat!

When this former neighbor stopped by to visit us we decided to stop in and try this place so she could re-live her heaven. Here is what we ordered: Chicken Satay: I'm a vegetarian so I didn't try this.  But the sweet cucumber salad it comes with and the peanut sauce it also comes with were fabulous. Spicy Fried Tofu: All three of us some how missed that it comes with chicken on top (we still swear it wasn't on the menu, but who knows....)  When it came out with chicken, we asked if we could have it re-done.  In hind-sight it didn't matter.  It tasted strange. Sort of like dirty feet. Not one of us liked it.  (Ant the neighbor I mentioned is not a picky eater!)  This pretty much went un-touched. Pad Thai: This was my order. It was Ok. Nothing out of this world. I secretly kept wanting more ""sauce"" or flavor or something. If there was soy sauce on the table I probably would have dumped some on.  Despite thinking it was only OK, I certainly hoovered down the leftovers for breakfast the next day. Vegetable Fried Rice: This was very bland. I certainly wanted more flavor on this. It was OK.  Nothing bad, just not real exciting. Pad Prik King: this was my husbands selection.  When I tasted it I wasn't crazy about it, but I also had nothing against it. But he said he thought it was really good and he cleaned his plate. Gaeng Panang:  this was the neighbors dish that she ordered two of last time she ate here. I gave her sauce a taste and it was very good.

Also some of the best wonton soup I have had in ages -- you can tell the dumplings are truly homemade and, even though this is not a traditional Thai soup, they do a great job and definitely add a Thai flair with their addition of ground chicken. I've heard the Kao Soi is a must order here, and I would like to try that the next time.  Another BIG PLUS in my book is, they know spicy! Nothing is more disappointing to me when you specify ""very spicy"" for a dish you are ordering, and they wimp out.   Too many Thai (and other ethnic restaurants that specialize in spicy cuisine) tend to tone down their spice levels for an American palate. So, when I specify ""very spicy"" or let's say a ""10"" on a scale of 1-10, it tends to fall way short of what I really want. Not the case at Opart. When I ask for it a 10 -- it probably comes out a 15! So, if you like spicy the way I do, be sure to specify (particularly with the Penang/curries and Tom Yum -- it is out of this world good) and if you are not a spice-lover, fear not, there has always been an abundence of great choices on the menu for those in our party who prefer dishes on the mild side.  Note on my star ratings: only reason I am not giving Opart five stars, is that five stars, for me, are really reserved for best in class and the absolute *best* Thai restaurant in America, that I've experienced so far, is Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas.

2014-12-30,4.0,"So, I grew up in Seattle, where Thai and Vietnamese food are about as common as fried chicken joints in Chicago--every major intersection and strip mall.  Moving to the Midwest has been a painful transition with a dearth of even passable Thai to be found in Indiana; when the hubby and I made it to Chicago, I finally had my Thai cravings mostly satisfied by Opart.  Now, it's not as good as the Thai food in Thailand (which is amazing), but it is decidedly the best I've found in Chicago and indeed in the Midwest.  The fact that it's also very reasonably priced is a big help, too, in a city where $15 for a greasy Chinese takeout dish is not considered abnormal.  Here's the thing with Opart: you have to know how to modify the items you like to your preferences. For example:  --some have complained that the curries lack veggies.  I have tried every one on the menu, and I agree if you get them as printed on the menu they seem short of veggies.  The reason? In Thailand they usually do not add many veggies to curry.  BUT: you must know that for $2 extra you can add ""extra veggies"" to any of them.  They will also let you specify which kinds of veggies you want.  I usually get Thai eggplant and green beans added to red curry (which comes with just meats and bamboo normally).  The effect of this $2 addition is that you get a container of curry that is literally twice as big as the normal order, with tons of veggies.  You can also add extra meat as desired for a similar charge.  Adding veggies means paying $10.99 for a 32oz red curry full of meat and delicious Thai veggies, which I consider a great deal.  Once I discovered this, my issues with their menu were permanently solved, as red curry is sort of an addiction for me and the lack of veggies was my only complaint with their curries. --Pad Thai: my main issue with their Pad Thai is that ordering takeout, there is no option for spice.  They make it *bland* for the Midwestern palate as a default. UGH! You have to specify that you want it with spice in the comments or by being very clear with the waitress, or it will be boring.  Just let them know you want it hotter.  I do wish they provided it with the traditional bean sprouts (they substitute shredded cabbage), but I understand why they don't (sprouts have a terrible reputation for food poisoning).  With Opart, the best menu items in our eyes are: Yum Neur beef salad, Tom Yum Gai/Tom Kha Gai, Yum Woon Sen, Tiger Cry (same beef as the Yum Neur salad, no veggies), Panang or Red Curry with extra veggies.   Opart is real Thai food, so expect that, and order accordingly.  Portions are sufficient but not enormous.  Pseudo-Chinese dishes are not as good as the more authentic Thai dishes. Also, they seem more accurate at takeout/delivery than in the restaurant.  It's usually super busy on Friday and Saturday nights and that may be part of why the in-house service seems to make mistakes more often than the people getting the takeout/delivery together.  There's usually one guy in charge of all the takeout in the restaurant, and that seems to keep those orders well organized, as it is always quick and only once have I had anything missing in my order (and it was only one box of rice, out of maybe 30 orders in the last two years).

2014-12-21,5.0,"We really loved our time at Opart Thai. They have the expertise, the experience, and the means to deliver a well-rounded meal. The food is in the top five for Thai in the Chicagoland area; however, because of the ambiance, service, and price, I'd say that they're the best! They have the space and decor to accommodate many diners at once. It feels ethnic - perhaps a hodgepodge of authentic artwork and statues mixed with kitsch and a little well-loved functionality. For example, the tables and chairs are functional but are neither out-dated nor trendy. The restaurant is divided into at least three intimate rooms, each seating about 15 guests. Opart Thai has a staff that are good at their jobs. They know the menu, Thai food, and they can deliver a pleasant meal. What I mean is that you can expect to be greeted promptly upon entering the restaurant, have questions thoroughly answered, get solid recommendations, and have a well-timed delivery of food that is quickly cleared when finished. This isn't fine dining, but it's solid. The food is delicious. We got several dishes where two were clear stand-outs: the Tiger Cry and a recommendation by the server: Basil Noodles with Shrimp. We're likely to go that route again since we had such luck with the server suggesting an authentic Thai dish of which the chef was particularly talented in creating.  The final glory of Opart Thai is that it is BYOB. We went with our wine guy Allen who is particularly adept at bringing wonderful libations. Since Opart Thai is well equipped to handle guests, we felt comfortable lingering over our meal, drinks, and conversation. Anyway - you know what they say about BYOB? It makes the bill much more affordable!",0.9948,0.8,0.182,0.018,0.6099137931034483

My friend and I got seated immediately at 7 p.m. on a Wednesday, but about 30 minutes later people were waiting for a table. We went to Provenance before for a bottle of wine, because why go to the creepy, overpriced liquor store? We started with the peanut sauce spring rolls, which I absolutely loved. I am not a tofu fan but loved this...obviously the delicious peanut sauce helped. And you'll think by the price it will be a small app, but it isn't. We didn't even finish it. Now for the meehh...I'm a curry fan. Every time I go to a Thai place I get curry, and I mostly get the panang curry. Someone else said it was great here, but I was really disappointed. First, the portion size is small. How small do you say? Small enough that they serve it in a rectangular dish instead of bowl. Second, you have to pay $1 for rice. For curry. I mean, I only eat Thai about once a week so maybe I'm not an expert, but I thought rice always came with curry. Third, it was just okay. I've certainly had better panang curry- my favorite is from Rainbow Thai, which is just down the street.  Either way, I enjoyed my time there. Our waiter was very nice and we didn't wait long for food. I'll just plan on trying a different entree next time.  As far as the best Thai in the area?

Try the Miang Sa Wan appetizer. I get it spicy. It's perfect. If you don't like spicy food, perhaps you should order it medium flavor, but if you want the real deal... If you love Thailand and eat spicy food when you are there (not the the bland tourist food) you must try this. It's a flavor explosion of chilis, ginger, salty dried pork, lime, sweetness, sourness, crispy lettuce...  It's everything you want in a legit thai salad type of dish. A flavor explosion. I eat many things on this menu, but this is a must, every time. Miang Sa Wan. The real deal. There really is no other Thai food for me at this point.

Also, the squid was torched so the flavor of the squid tasted a little like gasoline. Pad Thai was pretty decent, but nothing outstanding about it, compared to the dish in other Thai restaurants. Thai Basil chicken we tried was a little salty with too much soy sauce flavor. I know this restaurant has a long tradition and has been known for a great Thai food.

We liked the Tiger Cry appetizer -- nicely grilled beef in a savory sauce (not spicy-hot). We ordered a papaya salad (Som Tum) and pork Pad Prik King medium-spicy; they were toward the hot end of the medium spectrum to my taste, to the point that the heat masked some of the flavor complexity (per my companion, we will order mild next time). Green beans in both the salad and the PPK were quite crisp (OK for me, but not my companion). I enjoyed a Thai iced coffee for dessert. Portions were ample for us, and the food looked good. There is no real waiting area, and Opart does not take reservations for small parties, so waiting for a table is awkward, especially since the take-out customers are also taking up space. There are three rooms at Opart; each seems cozy but not crowded too badly. Service was brisk, efficient and reserved. It's interesting that there are four Thai restaurants within a block of each other hereabouts. Of these, Opart is a clear winner for ambiance and quality of food. Royal Thai, a few blocks away on Montrose, has been our long-time area favorite, but at last visit it seemed like it may have changed either chef or owner, and the food really suffered.

2013-09-19,3.0,"Friday nights are always busy in the restaurant industry. My visit to Opart was impressive when I was told that my wait would be 20 minutes and it turned out to be less than 5 minutes. Maybe my host really did not know how long the wait would be and just threw out a number. After that, I was left with mixed feelings.  My friend and I started off with Tiger Cry, a delicious steak with a lemongrass sauce. Looks like everyone is talking about it. I can't say that it was terrible. It was definitely tasty. After eating out at so many restaurants in the last two years, I feel like there wasn't any flavor that I would say distinguishes Opart from other steaks done right. It was medium well to perfection, and it was very juicy. This is what I would expect out of steak. You could taste that grilled flavor, and for me, will forever encapsulate the essence of summertime in Chicago.  My dinner companion ordered the Green Curry Panang made with shrimp. First of all, I hate it when restaurants leave the tail on the shrimp when they make their dishes. I love that my friend is very conservative; and therefore over-the-top with his manners. It just looked odd to watch him remove each shrimp from the saucy dish, and use a spoon and a fork to separate the tail from the rest of the body. I find that just as silly as some people might think of others watching them pick up the sauce covered shrimp by the tail and bite the shrimp with enough grip so that all of the meat comes out of the tail, going straight into your mouth like a satay shrimp stick. My friend probably got a lukewarm mouthful of shrimp. The barbarian who eats food with their fingers has a fresh and hot piece of meat. Opart Thai House better recognize.  Secondly, my friend's panang was ordered from a location on the menu where the dishes aren't necessarily advertised as, ""you can order this spicy,"" but eat at enough Thai places and you definitely understand that this dish will always have a kick. I deliberately ordered from the spicy menu, located near the back pages. I even eyeballed the waiter and repeated myself twice, ""Make it spicy!"" I was very disappointed that he didn't listen. My squid dish tasted like it was thrown together with pre-packaged spicy noodle sauce, and served with only sautéed onions and green and red bell peppers to dress it up. My squid did not look like fresh squid, and it looked like it came out of a frozen bag.  There is a stereotype that all Asian restaurants have going: If you're Asian, they will make your food spicy. If you're Caucasian, your food will never come spicy. All Asians will tell you this. My friend is Chinese. I specifically told the waiter that I wanted my dish spicy. He delivered me jarred red pepper sauce that didn't even fall into the category of spicy. My friends Panang Curry? Spicy to perfection. I am that ""white girl"" that can handle a spicy dish; and you don't want to mess around when it comes to my order. If I say spicy, it better end up tingling my Eustachian tubes! How do I know my spicy squid wasn't spicy? I've been to enough Korean restaurants to know the difference.  Had the cook made my dish the right way, this place would have received 4 stars. I took another star away because I just felt that there wasn't anything different about Opart which made it stand apart from other Thai restaurants. If I come back here, I better get my dish spicy. I contemplated sending the dish back; but my friend and I both agreed that the cook would have probably copped an attitude and made the dish too spicy for anyone to bear. I was also concerned that the dish wouldn't be remade completely. I was worried that they would have just dressed up what they had already brought to my table.",0.9943,0.858,0.111,0.03,0.4275108225108225

Shrimp Toast - definitely something different, yet I don't know why 'Shrimp' is in this dish's name when there is no shrimp at all on top of the crostinis that came outta the kitchen. The toasted bread was rather greasy as well. Kee Mao Noodles - Decently spiced and taste, but not phenomenally unique from any other Thai restaurant. Portion size was small and meager.

As I have previously said, no Thai restaurants will ever get 5 stars from me unless it's in Thailand or my momma made it. That's because I'm Thai and I would want all of my favorite Thai dishes at one place cooked perfectly, and no place could ever provide that realistically. But in Chicago, Opart is as close to 5 stars as it gets in my biased little Thai foodie heart. I would give it 4.5 stars if I could. I've been to both locations numerous times and feel bad that I am just now reviewing. Sorry Opart!  Everything is authentic here. I have never ever been disappointed by the food. I bring all of friends here, especially those who have not had Thai food and everyone loves it! I even had one of my birthday dinner parties here. That's how much I love this place. My favorite dish here is Tiger's Cry (aka Crying Tiger). It's seared steak served sliced up with a special Thai sauce. No other Thai places in Chicago make it this good. Most don't even serve it because they don't have a grill and don't want to disgrace themselves (thanks guys). Those other places that do offer it but pan-sear the beef, shame on you! Tiger's cry should only be served char-grilled. It is called Tiger's cry because traditionally in Thailand, when it is cooked over a hot fire, the fat from the beef drips onto the coals and causes the fire to flare and reminiscent of a crying tiger! I always order this if I ever see it on any Thai menu and have always been disappointed. Except at Opart. Now I'm not saying it's a primo chunk of Chicago steakhouse beef, it's more like a skirt steak. But trust me, still super tasty! I also love their ground pork tom yum noodle soup. It's not on the menu. If you like the tom tum taste, and noodle soup dishes, this is a must try. Don't expect it to be like traditional tom yum soup. Try it and you'll see what I mean. It will be spicy. It just doesn't taste right when you order it mild. I'm a mild girl and I tolerate the heat just for these noodles. I also like all of their appetizers. The thai iced tea and iced coffee are also very yummy. I haven't had anything I didn't like!",0.9881,0.762,0.158,0.081,0.6269897959183675
2013-06-02,2.0,"A first trip into a new restaurant is almost like a first date in some respects Here's a post mortem of my first time with/at Opart Thai... The promise was great - the reviews, the reputation of a Thai mainstay in the city seemed rock solid The opportunity was perfect - after the beers, crowds and the rainy riot at Mayfest, piping hot Thai food at a place right across from the brown line seemed like the perfect ticket The actual experience fell flat - my friend and I were shown a table by the door and felt the draft of the wind with every activity in and out of the restaurant. Water droplets graced my shoulder every now and then from the cooling system in the ceiling above. And worst of all we waited - for a server to take our order, for the food to arrive and then for someone to recognize that we were ready to get the heck out of there!    A good first date is just the opening act but a bad one is a curtain call. There was some substance to Opart  - my Pad Ped Tuah (spicy sauteed green beans and Tofu smothered with Thai chilli) was good, infact I came home with some!  But there won't be a second time for me. I am finding other Thai fish in the Chicago sea!

2013-05-19,3.0,"After being recommended on Check Please and being somewhat close to our neighborhood, I deemed it necessary to try this place out.  We live in Roscoe Village and although the restaurants that we frequent there has been a huge reason we've stayed, its always a great idea to see if the grass is greener on the other side.  The BYOB is a great staple to this place (and almost necessary since I don't know of many Thai restaurants that aren't BYOB).  The location is right off of the Brown Line Western stop which is amazing.  The only way it could be better is if it was in the CTA Western Brown Line Station (which Dunkin Donuts was so that equally blew my mind).  We entered into the restaurant and the service was friendly and they did not hesitate to get you seated.  The decor was excellent and with the deep espresso wood paneling up the lower half of the wall, everything came together really well and it felt like you were in a classier restaurant.   For starters we had the peanut sauce spring rolls which sounded and tasted interesting although my wife was a little surprised by the texture of the peanut sauce.  It was more of a thick sauce as opposed to a sauce that had been drizzled on top of the spring rolls.  I had the chicken spring rolls with tangy sweet and sour sauce which was really good.  My main course was the Peanut Sauce Lover with Chicken which had the sauce texture and consistancy that was to be expected on the spring rolls.  The sauce had a prominent peanut flavor and the consistency was thin enough that you could laddle it onto the steamed rice to add another dimension to this dish.  Other than the chicken, cashews and peanut sauce, there wasn't much else to it except for the onions.  I don't mind onions, but with this dish I felt like there was too many.  They had both white and green onions mixed in and if I were to do my order over, I'd probably see if they could swap out the onions for some peppers.  The dish was spicy, but not toooo spicy so they nailed that. Final Verdict:  This place has a huge following, but I didn't think it was terribly different from other Thai places.  The convenience next to the El is huge though so I'd be back in the future.",0.9801,0.869,0.112,0.019,0.5247304582210243

I, a self-proclaimed green curry fanatic, would recommend Opart Thai's Gaeng Keow Waan with no reservations. My friend Michael, who enjoys the more basic Thai dishes, would call the barbecued pork sub-par. (I'd agree.) We'd both say the Shrimp Tempura, though standard, totally hits the spot.

I'm from Seattle, and their pad thai was great (even if I like thicker noodles they used thinner noodles than what I'm used to, it was still amazingly good). They know how to make food spicy for sure, in Seattle I have to ask for 5 stars but their mild/medium spicy levels are just perfection for me. Their crab rangoon is so mouth watering delicious, they make their crab cream cheese fried wontons so good, it melts in your mouth! Their pad see-iew is good but not worth ordering twice, I'm more into a sweeter version, the batch I ate there wasn't that sweet. Their Panang curry was good too, my boyfriend loved it but I thought it was ok. Their fried rice was kind of dried, felt kind of overcooked maybe but still edible, I'd probably get a different fried rice there. Their white rice was kind of squishy... Their service, well... I think they should have a waiting area where people can sit down while waiting at least lol! Their interior and exterior is nice and cozy.

2013-02-19,4.0,"After moving to the Lincoln Square area almost a year ago, many people highly recommended venturing to Opart to get our Thai fix. Luckily my boyfriend and I had a random Monday off together, so we decided to venture over to Opart for a late lunch. I was happy to see that they are open every day of the week for lunch and dinner, unlike many Asian restaurants in the city that are closed on Mondays and/or Tuesdays. We arrived around 2:30pm to a mostly deserted restaurant and we were promptly seated by the hostess and given menus to look over. We were mighty hungry so we decided to put in two of the appetizers while we reviewed their extensive menu of Thai offerings. One minor complaint about this restaurant is the general lack of description of their menu items. We had trouble discerning what some of the entrees actually were as they only had one or two different ingredients from the items above or below them. Regardless, here's what we feasted on for our mid-day meal: 1) Crab Rangoon: When this order of *eight* rangoons was placed in front of us, I questioned the decision that we made for two appetizers. Even though I had that shred of doubt, it was quickly forgotten as we inhaled the cream cheese fried goodness. The mixture was mostly cream cheese based, but it was well flavored with green onions and small bits of crab. The sauce was exactly what you would expect, sweet and tangy and perfectly complimentary to the rangoons.  2) Tiger's Cry (Tender beef charbroiled to perfection, served with homemade sauce): Amazing--a must for Opart. The beef was perfectly cooked and flavored with a nice char taste that permeated the meat. All the pieces were tender and easily could be cut with a fork.  The homemade sauce is also worth noting--it was sweet and spicy with what appeared to be pickled red onions and green onions. I can't rave enough about this dish, and I'm already craving more. 3) Gaeng Pet Ped (Red curry, roasted duck, pineapple and tomatoes sauteed in coconut milk): I really enjoyed this curry and the portion size wasn't ridiculous, which was nice in contrast to the very generous appetizers. The duck was tender, plentiful, and not chewy which set it above other Thai establishments that I've frequented. My only criticism about the duck was that they left the skin on and gave you rather large chunks of duck which made for a messy meal when trying to cut it into bite sized pieces with my spoon or fork. The skin was pretty soggy so it wasn't crispy which is the only way I like to eat duck/chicken skin. That aside, I was impressed that they used real tomatoes and pineapple versus canned. The curry itself was also very flavorful and was actually hot on the spicy scale (evidenced both in taste and with the abundance of red pepper flakes). Delicious. 4) Pad Ped Paak (Sauteed mixed vegetables and hot peppers with pork): My boyfriend got this dish so I can't comment too extensively on it. He seemed to enjoy it and also remarked that they cooked it to a hot temperature, as requested. The mixed vegetables ended up being broccoli, onions, pea pods, and a few other random bits. The pork was a bit overdone and the dish overall appeared to be quite oily. He remarked that the appetizers outshone his entree, and he'd be interested in trying something different next time. The service was prompt and quick and the restaurant was clean. I can't wait to come back and try some of the other offerings on their menu.

The first time I came here, I came for the cheap crab rangoon and Khao Soy (I loved this dish back home called Chiang Mai noodles which is another name for Khao Soy). It wasn't as good as what I was used to, which is why I haven't ordered it since. I usually get a crab rangoon craving every few months and it's always a good choice here being that it's pretty consistent each time. I've tried the drunken noodles which are alright. By the time I got home, they were pretty soggy and gross, which is probably my fault because I did get take out. I bet they taste much better in the restaurant. The Pad Thai is alright, but I'm not a big Pad Thai person so I can't judge.  My most recent order included the crab rangoon (like I said: consistency), an order of ""tiger cry,"" chicken satay, and chicken basil. The tiger cry is marinated beef with a special sauce. The menu said the beef was tender, but mine was more like beef jerky, but delicious nonetheless. I loved the spice marinade and the sauce was surprisingly really spicy. I highly recommend this dish as it will be on my order every time now. The chicken satay were pretty big pieces of chicken skewered and rubbed with curry powered. Opart's have a special taste which makes them stand out again the run of the mill Thai shack. However, this is where the happiness ended. I had a huge problem with my chicken basil. I'm a huge fan of this dish at any other Thai place because it is spicy, yet sweet and generally loaded with vegetables and basil. Opart's version was basically ground up chicken in a basil sauce. I looked online later and on the menu and it's called Pad Kra Praow. When I called up to order, I just asked if they made chicken basil because I didn't see it on the menu so I guess if I read the menu and description I would have known. My go to Thai dish used to be Panang curry until I had a bad encounter with it ending up all over my apartment (I think Satay on Diversey tried poisoning me). Opart Thai always had really good Panang and it was always loaded with veggies and was even spicy enough for my taste. For quick and yummy Thai this is my go to in Chicago. The staff is always super friendly and the food is done pretty quickly. The first time I came here, I actually got lost and Opart called me asking if I was going to pick up my food. When I told them what happened, they actually offered to stay a little after closing to save it for when I got there. I thought this was an extremely generous act and something that really exemplified how great their service really is.",0.9976,0.748,0.188,0.063,0.5601309523809523
2013-01-17,4.0,"Very good Thai food here.  Most dishes are above average with a few standouts.  Penang curry with shrimp was amazing.  Perfectly creamy with just the rice amount of spice.  The appetizer sampler which came with crab rangoon, egg and spring rolls, and fried shumai was good too with the crab rangoon being the best of the bunch.   As for the negatives, the fried rice was okay.  Both the curry and regular versions needed more flavor.  Be warned, the Tom Yom soup served in the traditional pot is enough to feed a family.  I found theirs a little too sour and not as good as the ones I've had at other Thai restaurants.  Iced coffee was good, but consisted mostly of ice cubes and little coffee. Good ambiance, friendly service.  For some reason, the food never tastes as good when carrying out so I recommend dining in.",0.9836,0.783,0.207,0.01,0.4950801282051282

I'm only judging Opart by one takeout of phad thai which is not a good enough standard to judge by so this judgement is more about the transaction. Otherwise, Thai is my favorite and I try a variety of dishes in Thai places around Chicago, NYC and Seattle (and stayed in Thailand for 3 months up and down the country).  When I ordered the takeout of veggie phad thai, the guy said $9.54. I paid that without really thinking. Then while waiting for the food, I looked at the menu and it said phad thai was $6.54. When the food came, the receipt said it was $8.54. So maybe I paid $8.54 and he just mistakenly said $9.54. I had already put the jumble of change in my wallet and didn't look back at how much he gave back to me. I asked why it cost $8.54. He said ""it's $2.00 for extra veggies, we do that for chicken or tofu too"", justifying it. I didn't order extra veggies, I just said veggie phad thai, but I didn't argue about it. When I ate the phad thai, I did not have extra veggies, it was just a standard amount. And the phad thai was okay. I was a little miffed. The menu should really say ""phad thai, $8.54"" NOT $6.54 if they're gonna tack on an extra $2.00 for what should be standard with the dish.  But this place was packed with people.

2012-01-10,5.0,"My 100th review on yelp!!! Came here on a Monday night and the place was pretty crowded. We made reservations and our table was ready to go when we all arrived. Inside the place, the atmosphere is trendy and modern. I believe that the decor is even flown in from Thailand! It's a cute little spot for a date night. The food on the menu is also comparable to other Thai restaurants in the area.  Our waitress, Anitra, was awesome. Having to wait on tables in the whole Restaurant seems like it would be a handful, but she did it flawlessly. Also, like I've mentioned before in reviews, it's my biggest pet peeve to not have my water glass filled when it's empty. We had a small pitcher of water to share at the table and once that was empty, it was refilled. I actually don't mind having a pitcher at the table, only because I would prefer to refill my own water than sit at the table with an empty glass and thirsty.  Things I would recommend from the menu: 1. Satay- Chicken is marinated perfectly with grilled to perfection. (Not dry and tough, but very moist) 2. Crab Rangoon- This is probably one of my most favorite dishes. A lot of other places that I've been to tend to skimp out on the cream cheese... but not at Opart. There is just the right amount of cream cheese and the won ton wrapper is fried to give the right amount of crispiness.  3. Moo Ping- This dish is not offered at a lot of Thai places. If you want to try something different, definitely order this.. and don't forget to order a side of sticky rice.  4. If you're into beef dishes, try the Tiger Cry and ask for it spicy. The beef is tender and juicy with lots of spices.  5. Poh Tak (Seafood)- Similar to the Tom Yum, but it has a lot of seafood in it. It is served in a traditional Thai pot (the ones you would get if you ordered this dish in Thailand) 6. If you like squid, try the tum pla muk- Squid salad. You can also ask them to make it to your liking. For example, if you want it to be more salty and spicy, just say so! 7. I love seafood, so I would for the entree, if you're craving noodles, try the Lard Nar Seafood. Just the the Lard Nar offered at other places, but this one is a seafood combo! I could go on and on about things to order at this place, but my review would never end. To summarize, you can't go wrong with anything that you order on the menu.

I typically start new Thai experiences with their Panang Curry - my theory being that, much like Pad Thai, if you can't get the Panang right, I'm not going to bother eating anything else there.  Their Panang was fair, though between my dining companion (who ordered the Red Curry) and I, we noticed that their spice level is pretty much relegated to ""Very"" and ""Not"". Ultimately, the best part about the evening was the wine, which I brought, and the conversation.  Sadly, Opart was responsible for neither. All in all, not the worst experience I've ever had in Chicago Thai, but by no means the best.  Definitely noticed, shall we say, insect life wandering around the picture frame on the wall.  Not very appetizing.  Really might want to look into that... Next time I'm craving Thai food on a Monday, I'll wait the extra evening, and head back to Aroy.",0.987,0.783,0.186,0.031,0.4516274836274836

We split the peanut lover's chicken for our entree, which while incredibly tasty, did not have quite as much sauce on it as I would have liked.  I'm a big sauce person.  So much so that I often order food based on the sauce, with the protein either secondary or a total after thought.  I would have preferred some extra sauce to sop up with my rice.  But overall, a really good dish.   If this weren't so far away from my current west loop abode, I'd frequent here a lot more often.  I wish there was an Opart in my 'hood...le sigh.",0.9934,0.81,0.161,0.029,0.4965925925925927

2011-06-14,3.0,"My two cents.  Great for a date or say that last minute meal you need to help soak up all the drinking you've done after hitting up Mai fest or Oktoberfest in Lincoln Square.  Thursday nights are opportune for bumping into a table full of attractive ladies, FYI.  Check out Opart's photos and you should love their atmosphere and décor.  There aren't many Asian restaurants (in or around the city) with as much décor from the motherland, so when you do come across it, it's memorable.  The atmosphere feels warm and furniture is comfortable for the longer dinners with ample conversation.   I want to love this place because of their expansive menu and numerous options of soups and appetizers.  If there is an appetizer menu at a restaurant, I typically want to order many; I like having many small plates of things to try.  So, the fact that they offer their appetizer plate with servings for four for $8.99 is sweet!   However there are a few details to this place that are lacking.    Service and their attitude are lacking.  No helpfulness is seen and I've never yet had an amazing experience with a waiter or waitress.  Asian menus tend to only list what's in an entrée, but neglects to depict to its reader the taste associated.   When I try varieties of Ethnic food, I like to try different items and try to stay away from ordering the same old shit.  Everyone orders pad Thai, basil chicken, panang curries, lard nar, etc.  It's when you branch out you discover other entrees or appy's that are taste worthy.  For this feat; help is needed and that is missing.  Try asking for a recommendation and get either no result because they are uncertain of your tastes or if you're lucky they might recommend one of the typical dishes I've listed above.  Ask about a curry or what's the difference between yellow, red, green, or brown sauce and, well, I'm still trying to process the answers I've received.   If management is reading, a picture menu would be awesome.  If you see a bunch of tables with a fancy looking metal bowl with soup within, don't order it!  We followed other tables and got some kind of Thai hot and sour soup with chicken and it was terrible.  Too much lemon grass and lime juice and to top it off it contained a crotch full of cilantro.  I like cilantro, but that was horrid.   Again if waiters spent less time trying to impress us with their sashaying down the runway and more time listening and paying attention.  I think the overall could be hella better.  Solid three and a half stars in my book.",0.9877,0.799,0.145,0.057,0.4758744855967079

2011-06-09,4.0,"I used to go to Spoon Thai down the street for all my Thai needs. However, Spoon seems to be slacking these days (you can check out my re-review for them if you want), so we have recently started branching out to other local Thai places. Since Opart is just a few doors down, it seemed pretty logical to give them a try. The atmosphere of Opart is definitely superior to Spoon, in my opinion. Opart is much larger and thus can hold a lot more people. However, even when it's full, you can still actually hold a conversation in Opart - it isn't overly loud. The seating at Opart is also more comfortable. The service is great at Opart as well. On the times that we've been there, the servers have always been on the top of their game. I haven't had a single instance of being without water (which is useful for their spicy dishes), and they have been quick to take our orders, remove our plates, and bring us the bill. The food also comes out at the same time for the entire group. Although that seems like a strange thing to be complimenting them on, Spoon has been having some big problems with that, which is actually one of the main reasons we started branching out in the first place. So how about the food itself? I'm not going to go and say that it is really much better at Opart. To me, it seemed pretty much equal. But as you can see from my profile pic, I'm a white guy. I'll be the first to admit that my usual ""go-to"" Thai dishes include fried rice, Pad Thai, and the vegetable dishes. So don't take my review seriously if you are the kind of person who orders REAL Thai food, like all that stuff on the menu that I can't pronounce. So all in all, if the food is just as good (and the same price), and the atmosphere and service are better at Opart, I see no reason to stop going there.

2011-04-17,2.0,"I'm torn about Opart Thai House. I've lived nearby for almost a year, and the other day I decided to try it for the first time. We called for delivery and were very surprised to learn that they would not deliver to our house! We live only 1.3 miles from the restaurant, and apparently we are two houses away from the edge of their delivery zone. (As a comparison, we also live two houses out of delivery zone of Sticky Rice, which is more than 2 miles away, and they still deliver to us!!) Additionally, the server speaking to me on the phone was very rude when I tried to confirm the order. But okay, fine, we'll go pick up the food. We left the house right away, and the food was ready as soon as we arrived. Very quick! We went straight home, got plates out, and immediately noticed that the food was all cold. Considering we live so close to the restaurant (and we were driving, not walking), that seems really fast for the food to be cold. Everything had to be re-heated. That being said, I really liked what we had. The pad thai was pretty good, although not my favorite. But it was a big helping with plenty of chicken. The pad kratiam prik thai (beef in a white pepper garlic sauce) was absolutely delicious! And the fried wonton appetizer was also very good.

I ordered Pad See Ewe to go and dug into it when I got home. I liked that the to-go container kept it relatively hot during continued shopping in the area and the trip home. However, I didn't like the lack of Chinese broccoli in the dish, and concerning the broccoli, the lack of broccoli leaves. It was basically all stalks, which I thought was a very cheap move. It also took away so much from the overall flavor. To add injury to insult, the broccoli wasn't cooked long enough either, leaving it rather crunchy.  The sauce was good, but lots of the noodles were charred. I got pork for the meat, and that was on the dry side despite the sauce. My conclusion was; it wasn't good, but it wasn't bad either. I imagine the dish to have an angel on one shoulder and a demon on the other, both trying to sway it each other's way causing the dish to call 'neutral.' So, I give this place three stars because if in dire need of Pad See Ewe, the proximity to my living quarters would cause me to go ahead and get it from here with appropriate expectations.

Sometimes said friends and I agree ( M Henry) and sometimes I just have to question their tastebuds (Orange Garden). Opart has been in this same spot for years. It actually reminds me of the old days when I didn't have a life and I would get takeout from here and go next door and rent a movie from BP Video on a Saturday night. Thankfully times have changed. Opart has expanded their space quite a bit and the decor is downright upscale compared to its former self. I was pleasantly surprised at the surroundings. The menu is still as expansive as it was, with plenty of options for the neophyte Thai eater, or someone with a more advanced palate. We started with Tiger Cry, which is a marinated beef appetizer. The last time I had it, the meat was gross so I never ordered it again. It turns out that Opart change their meat supplier so my friends ordered it and I was curious if it had improved. It blew me away. It was so tender and flavorful; I couldn't believe this was the same dish from years ago. To that we also ordered a cucumber salad and crab rangoon, both of which were good, and on par with any better-than-average Thai restaurant. For entrees we chose pad prik (I firmly believe my friend ordered this just so she could say ""prik"" loudly) with beef, curry fried rice with pork, and pad si ew with chicken. Of the three, the pad prik was the best. We ordered it medium spicy and I was downing water like no other. Good stuff. The others were fine; I've had better, but I've certainly had worse.

The papaya salad was supposedly made with fresh papaya but the only thing papaya in it was the sauce which they made really spicy and I have a high tolerance for spicy. the pad prik king was good in my opinion but there was nothing Thai about it. We also ordered this other seafood dish and it was very bland.  Shrimp with vegetables is what I would call it.  I would consider it more like a chop suey than Thai food.  Perhaps, we just ordered the wrong dishes but I would consider it mediocre and more like a 2 star but I gave them an extra star because the curries next to us smelled decent.",0.9357,0.831,0.141,0.027,0.5853703703703704

That's not to say that the quality of the food diminished, it is still excellent. I guess I just liked going better while it was relatively undiscovered. Anyways, as a seasoned Opart goer lol, I recommend the Tom Yam Kung, which is like a sour and spicy soup and their green curry. mmmmm. also, their thai iced coffee is so delish Also, I have to be an asshole and say that it bothers me when people eat with chopsticks.

Like Rosded, you get take the Brown line to Western if you're an El'er, though the parking lot across the stress is only $1/hr for us drivers. Place is decently big, probably sits near 100 if really busy, and split into three sections, with the first bound to be the coldest during the winter since it's the one with the door. Draft dodgers should sit in the middle or south section. Nice enough otherwise inside--all dark wood sorta cool. The menu is as extensive as Rosded--though every item more expensive. I tried the Crab Rangoon ($4.50, $4.99 deliv)) which were good, but the sauce was underimpressive--nearly tasteless and so thin so as to not stick to the wonton at all. Wife had the Fried Tofu ($3.99) which were also okay (I sampled one), though again the accompanying sauce was marginal. I was really underimpressed by the Kuay Tiew Kee Mao (drunken noodles, $6.50, $6.99 deliv), which had very little spiciness (even though I ordered medium [in Thai] and wife ensured I got it right), was minimal in terms of taste and bulk. It was small, the beef so-so, and very little of the accompanying veggies--to top it off, it was warm at best, not close to hot. Wife got Pad Ped Pla Dook ($8.59) which is stirfried catfish which she said was only OK (not a fish guy, I dare not try), but it looked pretty--was also warmer than mine, though not spicy either.  Think this is a BYOB place, though I coulda sworn a saw a minimal bar?!?!?! Also have delivery, though keen observers will note the delivery menu--or the take out if they hand you the paper copy--has prices $0.50 or more than you'd pay eating in--don't know what that's about really, but our bill would have been about $2.50 more on the four things we ordered, not to mention a $2.50 fee on top (I'm okay with that). My guess is bill will run 15-20% more than Rosded for no added value, though still not real expensive compared to some other joints. Probably do 3.5 stars if available, but that's about it.

However, as anyone who has worked in the restaurant business knows (and I happen to be one of those people), if your customers have a bad experience, they won't be back and they will tell other people to not visit the establishment.  All restaurants/cooks have their bad nights when things are not going quite as well as expected, but there is little excuse for food that is not fresh and dishes that are not clean. Gray bean sprouts are unacceptable. I've had my share of Pad Thai and can say that it's not a difficult dish to prepare. My noodles were clumpy either because they were sitting for a long time, were overcooked or (and I really hope this wasn't the case) microwaved.

Hot, or medium are perfectly hot enough!  Also, if you don't get the fried banana dessert, you've blown it. It's a cold, mushy banana surrounded by a warm fried filo dough, all smothered in honey.

2009-03-13,4.0,"In the Big Ole Windy City, there is surprisingly a LOT of Thai food places... but authentic Thai?  That's the hard one to come by. In terms of pure spice, Opart accomplished this on the only visit that I've had thus far. Decor was nice!  Darkwood, greeted with smiles and led to a table immediately... not ridiculously busy for a Thursday night at 6:30 PM, but the quietness was enjoyable as we settled in for our meal.  Felt very upscale restaurant. Fiancee and I started with a Crab Rangoon - Crisp, melty, perfectly golden, but suffering from the same malaise that other crab rangoons suffer from: lack of crab.  8 servings for $5 was definitely a good deal though. We had two dishes - Lard Nar (seafood version) and Red Curry with Catfish (I forget the Thai name) Via my fiancee, the Lard Nar deserved four stars.  I tasted the nicely cooked shrimp that was done to an excellent tenderness, and the plentiful squid which was tender as well.  Tender squid is a tough thing to accomplish (at least in my kitchen) and I'm always impressed by such a feat. When ordering my Red Curry Catfish dish, the waitress asked me if I wanted mild, medium or hot.  Curious as to how hot it could be, I asked her, and she let me know that it would be Thai hot.  Now in all my time in Chicago, one friend has brought me to an authetic Thai place and I've never had such hot food in my life.  I miss it.  So I ordered Thai Hot. This curry was phenomenal.  Milky texture, soft catfish, and SPICY curry.  While it wasn't as hot as my past experience with my friend, this was closer than any other Thai place I've been to and I really enjoyed it. Grand dining total after tax and tip?  $28.  Not bad, especially with leftovers from my fiancee to make another meal for her.

They were huge, though and you could tell they were made in house.  We split the Tom Yum Kai (tom yum with chicken) next and loved it. It was a little more citrusy than I'm used to, but the spice was great. They also serve all their soups in tureens with burners underneath so your soup stays really hot. It was a nice, fun touch. We also split the green curry (delicious!) and the pad see ewe with chicken (good, but nothing compares to Butterfly down on Grand Ave.). I noticed the portions are smaller than most Thai places, but we still had leftovers to bring home.

The food is your standard Thai fare: appetizers, noodle and rice dishes, and dishes based around meat, meat, and more meat. The food is prepared very quickly and it is fresh and tasty... yum.  A couple of negatives (even if it is a 5-star review): Their meat dishes don't have a lot of vegetables in them. ""Why is this a complaint?"" you ask. Because sometimes I want a combination of veggies and not just two chunks of broccoli and beef. I know, call me crazy. Second, their waiters can have attitudes. Why the attitude my friend? I'm only trying to eat some of your delicious food.  Prices are great, parking is very easy, and the ambiance is pretty decent if you go into one of the back rooms. The front room has a lot of foot traffic.

To start I have nothing to complain about in regards to service or decor.  Yes, the waitstaff is standoffish and semi-cold, but living in Seattle has forever changed my views on what to expect in this category.  I didn't mind if they looked put off as long as they got me my food in a timely fashion. So on to the eats.  We started with the Fried Tofu Satay and the Spring Rolls.  The fried tofu came out in ""sticks"" and tasted chewy, not crispy.  The accompanying peanut sauce tasted like the stuff I can buy from the grocery store.  The spring rolls were straight up foul.  They came drenched in this gelatenous sweet and sour sauce.  It was unedible. Next we did the Papaya Salad and Tom Yum with chicken.  The Papaya Salad was decent, as was the Tom Yum.  The soup was a bit watered down and not nearly as flavorfull as others I've had in the past.   After seeing that every table ordered the Crab Rangoon we decided to follow suit, even though this is not a Thai dish.  It was good for what it was...wonton wrapper fried with cream cheese and some kind of Krab.   The entrees were totally hit and miss.  I shared the full fried Red Snapper in a red curry with my mom.  It was the highlight of the night.  Yes, a whole fried fish is kind of novelty, but the fried bits covered in curry was quite nice.  I ordered the Green Curry with Chicken and Fried Tofu and just kind of looked at another watered down version of what I love so much.  My sister got the Chicken Satay...it looked like chicken on a stick and my step dad got some shrimp dish which also looked meh.

I had such high hopes when I walked into the place but left feeling a bit let down. First off, although the staff was cordial, I got the feeling I was literally being ""rushed"" out of the place. This could be attributed to the fact that I arrived about half an hour before closing; however, if they took me in as a customer and were going to take my money, they should treat me like any other customer.  I ordered the recommended Tiger Cry beef for appetitizer and was disappointed. Although the menu said the beef was char-grilled, what I got was mostly burned, inedible pieces of beef that were bitter to the taste, spare a few pieces towards the middle of the pile. Next, came the potstickers. Two out of the five pieces were so hard that I couldn't even bite into it. I had to use my chopsticks to literally pry it open just so I can get to the pork inside and toss the dumpling skin aside. The only thing I was totally impressed was was their yum woon sen (noodle and chicken salad). It's one of the best I've had and is probably their saving grace. The only complaint I have about this dish is the fact that they used mainly ground chicken instead of actual chicken strips, which most other Thai restaurants use in their yum woon sen. Their Kee Mao noodles was just alright. I've had better but there really wasn't anything too special about it. The plate was a bit small and was filled more with veggies than chicken or noodles. Also the fact that I got ALL 4 dishes at once practically made me feel as if they wanted me to leave asap, because by the time I got to my main dish (the Kee Mao noodles), it was starting to get cold already (it was the 2nd dish to arrive out of all the plates). Overall, I was unimpressed by the restaurant. I don't know if I'll be dining there anytime again soon. Hopefully I'll just chart this down to being there as their last customer.
