When we walked in all the tables were taken but i was told to put my name and number and a table should be ready shortly. We were also given a menu to look at while we waited. So i know people have said that this place is small.. IT IS SMALL definitely not good for a group of people! After waiting for about 10 minutes, we were seated. Since the place is small, the service is quick. We ordered pannenkoekens, one apple caramel and one sausage mushroom and cheese with scrambled egg on top (which is extra) We both got coffee as well! The food came out quickly and it was DELICIOUS! The pancakes are thin, almost crepe like... Usually when we go out for breakfast, i always go savory because the sweet breakfast items are too sweet or just not satisfying. So Ryan and i always say ""lets get one sweet and one savory and share!"" It never works cause we both would hog the savory... I would say that our sweet pancake was the perfect amount of sweetness! We actually shared! The menu is small, different sweet and savory pancakes. They also have a handful of french toast options and then your normal breakfast fare, eggs, sausage and hashbrowns. I would definitely recommend trying this place out if you're curious! It is a bit pricier than i thought but i'm glad we finally tried it! CASH ONLY!!!",0.9962,0.758,0.221,0.021,0.5933333333333335

From the cramped feel and lack of space, to the high prices, I felt right at home in Amsterdam again. I say that in jest but it's tiny in there.  They don't give a lot of food but it is great quality. Some of the best hash browns I've had and my wife's pancake was amazing. But the eggs were nothing special I couldn't make at home in ten minutes.  If you're looking for something to blow you away if you not come here. But it's enjoyable.

2017-01-23,5.0,"Pannenkoen Cafe is a GREAT little breakfast spot in the heart of Lincoln Square.  Now, when I say ""little"", I really mean it. The entire cafe seats about 20 customers. We went on a Monday morning about 11:00 am and had no trouble getting a table for 3, but I can imagine at peak breakfast hours and on weekends, there is a bit of a wait. When we left around noon the entire place was full! As for the food, if you go here, you must try the Dutch pancakes! They're priced at about $11 a piece which is a decent price as they're HUGE. However, they're extremely thin so I'd say portions are just just right. We tried the apple ginger (not a big fan of the ginger jam) and the apple/cheese/raisin which was fantastic! The apples on each were extremely thinly sliced, similar in thickness to the pancake, which made the dishes easy to eat. I also tried the hash browns per recommendation of the other yelpers on here. They were nice and crispy which I love, but if that's not what you're looking for I'd look elsewhere.  (I'd also like to note that the hashbrowns are fresh! The waiter informed the table next to us that they boil and peel the potatoes, shred them, and then fry!) The best part of the experience for me was how friendly the staff was.

2016-08-12,4.0,"Came here with my brother for brunch after seeing multiple pictures on the inter-webs. Service was great, we were seated immediately and served immediately. We both got omelettes and split a half order of Nutella French toast.  The omelette- it was nice, not anything special or different from other brunch places I've tried. This dish comes with a side of hash browns and your choice of toast. The hash browns had been shredded so thin that a lot of it was sort of burnt. The toast was great because of the choices in spread that they had, being an authentic Dutch restaurant it was all freshly imported. My favorite was def the apricot.  The Nutella French toast- honestly, some of the best French toast I've had yet (and that's saying a lot because I've ate my fair share of French toast!) the only bone I had to pick with this is the fact that half an order of French toast is about $7 and a full order is $8. I had ordered the half because I thought the full order would be a bit much- in reality it was one piece of toast cut in half so I'm wondering what this ""full"" order consists of especially since there's only a $1 difference which really seems silly.  Another thing I didn't realize was how small this place was. Unfortunately, we got seated right by the coffee machines so the waitresses were constantly there and quite bulky around us- kind of takes away that relaxation I like when it comes to having brunch.

2016-07-04,4.0,"Hubby and I were looking for a place for breakfast/brunch on the July 4th.  Since ""Pannenkoeken Cafe"" was open on Easter Sunday this year, it was safe to assume that it would be open on a national holiday.   Wait is to be expected since it's an extremely tiny place, featuring seven (7) tables and most of them are suitable for parties no larger than four (4).  Put your name, cell#, and the number of your party on the wait list.  When a table is ready for you, the server will give you a call.  Thus my suggestion is not to travel too far so that you won't end up losing your queue.   After thirty (30) minutes worth of the wait and killing time by strolling through Lincoln Square, there was a table ready for us.  Even though the space was quite cramped, the service was attentive.  I wanted something sweet rather than savory, so I went with the blueberry mascarpone French toasts.  The blueberry sauce with mascarpone whipped cream was nice and concentrated.  Overall, I was very happy with my choice of entree this late morning.   All of the pancake entrees appeared enormous in portion, but the pancake itself was thin and almost resembled a French crepe.  If you're someone who likes the unique fragrance and taste ginger renders, give the ginger apple pancake a try because it's right in the middle of ""sweet"" and ""savory"" in my opinion.   It's a cash-only establishment.  Brunch for two (2) costs around $30, including two (2) small, fresh-squeezed OJ.  Paid street parking on Western can be found easily enough.  Otherwise, utilize CTA #81 (Lawrence), #49 (Western), or the Brown Line train (Western stop).",0.9523,0.885,0.1,0.015,0.49147465437788024

The savory ones aren't my favorite since the mushrooms/sausage/cheese, etc are all tossed on top rather than cooked in the batter, but it's all a matter of preference I suppose!  The two waitresses are the sweetest people in the world, and they have a little peep window looking into the kitchen so that you could see all of the food being made while you're waiting.

It is one of those local haunts that may not have a huge reputation, but it's a gem. It's tiny (maybe 6-7 tables) so if you're able to go during an off-peak time, that's highly recommended. The Dutch pancakes are like crepes--thin and large. The apple and the apple ginger pannenkoeken are my favorites. I've never tried the savory ones but I'm told they are just as delicious. They have the best, fresh-squeezed orange juice I've ever had. It's sweet and tart. They also served more conventional pancakes, french toast and eggs.

2016-04-03,1.0,"This is my first review I've ever written on Yelp after 6 years of eating around Chicago. I decided to go to pannenkoeken because a friend told me the food was good. The cafe is really, really small, seating 6 tables. Going at 9:45 on a Sunday morning, I expected any breakfast spot to have a long wait so was not surprised to wait 50 min for my group of 2 to be called. However, there is one table for two that is right next to the entrance, where people waiting to be seated are pretty much on top of you. You can smell the breath of people waiting, hear every whisper.  I saw a table for four open up at the same time so asked a waitress if we could be seated there instead. She said no, there was a party of 3 coming in. Makes sense, no problem. Then another table of 2 opens up, where the previous customers had just paid and got up to leave. I asked our waitress again to be seated there instead. In the most rude, condescending tone possible, she says we can't play musical chairs and have to sit at this table. All they had to do was wipe off the other table, which was not 1 step away from all other people waiting to be seated.  So I left and ate elsewhere. I will never go back to this cafe. I debated eating and not tipping, but didn't think I wanted to spend any money at all there. Screw this place, learn to have a better attitude being a waitress.",0.5221,0.899,0.051,0.05,0.41866883116883113

2016-03-20,5.0,"A cute little Dutch eatery that exudes charm from the moment you step through the doorway.  My fiancée was looking for a nice place to get a waffle, as we've not had the best luck in our area (one would think that a neighborhood like Lakeview would have at least a few places to get great waffles, but we've not as of yet found that to be the case).  She was perfectly pleased with her yummy looking waffle, while I found myself gleefully eying the mouth watering chocolate banana Dutch pancake that had been placed in front of me.  My favorite thing was that it was just the right amount of sweet, and none of the ingredients were doled out in excessive amount (which is often the case with sweet pancakes).  My only regret (aside from the pancake being ever so slightly on the dry side, which didn't taint the deliciousness) was that my stomach didn't have enough room to try some of the challah-based French toast, which also looked to die for.  I'll definitely be coming back here next time I find myself in Ravenswood/Lincoln Square area!",0.9833,0.756,0.193,0.051,0.554875283446712

I walk by every day on my way to work and every time I fantasize about blowing off work for the morning to have a real breakfast. The menu here balances sweet and savory, and the highlights are the challah French toasts and the Pannenkoeken, which I can best describe as wide and flat breakfast pizza crusts that can come with sweet or savory toppings. They do have some traditional breakfast items but if you're going to brunch at a Dutch pancake house, you don't just order eggs. Blueberry mascarpone French toast is awesome and so is Pannenkoeken with Havarti and spicy salami (I added a fried egg...worth it). It's not the best brunch in Chicago but it's unique and one of Lincoln Square's better options.

2013-09-21,1.0,"This review has nothing to do with the food, which was unique and pretty great, truth be told. The 1 star review that I am giving here is due to the terrible service that my girlfriend and I received this morning. From the moment we were seated my girlfriend and I got the general vibe that the server did not want us to be there. After being ignored for about 10 minutes, which itself is hard to explain considering that the place only has like 6 or 7 tables, we finally ordered. We both ordered the dish for which the cafe is named. From the moment we ordered it took 1 hour and 20 minutes to receive our food. During this time period there was the occasional coffee refill but no explanation at all as to the tardiness of the order. We watched every other table that was seated around the same time as us or even a little after eat and leave before we even got our order. Finally the food came with a very weak, ""sorry about the lateness if your order,"" to compensate for the lengthy wait. Famished, we finally ate and the food was very good. When it was over my girlfriend asked the server,""How long does an order like this usually take to cook?"" To which he responded, 10-15 minutes."" She then asked, ""Well then do you know why our order took so long?"" To which he somewhat snottily replied, ""I have no idea, I was out getting groceries, maybe they messed up the order."" Absolutely zero effort was made to explain the service lapse and nothing was done to make it right. It's the first time in my 33 years that I have stiffed a server on a tip.

A rainy Thursday morning seems to be a good time to avoid the crowds. The menu seems to have grown quite a bit since I was last here, lo these many years ago. But we decided to stick with the namesake specialties. The Broccoli Goddess chose the vegetarian pancake; this gives you a choice of three different vegetables. She chose to stick with broccoli. Not exactly a surprise, and truthfully, I think she chose this place because she knew she could get her favorite food here. I went with the savory bacon and Havarti pancake. I chose to sprinkle the Dutch molasses syrup on top, and it was really good. I enjoyed the house coffee too.  Both of us were very happy with food, service, and atmosphere.

My son had a egg cheese sandwich. On the menu it came with meat and three eggs. I asked for it to have no meat and only two eggs. Why they still charged me full price for it I don't know. They don't have a kids menu so I think that they should at least price down something if we're not getting the full order. They lost a star on that. The waiter was pretty cool. My friend and I did drool over the two ladies who ordered the ""pancakes."" We'll def be going back to try those. They look like they are big enough to split with someone.

Most German food that I've liked were served at my German friends' homes. At dining establishments, there was always something missing -- like flavour and authenticity. Then a friend recommended Pannenkoeken for breakfast. French toast with blueberry compote. Apple ginger pannenkoeken. Chocolate banana pannenkoeken. What took me so long to have discovered this small cafe? Let me just start by saying that at the risk of sounding excessively cliche, the French toast was to die for. Mostly because the blueberry compote was not a concoction of blueberries in a syrup. It all tasted fresh. The apple ginger pannenkoeken transported me to Frankfurt. I kid you not when the server asked me how was it and I responded with ""Leker."" I speak several language and German is not one of them, so imagine my surprise when that word slipped out. On my second visit, I chocolate banana pannenkoeken. By the time I was done with this particular pannenkoeken, it was evident that this will be my Saturday morning breakfast spot. I had found a German spot worthy of blogging and worthy of frequenting. Be warned that Pannenkoeken has a cash-only policy and the dining area is small.

I spent some time in Amsterdam over Christmas and my absolute favorite meal was without a doubt pannenkoeken.  Much like Chicago, every pancake joint in Holland has their own version of pannenkoeken and I was pleased to find that the pancakes served at Pannenkoeken Cafe are very similar to what you get at Pancake Bakery in Amsterdam, flavor-wise.  The main difference is that Pancake Bakery disperses the ingredients and cheese throughout the pancake and then bakes it off, where Pannenkoeken Cafe lays strips of bacon and cheese kind of in the middle of the pancake.  I think I prefer the EuroVersion a bit better. But still.. it's really good. I highly recommend getting a savory pancake.  And don't be scared of that Dutch syrup.  It's the shizzle.  Not too sweet and kind of thick like molasses.  Very different from American pancake syrup.

I ordered the sausage, mushroom and havarti koeken, and side of sausage. The waiter asked me if I wanted a side of sausage to go with my two orders of sausage. Cheeky kunt.  The koeken itself surprisingly has a very nice flavor to it. It's slightly crunchy on the outside, while being fluffy on the inside. It's perfectly fine all by itself, covered with the dark Netherland-born syrup they bring out to the table. With the toppings it was pure heaven. Someone else ordered the bacon and cheese, which was even better than mine. The only problem was that it mysteriously kept eating itself when my roommate wasn't looking. The only problems are the food takes a while to come to you, if there are people taking their time eating, the wait will be long.

There is always a waiter, chef, or someone standing near you because the place is so small. The tables is the back are nice and comfortable. The food is really good and this place offers it's unique foor offering - the Pannenkoeken. A Pannenkoeken is a really big (10"" maybe) pancake the extends past the edges of the plate that are topped with sweet or savory options. My wife got the chocolate banana topped one and it was quite tasty. For me, it would have been much to much of the same taste, and the chocolate dominated the plate. The table next to us got a savory once and it smelled heavenly. I would consider ordering one if if I found my way back. Without tasting it, it's hard to imagine it tasting anything better than a quesadilla, but I'd be willing to try. I ordered the Apple french toast which was good, but a little soggy for my preferences. The apples were freshly peeled and sautéed. It's nice to see quality products on a plate. I was half expecting canned apple pie filling to top my french toast to be honest. The whipped cream is all house made and pretty good. Pricing it pretty fair for the amount of food you get. There is plenty of street parking in front of the restaurant and a lot less than a block away. It's also right near the Western stop. If I didn't live in the area, I probably would not come back.

2012-07-04,3.0,"I have mixed feelings about this cafe.  I grew up in the Netherlands, so I came here with a healthy dose of nostalgic expectations, even though experience has taught me that this was always a big mistake.   We arrived here on a rainy afternoon.  It was not raining when we arrived, and I put down my cell number and we loitered on the street waiting to be called (no place to stand or sit inside).  When the rain came we first huddled in an empty doorway, but when it turned into a torrential downpour I ran into the plastic/canvas enclosed (but leaky) doorway of the restaurant for some steamy shelter.  At last we were called and were seated. The restaurant is very pleasant inside - prettily decorated, and although small, it did not feel cramped.  Our waiter was very friendly, prompt, attentive and efficient.  My companion and I each ordered one of the traditional Dutch pancakes.  And when they arrived...first I should say that they tasted excellent.  I ordered the ham and cheese without pineapple, and the ham was amazing.  My companion ordered the apple/cinnamon and the apples were fresh and crisp.  However, they were far from authentic.  Pannenkoeken are indeed thin, but not so thin as to be slightly dry, or crisp and near-burnt on the edges, as these were.  They are moist throughout.  In addition, whatever toppings are included are always finely sliced and cooked within the pancake itself, not sliced into chunks, like the apples and ham here, and placed onto the pancake after it was cooked. So while the taste was delightful and I knew better than to listen to my nostalgic yearnings, I was still surprised that they were so far off the mark.  But, given the quality of the food, I would bet that the rest of the menu here is a success.",0.9939,0.838,0.149,0.013,0.6426523297491039
2012-07-01,5.0,"Got a Groupon for this little café ($10 for $20) and decided to do brunch there with my friend. Upon entering, you realize just how small this place is; it's not quite what I'd call quaint, but waiting a few minutes by the door was not an issue.  The menu is basically divided into sweet and savory pannenkoeken and then a list of standard breakfast fare. At first many things didn't sound very appetizing (bacon and melted cheese in a thin pancake, ewww!), but my friend and I settled on a Belgian waffle and the aforementioned bacon pannenkoeken in addition to a side of scrambled eggs and hash browns. They squeeze their own orange juice here, which is a nice touch. The wait was a bit longer than I'd anticipate for such a small breakfast joint, but I was worth every second.  I'd never had nor seen a pannenkoeken before, so it was an entirely new experience. Very large, very flat, and 4 pieces of cheese-covered bacon. It looked interesting in a bad way, so I stuck with my Belgian waffle, which was heaven. I've been to 4 and 5-star places for breakfast that charge $50+ per person, and their Belgian waffles have either strawberries or blueberries and a smidge of whipped cream. Not here. My fluffy waffle was covered in bananas, then a heap of whipped cream, finally garnished with a plethora of fresh strawberries and blueberries. I was pleasantly surprised. Continuing to impress me, Pannenkoeken Café's hash browns are the best I've had: crunchy, but not burnt, and plentiful. I couldn't get enough of them! I finally mustered up the courage to try the bacon pannenkoeken, and I ate about 70% of it myself. It was delicious. I'd never known of such a wonderful combination of wheat, cheese, and meat. I'd highly, highly recommend it.  I rate this place 5 stars because the food quality beyond impressed me, and is better than what I've had in places that charge many times the price. On the downside, it is small, which could lead to long wait times, and service wasn't great. We were seated for a good 40 minutes and our food came out, but we still had no silverware.",0.996,0.777,0.181,0.042,0.5411047077922078

2012-05-16,4.0,"So I was a bit wary about coming here knowing how small it is - but I live 2 seconds away and was told they take your phone number and call you when a table's available, so you're free to roam the area. Or in our case, go back home and sleep for a little while longer. But, surprisingly (maybe not? at least to us) at 10am on a Saturday morning, there was no wait at all for 2 people.  The downside of this is that I wasn't hungry enough yet, as I was expecting an hour or so wait, but that's what leftovers are for. Having never been there I decided to go against ordering the food the cafe is named for - and opted for the Nutella Chocolate Chip Challah French Toast with Strawberries. IT WAS AMAZING. The french toast was thick and hearty, and they spread the nutella liberally.  Chocolate chips in the bread, too, if the nutella isn't a chocolate fix enough for you. The strawberries were an additional cost but definitely worth it - you need something to offset the sweetness of the nutella, powdered sugar, and the syrup you'll pour on it - so why not fruit?  We also ordered the bacon and havarti pannenkoeken. With butter and syrup spread over it, it was excellent.  We ate it like a pancake, but next time - I saw a girl next to me fold hers up into quarters and ate it like a stack of pancakes - this is especially genius if you order one that has all the fixins' spread across the top.

2012-04-08,5.0,"Much has been written about the savory and sweet pannenkoeken offerings, of the indulgent french toast creations and of their fluffy omelets. What sets this joint apart? The aroma of the place. Sausage hits the grill and it sends just a whiff on by you. Somebody order fresh O.Juice? Sweet and tangy slaps you in the face. You peer at the counter and watch a contraption filling a pitcher with a single helping of juice delight. That's fresh. Finally, a place that offers a true mug of coffee. This is important, for a proper mug sets the stage. It is voluminous but not so much as to have you worry it will grow cold while you sip. Large enough to keep both my hands warm. Smells faintly like breakfast in here but this is no greasy spoon. Menu prices are fair and not surprising.   I've indulged in both their savory and sweet pannenkoeken, buttermilk pancakes, spinach and feta omelet, and the french toast. The standout for me is the french toast particularly their off menu special, apple cinnamon. Fresh apple baked right in and served with a dollop of fresh whip cream and ever so thinly sliced apples atop with a marmalade. Crisp on the exterior, soft and sweet on the inside. Not mushy nor dry. Real Maple syrup at the offering.   Yes, it's tiny; not much room to stand indoors. I have witnessed young families of four or five dining along side me, this is no bother though it may be for others. They take care in managing a waiting list with call-backs and freeing tables. It is within walking distance for me but there is pay-lot parking 100ft south on Lincoln.  As a local resident of the Lincoln Square neighborhood what I adore most about this tasty gem of a cafe is they consistently serve fresh piping hot breakfast/brunch fare in what I see as a quaint, cozy space.

Apparently the new menus with the ""new prices"" haven't arrived from the printers yet.  Note to Pannenkoeken Cafe: maybe you should think about honoring the ""old prices"" until your new menus arrive, then your customers might not feel so ripped off and you'd make yourself look slightly less shady. I had a Groupon which had to be presented before ordering. There were other diners seated nearby that were also using a Groupon and I overheard them  question the higher prices as well. Did make me wonder if the jacked up special prices were just to offset any loss incurred by their Groupon deal. Portions were small. Coffee tasted like it may have been sitting on the warmer since early last week. Omelette was really good, but small...hash browns were cold,  pannenkoeken tasted like it may have been made from recycled cardboard. No amount of syrup or whipped cream could save it.

I saw at least four parties walk in, look into the restaurant and the crowd of eight people standing in the doorway, and promptly walk out.  Your method of a sign in sheet+telephone number is a good attempt at catching all of your foot traffic, but obviously isn't effective in the winter.  Maybe it works in the summer when people can walk around Lincoln Square while they wait for a phone call an hour later. So here you have limited seating space which creates a long lead time to be seated very soon after opening in the morning.  Then you only charge approximately $8 for your main attractor, the pannenkoeken.  Finally you close at 2pm.  It seems as though the space needs to be expanded, the price raised, or the hours increased.  Otherwise you are not being as profitable as possible.  Just my 2 cents.",0.9227,0.889,0.078,0.033,0.5276643990929706

Now....I realize it was the last weekend to use the Groupon which my GF told me last minute she still had to use..so our bad on going on the last weekend.  But again, this place ALWAYS has a long line...and thus they should not have been on Groupon to begin with.  Beyond that issue, they really need to bite the bullet, ove to a bigger space, and pay a higher rent given their great product, so they're not keeping people stading outside in 20 degree weather (which we won't be again!)  It was interesting that while we were waiting, we saw at least 4 people show up, see the line, and sell their Groupons to people waiting in line. That kind of defeats the prupose of a Groupon to begin with in temrs of attracting new  customers.as  it simply subsidized current customers in line.",0.8248,0.859,0.081,0.06,0.4125192400192402
2011-12-12,4.0,"So I went to go eat at this place once again in such a long time about 1 week and a half ago! And its just some good amazing brunch and for the first time I ordered a salami and cheese pannenkoeken. It was very good so I would recommend the salami and cheese to all of those new comers. It was recommended to me so I'm recommending it to all of y'all . I also had a the chocolate banana pannenkoeken and it fits more like a desert, very sweet, crunchy with the nuts and the whip creme taste's very home made(delicious)  The cappuccinos are absolutely good. I could've gotten more foam but that's just my taste on how I like my cappuccino. Orange juice is always my favorite, freshly squeezed no seeds what so ever because I know some places you still see the seeds inside the juice. My boyfriend had a spinach and feta omelet that was to die for. He never had tasted a spinach and feta omelet. He loved it along with the fruit and toast very healthy very good, so I recommend that also.  Its a very small place compared to the old one on Oakley. We had to wait just a little bit but it was worth it.  I Guarantee you new comers! They do have a little kids menu that I personally think little kids would love it. I've seen how they look and its adorable, a teddy bear pancake with strawberries and whip creme.  (SERVICE) ....BUT MY SERVER was just a little off her game as usual I'm guessing and I recognized her from the old Panennkoeken Cafe by Oakley before it was that offal Yucca Cafe. A short hair tall young lady she use to work along with a short young lady probably a teenager, with glasses that did a waaay much better job than her, Every time I would sit with my boyfriend at a table she already knew what I wanted that's the type of service I absolutely love in any restaurant that I go to regularly. It just seemed like the tall young lady would slack off at the other location as much as she probably does on this location. Any who I stayed waiting a little too long for my both panennkoeken because she had mixed my order with another table, she said she was so sorry, that she would give us a discount for waiting for a long time. The other table was also bothered that she had the order wrong for them. So basically she didn't put in the other tables order.  Other than that I personally think the food is amazing always gets me smiling when I get my food in front of me. Compliments to the chef's that do an amazing job. The atmosphere is always welcoming simple but very nice. Good music as well. They pulled off a great restaurant in a small place so props for that one.

Unfortunately that did not happen. Here's what did. On Sunday morning my significant other and I walked around Lincoln Square in hopes of finding a nice little place for breakfast. We came upon Pannenkoeken Café and were told there would be a 10-15 minute wait and to put our name the list. No problem, it's 15 minutes, so we do. Well, fast forward 15 minutes later and a group of 3 come by and ask what the wait time is. We tell them 10-15 minutes and so they go in to add there name to the list. A minute or two later I look in the window to see that same group of 3 sitting down being waited on. Shocked at first I go in to check the list and make sure we weren't crossed off, we weren't. Then I think, ""well they did sit at a table of 4 and since we were just 2 it is understandable"", but it wasn't. We had already been waiting 15 minutes now going on 20. I would have understood if we had both gotten there around the same time, but we had already been waiting. Disturbed by this, we waited another couple minutes thinking another table must be opening up and that is why they did this. Nope, after about 25 minutes of waiting, we decided to leave. It's a shame because they could have had 5 customers business that morning, but because of their poor customer service they only had 3.",-0.8491,0.876,0.049,0.075,0.5345833333333333

I think the secret has to lie in the Swedish names or maybe it's just me. :-) This place is in my old neighborhood from when I was a 5 year-old so every so often, I'd scope out the 'hood and see what's new. I'd passed by this place once before trying to walk around an insanely long brunch line and made a mental note to come back and try it.  I met up with a friend right around opening time to sort of ensure we'd get a seat and because I had gotten into town at 6 a.m. that morning. Somehow I get there on time and I'm the one flying in from SFO?!  All joking aside though, breakfast was well worth me not gnoshing on a bagel for my commute from the airport. I ordered the Greek omelet with mushrooms and a mighty tasty cup of coffee that I never saw the bottom of. My friend had one egg, bacon and cinnamon toast. That's something you don't see every day-cinnamon toast.  My omelet came with so much feta cheese, my teeth were squeaking halfway through the course. It wasn't over or undercooked and the hash browns were just crispy enough and not swimming in grease like the way I've had at other places. Our service there was extraordinary and with the quality of brunch items in conjunction with the coziness of the space, I could see how this place gets a crowd for brunch.

2011-07-15,3.0,"I can't quite decide whether or not I like Pannenkoeken Cafe.  When we came here, they had the strangest way of placing people EVER - you put your number down, and they'd call you when your table is ready. I had never been to a place with this system before, so I was kinda surprised. But looking at the inside, I understood why they have to do it that way.  So we put our name and number down, and decided to take a short walk around the neighborhood since there was no place to stand inside. We ended up going to the sport store couple doors down, and then walked through that store to the back door and went to a market there. I kept checking my phone hoping that they'd call, but nothing.  About an hour later, I was getting restless - so we decided to walk back to the restaurant. Surprisingly our name was crossed out. I asked the host/waiter, and he said he did try calling me, but I didn't answer. I checked my phone again - full services, no missed call??? However, he was sincerely apologetic and he sat us within the next 10 minutes.  The food was very good. I got the Chocolate Banana Pannekoeken and my boyfriend went with the Veggie one (he chose spinach, tomatoes and pepper - perfection). To me it tasted a lot like a big crepe (which exactly is what it is), but I can live of crepes, so I had no issues with it. We ended up trading our dishes later, because I enjoyed the veggie one much better, there was too much chocolate on mine.  I would come back here, and hopefully next time my phone works, or the mixed up won't happen. I was pleased with the server/host though - he was, seriously, the most genuine waiter I've ever met. He kept apologizing throughout and thanked us for understanding, and we weren't even making a big deal out of it.  I gave this place a 3 stars because of their tiny seating area - the whole time we felt like we have to finish everything quickly and get out of there so someone else can sit down. Not a place to meet up with a friend and catch up. I wouldn't recommend bringing kids here either - too small.",0.924,0.83,0.098,0.072,0.3603594771241831
2011-07-13,3.0,"Found this place after yelping around for pancakes in response to my girlfriend's increasingly serious hints/demands for some.  No one is kidding when they say this place is small.  The plates they serve you are fairly large as well.  This is very noticeable to you, and the people less than a quarter foot away from you, when you're sitting on a table for two.  It does help to see what other types of pannenkoeken the kitchen can crank out.  So look left and right at others' plates - they're already looking at yours.  I would also watch your conversation, as eavesdropping is all but unavoidable. I had the bacon pannenkoeken.  Executed, it's their batter spread thicker than a crepe's thickness, but much thinner than an American pancake.  It was topped with 4 glorious slices of bacon, each topped with a slice of melted Harvati cheese.  These flavors together were complimentary, somewhat subdued, and overall pleasant.  I remain interested in tasting what the addition of mushrooms would've brought to this, but either the waitress or kitchen felt I didn't require it despite my indication for such.  I would eat it again, but not go out of the way for it. These pannenkoekens didn't bring a strong presence of flavor, which is what my girlfriend had hoped for with her apple pannenkoeken.  You would think that that many apple slices would have a bright tartness, but it was surprisingly bland.  She doctored that up with some of the Swedish fruit preserves they had at the table, and it was considerably better afterwards.  There were golden raisins in there too, but their impact overall to the overall flavor was slight. I suggest you call ahead for expectations on wait times before heading out.  Also they're cash only.  Once you're in there though, the service is pretty good.  There is the factor that it's difficult to not get their attention given that they're basically around you or the table next to you.  But our server this visit was on top of things and attentive.",0.9901,0.845,0.129,0.026,0.46685867895545313
2011-06-24,4.0,"I have mixed feelings about Pannenkoeken Cafe.  First off, I will say that I am happy to have this place in the area, and the food is great. However, I will also say that I don't go there often, nor do I plan on going again any time soon. The food is quite good. I have never actually had the specialty Dutch Pannenkoeken thing, so I guess that should be minus one star for me. I usually stick to the french toast, with a side of hash browns. The french toast is excellent, and you can get whipped cream & strawberries added, to make it even better. The hash browns are also excellent. Coffee is good. Service is pretty quick, and friendly as well. But the main problem I have is simply the size of the place. There are I think six or seven tables, and some of those are two-person tables. That means that there is always a wait, unless you go right when they open. This isn't necessarily the end of the world I suppose, especially since they let you leave your cell phone so they can call you when your table is ready. I guess that's a good feature. But the small size of the place also means that you'll end up feeling a little cramped, and you may also feel rushed since there are inevitably going to be a bunch of people waiting for a table. And if you end up being inside when one of the Lincoln Square stroller moms has one (or more) of their demon-children inside, you're going to be very annoyed, very fast. (Last time I was in there a family was literally letting their infant brat put their feet all over the table. Yes, bare feet, on top of their table, while we were eating. NASTY.) One other thing of advice. The restaurant is cash only, although there is a small ATM located inside.  So to summarize: excellent food, too small of a place. If you go, go early, or be prepared to wait. And as a warning, you may or may not end up feeling stabby before you leave.",0.9908,0.833,0.139,0.028,0.5519802555168408

2011-05-05,4.0,"Oh my God, droooool. I go to this place whenever my nostalgia for Amsterdam becomes too overwhelming to handle. I'm a bit surprised at how underrepresented Dutch cuisine is in the US - I see it as a perfect blend between the richer, more complex flavours of more southern European cuisine (such as French) and the more simplistic style of the northerners. In any case, I think Dutch food is great... all sandwiches and unpretentious pastries and delicious coffee... When I first tried pannenkoeken in the Netherlands, it was such a revelation. I swear, I could feel the light shining on me from the heavens above. If you've never had pannenkoeken before, well, prepared to be enlightened. It's pretty much what it would be if an American pancake and a French crepe had a baby together. Think about that for a moment. Feel the saliva building up in your mouth. Mmm yes.  Pannenkoeken is much lighter than the American pancake and it has toppings on it like a crepe does, but instead of being folded up, it's spread out on a plate for you to admire. Like a crepe, you can get it sweet or savoury. There's some super dessert-y options on the menu (I think there was a nutella + banana + whipped cream creation?) and some lighter, more traditional fare. My favourite was definitely the one with apples, Havarti, and raisins. For the savoury options, you can get different types of meat on it with various cheeses, or you can get a veggie option, which is damn good as well.  Anyway, this place is indeed small, as was mentioned, and will usually require a bit of a wait. The larger your party, the longer the wait... I personally wouldn't try to bring more than 4 people in, unless some are kids and in that case, everyone can just squeeze into a booth. No reservations, but you can put your name on a waiting list when you arrive and then go back out and wander around until they're ready for you. This place is definitely worth it!

The crusts of the toast were completely black and the inside was a soggy mess.  It was really gross.  Needless to say, my kids did not eat it.

The hazelnuts really enhanced the dish by adding texture and a nice nutty flavor.  The belgian waffles were extraordinary. One of the best recipes I've tasted, which is saying a lot.

I thought she should have comped his meal since waited so long for it or even just offered him up a drink of his choice rather than just bring a random cup of juice to him with the bill.  Anyways, the food was pretty good.  It is definitely unique brunch food, and both the sweet and savory dishes were tasty.  However, the service was really lacking and the food takes way too long to come out, so we will not be back.  Bummer!",0.968,0.86,0.098,0.042,0.5790404040404039

But I finally did discover Pannenkoken Cafe, even if it was far later than it should have been.  First time I ordered the chocolate banana pannenkoken.  Even though it was good, I was stealing far too much of my boyfriend's bacon & cheese pannenkoken.  The second time there I ordered my own bacon & cheese pannenkoken, and the boyfriend ordered the ham, pineapple, and cheese pannenkoken.  He swore it was even better than the bacon and cheese, but I was too happy with my own to bother trying his out.   You will probably wait before sitting on weekends as the place is minuscule, but it is worth it!

2010-11-15,4.0,"This place is always packed and I admit we don't go here more often because the thought of having to wait outside for 20+ minutes on the weekend (at best) is a bit daunting. However, it is definitely worth the wait & is why people keep coming back. First off, this place is tiny. I'm talking about 7 small tables max and you are right up against other tables so if seek an intimate and private breakfast/brunch place, look elsewhere.  I secretly like the coziness of it though; it makes me feel like I'm at some bed & breakfast in the Netherlands :).  Since it's so small, they do not have an indoor waiting area; however, they do have a sign-in sheet and will call you when a table is ready.  Fortunately this place is right around the corner from Lincoln Ave. so you can do a little walking through the heart of Lincoln Square while you wait to make the time pass more quickly.  Also, because of the usual long waiting list and limited seating, this is also not a place where you can linger for hours upon end. We've been here a couple of times and I shamefully have not tried the signature pannenkoeken! I know, I should be banned. However, I have tried both the buttermilk pancakes and the French toast which have both been amazing. The food is always fresh and made to order. You can order a variety of sides (eggs, sausage, bacon, fruit, etc.) and they have a large variety of delicious beverages too. Do yourself a favor and try the hot chocolate - so good! Topped with whipped cream & chocolate drizzle, it doesn't get any better. Oh, and make sure to bring some cash as they do not accept credit cards.  Also, I recently noticed a sign banning strollers inside (because they seriously will not fit) so if you plan on trekking here with your little ones, leave the stroller at home.  Make sure you plan your trip in advance here because they close very early.

Hard to blame a place for being small - they do what they do well in such a small space.  If you are needing a private conversation, not the place to go...you're a foot away from other diners. Service was very good once we got seated.  We went on a weekend when the weather was good, which worked well, as we had to wait outside for 25 minutes or so.  So negative points for no indoor waiting space.  But they take #'s and will call you, so you can wander nearby Lincoln Square if the wait is longer than a few.

The pancake was tasty and crispy, and the toppings were perfect complements.    Loved that the apples were not saturated in butter and sugar but rather thinly sliced with a sprinkling of walnuts.  The omelets are just the right size and can be accompanied by fresh fruit instead of heavy potatoes.  Service is friendly and the coffee is outstanding.  This is a refreshing alternative to the large, expensive, over the top offerings at many breakfast places.  Must try the sister restaurant on North Ave. soon.",0.9799,0.835,0.157,0.007,0.6473602484472051

Let's just say if you get more than 10 people in there if feels cramped. The table are small & rather close to each other, but the food more than makes up for feeling ""close"" to other patrons. It definitely has a European charm to it, that makes me love it even more.  Okay let's talk the food, I really enjoyed my veggie pannenkoeken. I got the spinach, broccoli & tomato one and it comes covered with mozzarella cheese...it was delicious & light. I like that the pancake is not at all sweet especially as it would clash with the veggie flavors. Also, they serve a mean cup of coffee and happily refill the entire time you are there...nice!  So, why the 4 stars rather than 5...well, it comes down to the sweet pancake my friend & I split (so as to not seem too gluttonous).

Yes it's a very small place (it may have been a shoe repair place once.) It reminded me of the tight squeeze of dining on the old Empire Builder train to Seattle; of how much more space there was in that dining car than in Pannenkoeken. Naturally, only one waitress and one bus person required. Both were great, especially the waitress, who was friendly and helpful. While waiting, we joked that this was yet another café we've gone to that has a canvas covered entry ""air lock"" built out onto the sidewalk. Adding space without removing any from the actual interior. After squeezing into our seats, we both ordered a savory pancake each: the bacon, mushroom + Havarti cheese, and the sausage, mushroom + Havarti. These pancakes are very thin but large -- 12-inches in diameter. Kind of a super thin Dutch pizza! The best way I found to eat something this big is to lift one side with your utensils and fold it in half, trapping the fillings. I've seen others fold them into quarters, but then too much of the stuffings will squeeze out. Bites of each were shared. The bacon was crisp but not overly dry. The sausage is described as ""crumbled"" in their menu, but these were spicy links that were sliced. Both were delicious and required no sauce or syrup, although something looking like maple syrup was offered. For dessert, we split an apple, cinnamon, and toasted hazel nut pannenkoeken, topped with whipped cream, which was just marvelous. This would make a great breakfast pancake! Not much of a hint of cinnamon though and the sliced nuts looked like almond. But we didn't leave a bit on our plates. So next time, call ahead and gauge the wait time.

2009-12-18,5.0,"Being Dutch, I thought I would get back to my roots (and explore a previously uncharted area of my neighborhood) by heading over to Lincoln Square for some brunch and boy was I blown away.   This tiny little gem of a restaurant, tucked away on Western and barely visible from the street is just fantabulous.  It is literally so great that I had to make up a word to describe it!   Anyway, they are obviously famous for their Dutch pancakes which resemble a kind of happy medium between a pancake and a crepe.  It's nice and crispy on the edges, getting softer towards the center.  Now the real trick to Dutch pancakes is how you eat them.  I opted for the flip-in-half technique, making it look like a quesadilla but I saw others eat it open-face, skinny roll-up/burrito style, and one person who picked off the toppings then ate the pancake with their fingers (and no, this person was not under the age of 6).  The quesadilla technique was perfection for my apple/ginger Pannenkoek and my older gentlemen friend agreed that it was just right for his sausage/mushroom/havarti combo. Mine was delish, left nothing to be desired and went perfectly with the side of sausages and fresh squeezed OJ I had (yes, I most definitely said fresh squeezed.  more on that later.)  I had a taste of the sausage/havarti/mushroom, sans mushrooms of course since they are poisonous, and that was yummy too (adore havarti cheese)!  Apparently pannenkoeken is perfection with sweet, savory, and I'm guessing any other flavoring of food you may want on it.    As promised, here's my rave for their fresh squeezed orange juice... YOU MUST DRINK IT!  I watched our waitress shove whole oranges into the juicer (skin and all) to make my glass of OJ and when she brought it over, it had seeds in it!  crunch crunch, I love texture.  The best part about this is that a glass of OJ was only about $3.  Last time I had the pleasure of indulging in fresh squeezed OJ I paid $6.75 for it!  aaaand, it did NOT have seeds in it.  Travesty, I know. Moral of the story is this:  Pannenkoeken Cafe is perfection.  And I will not be taking any stars away because it's tiny because they offer call ahead seating, reservations, and a nifty little clipboard contraption where they'll call you when your table is ready.  I will caveat my review, and echo Janie C's comments, that this is not a dine and dash kind of place - only come with someone you like to chat with because you'll wait a bit for the food!",0.9977,0.776,0.191,0.033,0.4891636141636141

Since it was a Thursday, the boyfriend decided to ditch class (as snow tends to have that fuck-this-I'm-not-doing-anything effect on us) and we arrived at our destination around noon-thirty. We were promptly seated by the waitress (who, as other reviewers have mentioned, is ridiculously sweet & adorable) and offered drinks, at which point my journey into a blissful food coma began, for I had the BEST. CHAI. LATTE. EVER. I would highly, highly reccomend that everyone order one, as it is one of the tastiest drinks to have ever graced my lips. I almost ordered another when I was finished! But alas, I had to save room for the actual meal. Naturally he and I both went for the Pannenkoekens, him choosing a bacon/egg/Havarti one and me going for a spinach/green pepper/mushroom/Havarti combo. It is REALLY difficult to pick between sweet or savory here, but we told ourselves we'd come back for the former. As we waited for our orders to be completed, the boyfriend got his coffee refilled meticulously. Only two more patrons were in the restaurant at the time, so the atmosphere was very quiet and relaxing, just how I like it. They do play music, which is at a perfectly low volume that allows for conversation. It's good stuff, too; major bonus points for playing one of my favorite songs ever (Nouvelle Vague's ""Dance with Me"" cover) as well as some old school No Doubt! When our meal finally came, we initially had ""oh shit"" reactions as the crepe-like pancakes were bigger than the plate! Two bites into our meals, we decided it was more logical to fold it in half. And god, THE TASTE! The veggies in mine were fresh, plentiful and sauteed to perfection, with the Havarti being a rich and creamy glue that held them together. My boyfriend poured maple syrup on his, thus cheating the system and getting to enjoy both sweet and savory flavors. He loved it, and I dug the bite I had as well even though I'm not usually a fan of bacon. These monsters were super filling, but we both had to finish ours to the last bite, they were just too good. So glad we didn't order any sides. So, obviously, I had an amazing time here. Also, their generous coffee refills stopped me from spending multiple paychecks' worth of money at the surrounding boutiques, as the boyfriend had a dire need to pee when I was already at $250.

Well the place is tiny, even by Chicago breakfast standards.  There are only seven tables.  They also have one bathroom.  So this place is small!  We are told there will be a 40 minute wait.  So we decide to wander around the Lincoln Square area.  Pannenkoeken will call us on our cell phone when a table opens.  Well 45 minutes go by and no call.  So we head back over to Pannenkoeken.  We wait another 20 minutes or so (65 minutes in total) before we get a table.  Boy I really hope the food is good in this place! I order the quality Bacon and Cheese Pannenkoeken (a Dutch pancake) with an extra of quality Sausage.  There is also a quality Sausage and Cheese Pannenkoeken, which I could add quality Bacon to but it costs more.  The cheese is Havarti, some of the creamest and smoothest cheese I have ever had.  I also saw a Chocolate Banana Pannenkoeken that includes hazelnuts and whipped cream that sounds totally good but probably way too fattening. My wife and daughter both order the Sausage, Mushroom and Cheese (again Havarti) Pannenkoeken.  My son orders a Belgian Waffle.  He also ordered a side of bacon, he usually does.  Well everyone loved their orders.  I of course sampled everyones and would have to agree they were all quite tasty.  The thin Dutch pancakes were very good.  The price for all four of us, including drinks was around $44 dollars. The only negatives from our experience besides the incredible wait was Pannenkoeken only takes cash (and the ATM was broken), we think they forgot the side of bacon my son ordered as we had to remind them and even then it took a while to get to us.  The plates did take some time to get to us after we ordered (again there are only seven tables) and I would agree with my son that his chocolate milk did taste real funky.

So, I ordered the chocolate and strawberry crepe while she ""built her own"" crepe with vegetables and havarti cheese. We both split an order of hash browns to accompany our crepes.  WOW. The crepes were absolutely delicious (and huge!). I tried her crepe and it was wonderful. I was soooo happy with my chocolate crepe, and we both really enjoyed the hash browns.

2008-05-28,4.0,"Apparently one of the owners made frequent trips to The Netherlands (stoner) and befriended some people who had their own pancake restaurants. After some convincing she bought several recipes at $500 a piece, studied the preparation techniques and came back to Chicago to start her own Pannenkoeken Haus. I have now been here two weeks in a row. The first time I lucked out and got a table right away but couldn't really figure out why as there are only about 5 tables in the entire place. The second time I had to wait a while but it was worth it. It's restaurants like this that make me proud to live in Chicago. There are very few places in this country where you can get a Dutch style pancake with bacon and havarti cheese on top. I know, it sounds both weird and heavenly at the same time but it's a treat to be experienced.  I don't really see myself ordering anything other than the same thing over and over because if it's not broke, don't fix it. I did get a side of sausage links the last time and they were both good and hearty. If small places and close quarters freak you out, this isn't the place for you.

2008-04-15,4.0,"Having lived in Lincoln Square for 10 years and being very, very lazy, I was happy to see a breakfast place open a block from my home. Everytime I passed by it there was a line out the door. Well, needless to say I didn't hurry in. (I already told you I'M LAZY, I don't want to stand outside in the cold while waiting for others to finish their food so I can be seated.) Recently, Spunkypants and I decided to go for it. Standing BE DAMNED!  We went, we stood, it wasn't so bad. The seating is so cramped we both sat on the booth side (I still apologize for that Spunkypants, I know it was weird, but I hate having strangers rub up against me to hit the loo, you know?). The next table became overun with rugrats towing their parents to breakfast and I became tense. Luckily, the lovely people of Pannenkoeken came over to our table and filled my mug with the most delicious coffee I have ever had in Lincoln Square. You could have fed me toasted tar-doodles and I still wouldn't have cared because the coffee was felicitous.  I had the bannana/chocolate, my dining partner had the bacon/cheese (right?). First of all, these things are huge. Prepare yourself however you need to before you arrive. ahem. Line your purse with tinfoil, whatever. I really enjoyed the yummy Dutch pancake and delicious coffee. I'd like to go back. Does anyone know a time when there is no one in there and I won't feel immiment pressure from sad people waiting in line, staring at me while I eat?

I also am creepily attracted to small things, and well---in this case places. I had luck on a Monday lunch break of getting a table with my lover-man in the front window.  Once seated, though small, my butt was out of the way so I felt comfortable and uncramped (however if you are claustrophobic I would not suggest eating in). The waitress was highly attentive and we placed our order for: 1 Bacon and Havarti cheese Dutch pannenkoekken 1 2-egg overmedium (with toast and hashbrowns) and fat ass sausage 1 order plain buttermilk pancakes Our food did not arrive quickly or too late. It gave us a good amount of time to speak to eachother, give dirty looks to some loud-talkers, and examine the things on the table. We especially liked examining the many little spreads (which we later experimented with on our toast and pancakes) When the food arrived, I was taken back by the awesome smell. I had read that some people said their food was immemorable or bland, but I assure you that all the flavors were there and everything tasted wonderful. The sausage and thick-bacon were fresh, both the pancakes were tasty, and I will be definitely coming back.  I left like the fat American I am; happy, deathly full, and still reminiscing about the 10lbs of food I shoveled down my throat. Between the two of us, with tea and coffee it came to $23 even.

2008-03-08,4.0,"I like breakfast. I like it early. Therefore, the coffee must be strong and excellent. Pannenkoeken, a fairly new addition to the Lincoln Square/Ravenswood neighborhood, fit the bill on both of these counts.  A friend and I met here for breakfast on one of the coldest days of this winter. I arrived a little early, and after fighting the biting wind the ten or so feet from my car to the door, they let me in even though they weren't officially open for business. That may sound like a small thing to some, but when you're frozen just from walking a few steps, it means a lot. My friend drove the half mile from her house because it was just too frigid to walk. In direct contrast to the cold was the warmth of the service we received in the restaurant. We were taken care of right away with hot coffee. Although any hot liquid would've felt good at this point, their coffee was really very delicious. I'd never had a Dutch pancake before, but it seemed right to order something with Danish cheese in it (at least it's from the same part of the world), so I ordered the bacon and havarti pannenkoeken, light on the cheese. My friend ordered the banana chocolate one. She was kind of overwhelmed by the amount of whipped cream, but was happy overall. I was pretty pleased with my choice, though I took half of it home and ate it for lunch the next day. It's just a lot of food! Before we left, the place had filled up entirely, with one group waiting. It's a tiny place, as noted by other reviewers, so that's no surprise.

Maybe it's a nit with the dish, not the preparation - but I really wasn't impressed at all.  They did everything fine - good service, etc, but there's only so much you can do with a Swedish pancake. We were some of the first people there on Saturday and were seated promptly, although by the end of our meal, the place was completely full.

We had the most intimate table in the restaurant and even so when I had to get up to go to the ladies room I was in the lap of the people at the next table. It was unbelievable how tight it was. If there was any longer of a wait for a table I would have left. The waiter seemed to completely disregard the fact that it was a small place but otherwise the service was very good.  I'm glad I did give it a chance. I had the highly recommended chocolate and banana pannenkoeken and one of the best latte's I've had in years. It was a very good meal. I expected that it would be more like a crepe. I was very pleasantly surprise. The contrast of the almost crisp pancake with the whipped cream and the banana was perfectly balanced with the chocolate so it made a great meal and not just a dessert.  On the other hand my mother's meal wasn't nearly as good and her black coffee was very bitter. She was very uncomfortable in the tight table which just made the experience more unpleasant. I highly recommend that you go on an off hour with just one other person. I drove past recently and see that they are now open later on weekends. The meal was very good and they always seem to have some very good savory specials.,0.996,0.71,0.238,0.053,0.5468641114982579

Prices were a tad higher than I would expect on things like omelets and the egg dishes since there's lots of competition out there, but I can see the premium on the pannenkoeken since its not something you can get everywhere.

The food here is very good; maybe a bit pricey for what you get, but only a bit.  And considering the neighborhood, it'd be something of a shock if it was otherwise.  I'm sure the rents are outrageous.  They have a small, breakfasty menu which features an assortment of the pannenkoeken from which they've taken their name.  I had the apple-cinnamon in spite of the fact that I  rather feared getting something akin to the Walker Brothers' apple-pancake-bigger-than-your-head.  But it turned out to be a single large crepe-like pancake with slices of apple, a generous sprinkle of cinnamon and some whipped cream.  (The real thing, not the oil+air+sugar thing that comes out of cans.)  It was delicious, only as sweet as the apples and cream, and wonderfully light.  I had a side of bacon -- cooked exactly the way I asked for it -- and about twelve cups of their excellent coffee.  It was more than enough for lunch.  My only real quibble, and it's a small one, is that they only have three pannenkoeken pans in the kitchen so I had to wait for mine because all four of us ordered pannenkoeken.  I didn't have to wait long; it wasn't that big a deal. The staff is excellent.  They're attentive without being overbearing, and they navigate the space with grace, very obviously aware of what is going on around them.  Both when we entered and left, I saw the wait staff watching to make sure that we could get through without a problem.  Again, given the size of the place, this kind of attention to detail is a big plus.

2007-09-10,4.0,"It's the first week of business for this place, and already they're slammed, proving two things:  one, that Lincoln Square really needed a new breakfast place, and two, new businesses on the square can flourish. Pannenkoeken cafe takes over the formerly-divey spot next door to Garcia's.  When I lived in Lincoln Square in 1998, it was a hamburger joint.  Then it became a string of Mexican joints that just couldn't drum up a business (um...I wonder why, considering that they're only NEXT DOOR to one of the most popular Mexican restaurants in Chicago...)  I'm so thrilled that there's finally something new, different, and chic in that location, and I'm sure that it's here to stay. Okay.  On to the food.  Pannenkoeken is the Dutch word for pancakes.  There are a few varieties of Dutch pancake available here, including chocolate banana, apple, and bacon cheese.  There was also a listing for a ginger-raisin pannenkoek  on the menu that was taped up in the window, but it was not available on the menu that was handed to us at our table.  I hope that whatever happens, they decide to go ahead with that menu item, because it sounds interesting. I got the chocolate banana pannenkoek, and it was yummy, slathered with whipped cream, chocolate sauce, and powdered sugar, and some chopped toasted nuts (I thought they were peanuts, but the reviewer before me says they were hazelnuts, so I'll have to defer...)  It was somewhat thinner than the pancakes I ate in Amsterdam, but still heavier than a crepe, like a Dutch pancake should be. My husband ordered the veggie omlette, which came with a side of potatoes and toast.  The eggs were very fluffy, but the veggie mixture was kind of heavy on the peppers.  The omlette didn't come with cheese on it, and I think it would have benefited from that addition.  I'll try it that way the next time we order it.  (Yes, we will be back).  The multigrain toast that he ordered wtih his omlette was, I think, from Val's bakery.  Good stuff.  The potatoes were boring (grated, possibly previously frozen), but okay. My mom ordered a belgian waffle with fresh berries, and my mom's boyfriend ordered eggs and toast.  I didn't taste their breakfasts, but they said they were good (My mom's boyfriend's over-easy eggs looked perfectly cooked).  My baby son got a bowl of oatmeal with cream, brown sugar, and raisins.  Unfortunately, he can't talk to give his opinion, but he ate the whole bowl full, as well as the bananas from my mom's waffle.  The staff were very gracious to let us order a half order of the oatmeal at a children's menu price, even though oatmeal isn't on the children's menu.  They also have fruit-topped American-style baking powder pancakes, for the less adventurous palates (unfortunately, the pancakes don't have fruit stirred into the batter). Coffee is from Coffee & Tea exchange and is exceptionally good.  Our waitress was very friendly and capable, even though she confessed it was her first day on the job.  The decor is pretty, with lots of bright pastel colors, and the music piped in is nice (I remember hearing Michael Penn and Beth Nielsen Chapman, both favorites of mine) The one real complaint I have with this place, and this probably has to do with their being newly opened, is that they have a long wait and have no idea how to judge exactly how long that wait is.  They told us it would be about 20 minutes for us, and it ended up being 45 minutes.  By the time we sat down, we were hungry and grouchy and the baby was fussing.  They do allow you to call ahead and put your name on the wait list, so I advise doing that.  They will not push two 2-top tables together to make a 4-top, so if there are a lot of big parties, they will wait longer. All in all, though, I enjoyed my dining experience.  I hope that this restaurant is a harbinger of things to come for Lincoln Square.",0.9976,0.844,0.131,0.025,0.4952254689754688
2007-09-05,5.0,"Wow. We have been waiting for this place to open and it was worth it! Today was their second day of business. Pannenkoeken Cafe is just north of Garcia's entrance on Western ave. It's a two-minute walk from the Western brown line stop, there's metered parking out front, and parking lots on Leland ave. Their hours are 6 am - 3 pm Monday - Friday, and 8 am - 3 pm on weekends. The restaurant has a light, airy feel despite the small size -- good decor! Tasteful lighting, a good color scheme and comfy art on the walls. (And of course, tulips.) I'd guess the place seats about twenty. The house specialty is traditional Dutch pancakes, which are about 11"" in diameter, thicker than a crepe and thinner than a pancake. I got a bacon and cheese pannenkoeken, and my fiancee got a chocolate banana pannenkoeken (with toasted hazelnuts, whipped cream, and cocoa powder. Yum!) I also got a side order of sausages, which were huge and bought at a local deli. They also have Apple pannenkoeken and Ginger (marmalade) raisin pannenkoeken, three types of pancakes, Belgian waffles, oatmeal, and a variety of egg / omelette dishes. There is also an 'on the run' portion of their menu, and you can phone an order ahead to pick it up. It includes a breakfast sandwich, mini pastries, croissants, etc. They are currently running 20% off specials on different items each day (Wednesdays were French Toast.) They're still dealing with the typical ""we just opened"" type of stuff -- they're still waiting for their credit card machine, though they had carbons in the meantime -- and they were just coming back from the store with more supplies (guess it was a good first day!), but nothing huge. The food was up promptly, tasted delicious, and was served with a smile. We'll be back -- I just hope we won't have to wait in a long line once everybody finds out about this place!",0.9772,0.905,0.09,0.005,0.41858974358974366
