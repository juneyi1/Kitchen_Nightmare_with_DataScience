2017-08-20,5.0,"I've eaten at Glenn's several times. I went for the fresh seafood, though I'm sure it's nice for breakfast / brunch too. I thought the seafood was very good. Nothing exotic, but honestly prepared, quality seafood with savory flavors. The portions are good sized, and the seafood came with some nice fingerling potatoes and some tender asparagus the night I went recently. The presentation was attractive but not pretentious.  I suggest a reservation, but often you can get a table without one. A selection of beer and wine that should suit most, as well as some good soft drinks. I went with friends and we lingered, talking and having coffee after the meal. It was very comfortable. The key is:  GOOD SEAFOOD AT MODEST PRICES.  You don't find many good seafood places on the north side here, and this could well become your go-to place for fish.

2017-06-18,5.0,"This place has ruined many a Funday Sunday for me by knocking me on my ass after eating there.  There are so many great options on the brunch menu so it is difficult for me to just get one entree and I blame Glenn's.  I am hooked on their Brown Sugar Maple Pecan pancakes, which I need if I am going to order breakfast/brunch.  But I don't consider pancakes as an entree...it is a side.  And therein lies the problem, I always get those damn pancakes and something else AND I eat it all, washing it down with champagne.  Then I need to get in bed and rub my belly until I fall asleep...buh bye Funday Sunday. The food is amazing and the portions are a little on the large size.  I have not ever had a bad meal here.  Preparation has been consistent all the time.  Not much on the menu I wouldn't eat except the cereal.  No idea why anyone would go to a restaurant to eat cereal, but they must do so.  I personally can't see paying almost $7 for cereal, but to each his own.  I know some folks freak out about paying for the cereal and the milk separate, but no one is forcing you to buy it.   Most of my orders from here are take out because I prefer to eat on my balcony and have my own drinks as the dining space is small and somewhat tight, which would knock this review down to 4 stars.  But because they take reservations, that moves them back up to 5 stars. My recommendations for breakfast/brunch would be:  Brown Sugar Maple Pecan/Fresh Blueberry pancakes, Rushing Waters Smoked Trout Hash and Eggs, Corned Beef Yukon Gold Potato Hash and Eggs, Grilled Salmon Salmon and the Steak/Eggs. For dinner: Spaghetti & Meatballs, Lobster Fettuccine Alfredo, the Three Napkin Meatloaf sandwich, Catfish Po'Boy, the Salmon spread appetizer and the grilled calamari.",-0.8784,0.904,0.027,0.069,0.5136173767752716

However it was bit insulting when all they offered us was to take the appetizer off the bill. For those that have been to Glenn's you know it's an expensive place. We were a party of four that spent over $250 so it wasn't about the money it was the insincere gesture. When this happened we swore off Glenn's. My wife was furious.  I've been asking to come back, since we really do enjoy their food my wife has been saying no. I managed to convince her to give it another try. Once again the food was great just as remembered the service sucked, again. Our food got to the table before we even got our water.

Unheard of! Our server was great. But let's get back to what we reeeally care about. The FOOD! We ordered: a cup o' chowdah, the seafood salad, and the pan seared rainbow trout with pecans & garlic butter on the side.  Their chowder is fan-friggin-tastic. Perfectly seasoned, not skimpy on clams, and not too inundated with veggies. Just perfect. I want some now just typing about it. Both entrees were *huge* (totally sufficient for splitsies if you're dining on the cheap or not a fan of leftover fish). All of the seafood was excellent and the produce was fresh.  My only complaints would be 1.) their bathroom could use some serious upgrades re: a toilet that flushes properly and 2.) their potato pancake (a signature side they serve in lieu of french fries) is not very tasty.

Bowl of cereal that didnt have enough milk. When I asked for more milk for my son it came in a little dixie cup less than 12 oz and i was charged an additional 2.95 for the milk So the bowl of cereal essentially cost me  7.95.

It's small yet intimate, but not trendy or pretentious. My wife and I started out with the ""Coconut Me Shrimpeez"" which was lightly fried with a sweet marmalade dipping sauce. I actually preferred skipping the dipping sauce (bc it was too sweet) and instead shower the coconut shrimp in Louisiana hot sauce - but that's just me. Next I ordered the Blackened Barramundi which came with sauteed potatoes and steamed broccoli. It was my first experience eating Barramundi fish and I wasn't disappointed, it was light and flaky. I highly recommend this Australian fish. My wife had the Cioppino, a light soupy and spicy broth with a nice assortment of fish. It was a very large dish, which we took home - Lunch!  Overall the service was good, mostly knowledgeable with the chalkboard menu and not too pushy if you wish to hangout and socialize well past your meal. If you are in the area and desire seafood, Glenns Diner is a must.   They are also BYOB. There is a liquor store next door that sells wine, liquor, and beer.

2016-08-20,4.0,"Cereal or seafood?  Cereal or seafood?  Seafood it is...now what type of seafood does my little heart desire?  Surely, I could eat anything on the menu, but narrowing down the options was truly the difficult task.  I'm indecisive - that's no doubt - but this was probably one of the worst cases of indecision I've faced.  Of course, there were front-runners such as the shrimp and grits or the lobster fettuccine, but all entrees sounded delicious!   Having gone to Glenn's Diner at 11:30 am on a Saturday I wasn't able to indulge in the lobster fettuccine which would have been my choice; it turns out that many of the fish dinners and specialty entrees are not served until after 3 pm.  Some of the dishes such as the shrimp and grits were served before 3 pm, but only in lunch portions...I did indeed get the shrimp and grits but this ""lunch"" portion was so goddamn big that I can't imagine what a dinner portion looks like.  I do believe that the cost was a tad bit cheaper for the lunch portion, but it was no significant difference - beware of that and the pure fact that you may not be able to order what you want when going earlier in the day. Despite this slight upset, I was perfectly satisfied with my shrimp and grits which were phenomenal.  I have nothing to compare them to since this was my first experience with shrimp and grits of any kind, but I can just guess that these are up there with some of the best.  There's a decent amount of shrimp along with plenty of ham and bacon scattered throughout the grits.  Boy was this dish good, but so incredibly filling - I couldn't even force myself to finish it.  It didn't help that the dish came with a side of eggs and Texas French Toast (my favorite!) and I'd already loaded up on the clam chowder soup beforehand...another menu item that's delicious beyond words.  My partner ordered the crabby burger and she absolutely loved it.  Soooo...everything is delicious, basically. And drum roll please: they have Three Floyds beer! Glenn's Diner has more than just amazing food and good taste in beer - they also have an eclectic taste in atmosphere as evidenced by their all-day cereal offerings.  I'm not sure how this idea to combine cereal and fish came to be, but how glad am I to see that it did. It makes for a unique experience, but what makes for a good experience is the service here at Glenn's Diner.  Our waiter was super attentive and suggestive which again helped with my indecision. Other things to address real quickly: the space inside of Glenn's Diner is not real big and therefore it would be best to go during the day (unless you want something not offered before 3) and going with a group is not advisable.  There was a group of about 10 people when I went and legitimately half the restaurant was filled up.  Also, there's some seating outside which makes obtaining a seat a little easier.  Speaking of outside space (parking spots to be exact) there's only paid parking right in front, but if you go to Ravenswood avenue you'll find PLENTY of free parking!   I plan on coming back to Glenn's Diner after work someday so that I can get my hands on this infamous lobster fettuccine!  Working so close to this restaurant I know I will be back, but it can't be too often otherwise I might be a little broke. Yes, it's not cheap here but the food is fresh and preared like no other seafood I've had.  Glenn and I are going to become real good friends, I already know.",0.9978,0.77,0.167,0.063,0.605734126984127

We had calamari for an appetizer, and I had a cup of delicious clam chowder and very tasty Columbian Sturgeon that came with asparagus and small potatoes.  I don't know what sauce was on the Sturgeon but it was incredible!  I only wished that I had some bread to dip it in!  I topped it off with a La Fin Dumonde beer for my pleasure!  My wife had one of the specials that featured salmon and asparagus, which was very good.  I would recommend getting a reservation if planning on coming here on Saturday evening as it gets pretty busy! This place does serve beer and wine but for a small corking fee you can BYOB!

2016-06-05,4.0,"Another great meal at Glenn's. A few things you should know. You can make reservations for inside, and you'll likely need them even on weekdays.   Reservations can be made up to 2 hours before the time you want.  So don't call at 530 looking for a 7.  Even if it's open they won't give it to you. Outside seating is one of the best things at Glenn's - and its first come first served. Glenn's is supposedly a diner.  They have diner food like grilled cheese and meatloaf.  But what makes them unique is their 30 plus break at cereals and huge selection of fresh seafood.   You can get your bowl refilled 2 times for free and additional milk is pretty cheap.   And the seafood is half pound portions creatively done. Hubby always gets the off menu fettuccini Alfredo with vegetables (today it as asparagus, tomatoes, mushrooms, onions) and two who pieces of garlic toast. I had the warm spinach salad.  Yum! Our son had Dad's French toast (on your choice of bread). We shared the key lime pie - which was the best we have had anywhere including key west. The staff is super edgy.  Tattoos, expensive jeans, piercings, etc. They are super friendly and knowledgable. Oh, and we ran into the mayor walking home!

The roll it was on tasted like it was baked fresh that day, the shrimp were lightly battered and the spices were on point. Lots of shrimp, they do not skimp on the fillings of their sandwiches. The sandwich was all balanced with the tartar sauce, made in house!  Last but not least, the mimosa... OJ was sweet and fresh tasting.

Yeah, we were seated in the corner right next to the front entrance, but at least we didn't have to wait too long to eat unlike other popular brunch spots. Whoever designed the layout of the restaurant's interior was probably thinking, ""Okay. How can I cram as many tables and chairs in this restaurant without violating the safety code? Hmm....."" As I got stuck with the cramped corner seat and took off my coat, I managed to knock the silverware off the table with my coat from the lack of space. Yikes. The decor is pretty random and interesting. I mean, you have a rotating headless, half mannequin sporting a T-Shirt up high on the wall for goodness' sake. There are different wall art paintings, a long chalkboard surrounding the restaurant with menu items written, a giant wall display of cereal boxes, and other miscellaneous items that don't necessarily follow a theme. It does feel like a hole-in-the-wall restaurant except on a bigger scale. We ordered the Jumbo Lump Blue Crab (x2), Corned Beef Yukon Gold Potato Hash and Eggs with a side of Blueberry Pancakes, and Ham, Shrimp, Bacon and Grits. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their dish! I had the Jumbo Lump Blue Crab, which is essentially a crab cake eggs Benedict. The crab cake actually had chunks of crab meat and was scrumptious! I do wish they added some sort of green vegetable to the dish, like spinach or something. One of us ordered the Bloody Mary, which looked incredible and like a meal in itself. It came with three big shrimp on a skewer on top of the drink, a celery stick, a carrot stick, and a slice of honey dew melon a.k.a breakfast in a cup!

For market price--$60 on this particular night--Glenns loaded me up with eight crab legs and two ears of corn rolled in parmesan cheese. Extra helpings came two crab legs at a time. But, unlike most ""all you can eat"" offering, Glenns doesn't stall between servings. Rounds of additional legs come out hot and quick. More corn and cole slaw, too, if you'd like. The crab was delicious perfection. Seriously, after unzipping some of these shells, the meat inside was bigger than a ball park hot dog. And much tastier. This is not a big place, so reservations would be a good idea if you want a table. As a walk-in, I bellied up to the counter with no problem and no rez.

Was in the mood for breakfast that day, but I would love to come back to try the seafood! Yum!",0.9908,0.686,0.265,0.05,0.619595238095238

Then we saw him only once more - when he delivered the check. Horrible. The clam chowder had an ""off"" flavor to it and the fish was overcooked. I was so disappointed by service and food.

I want to let people know about this hidden jewel I had the pleasure of traveling to this amazing establishment.  I had an awesome experience at Glen's Diner. This is by far the best seafood I have tasted in a long while, the people were warm and welcoming and the food was an added bonus.      Glenn's Diner is famous for their Blackboard menu, Colossal Crab Night on Tuesday's when you're served all you can eat Crab Legs and on Thursday's all you can eat Shrimp served with roasted potatoes, fresh vegetables/corn on the cobb, and salad.  I've gone this restaurant a few times and loved it every time I've gone.   Although these are their busiest nights, you never seem rushed.  You're able to eat your fill and drink your wine which is BYOB with no interruption. The ambience of Glenn's diner is welcoming and friendly.  From the moment you walk through the door you are treated like one of the family, the staff is wonderful.  Although small and quaint, Glenn's Diner is very full of life. Although there is a lot of hustle and bustle surrounding you, you still are treated like a special customer.  The overall feel of the place was quite refreshing. You don't feel rushed to eat or leave and It was very relaxing. The chalkboard menu special changes every day which adds to the appeal of the diner which means the choices are limitless.  I love crab legs and all you can eat Tuesday night are my favorite.  I have also tried the gumbo which was delicious, the salmon was cooked to perfection (just the right flakiness) crab cake was enough for two people to share and melts in your mouth.  There are other wonderful and delightful foods I would love to try on the menu, which I definitely intend on trying when I'm able to go back again.   My overall experience at Glenn's Diner was just memorable.  Between the great staff, food, and just overall experience Glenn's diner is becoming my most favorite restaurant. The location may be quite a distance but you won't be disappointed in the food.  I always enjoy my experience to Glenn's Diner because that's exactly what it is a wonderful experience.

We started out the night with the mussels appetizer. The mussels were clean and steamed perfectly, the broth was delicious, and the garlic toast served to absorb the remaining broth was right up my alley. On Thursday nights they have all you can eat shrimp. I found myself at a crossroad because I absolutely love shrimp and all you can eat is an amazing thing, but ultimately I wanted some variety so I chose the cioppino. Choice well made! I was slightly intimidated by the large portion size. I often commented to my husband that I felt like I was eating and eating but the bowl was still full. My husband had the corvina. He didn't think the fish itself was anything special, however, it was prepared very well and he enjoyed the diablo sauce/topping. Personally, I thought it was very yummy. Glenn's is BYOB, but we were in a rush and forgot to bring a bottle of wine. Thankfully, they have a pretty solid wine list as well as a decent beer selection. Beers come in 22 oz which is pretty awesome in my book! The overall look and feel of the restaurant is fun and pretty comfy. It is on the small side, so don't plan on private, intimate conversation with your significant other as the neighboring table is close.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating as well.

2015-02-04,5.0,"I've had brunch here years ago, I thought it was great for breakfast. A lot centered around seafood, which I'm not sure is a brunch thing for me but it was all delicious and enjoyed by the company I was with. I finally had the pleasure of making it in for the all-u-can eat Alaskan King Crab Legs on Tuesday nights. We arrived around 6pm and didn't need a reservation, they luckily had a table. Shortly after we arrived many people showed up and the restaurant was full, quickly. Our table was nice for 4, little tight but I like how small it is at Glenn's Diner, intimate. I don't think you could ever expect to go there without reservations on a Tuesday with more than 4 people. Seems like it would be hard for them to accommodate a large party. The crab legs were AMAZING! The initial serving was a large amount, probably about a pound of legs with sides and melted butter. We had to put in a lot of work to open them up, no crackers here and they don't slice them in half for you. You will need tons of napkins and they provide the sea sheller tool. Once you get a hang of it, it is well worth the work! The meat is large and juicy, fresh and warm and very sweet. As a crab leg lover, sit there all day and eat a pound, I was VERY happy with the crab legs!  When it was time to order more (how can you not eat all you can eat?) they brought one leg per person at the table that requested more. I was served 4 times after that too. Each of these legs came out fresh from the steam/boil and they were on point! These legs ordered in addition were a lot better than the initial plate of legs they brought out. I think coming out one at a time and being fresh and hot helped a lot and made the whole experience awesome! They even refreshed the melted butter so it didn't get cold and hard. Great iced tea, reminds me of a place in the south. Didn't try any of the other items on the menu for dinner but as far as the sides that come with the crab legs - loved the coleslaw (not a big fan of creamy slaws either) and it was delicious and had great flavor. The corn on the cob was also amazing, reminded me of an elote the way it was seasoned. Both sides come unlimited as well and total it cost around $50 per person at market price when we went for dinner last week.",0.999,0.758,0.227,0.015,0.5839277933395581

I had a yummy potato pancake on the side which some hot sauce complemented very well. My friend had the lobster roll. Not my favorite, but still pretty good. She also had a nice green salad that looked very tasty with a thick balsamic vinaigrette. They have a great Beer selection. I was so excited to hear that they had my favorite, Three Floyd's ""Gumballhead"" and my friend had a ""Capitol Beer"" made in Wisconsin (also very good). I really want to come here on a Tuesday for all you can eat Crab legs. :) I'd definitely come back for some brunch, good food, and company.",0.9967,0.695,0.305,0.0,0.5776126126126127

Had the oysters rockerfeller, so good.....I had to season them with salt and pepper, but that didn't matter to me. They were also so filling that I couldn't finish my entree. I got the special - which was not on the main board of specials, LOL, Red Snapper. It was topped with some cheese (white, soft, tasted like goat cheese) and tomatoes. I also liked the potatoes that came with it. I guess they have a pre-set potato and veggie every day.......I don't know how I feel about that. My BF got the Artic Char topped with spicy shrimp. I was so stuffed that I couldn't eat any of his, or about 60% of mine, for that matter. The dish reheated well the next morning. :) I know the specials change, but I don't think its that difficult to post them on the website, since, as someone else stated, there are more specials on the wall than food on the menu.

The host did say that there might be some cancellation so he suggested we wait for 10 more minutes. That was fine.  And then 5 minutes later, 2 out of the 4 tables he was waiting for did come in. Okay, so there's 2 parties that still HAVEN'T showed up. BUT he went up to us and told us that we should look somewhere else to eat dinner at. Seriously?  That's fine because my family and I ended up going to Hugo's Frog Bar and spent over $200 in food.

2014-11-23,2.0,"So I've been to Glenn's three times. The place is nearly always packed and has a lot of great reviews so I had high hopes. I can't say I'll be going back anytime soon. First trip: I had the Bananas Foster pancakes. I suppose they were pretty good, although a little on the sweet side for me. Of course, what do you expect from a dish like that. I was slightly underwhelmed by the sauce though. I am more of a savory over sweets kind of guy when it comes to breakfast so I figured I just made a bad choice. Second trip: Evening diner, I got the chicken sandwich. I have never tasted a chicken breast so dry in my life. Again, I wrote it off thinking that breakfast must be their strong suit and that it must be an off night. Third trip: This is the trip that really made me decide I was done with Glenns. Even though I was seated at the counter it seemed to take a while for anyone to notice I was there. Finally I was able to order the biscuits and gravy, side of ham. I was a little disappointed with my first couple of trips but I thought I'd give it one more go. I really love biscuits and gravy so I figured they might be able to win me over.  Unfortunately their ""homemade biscuits"" tasted like they were made a few weeks ago. I believe they are homemade because even General Mills biscuits out of a can taste better. They were extremely dry and somehow seemed to have an unsavory burnt crust on both the tops and bottoms of the biscuits. The gravy was bland and there was not enough to make up for the fact that the biscuits were so dry. I believe they were microwaved. I believe the ham was just thick sliced deli ham heated up on a grill. I guess the scrambled eggs were good. And now for the service.... On the third trip I was seated at the open end of the counter right by the door to the kitchen and a station where bussers get plates, silverware, etc. Despite being in a very exposed location I never got a refill on my water, which I emptied shortly after the food came out! How is this possible? It certainly wasn't for lack of servers or bussers. I can't believe it went unnoticed the entire length of my stay. It also took quite a while for it to be noticed I was out of coffee. Even when it was refilled my empty water glass went unnoticed. Seriously inattentive service. What makes all of this worse is that a woman who appeared to be an owner or manager was standing behind the counter, like right in front of me the whole second half of my meal. How could she not have noticed? With all of the bussers and servers milling about you'd think you could at least get a refill of water. I don't think I'll be back.",0.9833,0.85,0.103,0.047,0.5166585956416466

2014-11-11,1.0,"It finally happened. I had such a negative experience at Glenns that I am writing my first review on Yelp. I can't speak to the food here, which based on other reviews is fantastic, I wasn't able to stay to find out. All because I had the audacity to walk in with my 5 month old daughter and her stroller.  We arrived to meet a friend, who had suggested Glenns earlier this morning and found the restaurant nearly empty and my friend had got us a table in the corner, leaving plenty of room for my daughter and her stroller. However, before I could even sit down, a server asked if I would be breaking down the stroller and putting my daughter, in her car seat, and balance her on a wooden high chair. Uh, not a chance would I be putting her safety in jeopardy for some eggs and bacon. After responding to the server that I would just place her stroller against the table and place the chair back against the wall out of the way, I was promptly told this was not acceptable and wouldn't be allowed to keep my daughter in her stroller (where she was passed out, BTW)  After explaining to the server I wouldn't be removing her from her stroller and placing precariously on a high chair, and that I was shocked by the very un-family-friendly treatment by a place that is supposed to be a family restaurant, and if I wasn't going to remove my daughter from her stroller. To the server's credit, she was clearly uncomfortable with the discussion and told me it was a small restaurant and it was the owner's rule, not her's, and seem genuinely afraid to lose her job if she let me keep the stroller in the restaurant. At this point, someone I believe to be a manager, informed me I wouldn't be able to keep the stroller in Glenns. I then left.  Regardless of the reason for the policy, to have such a un-family-friendly policy is ridiculous and I will never return to Glenns and hope my comments get the attention of the owner and alert other families to stay away from this place.",0.4211,0.876,0.063,0.061,0.49581196581196585
2014-11-09,4.0,"I have to drop a review singing the praises of the perch we had a while ago.  I have an aunt who grew up in Muskegon, and now lives in Phoenix but travels often for work. Every place she goes, especially in the Great Lakes area, she seeks out any restaurant with perch to compare it to the last. So when she visited on a Friday in Lent, which happened to be my birthday, Glenn's was the obvious choice.  She and I both LOVED our Lake perch. I have to say, as well, that I don't love seafood, almost never choose it over any other thing in the menu, but this time I finished my entire plate, even against my stomach's protesting. It was amazing, so well-done, not mushy, crisp on the outside and meaty on the inside, with scrumptious sides to balance it all out.  Turns out they are NOT BYOB, which hadn't been clear to me before. Handy.  The only negative bit was when we were queuing near the door to give our names for the table -- it's one of those places with standing room for four or so people to squeeze against a chalkboard wall, and that's all. The hostess was (I suppose understandably) a bit snippy, and we got sweaty and hungry crammed together, standing over diners trying to enjoy their meal.  Bottom line, it's a small place.

While today's service was mediocre the food was excellent as always. I ordered a Mimosa to drink and The Parmesan and Chive Scrambled Eggs with Sausage/Short Stack. Everything was delicious but I love their pancakes the most. I always recommend getting a Short Stack as a side because it's only $1.50 with a meal and you get two pretty much full pancakes with butter and powdered sugar.

They give you crackers and bread at the table, which is always a nice touch.

Why have a menu if your specials are the length of a menu? It was very difficult to pick a dish.  Our table shared a few appetizers. We had mussels, and crab cake (no not plural, I will discuss that later). The mussels were good, but they literally only brought out one tiny crab cake. Listen- if that is what the appetizer was supposed to be, that's fine. But we were clearly ordering to share with the table and the server should have explained how small the dish was.

It was raining and the traffic was horrible coming from the burbs so I called and asked if they could hold my reservation.  They said they will only hold it for 15 mins.  I literally raced to get there and literally was 1 minute shy of the extended 15 minutes.  The hostess tells us they gave away are table...I said ""when? We had 1 minute left"" as I looked around and saw all the tables with food on them already.  There was no line and  there was 1 table open that I asked if we could have and she said ""No, that's been reserved"" I said well so was ours but you gave that away and they're not here. So she seats us at the table and walks away saying ""Seriously some people are ridiculous!"" Okay...WTF?!! She obviously did not wait the 15 minutes and gave our table away exactly at the time it was for because nobody looked like they were settling into their tables!

That was a lot more expensive than the $30 we anticipated. The King crab was not bad.  A little salty and some were overcooked.  We all ate about 7 legs.  Mind you they weren't full legs, so almost $10 a half a leg.  It comes with parmesan corn that is tasteless and coleslaw.  I really enjoyed the coleslaw and ate 4 of them.  That was probably my favorite part of the meal.  I liked how they came around and offered you hot crab legs without you asking.

There could be improvements, though: the orange juice is far too expensive, and it's from concentrate; the scrambled eggs I had in the New Orleans Scramble tasted weird: too buttery and potentially imitation/powdered eggs. Unpleasant consistency. Also some of the staff seemed to be slightly unproductive, and service was a bit slow. I might write some of that off to it being Sunday morning, but the place wasn't totally full. Other than that, the Scrambler was delicious. Fresh (de-veined) tiger shrimp.

2014-08-21,2.0,"So here is my review and I need to say most of this comes from service.  The food is decent (not the best food I have had - there are better places in the area)   however, the service is another thing.   This is the second time I have been here this year.   Both times I have been greeted by an individual who asks me if I have a reservation.  When I tell her ""no"" she always says indifferently you can sit at the bar or outside.  After we pick the location she grabs menus and without saying another word slaps them on a table.  If you are the front of house please act like you want the client there. On this particular occasion the kitchen help spilled about 4 ounces of very hot broth(steaming in fact)  on my leg.  I understand that accidents happen and he did apologize and even brought a packet of burn ointment (as I was wearing shorts and it was pretty bad).    Not once did the waiter apologize, nor did anyone from management check to make sure that I was ok   in fact the waiter returned once to put down a $85 check.  He didn't even stop  walking - just set it down as he was walking by without even a thank you.    That's great service!!! So today I have a burn on my leg and a completely bad taste in my mouth about tis place.   I will never go back again....",0.9725,0.827,0.141,0.033,0.4888888888888888

We took a seat in the patio area on their mediocre patio furniture- plastic seats and steel tables- meh, maybe I'm being picky. After being given water by one of the service staff, we looked through the menu. I was confused by the fact that their seafood options are actually on a board inside the restaurant, rather than on the menu. After a while I got to the point where I defaulted to my safe option choice of burger, rather than being adventurous.  More concerning however was the extra wait time to place an order. Perhaps a little communication breakdown between servers, but when we asked the person who delivered our water to order, a new server (currently on another table) politely said they would be right with us.  The drinks I must say were great. Very unique selection of beers. The food (burger) I had was just OK. Nothing special. Again, should have tried the seafood... Overall, think it was just one of those days- maybe I should give it another go. But whole dining experience felt a bit clunky and thus uncomfortable.",0.9201,0.888,0.083,0.028,0.5172510822510822

2014-08-10,1.0,"If you want good seafood and have zero expectations on good service, look no further! My partner and I visited Glenn's Diner with a couple we recently met after a recommendation from a friend.  We got there and were greeted by Roy, apparently the manager for the night.  We could barely understand him (talked really fast) and he claimed to not know the menu very well, so we ordered and enjoyed our food. That's where the experience stopped being good.  Roy appeared visually frustrated when we asked questions about the menu and slight modifications to the menu, and was quite inattentive during the meal (it took several minutes even to track him down).  When he finally did come to the table, he interrupted our conversations.  We were there pretty much on his terms. To top the night off, Roy (without any notice on the menu or otherwise) informed us that we could not split the check as we wanted, and coudl only split the check in halves, thirds, and quarters.   This was a problem because my partner and I ordered only water, while the other couple ordered several beers, making the checks not equal.  We asked him if he could accomodate us, he refused and even went on to say ""well, I split bills with my friends all the time.""  Touche, Roy- you are a better man than we are. We left pretty upset, and my partner called to speak to the owner.  He initially spoke to the owner's wife who promised a call back (she lost his phone number after the call- red flag there!) and we called back and spoke to the owner (Larry).  Larry apologized and said he would ""take care of us"" if we came back in. The interesting thing is that Larry mentioned that with Roy (our server/manager from our first visit), you ""love him or you hate him.""  Interesting for a manager in a customer service industry- it's acceptable to have a manager who people hate?  This was confirmed by our waitress who claimed to be friends with him.  Another red flag! We came back in, and were greeted with a bottle of wine that one of the members of our party liked.  Too bad the rest of us didn't drink wine, but he got a free bottle.  We (and I think most people) interpreted ""take care of you"" as a complimentary meal, but no- not Larry and Glenn's Diner.  They give you a bottle of wine that you didn't ask for. Our trip when we went back was marginally better- good food again, but inattentive service and they even messed up our order in front of the owner. We asked Larry what ""take care of us"" meant beyond wine, and then our food came out and he adroitly sneaked back to the back office of the restaurant and didn't return.  Suspicious behavior for an owner... So in sum- great food, especially the seafood for which they seem to specialize (for dinner anyway).  But horrendously awful service (you go there on their terms, not on anyone else's!) that made the dining experience leave a bad taste in our mouths both times.   We will never go back- there are plenty of other seafood restaurants that give at least adequate service in Chicago.  Heck, even Bonefish Grill in Skokie cost the same and has decent service!",0.9888,0.802,0.134,0.064,0.44162037037037044

Well, we were up early and at 930 on a Sunday morning, there were plenty of folks dining but we were able to get a table easily.   Was really thinking that the kid would want pancakes as that is his favorite, but when he saw the wall of cereal he was in heaven and could not be swayed.  Sugar cereal with bright characters on the boxes? Yep, could not be swayed from his choice of Capn' Crunch Crunchberry. $5 for a bowl of cereal is kind of spendy, but it's a big bowl for a 3yr old and the smile on his face was worth it.  As for me, the Crab Cake Benedict was the prime directive. The crab cake was full of crab and less filling, just like the way I like it. Lots of lump blue crab. The dish though wasn't as hot as I wanted...almost like it sat for a while before coming to my table? The poached egg was a little overdone for my personal taste for poachiness.  The potato pancake was amazing! It was crisp on the outside and creamy potato on the inside.

Anyway, I met a friend and we ventured in for our very first visit!  I realize that Tuesday is all you can eat crab legs day, but I wasn't really in the  mood for that much food, so I elected to have the lobster roll.  This is not your ordinary lobster roll - it's on a french bun - which I really liked (I realize purists among us may be horrified that there's not hot dog bun here, but oh well!).  It was HUGE - I actually took half home.  On the side was a potato cake-ish thing that was so good - not greasy, very flavorful and nicely browned but really nice texture in the middle - not mushed up potato here!  I asked for a little ketchup on the side and after the server looked at me in horror, I realized he thought I was going to put it on the lobster.  That would be horrible!  But no, just a little for the potato. As others have mentioned, this isn't a cheap spot, but the seafood is fresh and I thought it was reasonably priced.  My friend had a 4-egg omelet which she enjoyed.   Wines are all the same price! Nice!  An excellent pour for $8 and an entire bottle for $33.  At first, I thought this might mean that they had lackluster wines, but no - good selection with some interesting finds, so if you have to have an Alsatian white with your lobster, by all means, this is the spot! Great service!  We didn't have a reservation, so we had to sit on the patio - which was fine, just loud due to the el passing by during rush hour.  So, for quiet dining, definite make a reservation or go really early.",0.9948,0.751,0.194,0.055,0.5244791666666667

2014-05-05,4.0,"four stars 'cause i'm cheap. and when i hear diner, i don't think five-star seafood joint. glenn's does actually have diner options, but i don't think i've every been able to sway myself from the chalkboard menu or the weekly specials.  i come here a couple times a year for tuesday evening celebrations for the all-you-can-eat alaskan king crab legs. everytime i show up it's a little more expensive, but i'd say it's worth it.  byob plus a bar is my favorite. wine served in juice glasses is equally awesome. very small-town feel with great food. brunch is pretty good, the best are the sweet options. savory is pretty standard. a little pricey for what you get in my book. service is typically really friendly, but make reservations and if you go during one of their specials expect to eat and run. we were once asked to leave five minutes after we finished our meal to make room for waiting patrons. i get that it's a tiny place and they're busy, but to be asked to move it along seemed like a stretch. to that, though, they also once sat us without reservations on a tuesday because we were in a hurry and could eat and leave before the reservation for that table actually came in - so points for being accommodating that time. i love that the food is great and it's a super casual place, though. i think i hit up brunch in sweats once and nobody looked twice. plus the mimosa is awesome.",0.9976,0.744,0.247,0.009,0.5780864197530865

I've been coming here for the last five years and I think year after year it gets even better.  My most recent visit, I had Artic Char which was pan seared to perfection in a spicy diablo shrimp sauce.  The sauce didn't keep the flavor of the Char from coming through, it was moist and tender.  Unbelievable!

My Best Gal's entree was better than mine.  Seafood pot pie.  The bold sea of seafood flavor was flowing throughout this dish, my friends.  I would be tempted to get this next time I stop by.

2014-03-23,2.0,"I've lived in this area off and on for more than 10 years now, and Glenn's Diner used to be one of my favorites. In fact, it was where I met my now-wife for a Valentine's date just before we began to get serious. Tonight was the third or fourth time we've tried to go back there since then. I say ""tried"" because on every previous occasion, we've been turned away because we didn't have a reservation (this happened even in the middle of the week). Tonight -- a Sunday evening -- we were able to get seated, but the combination of higher-than-remembered prices, being wedged in between two other tables that were no more than two inches away from ours, and the shrieking of a young child whose parents had brought her to this place quickly persuaded us to leave and go elsewhere. My hypothesis: Glenn's has been Check-Pleased. ""Check Please"" ruins every restaurant it visits. I'm sure that it's great for the restaurants it happens to: they get to jack up their prices (and, in some cases, their attitudes) and know they'll still get more customers than they know what to do with. For the customers with fond memories of what it used to be like, not so much. If Glenn's is still packing the house so reliably that it can demand reservations six days a week despite high prices and elbow-to-elbow seating, I guess it has no incentive to make going there any easier or more pleasant, so however good the food is -- and I remember it being quite good -- I can't foresee myself getting to enjoy it again anytime soon, if ever.",0.9887,0.809,0.146,0.044,0.43386473429951683

The crab cakes were great and actually had more crab in them than breading - a very pleasant surprise. The mussels were served in a rich, buttery wine sauce and were to die for!  Be sure to ask for additional bread to soak up the incredible sauce.  I had the corvina with crawfish drizzled with a roasted poblano pepper sauce and my girlfriend had the barramundi. I don't recall how hers was dressed but both dishes were amazing - perfectly cooked and seasoned just enough to highlight rather than cover the taste of the incredibly fresh fish.

Now, my sister's first thought was wow- good selection of dinner items on the blackboard, but rather expensive for a montrose avenue neighborhood place. So, I was hoping that the food would live up to the price.  All the dishes but one were still available. I had the cioppino, my sister the catfish and dad the grouper. All of these are fully loaded, generous portions of fish and the sides are very large as well - almost half a head of broccoli steamed and drenched in butter!  The side that was just OK was the shrimp stuffing on top of which the (perfectly fried) catfish laid on top of.  The shrimp was cooked well but the cornbread stuffing- Eh- just crusty and greasy.   A mash potato option underneath would have been just as well. These large dishes are calorie bombs- do not thing you are coming here to eat steamed fish with a side of air. NO- most of the fish dishes are made with rich ingredients and the portions plentiful.  We had no issue with service.  So as far as the price per plate goes, the servings and sides are generous, so at $18-25 Per plate, you pretty much get what you pay for.   Not a cheap meal - but a once in a while type treat.    My cioppino was insanely spicy- that should be made clear by all servers. Never had such a spicy cioppino, which is usually a dish with some kick. I don't have an issue with spicy, but the diners with me almost choked. Be warned!  All in all, I would say we had a great meal, a caloric one, but great. I would *almost* go so far as to say - no need to go to bob chinn's if you are looking for a fresh catch. Go here. Bob Chinn's has a more exhaustive menu so the comparison isn't totally fair - but fish to fish, dish to dish, I'd go here instead of trekking out to the suburbs to Bob Chinn's.",0.9938,0.777,0.168,0.056,0.5964599916212818

The large side of fruit was $4.99 on the menu.  Seeing that we were subbing this for fries we would assume that the cost would be less than $4.99.

We love to try new restaurants and are always willing to make a trip for a great restaurant. That being said, it took us about an hour to get there due to rush hour traffic and construction. We made it just in time for our reservation.  They have a large fish menu which made us both happy so we decided to order 4 or 5 dishes for take out after dinner...sounded like a great idea we thought...  We ordered the All You Can Eat Crab Legs. WELL WHAT A BIG SCAM!!!!!! Get this everyone...you do not get a crab cracker you get a small fork.  They continually push the sides and want you to keep eating them.  The plate finally comes and has the sides and TWO....THAT'S RIGHT 2...CRAB LEGS. We were ok with that except that when you ask for more THEY GIVE YOU ONE...1...LEG AT A TIME AND THEN YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR SOME GUY TO BRING IT WHO IS NOT YOUR WAITER. HE JUST WALKS AROUND GIVING ONE CRAB LEG AT A TIME. Anyway, the wait between getting another crab leg was an average of 15 minutes. So here is what happened, once we were served our FIFTH...5th....CRAB LEG WHICH BY THEN WE HAD DECIDED WAS OUR LAST, AN OLDER MAN CAME OVER TO OUR TABLE.  I DO NOT KNOW IF HE IS THE OWNER OR THE MANAGER.

IT WAS CLEAR THAT HE DID NOT WANT US TO EAT ANYMORE.  ""MOVE ALONG""...ARE YOU KIDDING ME.  WE WERE NOT NOISY DURING THE EVENING AND ONLY HAD SOFT DRINKS AS WE BOTH HAD TO WORK THE NEXT DAY. HOW INSULTING IS THAT???  I have been to so many upscale restaurants not only in Chicago (as we live here) but in New York and Miami (where we have a condo). We inquired if there was a problem. He stated that we have been there an hour and a half (because it talks 15 minutes each time you want another crab leg) and that a lot of people are waiting for tables.  When he walked away we looked around. There were three empty tables and NO ONE WAS WAITING.  I have made it a point to tell all of my friends and colleagues about this place.  DO NOT GO HERE. THEY DO NOT DESERVE OR APPRECIATE YOUR BUSINESS. THERE ARE SO MANY RESTAURANTS IN CHICAGO THAT KNOW HOW TO TREAT PEOPLE.  I DO NOT WANT ANY OF YOU OR ANYONE THAT I KNOW TO EXPERIENCE THIS.

Rarely have I found a place I enjoy going for both brunch and dinner so I'm sure I'll be back here many times.  Brunch: You can get some typical bfast fair like eggs or you can go with their specials, which I recommend. I really enjoy the New Orleans Scramble, but everyone I've gone with enjoys their meals as well.  Dinner: It is pricey, but they say the fish is brought in fresh everyday and it does taste fresh. I highly recommend the mussels as an appetizer. The Jambalaya is always good, although the portion is HUGE. The Halibut is also pretty good. I've also had the BBQ Shrimp and while it was good its probably been the least favorite of the meals I've gotten here. Also, while pricey ($55/person), the all you can eat Alaskan King Crab on Tuesdays is pretty great. Service &Atmosphere: While I've always liked the servers as they are friendly and helpful they've always been a little inattentive. The place is small and you might think two servers for the whole place is enough, but while it's small they've crammed a lot of tables into that small space.  I really think they need one more server at busy hours. Since there are a lot of tables in a small space everything it is a little tight so if it's nice out I recommend eating outside. Also always make a reservation for Tuesday nights, brunch, or anytime you are bringing a group larger than 4.  Alcohol: The wine and beer list is pretty small but it is BYOB for a $5 fee.

2013-08-22,5.0,"A few months ago, I had an intense craving for crab legs. I had flashbacks of stacking my plate with snow crab as high as I could at an all you can eat $10.99 Chinese buffet I used to frequent when I was a kid. Granted, it was bad quality and frozen, I loved it all the same.  I stumbled across Glenn's Diner and their Tuesday All-You-Can-Eat crab  deal. I had been thinking about going for the past few weeks, but the 55 dollar price tag always deterred me. For some reason, I decided to pull the trigger last night and check it out... I was in heaven. WORTH EVERY PENNY! It was some of the most delicious crab I've ever had in my life. You know the giant Alaskan King Crab legs sitting on ice at Whole Foods that cost about $30/lb? Imagine that, except: larger, cooked to perfection, and .....literally as much as you can stomach.  The sides were also amazing. Simple corn on the cob, but dusted in a fine coating of parmesan cheese. I don't know that I'll ever be able to look at corn on the cob the same way after eating this version. The slaw was good too - a nice crunch and some acidity to clean off the palate after a round of giant butter glazed crab meat. The server did a nice job checking in to see if we would like another round of crab, but that was the extent of his interaction with the table.. Not that I'm asking for 5 star service, but if I'm dropping 150 bucks on dinner, it would be nice to have some sort of friendly dialogue or enthusiasm other than, ""Welcome.. Can I get you a drink? Okay.. Do you know what you want for an entree?"" Aside from that, the host staff were incredibly friendly, both on the phone (make a reservation if you're trying to get in on a Tuesday) and in person. Definitely made us feel very welcome. Also, shout out to the food runner in the Red Sox hat that kept refilling us with crab. Not that he spoke any more than a few words.. maybe an ""enjoy"" and a smile here and there, but had a great attitude. Super friendly.. It's always nice to see someone happy to do their job. Food was a SOLID 10 out of 10 as far as Tuesday nights are concerned. If you're a crab fan, this will go above and beyond your expectations in quality and certainly quantity.

I called for reservations at this neighborhood Chicago 'place' (I cannot use the word restaurant) from NYC so that we might have a first meal with children and grandchildren. The doctrinaire arrogance with which we were treated changed a happy family time into a rushed, unpleasant ordeal.

2013-08-16,1.0,"What happened here? My husband and I have lived in the neighborhood for 5 years and used to come here all the time. Since Glenn left, we've gone back a handful of times and have been increasingly disappointed. The food has lost its flavor, and the servers just seem to be unhappy.  Last night probably sealed the deal on our never coming back, unfortunately. We made reservations for a group of 6 (and a high chair), and even with the reservation they would not seat us until the entire party was present. This was never an issue under the previous ownership, and they weren't even remotely apologetic or sympathetic about it. We were hoping that the members of our party that got there on time would order for the whole table  - which we told them - but they wouldn't budge. Once we were seated, the waiter (who is a veteran from the Glenn days) jumped right in to how the menu works. I already knew what I wanted - a veggie burger, which is pretty much all I order here when it's not breakfast time - and I had checked the menu online earlier that day to make sure they still served it. We placed our orders, but when I requested the veggie burger, I was told they didn't have veggie burgers. Period. I was a bit taken-aback since it didn't occur to me to look at the menu in person since I SAW IT ONLINE, so I mentioned that it was currently on their online menu. Without hesitating, the waiter said, ""The website hasn't been updated in over 4 years"" and waited for me to pick something else. So you get rid of probably the only healthy and vegetarian item on your menu, don't update the menu online (or at least take the menu offline), and then aren't even remotely accommodating about it? I wound up ordering a side of sauteed broccoli, which wasn't fully cooked. All things considered, if the food's good, then you've at least got a happy belly - however the majority of the food was mediocre at best. The good: the teenagers at our table loved the ribs, so were perfectly happy with their meal. The bad: The pork chop my husband ordered may have been the worst he's ever had. And he'll eat ANYTHING. It was overcooked and dry, not to mention flavorless. The swordfish my father and his wife both ordered was super-dry, but at least had some flavor. To his credit, the waiter did point out that the ""dessert"" cereal that one of the teens at our table ordered had gluten in it, and as she had mentioned that she has a gluten allergy, this was a really considerate thing for him to do. He looked up the ingredients, without our prompting, and offered a couple of other gluten-free cereal options. He certainly didn't have to do that, so I definitely appreciate it. All told, however, this really was an unpleasant dining experience, and I'm sad to say I think our days with Glenn's are over. We love to support our neighborhood businesses, and really gave Glenn's as many chances as we could, but the fact that they didn't make any efforts to work with us and make it a better meal really left the worst taste in our mouths.",0.9958,0.799,0.147,0.054,0.524720634920635

Glenn's has a great menu of seafood which all of us ordered.  KT and I shared a crab cake appetizer that was very good.  The cake itself was tender with enough crab.  It is not large, but we each had a few bites, which was enough.  It is served with a sauce and shredded lettuce.  I dressed the lettuce with lemon and then the whole thing with the sauce and it really tasted good.

Lobster Fettucini Alfredo - On the other hand KT's order of this was better than the Seafood Bisque.  It was richer and creamier.  I would choose this for sure. Arctic Char - My was also decent, not exceptional.  The fish was nicely done and was moist.  Char is more like trout in flavor than salmon, which is fine for me.  I just felt it needed a little more seasoning. Grilled Swordfish - AT and KTBF both ordered this and it was the worst of the night.  The fish was grilled to the point of bitterness and as AT called it, ""not good bitterness"".   Sturgeon - Aunt Sue ordered this and I managed to get a taste.  With a cream sherry bacon mushroom sauce I really liked it.  This is rich and would be good to share.

Baramundi - Uncle Mike ordered this and ate two bites.  We really don't know if it was good or not, he doesn't eat much more than that. Glenn's is a good place for some fresh seafood and is to be commended for that.  I am making this four stars, but it is a little weak due to significant low spots (over charred swordfish).  You need to find your favorites and they will be good.

They were cut into strips, pan fried and served with a cocktail sauce and a fresh lemon wedge. It was simple and delicious. We then, based off our server Nate's suggestion, ordered the blackened Aussie Barramundi fish dinner served with the classic and always delicious potato pancake and broccoli along with the crab cake dinner served with the spicy corn and coleslaw. Holy sweet Jesus it was amazing. Everything tasted so fresh and vibrant and it was a celebration of flavor. Along with the food being excellent, I cannot speak more highly of the service we received. Nate was enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and super attentive without hovering or being overbearing. He suggested that we try each other's dishes and it couldn't have been a better call.

Fresh seafood and chalkboard specials Crab cakes: awesome!!!  Love the sauce they serve it with, doesn't overpower the plentiful crab meat. The clam chowder knocked my socks off!!  I've never been a huge chowder person, but fortunately decided to try it today and boy am I glad I did. Cleverly, the cup portion is served in an actual coffee cup.

I don't think either of us realized how much a half lb of fish was until it plopped down on the table. Talk about bang for your buck!  He got the trout  which was cooked wonderfully.

First, given the size of the place (very small) I was impressed that they were able to accommodate a group our size (12) on a Friday. At the last minute, they even granted our request to add a person & adjust the time of our reservation. They seemed a bit strict with the seating only full parties & only holding tables for 15 minutes, but since they get so busy & it's tiny, I understand. Everyone was happy with their food. I've been here at least two times before & have thought that the food was good but some dishes fell flat (I can't recommend the shrimp-cargot---far too cheesey). We were all happy this time! I had the catfish blackboard special (lightly breaded over corn bread & shrimp stuffing) & it was perfect -- fresh, flavorful & delicious. Salads (sea food salad & vegetarian spinach salad) were a hit, as were the crab cakes, scallops, & grilled salmon.  Soup was a bit too salty for my taste. Kids were happy with their burger & mac & cheese, which was smokey & much more flavorful than the typical straight-out-of-the-box stuff that passes at other restaurants. Service was fine.

I've always enjoyed the quirky menu that combines seafood and diner fare, but I may not return after a particularly disappointing experience. We stopped by for an early dinner on a Sunday afternoon, but as soon as we entered, we noticed that they had the music turned up unusually loud. It was like walking into a bar rather than a family dining establishment. Classic rock drowned out the conversation. I politely asked one of the nearby servers if they could turn down the music. His response was less than friendly although he agreed to do so. It was not turned down, so I mentioned it to our waiter who indicated that it was fine the way it was. We opted to leave and find someplace else to spend our money. I've always loved the food at Glenn's, but I don't see the point of spending almost thirty dollars a plate for seafood if I can't hear my dining companions due to the fact that Bob Seger is being blasted by the waitstaff.

Usually I'd order dessert, but I was already too full from the fish.  They offer standard diner fare: key lime pie, chocolate brownie, apple pie, carrot cake (sold out), and pecan pie among other things.  You could also order cereal for breakfast - they offer over 25 different cereal brands all day.

The problems began as soon as I witnessed the staff playing toss in back service area with limes in cups, letting them drop to floor then picking them up without a thought. Next strike was a waiter eating with his fingers in the same area and then capped off off by a busboy almost walking onto to floor with food on his face, only to be luckily stopped by the lime tossing busboy and told to wipe his face. The negative experience worsened with the food, I order a simple piece of fish that grossly over cooked and dry. The server did replace the dish with another choice that was obviously ""soaked' in butter by the chef or whomever was in the kitchen to assure I didn't return it a second time. The worst 2 pieces of $20 of frozen fish I've ever had. I would have preferred to eat frozen sticks to this meal. The general lack of management was evident, the only thing that was not evident was why people write such strong reviews and go to this place. My recommendation would be to try Half Shell in Lincoln park - or a local Red lobster or Long John Silver's or even the local supermarket Jewel for some fish sticks. Bottom line, over priced, over rated and the service and staff is extremely non professional. I had the strange feeling of being talked about as a problem customer by the back staff.

2012-12-12,4.0,"As much as I dislike Guy Fieri and everything he stands for, he picked a winner with Glenn's diner.  The name of the game here is slimy-yet-satisfying diner fare, plus 16 no nonsense fresh fish preparations. Virtually all are served in butter or cream sauces, which ordinarily puts me off, but many of these options are so creative that I didn't mind. All come with fresh steamed asparagus and roasted baby potatoes; simple but perfect accompaniments Walleye ($19.99) is crusted in pretzels and pan-fried; this came unsauced, but the fish was so perfectly cooked, and the crust so unique, that the fish didn't miss it remotely. River sturgeon ($25.99) is a thick, impressive piece of fish, served with a bacon mushroom cream sauce, which is every bit as rich as it sounds and is well worth every calorie. Arctic char ($21.99), has a mild salmon-y flavor that is complemented well by a perfectly balanced spicy tomato cream sauce, and comes topped with five (superfluous, but tasty) shrimp. Cioppino ($21.99) here consists of hunks of salmon and whitefish, clams, and mussels in a tomato and vegetable broth, is somewhat bland, although the garlic bread makes up for the flavor deficit to some degree. This was a bit of a disappointment, but the other offerings definitely more than made up for it.  Pricing is a little high, but hey, you're eating seafood 1,000 miles away from the nearest ocean, so you can't complain much. Service is imperfect; a party that was supposed to be behind us was seated ahead of us, which resulted in a half an hour wait. Why am I not complaining about this? The staff comped our entire table 22 oz bombers of Revolution's exceptional Christmas ale to compensate. This is Chicago after all, so bribes are never discouraged.

Let's get the bad outta the way since it's only two small things (really just one), then we can dive into the good: 1) The price can add up quickly if you go for dinner. They have a great seafood selection and that's just the way you have to roll if you want good seafood. 2) It's almost impossible to decide what to order. Usually, In places with great, appealing menu items, I'll get down to 2 options that I know will be good and then make a game time decision. At Glenn's, I am still regretting what I didn't order or what I could have ordered the next day... and that's WITH me having thoroughly enjoyed what I DID order. Just too many great options. It's the ultimately ""grass is always greener"" effect in menu form. I'm sitting there enjoying my chicken and waffle, but I see my friend also really enjoying his shrimp and grits. No! It's not fair. I almost want to order two items, but know that would be the biggest mistake. Portions are huge! I'd basically just be ordering one of the items to go... which wouldn't be that bad but definitely excessive. I'm not trying to weigh 300 lbs here. Ok, on to the good (just to list a couple): 1) Brunch. I could stop right there, but I guess I'll elaborate a tad. If you're like me... and most people on Yelp. You're always looking for that go-to place to take people to brunch. Something that is tried and true, and will leave your friend from out of town fulfilled and jealous that they don't get to eat this more often like you. This is one of those places you can put on your short list. If your brunch crew is more local, then you're always looking for that extra place to throw into the rotation so you don't feel like you're stuck in a rut or begin to like that place you love a little less because it's turned routine rather than a treat. Let's be real. No matter how much you like a place, options are always a good thing... even if it's only so you can have it to choose your favorite place over the other option. 2) Service/Setting. I'm combining these two, because they create a place that's just laid back and perfect for a Sunday where you just don't want to do much of anything. The reality here being that that's most every Sunday. The wait staff are friendly and attentive (but not overbearing). If it's your first time, then they'll walk you through their many, great items. If you don't fill like filling up, then your friends can stuff themselves and you can just have some coffee and pie or cereal and juice and feel just as comfortable. Make sure to try: chicken and waffle, New Orleans scramble, shrimp and grits, crab cakes, seafood strudel, any seafood really, pulled pork benedict, biscuits and gravy, their desserts... actually just point at the menu randomly and enjoy that.",0.9984,0.742,0.208,0.05,0.5621307945526696

2012-06-24,4.0,"I was blown away by my trip to Glenn's last night for dinner. I was quite the skeptic thinking that a place could be this popular/well rated for serving *fresh* seafood in the Midwest. Needless to say, I gave into all of the recommendations and four to five star reviews on Yelp and gave it a try.  Here are some things to note if you're going to venture to Glenn's: 1) ABSOLUTELY make a reservation. We tried to come here a few times over the last few weeks and faced a rather long wait. There was a constant stream of people waiting for a table when I was here on a Saturday, so do yourself a favor and make a reservation.  2) Limited beer/wine menu, but not bad. In my opinion it's better than paying their rather steep corkage fee for BYOB. Please note that you can't enjoy your BYOB beverages outside for some reason. 3) It's pretty pricey, after tax and tip for two people it was about $90. Alrighty, that being said, here's a breakdown of what we ordered: Appetizer: Crabcake--this was outstanding. Again, I was very skeptical when we ordered the $9 crabcake. It was rather small, but absolutely worth it. It was simple, meaning that it literally was just crab meat and spices, but I enjoyed being able to taste/experience the crab and not have it bogged down with fillers. My boyfriend and I took several tiny savory bites and it was over far too soon. Although it seems expensive, it was quality and I would order it again. Entrees: 1) Scallops: These were served in a sherry cream sauce with mushrooms and were a nice buttery non-gritty texture that ensures quality seafood. For $23 we received six scallops that were delicious. These didn't have the tell-tale flash frozen/old ""fishy seafood"" aroma that so many restaurants try to mask and fail at. It was incredibly fresh and rich, and I'm still drooling at the thought of them. Highly recommended. 2) The red snapper: Fan freaking tastic. It was well seasoned and had a great tomato based cream sauce on top of the fish. This didn't ""cover up"" the taste of the fish like so many restaurants seem to do... it greatly accentuated the flavor and made me a fan of snapper. There isn't much more to say about this dish than incredible. Both of the seafood dishes were served with properly steamed broccoli and five or six small potatoes. I liked how there wasn't a carb over-kill in regards to the sides. I was full and satisfied. Although, that being said, we absolutely had to try a dessert here. We chose the key lime pie, which was about a quarter of a large pie. We inhaled this pie in about a minute--it was that good. Each bite was sickly sweet followed by a punch in the mouth of sour lime, the proper way a key lime pie should be. It was nestled in a graham cracker crust and topped with a hearty amount of whipped cream. Hell, I would come here for a slice of that pie on its own... and I'd probably wait in line 1-2 hours for it. Yes, it's that good, and yes, you should get it. The only reason I knocked off a star is due to the staff. Our waiter was nice, but they seemed to have a surplus of bus boys/runners/etc and were still running incredibly slow when it came to refills, service, and running the check. They just don't seem to have this down, but with such a high demand for their food maybe they just don't care. Outside of that one issue, it's definitely worth a visit. I can't wait to come back and try their brunch menu.",0.9976,0.802,0.154,0.044,0.5124218020541551

2012-06-13,4.0,"Glenn's Diner is pretty fantastic with sublime diner food, a cereal bar, and great breakfast options, but where Glenn's really shines is it's AMAZING seafood. Yes, there is an extensive menu including sandwiches, salads, breakfasts, etc.  But take my advice and check out the blackboard listing all the various seafood options.  You won't regret it.  The trout with brown sugar pecan butter is delicious.  The pretzel encrusted walleye is ridiculously good.  And the catfish...oh, the catfish...served with a corn bread shrimp stuffing...it is drool worthy.  The sea scallops are outstanding and come with a bacon, mushroom, cream sherry sauce that is the definition of happiness.   If I could afford to eat Glenn's seafood everyday, then I would.  But, sadly, this girl is on a budget, so Glenn's wall of seafood is only a rare treat.  Most visits involve the more budget friendly options found in the actual menu.  The clam chowder is very tasty, and I can't say no to a grilled cheese sandwich.  Then, of course, there is breakfast served all day.  Chocolate chip pancakes?  Don't mind if I do.  Eggs and bacon?  Yes, please.   A word to the wise:  Glenn's is very popular, largely due to the excellent food and also slightly due to appearances on Check, Please and Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  This means that Glenn's is even busier than ever.  This, coupled with a small dining room, means that tables can sometimes be hard to come by.  If you are going during peak hours, then it is always smart to make a reservation in advance if you don't want to be either turned away or asked to wait forever.  If, however, you don't want a reservation and just want to walk in, then you need to be cool with a late lunch or an early dinner during non peak hours.",0.9974,0.735,0.231,0.035,0.6388392857142857

The drain in the bathroom with the sharp edges that sticks up about two inches from the ground and as Bryan Adams would say ""cuts like a knife?""  Well that part of my experience was far less than satisfactory.  When stepping up to the sink to wash my hands, I sliced my foot open and was left bleeding profusely on the bathroom floor.  With nothing but paper towels and water, I attempted to clean up the floor and my injury as best I could and made my way back to my table with a make shift paper towel cast and wells of tears in my eyes.   To make a long story short, the food was good but I can't even review it because it was completely overshadowed by the consequences of having a death trap in the bathroom.  I would be surprised if I was the only person to injure themselves whether it be a stubbed toe, or even just an embarrassing trip.  My server came over and apologized but I have to say, after the amount of embarrassment I experienced on the porch as I attempted to control the bleeding while other diners were eating just feet away most likely disgusted, I guess I thought Glenn's would be kind enough to comp our drinks or offer a discount for the inconvenience.  That's not typically my style...but in this case, I was mortified.  We were five seconds from leaving because we felt so bad that people had to observe some girl tending to her bleeding foot - in a word, appetizing.  They should have been happy we even stayed and spent any money at all.

I could go on into a long and deep length about how I always enjoy the atmosphere, the friendly staff and the presentation of everything at Glenn's. I could further go on about the depth of the menu and how everything I've ever tried here has hit the spot. I could also mention how every time I have out of town guests this is where I like to take them and we've always had a great meal. But I'm not going to mention those things. I'm going to talk about the last thing I ate there. I was dead set on having my Crab Cake Eggs Benedict but a recommendation from the waiter sounded so disastrous that I just had to try it: Seafood Strudel. Seafood Strudel? Strudel is a desert? One I typically don't care for... how are they going to merge that with seafood I love? I read the menu description:Shrimp, crab, hardboiled egg, cheese, pastry, topped with mushrooms and hollandaise sauce. ""This could be terrible... Why am I considering this?"" I thought. I order, it arrives. You know what happens next right? I mean you saw the 5 stars above right?  It defies all odds. It's wonderful. It's one of the tastiest things I've eaten in months. Savory, complex flavors and filling. Mixed with a side serving of spinach... it's just tremendous. My girlfriend asks me ""Better than the Crabcake Eggs Benedict?"" My pause to ponder this surprised her...  ""I don't know. All I do know is that before this weekend is over I'm writing Glenn's another 5 star Yelp review.""",0.9321,0.844,0.104,0.051,0.5029075091575093

2012-04-25,1.0,"It hurts my heart to give Glenn's Diner one star.  The clam chowder is phenomenal and, until last month, it really felt like a warm and inviting atmosphere.  For the third week in a row, I darkened Glenn's doorstep for delicious food and fun.  The third time is definitely not the charm. We felt a little rushed initially, even though it was a Monday.  After having a hectic day, a relaxing dinner was what I wanted with one of my favorite gal pals.  However, it gave dine and dash a new meaning.  Before we finished our meal (clocking at almost an hour at this point, for reference), we noticed that five water glasses were staring at us (waiting for our table).  When we asked if we could get one more beverage, we were told that they would gladly serve it to us if we moved to the bar.  Huh?  We a) had not totally finished with our bill and b) noticed that four tables of people who had been there prior to our arrival were still there.  And, of course, our server said that she was also the manager on duty when we requested to express our concerns to a manager. I have never experienced something like that before.  And the hard edge is that they clearly did not care if I made it a fourth week in a row or not.  That being said, I am waving a fond farewell to the clam chowder.  Glenn's will never get my 20+% tipping or my good vibes again.  One star is for the memories.  If Glenn's is concerned about servicing more people vs. the quality of the experience, it should open up a drive-thru diner instead.",0.9786,0.845,0.124,0.032,0.44567550505050496

I was a little shocked a restaurant would reserve the whole place and annoyed, but we sat at the ""bar"" to eat. We had a wonderful fish spread for an apptizer, but it was served with Ritz Crackers, yuck. We asked for the basket of crackers and ate it with those instead. For a main course, the fish pot pie was wonderful, warm, great crust but a little small in size for the price, but once I saw how many shirmp were inside, decided it was a good deal. Other meal was pretzel encrusted fish, so good. Only thing the veggies on the side were undercooked and when I mentioned to the server behind the bar he replied, ""That can't be right, they cook those through all the time"" What, do you think I was lying?  Service was very good except for that comment. Server took the food and its presentation almost too personal and was very excited over the menu, nice guy but gave out weird vibe. Things to know about this place: This was the ""worst"" experience I ever had here and still the food was awesome, so in summary, you can't go wrong, even on a bad day its great!

The staff was charming and delightful, although there were several people standing around doing nothing who could have refilled water, wine, etc. I am not really a big fan of those places that list a chunk of ""fresh fish"" etc. on a board for $20-25 each. The Cioppino (sp?) sounded good, which I like, but was warned it was spicy. Jambalaya as well was described as hot, which I was not in the mood for. So I had the mahi mahi, which was good, bathed in a gingery sweet glaze. The bottom line is I wouldn't go back. Just really wasn't satisfying for the effort. If I'm paying like $50+ each including some wine and a salad and dessert I'd like a more chill, upscale relaxed atmosphere with professional service. Maybe good bread, etc? You can get it all a la carte, but it adds up. It adds up to being a pretty expensive evening, and really not that pleasant of an experience.

The base of the pot pie was assorted seafood that was covered in a mornay sauce. It was baked to perfection and served with mushrooms on top. I think the combination of the mushrooms and mornay over powered the seafood a little bit. I like mushrooms so it wasn't a total downside. I noticed there was a spicy undertone to the dish. The more I had the more I noticed it. I am sensitive to spice but this didn't keep me from eating it.  One of my girlfriends had the jambalaya, one had the white fish and one had the swordfish. All were thrilled with their dishes.  For dessert, I had a piece of the Golden Carrot Cake. I had high hopes but was disappointed. Nothing quite meets my gold standard for carrot cake (Tavern, Libertyville).

For me, there were so many entrees to choose from I asked our server several questions to narrow it down.  He was really helpful and knowledgeable.  Finally decided on the scallops and was not disappointed.  I was surprised they were only $21, not bad at all.  I started with a cup of chowder that was the best chowder I've ever had.  Period.  Not kidding ~ it was that good.  The scallops arrived and were they ever tasty.  Nicely seared on each side, covered with mushrooms and bacon bits and a light butter/wine sauce with just a little hint of garlic..  It was kind of like eating a scallop steak!  The broccoli was crisp and well prepared.  I couldn't eat it all.  Never do I take seafood home, but this was so darn good I just couldn't leave it.  It's quite a drive from my house, close to an 1.5 hours.  I'm willing to make that drive to go back!

We were not able to order an appetizer because there was nothing available without garlic which I am allergic to. This is a pretty common scenario for me so no big surprise.

The only disappointment was the portion size. For $26 I was served a  1"" x 3.5"" slice of fish and was charged another $3 for an extra side of the sauce to fix up the bland sides.

I mean this is a diner serving primarily seafood, more than 16 different daily specials in the meat-and-potato Midwest United States. Are they out of their mind? This is almost unheard of in Chicago. And then they have the guts to serve not just seafood, but also cereal and breakfast. Wow, I like these guys already! If you've live in Chicago, you know how hard it is to find quality seafood at an affordable price. You almost always can't get both. Well, at Glenn's, you can. First of all, the prices are a bit more expensive for seafood items, naturally. So, don't expect $5.95 for a fish meal. But them being a diner, they are definitely more affordable compared to other restaurants. Everything on the menu was so tempting; they've got crab cakes, halibut, blue marlin, perch and others. I don't remember if I got the walleye, sole or yellow perch but it was simply pan fried and served with a side. The fish was seasoned correctly but it tasted a bit fishy. I wasn't sure if it was fresh enough. Presentation was simple and straightforward, just what I expected from a diner. For $16-$20, I felt there was something missing from the dish though. Despite the fishiness, Glenn's gets an A for prominently featuring so many choices of seafood in a low key setting.

THE SEAFOOD IS OUTSTANDING. I would give 5 stars, but the noise level is what keeps me from doing so. Okay, 4 and a half... Here it is....It totally reminds me of dining in Key West. Excellent, upscale seafood entrees, served on small diner plates, substantial flatware, wrapped in paper napkins, plastic water glasses, and a casual, laid-back attitude and atmosphere. I personally LOVE that about Glenn's. I love awesome, fresh food and not having to dress up for it.  About the food this time: I had the blackened barramundi. It was perfectly cooked, tender and delicious, with a hint of sweetness in the butter. Perfect with a squeeze of lemon. It came with a tasty potato pancake and sauteed zucchini and red onions. The veggies were freshly cooked al dente. Yay! This is so important and many restaurants treat the sides like an after-thought. Not Glenn's. YUM. Hubby had the prezel-encrusted walleye, which was good, but not as good as mine, but that's only my opinion. I tend to like a more delicate fish. The walleye was quite substantial and is for a very big appetite. We split a piece of pie. They switched bakeries. No more Hoosier Mama, but now Bull's Eye Bakery (I think). It was pretty good. I noticed that they actually grade their ice cream on the menu. For those of you who may see this, it says 16%, which is the content of butterfat in the product....Haagen Das is about 24%, for comparison. I like that they pay attention to stuff like this.

They said 20 minutes, so we went back outside to join the other drifters patiently waiting for their numbers to be called. 15 minutes later, they called our number (a plus for them). I am a complete breakfast food snob, and so I judge restaurants harshly based on their breakfast/brunch menu. Bacon, eggs and pancakes all the way. The eggs were light, fluffy and perfectly scrambled, and the bacon was crisp and perfect. My fiancé ordered the cioppino and the crab cakes (since Glenn's is known for their seafood selection). The cioppino was superb, the crab cakes were...interesting. There were were almost like coleslaw crab cakes, which was a unique twist, but not one I enjoyed, and I love my crab cakes. Overall, I will be coming back if only to sample the awesome-looking dish that this table of guys ordered. Literally, their waiter brought it out, and the smell was wafting over to us like a Pepe Le Pew. And the seafood list looks quite impressive, and they have barramundi on their menu (best fish to eat EVER)!",0.9907,0.804,0.167,0.028,0.5434027777777778

OK, ok, ok...twist my arm.  So actually after my last review...Glenn contacted me and asked to come in again...on his dime to try it again.  I thought this was a very nice gesture.  Furthermore, he didnt want to know when I was coming in...again, I thought, wow this guy really cares about his restaurant.  Not to mention, he believes in it and believes that we came in on an off night...had an off experience, etc.  So how could I turn it down?? We hopped on the brown line and headed up there on a Friday night, date night.  We were sat promptly, right by the door.  The place is really small.  Glenn's is very much a kitsch-y feel kind of place.  The fishes/specials are on the chalkboards, which again, is cute...however, if people are standing/sitting in the way, you cant see what there is.  I have to say, I remember the DDD episode and supposedly they have a menu that changes...well, we went there two months ago and everything looked the same...so I am not sure how often the menu changes...maybe less frequently.   Anyway, our server was promptly at our table taking our drink order, water on the table, crackers to munch on.  We were looking over the app menu and had some questions about some things because the chalkboard doesnt offer much description on the apps.  Our server...I cant remember the name...J....julia...julie...I dont know...anyway, she provided great descriptions of everything we asked about.  We decided on the calamari and the clam chowder (last time, we ordered the chowder...it never made an appearance).  The calamari was unlike anything I have had...it was fantastic.  It was made out of a steak, lightly breaded and pan fried.  The chowder was thick, creamy, lots of clams and bacon.  It really was fantastic diner style.  J (since I cant remember her name) was personable...she sat down with us before we placed our entree order and was down to earth and talked about what we were looking for.  I was like, maybe we did have a bad night, a bad experience... After we placed our orders for our entrees...that was the last we saw of J until we were done with our entrees...AHHH, so frustrating!  We had to flag down the hostess to get us more drinks...the hostess brought them to us, menus under her arm, talking on the phone, etc...it was comical.  Yes, around 845-9PM the restaurant was really packed...I think maybe some tables were running over and there was a lot of people standing, waiting, looking impatient...but, again, not quite sure where our server went.   Next on to the entrees...we decided on the peel and eat shrimp and the barramundi.  Ok, so the peel and eat shrimp really had a great flavor...however, the dish itself looked very unappetizing.  The shrimp and rice were SWIMMING in a soup of grease and butter.  I mean, it looked like a soup.  To get the rice, you had to dip down deep into the greasy mix to pull out some.  However, the shrimp really was fantastic and it was a great price.  Also, we had to improvise on the shells of the shrimp because we hadnt seen J since we ordered our entrees...we put them in one of our empty wine glasses.  The barramundi...it was good.  Not bad, not fantastic...solid good.  Finally J came around and helped cleared our plates, got another drink and ordered some carrot cake.  It was definitely better than the previous pecan pie that we had ordered. Overall, I think it was an improvement from the last time.  Still needs some work on service.  The food was pretty good.  I really thought the apps were fantastic.  I think if I go back, I will make a meal out of mussles, calamari and clam chowder :)",0.9978,0.806,0.151,0.043,0.5115942302847064

The crabcake itself was delicious, everything together was complete utter harmony. They gave me the hollondaise on the side too which I greatly appreciated since I only like a small amount. My friends omlette and another friends breakfast sandwich were also great (foodie crowd, we share). Their sweet items were tasty too, I think we got their French Toast.

2011-12-09,3.0,"UPDATE (2/6/12): I was contacted by Glenn, who offered an explanation of his pricing decisions. While I still feel that the pricing needs work, I did remove an unfounded accusation from my initial review. Also, he offered amends, which I appreciate. _______________________________________________ Glenn's Diner was an okay dining experience, even though... The service was top notch. It's best to get reservations. It's not a large joint. Also, they won't seat you if your entire party isn't there. You'll have to saddle up to the bar, since standing in front of the chalkboard is likely awkward. Also, you may want to eat earlier than 8 p.m. because they will start posting ""OUT"" signs next to some of the fresh fish dishes. The BLOODY MARY ($8) in a pint glass was a meal, complete with a large shrimp on a skewer, cantaloupe piece (not as large as some pics on here), celery stick, and carrot stick. It was good, but it might be worth a splurge on top shelf liquors. Also, I didn't stir it enough or something because it was extra spicy toward the bottom.  The LOBSTER FETTUCCINE ($24) included plenty of large lobster pieces and four large texas toast, garlic bread pieces. It was enough for two meals. As the waiter said, it was good today and it'll be good tomorrow. I tasted my friend's dishes -- one had an interesting spicy corn side with a fish, while the other had Asian mahi-mahi. Also, one friend had the clam chowder (which includes bacon, so I couldn't partake), but she didn't exclaim that it was the best she ever had. So, why was it just an okay trip? My pescatarian verdict is that while GD knows how to cook fish, but I think the flavor is on the bland side. The descriptions on the blackboard sounded great, but then the execution of the dishes weren't as creatively flavorful.  As I like to do, let's talk price. Frankly, almost all of the main entrees were $20+. I know, fresh seafood isn't cheap. Yet I've had really good fresh fish entrees that were under $20 before. We split the bill evenly at $43 each. Ouch. I can't be too salty though, since I got two meals out of my order. I kind of wish that I'd hit The Southern again instead.

2011-11-19,2.0,"The story of my affair with Glenn's Diner goes as follows. This space used to be a crappy tapas place and when I saw a new ""seafood diner"" was opening in it's spot I got quite excited as I lived only a block away and needed an alternative to Caro Mio for dinner and LeSabre (RIP) or Golden Nugget for Breakfast/Lunch.  I patronized Glenn's within the first week that they were open and fairly regularly after that for breakfast, lunch, weekend brunch, and dinner. I loved that they have no deep fryer and that as the menu states ""iceberg will never be allowed through our doors."" the servers knew my face and I knew theirs. So many well cooked rotating fish specials on their chalkboard that there was often something new nearly every time I came. The word of mouth I gave this place was amazing, many of my friends also became lovers of Glenn's and we would meet there to hang out  and have a great piece of seafood or one of their creative sandwiches (I miss the Russian Rueben), heck, I even brought my Grandma here.  Then all of the sudden Glenn's got too big for their britches. Now, I'm not one to begrudge a place their success but it saddened me greatly that a loyal customer who patronized their restaurant since the first week could no longer get a table without waiting 30 minutes or more and then eventually it became impossible without a reservation (which they never used to accept until all the groups from outside of the neighborhood complained about having traveled so far to visit and not able to get a table). I used to be able to walk down the block and grab a quick bite to eat, and for dinner the tables were always full, why change from a first-come-first-served diner to a you ain't getting in without a reservation?  My visits to Glenn's tapered off slowly as it became more and more difficult to get a seat and the ""fame"" of various TV appearances went to their heads. Glenn's was always good for what it was, a funky neighborhood diner that cooked a great piece of fish but sadly I can no longer recommend them as both service and quality as well as basic respect for loyal customers went down the crapper. At this point Glenn's diner is no more than a slightly over-priced and much over-hyped shadow of its former self. You will still get a decent (not great) plate of food that you will pay (slightly) too much for but Glenn's has lost its magic and I am doubtful that I will return.

I've heard of restaurants that serve only cereal, but at Glenn's it seems to be a nice option for people who are too lazy to pour their own bowl at home.  For lunch the food is great.

I've had the grilled cheese and tomato, the BLT and the spinach salad.  Can't go wrong with any of those. One surprise was the potato pancake. I'm not a big potato pancake guy, but they threw one on my plate anyway, and before I could protest I was already stuffing it in my face.",0.9021,0.874,0.085,0.042,0.6595726495726496

Wanted to try their Cioppino but opted for the Seafood pot pie instead.  Shared with another, we both stopped in to satisfy a craving for a place we'd both heard so much about.  Both leaving with completely different views.  The pot pie ($20) looked fantastic, everyone I show the photo to always compliments and wonders about its taste.  It was a step better than the clam chowder is all I can think of.  A few more bits of seafood though still not anything different.  Alike the chowder it had a ton of cream and many chunks of potato.  A person sensitive to lactose should not choose any of these dishes, I regret to say I did not inquire with our waiter.  It  affected me greatly, in a bad way, I left running home quickly.  (LoL, I laugh now, but it wasn't funny that day) We stopped in on a late weekday afternoon, during the lazy which occurs just before the dinner rush.  Waitstaff was there for the order taking and first course but after that, very hard to locate.  It wasn't busy, we were one of three tables.  While I wasn't impressed with the food, I wonder what their other dishes could be like.  Specifically some fried fish or baked seafood, so, I think I might go back.   The atmosphere is of a neighborhood diner.  Menu is expansive trying to satiate the tastes of any that enter their doors.  So while your company might be lookin to satisfy their fishy cravings, you can get your eat on something else like a hamburger, sandwich or maybe some cereal.",0.9072,0.823,0.102,0.076,0.5351666666666667

The first two experiences were excellent! The staff was friendly, the food was good and the service was very efficient. Would have been 5 stars all around. NOW for the most recent visits, in the last 6 weeks (both times were for brunch) The last time we went we never actually sat and ate. The hostess was down right rude. It was pouring out and we were with our two kids. We had asked if our 2-1/2 year old son could just sit at the bar while we waited for our table (there was about 4 seats open). She said NO. They had to leave them open for people who wanted to eat at the bar. We even offered to move if people came in. On top of which there were multiple tables open, she claimed those were for people with reservations. Now I am all for reservations, but we were there for more than 10 minutes and the tables never became occupied. Hey Gleen, you know if someone doesn't show up for a res, it is good practice to give the table away and then put the people with the res to the top of the wait list when and if they actually show up. Needless to say we left. The most recent visit was this morning. We were smart enough to make a res.  I will say there were several open tables that never became occupied and I there was a nice size wait too. The food was good, but the service and dining experience was just not nice. We had asked the server if our son could just have a little glass of cereal while we waited for the main food (which we had been given the last times we had eaten there) She claimed new mgt did not allow for this. When we ordered we had asked for 3 types of cereal for our son (he was very excited for this). We were told new mgt only allowed 1 cereal choice. The sever was polite, but not what I would call friendly.  Needless to say, if you only care about the food then go. If you actually want service move on to another options.

2011-08-18,4.0,"At this writing, Glenn's Diner has 538 reviews. Glenn probably doesn't need to hear my opinion, especially since I'm now one of many, many fans. This review is for breakfast items only. A friend wanted to meet for lunch here. Initially, I was reluctant, because I know Glenn specializes in seafood, and I think all fish, crustaceans, mollusks and the other assorted sea creatures are just as gross and disgusting dead as they are alive. HOWEVER . . . thanks to the wonders of the internet, I looked at the menu and saw that, even I, someone who is totally adverse to the denizens of the sea (this means you, too, seaweed snacks. EEeewwww!!), saw that I could easily find nourishment at this watery restaurant on Montrose Avenue. Friend and I visited on a weekday at almost exactly noontime. Friend, who is more weird than I care to admit, did NOT want to sit outside on that beautiful, sunny, pleasant day. (I need some new friends. . . ) I found her indoors. She told me she had recommended Glenn's because the eggs are so good. She ordered three eggs, and added blue cheese. I went with the 3 eggs with parmesan and green onion. Both come with a potato pancake, and your choice of bread. I chose raisin toast. I tasted her food in the process of inhaling mine. The eggs were delicious, and perfectly cooked. The potato pancake, I thought, was a nice touch; somebody in the kitchen must have gotten bored with the standard hash browns and searched out this acceptable substitute. The potato pancake had a creamy consistency; said friend told me that it was made with sour cream.  A young man (hey, you all are looking young to me these days) was our server, and he was efficient, prompt, and welcoming. He asked us both if we wanted butter on our bread; that was very good customer service.  I liked the atmosphere at Glenn's, too. I particularly admired some tapestries on the west wall, and asked about them. The server went to some trouble to get me information on them. All in all, I very much enjoyed my visit to Glenn's. I can think of nothing to criticize, except possibly my choice of dining companions. That woman really is a pill. (meaning - she's hard to swallow.) I sure wouldn't say that about anything at Glenn's.",0.9956,0.755,0.19,0.054,0.5630858585858586

Three times I had made advanced reservations, for a moderate-sized group (six people) and two out of three times a table wasn't ready for us, in fact, we had to wait more than a half hour for our table!  On one such occasion, when we had an advanced reservation, there was an open table reserved for a same sized group behind us, yet they didn't make any adjustments to sit us and give the group behind us the table.  We were forced to wait for a full hour,  while those who had reservations behind us got seated ahead of us!  Then another time my girlfriend and I went there, and the service was so poor, the waitress never checked if we needed more coffee or water, or to see if the food was OK. We only got one cup of coffee, no extra water and the order was incomplete!  We decided not to go back for a while.  When we did, they had Mrs. Butterworth's on the table.  I asked the waitress if Glenn's had Maple Syrup, even for an additional charge (which I gladly would have paid).  She pointed at the bottle and said ""'dat's all we got.""  Well, DAT'S DA LAST TIME I EVAH GO DEAH!

Decor aside, I was astounded by the sheer volume of daily specials. There are huge chalkboards on either side of the restaurants that literally fill the walls. The server was delightful, if not a bit scarce.   My party ordered the fried calamari. and I have to say nobody was a huge fan. They make a stylistic choice to make Calamari fries,cut in long strips the squid was too big for my taste personally. The crab cakes on the other hand were absolutely THE best I've ever had. The clam chowder was yet another home run, the best I've tasted. For my entree, I tried the lobster roll, it was good, not great. This might be yet another stylistic choice, I prefer the hot buttered lobster roll to Glenn's traditional mayo, celery roll.   Out of my party of 4 , two of us really liked Glenn's, 1 was fine with it and 1 didn't really like it.

It comes with one outstanding potato pancake and a toast of your choice. Everything was pretty amazing but I'll start with the potato pancake. This potato pancake is unlike any other I've had. They mix the potato with chives, sour cream, and possibly cream cheese (?). It might be some other really creamy cheese or just something I'm not thinking of. Either way, they are the best. They're crisp and flavorful and creamy on the inside. I want one right now. The omelet was effin huge (it is 4 eggs, afterall) and was chock full of our three choice fillings. I've gotta say that the spinach was really good. I don't know if it's organic or just cooked in something beforehand but every bite was better than the next. The whole thing was very good. We had an english muffin for our ""toast"", which came pre-buttered and got a side of ham as well. Everything was great and we left very full just sharing a plate. The coffee is good too! Our waiter was really friendly and talkative. The atmosphere is pretty laid back. The restaurant itself is not too big, not too small and they have outdoor seating as well. There are lots of things to look at on the walls and such and the sun shines bright through their big windows. All in all, a great place to eat.",0.9966,0.761,0.225,0.014,0.5162238713667285

The Thursday all you can eat shrimp is absolutely delicious. You have two options for the spices and can mix and match. BYOB makes it an especially enjoyable evening. Tuesday's all you can eat crab legs did not disappoint! The crab legs came out very fast, were always warm and our sever did not stare at us when we asked for our umpteenth leg! I think they recently changed their policy to no BYOB on Tuesdays. While I was disappointed at first, completely understandable. We ordered $5 dollar vodka drinks which were nice and strong.

Then, by the miracle of [insert idealogical figure], my allergies vanished!! My girlfriend and I took my mum here for a late Mother's Day dinner on, you guessed it, the all you can eat Alaskan King Crab night. I heard that Glenn's gets PACKED with reservations, and we didn't have one...BUT, they save the outdoor patio for walk-ins, and we lucked out! Didn't wait more than ten minutes. The wait staff greeted us, sat us, and informed us of the blackboard specials. Everything sounded delish, but we came on a mission: crab legs. My mom's a seasoned pro, but the gf and I are the rookie of rookies, so the wonderful staff gave us a quick tutorial on different techniques to approach these monstrous beasts. The one that worked? Napkin in each hand, crack the legs at the joints, use the knifing tool against the inside of the leg, and shake the meat out. You're started out with three legs, then they bring out one/two as you finish up, then they keep asking until you say ""uncle."" The legs are served with some delicious cole slaw and corn on the freaking cobb...smothered in butter and topped with parmesan cheese. Oh my goodness. This was quite a meal. The crab legs are priced at market value, so the cost may change week to week. I'm interested in the other weekly special [AYCE shrimp] and some of the other blackboard specials, so I'll definitely be back.

Tall young waitress/hostess replies that she can seat us at the bar in ten minutes or outside immediately (it is raining). I ask again ""how long for a table for two?""

I absolutely love the menu, as well as the boards with the fish specials. It was a tough choice, as there were so many delicious-sounding preparations, as well as many recommendations from friends we were with. We all ordered clam chowder, BF and I both ordered the halibut, friends ordered walleye (the one with the pretzel crust) and I forget what else.  The service was very good...pleasant and efficient. The beer menu is good and none of us ever had an empty glass. The soup came out, and although it was delicious, it was not really hot....bummer. It was barely warm. This is really the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars, everything else was absolutely perfect.  The halibut was nicely presented and came with an OMG GOOD horseradish/blue cheese sauce, also with asparagus and roasted potatoes. Friend's walleye was also very good. I wish I had room left for some Hoosier Mama pie, but alas, I did not. Man, I wish I lived closer to this place. I would be there all the time. I really look forward to going back again!

And Hoosier Mama pies. And Pepperidge Farm crackers by the basket on the table. In other words, fancie. Color me slightly surprised. At the table were seafood bisque fettuccini, seafood pot pie (mine) and New Orleans-style BBQ shrimp all of which were rather amazing. I was a little disconcerted when my pot pie felt nuked, but I knew better. We did finish with a Mama pie each: baked fruit, apple, pecan (the best of the three). So, the bill came to $120 for three and no booze. Surprisingly expensive. That and the flatness of the fettucini made for a somewhat lackluster dinner experience on the whole, though the experience was very tasty.

2011-05-15,5.0,"Yay! I am back. Yes, I know it has been a long time since I have written a review so I may be a bit rusty but let me tell you, Glenn's Diner is a great place to renew my yelping. So last night, I went out with some friends to celebrate the birthday's of John and Frances. Happy Birthday you two! For those of you that do not know John and Frances, feel free to post a happy birthday comment. Now back to the story. So, reservations were made for 6:30 on Saturday. A couple of things you need to know if you make a reservation. First, the reservation is only kept of 15 minutes before you lose it. Second, they will only seat you once your entire party arrives. Now you may be concerned, but if you are going to visit, your party is 4 or less, and you don't have a reservation don't worry. It never seemed people had to wait for very long to get seated. Even when we arrived the place was full but as people were being seated, others were getting up. This was a good thing since the restaurant does not have much room for waiting. They have filled it full with tables. There is a sidewalk patio, however it rained when we were there and so it was not being used. Well, really who wants to be eating outside in this winter weather, especially when it is raining? Definitely not me!  And seriously, when is summer actually going to show up for good? I am really tempted to use as many fossil fuels and fluorocarbons as possible to usher in global warming just to stay warm. As we arrived and were waiting for the rest of our party, we were greeted by many staff who offered to take drink orders. In addition to the traditional soft drinks, they have wine, a good selection of beer, and they make limited mixed drinks. I ordered a Bloody Mary. Usually, I do not order that drink because I have found few places that can make it as well as I do at home but last night, I was feeling a bit adventurous. I was not disappointed. It was simply good. The balance of mix to alcohol was near perfect. The glass was rimmed, just right, with celery salt. And to top it off, there were plenty of accouterments which included a spear of 5 peeled shrimp. Once we were seated we were promptly waited upon by our server. She was enthusiastic, fun, and managed our table well. She made sure that those that did not already have drinks got theirs. Then she took our appetizer orders. Once she put those in, she came back and took our dinner orders. When she returned again, (within moments of leaving our table to submit our dinner order) she had our salads in hand. As were were finishing the salads (I recommend the buttermilk Parmesan dressing) she was bringing out our appetizers. We ordered the Shrimp Cargo, which was very yummy. Think Escargot, but replace the snails with shrimp. We also ordered the calamari. Now, it needs to be said that we were not overly convinced of the calamari as we were deciding but our server described in such a way that we all felt compelled to try it. Let me tell you, as much as the shrimp cargo was good, this was fantastic! It is cut fresh, hand-battered, and pan fried. There were no rings or tentacles served. It was cut in strips and was so so tender. The sauce was a perfect tangy compliment. To be honest, if I was a glutton, I would have just ordered that appetizer over and over again for dinner until I could eat no more. In terms of size, the shrimp cargo is perfect for 5 people but the calamari could easily accommodate twice as many at a table. For dinner you have two choices. You can order from the menu which includes traditional breakfast and diner items or you can order off the chalk boards that cover the walls. The chalk board lists all the seafood options that Glenn's offers. Come in knowing that you are going to have difficulty choosing. Upon a first visit, there were 7 dishes that I struggled to choose as my first dish at Glenn's. I asked our server to help me decide. Her descriptions of each only made it harder to choose one over the other. My mouth was watering as she talked about each dish in detail. As I write this, I am tempted to just stop now and go back...but I will suffer on for you, the reader. I chose the New Orleans BBQ Shrimp entree. It was not typical BBQ but rather a nice blend of spices that coated each shrimp. It was served with a mound of rice and two crunchy pieces of toast. Though I am sure it was designed to specifically be a comfort food, but I can tell you that as I ate it the world was in a state of perfect harmony and I struggled to join the conversations floating around the table. All I wanted to do was spend those precious moments reveling in the tasty party that was occurring with each bite. Ahh, the joy! After dinner, our server came back to see if we wanted to partake in dessert. They offer Hoosier Mama Pie Company pies. However, we had desert waiting at home, so I will have to try again next time. All I can say is that this place was a true delight. Enjoy!",0.9995,0.766,0.194,0.04,0.5140582697725554

Instead, you get basket of individually wrapped 'pepperidge farm"" type crackers.  Gross.  He got the french onion soup.

In addition, my chowder was nothing but a mush of tasteless slop with a few chunks of what tasted like canned clams.  Campbells with a little salt is better.  The service was just as lukewarm.  In fact, we were victims of a change of shift.  Two more things really bugged me.  They do not have the type of utensils to really crack crab legs so that you can break them in the middle and pull the crab meat.  They only offered that little knife thingy.  Well my kids were raised to crack and pull.  Not cut down the shell and dig out little pieces of what was by the way, previously frozen not sweet crab meat ($40.00 an order).

Oh, and the service was indifferent; one of my tablemates asked for an omelet with four add-ins, only got three, and was still charged for four.  And two people at our table had breakfast pastry, but no syrup was brought.  When was the last time you had to ask for syrup with your pancakes?  Weird.

I tried 5 different fish items within our group and everyone had an oustandingly fresh and interestingly companioned and covered fish item. My trout was not correctly deboned, but the butter pecan glaze was great without being too sweet. The bathrooms are weirdly ambiguous which is which - a waitress then told me they were unisex. I wish they'd just been labeled as such. The waiter doesn't communicate where at the table the meals go to the server -- this area of service could be improved. At the end, it irritated us that they wouldn't do specific amounts on cards for a large group. There were 3 yelp elites at our table and this left us grumbling about customer service.

2011-04-17,5.0,"Warning: If you are going to Glenn's Diner, you should make a reservation.  It is a small miracle that I was able to dine here on a hopping Saturday night, but I was alone and the Gods were with me. I popped in here for dinner because I had twice seen it on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.  Being from the West Coast, I enjoy fresh fish.  The fresher the better.  However, many Californians have become lax in their preparation of the ocean's bounty.  A delicious fish deserves delicious accoutrements.  And, Glenn's Diner certainly delivers. So, after having flown thousands of miles and trekking to the North Side via train, I walk in.  The restaurant is PACKED!  And it is tiny!  Plus, it is 32 degrees outside, so there is no outdoor dining.  ""It will be an hour and a half,"" says the host.  I stand there.  He says, ""oh, you're going to wait?""  Yes, please, sir.  I have come too far for this. Lucky for me, the diners at the counter moved MUCH faster than anticipated.  My friendly host said ""Stephanie, step right up.""  Really?!?  It's only been 20 minutes or so - I was bewildered but grateful.  Hooray! I had already read the chalkboard, and I knew what I wanted.  The Pan Fried Catfish with Cornbread and Shrimp Stuffing and Spicy Hollandaise.  I skipped the wine - the pairing would have been a white, and it was so cold.  I ordered coffee and water. While waiting for my meal, I met one of Glenn's friends, who  was also seated at the counter.  What a sweetheart!  He knew that he loved the Ciopinno, he just did not know what it is called.  I was by myself, and I had a great time.  Everyone was so friendly.  Chatting about what this is their favorite neighborhood place.  Even the staff was awesome! Then, it came.  The spicy hollaindaise is a revelation.  The catfish was perfectly cooked - crispy exterior and moist interior.  I ordered an extra side of hollandaise (which does cost my friends, but pay $0.50).  The asparagus was sweet and still slightly crisp - perfectly cooked.  And, the entire combination - catfish, shrimp, cornbread and celery/onions with a bit of that sauce - was a REVELATION.  I think that the hollandaise is standard issue with siracha.  But, these people make amazing hollandaise.  Literally the best that I have had in the restaurant world (I generally skip hollandaise when I am out because it is OVERCOOKED - it's the trouble with knowing how to make it).  I wish I would have tried an app or a dessert, but I was solo.  Maybe next time.  This was an amazing meal.  One that I will not forget!",0.9991,0.729,0.247,0.024,0.5795739348370926

2011-04-11,1.0,"I just recently experienced Glenn's for the first time. I have always liked the way it looks and am a big fan of seafood, so I was excited to try it. I arrived at around 5:00 on a Wednesday to a nearly empty restaurant. (A single man was eating at one of the tables.) When I said I was waiting for my dinner partner to arrive (she was parking her car down the street), I was told I could wait at the bar, which struck me as sort of funny, given all the open tables. But ok, no big deal--just a little unfriendly. We were interested in learning more about a couple of the entrees, so we asked our waiter to tell us how they were prepared and learned that everything we had asked about was made with cream sauce, which we weren't in the mood to have. So I asked what he recommended that wasn't made with cream and he got angry and told me I was being presumptuous. I was so surprised by his odd response, but felt sorry for the guy, who, I assumed, must have been having a terrible day. When I asked if they might have fresh oysters since I'd seen Oysters Rockefeller on the menu, the guy had a mini-meltdownt and gave us a mini-lecture about the size of the kitchen not allowing for a raw bar. I had no idea, having never been there, of course, but by then we were thinking this guy must have just lost his dog or something and was unable to control himself. Unfortunately, that was only the start of an awful experience. The fish was dry as a bone--and I am not a picky eater, but my theory is that I can tolerate nasty people if the food is good. Not the case here. We ate what we could and then were finishing our wine when we were informed that we had to vacate the table. Another surprise. But we had ordered tea, too, so we asked if it wouldn't be too much trouble for us to finish our meal before leaving--and said this with as much good humor and laughter as possible. At that, our waiter all but lunged at us.  This was a freaky experience. I so wanted to like this place and have heard that some people do like it, but it was stunningly weird.

You soon find out that your not the only one to discover this modest gastronomic jewel on Montrose avenue. As the place fills up with dinner patrons the space gets tighter and tighter ...   With an original diner menu (breakfast all day) married to chalkboards  full of mouth-watering specials (mostly fish & seafood), Glenn's has an enormous selection.  Having pan-fried Halibut in a horseradish-blue cheese sauce and a cheeseburger at the same table is pretty unusual, especially when the halibut is perfectly cooked and served on a bed of asparagus.  Other dishes at our table was pretzel encrusted walleye (our only complaint: the crust overwhelmed the fish) and sturgeon in a creamy bacon sauce which also drew high praise.  For appetizers we had Glenns's Mussels, a giant mound of black mussels topped with four triangles of Texas toast garlic bread in a wine broth (delicious and perfectly cooked) and Clam Chowder which was loaded with clams, corn and veggies in a thick cream-bacon soup. Many deserts including ice cream with a bananas-foster topping and brownie pie. Prices are moderate and service is super helpful and friendly (Jules).  Ya, I know. There are no tablecloths and the tableware comes wrapped in a paper napkin but if you prefer taste and value over elaborate ambiance put Glenn's Diner on your must-go list.",0.9921,0.795,0.179,0.026,0.7153703703703703

They have so many kinds of fish and usually do prepare them uniquely.  I have enjoyed cat fish, scallops and a few other kinds of fish when coming here.  I think it's usually made with almost a southern or comfort food style which is always good for my family.  I don't think you should come here if you are on a diet.  The BYOB policy is a huge hit with my mom and I.  The portions are great, the price is very reasonable.  The ambiance is fun with the chalkboards and cereal boxes everywhere.  I have seen kids in here and enjoying the food. There are only a few tables so we usually try to have reservations. The tables are almost on top of each other and we've usually ended up talking to the other people dining due to that.  Usually, people coming here are just trying to unwind and get some good food.  I love that it's not pretentious in any way.

Second, if you order food for pick-up, staff act offended if you do not tip them for simply handing you the bag and taking your $$ (this has happened twice and it is annoying.)

2011-02-20,5.0,"Normally I do not go around dishing out 5-star reviews on a regular basis.  To me 5 stars is all about the best of the best, crem della crem, guilty pleasures or out-of-body-experience-good quality restaurants. And while Glenn's may not fall into any of the above mentioned categories in my book, they do just about everything really really well.  And I mean everything: breakfast, brunch, dinner, seafood, drink selection, atmosphere, and service.  It's like a hybrid diner that happens to serve the best seafood I have yet to have in Chicago. You may think that since this is a ""diner"", they would specialize in standard diner fare, but in actuality, their specialty is seafood.  They have at least 10 different fish selections to choose from: salmon, arctic char, trout, swordfish, mahi mahi...you name it - they got it, and it's all done very very well.  I have yet to have better seafood in Chicago.  And it's generally refreshing for me to eat high quality seafood in a casual environment.  And, if you're craving some meat, both their hanger steak and the ribs are delicious, so it's not all about the seafood, but again, I would say that's what they do best.  They also have a great beer and wine selection to boot as well. So just being a great seafood restaurant alone would typically not garner a 5-star rating, however, they also make very good breakfast too.  Their crab benedict is awesome, and if you just want some high-quality bacon & eggs, well, you're in luck, because they make the best breakfast around too.  I really like their hashbrown-cake potatoes they serve with most breakfast items, it's delicious.  Oh, and they put butter on my toast too, which is how toast should be served (nothing worse than having to butter your own toast, yeesh). So, when you combine the fact that they offer the best seafood that I've had in Chi with the best breakfast/brunch I've had in Chi, along with a great beer selection (they have my favorite beer - Anchor Steam) in a relaxed, casual atmosphere, you have a 5-star restaurant.  A great diner that specializes in seafood - cool concept.

I understand that when that little dining room is full, strollers need to be folded. But at 2pm on a Tuesday, I did not appreciate being badgered about it. She begrudgingly allowed us to sit in the corner where our stroller replaced a chair and took up no extra space whatsoever. Our waiter sat at our table with us several times and made awkward comments. Otherwise, he was alright. The food was decent. We split the lobster fettuccine alfredo and the crab cakes, and we got a grilled cheese for the baby. Nothing blew our minds save the bill.

I appreciated that each main course selection comes balanced with vegetables and that the menu not only offered seafood but many local lake fish options. For dessert we all shared a slice of Hoosier Mama pie.  The food was damn tasty. The appetizers came in generous portions and main plates were just the right size. Despite finishing everything I didn't feel stuffed. My only ""complaint"" is that the clam chowder is not what I expected. It tasted like bacon, barely clam, and was luke warm. It did, however, have a nice celery crunch. Don't get me wrong -- it didn't taste bad, it just wasn't what I'd call a clam chowder.

Difference between a cup and a bowl is $1, and huge, so go with the bowl and share with a friend. Or, eat it all. Or, take it home. Just get it. The Husband is a big fan of the potato pancakes, and they're super tasty and quite unique. Someday I will figure out how to make them, too, but for now, there's Glenn's. We haven't really tried much off the board, but all of their fish/seafood selections sound amazing - they really do seem to specialize in seafaring creatures made delicious. Their simple scrambled egg, chive and parmesan breakfast is pretty good, and their Reuben sandwich quite excellent.

My 100 star mother and I had breakfast here yesterday and were lucky to grab the last available two top. Unfortunately, it was located right near the door, so every time it opened, a blustery wind blew in. Next time I think I'd just wait for a different table. We started with fresh orange juice which was nice and pulpy; just the way I like it. For our breakfast entrees I ordered the parmesan and chive scrambled eggs with bacon, and substituted a short stack for the toast. Mom ordered the tomato and spinach benedict. Both came with a potato pancake. The food came out really quickly and looked fantastic. Mom asked the server for a side of sour cream for her potato pancake, but when he mentioned that the potato pancake had sour cream mixed in it already, she grew positively giddy. My eggs were scrambled perfectly, which is not an easy thing to accomplish, imho. The chives added a mild onion flavor and the parmesan provided a nice nutty and somewhat salty component. On the side was bacon, and 4 slices was certainly a generous amount. We both thought the potato pancake was rich, but it could have been crispier. The sour cream in the pancake rendered it a little soggy. I sampled mom's benedict and it was scrumptious and exactly what she wanted. The eggs, again, were cooked perfectly. I never make poached eggs at home because I always screw them up; Glenn's nailed them. My mom devoured all of her benedict. She never finishes all of her food as she eats like a bird, so that is truly a testament to how good it was. Service was extremely personable on all fronts: hostess, server, busser, owner.

I was hungry and didn't have a taste for seafood, but thought I'd check it out anyway. It was a nice surprise finding a nice cozy seafood restaurant in a neighborhood not too far from my own ""hood"". Glenn's is in the Ravenswood area. I was approached by a waitress who asked me if I had a reservation. This was at 4pm on Tuesday. Hmmm? Found out that it was ""all you can eat crab legs day"". OK, she explained how busy it can get. I looked up on the chalkboard menu visible from all sections of the restaurant. I noticed that they had a $14.95 ""Catch of the day"" dinner deal. I tried the pan fried catfish with a delicious spicey Hollandaise sauce (suggested by my waitress), which was very tastey and lightly coated. The other choice would've been pan fried trout. The meal came with a choice of soup, salad, roasted red potatoes, and a julienned veggie medley. I had the delicious spinach soup with feta cheese. Yummy! The beautiful leafy green salad was wonderful with the house homemade Ranch dressing. Loved it. My tiny complaint was the potatoes were just a tad bit tough/undercooked slightly, but otherwise, DELICIOUS! My suggestion to the wait staff: Suggest dessert to your customers and give your name when seating people. I had considered dessert, but it would've been nice and good business sense to ask if I wanted to try something else before getting the check. Customer service is key, especially at restaurants. By not offering dessert, you're potentially letting money walk out the door. Also, when giving someone soup to go, please put the container in a bag, without the customer having to ask for one. Nobody wants to carry a small container of soup around without a bag. Just a thought.

2010-09-18,2.0,"This place is not a diner. The food is pretty good, but it's a seafood bar and grill. Diners don't serve marlin or barramundi. And diners are kitschy not tacky, like this place covered in blackboards and cereal boxes. It feels like you're inside a pantry, but not in a good way. There's not a jovial atmosphere as conveyed by all the tacky signs. It's just a mediocre place with overpriced fish. I'm from Florida and paying $30 for a plate of grilled fish is just asinine to me. The service is well...awkward. I went with a group for a birthday party and the waiter stood at the far end of the table practically whispering the specials and when he passed by and I asked if he'd repeat them he said ""weren't you listening?"" For me, that's enough to drop the tip from 20% to 15%, but it was a friend's birthday so I just went with it. At the end of the meal he walked right up beside me and started listing their desserts. I smiled and said, ""thanks, but I'm good."" His response? ""I'm sure you're good. I'm just talkin' about some awesome desserts."" It's not exactly rude, but it didn't really make me want to order anything. The whole time I just wanted everyone to finish eating so we could leave and go to the pub down the street...where we had great drinks and a fun wait staff made our evening great. Also, all the tacky banners they put up during the mayoral election were kind of annoying. When I go out I want good food, not a sales pitch for Rahm Emmanuel.

2010-08-06,1.0,"Most frustrating place i've dined at in memory.  To start- i'm in the restaurant business, eat out 4-5 times a week, and moved to Uptown a few months ago.  Passed by Glenn's with my fiance and couldn't wait to try it.  Looked like a perfect place- breakfast, lunch, dinner- seafood- cereal boxes- cool decor.   First time there- food was ok- corned beef hash with undercooked potatoes- not crispy at all; chowder was good; potato pancakes almost cold/ or raw.  Anyway- server was one of those 'cooler than school' guys- the kind who high fives you when you order something he suggests- but he was fine. I figured i just got the wrong dish- still wanted to come back.  Back the same week- had breakfast- ate at bar- all was fine. But went back for dinner a week or so later and this is where i started to wonder who was running this place.   With a few people, one whom had his 6 yr old daughter with him.  She's an eater- we asked if there was small piece of salmon or some kind of plain fish that she could get.  Immediate, curt, uncompromising answer was 'No, we don't do that"".  Not even a BS 'let me check with the kitchen'.  Wow-  i don't know- if a 6 yr old in my restaurant wanted a piece of fish, my chef would've brought it out himself- that is cool!  Also- i asked for two items on the chalkboard and answer was ""No- we are out"" and ""No, we are out""  Evidently I am an idiot and didn't know the system on the board that lets you know what fish they have and don't have.  That was made clear to me. Next- fiance in for lunch with a friend and she ordered a salad and asked for the dressing to be tossed. Simple, right?  Evidently not- it came out on the side- no big deal, mistake, just send it back, right? no harm done.  Server takes it to chef, comes back- ""Chef says that this is the way it comes"".  Mmm, ok, can you make sure- we just want it tossed- shouldn't be a big deal.  Goes to kitchen, comes back- says :Chef says this is the way the dish is prepared""  Final answer evidently.   Now- my final visit.  Let's remember that I REALLY WANT TO EAT HERE!  With my 1-month old boy in a baby seat.  ""Cooler than school"" waiter says we can put seat in one of those highchairs-turned-upsidedown.  I asked for room for the stroller or a chair, as I am fond of my boy, would prefer not to put in a topheavy-loosely put together piece of cheap wood.  Maybe it's me.  So, manager comes over, like I was a troublemaker- says ""thats what we do for highchairs""  I said ""I would prefer to keep my kid alive, if that's ok? Don't tell me what to do with my child  (now, i will admit- I was ripe for an argument)  .  He said ""I'm the manager, what would you suggest I do?""  After a few inappropriate retorts floated in my head i told him to figure it out.  I am literally steaming mad,  I am a calm person but these guys will not deviate an inch from whatever screwed up standards they hold so dear.  well- Mr Manager did figure it out in about 10 seconds and we had an extra chair to seat the babyseat on.  Now, was that worth an argument?  Meal was fine- good server.   Bottom line- the place has a policy and culture of not wanting to take care of the customer.  You can't say I didn't give it a shot.  Or two shots.

2010-07-17,4.0,"The Yelp nation might think that I am the equivalent of a crotchety and picky old man. It has been eight months since I have given anything at least four stars, but Glenn's graciously breaks the cycle. Came here with a buddy of mine for a very late lunch (~3:30PM) on a Saturday before meeting friends in the DePaul area for a street fest. At this time you would expect the place to be practically empty at the weird lull part of the day in between lunch and dinner. But nope Glenn's was 75% capacity and overhearing the waitstaff, they were worried about clearing some more tables for 4:30 PM reservations. I have not even looked at their menu yet, but already I was thinking that this must be some sort of an exceptional diner to be eating at that has reservations in the first place, much less trendy enough to be taking such early Saturday dinner reservations. Regardless I hope the trend continues. I finally took a glance at the menu which is on the sidewall upon a huge chalkboard. After reading upon from previous yelp reviews and watching Guy Fieri, I needed to try at least one dish of the seafood list on that big black board, even though I wanted a caesar salad. But I truly could get a salad at Whole Foods, so I got the Marlin with jerk spices and a cup of their New England clam chowder. Ok, as radical as this sounds, I propose to the food nation that we officially drop the ""New England"" name from this soup and switch it to ""Glenn's"". After spending a weekend last fall in the New England states for some ridiculously bland chowder, I thought that the NorthEast forgot to even make it correctly. Glenn brings it back with such a tingly spicy cream base FILLED to the brim with whole clammy critters. We must consider the proposal for ""Glenn's Clam Chowder"".... After starting out with that tasty concoction out comes my jerk marlin. The glorious fish is liberally dosed not in jerk sauce, but fresh all spice, cinnamon, clove, and scotch bonnet pepper. Accompanying was this tasty rum pineapple sauce on the side which was really good, but looked a weird pink as if it was a cup of pepto bismol. The fish flesh had more than enough taste in it and this side dip was not needed for my palette. All seafood orders come with a small potato pancake filled with a subtle taste of chive and sour cream which danced on my taste buds. Bring more of those please... My buddy's bacon, mushroom, sherry cream Sturgeon sounded promising, but then again was a little bland when I tried it myself (loses 0.5 star). As I said before I have a picky tongue. Also for not being to capacity we only saw our waiter twice while we were there for 90 mins (another 0.5 star deduction) Regardless this East German judge must break his mold and give this Nouveau American Diner high praise (4 stars)",0.9761,0.871,0.083,0.046,0.49641117052881767

Yesterday my friends and I were having dinner when my friends purse was stolen. Although this is a rare occurrence at this type of establishment, it happened and the response and attention we received from the staff was impressive, they went above and beyond. First, several staff members ran down the street to find the potential culprits and also looked in garbage cans to see if the purse was thrown away, secondly, the manager called the employees of neighboring stores/bars to find out if they had seen the people who might have committed this crime, third and most importantly, they kept the restaurant open and stayed with us until we were able to figure things out. The manager stood outside with us while we waited for my friend to get a copy of her car keys and then when the manager had to leave, another staff member took her place and talked to us until we were ready to go (about an hour). Not until we were ready to leave, did the restaurant close. I'm soooo impressed with the service, that I will absolutely come back!  BTW, I had the Taiapia and it was delicious!

2010-07-05,5.0,"What's Glenn's Diner? One of Ravenswood's best restaurants, a friend once told me about Glenn's one night and said that they had some of the best fish around town. ""Fish? Why would you go to a diner to get fish,"" I wondered. Glenn's is not some greasy spoon diner, but one of Chicago's best restaurants. Glenn's might have been the first thing I ever bookmarked, so remarkable was the buzz and the menu selection. Is it a brunch spot? Is it a dinner joint? What about their all you can eat specials? Despite all this, no one I knew wanted to go to Glenn's! This Thursday me and two friend stopped into Glenn's and one friend rocked the Bloody Mary that was filled with a giant skewer of shrimp and celery salt. I drank some Arcadia London Porter and my other friend rocked more beer as we sat under the sun. For those who hide in the shade, the outdoor front patio has giant umbrellas to protect you from the UV rays. The server was very friendly and seemed to enjoy his work. One order of diner salad went in, followed by an order of calamari, Scottish salmon, and a shrimp po boy to top it all off. We enjoyed the nice day out and had a pitcher of water with our beer and Glenn's didn't disappoint me yet. The calamari came out and was very tasty with a slight hint of fresh seafood taste. It was fried and tasted good with a big hunk of lemon, but a little bit of aioli would have also have done the trick. We munched on the calamari and then our food came flying down. I bit into my shrimp po boy and was a happy man. The potato pancake that came with the sandwich was overwhelming in its richness, but was delightful in spite of it. The salad looked tasty with its giant croutons and my friend gave me a good chunk of Scottish salmon for good measure. The salmon was medium and tender and was the best salmon I've had this side of Calumet Fisheries. It was good it was delicious and it's how people should spend a workless weekday afternoon. Stop by Glenn's for some seafood, some drinks, some brunch, or even some all you can eat dinner. I think Glenn's is amazingly versatile for such a tiny spot. One more tip - if loud noise bothers you during your conversation you might want to sit inside as the train tracks can deafen out conversations in staccatto bursts.",0.9977,0.727,0.209,0.063,0.6152402402402404

I was disappointed that I didn't have the 8 stomachs of a cow because EVERYTING on the menu looked great.  Can't wait to go back again for more.",0.991,0.696,0.226,0.078,0.6537878787878788
2010-07-02,4.0,"Glenn's Diner is a small restaurant in my neighborhood that serves some of the best seafood I've ever had. You'd never guess that by the name. Most unknowing folks figure it's going to be patty melts and BLT's. But this place has great, high quality food, even if your not a seafood lover, they have many other menu choices as well.  We love going to Glenn's and used to go at least once a week. Now, we only go about once or twice a month. In fact the only reason I didn't give Glenn's five stars is that they've gotten so busy (which is good, I'm glad people are supporting them) that I think their service is starting to suffer a little. 9 times out of 10 I'd say we get seated relatively quickly, and have a great server that offers good service. They are friendly and attentive. On rare occasions, we'll get a server that is friendly, but isn't very attentive because they are so busy that it becomes hard for them to handle and you can see and feel their frustration. However, the dinning room attendants are amazing! They seem to anticipate your every need. They've even brought us refills when our server was too busy.  Recently we made reservations for one of their specialty nights. I was unable to go at the last minute, but heard from those that did go that even though they had reservations they ended up having to wait 45 minutes for a table. Now, this would be understandable if every table in the house was full, but they had empty tables and were seating walk-ins at those. I read another review that had a similar experience. I feel that if you have a reservation you should have priority seating and walk-ins should have to wait the 45 minutes. I think they need to rethink the way they handle their reservations.  Overall though, this a great, no, awesome place and we'll definitely go back, again and again. By the way, the Manager is extremely friendly and accommodating. I saw that someone else had posted something negative about her and all I can say is perhaps she had a bad night that night because she's always been nothing but professional and friendly to us. In fact, most of the time she recognizes us when we come in. She may not know our names, but knows we've been there many times and always says, Its great to see you again"" or ""thanks for coming in again"". She was very accommodating to my friends that had to wait for their reserved table. In fact she did more than what was necessary to correct the situation but it was very much appreciated nonetheless!  Go to Glenn's, but know before you go, it's not exactly what you would consider diner food and is not diner prices. It's not overly expensive either. I'd say mid-range. Despite my comment above, I highly recommend making reservations, especially on their specialty nights otherwise you could find yourself waiting for quite a long time to get a seat.

It was my birthday, so my mom had her best clothes on.  The cook along with Glen came to apologize and even asked to pick up the dry cleaning bill from my mom. We thought this was great! My mother went ahead and took her clothes to the dry cleaners and the bill came out to $75.00 because it was a heavy leather coat, her Ralph Lauren shirt and pants had to get a special treatment in order to take the barbeque sauce out of the pants.  Well, we returned to Glens diner the following week and we personally gave Glen the dry cleaning bill that he agreed to pay for. He looked at it and was a little outraged when he saw the bill was $75.00 however he said he would send us a check in the mail.

My mother-in-law had the Arctic char.  I had never had it before.  It was very much like salmon in taste and consistency.  It was served with a spicy shrimp diablo sauce with shrimp.  She said this was delicious.

The cereal wall is really cute and we loved the blackboards which listed the fish specials on both walls.  I can't understand why another reviewer complained about that since the writing is dark and large and there is no problem reading it at all.  There were about 10 things I would have wanted on it!  And they give you a menu with their regular items anyway.  So enough about all of that and onto the important stuff - the food at Glenn's Diner.  It was GREAT!  And this is coming from an extremely hard to please and discriminating person.  The waiter at brunch recommended a very random dish to my husband which I thought he would never order - the smoked trout hash with over easy eggs  - and I have to say that all I kept doing was reaching across the table to take forks full of it from his dish!  YUM!  I ordered an omelet which happened to be great too but his was really something special.  After we saw people all around us eating biscuits with sausage gravy, my husband mentioned to the server that he wished he had room to order some to taste because we never ate that before.  The server came out a few minutes later with a small portion that he gave us as a sample!  We couldn't believe how nice that was and how good it tasted too.   Our meal was so good that we returned for lunch the day we were heading back to NY (yesterday) and my lunch was even better than my breakfast was a few days earlier!  Another waiter suggested the seafood salad with spinach and  I have no idea how they can charge $10.95 for a salad with as much seafood in it as there was spinach!  It had a really delicious dressing and there must have been at least 10 shrimp in it along with loads of the same smoked trout and even chunks of lobster.  For $10.95!  In New York, the same salad would easily have been $25 - and even that would have been worth it!

Every once in a while you need a place to take a lady on a date to impress her, to charm her, and, ultimately, to get laid.  Such a place cannot seem like a place you take women to get laid.  It must be casual. It must be unpretentious. It must be disarming.  With Glenn's Diner... I win.  Like, every time. I discovered this place with a girlfriend a couple years ago.  I only remember boxes of cereal on the wall and that the Smoked Mac and Cheese got me laid.  After several visits, with dates and casual acquaintances, (who didn't stay that way for long,) I started to ABSOLUTELY love this place. Now about those cereal boxes.  Ladies seem to love that stuff. (Cuteness factor?

The crowd itself is mixed and the energy is pretty high.  The dude one could only consider to be ""Glenn"" walks around asking people if everything is good.  I kinda like messing with him with a, ""yeah... are you alright?"" because he never introduces himself.  It's like a considerate man just walked in to check on the world.  There are a number of ethnic people dining when I eat there, which I must say, puts me at ease a bit... But only a bit...

This was because their weekday menu lacks most of the GREAT things they have to offer. Can't even get some good ol' biscuits and gravy on a thursday morning! c'mon! Well, this weekend things were different. I walked up the Glen's diner Sunday morning with the eye of the tiger. Victims this trip were the corned beef hash and eggs, and blue star crab cake benedict.  Corned beef comes out, and I'm like ""what the, where's the eggs"". They were hidden under REAL corn beef AND real diced potatoes. It was very good. Nothing mind blowing, but  the use of real fresh ingredients is ALWAYS a plus. I have actually never seen real chunks of corned beef used. woohoo! Add some hot sauce and pepper to kick it up a notch. Crab cake benedict was very good as well. When it came out, it looked kind of small, but I was barely able to finish it. Crab was fresh and flavorful, but they could be a bit more generous with the  hollandaise.  I heard the mimosas are the booooomb, and they looked to be very good also. Key ingredient, triple sec. They come with your own personal bottle of bubbly too (very small, don't get excited). I opted to pass on the booze though. womp womp. Great place. lots to try, everything looked good. outdoor seating in a plus, maybe even a must.",0.9959,0.784,0.206,0.01,0.5642114695340502

Bananas apple foster pancakes?  Yes, please.  Stuffed with apples, topped with rum soaked bananas and some delicious cream cheese drizzle?  Holy high heaven, I had to counteract my sugar rush with cup after cup of black coffee.   It was, in a word, sublime.   And some spicy New Oreans scramble with rice, shrimp, andouille, egg and peppers for him.  Two thumbs up.  Plus it had this little rice cake that was conveniently located on the edge of the plate nearest me so as to provide the perfect angle for swipes from my fork.  Yum.

I ordered french toast for breakfast which I generally love, however there was this unpleasant and unidentifiable flavor lurking in the background. I was excited by the description and the creme anglaise but was disappointed with the taste of the dish.  Then for dinner my friend and I ordered the halibut and the mahi mahi. The halibut was cooked well and the blue cheese sauce with horseradish was a nice accompaniment. However, the mahi mahi wasn't cooked long enough, it had retained water and I am assuming it may have not been defrosted long enough.

I went for dinner.  It's pretty overpriced for what you get.  I didn't perceive value in the preparation.  I wasn't wowed by any of the food; maybe I ordered ""the wrong things."" Long Review... I really enjoyed the cup of New England clam chowder which set expectations for the rest of the meal.   My entrée was the cioppino.  If you've had cioppino in California and liked it; that is not what you will get here.  It was essentially a clear citrusy broth with chunks of fish and shrimp; not a seafood stew.  The typical tomatoes, bivalves, and starch component were missing.  I know everything is open to interpretation, but this didn't seem like it took much to put together.  (I think it's hard to find authentic cioppino/bouillabaisse outside the regions they were created; I should have known better). My dining partner had the fried yellow perch served with a potato and asparagus.  The fish were tiny and there were few of them (not too surprising).  You can get an identical dish elsewhere; probably for less. We both had desert.  Both were something you could easily do at home. The food was okay; it was just expensive for what it was.  (The garlic bread served with the meal was obviously made from air/wonder bread).  If I went back I would probably try a more straightforward fish dish, but to reiterate others, they were out of a lot of stuff.  I probably won't be back though.  It's just that I know other restaurants where I can spend $50 and feel like I got more value.",-0.1198,0.88,0.057,0.063,0.4348240469208211

The sandwich is on a beautiful soft hoagy roll, open-face, topped with tarter sauce lettuce, tomato, onion and bacon. Yum! Some things to note: Started with the clam chowder, and although it was good, it was not authentic New England clam chowdah. A little too thick, but tasty nonetheless and chock full of clams, potatoes and other veggies. And the potato pancake left something to be desired. The sour cream they add to the batter was too rich for my liking.  Next time I would shoot for the piece of fresh fish, and maybe even the lunch special. Its a good deal with a lot food for $14.95!

I was ready to walk to a different spot on this charming stretch of Montrose, But this guy's charm triumphed. I couldn't see the chairs he was offering to us at the bar, and he suggested that was because his,"" Big, fat, Polish head was in the way."" Awesome. Couldn't say no to this guy, even though I prefer to sit at a table. The staff was incredibly friendly and sincere, and we were were asked a few times by different people if everything was ok. The scallop appetizer was simple, but amazing. 4 scallops sauteed perfectly, with a little cup of some mustard sauce with a kick to it. Delicious. I'm assuming their fish selection changes regularly. After much thought, I settled on the trout, with a butter sauce with pecans. Excellent. Served with some small red potatoes and zucchini, yellow squash, tomato, and onion all julienne sliced and perfectly cooked. The catfish with shrimp and cornbread stuffing and spicy hollandaise was also excellent. The hollandaise is potently spicy! Decent wine and beer selection, but limited liquor selection. They're also BYOB. I seem to recall this place was featured on The Food Network's Diners, Drive-In's and Dives awhile back.   Can't wait to get back to Glenn's. My intent was to go for Tuesday all you can eat crab legs, which I still hope to do. Not sure how busy they are on weekday evenings, but it's probably best to make reservations on weekends.",0.9982,0.745,0.235,0.021,0.5246756021756023

I got Hershey's chocolate chip pancakes and coffee.  I usually find that chocolate chip pancakes are too chocolaty, but these had just the right amount as to not overpower the pancakes.  The coffee was so-so, but I drank three cups anyhow.  I REALLY wanted to try the biscuits and gravy, but they're only served on the weekends.  The main breakfast menu is served all-day long though, which I find spectacular.",0.873,0.892,0.079,0.029,0.5508201058201059

We started off with mussels - my first time eating them - and now I'm a fan!  He had the scallops, and had no complaints, and I had spaghetti and meatballs...lots of meatballs, very little spaghetti and not enough, or maybe too much, very sweet marinara sauce.  I'd say the sauce was the only downside; too sweet and not tomatoey enough for a marinara. The wine list is great, short and sweet and not pretentious; I had the Zinfandel - not the fanciest wine, but it worked.

The side with my meal was 3 eggs; I told the waiter I didn't eat eggs and he gladly let me substitute a potato pancake.  I assumed this would be at no-charge but I did notice our plates were a dollar higher for the substitution.  Meh, whatever.

My friend's picking this smallish cramped restaurant for a 12:00 brunch date on a Sunday Funday probably wasn't the best idea.  However, the food proved to be good and I'm sure I'll be back another time.  At a non-peak hour.  And not with a group over 4.  And not on their all-you-can-eat days.  Hmm...

I AM NOT KIDDING. It came with half a dozen shrimp....and it was only 8 bucks! I am allergic to shellfish (FYI: Our server told me that I can't order a bloody mary there, even without the shrimp skewer because their mix includes clam juice.) I opted for a mimosa, which was equally quenching, and included my own mini bottle of sparkling, a separate glass of oj (mixing my own was great...I like it heavy on the sparkling, light on the oj) and a sugar rimmed glass. My only thing about that was it was $9.50. Seemed a bit much, especially in comparision to my friends' bloodys which took more time to prep and again INCLUDED A SHRIMP SKEWER. Sorry, the shrimp skewer is totally blowing my mind. We each ordered a different entree, and no one could finish because there was so much food. I got the chive and parm scrambled eggs, which came with a potato pancake and a side of toast (raisin, FTW!) I also opted to add a side of bacon, which was cooked perfectly. Everything was delicious, my favorite being the potato pancake. It wasn't some bland pile of fried potato, it had a delicious herb and sour cream taste and  was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The whole meal was phenomenal and well priced. My friends got the steak  and eggs and the canadian scramble. We all enjoyed everything. Also a big plus: the staff was all super friendly and helpful.

The accompanying roasted potatoes and vegetable of day (julienned zucchini and squash) were simple and light.   My date had the scallops with the same sides.  I  tried one sans sauce--he requested his on the side too, it looked hollendaisey and unecessary to me--but he enjoyed it and smothered his fish as liberally as I did with mine .

Salad was a bowl of mixed greens - nothing fancy but agreeably a great traditional salad. The trout.  EXCELLENT quality!  Fresh, tender, moist, a FULL FISH.  yummmmmmmmm.  What surprised me were the sweetened pecans on top - I normally don't like my fish like this but it was a pleasant surprise.  I was just glad it wasn't all over the fish.

Glenn's Diner made me sad that I only have one stomach. It's a big one, but only one. And there were at least three things I wanted to try, without even opening the menu. And that's not counting the Bananas Foster French Toast, which is only available on weekends. Jambalaya? Sure! Lobster roll? Why not? Fried catfish with French onion soup? Sounds good to me! Somehow, I ended up with the Russian Rueben, which comes with Russian dressing and coleslaw in place of the Thousand Island and sauerkraut. An odd choice in a place famous for its fish, perhaps, but a hearty and satisfying sandwich. The only disappointment is that it came with only one of their sour cream laden potato pancakes. I need at least three of those to stop my heart. Our server was sweet as hell, and did a great job of talking us through our choices. My friend and I ate ""light"" -- she had the chicken salad melt -- in order to save room for the warm chocolate brownie pie with vanilla ice cream. It's exactly what it sounds like. Only maybe better. Glenn's is a funky little neighborhood spot that just happens to serve a surprisingly upscale menu.

Glenn's told him they would give away our table if we were more than 15 minutes late.  It was now 7:35, five minutes late already and still at least a 10 minute ride left on the el.  Then my boyfriend's phone rang.  It was Glenn's calling to make sure we were still coming to dinner.  The first generous guesture of the night to make me feel like Glenn's is a nop notch place. We arrived at the restaurant at 7:45 and a nice table for two was waiting for us.  The ambiance of the restaurant was friendly, homey and casual - exactly the kind of place I like.  The waiter immediately brought over a carafe full of ice for our 2 bottles and started our night off right.  We ordered the mussels for an appetizer, since I'm pretty sure one of my boyfriend's favorite things to eat is bread soaked in the mussel juice.  The mussels were great and there were more than enough for the two of us.  For the main course, we asked the waiter for his recommendations and he gave three: the sturgeon, the sea bass, and the halibut.  I ordered the sea bass and he ordered the sturgeon.  The sea bass was cooked perfectly and the sturgeon was in a really rich sweet tasting glaze, which I really enjoyed but my boyfriend could have done without.  For dessert we had the maple pecan pie which was really sweet and delicious, hats off to the local bakery who made it. When the check came I was pleasantly surprised that the corking fee was only $5 for the two bottles of two buck chuck we brought with us.  However, I noticed that my sea bass cost was higher on the bill than what was on the chalk board.  Honestly, most people would've let it go because if I tell you the price difference you would smack me for being the cheapest person alive, but after about a bottle of wine, I wanted justice.  I asked the waiter about the mix up in the nicest, most innocent manner possible and without a missing beat, he took the bill away, had it corrected and brought it back with his most sincerest apology. So, all in all, Glenn's has the food of a fine dining restaurant, the prices of an upper scale chain, and the atomosphere of your mom's kitchen - all three in one make a fine restaurant.  I'll definitely be back.",0.997,0.828,0.162,0.01,0.5779365079365079

The waiter pounced on our table right away and opened our wine for us.  We brought a couple bottles of white in anticipation of fish.  I was impressed they allow byob for a $5 corking fee considering they also serve a full bar. We ordered the mussel appetizer.  It came with Texas toast to sop up the white wine buttery bottom of the bowl goodness.  The mussels were covered in melted parmesan.  They tasted pretty good, but I noticed about ten of them were still sealed shut.  There were probably 35 in the bowl, but still not an awesome ratio.  I think the Paramount Room's mussels were better than these. For my entree I went with Sturgeon in a cream mushroom sherry sauce.  I was psyched for the sturgeon because I'd never had it and my little brother and dad had both caught six foot long monsters on a sturgeon fishing trip on the Snake River they didn't invite me to; motherfuckers.  My lady friend went with Sea Bass in a garlic butter sauce.  I definitely planned on some bites of that. The sturgeon came on a plate with asparagus and redskin potatoes.  The cream sherry sauce was a bit heavy, but so were all the sauce options on the blackboard menu.  The sturgeon wasn't as fluffy and perfect as ladyfriend's sea bass so that slightly bummed me out.   For dessert we split the maple pecan pie with a scoop of ice cream.  The pie company that made it did a great job, however it doesn't touch my Mom's sweet potato pecan pie with kahlua whipped cream. I can't see giving pretty good more than three stars.  The main dish was $22.  It was east coast American old school seafood, pretty good but I like that Asian fusion shit that isn't going to nail me to my chair for the rest of the night.  I'll be back to test out a lobster roll for lunch.",0.9954,0.814,0.15,0.036,0.471483942414175

We are in the way here, and we would be happy to even order now, and not wait for our friends.""  He's reply was so rude, saying ""this is our policy, you have already been waiting for your friends for 10 minutes!"", his voice raised.   My husband actually walked out, because he was so upset that someone was speaking to us like that.  (also again I remind you the restaurant was SLOW at this point..the host was not under pressure) However, I am not one to give up easily.  So, I pressed on, asking how us sitting and ordering would be detrimental to the restaurant at all.  I also asked if it was his restaurant, because it that was my restaurant and I heard an employee speaking to my customers in that way I would take a hard look at the types of people I was employing.  Between my speaking with the host and my husband walking out, one of the waiters who I have seen their before, asked what was going on.  He said, he was sorry, we will get sat right away, but that the host was following policy.  I get policies like that, but sometimes common  sense needs to come into play.  Or common courtesy.  Also, if there really was no bending the policy, would it has been that difficult to say, ""I can't sit you at a table, but you can wait at the counter?""  This place is a joke.  Aside from the waiter who actually let common sense prevail, everyone in the place acts like an idiot.  I would think it would not take a genius to understand, you want to fill your restaurant, not have people walk out.  I have never been treated so rudely at a restaurant, especially one where breakfast averages at $14 per person.  Needless to say I will never go back and advise anyone who will listen to never go back!  Overrated and full of rude employees!",-0.5649,0.854,0.076,0.071,0.4634182355112589

2009-09-14,4.0,"What a great diner!  In truth, it's a diner plus fish house, and boy do they do it well - the specials are great, and the fun fresh fish boards are updated routinely.  They will make any fish with any prep; you just have to ask.  (I tend to get a seared tuna with whatever prep struck my whim.)  They have specials many nights: all you can eat king crab legs on Tuesdays, all you can eat baby back ribs on Wednesday, all you can eat ""u-peel-em"" shrimp on Thursday.  Tuesday through Saturday, 11a-6p, however, is the best: 1/2 lb of you choice of fish (there's 1 or 2 exceptions) and sides for $13.95.  You can save a ton of money with that offer.  They have a wall of breakfast cereals which is a really cute display - and also is an actual part of the menu for the breakfast crowd (served all day). I have enjoyed the soups when I have had them, which I tend to only if I win the daily quiz for ""name that movie"" (which makes it free).  Look for the little chalkboard by the kitchen entrance. The menus and store attitude are great; they're perpetually short a waiter or two, but we still tend to get decent service (of course, we go at off hours).  For those who care, they have wine and beer and some bar stuffs but are also BYOB - but you can't BYOB on the patio, only indoors. I can't speak to the quality of the general ""diner fare"" because I've never tried it.  Yes, it's pricier than a regular diner, but you go here for the fish and the fun, not the slung dime-a-dozen diner fare.  The owner really cares about making sure your order is right and the fish is properly done to your liking - or he'll make sure it gets done that way - unless it's physically impossible in his kitchen, in which case he'll tell you upfront. Parking is annoying, sometimes.  Public transit works well (if it's an option for you).  It's worth it to catch THIS fish.  Go see Glenn and find out what all the buzz is about.",0.9905,0.841,0.138,0.021,0.5056047894757572

Too many options, a lot of that fish must go bad and a greater probability that it isn't fresh. Don't tell me that they cheat and freeze their fish, how could they? If an item is popular, virtual gaurantee that it is fresh or they are out of it. The latter happens often.     Who in their right mind goes to a yuppified diner to get cereal?

Can you call yourself a diner with over 20 small square tables, massive chalk boards and maybe 6 stools? It feels more like being back in school than in a diner.

You can't be classy, a little more elegant in the Ravenswood neighborhood. Hmm, didn't Zephyr's do the same thing, but without any big expectations.  If you want to go to a real diner, go to Jerry's on Montrose and Western or a little further west, West River Cafe on Kedzie. Probably beneath most of those that frequent Glenn's. In the meantime, keep on fooling yourself that Glenn's is a diner and enjoy the food. True, some of the things are really good, most things are expected to be good or better considering the price.

Tuesday night's special we heard was all you can eat crab legs for 34 dollars.  I will be back on a Tuesday for sure. The service was just strange.  The waiter seemed overwhelmed.  I brought a 1999 bottle of wine and he broke the cork.  When i looked at the cork it was in good shape but he wasn't paying any attention and just assumed it was a young easy bottle to open.  We did end up asking them to remove some of the corkage fees because of the debacle for the fish being out and the cork being broken.   They did remove 2 corkage charges which was nice.,0.9601,0.814,0.126,0.06,0.4880196523053667

Irregardless, here goes: A friend and I made plans to eat at Glenn's Diner as we both had heard tales of fantastical fresh fish. Being a Yelper (therefore being in the know!), I made a reservation, and the manager I talked to was super friendly and accommodating, squeezing us in at a busy time.  So we arrived and were seated right away. Waters had already been poured and a cracker basket awaited us. The chalkboards were filled with delicious-sounding fresh fish options--I really couldn't decide between the  salmon and pretzelled walleye, so I asked our server which was better, and she said walleye, hands down. My friend chose the lake perch po' boy, and we eagerly awaited our meals while chatting and admiring the wall of cereal (25 kinds, so they say!) Also, we noticed the vast options the menu offered besides fish, which made me reconsider my choice--however, I was on a mission so I stuck to the fish. So, my pretzelled walleye came and it was HUGE! A nice, thick, long piece of walleye covered in crumbled pretzels over green beans and roasted potatoes--what else could anyone possibly want? Well--I was underwhelmed. I know, right?! So sad, so sad. It was good, it was tasty, it was fresh, it was NOT the buttery yet crunchy goodness I expected out of this piece of fish. Come to think of it, it was kind of bland. Booooo! My friend said her po' boy would have been better had it come with cheese and tomatoes--maybe just a personal preference, and I don't know what's standard for a po' boy, but as far as I could tell, hers was just okay, too.  Man! I've read good review after good review--maybe my expectations were too high? Maybe I was expecting fireworks in my mouth? I mean, if anyone can tell me how and where to experience that...(for all those dirty minds out there, out of the gutter!) but until then, I'll probably go back to Glenn's during a non-peak time and try some other menus on the item.

We had the diner fare, and we've seriously had better at other, cheaper, diners. Who the hell likes a spinach salad with NO warm bacon dressing either - even though the warm bacon dressing is touted as ""OH MY GOD."" Service (once you get it) is decent, but I do have to mention their liquor law nazi again. F*ck you for scolding us about having a beer back with our $9 bloody mary's. So many other restaurants in Chicago actually OFFER a beer back, but Glenn's liquor law Nazi would rather threaten to withhold your drink because ""you can't stack."" This place is a joke... seriously.  The fish meals that we've had have been mediocre at best. They're not mind blowingly awesome. If you want decent fish in the neighborhood, then stop by. I always wanted to try their Red Hot pancakes, but for the longest time, they've been out. The place just needs some serious work on several levels. I'm disappointed because this place has potential - they just fail to show it when we've been there... and we've been there SEVERAL times.

I wasn't aware you could make reservations (rookie mistake) and we had to wait about 45 minutes for a table (although we were told 20 minutes). It's a small space and they are trying to serve as many people as possible, so it's pretty cramped.  I went with a couple people and we each got something different, and all of it was delicious. I got the catfish with shrimp/cornbread stuffing (which I could have eaten as a meal all alone), hollandaise, and asparagus. The two people I came with got the crab legs (dear god, SO good) and apple jack encrusted tilapia (which was sweet and savory).  The guys that work here are really nice and laid back, but not super attentive. We had to ask for things like refills and they didn't come back to check on us until 30 minutes after our food was served.

Two of us got omelettes (mine with ham, peppers and tomatoes, hers with mushrooms and spinach) and they were good - fluffy and big and not even a little greasy, and they didn't skimp on fillings.  She had to ask for ketchup with hers, but our waiter was more than happy to oblige.  My boyfriend had the steak sandwich, which is apparently their best-selling, and it was fine - the horseradish mayo was a little strong for my taste, and the steak was cooked medium when he'd asked for it rare.  My other friend's French toast was disappointing because it sounded so good on the menu (cinnamon custard egg wash!  Crème anglaise!  Choose your own bread!) but ended up being on about the same level as my boyfriend's sandwich - no major complaints, but would order something else next time. The brunch standout is clearly the potato pancakes.  The insides are sour creamy and oniony and gooey and the outside crust is thick and tastes like the grill, which sounds gross but is, in fact, delicious.

We just came here for brunch/lunch on Saturday. I had the Reuben and he had the Canadian scramble. My sandwich had more sauerkraut than corned beef. I also had cole slaw instead of their famous potato pancake. My slaw was very heavy with mayo that I couldn't eat it. I ate half of my Reuben because I didn't want to eat a vat of sauerkraut. Usually their scrambles are really good and well ""scrambled"" together. My husband's Canadian scramble was scrambled eggs with the other fixings just placed on the side of his eggs.

Check them out and don't be surprised or turned off by the 'diner' billing.  There is nothing dinerish about this place.   Make sure you get the potato pancakes as your side.  Delicious! Oh and even if you don't want any of their very good deserts, Margies is right across the street.  A perfect combo for a nice evening out.",0.9969,0.679,0.306,0.015,0.742015873015873
2009-04-25,4.0,"My brother LOVES crab and one day he forwarded me the link to Glenn's diner and asked if I wanted to check it out.  My first thought was, what? all you can eat crab legs at a diner?  Random but hey it sounds good.  Looking at Glenn's diner from the outside, you would never picture it to be the home of a restaurant whose menu consist mostly of seafood entrees- I mean it is called Glenn's diner after all, but you are not going to find any omelettes here!   I was pleasantly surprised with Glenn's Diner.  First and most importantly, their service is excellent and first class.  Glenn's diner is a fairly small venue and if you are here on Tuesdays for the all you can eat crab legs, you better make a reservation.  My brother and I did not know this so when we first arrived, they told my brother it was going to be at least a 20 minute wait.  So we totally fine with that, but they were very apologetic for our wait and even comped an appetizer for us.  The second time we came here, we came with a table of 5 and we made reservations, but since we still had to wait about 20 minutes for our table, the manager made sure to comp our drinks AND she made sure that our crab legs arrived right when we are seated.  The crab leg all you can eat deal is awesome, but I have to warn you in that the sodium content in these crab legs are very high.  The corn and the cob that comes with the meal is crisp, sweet, and buttery, it almost made me wish they had an all you can eat corn deal too.  Each time we were there, our waiter or waitress checked in with us frequently and always made sure that a new hot crab leg was brought to your plate right after you finished your old one!   I am already looking forward to the next all you can eat crab leg meal!  Their other entrees also looked yummy too!",0.9955,0.847,0.148,0.004,0.5252100203717851

We stopped by on a Monday night without reservations and were seated right away. I do have to agree with the other Yelpers - you'll probably want to make reservations before heading out.  I am not much of a seafood lover either but based on Yelpers recommendations, I went ahead and ordered a seafood dinner. Monday night's special was anything with a fin for $14.95 (or maybe $13.95? One of the two). I ordered the Mahi Mahi and my partner had the Tuna. Both were very fresh. The portions were generous. They were served with Asparagus and seasoned Red Potatoes. I found my Mahi Mahi to be a bit bland even with the Mango Salsa but I still enjoyed my meal. My partner had some sort of special Hollandaise with his tuna. It was spicy and he used it more for his vegetables than his tuna.  The mussels are definitely good. They are served with delicious thick garlic bread. Mmm! I'd go on a day where they offer a special. It is a bit pricey but the quality is excellent.  This is a pretty casual place and pretty small as well. Waitstaff is very attentive and friendly.

The last 2 times there I have gotten a blackboard fish with a spicy diablo sauce with shrimp - SO good but really spicy - you will need to fill up your water glass several times!

2009-03-08,4.0,"I have been meaning to come here for quite some time since I would walk past it several times walking home from the El.  It's a great location being right next to the Montrose Brown Line stop, across the street from Margies Candies & Ice Cream and in the quaint community of Ravenswood.  Here you've definitely come across where lots of the locals grab their fish 'n specials. Now for my experience to improve yours: If you're visiting on a weekend (even Sunday evening), I'd recommend you make a reservation.  If you don't, you may have to try and squeeze somewhere where you're not in the way until you have a table set.  I will admit that I loved the hostess who was very friendly and accommodating. They have a small bar that is decorated with a variety of cereal boxes (Lucky Charms, O's, Cheerios, Rice Krispies, and even PacMan).  I guess this is only for the weekends when they offer Breakfast.  You can get your choice of cereal (over 25 options) with a side of fruit and cold milk.  2nd and 3rd helpings are free.  Cute idea for sure!   Next to this ""Cereal Bar"" there's a small chalkboard with ""Name that Play or Movie.""  If you guess the answer, you get a free cup of soup.  All my friends know that I am horrible at trivia, but I happened to somehow pull the correct movie of 'Dogma' out of my arse.  I earned myself a delicious cup (well it was a coffee mug, I guess so you can spoon it or sip it) of Tomato Bisque for free! :)  My friends would also agree that I love anything free or that offers a coupon. Other than the ""Cereal Bar,"" another Glenn trademark would be the gigantic chalkboards listing the 16 fresh fish dishes of the day.  First off, it's awkward reading the board because anyone sitting near them think you're either staring freakishly at them or checking them out.  Weird!   Secondly, Glenn's boasts on having the most options of fresh fish in the city...which I believe only partially.  Out of the 16 chalk-written fish specials, 7 have a little fish magnet that says ""Sold Out"".   I had ignored all the unavailable options and decided on the Canadian Potato-crusted Walleye.  After ordering, the waiter returned 3 minutes later saying they were out of my fish.  At that same instant, a guy moved the magnet from the swordfish which was previously ""out"" to my walleye.  Swordfish anyone?  I'm guessing that they move the magnets around at their leisure so the cooks don't have to cook up and offer all 16 different types of fish at one time...Just a guesstimate.  This same thing happened to the table behind me with another type of fish.  A bit aggravating, especially when they coin the phrase of having the largest variety of fish in the city at one time. All in all, I ended up ordering the Mushroom-Bacon Wine Sturgeon.  I got my dish 'o fish which had a thick slice of Sturgeon, a side of asparagus, a yummy roasted potatoes and a slice of lemon to top it off.  I enjoyed the flavors until the middle of the fish was somewhat raw as if I had bitten into sushi.  A bit disappointing for a $22 item that wasn't my first choice!  You must order a side of POTATO PANCAKES if it doesn't come with your meal.  Creamy potato perfection! I loved that their fish truly tasted fresh (and a little too much that I thought it was going to squirm once or twice in my throat), yet it was a bit overpriced and remained completely random with their fish offerings. If you are going to hit this place up, I'd try out the scallops because I heard at least 4 people recommend it during my sit-down dinner.  In addition, their ""First Catch of the Day"" lunch and early dinner specials and the ""All You Can Eat"" (and I'd add "" 'N get messy"") nights featuring Alaskan Red Crab Legs (Tuesdays), Baby Back Ribs (Wednesdays) & U-Peel-Em Shrimp (Thursdays) seem like quite the Deal & Steal!!",0.9974,0.827,0.139,0.033,0.5031201277355123
2009-03-08,2.0,"After hours spent trying to piece together the last year of a recently deceased friend's life, her SO and I needed dinner, drinks, and a bit of relaxation.  Badly.  Really. Since life has been hellish lately, I wanted to take him someplace nice and Glenn's fit the bill perfectly, seemingly the perfect combo of casual/fine dining that I was aiming for and conveniently located near his home.  I'd been looking forward to trying this place for ages and both of us needed a bit of gustatory love. We'd chat, we'd mourn, we'd sustain ourselves to fight another day.  I was, to put it mildly, very much looking forward to this meal. Sadly, not so much the place for us tonight.  Perhaps it was because we came in at 8:45 (as we were blatantly informed upon being seated) and they close at a shockingly early 9:00 PM on Sunday?  Our bad, but the service - in a literally empty restaurant - not so much.  From the moment we came in the door, we were rushed, rushed, rushed.  Literally, moments after being seated and placing our initial drink orders, our waitress informed us that it was last call and we had to place cocktail orders IMMEDIATELY.  Okey dokey, Ms,Iwantstogohomepantsies, we'll do that...and we did. Courteously. Unlike her.  Maybe she had a bad day like we did.   Maybe...just maybe..she shouldn't be in the service industry.   Just a thought, pushy waitress - could we have been discussing DEATH AND FUNERAL LIKE PLANS ANY LOUDER IN A TOTALLY EMPTY RESTAURANT? I mean, really?  You had to be pushy?  Right after we are seated? Sensitivity, get some with the 24% tip I left you despite the obnoxious service, maybe. Chowder starters arrived, literally,  within seconds of us placing our order.  Ummmm...rushed, much? Good, but honestly, we got end of the day, bottom of the barrel thick leftovers.  No discernible seafood at $7.00 a coffee mug. They served our chowder in a coffee mug, sans oyster crackers and with NO noticeable dead creatures from the sea.  I had far, far, better chowder from La Gonodola the other day for a fraction of the price and it was loaded with clams and scallops, absolutely packed, and with far more flavor. Isn't Glenn's supposed to be a seafood place?  Very sorry outing for them on the chowder front, booo. Sorry, if you serve me a minuscule portion of chowder in a COFFEE mug, that soup had best rock my world, and this didn't.  Could have been cream of potato for all the flavor in it, no joke. Moments later, literally, we received our entrees, shrimp scampi and the King Crab Legs.  My companion had no particular complaints or compliments for his Scampi, but I had an issue with my crab legs that, due to our waitresses fervent desire to be anywhere but helping us, went unresolved as she did not check on us until she dropped off our bill.  I realize that Chicago is landlocked.  I also realize that, unless you live in Alaska, you are going to get reheated frozen King Crab in the continental U.S. I also acknowledge that my serving was HUGE. The thing I have a problem with is portions of the crab being, ummmm, STILL COLD. Yes. Cold. Crab. As in, they did not take the extra minute to properly BOIL THE FROZEN CRAB LEGS. Really? They wanted to go home THAT badly?  Apparently. I wish I was kidding or exaggerating about this, but I'm not - my crab legs were STILL FROZEN IN SPOTS!  Unacceptable.  This could have been remedied had our waitress checked on us, but she was apparently too busy trying to get home, so there you go. The coleslaw, although clearly homemade, was utterly lackluster, and the nibble I took from the corn on the cob was disappointing enough that I did not venture a second.  Again, I'd like to acknowledge that we were seated 15 minutes before closing time, but does that REALLY warrant this kind of service? Instead of being offered dessert or coffee (not kidding, no offer as I would have ordered both), they swept under our table 40 minutes after we had been seated and blinked the lights in a rather obvious manner to drive us out as we still worked on our entrees. Nice. Really.  I genuinely wish I was joking about this as I SO wanted to love this restaurant - they literally swept under our table as we ate our entrees. I've worked as a waitress and I understand the desire to get home after a long weekend shift, but this was really above and beyond bad/indifferent service combined with lackluster food. I cannot count the nights that I stayed long after my shift to take care of patrons that wanted to enjoy their experience - that's the job.  Our tab for two, 2 drinks each, 2 chowders and 2 entrees was a very reasonable $80 some dollars.  Add in tip, and you are in the $110 price range for two.  Not bad, not great. Just like a million other places in Chicago.  Unless someone else is treating, I'll be sure to try another option next time, especially if I'm trying to have a relaxing evening with an old friend after a traumatic life event.  Maybe next time, Glenn's, but probably not.",0.9615,0.776,0.121,0.102,0.5090013227513227

2009-01-16,4.0,"On more than one occasion in the past Ive been asked to go to Glenn's Diner. Being slightly snobby and having my own preconceived perceptions of diners I said no each time I was asked. Usually it was because I wasn't in the mood for greasy diner food. Now I feel like a silly elitist fool for saying no since I have eaten there.  According to Glenn's Diner's website they are trying to reinvent the American diner and bring to mind good,quality, delicious food when people think diner rather than what I thought ie, greasy, unhealthy, best-if-drunk fare. I do believe Glenn's has done a great job.  The menu is seafood heavy which is not typically dinerish. There are all sorts of specials every day of the week, but my favorite special is the all you can eat Alaskan Crab legs on Tuesday. Its such a deal that if you want to get a seat on Tuesday its best to go earlier rather than later. Other menu hits include: The Chicago style Barbecue Chicken.This dish is huge and the macaroni and cheese it's served with is smoky and amazing! Order this and you'll eat solidly for two days.  The crab cakes. They seem tiny but they are so dense and packed with crab. I'm starting to drool a little bit thinking about them again.  And lastly you absolutely cannot leave Glenn's without trying their clam chowder with bacon. You know what makes everything taste better? Bacon! This soup is full of win.

It was served with a potato pancake and steamed vegitables. I also ended up with a bowl of French Onion soup. The soup was delicious but my fish came out super fast. So i didnt quite finish the soup but it was really good and not super salty like most soups are. The fish came out and i started on it and determined it was slightly undercooked for my liking. I prefer at least medium and this was slightly medium rare. I sent it back and within 2 minutes it was back out perfectly done. Fish is a difficult thing to get perfect and it was. It really was perfectly done and super moist. if most fishes are overcooked they are way too dry. The sauce was really sweet but paired perfectly with Jerk spiced fish.

2008-12-17,4.0,"Does the diner actually need re-inventing?  The first line of Glenn's Diner's ""story"" on their web site states that the restaurant was born to re-envision this unique piece of Americana (my words, not theirs). And re-invent it does.  Though I don't know if I can fully get behind the word ""diner"" being slapped on this new formulation.   The only thing remotely diner about this restuarant are the breakfast choices served all day long.  If this were part of a chain, it would surely draw derision for being pre-fab and fake (and pricey and slightly touristy).   But I have to stop being cynical for a second and say that as a stand-alone, it's actually a pretty enjoyable experience. Once my menu sticker shock subsided (diner = cheap, greasy, and fast in my dictionary), I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich that was excellent.  But what really separated the dining experience was the potato pancake.  Now, I have potato pancake mix running through my blood (according to my doctor, I really need to change that) and the fact that Glenn's even offers this as a possible side was amazing.  But this pancake is beyond words good (it tasted like a loaded pancake but I can't find proof that it was anything but potato).  And the pickle that came with the sandwich was kosher dillicious. So in the end does it matter that it's not really a diner?  Not particularly.  It's just taking me a while to wrap my head around the idea of a not-diner.  As a former resident of the neighborhood, it's a great addition to the area; but after my visit before the Yelp Holiday Bash 2008, I will say the only real large-scale real Diner (Grill) around North Center still lives on Irving Park and not Montrose.",0.9461,0.885,0.085,0.03,0.5320864898989899

The char came with roasted potatoes (although I subbed in a potato pancake) and veggies (mostly green beans with a few carrots). All were covered with a ""shrimp diablo"" sauce. Overall 8/10. I was impressed with the fish, which was a good size and the sauce had a good flavor, although when I ordered it they said it'd be spicy and it really wasn't. Also, there could have been a bit more shrimp in the sauce. The catfish probably gets an 8.5 / 10. It was a quite tasty breaded fish and came with a delicious cornbread stuffing and some veggies. The only complaint I had was that much like the char the veggies weren't that intersting and the whole meal seemed to fall apart very quickly (stuffing was very hard to eat on a fork and the catfish filet was a bit small)  Appetizers: I had crab cakes, very good. Also snuck a bite of someone elses crab dip; I'd say it was above average but not great. Service: We had a big group the day after thanksgiving (11 people). Unlike some of the other reviews on here, they were quick and had our table ready ahead of time. Still, it's clear that they are more of a diner and they end up lagging a bit; for example, our appetizers came just as we were wondering when they would and our dinner came a bit after we would have liked. We had a nice accommodating waiter (forgot his name though) and they really tried to manage the group well (only flaws were forgetting a wine and beer order at various times throughout our group's meal)  Finally, although they have breakfast; I didn't have any. Someone in my group just had plain pancakes, and they didn't look to be too special. Lobster Benedict sounded good but not good enough to prefer for dinner. My friend and I claimed at the beginning of the meal that we might get some cereal for dessert, but were just too full. At $4.95 though per bowl, you pretty much could get your own on the way home if you really wanted it. Still, they do pretty much seem to give you the entire box, with 2nd and 3rd refills being free.",0.9948,0.833,0.142,0.024,0.5035012755102041

I had been meaning to try Glenn's for a while, lured by rumors of a great breakfast and fresh seafood of all things, but was ill-prepared for how packed this place would be apparently due to a recent feature on D3.  THE WAIT  The Ugg-clad hostess said it would only be about a 10 minute wait. Um...not so much. Try 30 minutes. At first the wait wasn't so bad as she bounced to and fro offering us free cups of coffee. But that good will immediately evaporated when groups that arrived AFTER ours began to get seated BEFORE us. I'm sorry, but I really don't care if it's going to be really hard to seat that group of 6...my group of 3 got there 15 minutes earlier and we should be seated first. End of discussion.  THE FOOD  Eh. Maybe they excel at seafood, but they don't excel at breakfast. My pancakes were overcooked and rubbery, my eggs were dripping with oil, and my corned beef hash was the dog food stuff you get out of a can and it wasn't even crisp.

Bowman's was packed and Lincoln Square had some sort of festival so we headed east on Montrose hoping to find something but having nothing specific in mind. We came upon Glenn's Diner. My only experience with Glenn's prior was that of two of my out-of-town guests had found Glenn's when left to their own devices and without my supervision and came back saying that ""best food in the world"" was a complete misnomer and that cereal boxes did not constitute a diner. Therefore, I was skeptical when bf said, ""let's try it!"" It was a beautiful summer evening, they have a patio and anything beyond Ravenswood was not tempting me so I said, ""sure."" We sat outside and when I glanced at the menu, I was at once confused and delighted by the incredible variety. Although it was crab leg special night ($35.00 all you can eat) I felt $35 was a little steep for the amount of crab I would be able to consume. Plus, I think crab legs take a special precision to cook I wasn't yet convinced Glenn's could master. So bf ordered the sword fish and I had the sea scallops. The scallops were incredible. Cooked to absolute, seared perfection, accompanied by roasted red potatoes and grilled asparagus. The bacon, mushroom, butter sauce was very tasty but totally unnecessary and almost too abundant. BF loved his fish so we were happy as clams with the food. The service on the other hand, left a little to be desired. I was confused by all of the blackboard specials, how they were different from the items on the menu and what the pricing difference was.

Many tempting options, but I settled on the 4 egg omelet with provolone and spinach. A few nice things, its 4 eggs! I'm usually pretty starving by morning, (Andy F can attest to my eating skills at breakfast), so it is nice to see something a little more than 3 eggs. Also, tending to be on the healthier side, you can go for all egg whites for a small up charge. Even better, you can get a side stack of pancakes instead of toast for another small up charge. By small up charge, I mean a little more than a buck which I think is fair. Jelena went with an egg sandwich, which I love, but didn't feel was going to be enough for me.  I have to say I was a little disappointed with the omelet, in terms of, it was a little too buttery for my liking. I tend to go for drier eggs, but it was still big, full and filling. It also came with a seasoned potato pancake, although not too crispy, it was really flavorful, I think with chives and Parmesan cheese. The pancakes were wonderful though, a hint of vanilla, not too dense but not too light, but just right. Jelena seemed to like her sandwich, scrambled eggs with some cheddar, but some thick sliced multigrain. Maybe it would have been filling enough... ahh I will stick by my choice.

That in itself is a good indication that you are not getting an authentic New Orleans' style po'boy. The slaw was too runny, and sweet, for my taste. The food was decent, but, as I said, overpriced.

Concur. 1/2 lb of fresh fish [I had trout but they also have tilapia, catfish and perch(?)], roasted potatoes (they subbed a potato pancake,) fresh vegetables (asparagus,) cup of New England clam chowder (delicious,) small salad with dressing (buttermilk parmesan was a little bland and the vegetable pieces were cut too large, but otherwise the salad was great.) All that was $12, how do they do it? By only offering it as a lunchtime traffic builder from 11 to 6, I guess. My lovely companion had the shrimp Po' Boy. It was also fantastic. I had a few bites. The shrimp were breaded and somewhat spicy. She's one of those people that believes in ""healthy living"" and ""longevity"" and and ""not keeling over from a heart attack at 55"" but really, honey, it was just fine without their succulent homemade tartar sauce. Service: At times I like a little sass and sarcasm with my meal. You won't find any of that here. So I'm not sure why it's a ""Diner."" Anyway our waitron was a friendly hipster dude with interesting but not overdone metal bits about his outfit. Maybe some of those were piercings. Wasn't really keeping score but he was friendly, helpful, communicated well and tablechecked 2x. I believe Monsieur Glenn popped over once to deliver our food, and he thanked us as we left. Nice guy. Again with the sincerity and lack of sarcasm, what's up with that. (Just joking obviously.) Decor The interior is a gallery of cute and quirky paintings that seem to have migrated over from nearby Lill Street Gallery. At least some are themed to the decor. I suppose some of these fill in for the snark deficit I mentioned in my discussion of the service. My seat allowed me to study the breakfast cereal astrology painting when I wasn't undressing my date with my eyes. I found the oldies music a little bit of a distraction. It's not a radio station but it plays all those old chestnuts you know all the words to and the volume was up a bit high for my taste. Misc. We ate indoors but there's a nice sidewalk cafe.

As in, it's definitely not standard crap-diner food.  I've had several of their sandwiches and all have been good, very good, and I've been unable to finish any one of them in their entirety. There is just too much sandwich. I really recommend the shrimp po-boy and the meatloaf sandwich if you're into that sort of thing. If you're not, they do have a wide selection, though it is definitely skewed to the seafood side of things.  You should definitely try the house potato pancakes. I like them smothered in vinegary hot sauce rather than ketchup, which I wouldn't have thought before I tried it. Their omelettes and egg dishes are also good, and they ""specialize"" in cold cereal, with a fairly large variety of favorites. It's not very cheap, but I suppose neither is the cereal itself. Everything else is very fairly priced, considering how much food you get.  Now that I think about it though, I'll likely eat here before it gets warm out, though I will definitely be sitting inside.

First, this isn't a diner.  Not really.  A diner isn't a cosy little nook with seating for less than 20 hungry folk, and emphasizes burgers, fries, milkshakes, and may even have a soda-jerk.  Glen's is nothing like those, and for that, you can thank the gods. Glen's is all about fresh, whole-grain bread, fresh-squeezed orange juice from some top secret source he'll never reveal, hashbrown pancakes, complementary imported crackers, and fish.  Fish adorns their specials menu, two chalkboards on their West and East walls detail several slightly more expensive lunch or dinner items such as pepper crusted tilapia, grilled tuna steaks, perch, and so on. It never seems the same twice, and there's definite variety here.  All of the other menu items are great, and there's no doubt each has a history of why it's on the menu, but Glen really wants you to order some fish.  Several signs say so, touting the health benefits, freshness, and quality of their ingredients in this regard.  The skeptic in me says he does this for profit margins, but judging by the afore mentioned orange juice and other subtle touches, I'm pretty sure that isn't the case.

He left last summer (2006) for a bigger restaurant and so my opinions may be a bit skewed since I haven't been back to eat in almost a year.  I was a big fan of the food while he worked there. The kitchen staff was hard working, most of them in or just out of culinary school. The wait staff was usually decent, but they knew me-so I got average service. The owner helped to open Nick's Fish market (in Evanston), left the business for awhile and came back when he opened Glen's. That is why the fish he has is so fresh-he knows his fish and seafood.  I highly recommend the applejack encrusted tilapia (usually on special). The burger there (with the ham and thousand island dressing on it) is extremely yummy and well worth it's weight in gold.  My only complaints? The place is very small and quite crowded on weekend mornings. It used to be a BYOB (now they sell liquor) and I think losing that lost a bit of it's character.

That's a stretch for sure since Ravenswood isn't exactly Paris or New York City, but you've got to give this place a try. I've been there once and it's really clean and cute inside, much like something you'd find in Wrigleyville or Lincoln Park. I ordered the Red Hots pancakes, which made me flash back to my childhood when I ate those little candies until my tongue ached. Did that really happen? I don't know, but I did smack my head on the iron railing of my bed once while roughhousing with my older brother. What does that have to do with flapjacks? Well, nothing, but the Red Hots pancakes were chewy, red and chock full of cinnamon domination, that's for damn sure. Yum! They also offered a Lemonheads version as a special, though I'm not sure if that's a regular occurrence or not. From what I recall, my dining buddy had an omelette and it was huge! Oh, if you have cereal in mind, you can eat as much as you want, choosing from the several boxes that adorn the wall behind the counter. I will definitely have to make a trip back for some Count Chocula.",0.986,0.779,0.186,0.035,0.41121841121841124
