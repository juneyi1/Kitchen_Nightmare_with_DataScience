2017-08-26,4.0,"I haven't been to this location in years.  But a pre-concert dinner before Lady Gaga last night at Wrigley Field with my sister was a perfect fit.   The good here never disappoints.  What I will say is I was thrilled that we had a table top for 2 at their outdoor patio as the place is very loud inside. For our appetizer we had the Burrata cheese served with heirloom tomatoes drizzled with balsamic vinegar glaze.  That was delish along with the complimentary bread they bring g to the table.  Tomatoes are so good when in season. For our entree I had the cavatelli with pesto, pine nuts, olive oil & added shrimp.  And my sister had the rigatoni with freshly made Italian sausage and a traditional red sauce.  A generous portion of food for sure.  The only thing disappointing was that I felt our experience was rushed as I specifically asked to not have the food come out immediately after our appetizer.  Needless to say that wasn't the case. Server was friendly, but felt a little pressured to order right away given a concert night.  Otherwise a solid place for a great Italian meal.",0.9564,0.826,0.145,0.029,0.5474465148378193
2017-08-13,2.0,"Very average.  The restaurant is located in a fun neighborhood near Wrigley Field and that is the best part.  The food was very average.  I had the salmon entree and my daughter had the ribeye.  The ribeye was pan-seared a little too much so the outside had an over-cooked taste to it and the meat wasn't seasoned very much.  My salmon was very strange.  It was completely white on the inside, which made me question the quality of the fish I received.  I have never had a piece of salmon like this before where none of it was salmon-colored!  The taste of the entire salmon dish was just meh.  I think the Francesca chain of restaurants hit their high-point about 15 years ago.  There is much better in Chi-town!",0.902,0.873,0.101,0.026,0.32285714285714284
2017-08-09,3.0,"We were guests at a rehearsal dinner on a Friday night. We were up in the second-floor separate dining area which you enter from a set of stairs to the left of the main entrance to the restaurant. They served us lots of different pizzas which were good but in that Neapolitan style which is so popular they were a little too doughy and not crispy enough for my liking. The dinner was sparse. We feel bad for the parents of the groom. The caprese salad for a table of six came out with three tomatoes and three slices of mozzarella. Everyone had to cut a piece in half. Next was the vegetable rigatoni. It came out on a super wide and long plate and basically had one layer of rigatoni and some dry sautéed vegetables. No sauce, no flavor.  Next came a delicious chicken limone with spinach. The spinach was perfectly cooked, not overly done as so many places do but not raw either. It had nice large slices of garlic and a good sauce of butter and lemon. The only problem was that here again it came out with four small chicken breasts (halves) already cut in half so pretty much everyone got only half of a small breast and had to fight for another piece if they wanted more. Best dish of the night was the profiteroles. Crispy choux puff pastry filled with ice cream and a delicious dark chocolate sauce. Not sure if the restaurant portions are like this or if it just happened because it was a party.",0.9928,0.729,0.199,0.072,0.5669911959385644

I always swore that if I ever made it back to Chicago - I'd make a point to visit here again... ...well guess who made it back to Chicago? Yep, you got it! I found this restaurant again, tucked away near ""Boys Town""... just a lovely venue. Wanting to re-live my first experience, we asked to be sat on the back patio, which they accommodated. Now, it seems to have changed since my first experience here - but nonetheless - it was wonderful. Their bread is wonderful. Carpaccio - OUT of this world. Dinner - the roasted chicken is one of the best in the country! Wine - (have you ever heard me complain about wine?)!!! Service - fantastic!

The food was average.  Shrimp were overcooked and under-seasoned, gnocchi was very soggy and fragile.  The house salad with hearts of palm and the carpaccio were the standouts for us.  Don't bother with the bread -- it was tough and very salty. The service was also average; nothing special there and had to wait a very long time for our check.  Compared to our other meals in Chicago -- Topolobampo, the Purple Pig, Chez Moi -- it just didn't measure up.   We will just keep looking for a great Italian restaurant.",0.291,0.876,0.059,0.064,0.509360119047619

We still enjoyed ourselves and it was perfect! The AC kept us nice and cool and we even opened up the doors to the patio to let guests spill out onto the patio as needed. They have VERY reasonably priced packages and spent under $1,700 for everything (including tip). I didn't find that Katherine, their event manager, was especially helpful or made me feel like she was all that attentive to my event, but she was fine. Overall, a great experience!

The service was a little spotty.  It took a while for our server to come to our table.  We never received bread (who does not love warm bread with olive oil) and had to ask a hostess who was walking by for it.  When our server did come, he was very distracted, did not look at us and seemed to be in a hurry.   Our food was good.  I ordered the tilapia.  I usually order salmon but my boyfriend chose tilapia for me since he said I needed to order something new.  I'm actually very glad that I did because it was delicious.  It had a really good sauce on it.  He ordered the Penne alla Palermitana and it was very good.  I also ordered a side of roasted veggies and they went perfectly with my fish.

The menu is just okay.  I was little disappointed a the pasta options.  There weren't a ton to choose from and most were in a tomato sauce of sorts.  I recognize that I am very much in the minority on this, but I don't like red sauce.  As such, my options were limited.  If you like pomodoro or marinara, you're probably all clear.  I ended up going with the rigatoni in a tomato cream sauce.  It was pretty good.  The sausage was flavorful.  But it wasn't something that stood out among the many other Italian places in the city.  I was also a little disappointed that it didn't come with a side salad or anything.  As others mentioned, the crusty bread was good.  But a salad would have helped.  I ended up ordering a caesar salad, and the lettuce was limp and yellowed.  It was edible, but not worth $7.

Service: 3 Stars! :(  The servers were all very nice, but the service was SO slow! We stood at the door and waited just to be acknowledged. It took TWO HOURS, from start to finish, to eat and pay. We asked for bread two times. It took a long time to get our drinks. It took a long time to get anything. I was ready to leave without dessert because it took about as long as our meal, maybe longer. I would give this place four stars if the service and wait times weren't so horrible. :(  Food: Some 2-3 and some 4-5 Stars.  The food ranged from really tasty to mediocre at best. I will add pictures of our dishes.  Don't Order: Calamari Fritti! Blah! Tasteless. Bland. Sub par. Avoid! Don't Order: Pizzas. They are just blah. Nothing worth writing home to mom about.  DO Order:  Burrata Pomodorini! A great appetizer! I actually didn't want to share mine. It's like an mouthgasm explosion of a mound of several cheeses. I went back the next day for more.  DO Order: Italian sausage and mushroom dish. It was my favorite!!!! OK to Order:  The chicken over spinach. It's adequately good, but not amazing. It's tasty.  Drinks: The Smashing Peaches was a tasty sweet adult beverage. ;) They also have a special on Saturdays for a $20 mimosa that was quite yummy.

We were seated in their ""annex"" which is an upstairs area directly adjacent to the main restaurant. I'm thinking that they are still learning how to manage that portion of the restaurant, but it was as if we were dining at a completely different restaurant. A few highlights from the evening: * The waiter had no idea if their Restaurant Week prixe fixe menu was still going on. Turns out it was, so he brought those menus by about 10 minutes after we were seated. * Mid appetizer, we hear a man at a table next to us exclaim ""YOU SERVED MY KID RAW CHICKEN."" Yikes! They left promptly after that. * The time in between courses was painfully slow. Luckily, my wife and I had no other plans that night and were happy to sit and drink our wine together. However, if we had other plans, it would've been a big problem. * After our main entrees, we waited about 25 minutes and the waiter finally brought us our check. Buuut we were hoping to order some dessert, so we asked for a piece of Tiramisu. * After dessert, we waited for the check for 30 minutes. During those 30 minutes, two separate runners tried to serve additional dessert plates that were supposed to go to a different table. * During the wait, we noticed every other table was waiting for something. It became comical because of how bad it was. * The ordeal lasted 3+ hours. We won't be returning to Mia Francesca for quite a while.",-0.9278,0.853,0.05,0.097,0.4626335470085469

Parking was easy for us, cause we have the #383 parking permit which is required in this neighborhood. However, Mia does offer valet service for reasonable $. This location is super narrow and doesn't accommodate many tables, so make a reservation.  We got to Mia before it became really crowded and our waiter was not as prompt as we would have liked. When you have to encourage the waiter to take your order, it's disappointing.  For a starter, we ordered the Bruschette con Coppa, which came to us over flowing with tomatoes. Very good.  We dine at Francesca's often cause we know the food is going to be consistently good Italian cuisine, this time it was just ""ok"". The kitchen staff seemed to be non-enthusiastic that night.

The sausage was so flavorful, and they were very generous with the portions. The bread was amazing; even after being delivered, it was still warm and crusty. The olive oil they provided with the bread even had bits of basil in it. I would have preferred if the vegetables were a little fresher. I understand that they had to travel a little farther than had I eaten it, but the asparagus and mixed veggies alike were both drenched in sauce. The asparagus had a creamy garlicky sauce (delicious, but heavy), and the mixed vegetables were swimming in oil.

2015-03-28,5.0,"""May I re-chill your cosmo?"" With these words, Mia Francesca on Clark has become my favorite restaurant. In my many years of ordering and consuming cosmos, in restaurants around the United States (and London and Montreal and on international waters and island ports of call), I have never experienced this level of outstanding customer service. In fact, this statement has reached a new, previously unknown level of favored phrase status. Prior to this, my favorite word combination was ""Dinner is served."" Today, a new combination of letters, spaces, and punctuation has become my new favorite, and it's very difficult to imagine anything overtaking it-- except perhaps ""Your private jet is waiting."" Terry approached our table, while my martini glass was still 3/4ths full, and somehow anticipated that my drink might no longer be at the ideal temperature. If you love martinis, you know what the ideal temperature is-- it's that condition where there is a thin layer, almost just a hint; of ice at the top of the drink-- allowing the contents to be beautifully, perfectly chilled. The glass itself, of course, also must be chilled-- frosted, actually. Unfortunately, this condition only lasts for a few moments. Perhaps ten, if you're lucky. It had been ten minutes. The frost had disappeared, there was no more layer of thin ice at the top of the drink. Terry identified this tragedy and corrected it immediately with his magic words. A few minutes later, my drink re-appeared, with the glass freshly frosted, and the temperature again perfect. May you re-chill my cosmo? Yes. Will I be back? Yes.

We live in the neighborhood and felt like italian last minute, so hopped on open table and Mia Francesca was wide-open for reservations.  When we walked in to check in, the place was packed, lively and bustling as we expected.  Assuming we would be seated at one of the few open tables, they quickly informed us we would be seated upstairs, where we had to go outside and through another door.  Turns out, the ""upstairs dining room"" is really their overflow dining room, which was a few small two tops surrounded by a long table seating a giant party in which the majority of people were under the age of 10.  As we sat there deciding on what wine/apps to order we had 3 or 4 kindergartners with sugar highs sprinting laps around our table and running back and forth along the banister that we were sitting against. The parents were oblivious and the staff didn't seem to care either.  The upstairs dining room was literally the kids table.     The food was good, but the atmosphere ruined it.  Not something I would have expected from an 8:30 reservation on a saturday night at Mia Francesca.  It was like being at TGI Friday's with Mia Francesca's food.  Maybe they should let you know when reserving that you'll be in the overflow room to avoid this issue!!",-0.6856,0.887,0.049,0.063,0.3275

2015-01-11,1.0,"I rarely write Yelp reviews as I feel I should only do so to add something valuable to anyone reading them. In this case (and I apologize for the ALL CAPS), I think this problem needs to be noted: THIS PLACE DOES NOT HONOR THEIR RESERVATIONS!! If you're like most people, you probably have the silly belief that making a reservation at a restaurant serves to ensure that you have a table at (or very near) the requested time. As someone who gets irked by even a five minute wait for a reserved table, the fact I waited nearly an hour for my table only speaks to the mendacity of both the hostesses and the manager who kept insisting that a table would free up ""in a manner of minutes"". This obvious lie was repeated so many times that I began to feel  as if I was being unreasonable by checking on my reservation - even though it was clear from the dining room that no one was leaving soon given no checks were visible on any table. It became rather clear that ""reservation"" to Mia's was simply a way to reserve your space in the ""wait queue"".   When we were finally seated after 9pm (for an 8:15pm) reservation, there was nary a word of apology from either the hostess or waiter. The manager eventually stopped by and apologized for the wait and offered a free appetizer to both my friend and I.  My friend did not want an appetizer and the manager obnoxiously pointed out that he would only comp an appetizer and nothing else, clearly stressing this was all that would be offered. Given we hadn't even asked for a comp, it was infuriating to have him set limitations on something that wasn't wanted or needed. What we really wanted was an hour of our lives back but it was obvious that the manager didn't seem to care about the fact he had wasted our time and screwed up our plans for the night. I quickly ordered a soup because I felt we should get *something* . Rather predictably, the $6 soup appeared to totally absolve the manager of having to care about the situation any further. He never checked in again -- and so was blissfully unaware that the lobster bisque soup that was eventually served was partially cold and didn't have any lobster! It was just a bowl of heavy cream with tomato sauce. Given how hungry we were at this point, we choked it down.  To add insult to injury, I then had to suit up to go outside and walk 4 blocks in sub-zero weather to add extra time to the meter since it had run out. I stupidly only put an hour in the meter thinking we couldn't possibly be staying for that much longer.   Our food did not come for another forty-five minutes. When it arrived, my hungry friend and I started shoving it in our mouths only to stop dead at the taste. The sauce of the salmon had a strange acidic flavor that made the dish taste weird and wrong.  Despite being ravenous, we both frustratingly switched back to the bread and tried to spot the waiter to send it back. He was nowhere to be found, so we were stuck eating bread. When he finally reappeared much later it was only to ask if we wanted to take the dish home, taking no note of the fact barely anything was eaten. When I emphatically stated No!, he simply whisked the dish away with no comment.  We declined dessert as we just wanted to leave at this point since the meter had run out and we had just spent our entire night waiting around to eat cold soup and bread. But once again, we were kept waiting for the check to get picked up. It was now going on 11pm. I'm usually a person that doesn't complain (as I find voting with my feet to be effective), but I was so angry at this point that I had actually decided to make a comment to the staff before I left about how horrible the whole experience had been - and how our plans for the night were ruined. Of course, I was denied even this small consolation as there was no one around to complain to. The hostesses had both disappeared and the manager was nowhere to be found. We left without fanfare after almost three hours of being treated with something akin to contempt and getting an expensive bill shoved under our noses at the end of it. The lack of even a Thank You from anyone in the restaurant as we left seemed to say it all about how they feel about their customers. While Mia's will probably always be busy - their location allows them to recycle through customers relatively easily - it's clear this is not due to good food or service. I will end my post the way I begin since this essentially encapsulates how they feel about their customers and it's rather useful information to anyone trying to plan their night: THEY DO NOT HONOR THEIR RESERVATIONS. And the food and service is just inexcusable on top of that.",-0.9962,0.813,0.063,0.123,0.5120508396595352
2015-01-10,1.0,"First off, this is coming from a former employee of Mia Francesca's.  SCOTT HARRIS IS A COMPLETE FRAUD AND LIAR.  This guy gets away with paying his busboys $2.50 an hour and makes his staff tip out in cash the difference to make up for the minimum wage he does not pay them.  Also, if you work for this company, be expected as a server to dole out 50% of YOUR tips to foodrunners, busboys, and the bartender.  It's a total SCAM, and I am highly shocked that the IRS has not got a hold of Scott Harris' nuts by now.  See, the devil is in the details.  Every night, as a server, you have to claim all of your credit card tips.  But, you tip everyone out in cash tips.  When your taxes come at the beginning of the year, you will owe a shit ton of money, close to double what you ACTUALLY earned.  My tax return said I made $40,000, I actually made about $28,000, all clear, and I owed the government.  This company is a complete disgrace, and highly illegal.",-0.9844,0.792,0.032,0.175,0.3820512820512821
2015-01-06,3.0,"My first visit to Mia Francesca was on New Year's Eve, 2014.  We sat next to a very loud table of 12.  It was nearly impossible to get our waiter's attention.  I checked my phone and he didn't come around to get our entree orders for 50 minutes.  Five-oh.  Fifty.  Minutes. Granted, the place was packed for New Year's, but that table told us they pre-booked a package.  We, too, had made reservations, so it's not like they didn't know they'd be busy.  You'd think a manager would swoop in when they saw us waving at the oblivious waiter.  It seemed like a total breakdown of operations. I'm trying to take that with a grain of salt.  Too often on Yelp, people blast a restaurant for circumstances out of its control.  Yes, they should have been more heavily staffed.  Or they could have apologized.  Or comped a glass of wine.  But they didn't.  And that put an unfortunate bad taste in my mouth. Now, to the food... * Prosciutto con Burrata - prosciutto di parma with creamy burrata cheese, basil-pine nut pesto, balsamic glaze and extra virgin olive oil.  I loved this.  The prosciutto was great.  I used it to roll up some burrata bites.  Most excellent. * Pollo Arrosto alla Romano ($17) - Roasted half chicken with garlic, shallots, rosemary, lemon and olive oil, served with roasted potatoes.  Quite good.  An enormous serving for $17.  The chicken sits in a pool of delicious gravy-type goodness.  I couldn't eat much of this because I went to town on the complimentary bread while waiting a minor eternity to get our entrees.

Several tables were seated at once and our server was slow to come to us after going to a table next to us twice. His utter incompetence continued to show through the rest of the meal.

The bread has always been warm and fresh and the food is always on point. A lot of their main menu items stick around - but there are quite a few entrees that switch their ways in and out with the seasons and popularity. There is always a specials menu that changes every night I believe. The cooking here is impeccable and I cannot stress enough that everything here is done really well.  I've never had a bad server experience either, which can be a rare feat for this near-Wrigley location. Everyone I have had has been helpful and excellent at suggestions, accommodations, and wine/drink pairings.  What sparked my review after all of this time was my reservation around 9pm (we arrived early) and had to leave by 9:30. Our waitress was attentive even though this place was packed (Saturday evening), and everything was brought out super fast, and we were done at 9:24.  I will say I am REALLY DISAPPOINTED that there is no more peanut butter chocolate tart dessert anymore. I guess they took it off a few months ago.

Like most Italian restaurants in the area- Mia Francesca is small, moderately lit, and has some traditional and creative offerings on the menu.  Yes you will be sitting nearby another diner, and you will probably hear some of their conversation, if that's not what you're in the mood for then hike on over to Olive Garden, because this is Chicago and space is limited. Olive oil has flakes of basil marinating inside, it pairs nicely with their warm bread and parmesan.  We shared the Bocconcini de Mozzarella which was delish!  The mozzarella was so fresh and the peppers added a nice taste, it was very light and clean.  I had their Valentine's Day special with seabass and vegetables, it was a perfect piece of fish and the vegetables were crunchy and perfectly sauced.  The seabass was lightly fried on the outside, so those bites were a bit oily which I didn't prefer.  My boyfriend had the filet with mushrooms and spinach, we had to send it back because it was a little undercooked, but once they got the temperature correct it was so good! Our server Meredith was so sweet, she checked in on us appropriately and made fantastic wine pairing recommendations.  She was honest with our inquiries about food taste and popularity, I am pleased she steered me in a good direction for my meal.

Way, way over sauced. Swimming in sauce.  Tables so incredibly cramped that if you aren't bumping the person behind / next to you, the staff most certainly is repeatedly every time they squeeze by a 6"" gap to pretend to service the poor folks against the wall.  Which brings me to the biggest gripe of the night: walked into a nearly empty restaurant at 530pm, and were given the table nearest the drafty door on a cold windy night. Before touching anything on our table I very pleasantly asked the host if we could please be seated elsewhere away from the cold air. I pointed out a number of tables away from the door. She claimed, ""oh, those are all saved for a party of 9"", and another, ""that's saved for another party"".  See picture I posted (and taken an hour later.... Still empty) By late in the meal, no big parties came in. But she seated a party of 3 in the table area I asked to sit at (party of 9) If you want to be a snooty, rotten hostess- fine. I'll go elsewhere. But don't outright LIE so frivolously to my face.  As such- I would never return to such a restaurant. Not for the salty food. Mediocre service, and especially this host.

2013-08-15,4.0,"I actually want to rant and rave about this place - went for my first time for Sunday brunch around noon with friends from out of town. We were asked if we wanted to sit outside, which I never say no to! The patio is great, it's closed off so it's cute and quiet. Inside of the restaurant, although I didn't spend much time in there, looked really nice, clean and organized. I ordered a bloody Mary (actually 2, but that's beside the point) and good lord, it was good! Perfect amount of spice, not too watery or vodka-y with lots of snacks in it, which I love. For my meal I got the eggs in a frame, which was toast with an egg on it that came with potatoes, bacon and sausage - all really delicious and just what I wanted. My friends all liked their food as well (none of us were able to finish, we were so full on bloody Mary snacks). Everything was reasonable price-wise; the drinks were five bucks a piece(!) and the average price for our meals was around 11 dollars; not bad for a relatively large portion. The staff was really great, a man who I believe was the owner or manager led us to our seats and checked back with us on how everything was once we finished. The only complaint I have is the constant filling of water. I appreciate it if my glass is almost empty, but filling it up every time I take a couple drinks is unnecessary. Other than that - fast, friendly service! I haven't been for dinner here, but I will definitely be back again for brunch.",0.9959,0.741,0.221,0.038,0.5539253539253539

Close as in my ass was in the other tables face as I tried to figure out a way to get back to the booth area. We had to pull the table out significantly because there was no way my legs were going to fit under the table with the way the table was set up. However, as we pulled the table out, so I could actually sit down, my boyfriend was right up at the table behind us. Besides that the table behind us was a group of men who were yelling obnoxiously and being extremely rude. After this rocky beginning, we went ahead and ordered the ham and melon and bruschetta to start with since we were starving. Both were great. I had the chicken salvia with tomato sauce mozzarella, ham and pasta, which was delicious. My boyfriend had a sausage pasta with goat cheese that was amazing from what I tried. we also split a great bottle of wine.

2013-06-28,4.0,"This is a great restaurant, one of our favorites. The service is quite good. They change the menu each week.  Why is it missing a star? They have become a little impersonal in service and inconsistent with the food since they went corporate. We have gotten to know the new managers since then. However, we have also gone in at times when most of the items on the menue are gone, and it's not even marathon season! The patch job for it doesn't  make up. They also don't have certain items that were developed through permitted chef creativity. The corporate piece has cut back on that. I've tried to recreate that celery and leek salad that the chef created right before the take over. How miserable that it has never returned! The waiters who would call us when a favorite item has returned are gone now as well. They didn't want the corporate homogenization to the service. They liked the input they could give on kitchen matters. It's sad.  We go less often, but I would still recommend it to others. It's not as reliably consistent as before, but until we get a new favorite Italian restaurant. It is our stand by. It is no longer THE go to for us though. We used to take every out of town guest here and eat at least once a week. Our daughter grew up in it. She was even ""saved"" by a bus boy as she pushed back from the table in a fit and started to fall backward to the floor in her chair. A regular bus boy was there in a flash and caught the chair just as it was about to hit the floor. She was in shock. We were relieved, and it was an awesome move! He is no longer there either. What a bummer! It does get crowded. They do pack you in. It can get smelly as well. To manage    Go during the week    If you must go on a busy night, usually they have the upstairs open, ask for a table there. You have more space, and you won't end up smelling like the kitchen.    If none of the above are possible, just plan the night in a way in which you can shower right after lest you smell like the kitchen or everyone else's fried food.",0.9735,0.833,0.11,0.056,0.4381040528099352

2013-04-22,5.0,"My friend has been raving about the food at Mia Francesca's for years... so I was elated to be traveling to Chicago and make a reservation with my girlfriends.  The staff was very friendly, attentive and prompt.  The menu had lots to offer without being overbearing. You can tell the put a lot into their menu and each dish is crafted with though and creativity.  We started with the Bruschetta alla Sorella- toast with avocado, radicchio, arugula, endive, tomato and fresh mozzarella. It was a fantastic choice. Beautiful, fresh and tasty. Lots of flavor packed into little bites. My dinner was the Pollo alla Fiorentina.  I suppose that it sounds rather simple- it was anything but. Juicy, succulent chicken perfectly breaded and sautéed. Light lemon sauce over the chicken and spinach made it to die for. I had leftovers from the hearty portion and sadly never finished them.  My friends had the Gnocchi alla Bavosa which was fantastic. Perfect, pillowy gnocchi with an appropriate sauce. The portion on this was fulfilling, but not quite as large as other plates. It also could have used a little more mozzarella. I also sampled the Linguine mare e Monti- with shrimp, mushrooms, asparagus with a nice garlicky, light tomato sauce. The linguine alone was a masterpiece. I'm always suprised at how many restaurants can't cook pasta right, but Mia's knows. The sauce was excellent. My only complaint is that we were seated in a back corner by the kitchen, bathrooms and server station. It was so noisy, we could hardly hold conversation. The servers were yelling to eachother over our tables, we had to duck several times to avoid being smashed by a plate of food and the kitchen was notably loud.

They support the Open Table reservation system, which works like a gem - on this note, when they make a reservation for you, they hold it for you. Absolutely no waiting. This is a HUGE +1 for them - they keep their word. Firstly, the place is well laid out. Their primary dining area is a little tight and loud (some may find this a negative), but that's all the fun of it. I actually enjoy being around so many people, laughing, and enjoying themselves. It has a great, well-lit vibe. If you're looking for moody and quiet, this isn't the place. The staff has always been so friendly and never stressed - which could play into poor service. Food comes relatively fast, as expected, water / wine is filled quickly, and they're always considerate of your experience. Overall the food is great. I don't think I've ever ordered something that I didn't like - I always take leftovers. The menu itself is limited - probably 6-10 items per section, but who needs extreme quantities of options? They have everything, your taste may want. FYI, the tiramisu is phenom. In the summer the also have a patio area in the back. This is my one gripe. I once took a date here who crashed onto her knees because she tripped and fell down the almost unnoticeable steps leading out to the patio. Gotta have that fixed or otherwise make them more apparent. They're so small and short that one wouldn't even call them stairs or steps. They also have a secondary, upstairs dining area, but it doesn't take away from the experience and doesn't feel like you'd be sitting in some ""economy class"" dining room, to put it in perspective.

My girlfriend and I had a reservation here on Valentines Day and it was not hard to acquire as I had requested a table through Open Table, the app for smartphones which is amazing. We arrived a little early so they sent us up to a different level where there was a full bar and more dining space. Full bar? It was not stocked with what was on their menu. I wanted a Two Brothers and the bartender spent almost 10 minutes searching for one until he finally told me they were out. Not the biggest deal in the world but the knowledge upfront would have been nice. Our waitress failed to mention her name as well as offer us anything more to drink. That was a bit of a decline in service. Also, the busboys are sloppy. When they are refilling water at your table and around your table, there is water spilling everywhere and it was extremely annoying. I don't know if it was because the tables were so close together or it's a common occurrence. Same with cleaning tables and adding cheese to dishes. They don't realize that their careless, face-paced methods are effecting other people around them. It's the smaller things that many don't pay attention to that can really dissatisfy a customer. Anyways, I'm done complaining. The food was extraordinary. The carpaccio was fantastic. My girlfriend and I get it every chance we get. As for the main courses, my girlfriend ordered a artichoke ravioli and I ordered the 4 cheese pizza (which was shaped like a heart, how cute). My girlfriend said that the ravioli was good, and that was all she really said so I'm assuming it was just okay. I should have tried it. As for the pizza, it was pretty good. I would recommend it to those who REALLY LIKE CHEESE. I can't stress that enough. The pizza is so rich. Mozzarella, goat, gouda, and blue cheese. I'm sure you can imagine what that tastes like. Yes, you need to pace yourself because that bad boy is RICH. But it is good.  So, 3 stars all around. Yes, the fact that the service was slower because of a holiday has been taken into consideration.

We continued to wait 15 minutes past our reservation time. She rudely gestured to me 4 different times to ask for my reservation name...again. She was acting like a straight-up bitch and I thought it was inappropriate. Even when we were leaving she charged past us as we were making our way through the tiny corridor to get out of the restaurant...without an apology of course. Pretty sure you should let the customer go first. Our waiter was kind of a flake too. Second, the food: It was decent, but I know they've done better in the past. I had a dish with linguine, scallops, shrimp, and what was advertised as a ""spicy tomato broth."" What broth and what spice? Both were severely lacking. The shrimp was overcooked. The redeeming part was the beautifully cooked scallops. My boyfriend had the artichoke ravioli which was delicious...but lukewarm at best.

We were seated upstairs and where we were the tables were a bit too crowded together; so much so that the servers had trouble navigating between the tables. We ordered a nice bottle of red, mussels in spicy tomato sauce, and the burrata to start. The mussels were good, but a bit cold and the sauce was not spicy. The bur rata was yummy. My fiance ordered the rigatoni with spicy italian sausage and mushrooms. His was good, especially the tomato sauce. I ordered the mushroom risotto and it was terrible. I normally love risotto, but this was like rice and uncooked mushrooms in broth. Very little flavor. My fiance referred to it as ""Uncle Ben's with mushrooms."" Highly disappointing.

The room itself is like a funeral parlor with tables jammed in there to get the most seating.

It was dark,stuffy, and most uncomfortably warm with the few unlucky people that were crammed in the space. Our waiter was ""sweating"" this cold January night.  Our dishes were overcooked and tasteless and presentation not impressive. I think if the host would have explained our upstairs option we would have declined and waited for the next inside main dining area table for a more enjoyable evening.

2012-12-30,3.0,"This is my first visit to this Francesca location.  I would normally not write a review of a chain's second location but this one is worth warning winter patrons about the upstairs. The food is as good as the location over on Taylor in little Italy. That site I have been to numerous times, and they say inside the menus are somewhat different between sites, but not that I could notice.  The food here was just as good.  Which is to say very good. The 3 star rating is earned by the design of the upstairs.  This is a small place so they have a second door leading to a nice looking bar and seating area upstairs, however they have no easy access to the kitchen so they have to use a rear upper deck which gives them some kind of dumbwaiter access for dishes and return items to the kitchen from an exterior rear porch.  The problem is the door was swung open at least 3 to 5 times per minute in the dinner rush, and it was 23 degrees outside.  There is no exterior protection in this deck area so the wind swept thru 20 feet of bar and right onto the dinner floor, people everywhere were wearing coats, everyone at the bar felt it, several complained including myself, and they said there is nothing they can do about it.  There is noothing blocking this whatso ever and its an automatic door, so it opens all the way, and hangs open for 5 to 10 seconds before it starts closing. Truly this will ruin the experience for you on cold winter nights.  If you can't get a table in the main floor area, as good as this place is for dinner I would avoid the upstairs at all costs.   The chicken and the Caprase were fresh, very well prepared and cooked, and I will go back, just not to this location.",0.8914,0.812,0.107,0.08,0.45552380952380955

First, we were asked if we wanted to sit upstairs.  That worked, but it was kind of weird.  Just seat us!  We had a reservation (made on Open Table -- bonus points for restaurants where you can make a reservation on Open Table!).  I had just made the 6:45 reservation earlier that day (around 4), so it was great.  Not that crowded when we came, but crowded when we left.  Surprisingly, we had no problem finding street parking either. When we were seated, my friend said that our waiter was the same waiter she'd had earlier that week.  He didn't even give her crap when she ordered the same dish she'd ordered 2 nights ago!  Must not have remembered.   We skipped the appetizer because they served fresh warm bread, always a bonus.  The only downside (though this would be a downside for lots of Italian spots) was they didn't have parmesan to put in the olive oil for bread dipping.  That's my fave. I ordered a primavera pasta, chocked full of fresh veggies and a light tomato cream sauce.  It was PERFECTION!  I have been attempting to eat healthy lately, so this helped me feel that way (though I probably wasn't that healthy... who knows).  It was such a big serving that I took home enough for another big meal of leftovers!  Too bad I don't like leftovers.   My friend ordered a rigatoni with braised pot roast, which was very good.

I was brought up on  it, and I'd have to say, it's probably my favorite type of food to eat, make, etc.  My boyfriend and I had been trying to find a good, solid Italian restaurant since we moved here and we had been talking about going to Mia Francesca FOREVER.  We always would have intentions on going and either ordered in or opted for something closer to home. We FINALLY made it this weekend.  Such a let down. We made reservations on OpenTable for Friday night at 830. We got there on time and the place was jam packed with people. We ended up having to wait about 20 minutes until we were seated, and ended up being seated in the ""coach house"". At first we thought it was actually better than being in the main dining room because it was much quieter, except that we were seated right in front of the door so everytime anyone came in or out it was freezing! As soon as we sat down we ordered a bottle of wine. We looked over the menu and opted for the stuffed pepper appetizer. The service was going well at this point, however about 10 minutes passed after the appetizer order was placed and still no wine. Then the appetizer came, we ate it. It was pretty good, a little too oily, but good nonetheless, but still no wine. We ordered our entrees....and still... no wine. Finally my boyfriend went to the bar and asked the waiter what the deal was with the wine, and he gave him some explanation about having to get the wine from the main restaurant. Really? 30 minutes to get a bottle of wine??? Anyway, the entrees came... I got the tilapia and my boyfriend got the rigatoni with sausage. My entree... Was okay.  The brown butter sauce and balsamic glaze combined had this strange taste, almost like breakfast syrup. It was kind of unappealing. The portion of fish was massive, with a few scattered artichoke heart pieces and tomatoes. I felt it was odd that there was no starch with it, but that wasn't a deal breaker.  My boyfriend's entree was about a pound of rigatoni swimming in about a half gallon of milk. It was the runniest cheese sauce I had ever seen and it had no taste to it whatsoever.

Without reservations. And without reservations. First of all, the ambiance. It's cramped. Really cramped. And loud. Oddly loud. And lit funny. It's very beautiful, though, but if they could turn the volume down on the conversation with some acoustic engineering it would've been a far better experience. Or stop service alcohol to loud people. Or just limit it to one table in the restaurant. Sorry. The food. Yes. The food was VERY good. Usually when I have Italian food, especially something like funghetto linguine with a cream sauce, I am expecting it to be heavy and almost pasty. Not the case here. It was so light and ... authentic. That's the only word i can think of, though it's not the right word. Light. Fresh. Flavorful. I love mushrooms and I could taste the mushrooms, that earthiness that I love about eating a raw 'shroom. That's what came out of the food. And that's what balanced this experience for me.

Ok, that's their policy, but when the husband asked for a chair for his wife, that was also refused. This was at 6:30 on a Wednesday, the place was easily half empty.

Growing up in an Italian kitchen it makes it difficult to eat Italian food outside my kitchen or family members' kitchens.  Despite this I always look for places I can go to and be catered to without having to cook it myself of help with the dishes. Mia Francesca is one of these places.  I was visiting friends in Chicago this weekend and happened to see the store front on our way back from buying beer for the weekend.  My sister's name is Francesca so it definitely caught my eye.  My friend told me the place is awesome an went on and on about it.  I then knew this was the place to eat on Saturday. Reservations were made Sat. morning. We got there and the place was packed.  The smells were familiar and I started getting excited.  As we waited for out table, I gazed at the menu which is nothing to rave about since it's nothing but a printout on recycled paper.  This is because their menu is made daily to reflect what they have fresh. I only found a few items that you will find on all Italian menus.  Everything else was unique to the ingredients they had at their disposal that were the freshest. I got the Veal along with two other friends.  The other dishes we got were the Chicken Parmesan and a pasta dish with portobello mushrooms as the main ingredient. However, for starters we for the Bruschetta which was the freshest I have had period. The place was packed but the service was awesome.   They could use a little more Air Conditioning but you can't really complain about it.

The bread and olive oil is just the first part of the carb-fest.  The real marathon comes with the pasta, because they give you SO much.  I had the Gnocchi in a cream sauce.  I would've eaten all of it if there were enough room in my stomach.  Gnocchi in a cream sauce were so good.  I've also had some arrabbiata sauced pasta which was really great.  There are antipasti, insalate and pizze that stay on the menu all the time, but everything is handwritten in because they change all the time.  I didn't even have room for dessert on my birthday because I ate so much pasta; I guess I should've just asked for a candle in my gnocchi.   The packed dining room doesn't bother me.  It almost feels appropriate like we're some huge Italian family eating crazy amounts of pasta and bruschette.  They just need to figure out their reservation deal.  Having to wait 30 minutes after our reservation time is ridiculous, and if you can't get a seat at the bar, there isn't much space to stand and wait.

The food is REALLY fantastic, the desserts are all good (especially the flourless cake and the peanut butter torte). I usually get a glass of wine or two. Dr. L Reisling was my favorite over the summer. They typically have good Italian blends for a cheap glass fee. Another highlight: the bread. Which we eat entire loaves of before the food comes.

I've tried their other dishes that other people I was with ordered and everything is delicious. The only thing that I ever find fault with is, occasionally, they use a bit too much sodium but that can be easily remedied by asking them to go lightly on the salt. Their appetizers I usually skip because their entrees and desserts are so good, I want to devour those and only those but if you have a big appetite, they're all really tasty too, especially their lentils and bruschetta.  Their desserts are to die for. Their Tiramisu is almost as good as the one I had in Italy and definitely the best and most authentic I've tasted here in Chicago. But all their desserts are really awesome too. I recently had some kind of cake with pumpkin pie baked into it (I think it's a seasonal thing though) and OMG let me tell you, hands down, best birthday cake I've ever had the privilege to try. I've tried a few other desserts here and have yet to be let down.  Service is always prompt and efficient without hovering. Atmosphere is loud and usually busy with the kitchen close by but it works for this kind of place.  One thing I can say, is the quality of food here is outstanding.

For main course I had a light broccoli rigatoni dish with a simple olive oil sauce that was a little heavy on the garlic. And trust me I loves me some garlic. Lets just say that if you are here on a first date, go for the red sauce.  Boyfriend had a goat cheese and tomato pasta dish that really didn't wow either of us. But could just have been our choices as we heard good things from the table about the butternut ravioli (seasonal), frutti di mare and chicken diavolo.   We did both note that the pasta was perfectly al dente.  For the birthday they brought out a simple dessert (chocolate sauce smothering something small) with a candle, which was nice.  Service was fine.  Overall a great spot for a larger family dinner.

I was able to book (way in advance) a table for 10 the night before the marathon to carboload and our table was ready within 15 minutes of everyone arriving. We were seated upstairs which is a tad less crowded and were served quite attentively by Erika. It was really busy and I can't say enough good things about the service she gave us. My mom, who is the only person in the world who hates garlic, ordered a chicken dish without asking about how much garlic was in there. When the dish arrived, she could hardly stand the smell and Erika was so wonderful about removing and bagging up the dish to take home (leftovers for me!). She brought my mom a bowl of pasta with a plain tomato sauce and made her very happy. She even took off the pasta from our bill. Then, another diner at our table was really unsatisfied with her pizza - it came out cold and she hated the way it tasted. Erika was, again, kind enough to remove that dish from our table and remove it from the bill. Instead, my friend ordered the mushroom polenta appetizer dish and it was THE HIT OF THE TABLE. One of the best dishes I've ever had.  I, personally, ordered a pasta dish with tomatoes, artichoke hearts and goat cheese. It was FABULOUS and I finished the entire thing.

My girlfriend and I ordered:  2 glasses of wine (each)  Some amazing bruschetta app to share  A chicken, mozzarella prosciutto tomato pasta entree (each)  And what was supposed to be 2 Tiramasu's (one each, but our waitress mistakenly only brought us one, so we shared...which was fine, but the point being is we ordered 2) which would've been great with coffee which she never offered to us like the other tables around us were!!! The wine was perfect---refreshing, light, and smooth.  Bruschetta was perfecto  There are no words for how over the moon we were about the entree  And the Tiramasu was hands down the best I've ever had--perfection!  With what we ordered, you would think our waitress would have paid attention to us, but no such luck. She started out OK, but then PROGRESSIVELY declined...granted all the tables were full, but she only had a few tables to watch and there were 7 bus boys (we counted!) that allowed finished dirty plates to sit in front of us for over 15 minutes, water glasses (that were finally fillled at the end of the meal) and wine glasses that remained empty and never topped off, and we basically had to flag our waitress down to get her attention when we wanted more drinks, dessert (which she messed up), and our check. We did get our food fairly quickly, but we ended up waiting more than we did eating the full meal.  She appeared to be more interested in 4 tops and tables with kids rather than 2 professional women dining over a 3 course meal...I was unimpressed with the service and it didn't help that we were crammed into a corner with no room to move and when bus boys were clearing plates and tables they were pretty much in your lap since there was no room to move.  Normally, I am an incredibly good tipper and it is RARE for me to leave a 10% tip. Unfortunately, our lady Mrs. Francesca got to feel what that is like this evening. I am one of those people who feel you earn your tip. You shouldn't just be given a tip because you work in food service and you deal with crappy people...why? Because I work in customer service and I deal with crappy people all the time. I am expected to earn my raise; therefore, you are expected to earn your tip. You start out with 22-20% and based on the service it remains or decreases.  It's surprising how much a great meal and restaurant can quickly go down in points based on a bad service experience.  If you want great food and could careless about service this is your place. I haven't decided if I'll be back.

I ordered the Chicken, which was two small chicken breasts and a side of spinach.  The chicken breasts looked like something you'd get in the frozen food section of the grocery.   They were cooked in a very uninteresting manner and just seemed to sit there on my plate, with no ""presentation"".  The spinach was fresh and tasty but at $16 for an uninspired chicken dish, I felt I overpaid. Others in my party ordered the Rigatoni with sausage and goat cheese and were complimentary.  I sampled it and thought it had decent flavor. The tab for our party of 4 was just over $100 (with drinks) which isn't bad by Chicago standards but, as I have stated in other reviews, it is the quality and the experience that are as important as the price and, at least on this night, the quality and experience fell flat for me.

Went with the prosciutto app plate and the special salad (beets, orange, red onion, pesto), which I split with the SO. The salad was pretty awesome, maybe a touch too much olive oil, but the roasted beets were done right and the mint/orange combo was a nice compliment. The prosciutto was good per my SO, I'm not the biggest fan generally, so I don't feel qualified to judge. I went for the mussels and pasta. There was a lot of mussels in my dish, which rocked. I like when restaurants don't skimp on seafood. I thought the spicy marinara was tasty (though ""spicy"" perhaps not). But the flavor balanced nicely with the mussels. SO got the sausage ravioli, also tasty, though he thought the pasta was a bit doughy. Both felt like our sauces weren't incorporated into the pasta as well as they could've been. Tasted like the sauce and pasta was cooked separately and then just mixed together last minute. I think that's the primary reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars. Received two complimentary desserts. The flourless chocolate lava cake and an apple turnover/bun/pastry (?), or sorts. I'm not a big dessert eater unless it's ice cream, so I was neither blown away nor underwhelmed. My SO more or less ate both. There was a nice taste of cinnamon to the apply one. And fresh fruit with the chocolate cake (which is mostly what I ate).  Our server, (I believe it was Tom), was fantastic. Friendly, but not the interrupting/annoying type. I still think this place crowds in way too many tables. Fortunately, we were next to a window, but I don't think I would go back during Friday dinner with all the noise. Unfortunately instead of making me feel trendy and cool, it makes me feel anti-social and grouchy. I would however order it for take out or go back during the week.

To me, I was a little skeptical because one person's idea of a great restaurant will always be different from another, and I also thought, ""Italian food is Italian food."" But hey, I was going into it more for the time with friends, not necessarily the food. I was not disappointed.  The service was fast, though not rushed, and friendly. We all were seated by about 6:45, and we were done eating and had our bill around 7:30, or shortly thereafter. And the restaurant was pretty busy the whole time we were there. The food was delicious and delivered hot. We all shared one order of each type of their bruschetta, and my entree was linguine tossed with prosciutto and a cream sauce. The portions were huge. One couple split their gnocchi and were full, and despite my boyfriend taking a few bites of my food toward the end, I still ended up taking the rest home. The dessert menu looked great, but I was so full I knew that having dessert would have been a poor choice, though I wouldn't mind visiting them again just for the sweets.  Four stars because of the excellent service and food. Only four stars because it seemed to be rather loud in the restaurant, which didn't quite match the decor. The decor lends itself toward something quieter, but with an open kitchen and tables close together, we occasionally had to raise our voices a bit to be heard, and the tables aren't even that large. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but just prepare yourself because you may initially walk in and think you're in for a quieter dinner, when really, depending on how busy they are, you may need to speak up a bit to be heard by your companions.

I on the other hand was looking forward to my vegetarian pasta that was disappointing. Although the pasta was cooked to perfect al dente, it was over- seasoned with salt. I had 1-2 bites and I was done. The worst part about this was how our waiter reacted. He came by when I had a bite to ask how everything was. In the middle of a bite I nodded politely. But by the end when he asked again ( after a bus boy had taken my dish away) I told him the truth and he got back to me saying ' but you said it was fine at the beginning.' wow, really?

The ravioli con spinaci was nicely done, though I would have substituted the four-cheese sauce for a butter and herb sauce. The wine selection was what you typically find at Italian restaurants in the city - nothing to rave about. Tables are spaced quite close to each other, which probably makes the noise level seem louder than it actually is. It also means that the servers can't always see if you're out of water or finished with the meal. They do what they can, but you might wait awhile if you need service.

Fortunately, I was directed towards the back (apparently there is another dining room there), where I sat at the bar, looked at the menu. It was at that moment, that I decided to order wine. I ordered the red wine - Sanguinity ""Nessun Dorma"". Up to that point, I thought it'll taste sweet, like grape juice. Nope.  Whoa. What can I say? When you are about 36 years and drinking wine for the first time in your entire life, its hard to find a frame of reference for the experience. I will say that at first, I wasn't really liking it.

With 265 reviews for this concept alone, they really need to engage with their customers a little more closely. Regardless, I love this place.  Me and a friend were visiting Chicago over New Year's and decided to do a late dinner here on New Year's Day. Engaging a little too hard in celebratory shenanigans the night prior, a laid back evening was much needed. I visited Mia Francesca back in July for the first time and loved it. The second time was even better! To start, my friend and I shared the Risotto appetizer special. It was delicious. Risotto is hard to perfect, but this was the closest to perfection I've tasted. Next, I ordered the Insalata alla Francesca. This salad is amazing! Romaine, endive and radicchio with fresh blue cheese crumbles and vegetables. It's definitely large enough to share and, if you're not all that hungry, a great option for a meal. But, I'm glad I opted for a pasta dish for my main entree.  I choose the Linguine al Funghello. It was tossed in a veal-brandy sauce with big plump mushrooms. It as absolutely delicious. Hands down, it was the best pasta dish I've ever had. We were too stuffed for dessert, but the tiramisu, I've heard, is delicious. Another plus for this place is I noticed it offers a Gluten-free menu, which many of my friends suffering from this allergy would greatly appreciate.  I would grade the service lower than food...maybe a B. The servers need to be a little more attentive. We waited over five minutes for a greeting and waters.  Other than that, this place is one of my favorite restaurants in the nation. The seating is typical Chicago-style dining...close and cramped, but possessing a sense of community and charm. It's the type of dining a true foodie appreciates because the chef and/or owners put their money where it matters...into the quality of the food and not dumping all kinds of money into the decorating and interior.

First off, the Open Table reservation was super helpful, I highly recommend it on any peak night since the restaurant is on the cozier side and there isn't a whole ton of space to wait. Except by the bar which obviously is no twist of the arm for me... My second time here and we sat upstairs which was also very nice, I kind of liked it better because it was more roomy. Our waitress was very sweet and made recommendations since we had some Mia Virgins at the table.  Ordered the house red pinot which was good about $45 a bottle. They are notorious for their mussels app but I couldn't resist an authentic caprese salad. They use buffalo mozzarella instead of regular cow's milk which I thought was pretty nifty.  I decided to take the road less traveled this time and order a pizza as my entree (yup, ALL for me, so selfish I know). This pizza had olives, prosciutto, artichoke, cheese, and a fried egg on top. OH BABY. When it comes out they do a fun little ""pizza dance"" if you will where they dice the egg up for you which my friend's boyfriend found mesmerizing. While very delicious it started to get soggy towards the end. I would still highly recommend trying it out, I had no idea they were infamous for pizza as well as pasta/seafood entrees.

From the hand-scrawled menus to the cozy little space that is intimate enough for a date and lively enough for friends, there is so much to love about Mia Francesca. My favourite is the Quattro Stagioni pizza: prosciutto, artichoke, mushroom and egg on a delicate thin crust. The waiter places the dish before you, breaks the yolk in the centre and swirls it evenly so it cooks on the hot surface. The result?

We called Mia Francesca, sure they would be booked, but they were so accommodating and fit us in at the exact time we wanted. Proving again that this place never disappoints! Every time we come here, we leave happy. I haven't come across a less than stellar thing on the menu, the staff is great, and the price is right! With four of us last night, we had two appetizers (calamari-some of the best I've ever had, and a pizza) and two salads (fresh crunchy peapod salad and the Francesca one), and then split two pastas. It was perfect and delicious.  Then came the torta lava. I am a chocolate fiend, and this is one of the best chocolate desserts. Ever. Melts in your mouth. We couldn't get over it, so we just shut up and devoured it. And-with all that food and two drinks, the total bill was a little over $100! For four people! And amazing food!

2010-12-18,4.0,"I rarely go out to have pasta because it's pretty damn easy to make at home. Plus, I find that a lot of places tend to keep their sauces on the really acidic side which is actually attributed to them  not cooking down the tomatoes long enough to actually develop the sweetness that is naturally found in them. BUT low and behold, Mia Francesca... you do me so well. Can I just say that I'm a sucker for restaurants that have consistently changing menus? I'm someone who likes to try new things often so this definitely caters to my needs. Their carpaccio was decadent.  I love the salty bite of the parmigiano reggiano and the briney capers. mmmm and the hearts of palm? yes please. Oh not to mention that you get a huge platter of carpaccio for a (very) modest $8 Let's just say my 5 year old brother LOVES carpaccio because of Mia Francesca...  Wow, I just hyped up Mia Francesca a whole lot over one dish but alas, there are some downfalls.. like their salad.. Insalata Francesca.. go away. You're over dressed, over cheesed, and the vegetables need a little perk. I'll forget you ever happened. But onto the Carbonara... soo rich. but oh so tasty. honestly you probably can't eat it too often.. it sticks to your ribs. but man I love a good carbonara and they do it just right. I have no qualms over this other than its adverse effects on your health. but you only live once right? I've also had their conchiglie with smoked mozz.  love smoked mozz, can't go wrong. So all in all.. pretty solid pastas (from what I've had so far) and my go to carpaccio spot for boystown.

2010-12-14,4.0,"It's hard to argue against the original Scott Harris invention that spawned the Francesca empire. The food is dependably great, the atmosphere lively and the prices right. I probably only make it to Mia once a year, but that's only because I'm a little different and need to try new places. More normal people that live so close to a culinary staple that is Mia Francesca likely go here once a month, and I envy them (especially in summer). This visit occurred over Thanksgiving weekend after going to the movies down the street. We had a lateish reservation but the place was still packed (and quite loud with the soundtrack). Our starter was a delicious pizza special. My memory and picture suggest it had garlic, arugula, garlic, shaved Parmesan, olive oil, truffle oil and other cheeses. It was the perfect way to start an Italian dinner and the perfect size to avoid ruining our appetite. The ingredients were fresh and it arrived quickly.    Erica and I shared a caesar salad to start, with standard tastiness but with the addition of grilled red peppers. Kind of a weird texture and flavor to throw into a classic salad. Erica was not a huge fan. I liked the salad, including the peppers, though it was different. Continuing with the sharing theme, we ordered a rigatoni with lots of vegetables in a light tomato sauce. Again, I liked the dish more than Erica. The vegetables were well seasoned, which made for a great combination with fresh pasta and tasty shaved cheese. It doesn't take much to please me with pasta but it still has to taste great - something Francesca does extremely well for the price ($12.99). At the end of the day, I agree with 460 people on Urbanspoon that Mia Francesca's is one of the best restaurants in Chicago (#19 on their list). I wouldn't say it's 4 Star dining, but it's not supposed to be. They do a great job of provided great Italian food in a fun, casual, neighborhood setting at affordable prices (and affordable wine list too). Our service was solid, and the only critique was that they like to play dance/pop music throughout the restaurant at high levels (contrary to typical romantic Italian spots).

We had two bottles of wine - both recommended by our server and they were reasonably priced (for restaurant wine...) and complimented our meals well. We had the mussels in a red broth for an appetizer - which was good. I'm so used to always having mussels in a wine or garlic sauce that this was a nice change. We shared a capresi salad and prosciutto which were also done well - the capresi having blue cheese instead of the typical mozzarella.  Everyone enjoyed their dinners, one sausage and mushroom pizza, chicken with mushroom and prosciutto, and two of the pasta dishes. All were cooked well and very flavorful.

To start, the herbs in the olive oil served at the table were dried, not fresh, which is really disappointing. I don' t like woody bits in my olive oil. It messes up the tasty bread they serve. Minorish point, that. More importantly, all three pasta dishes we ordered were really sub-par. The pasta was way overcooked in each dish; one of my friend's cavatappi was just falling into mush. On top of that, all dishes were way oversauced, to the point it was like pasta in soup and didn't resemble anything you would find in a ""real"" Italian restaurant. Sure, the flavors were still good--it's kind of difficult to mess up the awesomeness natively present in basil, garlic, or tomatoes. But darned if they didn't try.

The cream puff pastry, filled with pistachio gelato and topped with a dark chocolate syrup. SIGN ME UP FOR THAT!! It was heavenly.  The service was exceptional.

2010-05-27,5.0,"What can I say....We spent a wonderful Girls' Night Out with great dinner plans. A girlfriend of mine researched this place on none other than YELP and she decided to have dinner here with us all.  Though we made reservations, we still had to wait when we arrived (typical of many restaurants nowadays).  The entry way is literally at the door, so as you entry, you're already in the doorway for people to get in and out. I was quite weary when I had entered. Once we sat down, I noticed the tables were very tight. Then again, we did go here on a Saturday evening, and anywhere in the city at that time would be packed no matter if they are a bigger chain restaurant. Anyhow, we took one look at the menu and decided to order ""family style"" where we would all share the dishes instead of having one all to ourselves. We could have have been anymore right in that choice. Man-O-Man, when the waiter came to our tablet o serve our meals, we looked at them with BIG EYES, as if they were popping out!  These dishes are enormous. There is no way (unless you are capable) to finish a dish per person. Appetizer -  Mussels, Spicy Tomato Sauce: WOW. I can't eat spicy and I devoured this thing.  We attacked it like we've never had mussels before. The sauce was fabulous, and the mussels...you sure get your moneys worth.  There was so much flavor in each individual mussel that you could NOT go wrong on which ever one you chose.  We ended up sipping on the sauce buy scooping it up with the mussel shells (shhh, can you tell we're heifers?! :)) Meals - ALL 3 were FABULOUSLY TASTING!!! I can go into specific details, but words can't explain the magnificent taste you get. 1. Pollo Arrosto alla Romana  2. Salmone ala Fresca  3. Linguine al Sugo di Gamberi  We were so full that we were all disappointed that we weren't able to try their dessert. :(  We are definitely coming back to try new items on their menu as it seems to change often (possibly due to what is available in the markets) The staff is great as well. They are so considerate. Granted the place was already small, but they were VERy careful in where they stood and how they got by from table to table. Each person was so nice!  Though we sat near the entry, the hostess and bartenders would continuously give us a generous smile to not make it awkward that we were sitting so close (i felt less uncomfortable) This is my favorite little restaurant in the city for sure.",0.9905,0.83,0.127,0.043,0.5932227032227031

We arrived at 8 on a Monday night, anticipating that Mia Francesca would be busy, but we were promptly seated at a table toward the back and pleasantly far away from the cold of the front door. However, after being served with bread and water, we waited for 15 minutes before our waitress noticed that she had never seen before, and came over with a start. She was very apologetic, which was nice, but apparently she had never read Bruce Bruschel's piece in the NYTimes on 100 Things Restaurant Staffers Should Never Do because she proceeded to touch each of us, twice, as though that was a normal part of a restaurant apology. Maybe I'm too mid-western, but it seemed weird. When it came time to order a wine, we said that we were thinking about one, but curious about two others that we didn't know anything about. Our waitress admitted she didn't know anything about either of the wines, so she went to ask the bartender for his recommendation. She came back with knowledge about the tannic aspect of the wine, per our request, but nothing else (fruity? berry? smoky? throw me a bone here!). Whatever, we chose a wine that was fine, and our food came out within minutes of us placing our order (perhaps she'd bumped us to the front of the line?).

I slurped down the Pasta al Pomodorini: linguini sauteed in a 'spicy' cherry tomato sauce with garlic, olive oil and fresh herbs.  Perfectly flavorful, delicious and GLUTEN-FREE ITALIAN!  Purchase yourself one of their wonderful bottles of wine and you're set!  For those who doesn't have wheat allergies, don't miss out on their profiteroles with pistachio ice cream.  D-Lic!  Otherwise, the flourless chocolate cake with fresh berries is your match.",0.9881,0.769,0.181,0.05,0.4642000360750361

Awesome.  It was...awesome.  In the true fashion of the original sense of the meaning awesome...it was incredible.  Not just saying this cuz I spent a lot of time around surfers, but really that it was insanely awesome. The service was excellent, we had a Tuscan syrah, calamari appetizer, she had the salmon, I had some gnocchi, we shared the creme brulee and things were amazing.  We walked out of that restaurant thinking we'd found the best spot ever. After a Cubs game with our 2 friends we decided to share the magical goodness of Mia Frencesca.  After waiting no more than 15 minutes the 4 of us were seated in the worst table in the restaurant...in the traffic between the kitchen and rest of the restaurant. Okay whatever, bad tables happen, there are at least 2 of those in every restaurant, but that somehow doomed the entire evening. We got a bottle of pinot grigio, a cab and 2 appetizers...to get those 4 things it took almost 45 minutes.  Granted the restaurant was full of drunk Cubs fans, like ourselves, so it was probably not the best night for great service but man...it was horrible. Finally after 45 minutes of being completely done with the appetizers and almost done with the wine, we ordered another bottle and entree when our server finally came back. A half an hour after ordering, I finally had to flag down a random busser and ask him where our entrees were.  He promised us it would be out, even came back every 5 minutes for 20 minutes promising us our entrees. I'm so timid about asking for a manager, as is my girlfriend, but our friend we went with was not so much.  The manager came over and assured us that our entrees would be out in less than 5 minutes and that dessert was on the house...great, right? 20 minutes later our entrees arrived stale and cold. I know they'd sat in the heating window for an hour.  I had my dried up pork chops, my gf had her disgusting whitefish and after that we took our complimentary dessert to go. Lesson learned.  Do not go after a Cubs game. Second thoughts are even that we never want to go back again, but after the bruising of that meal heals, we'll probably go back and try again for that first experience, that Cubs game experience will never be forgotten.",0.9927,0.76,0.164,0.075,0.5078541479484875

I recommend sitting downstairs if you're a party of less than four and don't mind the tight quarters and loud atmosphere.

It is a totally different feel than downstairs and great for parties larger than four or that prefer a more mellow dining experience. I love that the menu is always changing. In all of my visits, I try a different entree each time. The carpaccio is fantastic as is the blue cheese and tomato salad. The creme brulee is also a nice treat to top off the meal. My parents always love going here when in town, as well. Since they are borderline wine snobs (kidding...sort of), my mom emails the manager to request the option of bringing one bottle of wine for our table if we order one from the restaurant, too.

The menu was a bit more limited than I would have liked. I really like menus that aren't longer than a page, but I found myself struggling to find anything I wanted to order. Also, the waiter's recommendations almost seemed like it was something the kitchen was pushing more than anything.  Our waiter at first tried to put on this big thick Italian accent, but he wasn't Italian? Very strange. Service really wasn't that great. Overall food was ""OK"" but nothing wow about it. Once our food was dropped we didn't hear back from our waiter and he stopped pouring us our wine.  For my entree I had a gnocci in a marinara sauce.  I kind of wish it were sauteed just a bit more than it was.  It was much better cold as leftovers. The service worked like a machine, a bit too mechanical which led to a perception of being rushed. Their patio out back is nice.   Food-wise, you can get Italian food like this in many places, though for the neighborhood this is your best bet for Italian (unless you're wanting fusion Italian--Socca would be better IMO).  Overall nothing was bad, but nothing was better than ""just OK"" ...

2009-08-02,5.0,"LOVE this place.  Mia Francesca can do no wrong.  What a beeotch, I probably gained 2 lbs after my meal here.  No matter which location I've been to, food and service (typically) is stellar.  We made 7pm reservations on a Friday night, and we were going to be late because we couldn't catch the purple or brown lines to save our life!  So I called at 6:50pm hoping they'd be able to push us back to 7:30, and they did!  The guy at the host stand was so super nice about it, I was completely surprised since it's Francesca's and they are always packed (but I guess it was still early for a Friday). So we get there at 7:30pm and they seat us right away and bring us water and menus.  And yummy fresh warm bread - love the oil and herbs!  They actually forgot to bring us the calamari we ordered, but they didn't charge us for it so I guess they forgot about it entirely.  Oh well. Our entrees came out really quickly. One girl got the risotto dinner portion.  It had too many veggies for my taste, but she loved it and said it was awesome.  I don't know the name, but another friend and I both ordered the shell pasta with prosciutto, peas and mushrooms in a tomato cream sauce.  I've had this before, and it was exactly the same as I remembered.  The sauce is to die for, it was a wonderful mix of flavors, the perfect proportion of pasta to meat/veggies.  Our other friend got the white fish and she said it was also very good, it looked huge, it covered the whole plate.  All of us ate every single last bite.  Too bad we ate all our bread, because I wanted to sop up every last bit of sauce. We got 2 desserts to share between the 4 of us.  We got the puff pastry with apple and caramel ice cream on top.  This dessert was really good, but it was really hard to split because the puff pastry was difficult to cut.  So I didn't get to enjoy this dessert as much because it was on the other side of the table - boo. We also got this cappuccino mousse that was shaped in a ball, and covered in this chocolate magic shell with whipped cream and hazelnuts.  It was really good, but a little too rich.  It would have been awesome with coffee though, which we didn't get.  Our bill came out to be about $22/person after tax, but not including tip.  This was a steal for as much as we enjoyed the food.   Service - our waiter was really nice, pretty attentive, but we did have to flag him down a few times, but not because we were waiting all that long, but because we were impatient and had to catch a show.  Water glasses were filled regularly.  They brought our food and desserts out a lot quicker than I thought they would since it was so busy. One con that I can mention is that this place is frickin' LOUD.  We were sitting right by the door, at a small table for 4, and we had to yell at the person across the table from us.  I could barely hear what my friend sitting right next to me was saying!  I can only imagine how loud it is in the back of the restaurant where there were more people.  So I would say this is definitely a place for a small to medium sized group.  It's also a good first date night with someone you're on the fence with, because it's so loud, if the date isn't going so well you can just blame it on the noise that you can't converse :)",0.9974,0.778,0.163,0.059,0.5539431556098221

This was a Saturday night around 630pm. There was a mob of people outside waiting for seats and inside that stood in the waiting area and and hovered over our table so we felt somewhat rushed.

The food was definitely better than The Olive Garden, but wasn't spectacular like I am reading these reviews that have said. We ordered three entrees and an appetizer to get a full take on the menu. The calamari was decent, and the dinner entrees were above average at best. I didn't walk out of there feeling disappointed, nor impressed.

Supposedly in changes once a month and this month seemed to be almost all chicken and seafood entrees. Not bad, but 2 of us had our hearts set on a cheese & pasta platter like manicotti or gnocci. They didn't have either! The meal I ended up getting was good, but when you have your heart set on something else, it's a little sad! Also, the place is LOUD. I went with my boyfriend and his family. Part of the conversation I couldn't hear so I just had to nod and hope they weren't asking me questions! So, I would say this place is not good for big parties.

I am really disappointed from my experience yesterday night. I'm not a fan of the small menu of this place (I already had a bad experience at the Bryn Mawr one:. 6 pastas and 6 main courses, most of them are very similar, so or you like it or you like it). The best part are probably the appetizers. We had a late reservation and we were put in the worse possible table, between the kitchen door and the back door that was constantly opened, with freezing air coming in, but this is not the real problem. We were rushed by our waiter that probably had better things to do, since he kicked out a 4 people table and a 2 people table that came after us and left before us (we left just after 11, not that late). My real disappointment was my ""pesce alla livornese"", that is a delicious recipe, simple but tasty with olive oil, crushed tomatoes, capers, garlic, olives, olive oil and something else.  It was a long time I didn't have this dish, so I ordered it, thinking that since they have such a small menu, they are pretty good at that. They brought me a tilapia with a lot of onions on top and a mild sauce similar to a vodka sauce all around. I really can't believe it.  I was hungry and I was just enjoying the nice company of friends that I didn't see for the whole winter, so I let go. They were ok (not happy) with their food, so I didn't care much. The dessert was pushed quickly and I hate when the check is dropped on the table while I'm still sipping my espresso or still having the dessert.

The servings are generous, but not overly huge. The quality of the food is very high, and everything is usually very tasty.  The menu is hand-written and then photocopied. I am not sure if it changes daily or what, but the selection is always fresh. Despite not being very big, there are always multiple things on the menu that sound good to me and it's tough to make a decision! They do a standard brushcetta and a special one that is always changing. They always have several pizzas, pastas and entrees. They are accommodating of special requests; if there is a chicken dish that is not boneless, they'll gladly make it with boneless chicken breast if you ask. The prices are in line with what you get. The service is generally pretty good. The staff is friendly but professional, and they're not attitude-y or stuck up. Now, the downsides: There can be a long wait for a table sometimes, especially on the weekends. In fact, last time I tried to go they said 2.5 hours! Needless to say, I went somewhere else. But that was uncharacteristically long for them, so I don't penalize them for it. The upside of the waiting is that they have three bars (main dining room, coach house and upstairs). The other downside is that the main dining room is VERY loud and VERY crowded. I don't really like to eat down there. Insider tip: Ask to get seated upstairs.

Our appetizers (fried calamari - lightly breaded and fried perfectly so you could still admire the true fish taste; bruschetta - loved the variation and fresh bread) came quickly as did our entrée's despite a packed house.  I had a taste for salmon but our server recommended a variation on what was offered on the menu.  I tend to trust servers with opinions deterring from the menu, and she nailed it with salmon covered in a wild mushroom medley that I just loved.  No one was disappointed in their food, although my dad said he would have enjoyed a bit more sausage in his pasta dish. The desserts were a grand slam too... All in all with about 2 drinks a piece, 2 appetizers, an entrée and 2 desserts for the table to share we left there having spent about $250, including tax and tip.  Definitely a value for the quality and atmosphere.  I will gladly return.",0.9936,0.709,0.232,0.059,0.5816

For Dinner I had the Portabella/Scallop entree.  The scallops that happened to land on my plate look much smaller than what I had scene go by before... I wonder if that had something to do with us being there at the end of the night and that's all they had.  Anyways the Scallops were over cooked and the general dish was boring with no thought.  My friend had the grouper that was drench in an over powering tarragon butter.  My girlfriend's pasta was amazingly flavorless -- some mushroom pasta debacle. Dessert where decent, we had the Tiramisu and their special of the night.  Both which were polished off.  I'm not sure though were it was because they were that good or just in comparison they rocked and we were hungry from not eating our other food..... OK I admit I ate all of mine but no one else did.  I'm just a hungry guy and those scallops were tiny ;). I've got no desire to ever go back, there are way too many other restaurants in this city with this style, price range and much better food.  Buyer beware  I believed the hype and was extremely disappointed.",0.9236,0.839,0.101,0.06,0.5354954304954305

2006-12-20,4.0,"I first went there because I had a gift certificate from North Community Bank, and I keep going back because they serve decent Italian food in my   neighborhood. Their menu changes frequently, so don't make a mistake of going back there for a specific dish without checking with them first like I did. I have tried 7-8 different dishes, and I think your best bets are pizzas, pork chops, and flourless chocolate cake(or whatever they call it there)  I tried a couple of seafood dishes. They were pretty good, but not the best I've had in the city.  The best pizza in the city is served at Spacca Napoli (if you like Italian style pizza). For two, you will easily spend 70 or more. There is room for improvement when it comes to service.",0.9861,0.767,0.233,0.0,0.36421568627450973
2006-12-14,2.0,"Why does everyone love this place so much? Everyone I know takes visiting friends and relatives here as if it is the showpiece restaurant of the city.  I got fooled into doing this about a year ago.  I took my aunt and uncle there with my girlfriend.  The food is fine, even good I guess, but... About halfway through my meal (some kind of pasta with meat) I bit into something hard.  I pulled it out of my mouth to discover that I had bitten into a string of STEEL WOOL.  I showed it to the waiter, and he said ""I'm sorry, that is from one of our scrub brushes in the kitchen, it happens every once in a while.""  He asked me if I would like another meal.  I did not because I was halfway finished and this sort of thing doesn't really effect my desire to finish the meal.  I was just glad that it happened to me and not one of the people that I had invited there.  Of course my meal was free, but that does not change the fact that they were not surprised to find BRILLO PADS in the food.",0.8286,0.884,0.084,0.032,0.6583333333333333

Update:  I have gone back a few times and agree they have good food.  But I would recommend going during not peak hours because of the loudness.  Everyone I go with agrees that the noise levels are unacceptable",0.7351,0.823,0.116,0.061,0.5003535353535352

The room downstairs does get noisy and busy.  My husband and I often eat at the upstairs bar which is a room you can rent out.  In fact, we held our wedding reception here.  It is perfect for a small party - 75 max.  They treat you like a queen and the pricing is very reasonable and the food of course amazing!",0.978,0.774,0.213,0.013,0.5385185185185185

This policy is not the problem, but the management should do a better job communicating it to patrons.
