2017-09-04,5.0,"I take the El to Irving Park station.  I exit the train and realize I'm in the mIddle of an expressway.  This a long way from my centrally located Miracle Mile hotel, and it better be good.  And, after figuring out how to get off the major arterial road, lo and behold, I find this place.  It smells good.  I enter and annoy the hell out of the greeter, asking him way too many questions about what type of BBQ'd meats and sides I should order.  He graciously answers all of my questions, rather than giving in to his natural impulses to request that I leave and never ever return again.   I go up to counter, and order everything he advised.   The counter girl looks at me in admiration, unaware that I had mined all my knowledge from the greeter.  That admiration fades as I request every type of BBQ sauce available.  Her and the greeter exchange knowing glances, but continue to smile and pretend I am not annoying them greatly.  It's that impeccable midwestern charm. The food arrives.  The ribs rock.  The chopped and pulled brisket are each good in their own way.  The side dishes, beans and mac n cheese are really tasty.  This is really good BBQ.  I begin deliberating with my guest about whether this is Texas BBQ or Southern BBQ or St Louis BBQ (is there such a thing?).  My eating companion doesn't care, and says that it is really good, and that nobody likes a pretentious foodie who tries to sub-classify food.  I am so jacked up on meat, that I brush aside the injurious criticism, and gently assure myself that it is not my fault I am dining with a BBQ rube. I leave content that this would be a top 3 BBQ joint in my own dour burgh",0.9884,0.783,0.165,0.052,0.5203703703703704
2017-09-04,5.0,"While on a baseball trip to the midwest USA my wife and I were interested in sampling the local barbecue in different cities. I have to admit that the incipient violent reputation that Chicago has won was in the back of my mind when we pulled up in front of this establishment. In my naivete I had expected a higher end experience, however, it turns out that the best barbecue is not necessarily found in upper crust neighbourhoods. Once inside, however, I WAS impressed by the cleanliness, courtesy, and efficiency of the largely Latino staff. The room itself houses the kitchen and ordering counter and patrons sit at picnic tables, with a self dispensing soda machine nearby. The young woman who took our order was brusque but pleasant and took the time to explain to a neophyte exactly how St Louis ribs were different from baby back ribs. The whole area is suffused by the mouthwatering aroma of barbecue. My combination platter of baby back ribs, and St Louis ribs with sides of macaroni and cheese and cole slaw was flavourful succulent and of excellent quality. My wife enjoyed her pulled pork sandwich. All the while we were attended by a server who would remove our leftovers and keep giving us a steady supply of moist towelletes. I would not take my glove wearing mother in law here, but the food was simply fantastic. I will certainly return the next time I'm in Chicago.",0.9902,0.827,0.164,0.009,0.48066666666666663

It was good but not great in many ways.  The service was friendly, the decorations were cute, and sitting outside on a warm summer day was a nice touch.  I expected to eat the best barbecue in the city though. The ribs were good and I would recommend them. Came off the bone fairly easily. Had a good rub on them. I wasn't crazy about the provided sauces though and the smoky flavor didn't come through the meat as much as I would have liked.  The biggest let down for me was the corn bread. It was tiny, dry and not very flavorful.  Would I go back? Yes. Is is the best Q place in the city- No. I would recommend southern cut, q, or lillies q over smoque.

Get the corn bread because it's just so good and crumbly. The fries actually were good ---thick and crispy like the ones at Five Guys, and they go well with the ribs. Turns out the cole slaw comes with the ribs already, so that didn't count as a side. But the slaw, while fresh, could have used a little more wetness --as in some creaminess (mayo). However, the crunch of the cabbage added to the nice texture experience of the meal. I liked the bbq sauce a lot, but would have also welcomed a spicier one. Finally, I couldn't leave without the peach cobbler, which I enjoyed later that night. I like how they prepare all of their sides in these little pie containers. So practical.

Good but had higher expectation given other food.  Beans needed either more brown sugar or a kick from rub.  Too middle of the road.  Love the vibe of the neighborhood.  We dined inside on one trip and outside the next.  Staff very friendly.   They move you through fast.  Very efficient.,0.9947,0.643,0.339,0.018,0.5138636363636364

2017-06-26,5.0,"Two things to preface: 1) I love BBQ and, as a result, have a pretty low threshold for a 5-star review; 2) My favorite BBQ in Chicago (and that of many other Yelpers) is Green Street Smoked Meats, so I'm going to (potentially unfairly) write this review in this context. Overall, Green Street has better sides and a better non-food experience; Smoque has better meat and better price points. But both are *amazing* and you cannot go wrong with either. ATMOSPHERE/SERVICE: Whereas Green Street presents itself as the trendier location-- barn/warehouse decor, West Loop locale, etc., Smoque is more of a neighborhood joint. It's in a more residential area, with plenty of parking on side streets (there's even a small parking lot, suburban style!). The interior is pretty bare-bones, like countless BBQ joints in the South. It's more authentic, but, at the same time, I'm a bit of a sucker for the warehouse vibe, and it's a little more unique. Both places can have long lines for food, but Smoque has more limited seating and kind of botched our order at first. Edge: Green Street. SIDES: Green Street's beans are the best. Smoque's are smokier, but less complex and tangy, and maybe a little watery. Still good. Smoque's cornbread is tasty but small. Their coleslaw is vinegary (a plus) and full of raw onion (which I found to be not great). Their mac n cheese is tasty, but I'm not a mac n cheese guy with BBQ. Green Street's sides are more varied and bigger. But neither place has collards! WHERE ARE THE COLLARD GREENS, GUYS?! Edge: Green Street. MEAT: I have really only had sliced brisket at both places. Green Street's, while very tasty, is not as good as Smoque's. Why? The fat. Smoque's brisket (at least the slices I got) was laced with amazing, melt-in-your-mouth smoked fat. If I could, I'd order their fat trimmings and spread it on a cracker or eat it with a spoon. Don't go to Smoque if you think that saturated fat is really bad for you. $$: Smoque is cheaper. Also, it's BYOB (but only indoors). I'd say: go to Green Street if you're not so much into BBQ as you are into the sides and/or your main purpose is for the social aspect of eating out. Go to Smoque if you are serious about your smoked meat product.",0.967,0.867,0.095,0.038,0.5045671259956974

2017-05-25,4.0,"I've been to Nashville and I can honestly say that I have never sampled food that was just as good as one of the areas that made it popular. I wish Smoque offered more food combination meals, while also offering additional flavors of sauce. On the other hand, I was able to put my own variety together and still walk away paying a reasonable price. For my late lunch and early dinner, I got the sliced brisket sandwich with mac n cheese and coleslaw. I also had a craving for ribs, so I got the St. Louis half rack. Thinking these portions wouldn't fill me up, I was only able to finish the sandwich and mac. With your sandwich, you get to sample both of their sauces, a Carolina sauce, and the Memphis. For both the sandwich and ribs, I used the Memphis. I found that the vinegar-based Carolina concoction was a little too overpowering for both meats.   I have yet to visit a restaurant that serves a decent mac n cheese. The noodles are always too soft and too girthy for my taste. Smoque rates the same, and like other restaurants, nails the crusty top and an actual perfect pairing of cheeses, boosting that cheesy punch we all look for in this classic American pasta dish. I ended up scooping most of it on top of the brisket, so my sandwich had cheese. It must be a faux pas to ask for cheese on top of your barbecued meat. I certainly did not see it as an option to add cheese to your sandwich on the menu. It really made the sandwich.  I had the St. Louis half rack for breakfast. It reheated nicely (under a low heat) in my toaster oven. I was surprised that the ends of the ribs were dry, and the center of the rib meat was where you got the best moist and fatty bites of meat. I don't think that my toaster oven is responsible for that. On my next visit, I am going for the leaner baby-back ribs. I'm hoping that the leaner meat will call for a slower heating process, making an evenly moist rack, sides to center.",0.9899,0.872,0.122,0.006,0.49157738095238096

2017-05-22,5.0,"Review #3453! whoo!  Was going to be in the area Sunday evening and so I finally stopped by for the first time. It was 8pm, we found parking right in front (the street across is residential only though), the place was busy but boo and I were next in line, so very little wait...great start. They were closing in an hour at 9, so the fact that the place was still so lively was very impressive. Other reviews make it out to seem that the place is tiny with virtually no seating, but they actually do have a decent amount, especially with the outdoor tables. However, since this place is always at capacity, I can see the criticism. Service was exceptional. Especially as newbies, we felt very comfortable. Even during our short wait in line, we were assured that a table would be waiting for us after placing our order. During our meal, we were asked if we needed anything. Staff ended up getting a to-go box for us, even though we were right next to them. They even suggested and gave us a separate bag for the sauces and sides in case of spillage. Also, we did not have to wait long at all for our food to be ready. Between us, we got the full slab of baby back ribs platter (slaw with brisket chili, fries), sliced brisket platter (slaw with cornbread, baked beans), tasting of sausage, and the bread pudding. Some of the reviews say the sides are not good here. I disagree. The baked beans were I think the best I've had. They were very smoky which I enjoyed. Fries were perfect. The brisket chili was tasty. Their slaw was also top notch! Instead of the usual creamy slaws, this was bright and refreshing and made for perfect breaks between all the other heavier fare. The only thing that was a bit subpar was the cornbread. The sausage was perfect. The ribs were yummy, somewhat falling off the bone, but not too much. The brisket was also very solid and paired perfectly with the Carolina vinegar sauce. My boo loved their Memphis - all around sauce. I'm not a sweet tooth, but that bread pudding was amazing.  You know a BBQ place is good when there aren't additional sauces at the table and that the food is enjoyed simply with what they give you. There are many BBQ places in the city that are certainly tasty but not authentic bbq, in that their lack of smoky meats is compensated with other components - sauce and other flavorings. Here at Smoque, the meat speaks for itself and their simple perfected sauce and seasonings only elevate it. It's also a good sign that their menu is on the limited side. Smoque definitely has the charm of what BBQ should be and is definitely the best in the city, while I'm sure TX and other popular places have it beat. I'm dying to come back and try their peach cobbler and consume more delicious BBQ. Prices were also much cheaper than other BBQ places I've been to while the portions were appropriate. For all that we got for under $50 after tax and their amazing service, Smoque deserves all the hype. *Definitely choose wisely on when to come though.",0.9991,0.747,0.211,0.042,0.5774126984126984

2017-05-14,5.0,"In the last six years since I first reviewed them I have eaten lots of BBQ from all over the country, my city and different states and Smoque is still my number 2 BBQ place with Pappys in St. Louis the reigning king at the number one spot at this point in time. I stopped getting brisket because I have been bitten so many with shoe leather crap from lots of places but after having Smoque which is at this point the only place I will order brisket because it's constantly pleasing. I get the sliced, not chopped brisket which is always juicy/tender/melt on your mouth. It has a small amount fat for flavor and a nice bark on a very fresh soft/light bun, sauce on the side because it's not needed but I use it. The ribs are just like brisket, moist, fall off the bone with a great bark that needs no sauce and I never sauce the ribs. The St. Louis ribs are not as big and meaty as other places but it's quality makes up for that. From my experience, lots of BBQ places do good ribs and have subpar sides but I actually have liked all the sides from Smoque. There is a reason that every time I go over, it's controlled chaos and busy no mater what time it is because it's just very good. Since my first review smart phones came out and I can post pictures today of my review. # 2 is not a bad spot for my travels in BBQ land and that's why I keep going back, not as much since I moved from Chicago.",0.983,0.81,0.142,0.048,0.4926604554865424

Now, onto the food!  We got the baby back ribs, and they were generally soft and tasty.  However there were some tougher parts that poked the roof of my mouth.  The portion sizes left something to be desired - you get more meat on the ribs than at Carson's but not much more.   We got the chili, French fry, mac and cheese, peach cobbler, and pecan bread pudding on the sides.  They were all OK, but the peach cobbler crust was off the hook!  Give that a try, and the pecan pudding was really good too. Ask them if they can leave the sauce off though that was too sweet for me. Service was the best part.  Even though it is a fast casual place, everyone was very friendly, polite, and happy to help out.  The owner even stepped in when we wanted to do a second order and put it in for us (so we didn't have to wait in crazy line again).   Overall, a solid place.  If they had a bigger space and put more meat on the bones at same price/quality, I would give a higher rating for sure.",0.9908,0.829,0.155,0.016,0.4156130268199234

2017-04-11,5.0,"A friend and I stopped by Smoque on a Sunday afternoon around 5pm for a quick bite to eat. He was visiting from Minneapolis and Smoque was his pick after hearing stellar reviews all the way up there. When we arrived most of the tables were taken and there were about 15 people in line in front of us. We gave our name to the host and hoped a table would be available when our food was ready but we knew this place had to be good given how packed it was. The menu had plenty of options from brisket, pork, ribs, many sides, etc. Pretty typical for a BBQ joint. Just staring at the menu made my mouth water... After about a 10 minute wait we made it to the counter. We decided to order a few things and split them as the menu didn't feature a multiple meat platter. I ordered a half rack of baby back ribs with fries and my friend ordered the brisket sandwich with mac & cheese and coleslaw. Within minutes of ordering I got tapped on the shoulder and the host had our table ready. Perfect! Like a well oiled machine.  Within 10 minutes or so our meal was ready and it didn't disappoint. The half rack of ribs had 6 ribs that fell clean off the bone, the mark of a perfect rib. The sauce that came with the ribs was a good compliment for meal and I couldn't stop dipping my fries in. And the fries themselves were some of the best fries I've ever had. Delicious potatoey goodness! The brisket sandwich was great too! The meat was smoky and tender and had a perfect char to it on the outside. If I had no self restraint I could have eaten ribs and a brisket sandwich. And finally, the mac & cheese was the perfect way to top this meal. I'm a sucker for cheese and carbs so... Overall, Smoque is a bit out of the way but definitely worth the trip.

Yeah that's the good kind! To my dismay, their sides were not pleasing. I had their mac n cheese which was baked and crusted and their cornbread. Both were disappointing. The cornbread was dry and the mac n cheese was bleh. They're a bit frugal with their BBQ sauce so get up there and ask for it. They also serve all orders with their housemade Cole slaw.

Then, one day, I was watching the Food Network and boom! Smoque was featured as 1 of the 25 best BBQ joints in the country. Now this review is probably a year overdue, but I feel like now that I have been to Smoque several times, I can provide a more accurate review. Overall, the meat is DELICIOUS. The ribs have always been delicious, although I will say the tenderness depending on the day can lack consistency. My other favorite meat is the sliced brisket. It's almost impossible to eat with a fork because of how tender it is. I also love that Smoque offers a variety of BBQ sauces that cater to individual preferences for BBQ styles. You can get Carolina, Memphis, or my favorite Spicy sauce. The loss of a star is for the sides. While Smoque excels in their meat, the sides are average at best. The macaroni and cheese may be cheesy but lacks flavor. The cornbread and chili are nothing to write home about. Beans are just beans. Now dessert, however, is something that cannot be missed. As someone who is not a fan of bread pudding, this is one of the best I have had. The salted bourbon caramel sauce...O M G. Best way to eat it: heated up! The peach cobbler is also delicious.

So, at 11:00 am. on a Sunday, be prepared people will start arriving at the open. By 11:15, all seats were full. That was a good sign already. A restaurant with that kind of regular traffic has to be good. Between two people, we ordered a full slab of ribs with mac and cheese and cornbread and the brisket platter with a side of pulled pork, coleslaw, beans and fries. First of all, I am gluten and dairy free. I was so happy when the manager confirmed that all meats and sauces are gluten free. He also assured me that most of the sides were, too. Including the fries!!! You have NO idea how happy I was since fries are usually a no-no since they share a fryer with gluten items.  This was a lot of food! Talk about meat coma. We barely finished and were pleasantly stuffed. The meats come without the sauces (sauces are on the side) but some of the meats are so well seasoned (like the brisket) that you don't need it, unless you want an extra kick. I LOVED the brisket. So tender and flavorful. Melt in your mouth good. The pulled pork was good (perfectly cooked and not dry) but seasoning was nothing special. That meat definitely needed a sauce to help it out. The ribs were dry-rub and very tasty. I enjoyed my baked beans and oil/vinegar coleslaw. The fries are a HUGE portion, even for two people. It was too much considering all the other food we got. Fries were delicious, though! Perfectly cooked with the right amount of salt. I was told the mac and cheese was probably one of the best my date had with baked breadcrumbs on top. Cornbread was good and moist.  I thought the crowds moved quickly from order to being served. Tables were always cleaned and staff quick to point you to an empty one once it opened up. Decor was hip and fun. On a Sunday, I'm sure there were more families but the noise did not become bothersome.

Especially when I'm trying to get my lazy self moving on a Saturday to try to beat the lunch crowds. Always a plus. The place is pretty small, but it is a food manufacturing powerhouse. They keep the line moving, they have plenty of people in the kitchen moving around like a well-oiled machine, and orders come out fairly quickly (which once you smell the sweet, sweet smell of smoked meat, waiting is not really option.)  The ribs are off the chain, the brisket I had was a little dry but still delicious, and the sides were solid. The peach cobbler is always a favorite and you can't really go wrong with the mac and cheese. They are one of the few places where these types of sides are cooked individually in foil containers for that extra feel of a personalized meal. They have a solid selection of not-so-run-of-the-mill sodas as well to top off your meal with delicious, unnecessary calories. Overall, solid BBQ (not the best I've ever had in my life, but definitely solid) and fast turn-around times make Smoque a pretty great choice for BBQ in Chicago.",0.9963,0.748,0.234,0.018,0.572373949579832
2017-02-07,5.0,"As any fat guy does, I have a principled approach to BBQ.  My ingrained religious belief regarding this most American of food crafts is as follows.  You have 3 sorts of BBQ joints.  The first and most common is where the establishment focuses solely on the quality of the meat/sauces.  This is no doubt one of the most important qualities in what constitutes good BBQ, but it doesn't equate to a holistic approach to what makes this a 5 start restaurant.  The second type has amazing side options, think fires, corn bread, collard greens, etc; but their sauces are lack luster and their ribs are often boiled.  I appreciate the attention to the lesser details here, but you can't ignore the meats.  The final and rarest of the three is the BBQ joints that Smoque finds it self in.  They have solid ribs, a good variety of sauces, and sides so good you'll continue eating long after the meat sweats have set in.  Smoque has, in my husky opinion, mastered the trifecta tasty.  I don't like going to Smoque often only because I always eat to the point where I hate myself.  The portions are so healthy they will ensure you won't be.  The sides are so delectable; you'll find yourself sneaking some off your friend's tray.  But the meats, oh the meats, are all simply amazing.  My entire review is about why Smoque is so unique being in this 3rd tier of BBQ establishments.   Let's be honest for a minute, you don't care what I ordered, and I won't waste your time by telling you.  Let me just say that everything, every rib, brisket, pulled pork/chicken, and side is worth your order.  Come early, come often, and come in relaxed fitting pants.  It's BYOB so you can even wash it all down with your favorite beer.  What more can you ask for in a neighborhood restaurant?  Maybe a fitness center next door?  I wouldn't go mind you, but the option would be nice.",0.9952,0.77,0.184,0.046,0.5113492063492064

2016-12-23,4.0,"This place has it down. It was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives...and it is really worth the visit. We came from the south side because we heard it was a thing...and it is.  Food...they know BBQ. Our party of four had (1) chopped brisket platter (5 stars), (2) sliced brisket platter (5 stars), (3) 1/2 baby back ribs (3 stars), (4) pulled pork (5 stars)...so we tried a lot of stuff and with only one exception it was exceptional BBQ. The brisket really stuck out...tender, moist, flavorful throughout the meat, and whether you get it chopped or sliced it was a very nice hefty serving. The flavor permeates all the way through the meat (hence the Smoque name I guess); the smoke flavor is not just painted on top once the meat is done but slow-cooked all the way through. I'd get brisket again. The only off point was the ribs...they had a wonderful bark on them and the same smokey flavor but the meat was a bit dry and tough. They were baby-back though so maybe that was to be expected...but my vote goes for the brisket anyway. The platters come with slaw and two sides...we tried cornbread (straight up with no herbs and 4 stars), fries (with the skin on and 4 stars), coleslaw (vinegary and 4 stars), mac and cheese (creamy and just like Kraft does it and 5 stars), and BBQ beans (with small pieces of BBQ meat in it and 5 stars), and one of us tried the pecan bread pudding (perfect foil for the BBQ flavors and 5 stars). The meals come with two 5 star BBQ sauces...Memphis (has a tang to it) and Carolina (thinner and vinegary). Service...they know how to run a place. This place rests on its food and not its ambiance, it is simply a store front operation with a bunch of wooden tables and chairs...the walls are painted and there aren't any drapes or mood lighting (just good BBQ). Get in line when you arrive and work your way up to the counter (no taking a seat until you have some food). The check in check out is easy. Pay for your order at the cashier (the kitchen streams off behind her) and one of the staff directs you to a seat...this way people not eating don't hog the seats to early...this is well thought out. Service was always in the background...they don't hurry you at all, but when your done the table is cleaned in a second. They have enough staff to take care of the room size...probably more staff than they need. Friendly and efficient. They also have a big carryout clientele...you have a stream of people just picking up...so don't be afraid of the line...it is worth it also.

That said I am somewhat of a snob.   Disclaimer done,  the is a solid meal.  I order a 1/2 & 1/2 platter with brisket and sausage.  The Star was the sausage, while not a traditional chicago hot link, it is well above the grilled Eckrich sausage many of their peers serve. For a ""real"" hot link see Hecky's or Uncle J's (it is not fine ground). In fairness, they call it Texas Sausage and not a Hot Link.  Brisket was bland to me, maybe an off day, but it failed the ""I can eat this without sauce"" test.  (See green street). I know that that test is controversial but it works for me.   I would eat here again as the staff was friendly and the meal came at a very reasonable price considering what some of the peers charge for the same.  I really liked the music and all in all it is pretty chill.

Regretted ordering the extra coleslaw because each platter actually comes with a side already, so we ended up with 3 coleslaws. Also tried both the Memphis and Carolina BBQ sauce. Both different in their own way. - I liked the St. Louis ribs a bit more. It had more meat than the baby backs and a lot less dry. There was just enough smokiness. - The sausages were juicy and not too salty, I basically ate majority of it.  - The pulled pork was okay, a little on the dry side and lacking flavor.  - Sliced brisket was BOMB. I tend to find brisket too dry but this place was tender, juicy, with just enough fat to balance the meat.  - Corn bread was good when warm, but was a little dry once it cooled down. - Fries were piping hot, fresh, and perfectly crisp on the outside. So good, we ended up buying seconds! Large, that is! - Coleslaw has just enough vinegar to balance all the meat.  - Mac n cheese was worth getting another, creamy and oh, so cheesy. - Brisket chili, I could've done without...

2016-09-14,4.0,"Out of all of the restaurants I researched before coming to Chicago, Smoque's stood at the top of the list for nearly every website I came across. Needless to say, I don't think it was the BEST BBQ I've ever had in my life, but it was definitely good. The line for this place can go out of the door during peak times so I would suggest getting there a little earlier. The cool thing about this place (and other places in Chicago) is that it's BYOB. Had I known that, I would've gone to the liquor store to grab some drinks beforehand. I got a rib combo because I couldn't decide if I wanted the St. Louis style ribs or baby back ribs. If you like more meat on your ribs, then you'll opt for the baby back ribs. If you like more fat and something more tender, you'll like the St. Louis style ribs. Personally, I liked the St. Louis styled ribs better. They had much more flavor and were just tastier in general. The baby back ribs were a little on the dry side because it had more meat on the bone but you can just dip the pork in the Memphis style sauce that they provide. For sides, I got an order of the mac n cheese and cornbread. Both came in small portions but I thought it was just the right amount of food. The mac n cheese was average in my opinion. I also love gumbo so I had to try the gumbo special that they had going on. It was pretty good! Coming from SoCal, I've had the privilege to try Phil's BBQ. This is what I kept thinking of as I was eating my ribs and I don't think Smoque's surpasses Phil's. However, that doesn't mean that this place isn't worth trying because I do think they serve up some quality ribs here! Not to mention, it's BYOB!",0.9946,0.839,0.156,0.006,0.4877304147465438

2016-09-12,5.0,"Y'know, everyone has different tastes and ideas as to what constitutes good BBQ.  For me, Smoque is on top of the heap with the best St. Louis ribs I've found in Chicagoland.  Not everyone who has accompanied me to Smoque would agree, though. Here's my take: Their ribs are very meaty and tender, with a bit of char on the outside.  Slow-cooking melts away most of the fat.  The woody-smoky flavor is just right and does not overwhelm the flavor of the pork.  The meat does not quite fall off the bone, but you don't have to do much gnawing either.  Ribs are served dry, with the sauce on the side.  The ""Memphis"" BBQ sauce is better'n any I've had in Memphis. Sides?  So far, I have had the fries, baked beans, corn bread, and cole slaw,  All are topnotch.   Staff keeps an eye on the dining area, making sure that needs are met.  If you prefer your ribs non-smoky and drowned in a sweet BBQ sauce, you might be disappointed.  But if you're a fan of truly authentic 'cue, Smoque is 4 U.",0.924,0.821,0.132,0.047,0.519094304388422

The sausage had a good bit of heat (a nice surprise, since they usually back off a bit so as not to offend!) but was so INCREDIBLY greasy that it seemed to be trying to slide down my throat before I'd really chewed it.  Potato salad was good, but middle of the road, and an extra 0.50 for pickled jalapenos seemed a bit of a stretch (like I was being asked to pony up extra for the ketchup on a hotdog, or a pickle on my cheeseburger). I smoke food often (brisket, ribs, turkey, cheese, you name it!), and mine is simply (not to put TOO fine a point on it) better, and I do NOT say that about every single place I try... The Meat House, in Tinley Park, for example, turns out what I HOPE to make some day.   I think the long lines at this new downtown location can be attributed to the novelty of having a BBQ place handy, and the fact that it DOES smell good (they must be pumping the smoke out into the restaurant, because very little actually gets into the meat).  But it IS overpriced ($8+ for less meat than you'd get in a decent burger) and my guess is that those lines will taper off pretty soon, once folks twig to that.  I'd gladly pay more for better BBQ, and while this isn't (exactly) a rip-off, it's definitely a case of getting LESS than you paid for....",0.9925,0.861,0.131,0.009,0.43665023248356577

Baby backs:  Just fine.  Mostly lean, juicy, a little smoky.   St. Louis style ribs;  tough and dry.  You do need a knife, and most of the fat and juice has rendered, leaving a dry, chalky rib.  Sauce can't save the dry ribs.

2016-07-21,3.0,"Despite the accolades heaped on this place, including its inclusion in the eater 38 Chicago, I can only give it between 2 and 3 stars at this time.  It had been a 5 for me, and i was a weekly regular, but then I started getting painfully dry St. Louis ribs. I course-corrected. I made it my Sunday brunch-of-choice, getting there when they opened the doors on Sunday mornings, and usually focusing on those St. Louis ribs, but sometimes on the sliced brisket. This worked for a while, but inconsistently.  Last night I ate there for dinner. The sliced brisket was a B+ for me, almost perfect. Just too dry and fat-free for me. The ribs, a D+, with a few bites here and there that satisfied, but most bites nearly cardboardy.  Also, I am majorly bummed that, quite a while a go, they made their peach cobbler, which had been a side you could order as one of your accompanying sides, into a stand-alone non-side. As much as I loved sides like the fries (but who isn't at least capable of great fries in Chicago?), I would often get peach cobblers as both my sides. Now, I never get the peach cobbler because I'm not going to pay extra for it, and get more food than I want or need just to do so. This therefore is my goodbye note to Smoque. I loved, loved, loved you when you were great, which I donlt think you are anymore. Also, when there were far fewer options, for me it was Honey 1 or you, depending on what I craved.

Fries we got a hefty order). Price all in of order: $40 Dirtiness factor: 10 (my hands were slimy AF after gnawing on ribs for a half hour) Hype: 10/10 Cons: baby back ribs carries the smoke flavor a little too much. Regular St. Louis ribs were way tastier and held their pork flavor better Carolina vs Memphis bbq sauce: I liked the Memphis sweet sauce better. My fiancé couldn't stopped eating the vinegar Caroline sauce. Won/win situation  Most recommended food order: sliced brisket... It was softer than a baby's bottom... Couldn't even pick it up with a dang fork! Would I go back: probably not because of the location but if anyone asks for a good bbq place I'd def send them over!

What more could you ask for in one of the city's best BBQ spots? My friend and I decided to come here for our monthly get-together. This time, we were down to take the Blue Line all the way up to Irving Park to try this place. On a Thursday evening, it wasn't packed at all. You go in, order at the counter, and then take a seat. Each of us opted for the St. Louis Ribs ($16) and the Sliced Brisket ($14), and shared the meat. Mmm, the brisket here was definitely on point! It fell apart so easily, so you know it was very much on the tender side. We ordered our ribs dry-rub with their Memphis and Carolina sauces on the side. It was delicious as well, but I think I prefer the brisket. As for dipping sauce, the Carolina was definitely my choice- sweet and tangy! The platters each come with two individual sides, and hands down our favorites were the baked beans and the mac & cheese. I've never tasted beans like these before. They were smoky and downright delicious! As for the later, the baked layer of crust on top was perfect in trapping the cheesy goodness underneath.

Prices aren't even that bad. Anywhere in the suburbs will charge you similarly.  This isn't a must visit of Chicago that I would suggest to my visiting friends, but it's darn close. I would put this above Girl and the Goat but below Lawrence Fish Market in my biased and arbitrary rankings of best restaurants. Afterall, it's a huge pain to get to.  Still, enough bitching.

My friend and I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and cornbread with peppers based off the recommendation of a complete stranger.. Yes sometimes I let a stranger tell me what I should try but it doesn't mean that I will always do it..  However to our surprise the pull pork sandwich was really good and flavorful and they did not skimp on the meat. It was enough meat on that sandwich to make two. They gave two kind of sauces so I guess it's up to you to decide which one you want and just dig in. You will be in love from the first bite. The cornbread was not impressive at all. It came in an individual cup and the pepper came in a separate cup as well. I thought when they cornbread and peppers, that the peppers would be cooked into the cornbread but nope I was wrong. Instead they give you peppers that look like they belong on top of nachos in a movie theater. So I didn't care for that.  But don't let the sad cornbread stop you from visiting this place because the pull pork sandwich alone is worth the trip. I will be back to try the ribs .",0.9801,0.776,0.171,0.053,0.5313888888888889

I was super excited to try the highest rated bbq in Chicago.  I came here with a serious fan, so even better!  But sadly, imo the bbq is not what I would call good enough to rate as great, & if this is truly the best bbq in Chicago, I'm staying home in LA for my q from here on out. Brisket - nice bark, but even when I requested fatty PLEASEplease fatty, what we got was very much on the lean side.  So, sadly not marbled fatty - or fat layer fatty, and so not flavorful enough for me.  This brisket is the reason I tried their sauces - which is not a positive thing to say.  Pass. Baby back ribs - delish taste - but on the dry side and again, pretty lean (not a compliment coming from me).  Pass. Mac & Cheese - thank god it's small, bc it's really gooooood - tender cheesy baked sauce parts, cheesy crusty top, yum! Chili - great tasting, if you love lots of kidney beans Sausage - juicy, flavorful, not overly salty - prob my fave out of all the meats, but I wouldn't come back just for this The lean brisket made me sad honestly.  But I do think that if you like your cue leaner, you'll like it here much better than I did.  They are very friendly, & I love warm service, so I would come back to try the St. Louis ribs - which they did say are fattier.

2016-05-17,3.0,"I had high expectations for Smoque after seeing it featured on a number of shows and the great reputation through word of mouth. I certainly do not want to deter you from trying this place out but I was not impressed with the sliced brisket or pulled pork. The meat was on the drier side and sauces were not well balanced, too much smoke and spice and not enough sweet. But BBQ is a lot of personal preference. The sides were smaller than expected as well. The Mac and cheese was tasty but again, small portions. My favorite dish was the BBQ Gumbo, which I think is safe to say consists of the older meat. But it had good flavors especially when mixed with cole slaw and cornbread. The Coca-Cola was also on point. Overall, it's hard to head that way again especially considering how close I am to Green Street Smoked Meats.

2016-05-16,4.0,"This is the best barbecue I've had in Chicago and it's absolutely worth the trek out. The cafeteria style makes it a really fun eating experience and the restaurant itself is simple and wood and nice looking.  I went with a friend and we pretty much gorged ourselves. I really loved the brisket and the pulled pork, particularly the former. The brisket slices were juicy, flavorful, and smoky. The fatty bit at the top is incredible and melts in your mouth like butter. The pulled pork was nice and also very juicy with a great smoky flavor. It was more chopped than pulled, but was still great. I disliked the St Louis ribs because they were too dry (I know they're dry by nature but they were not great and too spicy without there being enough good meaty flavor to interact with the spice).  The cornbread was unimpressive and also very dry; the Mac n cheese was watery and not super cheesy; the bbq beans were also very watery and sour/ vinegary. Beans are usually my favorite thing to get with bbq, but I didn't like these. It's OK though, I don't come for the sides -- I come for the meat and for the fun of eating a ton of meat here. If you are going to get a side though, GET THE COLESLAW. I was shocked at how amazing it was. I don't typically expect coleslaw to be the star of a meal, but this came close. It's delicious and packed with sweet flavor without having that excess of mayonnaise that most slaws have. Another winner was the fries - hand cut, crispy, and greasy in the best way. I was also a big fan of the peach cobbler. It uses canned peaches, which is a little weird, but still very delicious. The crust is super crumbly, buttery, and sugary. I really enjoyed it.  Smoque is a treat in the summer or winter. The smell of the restaurant and the taste of the meats will bring you a joyful experience.

2016-05-11,5.0,"One of the best BBQ places in Chicago, hands down.   The sliced brisket rivals any of the BBQ places that I've eaten at, and I've spent time in both South Carolina and Kansas City.  The smoked chicken has great flavor as well, and begs to be eaten without sauce to experience the full flavor of the pit.  The portion sizes are large, as my wife and I usually get one sandwich and a platter so that we can split the sides. I enjoy the Memphis style BBQ sauce, and don't care much for the Carolina style that they serve with their dishes, but it ultimately comes down to personal preference there. The staff is very friendly and quick to clear tables to keep people rotating through.  The lines are never too bad from my experiences, and it's also BYOB, so a meal like that can't be beat.

2016-05-04,4.0,"Got a pulled pork platter with mac n' cheese and brisket chili, and was able to try a little bit of the brisket while I was there. First off....texture of the pulled pork was actually pretty amazing. Maybe I was lucky, but I got a bite with great crust, moist meat, and the perfect amount of savory fat to balance it all together. They drizzle a bit of their Memphis sauce on top of it but the pork stood on its own. The brisket also had a great smokey flavor, but I think from what I tried anyways their greater ratio of fat/lean meat in the pulled pork put it over texturally. Had a bit of trouble choosing which sides to grab, as with the coleslaw you get your choice of two between Baked beans, fries, mac n'cheese, and brisket chili. The Mac n' cheese was probably my favorite side; the fries were fries(still hot out of the fryer so you can't go wrong with them), and the brisket chili was alright but overall less flavorful than I thought it would be.  The Cole slaw too was actually really good, and if I didn't get it with the platter I would have ordered it on the side; It wasn't mayo-based but vinegar based so it tasted a little lighter than some other slaws, and added some freshness that provided a good balance with the smokey meats. As far as their sauces go, they provide two, a vinegar based Carolina sauce and a thicker Memphis Sauce. The sauces are good...but in all honestly didn't seem to distinguish themselves all too much from other bbq sauces I've had.  Verdict: Good but not mindblowing bbq, and given that it takes an hour for me to get there, not sure how often I would make the trip. Will probs go for their ribs next time, with slaw, mac n'cheese, and baked beans, to see how those hold up.",0.9959,0.801,0.182,0.017,0.6119731800766284

2016-04-28,3.0,"For a place called Smoque, there was no smokey flavor in their brisket. The staff was very nice, the location was clean, and the bathrooms were very clean. The brisket barely had a smoke ring and I'm almost positive that the brisket was cut incorrectly and didn't sit long enough. It tasted more like they boiled a brisket and tossed it into the smoker for 2 hours to give it a little ring. It didn't pass the pull test either.  The coleslaw was good, no complaints here, but I don't think I could eat the Mac and cheese again. It was really gritty by the time I got to the last bites of it, and not in a breadcrumb on top getting to the bottom kind of way.  The chilli is fantastic, though the same problems that came about with the brisket end up in the chilli, lack of smokiness.

I've been to many spots here and Chicago (Q BBQ, Smoke daddy, County BBQ, Green street meats to name a few) and Smoque takes the cake. Their line moves efficiently, and their food comes out without too long of a wait. The two sauces you get with your food were a great contrast to each other, and complemented the food perfectly  Chopped brisket: perfectly tender, and with a great smoky flavor 1/2 chicken: the skin was deliciously seasoned/smoked, and the meat is your regular ole chicken, nothing extravagant but still good. Mac n Cheese: not the best Mac n cheese, but it comes in a small cupcake sized portion - it had a great creamy texture, but not very flavorful Cornbread: again comes in a cupcake size portion, it's flavorful, and at that happy medium of firm, soft, and just flaky enough Coleslaw: I'm not s fan of mayo-slathered slaw, so the slaw here was awesome, it was light, vinegary in flavor, and a well sized portion Pecan bread pudding: this alone is what gives this place 5 stars. It was warm, sweet, crunchy, chewy, soft, gooey, and delicious. The candied walnuts were a great touch. Peach cobbler: some of the best cobbler I've ever had.

Toasted with breadcrumbs completed it. Slaw was a nice addition to the sandwiches.  The employees are friendly and try to be accommodating with how busy it is.

2016-04-10,5.0,"Wow!!! Where do I start? First of all, my first exposure to Smoque BBQ was when my employer hired them to cater our 'indoor' barbeque.   That was the first time I had that scrumptious and tender and juicy Brisket.    OMG!!! Other co workers liked the barbeque chicken and pulled pork but I kept getting more brisket.  Anyone who knows me, knows I am a meat and meat and meat and potato girl.  So I kindof sampled their Mac N Cheese, Cole Slaw (which was more on the vinegar side) and Corn bread.   All sides were good. But I want to mention, my employer paid extra for Smoque to come and cater / serve their meals.  I highly recommend paying the extra money.   They have that process down to a SCIENCE.  Very detailed, clean, organized and they even pack up any leftovers with labels.   How awesome is that? But today, my husband and I finally W`E`N`T to Smoque.   Yes, I was warned that their place is small and to avoid busy meal times.   So, of course, we went around 12:30pm.  Oh well.   But while we were waiting in line to order, a gentleman asked how many in our party.  I'm so glad they did not place that burden on us.  This way, they had an employee looking for seating for any guests who were dining.   And before our number was even called, this gentleman had found a seat for us. Keep in mind, you will get to sit closer to the people next to you.  But I do not think you will be bothered to carry a conversation because all of us were busy eating this awesome barbeque meal. The staff at Smoque was so nice.  Even when I asked for a 'to go' container, the young lady asked me if I wanted a bag.  Very thoughtful.  I also appreciate that they cleaned the table each time before a new guest sat down.    Well, I left there stuffed and I think I am still stuffed hours later.   But by next week, I hope my husband asks me, ""Hey do you want to go to Smoque?""   And before he finishes his question, I will be in the car---waiting in the passenger seat.",0.9968,0.79,0.189,0.021,0.5067370676461584

I don't know about you but I'm REAL picky when it comes to barbecue places. The sauce has to be amazing, the meat has to be a certain way, and the smells have to be delicious. Smoque to-go was my first visit to this restaurant and walking in to pick up our order quickly exceeded one expectation quickly; smells.  Smells: oh man did it exceed expectation. The restaurant is on the smaller side but that just made everything better. The smells of bbq ribs and bbq pork sandwiches filled the air around us. I was automatically interested after opening the door.  Other foods that aren't ribs: after bringing the food home (1 St. Louis full slab with coleslaw, Mac n cheese, and beans) we were dying to dig in. The Mac n cheese was pretty standard but the crunchy top killed it. Don't even get me started on the coleslaw, completely reminded me of my UIUC days at Joes Burgers. The slaw was delicious and not overbearing. The beans were extraordinarily tasty (I wish I had more!!!) and now for the main course review.  Ribs: holy moly these were delicious. When people write reviews saying this was the best bbq place in Chicago for ribs, couldn't agree more! The ribs were well cooked and the meat on them was delicious!!!! There wasn't any fat it was all big juicy meats on the ribs. Incredible, it really was. The sauce BLEW MY MIND!!! they gave us two cups of the sauce and we finished both, craving more. The sauce was so good I could honestly eat it plain which is totally nasty but feels totally right.  Overall, this place exceeded expectations!

We came at a good time because the crowd came more at around 11:30 - many there for take-out rather than eating in.

I had the sliced brisket platter with slaw, Mac and cheese, and cornbread. We both tried everything. The ribs were excellent, as was the brisket. The pulled pork was a little dry for our taste.

Last week after being directed to the best bbq in San Antonio -and confirming its 4.5 star rating on Yelp- I was ashamed to say Smoque does Texas bbq better than Texas, way better. The meats and sauces are amazing, but the selling point for me is the sides. Best beans I've ever had. Great fries. Hearty slaw, etc. And to top it off, Smoque is by far the best in presentation. Bbq places tend to have a hole-in-a-wall appeal and presentation (which I love). Smoque retains that sense of ""grub"" while highlighting the quality of their food with quality presentation.

I'm not a big fan of bbq so I went with him and got simple chicken which was good but I know their highly rated because of their bbq. So I'm basing my rating mainly on my boyfriends experience. He loves the brisket, pulled pork, and the ribs are the best! The ribs are his favorite he could eat all the ribs in the restaurant. He also loves the corn bread, baked beans, and bbq's sauce.

2016-02-21,4.0,"Supposedly this place is consistently swarming with carnivores, so I came here on a Sunday around noon for lunch. There was practically no line and I placed my order right away. I really appreciated the laid back order-at-the-counter-and-wait-until-your-number-is-called arrangement, as well as the family style seating with all the tables close together in a row. This is what I envision when I come to a BBQ joint.  I ordered a full rack of Baby Back ribs and almost all of the savory sides; corn bread, mac and cheese, coleslaw, brisket chili, and french fries. The ribs were very good and just the right consistency--delicate enough to melt in your mouth as you pull away from the bone. They serve the meat dry and give you ample sauce on the side to wet them to your liking; However, I liked the seasoning they used on the bark so much that I didn't dare touch my sauce. I liked the sides in this order: French fries (quality AND quantity, these bad boys have their own special seasoning), mac and cheese (full of cheesy-flavor with bread crumbs sprinkled on top), corn bread (chunks of corn inside but too small a helping to have adequate softness/moisture retention), coleslaw (just okay, the oil & vinegar kind), brisket chili (too watery, bleh).  Overall, great food! I don't live nearby, and there are tons of closer BBQ places, but Smoque hit the spot and I'd gladly take the time to travel back here for some down home cooking.

2016-02-16,4.0,This review is coming from someone who doesn't understand why people obsess over BBQ. So keep that in mind. All the meat I've ever had from here is good. Is it the best thing I've ever had in the entire world? No. But that's how I feel people react to this place and I don't get it. Chicken and shredded not sliced brisket is good stuff. Beans and Mac and cheese is good. Corn bread is not even close to the best I've had and I prefer traditional tailgate coleslaw to their more basic approach.  Parking can suck but it's never a far walk. Just gave to use the side streets.  And that's all I have to say about that.  Jackée,0.7184,0.87,0.089,0.041,0.5772727272727273

It's a bit pricey, but well worth it.  Their brisket is heaven.  My mouth is salivating just thinking of the delicious bark covering the outter edges. And, don't sleep on the mac'N chees side.  I'm convinced they lace it with opiates(kidding), because it's that darned good.  You get 2 sides with a dinner and I always go for 2 mac'N cheeses. The popularity of this place has died down some over the years, which is a good thing.  Used to be a line out the door at all times.  Now, you walk right on in.  If you are planning to eat in tho, they dont have many tables and if crowded, you will sit with strangers - think Amtrak dining car.   Highly recommended.",0.9835,0.761,0.203,0.036,0.49471306471306475

No, I'm not from the South and won't harp on authentic this or non authentic that. I just love meat and BBQ so much that I would go broke going out to eat it all the time. So instead I make the time to make it myself hours at a time in my own smoker. I know how much care and time it takes to do this. It can't be rushed, and mistakes covered with sauce will be wet messy mistakes indeed.  So yeah, Smoque fits the bill. I ordered the brisket with two sides (Mac and Cheese, and fries) and it came with coleslaw. What's nice is that they allow you to add ""tastes"" of the other meats. Perfect for someone like me who just has to try everything. Texas Sausage? Yes. Some of the ribs? Thank you very much.  I can confirm that the meat is done right. They provide sauce on the side and serve the meat dry. It allows me to add sauce to my own taste and judge the meat by its own merit. Which, was very good. Right consistency, which is to say fragile and about to break down from its time in the smoker. Perhaps a tad dry but I understand they have to do it ahead for the volume expected of a restaurant. The sauces also were not overly sugary brown concoctions either. Had some variety and some kick if you wanted as well.  Sides were good, but with a special note on coleslaw that isn't just green mayo mash. Eat up fellow carnivores!",0.9921,0.779,0.172,0.049,0.5748177542621987

Some notable options are getting the cornbread, pecan bread pudding over the peach cobbler, and bbq beans were ok and avoid the coleslaw! Furthermore, I really like the 1/2 pulled pork and 1/2 brisket sandwiches over the baby back ribs because they were moist, had more flavor and were more tender. The ribs were not fall off the bone-some parts wasn't as soft as id like it to be and reminds me of dry-rubbed ribs i can get elsewhere which might be the reason they lack more flavor because you have to apply either the side of Memphis style sauce or Carolina style BBQ sauces they give ya...Happy to have made it here just before 7pm so there was a short line.

2016-02-01,5.0,"I'm naturally pretty skeptical when it comes to BBQ places north of the Mason-Dixon line. More often than not you're paying a ton of money for mediocre food that merely serves as a reminder of what sort of thing you could be eating, if only you weren't in the midwest. So, when friends suggested we go to dinner at Smoque, managed expectations seemed to be appropriate. ...Then we got there, and there was a line out the door, on a day where there was a -10 wind chill. This leaves you with two possible conclusions: In this insane post-iPhone world where people just will wait in line for everything no matter how ridiculous that these were just professional line-waiters, or, the food is truly that legit. Well, turns out the answer was the latter. We waited a good 30-40 minutes to even order, and the place was so jammed that they even had a guy acting as a bit of an air traffic controller to figure out seating for people eating in. It was mind-boggling, but it all made sense as soon as I sat down with my tray. I got a little bit of everything, and it was all incredible. The brisket is something dreams are made of, the pulled pork was bananas, mac and cheese was life changing, the baked beans were insane, the coleslaw was heavenly, really the only thing that was just kinda sorta OK was the cornbread but it's possible that the rest of the stuff was just so great that even good cornbread would just seem alright in comparison.

I would 100% recommend Smoque, and of all the BBQ places that exist in the Midwest Smoque holds its own ground even compared to much of the BBQ I've had in the South. You have to prepare to wait through the line to order for dine-in, and numerous people called in to take their orders to go, which might be the right choice given the small confines of the restaurant. I came with 3 friends, and we waited for about 30 minutes, which wasn't as painful as it sounds as we were inundated with the smell of the delicious food to come. By the time we ordered, we didn't even have to wait at all to score a 4 person table, a big plus as I was afraid we wouldn't have a place in time for our meal.  I ordered the Brisket Platter, and when I asked the cashier if she recommended it chopped or sliced, she told me ""sliced is best if you want it juicier and chopped is best if you like more of the smoky, taste of the more cooked parts of the meat"". She even offered for me to have 1/2 sliced and 1/2 chopped, so I of course chose the variety. The brisket was some of the most delicious I have ever had, and I would definitely recommend both. The two made in house BBQ sauces were fantastic as well (one was served with my friend's chicken and one was a special brisket sauce). I tried a bite of the chicken, and it was extremely flavorful and balanced with its perfect smokey taste.  The Mac 'n Cheese was amazing, and the cornbread was beyond words - the best I have ever had. I feel silly saying that, but I mean it. The best I've ever had.  You cannot go wrong here.

The brisket just absolutely melts in your mouth, easily the best brisket I've had in Chicago. They give you a Carolina style sauce and Memphis style sauce with the brisket. Both were really, really good. Their version of Carolina style isn't as vinegar-y as I've had in the past. Mac n cheese was like a little baked casserole...delicious.

Any of the meats, literally cannot go wrong. My favorite, and this is hard is the Texas Sausage. Not many out of staters understand the taste to get the taste just right - and boy did they! The St. Louis ribs: Meaty and fall off the bone COMPLETLY. Used the spicy st louis sauce..superb. Sliced brisket: delicious as well, charred enough on the outside and little fat as should be. Very tender. Chopped brisket: a little crunch and little tender and more juicy than the sliced. Added spicy st louis sauce.  Pulled pork: equally delicious, and pulled enough to just add sauce and eat. Tender as well. Beans: very sweet!

My bf and I decided that we'd check out Smoque BBQ before I headed back home to New Orleans from my New Year's visit.  I'm a sucker for brisket (fatty, please) so I got the plate with mac & cheese and cornbread and my bf got the pulled pork plate with baked beans and cornbread (bty, it automatically comes with coleslaw). Now, I've had my fair share of brisket and I had a local New Orleans favorite that unfortunately closed due to a family illness but Smoque BBQ ranks right up there with my local favorite. I will say this, being a southern chick, I know good mac & cheese and cornbread when I taste it, and theirs is pretty darn good. We each were given 2 different sauces with our plate and we both preferred the tomato based sauce over the vinegar based sauce. I, of course, didn't finish my plate and amazingly, neither did my bf (what?), which was surprising so I took a few slices of brisket, some pulled pork, 1/2 of my mac & cheese and cornbread on the plane trip back home. My flight was delayed so I'm at Midway sitting at gate 10, concourse B when my stomach growls. I pull out my take out box, open it and pinch off a piece of brisket and as I'm getting ready to put it in my mouth, the guy sitting next to me says ""that smells amazing, did you get that here in the airport and I'm like, no, my bf & I visited Smoque BBQ on N. Pulaski Road earlier today and these are the leftovers that are going home with me"". Needless to say, he looked disappointed that he wasn't going to be able to go get some and I certainly wasn't sharing mine with him.  In my opinion, good bbq should heat up well in the microwave and the taste shouldn't alter at all and Smoque BBQ, you passed the test the following day after I arrived back home in New Orleans.",0.9867,0.835,0.123,0.042,0.4918945089997722

The decor is rustic, to get more seating you may we sitting very close to other people like a community table feel.  They play music in the back ground sounded like jazz music to get you into the BBQ mood.  Now keep in mind, BBQ meats do get pricey so it's a good idea to know what you want to order ahead of time. While you wait in line, you can see what others are eating and you can see all the awards this place has posted on the walls.  For their ribs, they use a Memphis-style dry rub and apple and oak firewood to get that great flavor.  They give you sides of BBQ sauce not overly sweet.   I usually order the following: Just to let you know the ribs are not precut so be prepared with a knife to cut your meat or get down and dirty and tear that meat apart!  It can be messy... -The baby back ribs are fall of the bone ribs with a nice crust so you can eat them dry or dip or pour their BBQ sauce all over it!  -The St Louis ribs is a meatier kind of ribs you can see the smoke ring around it.  Eat it as is with the dry rub or pour on that BBQ sauce. -Their brisket is one of my favorites.  They cook their meeting for 14 hours in the smoker and man it's so moist and tender melts in your mouth, oh wait that's the fat yum!  I get these sliced or you can get them chopped to order.  They put on a light BBQ sauce just for the brisket. They also sell pulled pork, chicken, Texas sausage which I've seen people eat and they said it's very good. I like the fact that you can also order smaller sizes of these meats to your main order or if you can add it to your salad for those who are cutting the carbs. The sides we get are all pre-measured in their own little containers: -Coleslaw (thinly shredded slaw that they use a vinegar not a creamy dressing) it comes with your meal.  I like it, not so much the hubby. -BBQ Beans is very sweet but the beans are cooked well.  I liked it. -Macaroni & Cheese it comes it's own cooked container size topped with bread crumbs.  Both of us like this side I would get it again, if you LOVE mac n cheese then order 2. -Cornbread sweet bread reminds me of Boston Market sweet, it's ok.   -Brisket Chili hubby ordered this, good flavor meaty chili hearty he says.

Yes, it's better than most BBQ places around here. Yes, it's probably the best BBQ place in Chicago. However, Chicago isn't necessarily a BBQ Mecca (see KC, Memphis, Carolina, Alabama, Austin) and a lot of other places in the city are nearly as good as Smoque.  That being said, there is tons to like about Smoque. Every single side dish is amazing - possibly the greatest BBQ sides in Chicago outside of Lillie's Q. Succulent mac 'n cheese, brisket chili is original and delicious, great beans, and a hell of a cornbread. The meat is the star of the show; especially the ribs. Great brisket (both chopped and sliced), amazing links, and an even better rib selection (baby back & St. Louis). Haven't tried pulled pork. Both sauces (Carolina & Memphis) are delightful. Price is decent - what you would expect. BYOB makes it amazing. Location is central for all of Chicago and easy to get to and find parking. The only qualms I have with Smoque are associated with a fairly weak ambience. First off, it's a pain in the ass to find seating and get the order. Often times they are so crowded that I cannot hear my number and the food sits. The sauce serving size is meager and they should (like most other Chicago BBQ joints) absolutely put bottles of sauce on all tables! No reason this place should go cheapskate on the sauce given the juggernaut they are in Chicago. Serving size could be larger on the non-rib end, as well.  Obviously I'll be back to Smoque.

2015-11-24,4.0,"Finally got around to trying Smoque and I'm pretty please with the results, however I do think it's pretty over-hyped. First of all, the prices are great. A huge brisket meal with 2 sides AND cole slaw for about $12? That's awesome. The food was pretty good for the most part. I think some of the issues (such as food being too cold) I had were due in large part because I ordered take out. I have to imagine the food is a bit better if you're sitting down at the restaurant.  The brisket: a little overcooked and not as tender as I would've liked, but they give you plenty of meat and once you add some sauce it's pretty good. I'd probably get something else next time though. The mac n' cheese: OMG, obsessed. The crumble on top is to die for. Smoque's mac n'cheese is a vast improvement over most BBQ places that give you noodles mixed with a yellow substance and it really just tastes like you're eating glue. The baked beans: They were a little too watery for my liking, but the flavor was a perfect mix of sweet and smoky with  a little tang. Well done. The cole slaw: Not a fan at all. It seems much more like an after thought than anything. It was quite bland with the exception of a vinegar taste. It honestly looked as if they cut up some cabbage, put pepper and vinegar on it, and put it in a container. Definitely could be improved. The BBQ sauce: I really enjoyed the Memphis style sauce, though it may have been just a tad spicier than I like my BBQ sauce to be (I much prefer a sweet sauce, and Memphis is typically on the sweeter side, so I was surprised that it wasn't as sweet). However, I wasn't a fan of the Carolina BBQ sauce at all. I like that they were clearly labeled, and even gave some direction for which sauce to put on which meats. They recommended putting the Carolina on the brisket, but I'm glad I just dipped a tiny bit to try it first, because my food would've been ruined had I put all the Carolina sauce on my brisket. Waaaaay too much vinegar for me (I know, that's how Carolina sauce is supposed to be...but still, it wasn't good). Overall, I enjoyed most of the food and would likely go back. I probably won't try the brisket again, but I'd like to try the ribs or pulled pork.",0.9985,0.727,0.244,0.029,0.5985998802036536

My moist tender chicken was covered in a spiced ebony skin. The generous sides are perfect foils to the mains. I adore the crispy fries that come in a brown bag. The slaw is crunchy with the right amount of tang.

2015-10-28,5.0,"Heaven on Earth.  Definitely worth the wait. Three of us got there around 5:45 and the line was to the door already. It moved fairly quickly and pretty soon we were waiting for an open table. They really have this process streamlined as best as they can. After you order your food, one of the employees confirms the number of people in your party and as other people leave, they seat you. At that point they start preparing your order.  About 15 minutes after we got our table, our food was ready. Everything was SO GOOD and you get SO MUCH food. Between the 3 of us we had: 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich order-- 1/2 pulled pork, 1/2 chopped brisket. I wanted to try both and this was the best way to do it. If you think ordering half portions means you'll get less food, you'd be wrong.  Sliced brisket--such good flavor: smoky and tender. Probably liked this version better than the chopped brisket in my sandwich.  Half chicken--This might as well feed 2 people because it was so large 1/4 slab of St Louis Ribs--you can get this as an add on so of course we did. Again, amazing flavor, so tender.  All of our sides came as part of the meals.  Mac and cheese--It looks like a small portion, but it's so rich you'll be glad to not have more because it's tasty so then you'd eat more and be even more full.  Fries--you get a brown paper bag full of them. Is this the ""small"" version when it comes with the meal? I don't know, but you get way more fries than I expected.  Cornbread--Pretty standard, but good Coleslaw--More on the vinegary side than mayo, which I appreciated because it's my preference. Oh and the sauces. I was a big fan of the thicker Memphis Style sauce, but the Carolina style was good if that's your thing.  We pretty much finished everything because we're gluttons and because it was so good it would have been a waste not to. And then they had to roll us out of there. But seriously, I was full until lunch the next day. Next time, I would probably not eat the rolls that come with the sandwiches. They are good enough, but they take up valuable space in your stomach.  Overall, pricing was quite fair, especially when you consider the portions. All of our food plus 2 fountain drinks (and free cup of water) came out to just under $60. We used an a la card so our total bill was even cheaper at $49. We easily found free street parking.

2015-10-12,2.0,"100% Hype and Complete Letdown Quick preface:  Little Miss BBQ in Phoenix, AZ ( yelp.com/biz/little-miss… ) is hands down the best Texas style BBQ outside of Texas and when I moved from Phoenix to Chicago I was deeply missing all the smoky tender meats from that fine establishment.  So you can imagine my excitement when I read in this article ( thrillist.com/eat/nation… ) that Smoque had made the list along with Little Miss BBQ as one of the top 5 best Texas style BBQ outside of Texas.  I went in with some pretty high expectations but unfortunately they were not even close to being met. That being said, let's get down to the review: Memphis style bold BBQ Sauce (2/5) Tasted of generic store brand BBQ sauce and was a bit on the salty side Carolina style vinegar BBQ Sauce (4/5) I'm usually not a fan of vinegar based sauces but this was surprisingly good.  The vinegar wasn't overpowering and it was a very well balanced sauce.  This went really with the pulled pork. Brisket (2/5) Dry, no smoke ring, and lacking in flavor.  How can you serve smoked brisket without a smoke ring?! Without the fatty parts this brisket would be inedible as the texture and dryness of the meat was comparable to that of canned tuna.  Did I also mention that this was completely lacking in flavor?  Easily the biggest disappointment of all the meats. Pulled Pork (3/5) Decently tender and juicy but once again lacking in flavor.  As I mentioned before this went really well with the Carolina style vinegar based sauce.  This was the best of the meats I had there but it was slightly above average pulled pork at best St Louis Style Ribs (2/5) Really good flavor and meat came clean off the bone but despite this, the meat wasn't tender at all.  The crust on the meat was was delicious and smoky but since the quality of the meat wasn't that great I would have to say this was still a bit of a letdown. Mac and Cheese (1/5) I originally ordered a small but was convinced by the cashier to get the large as this side ""stood up above the rest"".  Boy did I make the mistake by listening to her.  In my opinion the properties of quality mac and cheese must include 'ooey and gooey'.  This mac and cheese was goopy and the cheese/sauce had the consistency of creme brulee . Yes, creme brulee.  I love creme brulee but describing mac and cheese as having the consistency of creme brulee is absolutely something you do not want in mac and cheese.  Aside from the baked crust, I could barely taste the cheese flavor and as harsh as this may sound, this was probably some of the worst mac and cheese I've had. Perhaps I just got a bad batch of food or something but I honestly have no idea how Smoque has a 4.5 star rating with over 3000 reviews.  Needless to say, it is pretty unlikely that I ever return.",0.9883,0.789,0.135,0.076,0.49768620268620267

The meat was a bit rough. No bbq sauce on it. It's a dry rub. It wasn't as tender as the baby back ribs. Also, I tried their mac&cheese and cornbread for their sides and it was very tasty.  I went around dinner time 6:00pm on a weekday and was got my food 15 mins later. Fast service. Highly recommended!

Then wait for your food to be delivered straight to your table? No, Smoque won't do that, either. They'll call your number, then if you're inside or outside, you'll have to get up and pick up your own order at the counter. C'mon, Smoque.

Brisket - Definitely not Prime grade brisket ( oh how I miss you Franklin's!). No luscious fat webbing. No pink smoke layer. No excitement.  Sausage - Nothing to write home about. I still have dream's about Franklin's sausage. This was similar to something found in a dog treat. Only awesome items here were the BBQ beans and the mac and cheese. Everything else was a total miss.

That said it's a solid BBQ joint and packed from open to close it seems so perhaps I'm the only one that feels this way. The pulled pork is my go-to and it's very good. The sandwich is HUGE with lots of meat. I shared mine with my son and was stuffed between that and the sides. The french fries are quite amazing, and one order could probably feed three-four people. The slaw seemed less fresh and colorful than I remember, but it's basically free, so I'll give it a pass. Mac and cheese is rather bland, my kids didn't even like it. They've added a patio which helps with seating, but it's still a rather stressful experience even though they do good with crowd control, line and seating. There's inevitably someone who's new to the place, trying to jockey for a table and has to be scolded.

THE GOOD: - The pulled pork was tender and juicy, and tasted phenomenal on the sandwich. There were several sauce options, so naturally, I poured all of them on my sandwich.  - The coleslaw wasn't too mayo-y, and added a really nice and refreshing component to the meal - The mac and cheese was truly out of this world. Smooth and creamy, not too salty, jam-packed with flavor -  THE BREAD PUDDING OH MY GOD OH  MY GOD. I wouldn't say that this is a traditional bread pudding - because it's not - and so it cannot be directly compared with those fresh from the South, but that's what makes this so amazing. It tastes like a pecan pie with a bourbon kick, with the soft and smooth texture of a bread pudding on the inside, with a pie-like textured crust. Different, but in a great way! MEH: - The chicken was fine. Nothing special. Kind of plain - the flavor didn't seep into the middle.  - The corn bread was not sweet or spicy enough. It was very bland and a waste of calories.

2015-07-09,4.0,"My friend and I decided to take a spontaneous trip to Smoque BBQ which has been on our list since we moved here. On a late Friday night around 9, we walked in to a busy, homey joint eager for barbecue. We scanned the menu and walked straight to the counter to order. I got 1/4 rack of St. Louis ribs with cole slaw and Mac n cheese (felt like the perfect portion to me) and she got a 1/3 rack of Baby Back ribs with fries and Mac n cheese (hers came with cole slaw).  As we settled down to the picnic like tables, we realized the cramped venue was BYOB. People brought in their own beer and even hard liquor and everyone looked very cheery and comfortable! Our food came shortly after and we of course had to take a first bite of the Mac n cheese - holy cheese gods! The flavors and creaminess of this BBQ side staple were absolutely heavenly and though the silver tin it came in was tiny, I was so excited to gobble down the whole thing. But, I have this thing where I like to save the best for last so I moved on to try the cole slaw. The cole slaw was a downer, not a lot of wetness and too peppery for me. Alas! But the crunchiness of the cabbage was a good complement to everything else. My friend's fries came in a huge portion. They were seasoned well, but felt too heavy for a bbq side in my opinion. Next, the ribs! Man oh man, it's been so long since I've had ribs and they were phenomenal. I cleaned each rib to the bone. Each rib was so meaty and flavorful and the 1/4 rack was perfect! My friends 1/2 baby rack ribs were much smaller (not sure the appeal of baby back over St. Louis?). The ribs came with a small cup of the St. Louis sauce and I wasn't a fan of this sauce actually. It was more tangy than I would prefer. If I were to compare Q BBQ with Smoque, Q would definitely win the sauce category with their variety and unlimited quantities. Since I had brisket at Q, I can't compare the meats, but both had me blown away!  After some time, I was ready to finish up my macaroni. I was devastated to find that it got cold and the creaminess kind of curdled. TIP: eat yo mac n cheese right away Because Smoque BBQ is rather far away, I see myself going to Q BBQ over Smoque.

2015-07-08,5.0,"There isn't much that I could say in my review that differs from the other 3,000 reviews haven't covered, but I am just going to reiterate the fact that the baby back ribs are f***ing amazing.   A couple days prior to my visit at Smoque my fiance had found out that I never eaten any ribs...ever!  I know, okay, it's very strange that I've lived in one of the greatest cities for food (BBQ especially) and have never eaten ribs.  It's not like I had some outrageous grudge against them - they've just eluded me.  But no longer!  I went to Smoque with my fiance and we split a full slab of those baby back, baby back, baby back ribs and they could not have been any better!  If you haven't had the pleasure of trying ribs before then THIS is the one and only place that should be your introduction to the phenom that is a baby back rib.  Even if you have eaten ribs before then you still need to go to Smoque.  It was televised on the Food Network for a reason guys!  The ribs really are that good!  The meat is some of the most tender I've tasted in a long time and you can rip it off the bone so easily.  Indulge your inner carnivore!  Besides the tenderness of the meat, the ribs also have a smoky-sweet flavor that couldn't possibly get any tastier.  Sure, the ribs are somewhat expensive, especially if you order a full slab instead of a half slab, but don't use that as an excuse not to get any.  You're not going to be eating ribs every week so you can afford a splurge on some noteworthy ribs once in a while.  They are worth every dollar you spend on them, I guarantee that! The ribs do come with two sides so we ordered the BBQ beans and the cornbread.  I will say that the sides are not the best I've had and in fact the cornbread seemed a little stale, but regardless of this the sides were not bad by any mean.  To put it simply, they just were not my favorite.  What the sides lacked, though, the meat made up for.  I'm serious - the ribs were glorious.  That is what you're going there for anyways.   Just keep in mind that your stomach is going to have to rumble for about a half an hour to an hour because of the long line.  Yes, I know that long lines are quite annoying to deal with but take it as an indication of how good the meat is there.  Luckily for you, Smoque is a BYOB so you can bring a beer for that long wait you will surely have to endure.   Also, a sidenote, just know what you want to order way before you get to the counter because it will make the process much quicker for you and for everyone else that also has to wait in line.  It's just a courtesy thing.  I'm sure that the employees will appreciate that more as well!  Keep in mind that they are extremely swamped for the entire time that they are working; despite this they are still extremely friendly! Oh!  Oh!  One last tip - it says that Smoque closes at 9 pm, but they actually lock their doors around 8:45 pm so that they don't have a line out the door at 9 pm.  If you can get there earlier than that is better - you don't want to run the risk of not getting in!  They do close it a little earlier because it takes a while to actually cook the meat.   Again, this is definitely the go-to place for all your rib first-timers like myself!  Who am I kidding though?  This is a go-to place for anyone that loves BBQ!",0.9968,0.808,0.142,0.049,0.4938192818110851

2015-07-06,4.0,"I really do enjoy this place. I think it a really good deal for some quick tasty barbecue. I must say that it is not my favorite BBQ spot but it is definitely close to it. Here's what I ordered last time I was there: // St. Louis Full Rack - $20.95 - Theses ribs are so tasty. They have a pretty decent amount of meat on them. They are very soft and tender. It is REALLY hard for me to decide which one I prefer: St Louis or Baby back ribs. The baby back ribs are smaller and more curved. They are a bit sweeter. But the St Louis are more straight on the bone and have a little bit more meat. Not as sweet. I would recommend you get some with a friend and split the two.  // Added Sliced Brisket - $5 - This brisket was pretty good but it was a little bit dry. Then there was a time I went back to smoque and the brisket was delicious. So I think it depends on the day, so I would maybe steer you away from getting this due to its inconsistency.

2015-07-05,5.0,I rarely almost never give a 5 so you have to know this place was good.  After the wait it's all downhill.  Yes I arrived and the line was out the door on an 85 degree day.   The service was good.  The atmosphere is casual barbecue like.  And the food is off the chain good.  The hot food is hot and the cool/cold food is cool/cold.  The cole slaw has a light non mayonnaise dressing so that you can actually taste the slaw.  The ribs come bare and piping hot cooked to perfection with a side of barbecue sauce for those who needs.  I ate them both ways and the ribs were good.  They had a slight smoked flavor but they were tender and flavorful without overpowering the meet. I can't wait to get back to this restaurant and I am not even a barbecue person.  This place was great.  And I say that even after the wait and driving to get to this spot.  Worth it all.,0.9692,0.841,0.159,0.0,0.5395833333333334

Free btw Scene:  can get crowded with lines looped through the establishment. Place can accommodate enough but its not the biggest place. Has a bbq line order feel with more lively vibe if that makes sense. Casual atmosphere overall. Service: Nice enough for a place like this. Someone leads you to the order line, gives you a ticket, you order, once you are served they show you your seat to eat. Simple enough but could imagine witha large party this being mildly troubling oh well. Everyone one is nice. No issues Food: I order the bean spicy chili, mac n cheese, and chicken BBQ. Portion size are a lil on the small side for the side dishes wish is a let down but the taste makes up for it. Everything is fresh, hot, and packs great taste. I'd recommend each dish I mentioned.

I had the sliced Brisket platter with two sides, Mac and Cheese and Fries. The lady at the counter said those were the two most popular. I also had the bread pudding. The Brisket was divine. It was good with the thinner of the two BBQ sauces. Although, mind not to use too much. The meat needs to carry the flavor. The Mac and cheese was really good with a nice crust on top. The fries were not bad. Perhaps because I had so much food they didn't stand out. The slaw was good, but I could eat much of it because I wanted to save room for the Bread Pudding. It was more bread than pudding, but it was incredible! This is a must try.  They are strictly BYOB. Something I haven't seen before, being from California. I don't think you can do that there.

2015-06-17,5.0,"I have been going here for years, and I'm happy to say I think Smoque has managed to get even better recently. If you're reading Yelp and trying to evaluate whether it's worth the trip, pay attention to the outstanding 4.5 star average after nearly 3,000 reviews, which tells you far more than the handful of mediocre-to-negative reviews you can find here. No restaurant has 100% perfect consistency, and Smoque is no exception, but their range is from mind-blowing to, on their worst days, simply really good, and my last several trips were all in the former category. Have I just been getting lucky lately? I don't think so; I think their consistency is improving. For those that are giving sub-par reviews here, especially if they are saying the brisket wasn't juicy, I can only say you're depriving yourself if you don't give Smoque another chance. Other reasons I say Smoque is getting even better: the Peach Cobbler, previously not sweet enough, changed for the better about a year ago. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a fan of overly sweet desserts, but the cobbler did not have enough sugar to feel like a dessert; they've obviously changed the recipe slightly and it is sweeter, but balanced well without sacrificing its complexity. But perhaps the most important recent improvement at Smoque (besides greater consistency on the meat) is the addition of a second, thicker and tangier sauce, so that now you get two generous tubs of additional sauce standard with each order. Their original thinner, more vinegary, and peppery sauce is still my favorite (I'm thankful they didn't mess with it!), but it's a near toss-up, and I love having both choices and just more sauce overall. Full disclosure: I'm not an experienced ribs eater in general and therefore have little to compare theirs to. The star of the menu for me is their superbly tender, nicely seared, and mouthwatering brisket, which comes in either sliced or chopped form (don't ask me why, but I prefer sliced). Other protein choices: sausage is terrific, and high marks for the pulled pork and chicken, though I have less experience with those. The sides are mostly very good (mac & cheese, brisket chili, beans are my favorites, and the slaw has a nice light vinegar, not cream, base, perfect in the context of an otherwise heavy meal). Fries are excellent and plentiful, though personally I tend to avoid ordering them to avoid additional damage to the arteries (though I always secretly hope someone else in my party orders them so I can steal a few). Not many dessert choices, but besides cobbler, there's a great bread pudding with pecans and caramel sauce that has a great texture and depth of flavor. Some of the less stellar reviews for Smoque are doubtless due to some people expecting something different, especially regarding atmosphere, so here are a few things to know when planning a trip: 1. It's BYOB. 2. The menu is not huge: beef, pork, chicken, sausage, ribs, and a few sides. They focus on doing a few things very well and efficiently. 3. This place does NOT have ""fun"" kitchy country-themed decor, nor a modern hipster vibe. The seating area and general atmosphere is clean, simple, and no-nonsense with simple wooden tables and chairs. It's about the meat here, not distracting decor. 4. The seating area is small, especially given the place's popularity at peak times. Come and sit, but don't expect this will be a place you should (or will want to) hang for an hour or more. Great for lunch or a stop for dinner on the way to something else, but you won't want to ""make an evening of it"" here. 5. I saw at least one complaint about this in the reviews here and yes it's true... you are not automatically given glasses of water when you sit down... because they do not have full table service (you aren't obligated to leave a tip, therefore). You can get water yourself from the soda machine, though. Is this really a problem? 6. Lines at peak times easily go out the door, though I'm generally impressed with how efficiently they move people through given how busy they are. Both the kitchen and front-of-house staff have got a streamlined system in place, but without it feeling rude or like you're being hurried out the door. 7. Some people have complained about parking, and it's true that at peak times you may have to search on one of the residential blocks to park, but honestly, all of Lincoln Park, Lakeview and many other neighborhoods in Chicago have FAR worse parking situations. I can only assume those complaining about parking here are coming from the suburbs (Smoque is right off the I-90/94 Irving Park exit and a lot of suburbanites stop by on the way to Cubs games). If you actually live in the city, you'll probably think the parking is easy, not to mention completely free--not a parking meter in sight.",0.9992,0.736,0.197,0.067,0.552013888888889

I had to wait about 10 minutes to order and was quickly seated.  The staff does a nice job of finding a spot for you to sit, letting you know when you're number is called, and clearing trash away for the next guests.  The food was the real highlight though. I opted for the chopped brisket plate with a choice of 2 sides and slaw for ~$14. The portion of meat was substantial and I had plenty to take home. The meat is definitely the center piece at Smoque, with all meats served with two sauces on the side.  Meats are paired with specific sauces that complement the cuts and flavorings of the dish and I enjoyed the contrast of the two sauces that came with my meal - one was a thick and creamy mesquite sauce and the other was a brisket-specific, vinegar based sauce. Both were tasty! I hoped the brisket would compete with the likes of some of the Austin BBQ I've tried, but it didn't quite get there. A pretty solid Chicago alternative, but I've still gotta make the trek to ATX the best of brisket country. Lots of sides to choose from but I went with the mac & cheese and the fries. The mac & cheese was decadent, with just the right amount of cheese flavor.  The small portion left me wanting more, and I later saw other customers choose mac & cheese for both of their sides to make up for it (what a great idea!).  The fries were served hot and fresh in a small brown paper bag and were plenty to share with a friend.  Portion-wise, the fries were the better deal.  The place is BYOB (except for the patio, which is a bummer) & totally surprised me! They would still have quite the crowd without the added bonus of bringing your own booze, but I happily spent all the extra dough I saved on treating myself to a hot peach cobbler.

The sauces were amazing, the Memphis in particlular was my favorite. Fries are good, cornbread good, however, a sandwich and 2 sides, you are looking at spending $14. The second time I went I ordered the same thing. I'd say this time it tasted overcooked and the meat felt lighter than even the soft bun it came on. It was still good, but this portion had a lot of fat, and was just too tender.  The staff here is nice, but the lines are long.

I ran in and picked up a 6 pack of beer and a nice Mexican guy came up to me and asked me if he could buy it for me...after this moral dilemma, we were on our way to Smoque. So excited. So very very hungry.  We got here on a weeknight a little after 6pm and were prepared to wait in line until we had experienced many emotions ranging from excitement, to indifference, to frustration, to near starvation, to murderous rage, satisfaction, forgiveness, and everything in between, but we only had to wait a whopping 5 minutes before placing our order. I love that the menu is written on a chalkboard so you can decide what you want while you wait in line. We both got the brisket platter with the BBQ beans, fries,  and mac n' cheese. Both of our meals came with a side of cole slaw.  Can I just talk about the mac n' cheese for a sec, because that mac n' cheese is so damn good I just want to roll around naked in it and now they offer a large size which makes me so happy deep down inside my soul. We sat and proceeded to devour our meal like rabid hyenas. I couldn't finish my platter so my husband took over. He had a hard time finishing as well. The brisket was so tender, so juicy, so succulent, so sexy! We sat there drinking the last of our beer while he stood, raised his beer and declared Smoque, the best brisket in Chicago. I stood and concurred. Everyone cheered and clapped. In one swift movement, he swooped me up into his arms and  we exited and walked down Pulaski with BBQ sauce on our faces.  The wait time totally depends. Sometimes we've gone there and waited only 5 minutes. Sometimes we've waited 20 and it can feel like a mosh pit in there and everywhere you stand, you're always in someone else's way. They seem to have their own system down to make the line move as fast and smoothly as possible and it appears to be working well for them.

2015-05-14,5.0,"4 words...The Best Brisket Ever.  I think all the 5 star cazillion reviews here are a testament to how popular, authentic & delicious Smoque BBQ is, so I will try to keep this simple.  I have been here twice.  This place is small, and with its growing fan base I imagine at some point they will relocate to a larger space.  They have limited parking behind the restaurant and luckily we found a spot! The best brisket I have had anywhere period.  Sliced or chopped, it has the right amount of smokiness, fat, and is the most tender brisket I have ever had.  Yes, it does melt in your mouth and leave you wanting more.  First time here came with a group of 7 and we must have been very lucky arriving on a weekend around 5pm with a short line.  Line was pretty fast paced and yes you do have to scope out a table when walking in, however I was really impressed with the staff assisting us in landing a table & making sure we were taken care of.  This place gets busy, busy, busy...you come, you stuff your face and you leave.  If you think Q's has great brisket, try it here. Everyone tried the brisket, pulled pork, baby backs, St. Louis ribs, chicken, mac & cheese and cornbread for sides.  We did not try the Texas sausage. You can also 'add a taste' for $4-$6.00 which is great for sampling.  Chicken was juicy and moist, DELISH - Brisket came in as the winner, runner up's:  pulled pork & St. Louis ribs.  Although these were not fall of the bone ribs, they were tasty & meaty, but I wanted them to be more tender.  The spice rub is not overpowering, the meat is not 'overly smoky'.  Love the rub and you could go without any sauce.  Pulled pork was tender & tasty.  Sides were great as well, but you come here for the BBQ. Sauces?  not my favorite, too sweet for my taste, I prefer more vinegar.  We asked about the different sauces they had and someone in the kitchen mentioned they use Coca Cola.  I could actually taste it in the sauce.  May contribute to why the sauce is on the sweeter side.  Either way, the BBQ here is one of the best in Chicago, these guys know BBQ.  It's worth the trip.",0.9892,0.835,0.134,0.031,0.6037176274018381

2015-05-12,5.0,"In our house, all you have to do is say, ""How about Smoque?"" and we are walking to the car. We love this place.  I know a lot of BBQ fans are all about the pork, but I am a beef girl. I love the brisket at Smoque--beautiful dark edges, pink smoke line, and a tender, melt-in-your mouth center that is soooo good. Every time I order a sandwich I take off one slice of brisket so I can eat it all by itself last, so that taste will linger long after I am done eating. I can't rate sauce on my brisket because I take it plain. As I said, I am a beef girl.  Sides are good, but remember the meat is the star. The cole slaw is dressed with a vinaigrette and is a light counterpoint to the rich smoky meat. The mac and cheese I wish came double sized--it is really good, a little smoky, and made with real cheese. The baked beans are a little too sweet for my taste, but my husband likes them because they are very smoky. We both love the peach cobbler. It has an interesting smoky taste as well, different from an oven baked version. It does make me wish they had ice cream in the menu, so i could put some on top. Now about the pork. The pulled pork is tasty and has a nice caramelized edge which is mixed in with the pulled meat. The sauces are more vinegary than sweet and tomatoey, which is how I like them. I usually don't eat the sweet thick sauces most places serve, but I will have the sharper sauces at Smoque. As for ribs, I prefer the St. Louis ribs because I think that cut has more flavor. These are not parboiled, fall off the bone ribs. These are smoked, gotta-tug-a-little ribs with a good dry rub and not too sweet. Good stuff, but not the sweet saucy stuff served at other places. Chicken is good, not dry, but I prefer beef and pork for BBQ. Parking can be tight on the street, but it's free. We often do take out because the place is crowded most of the time.

I do my own smoking at home and I use very little smoke. I felt this was just as smokey as mine. You do taste the smoke but it's certainly not overwhelming. The sides were good, but nothing special.

The baby back ribs were dry rubbed and I did not enjoy it as much as Pappy's in St. Louis or Phil's in San Diego, CA. But my friend, who is an expert in ribs and he loves dry rubbed, loved the ribs here. The meat is good but the meat didn't fall off as easily and not as tender. You do get to dip into different sauces that are available and each one has a subtle difference. The sides aren't unique and nothing stood out.  The beef briskets were super tender and just melts in your mouth. I think that was my favorite part of the meal. The pulled pork was seasoned pretty well, but it's nothing amazing.

The only complaint I will make is not about the food or experience, but the parking. Since it is in a neighborhood the parking is mostly residential and difficult to find. However, they do provide a map that shows where available parking is. My best suggestion is to take to train and save yourself the hassle. My wife and I ordered the brisket, pulled pork, and we added a 1/4 rack of ribs for around six dollars. The service was relatively quick for a place that was without an open seat. The brisket was very moist and had extremely good flavor. The pulled pork was equally good and the cooks definitely make sure to let the meat stay the focus point of the meal. The ribs were fall off the bone delectable! The sauces were not very special but we're not necessary due to how well the meat was done. The sides were exceptional especially the baked beans.

2015-02-01,4.0,"Well, this place is clearly not a secret. At 5:30 pm on a Saturday night there was a line to the door waiting to order. That gives you time to peruse the big menu board: all the usual suspects, essentially. We were patient and finally made it to the front; meanwhile, an alert young man (the host, basically) was darting around determining the number of people in everyone's party and figuring out where they'd fit based on table availability. That's one game of Tetris I wouldn't care to play, and I'm sure at some point it involves a bit of ""eat and get out"" prodding.  Actually it didn't take us long to eat because you want to scarf down these goodies. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with one side (mac and cheese) and a ""taste"" of Texas sausage, plus the complimentary cole slaw. The juicy, succulent pork arrived atop a forgettable soft roll, with a choice of Memphis (sweet) or Carolina (vinegar) sauces in small cups.  The mac and cheese was tasty but lost warmth very quickly, clotting into an unattractive clump (the warming trays where everything is arranged must not be keeping up). The side of cole slaw was an unexpected delight: a sprightly but not overly punchy vinaigrette bathed the strands of cabbage and onions.  The one disappointment was the sausage: a thick, tough casing held a disappointingly mild meat with a really bland texture. This ""taste"" was a waste of $4, unfortunately.  This is not particularly cheap BBQ, but it is decent-sized portions. My friend got the platter (two sides, one meat -- in her case, brisket, beans and fries) and it was definitely plenty for two meals, unless you are a very hearty eater.  Lots of street parking up the block with no meters! That's something nice in Chicago...

The rub on the ribs was lacking in flavor and could have used a bit more salt.  Also, the smoke flavor on the ribs and brisket was lacking this could be that they are cooking the ribs at a higher temp.  I can usually crush a half slab of ribs pretty easily, but I could only eat half of the half slab.   For the sides, I have one word to describe them, Vinegar.  The slaw you get is like a carolina style with no sweetness at all.  I am a huge fan of slaw, but I could not eat this at all.  The bbq sauces are very runny and lacking in much flavor.  The beans were decent, but could have used a bit more sweetness.  The fries were really tasty.  We also ordered a  bread pudding desert, but were disappointed with that as well.

Food wise, I ordered the chopped brisket platter with the Mac and cheese and baked beans for my sides. Mac and cheese, amazing! Loved the toasted bread crumbs on top and it was the perfect balance of creamy cheese with noodles. From reviews I knew their baked beans were cooked in the smoker and I enjoyed the smokey flavor the beans had. The slaw was good. I usually prefer a creamy slaw but the vinegar based slaw was a perfect compliment to the meal. The chopped brisket was great.

As a precaution, I always call ahead to see if the restaurant can offer gluten free options and if the kitchen is familiar. After sitting on hold for a bit (you could tell they were busy) the women on the phone was pleasant and not flustered by my questions at all. Lucky for me! All of their meats and sauces are gluten free, cole slaw, beans, fries! They've dedicated their fryer to their home cut fries only! If you have gluten issues, you know this is a bonus.. While we waited in line (it was a long line but moved pretty fast and was a regular wait for a weekend at a Chicago restaurant) we had a chance to speak with the older gentleman (owner's father?) and followed up on the gluten question. He told us to make sure to tell the cashier when ordering food and the kitchen staff would be sure to change gloves and use clean utensils when plating my food. He then walked up to the cashier when we got to the front of the line to ensure I was taken care of.  We asked him about the brisket vs. chopped, he explained the difference so we could decide based on what we liked. When our food arrived, he brought over a sample of the chopped brisket (we ordered a ""taste"" of the regular brisket) so we could try them both. I could go on and on, it was just a great overall experience.  Oh and the food was really great! Nice heat on the spicy sauce, the meat was tender and juicy, not dry at all. Cole slaw was nice and light, not a mayo based slaw and of course the fries, so good. Make sure you're ok with communal tables as there were only a handful of ""two tops"" and know that you might stand in line for 20 minutes or so but trust me, it's totally worth the wait.",0.9982,0.767,0.229,0.004,0.6173076923076924

The food stayed very warm until it was ready to serve about 2 hours later.  Don't throw away the containers though.  They charge an arm and a leg for them.  Eating this food made me go out and get my husband a smoker for his birthday last month.  I'm hoping he can replicate  some of the flavors of this place.",0.9957,0.786,0.205,0.01,0.5293732782369145

So I cross checked the Flavortown recs against 2800 glowing Yelp reviews...and Smoque seemed like a clear choice for lunch.  Just a heads up for newbies like us -- you have to order *then* you get a seat.  They keep it moving in here and it was basically PACKED at 11:15 when we arrived. Here is what we ordered: Brisket platter (chopped, no bun) with fries and smoked baked beans 1/2 Chicken Platter with mac & cheese, brisket chili, slaw x2 (stolen from hubs) Added a ""taste"" of St. Louis ribs for $6 Total for tons of food + 2 sodas = $37.67  The star of the show at Smoque had to be the baked beans.  They actually put these beans in the smoker, and you can totally taste it.  However, should I return to a BBQ joint for the baked beans alone?  Hmmmm... The mac & cheese was good -- there was just not a whole lot of it.  (Spoken like a true carb addict and mac and cheese lover, I know.)  It is baked with a crumb top -- served in its own disposable foil ramekin.  Tasty.  Especially with a little hot BBQ sauce added.  Yum.  Chicken (white meat) was remarkably not dried out, but not super juicy either -- Hubs said the dark meat was better.  Ribs were not fall-off-the-bone tender, but had a good taste for a dry rub.  Didn't really even need sauce for these. The down sides for me: first off -- the slaw.  It was simple -- just big long chunks of grated green cabbage and grated red onion...but that's it.  Luckily I could navigate around the chunks of onion (so my husband could bear to spend the rest of the day with me) and the dressing they used actually ended up saving the day...otherwise this would have been a total miss in my opinion.   Secondly, I wanted the brisket chili to be so.much.more. than it was.  The hub's pulled brisket was tasty, so I hoped the chili would be too.  Sad Panda. Let me say this -- if the hubs was writing this review, it would have been given 10+ stars.  He LOVED this place.  I *liked* it  and can see going back to try some other offerings.  Perhaps the hype and my expectations were too high... or I just regret not getting the Bread Pudding with Bourbon sauce.  Either way, we may give it another shot in the future -- but there are just SO many options in Chicago.",0.9808,0.86,0.1,0.039,0.489349962207105

You could see a good smoke ring and the spices formed a really nice crust on the outside. Juicy, tender and flavorful. Mac n cheese wasn't very special. Good but not life changing. Cole slaw was really good though. Seemed to have less mayo than normal and more of a vinegary tang.  Very lively and energetic atmosphere.

The only con besides the fact that they don't deliver was the saddest excuse for sweet tea I've had since the one time McDonalds accidentally gave me water. There was no sugar to fix it, just splenda. I wouldn't knock off a star for something like that, but I'd suggest bringing a packet or two of honey if you're a tea person.

Next up ribs.  St. Louis style. Good taste,  good smoke ring.  Just a little tough to get from the bone.  Might have came off the smoke to early.   Sausage was good but it's shipped from Texas not made in house.

Lastly the sauce.  They have two both were good.  I actaully enjoyed the vinegar based sauce. Which is not the norm for me.

2014-10-27,3.0,"We went to Smoque on a Saturday night for dinner with KT and BS.  The place was very busy is not really set up to handle their fame.  Their system works well in that a host gets your order number and when a table comes available he seats you and puts your order in.  This works, but in the meantime you really have no place to wait.  You end up standing in awkward places between tables and in what aisles there are.  We did have a fairly long wait, although it may have just seemed that way.  I think I would try another night of the week, but who knows, it may be the same. To sample, I ordered a chopped brisket sandwich and for Ms T I ordered pulled pork.  I also got a half slab of back ribs and some slaw.  KT and BS had a rack of ribs with mac and cheese and slaw. The ribs were probably 3-1/2 stars.  Pretty good flavor and a nice rub.  They were not intensely smoky although they are very dark.  This is how dark my ribs at home looked when I did not realize how hot my smoker was running.  I have since fixed that problem.  I suspect they are smoking all of their meat too hot because it is all really black but not exceptionally smoky.  The ribs on this occasion also were a little overdone.  You can see a lot of white bone in the photos that you should not see.  I'm sure there is day to day and rack to rack variability but this kept my appraisal short of four stars or better.  Certainly they are worth trying again. I ordered chopped brisket in self-defense.  Lately when ordering brisket outside of Texas, it has been underdone and you can't eat it on a sandwich without pulling it all off with the first bite.  So chopped was my choice to pre-empt this experience.  I appreciate that they offer this choice.  I suspect they provide the chopped option as a way to use the ends and pieces that don't make nice slices.  That is not a bad thing, you get a lot of outside meat and consequently a lot of smoke and bark flavor.  This was a good sandwich, much larger than I wanted.  Because the bun is too large and bready, I just ate unsauced meat off the bun.  Ms T had pulled pork on her sandwich.  She prefers to eat her barbecue with sauce.  Simply put, you do not want to eat Smoque's sauce.  Neither the spicy nor the mild were worth bothering with.  So she did not enjoy eating the pork.  She felt it was not very smoky and without sauce, well..... live by the sauce, die by the sauce.   KT and BS were given a free sample of both sliced and chopped brisket because the nice guy preparing their order thought they should have some with their rack.  He unfortunately put sauce on the sliced portion, so it was hard for me to really evaluate the sliced brisket for flavor.  It was moist, good bark, not as smoky as it looks.  I would say above average for the Midwest.  Just don't let them sauce anything for you, but that is my policy anyway, regardless of the place and the sauce. The sausage was OK.  It was almost more like a Polish sausage than what I associate with barbecue.  It had more garlic, was denser in texture and was not smoked a lot.  I can't help but compare it to what I have had in Texas. Sides were indifferent.  We did not touch the slaw due to the significant dose of red onion.  We would not have ordered it if we had known.  I am the only one who liked the baked, thick style mac and cheese.  I prefer this to the Kraft Velveeta kind.  This was made with actual cheese, so consequently it was a little grainy.  That happens.  I also liked the corn bread.  It was pretty sweet with some sweet corn kernals. All in all I am having a difficult time rating Smoque.  It is definitely a ""thing"" and overrated by barbecue starved Chicagoans, but that does not make it bad.  Ms T would not return while I would, but hopefully on a night with no significant wait.  I would try ribs again and see if over cooking is systematic.  I would order chopped brisket as a platter.  I don't know what sides I would get.  It breaks my heart to not be able to get onion free slaw.  OK, I made up my mind, the slaw tipped the balance to three stars.  I really would go 3-1/2 if I could.",0.9979,0.788,0.152,0.06,0.5339779064779065

2014-10-20,4.0,"Lets get right down to the food. The ribs are really good. They don't look that pretty but their rub has really good flavor. I don't know that I detected a really good smoke flavor but they tasted great and were tender and the meat easily released from the bone. Delicious, I think the best ribs I've had in Chicago of the 4 or so BBQ joints I've tried. My bf also got a side of their Texas sausage. I had a bite, garlic-y and delicious. I would happily eat their sausage as a meal. I don't know how authentic it was compared to Texas sausage, I suspect not much, but still very good. Their staff is also extremely friendly. My bf and I were standing in front of the pick up counter and the cook asked us if we were the order # he was working on, we were indeed. He was surprised we did not order any brisket, he said he would give us some for free to try, which ended up being an entire tray of both their chopped and sliced brisket with sauce, completely free. That's what I call service. The brisket was really good, tender and flavorful.  Regulars obviously know how the ordering process works here. For the newbies, here's the deal: You line up to order for dine in, staff ask you how many are in your party and say they will seat you once they are ready with a table. After you order this same staff member will ask you for your order # so he knows what food goes with who. They do not fire your food until their is a table ready for you. It's a small, cramped place but despite it being packed with not a ton of space, the staff is on top of everything and extremely nice. When there are tables clearing out and being cleaned up, they tell the cooks what order #s to fire so you have a table when your food is ready. That does mean that many people who have already ordered and are waiting in a cramped place will have their food on hold until there is a table ready for them. This could make for very long wait times. We got there ""just in time"" on a Saturday night and still had to wait. I wouldn't be surprised if the others waiting while we were eating waited for an hour or more. The place was hoppin.  Where they fall short? Their sides and sauces. I didn't like either their regular or spicy sauce very much, and in fact really actually disliked their regular sauce. Their spicy was better on the ribs and the Texas sausage, but not on its own. I would have liked it a bit more sweet. Because of their sauce I would never order their brisket. It was good and tender like I said, but its just sauced meat either on a tray or on a bun. If their sauce was better, I'd be more into it. Their cornbread and mac n cheese, the 2 sides I got with our full slab, are after thoughts. The cornbread is a bit dry and could be more flavorful. The mac n cheese is typical mealy, powdery type mac n cheese that you get at basically every restaurant in America because no one knows how to make creamy mac n cheese apparently. It was better with some salt but nothing to talk about. Their fries are the same kinda soggy fries you can get at any hot dog or italian beef joint in Chicago. DESPITE their sides and sauces not being stellar, their ribs were so good that I can overlook the sides and sauces.

2014-10-20,3.0,"Nothing says promising quite like a large framed picture of Guy Fieri on the wall (....sike). Luckily what Smoque does get right is their meats. The brisket is phenomenal, maybe even the best sliced brisket I've ever had. It was incredibly tender, almost feeling unnaturally soft as I poked my fork into it. The ribs probably appeal most to those that don't eat their barbecue with a preference. I'm no barbecue connoisseur, but cooking the meat with a dry rub seems to make the meat a little tougher than what I'm used to down in Southern California. It still packs in a lot of flavor, but I prefer my ribs a little more tender. The sides are honestly mediocre to ""pretty good"" at best. The mac and cheese/the fries that I stole from a buddy were probably the top contenders. The brisket chili and coleslaw were kind of a letdown; the coleslaw being almost bland and the brisket chili not bringing anything new to the table.

In other words, the staff obviously did not have their stuff together.  I would hate to come when it is crowded.   My friend ordered a 1/2 brisket sandwich, chopped, and I ordered a 1/2 brisket sandwich sliced.  The bread felt cheap, like the Hawaiian buns you buy at the jewel.  While the traditional BBQ sauce was delicious, the vinegar sauce had a terrible aftertaste; I love Carolina BBQ, so I love vinegar sauce.  The brisket was dry as a bone, even after I dumped BBQ sauce on it, and the rub did not have much of a flavor. I have made better brisket at home.  I was shocked.  The mac and cheese had an excellent crust, although their choice of cheese blend was disappointing because it was rather bland.  The best part, by far, was the cole slaw, which is saying something because it was just cabbage, Italian Dressing, and red onions. Honestly, the City of Chicago has really poor BBQ choices, with the suburbs having much better quality and much better selection.  I would make the trip out to LaGrange, Westmont, or Naperville than get some substandard BBQ that doesn't satisfy my craving.",0.9803,0.703,0.197,0.1,0.6377976190476191

2014-09-23,2.0,"About 2 weeks ago, 2 friends and I went to a BBQ joint in Chicago called Smoque. We were craving some meat especially some really good brisket. Smoque was on the show Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives about 7 years ago and has built a reputation for good BBQ around the Chicago area. And it so happened to be that when we were there, the Food Network was filming at Smoque again! They wouldn't tell us what show it was for though, but it was cool to see the Food Network there. When we got to Smoque, it smelled really good. You could smell the meat and the smoke and it made us hungrier. We decided to go family style and share everything. We got the sliced beef brisket platter with Mac & Cheese and BBQ Beans, the Rib Combo (Half Baby Back/Half St. Louis) with Brisket Chili and Cornbread, we added a Texas Sausage, and for dessert we got both the Peach Cobbler and Bread Pudding. Coleslaw was included in every platter. The food took about 10 min to be served, but it felt like 30 cause we so hungry. I had to stop myself from digging right in to take a quick picture of the food. After we all took our pictures, we went straight in for that brisket and one word came to all of our minds...mushy. The brisket was terrible. It was not brisket and it was definitely not BBQ. It was boiled meat that has been boiled for too long and served with a less than average BBQ sauce. There was no smoke ring, no smoke flavor, or any flavor at all. Yeah I know it's supposed to be fork tender or melt in your mouth tender, but there is a BIG line between melt in your mouth tender to having the whole piece disintegrate into nothing before it even touches your mouth. The sauce tasted like generic BBQ sauce that they poured in vinegar and mustard. It was nothing interesting or spectacular. The brisket chili was horrible. It was watery, no flavor, not enough salt, the beans were too mushy, and the brisket was non-existent in it. The cornbread was not good. It was not sweet, it was not savory, and it had no corn flavor. And the coleslaw tasted like pure apple cider vinegar and that's it. The vinegar was so harsh that any flavor or spice they put into that coleslaw was just obliterated by the vinegar. Then we moved to the Rib Combo. This combo was good except for the coleslaw and the baby back ribs. The baby back ribs were okay. They weren't the best ribs I have ever made nor were they the worst. There could have been more seasoning on it, more smoke, and it was overcooked. People think that ribs are the best when it falls off the bone, but to me that's wrong. The meat should be tender but when you take a bite out of the rib, the rest of the meat should still stick on the bone. That's exactly what the St. Louis ribs did. This was the highlight of the entire meal. These ribs were really good. It was nicely seasoned, you could taste the smoke, and it was perfectly cooked. This platter also had the 2 best sides as well. The BBQ beans were good, but it was just a little too sweet. It could have used more vinegar and mustard to cut down that sweetness. The Mac & Cheese was good as well. It was creamy, cheesy, and rich, just like how every Mac & Cheese should be. The panko topping on top added the crunch the Mac & Cheese needed The Texas sausage was also really good. It was nicely seasoned and had that great snap to it. This is a must get as well. However, the dessert was a huge failure. They were stone cold and did not have that wow factor that desserts have. The peach cobbler was just completely one note. The crunch on top was soggy, the peaches in syrup should have been bubbling so create that warmness in peach cobbler, and there was no pastry base to it. It was more of a crumble then a cobbler. The bread pudding was so dense, heavy, and dry. It needed more of that pecan caramel topping on it. The topping was actually pretty good. It added that necessary crunch to the bread pudding. For almost $20 per person, Smoque was not worth it. It was way over hyped for what it was worth. Maybe they were having an off day or maybe Guy just got it completely wrong, but this was definitely not a place where I had to check out in Chicago. Overall this whole meal could be summed up in one word. Disappointing.",0.9925,0.76,0.144,0.097,0.5457153582153584

This also comes with 1 side. I tried the mac 'n cheese which was also heavenly. It was simple yet refined. One of the best m'n'c's that I've had. No fancy schmancy cheeses here but I swear tastes amazing. I also opted to try the cornbread, which was nothing special. I personally prefer my cornbread on the sweeter side. I wish I ordered myself the peach cobbler bc it looked delish, but oh well next time. A few things to note, I wish there were more BBQ sauce options. The meal came with just one. For a BBQ place that's kinda not too legit. Also, I felt a bit rushed when I was eating. The line was long, and the busboys were running around cleaning plates...

Was thinking that the bbq would be comparable to the mouth-savoring juicy brisket that just melted in your mouth with its tangy sauce. But sadly, it was just, okay. It was nice. No doubt about that. It got the appropriate messiness that came with eating bbq, where your hands smelled of the smoky aroma a day after you ate it. And you got that feeling in your tummy of the mass amount of beef that you just threw into your belly to be slowly digested and rendered into some scrumptious fat by the amazing body that you have. Yet, the fries in all honestly were the highlight. The fries were a cross between in-n-out and Five Guys fries. They had that fresh crispiness of an in-n-out fry but a little larger towards the steak fry persona. Texas links were good, but not memorable. I just remember them being alright. And FYI, the wait in the line is pretty sporadic. You go into line to order your food; then pick it up when they call your number like a good o'le bbq joint. When I got there, I was at the tail of the line that went straight to the door. But once I got my food, I sadly watched the line dwindle to 3-4 people to reach the all holy cashier. So would I recommend this place? I would for a try. Does it live up to its hype? Sadly, I think that this is another one of those places that was over-hyped.",0.9805,0.799,0.158,0.043,0.685

Let me help you out...you should already be standing in line deciding what yumminess you'll be partaking in. Are you there yet? Hurry up, you'll likely have a while to wait once you arrive if you're planning on eating there. On the other hand, if you're not there yet, stop and pick up a 6 pack to enjoy with your meal. This spot is BYOB (if you're eating inside)! I'm a HUGE fan of the chopped brisket. I pretty much always order it, unless I'm going for the pulled pork, which is a rare occurrence. If you're getting the platter - which you probably should be - you can get 2 sides and slaw. I'm not a cole slaw person, so I always sub in corn bread - YUMMM - but I've heard the slaw is pretty good. The mac and cheese is my favorite side to add...so much so I may just grab 2 mac and cheeses. Don't judge, now that we live in Seattle we don't get to enjoy this gem nearly often enough, so I've gotta get it when I can! Other delicious options include: the texas sausage and the ribs - you can add a taste of something to your meal for a few bucks so you can have more deliciousness to devour.

2014-09-03,5.0,"BELIEVE THE HYPE. Smoque has been at the top of my eatin' to-do list for a long time. My wife finally took me there last night for my birthday dinner. I'll spare you all kinds of flowery language and just say it plain: Smoque is -- by far and without question -- the best barbecue I've ever had. I've had BBQ in all kinds of places, and nothing comes close. This is the real friggin' deal. And BYOB to boot (indoors, not on the patio). THE MEATS: - Sliced brisket: juicy, tender and covered with excellent bark. I only needed my fork to cut it, but honestly, it was so tender a stiff breeze probably would have done the job. It's served with a thinner, somewhat tart sauce that balances the rich smokiness of the beef (no need to drown it in sauce, a little dab will do the job). - Pulled pork: as my wife put it, this was the most ""pulled"" pulled pork she ever had, as it fell into beautiful shreds when met by a fork. The pork also had a lovely bark and was perfectly moist. - Ribs: Seriously. These ribs. I'm a rib fiend and these were the best I've ever had. They're the perfect texture (tender, but not mushy/sliding off the bone). The ribs are covered in a crackling bark and come with a thicker, sweeter sauce (again, no need to go overboard on the dipping, the meat speaks for itself). - Sausage: Excellent smoked beef sausage. Not much more to say here -- if you dig Texas-style smoked sausage, you won't be disappointed. THE SIDES: - Slaw: I typically avoid slaw at BBQ joints because the gloppy, mayo-blasted stuff you usually get is foul. At Smoque, the slaw is fresh and acidic with nary a drop of mayo in sight. It's made with a simple mix of cabbage and red onions and was a nice counterpoint to the BBQ. - Beans: Not your typical baked beans. There's no sugary-sweet thick glaze on these guys, which is a good thing in my opinion. They had a thinner, more vinegary sauce that was studded with little bits of brisket. - Mac and cheese: Cheesy, crusty -- nice and straightforward. They didn't try to get cute with anything here, just cheese sauce and noodles, nothing else needed. - Fries: Crispy, hot and salty. What else could you want? - Cornbread: Excellent cornbread. It's not some crap made from a box mix. It was warm, fluffy and buttery, and had whole kernels of corn in it (which I love).  THE SERVICE: The staff at Smoque was great. They have a team of hosts/runners/waiters that get you a table, bring you your food and clear trays away. They were all friendly and helpful. You pay at the counter then take your seat, but make sure to throw a few bucks in the tip jar for the team -- they earn it.  We actually got a bonus rib portion because when I went to pick up our sample tray, the gal behind the counter said the piece was too small (it wasn't, but who am I to argue with free ribs?). All in all, this is one of the top 5 meals I've had in Chicago. Like I said at the top, best BBQ I've ever eaten. I will definitely be back.

I can't adequately describe how good this is, so just get it. Rib combo: didn't compare to the brisket, but they were both really good. I was a much bigger fan of the baby back. Super tender and flavourful. Sides: The fries were surprisingly amazing. I don't usually associate these kinds of places with standard bar fare.

The place features a decent selection of bbq meats and has various combo options. I tried the pulled pork sandwich, the brisket chili, and the slaw. Everything was delicious! They actually use a decent bread roll for their sandwiches as opposed to sliced white bread that falls apart. The pork was flavorful and didn't need to be drowned in extra barbecue sauce. I appreciated the chili wasn't your same-old ground beef, and the slaw was not your usual mess of vague vegetables and cream.  All the above merit this place a high rating. Yet, my praise does not end here.  We arrived 30 minutes before closing and stayed at least another 20 after the kitchen closed. None of the staff tried to rush us, even after we had finished eating and were chatting oblivious to the emptying restaurant. I am often unaware of signs, for example, hours of operation.

Long lines tend to mean great food though so eventually my roommate and I decided to suck it up and go. Boy were we glad we did! The line actually moved quite quickly, it's just constantly growing. The service was great and the perfect blend. You place your order at the counter and someone will seat you. Then, they let you know when your food is ready and you go pick it up at the counter and take it back to your table. When they called me, majority of my order was ready except one thing. They offered me a free cornbread to apologize for the wait and said they'd bring the last thing to my table. It was a nice, thoughtful, simple touch.  Now onto the food. I got both types of ribs (no regrets) and my roommate got the brisket. I was shocked but I actually liked the St. Louis style ribs even better than the baby back ones. There was a ton of meat and while it's a dry rub, it comes with killer BBQ sauce on the side that you can drench them in. I dipped everything in that BBQ sauce. Fries, corn bread, ribs, brisket, my hands, my face. It was so good. I tried my roommate's brisket as well and it was so ridiculously tender it just fell apart in your mouth. I'm usually a die hard rib person but I will probably actually get this brisket next time I go. (and maybe a side of ribs for good measure).  All in all, the wait isn't that bad and is definitely worth it for the food! Note: it is BYOB and you can't drink if you sit outside.",0.9943,0.73,0.203,0.067,0.4843707482993198

So at Smoque I decided to order 1/2 rack of St. Louis and a brisket taste (4oz). This was the best brisket I have ever had it literally melted in my mouth. The bark was perfect not a over powering rub it was about the beef! They did put sauce on the serving but just a touch, it didn't need it but at the same time I was happy it was there it just add another layer of OMG! It was super juicy with just the right amount of smoke and moist moist moist!  I also got a 1/2 rack of St. Louis style which like the brisket had a great bark, smoke and perfect rub. The meat was moist without sauce and the flavor very much about the pork!  Now to the sides most places I have been to the sides are just sides and seem to get less attention. We got Baked beans, corn bread, cole slaw, brisket chili, Mac and cheese and fries.  The baked beans were the star of the sides absolutely amazing with a great smokey flavor! All the other sides were great as well fresh and flavorful.

2014-08-11,5.0,"We arrived at Smoque shortly before the dinner rush, which, trust me, get there before 5.30-6 or pay for it with smelling the BBQ and having to wait.  Lets start with the ordering process, which is a bit new and was confusing for some. You look at the chalk board when you walk in, and once you have your mind made up, hit the counter up and order things. You take up residence inside at a table or on the patio and wait for your number.  Waited for about 10 minutes for our order... half a slab of baby back, chopped brisket sammy, baked beans, mac-n-cheese, corn muffin, slaw and bread pudding. Hearing your number called... Its like winning the lottery. Tears fill your eyes as you hit the pick up window and as you hit your seat, your tears of joy turn to tears for the dead pig you're about to destroy. The ribs are good without sauce, but with their house bbq... dear, sweet baby jesus... they could cure world peace issues. Lets just put it that way. They have amazing chew, are lean, and pull from the bone perfectly. It's not melt away pull from the bone, but it gives you that gnaw needed to strip the bone and that's amazing. Brisket... oh brisket... more. Need more brisket. Damn sitting not at Smoque and thinking of the brisket. The PERFECT brisket. It melts into the bun, and melts in your mouth. Such amazing flavor all around from the bit of flour baked goodness of the bun to the salty/sweet/briskety flavor of the meat and smoke. I almost cried when the sandwich was gone.  Sides... corn bread was amazing. Mac-N-Cheese is killer, slaw was not bad (I've had better), beans were killer - and even better when you put some of that BBQ in with them. And.... the bread pudding. Order this, it may be the best bread pudding you EVER have. No joking that you'd get it here, it's absolutely fantastic.

I tried the sliced brisket platter.  The brisket was good, but I've had juicier.  The vinegar-based BBQ sauce was pretty good.  Hubby's 1/2 slab Baby Backs a la carte were so tender, juicy, and delicious.  They took an extra 10 minutes to make, but they were worth it.  Since the platter already came with the slaw and 2 sides, we just split those and an order of cornbread, which was more than enough for 2 people.  The coleslaw was a delicious vinegar based slaw that had either celery seed or dill seed, which gave it a great flavor kick.  The mac & cheese was also very tasty.  The fries were the best side - freshly made, not to thick or too thin, just right with the salt, and dusted with pepper.  They taste just like my favorite Kettle Brand Krinkle Cut Salt & Freshly Ground Pepper Chips  Cornbread was extra - it's the kind with actual corn pieces.  Big plus that they have both types of ice tea - YAY!

Portions were fairly generous and pricing quite reasonable - even more so when you factor in the BYOB aspect.

2014-07-11,4.0,"Being from the South I was raised on a steady diet of BBQ and I'm admittedly kind of a snob regarding the art of the ""slow and low.""  Most midwestern BBQ is too sauced-up and mushy (Folk around here call it ""tender"".  I call it regurgitated nursing home food.  Meat is supposed to be chewed at least twice before dissolving.  Ok, off my soapbox now...), so there aren't too many BBQ joints I dig around here.   Smoque is one of the few places in Chicago that makes really good BBQ and isn't pretentious (BBQ and pretension are NOT good bedfellows).  You line up to order and then get in where you fit in as far as a table is concerned.  Sharing tables is encouraged, as all real BBQ joints do, so the atmosphere lends some credibility to the food.  I withheld the 5th star because they need to do something about that ""sweet tea.""  It's ok for the midwest, but a 5-star smokehouse needs to have a big urn of fresh-brewed sweet tea!   All in all, Smoque is one of the few places I suggest whenever asked about where to go for good Q.",0.9533,0.871,0.118,0.011,0.4904761904761904

2014-07-11,4.0,"For openers, if you think the best barbecue is usually found in the worst part of town, in a place with bars on the windows and just enough grease on the table to write your initials, then this isn't it. If, on the other hand, you're in Chicago and wander a few blocks off the Kennedy onto Pulaski in a neat little neighborhood and you can find a parking place  (a real problem ) then BBQ Smoque will serve you well. This is Texas style barbecue in the hear6t of the Midwest, except here they use apple wood rather than mesquite and the flavor shows. Count on standing in line to place your order, and then standing around to pick up your order when your number is called. And no grabbing a table in the interim. They have folks who will try to be polite telling you they'll show you where to sit, but only when your food is ready.  Inside, maybe seating for  50 at tables for two that can be pushed together, and outside maybe enough for 25 more. The menu is on a blackboard. The prices more than fair for the quality. We tried the chicken, pork (pulled), brisket (chopped), and ribs (St. Louis cut) and the table was divided as to which topped the list... but even the number four choice was better than just good.  Personally, the chopped brisket was exceptional. Full flavor, just enough fat to keep it moist and chopping the brisket helps avoid those dry, stringy slices you can sometimes get off the end. The ribs had a nice thick coat of rub and were smoked to nearly perftection. Tender but not falling off the bone - always a giveaway that they've been parboiled or baked in advance of the grill.   The pulled pork was very good, and the chicken was equally as good.  Go for a combo plate and you can help but come out with a great meal. Smoque's hand cut french fries are world class; no need to say more. The baked beans were fair to middlin', the slaw was thin sliced cabbage in a vinegar based sauce with thin slices of a red onion; different and better than a lot of them.   The mac-n--cheese was a great choice with a crispy top. They have a couple of sauces, and here comes a complaint: one is called a Memphis style sauce (thick , fairly sweet tomato), the other a Carolina sauce which means there's vinegar involved.  They decide which you'd prefer based on your order; you wouldn't use the Carolina red with chicken... but what they don't do is let you decide how much of either you want to use.  They put a shot on your order and a little plastic cup with what they think goes well, and you've got to go back and ask (and ask again if you want more) for any extra.   Why not put two containers on each table and let folks serve themselves?  It's got to be cheaper than buying thousands of those little plastic gizmos, and there'd be fewer people trying to get back to the counter. For most true barbecue lovers, the drink of choice is either a cold beer or sweet tea and it's in that department that Smoque misses out on the fifth star.  Their sweet tea is colored water with not enough flavor to pass the blindfolded taste test. And what's with those three gulp paper cups they provide for your drinks? Having to stand in line for refills (the tea and soft drink dispenser are in a crowded corner) is an unnecessary waste of time (always a long line waiting) and results in the table being tied up longer than necessary.  Bigger glasses please.    The service is self, so there's not much to say about their folks except they're all friendly and eager to help answer questions for first timers. The p;lace is kept clean despite the volume of barbecue lovers who find their way to Pulaski Street. For someone who has spent a lifetime in pursuit of the perfect barbecue (read reviews of 60+ other barbecue joints across the country), I'd have to say while Smoque isn't it...  it is awfully close.  Once you've found a parking place and made it inside, stay away from the diluted sweet tea, order extra sauce from the get go, and get set to savor some very good cue.",0.9988,0.807,0.163,0.03,0.5258991228070177

2014-06-21,5.0,"This place is the bomb! Seriously the best BBQ in Chicago. Snowier has been featured on shows like Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. The ribs are great, but the brisket is better than most that I have had in Texas. For those who don't know Texas brisket, just think about the most tender, juiciest beef with a good smoke flavor. The bark (or crust) is good enough to be served as a dish by itself. It is juicy, fatty, perfectly crusted goodness. If you get the ribs, don't settle for the baby backs (which are still tasty). The Kansas City style ribs have more meaty, BBQ flavor. Why settle for less when you can have more? The pulled pork is also very good. It's like a North Carolina style pulled pork, but without as much clear, vinegar sauce. I like my NC BBQ very vinegary and sweet. The red sauce that Smoque uses is good but not as authentic. The sides are also extraordinary. I esp. like the mac and cheese, which are served in individual tins--creamy, cheesy goodness in a cup. Their beans are also great. They use leftover beef brisket in the beans for extra flavor, texture, and goodness. They have a couple of BBQ sauces, one for the pulled pork and one for everything else. Their house sauce is sweet with a hint of cola (trust me it's good). Smoque was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, in one of the earliest seasons. It lives up to its reputation.

We walked up to a line out the door on a nice warm day and waited what seemed like 30 minutes. It was the nicest day that week in the spring so as you can imagine people were out and about on the street mulling around. No amateur mistakes were made as we grabbed a six-pack of brews from Hangovers Sports Bar and Liquor Store just a couple blocks north.  Once we got inside we cracked a beer and anxiously debated what to order when we got up front. Half slab of baby back ribs, Texas sausage, and the brisket with corn bread, mac n' cheese, and baked beans. About 10 minutes after we put our order in it was time. Hot damn everything was good but the brisket was great and is worth the drive back. I enjoyed the beans best of the sides. Around 30 bucks for two to eat and it was a perfect helping.

The biggest tip I can give for this place is to either go at 11:30AM or 1:30PM, the seating is very tight and you need to experience the food....not be stressing over where you are going to sit. They do a very good job of getting you in and out, but even when you are eating there during the lunch rush you feel those eyes glaring at you to wolf down your meal so that they can have a place to sit. Better to go when you have a little leeway with your lunch hour and you aren't in a rush, I guarantee you will be back. Typically when you cater from there they don't have fries on the menu because they don't travel very well, but if you are close you should order the fries for sure they are amazing, and if you are eating in they are a must.

The meat isn't very flavorful, and I had to sprinkle some salt. The fries were good, but could use some salt. The macaroni was good, but the portion is too small. I don't like that it's in an aluminum container, because you can't microwave it. If you don't eat it while it is hot, you have to turn on the oven, unless you want to lose most of it by trying to spoon it out onto a plate. Others had the pulled pork. I don't like pork, but theirs isn't porky. The baked beans were OK.  They had a bread pudding special. It was good, I never had bread pudding before.

Ribs were chewy and tough, seriously, they were hard to eat. Best part was the brisket.  Melt-in-your mouth delish! Now in to the sides. Corn bread was ordinary. Slaw was fresh and crisp, OKAY. Mac-n-Cheese HEAVEN but only a micro portion that was consumed in two bites. For the $2+ I was disappointed.  Summary - overpriced for ordinary food.

Great flavor on the bark and strong smoke so no sauce was needed. Not the most tender ribs but the taste overruled this short coming. Mac n cheese was good as well. Good crust on top cheese blend was good. The bad: The brisket was over cooked and didn't have much flavor. I have seen other post describe it as pot roast like and I would have to agree. Not much smoke flavor, bark was no where close to what was on the ribs.  Overall the brisket wasn't horrible, it just wasn't what I expect brisket to be. The pulled pork was not very smokey and didn't have much flavor at all. The texture reminded me of tuna fish. The bun was pretty boring too.

For sides - cole slaw, mac&cheese & corn bread.  We topped it off with Pecan bread pudding.  Plus, we got two drinks to wash everything down. It was A LOT of food for less than $40.  By the way, this place is BYOB.   Main meal: Baby Back ribs were flavorful and smoky BUT dry and a bit tough =/ They sold out of St. Louis ribs about 40 minutes into my long wait in line. Perhaps the higher fat content of the St. Louis ribs would be more tender and moist. Sad day for us.  Chopped brisket was the same - flavorful but dry.  Their BBQ sauces were also disappointing.   Sides: Cole slaw was perfect compliment for the heavy foods. Light vinegar, no mayo. It was very refreshing.  Corn bread was fluffy and had actual bits of corn =) My favorite item out of the whole meal was surprisingly their Mac&Cheese.  Very flavorful, perfectly cheesy and I loved the crumbly breadcrumbs baked on top.   Dessert: The bread pudding was yummy but cold by then.  We took it home and ate it the following day reheated.  Definitely, much much better.  Next time I would even add a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top (not available @ Smoque). One last note - ALL the food was served lukewarm which was a huge disappointment.   IF I was to visit again, here are the things I would do differently - Order St. Louis ribs, sliced brisket, & pulled pork.  I would also SKIP THE LINE. Call in a order before, pick it up, take it home, & heat it up before eating it.",0.9926,0.778,0.169,0.053,0.5336640211640211

2014-03-30,5.0,"Smoque BBQ is my new favorite BBQ place.  My dad, who often complains that everything is ""far,"" said that Smoque was ""well worth the [50 min] drive."" I had the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich with chopped brisket and pulled pork.  I admit, the brisket was a little dry, but their BBQ sauce is outstanding and I doused my sandwich in it.  The sandwich was huge, half of it would have been filling enough with all the sides.  Sandwiches come with coleslaw and the choice of one another side.  I ordered the macaroni & cheese, which is the best macaroni & cheese I have had at any BBQ joint.  It was creamy and had a crunchy topping.  I usually don't like coleslaw, but it looked pretty good and I ate a few bites.  It's fresh, not that slimy stuff you see everywhere else. I came here with my husband and parents, so I got to sample a LOT more of their other food.  The St. Louis ribs were just okay (again, a little dry), but I'm not a rib person.  Okay, stop cursing me out, I don't like ribs.  Anyway, I also tried the Texas sausage.  I didn't know what to expect, but it had a nice snap and wasn't too spicy. In addition to sandwiches and ribs, they offer ""tasting"" portions of just about everything for a few bucks.   Even the peach cobbler was fantastic.  Nothing disappointed us here.  On top of all of this, it's BYOB! It's worth noting that they were busy on a Saturday afternoon, as expected.  The line was almost out the door, but we waited maybe 20-30 minutes max from the line to receiving our food.  They have a good system here - wait in line, order at the counter, and when your food is ready, THEY tell you where to sit.  This prevents people from ""saving"" tables and camping out while they wait for their food. For two of us, we paid a little more than $40 and received a lot of food.  We all left stuffed and happy!",0.9929,0.791,0.166,0.043,0.5269781144781145

2014-03-28,3.0,"Having gone to Kansas City last fall, I was fortunate to have a taste of what this country has to offer in terms of BBQ. Though this doesn't even come close to the tastes of that city, I'm glad I visited Smoque as it's been on the list for some time. The good - the mac and cheese.  I'm the pickiest person when it comes to mac and cheese to the point that I don't care for the way most restaurants make this childhood staple. Smoque's version ironically did me just right. The cole slaw was also nicely flavored and cut through the fattiness on the rest of my plate. The fries were a favorite of mine.  Thicker fries go well with BBQ and I was happy with what I received. On a side note... Smoque gets points for presentation as well if you are into taking pictures of your food. But I did like the music and the overall sloppiness left on my hands and face which makes me feel like I just had BBQ. The bad - the brisket. It was cooked too long or too high resulting in a brisket that practically fell apart like a pot roast. I was hoping for a little more texture.  Also, the crust on the brisket slid right off which was due to the fat underneath. A bit weird for me.  I didn't care for the sauce much either. There was a flavor in the sauce that made me pass on the extra provided.  The ribs were also very tough. You can't really separate them easily and biting in doesn't really work that way it should. Were this place in KC it may be out of business. Here in Chicago there are lines out the door. But that's expected in a city known for hot dogs, beef, steak and pizza. With mixed feelings, I'll hold in those BBQ cravings until I have the opportunity to once again head down South.",0.9779,0.837,0.121,0.042,0.5255856595511768

2014-03-15,5.0,"Smoque BBQ represents a new era of food to Chicago. In the past couple of years, Chicago has been seeing an influx of true BBQ restaurants; we're no longer tied to just a par boiled rib slathered in BBQ and then slapped onto a grill. Smoque is the real deal. Amongst the BBQ restuarants in Chicago that I've tried (The Patio, County BBQ, and out in Wheaton, Steamboat BBQ) Smoque is arguably the best. When you go to Smoque's you will immediately see an incredibly full dining room and probably a ridiculous line. This is always a good sign to me. There is very little service involved here, walk up menu and then a host will seat you (""host"" being a loose term as they are the waterboys, they clean and they help people line up if its getting crazy). When your order is ready you get up and get it, so again, service doesn't mean much here. That being said I've found everyone there very helpful and kind, though busy. The food is the main attraction of course and when I went to Smoque I had the BBQ Rib Combo. I wanted to try both the baby backs and the St. louis ribs. The St. Louis style ribs are much better, some how more tender and definitely more flavorful. Full of smoke and pork flavor and deliciously meaty (they're not too thin but thinner than the baby backs for sure). I was very happy with the baby backs as well due to the real smoke flavor however if you are deciding between the two, save yourself the trouble and get a full slab of St. Louis ribs. I will note however, that both ribs were a bit dry on the edges. I attribute this to the inconsistencies of BBQ smoking. This is not an easy thing to avoid when you are cranking out many racks of ribs a day so I let it slide (especially since this may be the most faithful BBQ representation in the area). However as time goes on I expect this to get better.  The BBQ sauce they serve with the ribs is also very good; smokey and sweet. I did not find any hot BBQ sauce but you might have to ask for it; I hear they have some off menu add-ons that you just have to know about.  For the sides I had coleslaw, beans and fries. All of which were very good. The beans were smokey with quite a bit of bacon bits and the coleslaw was actually excellent. It was my favorite side. The slaw was not the creamy kind you normally get from BBQ restaurants, it was tangy and refreshing. The fries were also good but honestly I don't really care too much about the difference between fries as long as they're crispy and tasty. Overall, Smoque's is great representation of what is possible for BBQ in Chicago. We're long overdue for real BBQ flavor and I'm hoping that Smoque's only gets better over time. Here's to more BBQ in the area! Also, if you're from UIUC and are trying to compare to Black Dog's, in terms of ribs I still prefer Black Dog's but they give you less meat and they're more expensive compared to Smoque's. As for brisket I only tried a little bit here at Smoque's but I think Smoque's has Black Dog's beat.",0.9975,0.807,0.155,0.038,0.5749029618805738

The cole slaw was great and I usually do not care for cole slaw, they make it with vinegar and no mayo which is a plus  I was not crazy about the St Louis ribs and the baby backs were slightly better as the meat was too tough for me.  The mac and cheese was okay and the baked beans were too runny, but they did pack a good flavor.",0.9893,0.678,0.26,0.062,0.6125

The line was really, really long, but don't be discouraged - it also moves pretty quickly, and we needed pretty much that amount of time to decide what we wanted to get anyways. We ended up ordering: a full slab of baby back ribs (for me) and a pulled pork sandwich (for him), along with orders of fries for both of us.  The star of the meal was definitely the baby back ribs (worth four stars, I think). They were tender and flavorful, and the sauce that came with it was fantastic.  The pulled pork and fries, however, as the reason that I'm giving Smoque only three stars. The pulled pork was simply not that great - dry and a little flavorless, even with the little tub of sauce drizzled all over it, and the bun was nothing to write home about. The fries were only a little above lukewarm when we got them, and they were drenched in oil - twisting it a little bit resulted in squeezing drops of oil out.  Service was fine and quick, and we didn't feel like we were being rushed at all by the servers - although we did feel a little rushed because the rest of the diners were eating at an incredible pace. We saw people get their food, scarf it down and disappear from the restaurant within fifteen minutes. It was actually crazy, although I'm not going to complain too much, since it did result in us being able to get a table.  Overall: I would go back for the baby back ribs, and I saw some really great looking brisket at the table next to us.

2014-02-21,5.0,"Finally, an oasis in the BBQ desert.... For years, Chicago was a place where decent bbq could be had at a reasonable price.   I remember  when places like ""Leon's,"" ""Curt's"" and ""J&B's"" were affordable treats that my parents and I used to look forward to.  Sadly, times changed and before long, prices went up and quality went down.  For years now, I'd considered Chicago, where I was born and raised a place where BBQ could only be purchased from almost upscale places (Carson's), or from places that have bullet proof glass (Alice's, Barbara Ann's). After hearing and reading about Smoque for years, I finally made my way North to give it a try. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. The Meat Baby back Ribs: The center of my BBQ universe.  These did not dissapoint.  The meat was tender and came of the bone easily, but is was easy to detect the smoke that had kissed this meat.  They were delicious and I was sucking bones.  I gave the bones to a co worker for his dogs.  I'm sure they also liked them.  A St. Louis Ribs:  Even better than the baby back ribs.  Meaty, tender well seasoned.  I am a fan.  A+ Pulled Pork:  Good, but not as good as I was expecting from a place like this.  The same as pulled pork you can get anywhere. C Brisket: The only brisket I've had that was better than this was in Houston.  Amazing. Tender, moist and full of flavor.  Get this, even if you usually don't eat brisket.  A+ Texas Sausage: very good with a little bit of spice.  Way better than I was expecting, but not the star of the show. B Mac & Cheese : While the serving size is small, the mac & cheese is creamy and tasty, baked so that there is some nice crust on the top to add texture.  As a mac & cheese lover, I can't give it an A, but it provides a nice balance for the sauces and well seasoned meat. B Baked Beans: There is a unique taste to them. They are a little sweeter than I am used to and seem as if wine or Worcestershire was used. Another small serving, but good.  My girl was not a fan, but I was. This is my Yelp not hers, so there.  B+ Fries:  Hot and crispy, but nothing to slap your mother over.  Make sure you eat them fresh, they won't handle travel well.

Also very impressive were most of the sides.  Though I'm not a huge fan of coleslaw in general, the others in my party found this coleslaw to be excellent-- great flavor, with some apple added.  The mac n'cheese and the cornbread were both ridiculously good.  When you first get the little cup of mac n'cheese it seems small but the richness is such that the serving is perfect.  The cornbread is also baked in little individual cups and is very rich and delicious.  The fries were nicely seasoned and cooked perfectly. On a service note, when most of our order was ready, they didn't have any fries ready to go.  Though we didn't mind waiting a couple of minutes for them, they gave us a free side of chili to apologize for the wait. We will absolutely be back to satisfy our BBQ cravings!",0.996,0.706,0.274,0.02,0.6366071428571428
2014-02-19,5.0,"Went here for Valentines day on a date night. And if you are thinking that stuffing yourself silly with pork and side items is as romantic as it sounds. You are absolutely correct.....They were running a special of full rack of ribs and 2 sides for like 18$ I believe. I decided to go big and get this with 2 sides and a extra side of cornbread and a side of some bread pudding concoction they were serving up. The ribs were some of the best I've ever had and it was indeed a full rack. Kinda looked like two racks of ribs stacked on top of each other to be honest. The meals come out on aluminum serving trays and we had some much food they had to bring out a extra tray for our sides. Needless to say, cupid himself would have fallen in love with this meal. For the sides I had some cornbread and brisket chili and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was awesome as well as the brisket chili. The cornbread was good but they serve up the sides in little aluminum cupcake sized containers which are fine for most of the sides they have here but could be a little more generous when it comes to the cornbread. Anyways, they also give you plenty of extra BBQ sauce on the side for dipping and it is sweet, salty, spicy and everything you'd want for a BBQ sauce. The bread pudding was also some of the best I've ever had and it was another one of those cases when I was actually kinda sad when it was all gone. I still cherish it's memory, kinda like you would a childhood pet that was once a important and close part of your life but is now gone forever /sigh....

Sure, the meat was tender and tasty and the sauce was divine, but I was expecting out of the world flavor when I heard Smoque had the best BBQ in Chicago.  The portions are also pretty small for the sides. I was underwhelmed by the Mac and cheese but it was my fault going in with high expectations. The peach cobbler was a nice ending to the meal.

By time we got in line to sitting on our table with the food was about 20 minutes or so. Not bad. Plus, we were preoccupied by having some beer while in line. Speaking of which, BYOB.  BBQ Food, Chopped Brisket: They ran out of sliced brisket, so I ordered the Chopped Brisket meal and it came with 2 sides + coleslaw. A mound of Chopped brisket placed on my tray looked like a challenge to eat and I barely finished it. The charred flavors was just the right touch and the sauce in the meat was just enough. They do provide extra sauce and if you want, you can order 'extra char' Side # 1: Mac and cheese was baked with breadcrumb on top. Very delicious. A little small for the portion I thought, but it's probably a good thing since I had so much food anyways.  Sleeper side pick #2 : Peach Cobbler. I waited until I was finished with everything and man, this was the highlight. The crust was the best part. Crispy exterior with soft exterior.  Coleslaw: I grew up seeing my parents eat KFC coleslaw and having tried it once, completely turned me off from it. Smoque BBQ's coleslaw was surprisingly good. I ended up combining it with the brisket and the contrasting flavors blended well. Apparently this is how they do it in the South? Maybe I'm wrong, but it was delicious. Baby Back Ribs: My friends and I split a half slab and it was delicious as well. At some point the brisket and the ribs tasted the same. Not sure if they use the same rub, but it seemed like it.  Overall, a must-go. Tough to get there though because of the location, but they do provide parking in the back. Make sure you read the parking signs!",0.9949,0.809,0.175,0.016,0.44958829365079367

Their sides deserve mention as well.  I don't really care for coleslaw in general but their coleslaw is wonderful.  It doesn't have an overpowering mayonnaise taste that's become so commonplace.  Their baked beans incorporate some of their chopped brisket!  And their ""side of fries"" is a big bag of beefy potato fries. The bottom line is that Smoque BBQ is the quintessential standard of barbeque in the Midwest.  I only make 2 suggestions: come hungry and don't be impatient if there's a line out the door because the food is worth it!

The place is quite small and the seating is family style, you order at the counter and pick up at the counter, although sometimes the ""seaters"" (the guys who stay alert and seat you as soon as spaces opens up) will pick up your food for you. So don't let the long lines deter you. However, if you're in the neighborhood and don't see a line, don't think you got lucky - it'll be a Monday, and Smoque is closed on Monday.",0.9461,0.84,0.106,0.054,0.3733333333333333

2014-01-11,2.0,"My first time at Smoque with my wife and two teenage sons. I was really looking forward to trying a few things out after hearing so many positive reviews. We ordered a full slab of St Louis ribs, chopped beef sandwich and a pulled pork sandwich.  We arrived early, probably around 4:30 and the tables were already full with a line of people still waiting to order. I was worried we wouldn't be able to sit but as soon as we got in line an employee asked if we needed a table and reassured us one would be ready as soon as we had our food. Another concern I had was that I didn't pick up any of that sweet hickory smoke in the air that I would expect at a real BBQ joint. The wait wasn't bad and we did get the table as promised. Now to the food. I really appreciate good BBQ and the exterior appearance of the ribs was excellent. Upon cutting the bones apart however there was no pink smoke ring at all. The meat was gray. That was pretty disappointing. Although the ribs looked good and smoked from the dark brown/black exterior, they really lacked the soul of a true BBQ rib. The meat was tender and fairly juicy so not a total disappointment. My wife had a chopped beef brisket sandwich, which was also good but not great. My 18 year old son had a pulled pork sandwich which he said was as good as the ones I make at home. That's either a stellar endorsement or a slap in the face. The sides were the fresh cut fries, the best of the sides, cole slaw, which had way to much onion in it, mac and cheese, which was also good but not great, and the beans which were a close second to the fries. Overall I'd rate our meal at 2.5 stars based on the service. Would I run back? No, I'm still looking for the best BBQ in Chicago.",0.9967,0.721,0.216,0.062,0.46358225108225115

2014-01-03,3.0,"Dear Smoque, I think your food is good, but as a native Texan, my expectations for barbecue proper are unseasonably high. When graded on a curve, I have no choice but to ding you. Smoque is hailed as the reigning champion of Chicago barbecue. I've yet to eat other contenders like Lillie's Q or Chicago Q, so my review of Smoque is strictly in silo with my Texan (re: better) and other BBQ experiences. Smoque's brisket looks the part. Squint and it doesn't look unlike an offering from Austin's own world famous Franklin BBQ. The char looks legitimate, the smoke ring is present, and the meat looks fall-off-the-metaphoric-bone worthy. Wherein lies the rub? In the taste. Smoque's brisket is by no means dry; it just lacks the requisite flavor. Smoque does take great care to make the best brisket they possible can make. Take a moment to read its BBQ manifesto, and it's clear that they are trying to emulate Hill Country 'cue with its brisket. Smoque even imports its sausage from a famous Texas family, the Mikeskas (I'd stop by the Columbus post all the time en route from Houston to Austin). As for the more near and dear to Chicago style, the pulled pork and ribs, I had the great misfortune of stopping by the nothing-short-of-amazing Pappy's Smokehouse in St. Louis on my drive up from Texas to Chicago. Smoque's ribs and pulled pork are both good; Pappy's is better. At this point, it's hurting me to give Smoque a three-star rating, since its BBQ is really tasty and I definitely plan to go back again. Smoque just needs an extra push to go from good to great, and I hope it makes it there.",0.9959,0.738,0.211,0.051,0.5341975308641975

2013-12-10,5.0,"I've been going to this place for about 4+ years now. Since then there have been a handful of very good BBQ spots that have been opening up in neighboring parts of the city, but this is still my go-to spot when I want great BBQ.  My standard orders are usually brisket or St Louis ribs (sooo good!). The brisket is so tender that when you try to pick up a slice with your fork, it will fall apart if you don't get it into your mouth quickly enough. And friends that I have gone with also speak fondly of their pulled pork (personally I have never tried it), and when I feel like something else besides red meat, I go for their chicken. I know most people might think, ""Chicken? Really? If I'm going to get BBQ, I'm getting red meat."" Well I've been here enough to want to change it up from time to time, and their chicken is EXCELLENT. Easily some of the juiciest, most flavorful chicken I have even tasted. They also have pretty tasty sides. I'll start with their 'slaw. If you order a plate or sandwich, the 'slaw comes with it. Personally I think creamy 'slaws are disgusting, and until I went to Smoque I thought ""creamy"" was the only type of 'slaw out there. Smoque's 'slaw is vinegar based and is pretty damn amazing. Whenever I go, I get a large container to go, to have as a side with my lunches. Their beans, mac n'cheese and fries are all must tries as well. I'm not a fan off their cornbread, but I know some that are; and from what I hear their peach cobbler is pretty damn tasty as well. I've never had it, because by the time ""dessert"" enters my mind, I am stuffed!  I will say that if you're thinking of carrying out, you may want to have realistic expectations. I've carried out 3-4 times and EVERY single time, the meat is too rare on the brisket. I feel like they may just save the rarer stuff for the to-go orders since most people don't check their food until they get home. I'm not say that's 100% the case, but it's hard for me to believe that my luck is THAT bad. That being said, I've never been any less than absolutely satisfied, when I dine in... hence the 5 star rating. I'd recommend this place to anyone living in Chicago who hasn't tried it, and anyone passing through (and I actually did. I had family in town from FL a few weeks ago and I told them to go. My uncle is VERY picky when it comes to food, and he said it was the best BBQ he's ever had in his LIFE!!!).  :)",0.9979,0.768,0.193,0.039,0.5747444831591174

The has a wide variety of items, but we ended up ordering a full slab of ribs consisting of 1/2 baby backs and 1/2 St. Louis style as well as brisket and pulled pork. For sides, we got mac 'n cheese, brisket chili, fries and cole slaw. The ribs were my favorite by far, namely the baby backs. The meat was incredibly tender and just slid off the bone -- could've eaten a whole slab by myself. With those ribs and a thick slathering of their tangy BBQ sauce, I was in heaven. The brisket and pulled pork were amazing too, both being flavorful and smoky, but didn't quite shine like the ribs. Out of the sides, the brisket chili was disappointing. The flavors were muddled and needed more seasoning. The fries were crispy and hot -- there's something about eating them out of a grease-soaked brown paper bag that makes that much more appetizing. Mac 'n cheese was creamy and cheesy with a slight brown crust on top just how I like it.  I enjoyed every part of this meal.

Both were delicious, but I prefer the baby back ribs since the St. Louis is fattier. None fall off the bone since they are smoked. For our two sides, we chose the Mac and cheese, which I would recommend, and the chili, which I would not. It was a little too watery. We also ordered a platter of pulled pork a la carte (8.45).

2013-10-28,3.0,"There are those who would be grimacing if they saw me give this excellent BBQ joint only 3 stars. But I tell the truth, and the overall truth at that. Yes, their food is delicious. But the four times I went there (seems like enough times to be considered fair), one time they were a victim of their own success outright, having a sign in the window which said they were out of many of their items. Sadly, we had waited in line just to get to that point. The other three times, even with a shorter line, the experience is very much a 'cattle call' style: wait in line to get in. wait in line to place your order. wait to get an open available table. mull around for your name/number to be called when the food is ready. It's not table service, in other words. It's counter service. And for these prices, I'd like to have a better dining experience. That being said, the food is very good. Flavors are excellent. Why, however, has food been received cold or room temperature, if it's coming from the staff to me? I don't know, but about 1/3 of the time, that's happened. I will say, the staff is friendly even as they rush people from one position to the next. They are handling high volumes of food and people, so it's to be expected in such a small space. I'd suggest going off hours for a less hurried experience. It's a tight fit, but the food is worth it. Yes, there are other barbeque joints out there, but I like the variety myself.

And although you may feel guilty walking past the fools in line and going straight to the register, you deserve it for planning ahead.  Even just calling on your way over will get you a lot closer to that brisket platter.  Oh and ask for the thick sauce too.  I prefer it to the more vinegary style sauce that comes with the platter.",0.9773,0.815,0.156,0.029,0.4570346320346321

2013-10-16,5.0,"This is my husband and my favorite bbq in Chicago. The first highlight is of course the food. They have 2 types of ribs: st Louis and baby back. The st Louis ribs are more rich (fatty) and are award winning. Personally I prefer the baby back (my husband prefers the st Louis) because they are leaner, to me taste meatier. The brisket is good too- my husband prefers sliced over chopped- melts in your mouth. The pulled pork is also very good.  Cole slaw is citrus based which I prefer and comes with the platters. As for sides my favorites are Mac and cheese and fries. The brisket chili is also very good. Less impressive I thought were the peach cobbler and cornbread but nothing is bad. Lastly, the service is great. The owners are really friendly and are great at customer service. I ordered the wrong type of ribs and without saying anything- they just saw my husband get up with my food- they came up to us and got me Baby back ribs even though they hadnt made a mistake. They have two sauces if you ask- the usual and spicy. I recommend going early. There usually is a line out the door and the meat can run out. I think we ordered around 645 and there was plenty, still a line out the door. It goes fast and seating is cozy but somehow always works out by the time you get to the front.

Smoque elevates BBQ to a different level; not better per se, but more of an element of style. I do wish they'd vary the menu up a bit, to include the mac-daddy of all bbq meats, burnt-ends, but alas, I'll settle on the pulled pork. Adding a ""taste"" to your plate is always a bonus.

We probably waited 10 minutes which gave us the perfect amount of time to figure out what we wanted. We shared (2 people) chopped beef brisket, half slab baby back ribs, peach cobbler and mac and cheese. I wasn't IN LOVE with the brisket, but it was good. Everything else was delicious. I like my BBQ saucy, so we drenched the ribs in sauce and they ended up giving us a piece extra because they shorted us a little. We didn't ask, they offered!

The sauces are tangy, sweet and/or hot, but they are definitely off the chain! I always order either their fall off the bone ribs and/or their brisket sandwich.  The sides are very small and more appropriate for a 3 or 4 year old child. Their price point is moderate, but not super inexpensive. This is one of my favorite BBQ joints in the city.  The service is well organized and the super long lines move relatively quickly.  This is a hole-in-wall type of place.  Have you heard of ""Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives""?  The Triple ""D"" show with Guy Fieri?  I would describe this restaurant as a ""Dive"" Diner. It is very small and tables are close together. There is outdoor seating during the summer months (albeit a small one). The main attraction at this ""Dive"" is the food. Go here for an early lunch and skip all the crazy long lines at dinner time. Once I went here at 8 pm and it was super crowded even late in the evening. Parking can be a bit challenging, but it is free street parking only. I give the food four stars. The customer service gets three stars. Although this is one of my favorite BBQ joint, I sometimes think it is over-rated. I have tried to figure out what is ""unique"" about their BBQ compared to other BBQ restaurants in the city -- I can't come up with anything!  This is a place where one stands in a long line, order your food at the counter, pay for your food, THEY TELL YOU WHERE TO SIT, wait for your number to be called (listen hard because it gets very, very loud in this place) and pick up your food and beverages.

I walked in at a quarter to 9pm on a Sunday and was greeted by a friendly young man, ""Hello, ma'am.' I was afraid he was gonna tell me they were closed, but when I asked, 'Are y'all still open?' he smiled and opened a hand toward the counter. I stepped up and ordered a pulled pork sandwich a la carte and a brisket platter entree with french fries and peach cobbler as my two sides. I was even offered, ""For here, or to go?' I ordered carry-out and sat down to wait. My number was called and I was handed a bag full of piping hot food that smelled delicious. When I got to the car I noticed it wasn't even 9 o'clock yet. Wow, quick service. I couldn't help but sample the fries on the way home and they were sooo good! When I got home and ate my meal, it was all I could have asked for, and more. The meat was perfectly tender. If you want sauce on your brisket you'll have to pour it on, because it's too tender to dip. The slow-cooked brisket tasted similar to that my grandma used to make. I really enjoyed it. I tried a piece of the pulled pork sandwich, and it, too, was really tasty. I like that they put the sauce on the side. I'm a dipper, I love sauces, but the meat is just as delicious without it. The entree also came with a side of slaw which is vinegar based and made with fresh cabbage. The peach cobbler was really flavorful and I like how it was served in an individual tin, and that it was warm. I would add a little more crust and/or almonds to the topping, so it' s a little thicker, but that dessert was absolutely nothing to complain about! I was in the restaurant just a few minutes before they closed as I awaited my carryout order, and while there were loads of customers still eating at the tables and a bunch of workers moving about, it didn't have a stressful atmosphere at all. The people who work there all had super friendly demeanors and the food I was served was hot and delicious.

Should have asked if they had meat in them. Ill take the blame for that but I will absolutely come back here next time I'm in town. Only next time I will order a salad to go with the half chicken.

2013-09-17,5.0,"These ARE the ribs you've been looking for. BBQ crawl stop #3. Best ribs and best brisket (chopped)! Also most low-key and affordable. You know when you have an idea of what kind of BBQ you like, but never quite find it? Well, that's the way it was for me before I visited Smoque. I've tasted many delicious ribs lot of places, but I finally had the ribs I've always known were out there somewhere, right here at Smoque. FANTASTIC! Our mini crawl was coming to a stop with our bellies being pretty full by the time we arrived here. We were able to park just down the street (for free, no less), and were happy to see no line on this sunny summer Saturday at about 4 pm. We walked in and right up to the counter, only one person ahead of us, and lots of seating. Yay! We got a combo for $22 of 2 half racks of ribs (1 St. Louis, 1 baby back), 2 sides (peach cobbler and BBQ beans) and it comes with coleslaw as well. To that we added ""a taste"" of sausage and of chopped brisket, for an additional $3 each. So, for $28, we really got quite a lot- and took leftovers home! Next time, I'd really want to try the chicken quarter. WOW, did that look phenomenal! I chose the chopped brisket based on Meghan H's review that it was basically burnt ends- my favorite, and oh my, I'm glad I did. They were juicy, succulent, full of flavor and just outstanding. It really does compare well to burnt ends. Great tip Meghan, otherwise I might have waited til another time to try. It is making me salivate right now, actually. :-)~ The sausage we had was good, but I felt it tasted better the next day. But, the show stopper for me, was without a doubt the baby back ribs! They are what I've been looking for my whole BBQ life. The blackened crust was devine, the meat was not quite fall off the bone, it was juicy, smoky, flavorful, a lil spicy- everything ribs should be, and what you expect them to taste like when you find yourself watching a BBQ cook-off on the Food Network for one too many hours on a sad Thursday night. It was really hard to discern the better of the two, but the baby back just slightly edged out the STL ribs. Both were outstanding. Just as a note, my husband liked these second best for the crawl, as he said they tasted a bit of liquid smoke. Apparently, either he was high, or I'm totally ok with that. Either way, I'm so happy I know where I am getting ribs from now on. The sides were just ok for us, tho I did really like those BBQ beans, and my 2 bites of the cobbler. But this was most definitely all about the meat, baby.  Overall, this is a more ""spill-friendly"" environment I'd be comfortable with taking kids to, and again, the most affordable of the three today. One might even say it was a tad grimy, a real down-home kinda place. But we were grimy too by the time we left, so I guess that's ok! **Yay, 200th Yelp review, & it's Smoque!**",0.999,0.751,0.213,0.037,0.5185030525030525

2013-09-15,5.0,"As a Mississippi and Memphis guy, I'm going to be prideful and say I'm qualified to make a few comments.  My comments are based on three visits. Anyone can accidentally knock a brisket out of the park just as Darwin Barney accidentally hit six balls out of the park this year.  First suggestion. Toss the chicken and sausage off the menu. It has no place at a barbecue joint. I remember ordering my first hot dog with ketchup in Chicago. No one told me different. Down South, they would be even less polite. ""Did you say chicken, sir?"" ""If so, you have about 3O seconds to leave before my angry uncle put a brick bat upside your head and makes your eyes crossed."" As for the sausage, sell 'em out of a hot water, hot dog stand. Common trash. Do the O'Mally's  live with the Vanderbilt's? RIBS: wash yo hands because they so good, you'll smack yo mama. Excellent dry rub that isn't too salty like 98 percent of ribs. Seriously slow cooked as they must be. How can one tell? Put your plastic silverware down and pick it up like you're supposed to. Hold it by one end. Does it seem top heavy because it leans and perhaps even cracks and breaks in two. Of great importance, of all meats ribs are the easiest to cheat on. From this point forward, look at the fat on the exterior and between bones. Should be about 2O percent max. Score 9 BRISKET: For the most part, brisket is a fairly lean piece of meat. It is the toughest to tenderize because it's the thickest. If the middle is warm and moist with a black/brown, but not burned crust on top that is seasoned in a highly pleasing manner, someones doing something right. Here's a test for great seasoning. Scrape a little off with your knife and hold it on your tongue. Sure, salt is an ingredient, if it seems to be the largest ingredient, your eating at a poser's restaurant. I'm not a big brisket eater and often rely on what others say. I'd like to take my buddy Steve here once a week and order him brisket. It's the only time he don't constantly run that damn mouth of his. Score 8 The sport of kings: Horse racing. The meat of his heirs: PULLED PORK. So Smoque, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways. You and your pulled pork  can go toe-to-toe with anyone, anywhere, anytime. I admit, I was surprised and humbled by the people who would attempt such a dish above Interstate 4O. That stuff will make you want to fist fight a rude man just because everything else is right with the planet while enjoying meat that is of varying color which is normal. Yes, there can be a bit of grease. Guess what, take that away and you got beef jerky. It's like comparing a fillet with sirloin. Marbled means magnifique. Smoque's had less grease than any PP I've tasted. That means when the pork is pulled, they actually may discriminate against a few pieces. To come in Smoque's and not order PP is like going into Mike Ditka's and not eating the veal chop. The knowing chaps and chapettes  give each other a wink. All seven judges concur, even the contrarian Bulgarian judge. This PP is a 1O. * CORN BREAD preference is like having a bias for a Ford F-15 or a Chevy Silverado. Regardless, you should wear a bag on your head if you don't eat cornbread with your barbecue. That sounds mean, but it's true. I like CB slightly sweet and crumbly without pieces of corn which is just plain nasty.  ** PEACH COBBLER has somehow become a custom at a barbecue joint. It's tough to pull off. Peach season is 1O weeks long and even then, why fool with fresh because your customers are used to, and want, what you have been serving. I'm addicted to sugar so I have to have desert. My peach cobbler provided the strongest memories of Smoque. The line was backed out the door. I sort of stuck my head over the stainless steel into the cutting area of the kitchen. I shouldn't have done it, but I asked the cook if there was a way to get desert  without going to the back of that line. In two seconds, he produced the peach cobbler and said to pay later. The peaches were a four. The warmth was an 8 and the crust was a shocking 1O. You'll never guess one of the ingredients of peach cobbler.  Butter. Butter is a food group, but that's for another time.  Loved the ladies and gents working throughout the restaurant. Pros. Thanks y'all.  -ralph",0.9746,0.829,0.095,0.075,0.533037574404762

Smoque does that. When people talk about Chicago, lots of people mention the hot dogs or the deep dish, but they should really be talking about the BBQ.  Food here is served as ala cart items or you can order meat with 2 sides and slaw. When you enter, you order and pay at the counter, but then they seat you and bring the food to you.   The Meats: BBQ Brisket: This was one of the most tender and juicy cuts of meat I have ever had. In combination with the smokey char on the outside, you can tell that this meat had been smoked for no less than 14 hr. After 14 hrs this meet was so soft and tender on the inside that you thought it had been watching nothing but adorable puppies forever.  Ribs: If you are a fan of getting messy when you eat BBQ, don't miss this treat. The meat literally melts off the bone. It has a Memphis style dry rub that really makes the ribs very savory with just a little bit of sweetness from the BBQ sauce. I did not want to use the wet naps afterwards, because i wanted to lick all the sauce off my fingers. The Sides: mac and cheese: This mac and cheese was melty & rich and a great complement to the savory pile of meat.  Slaw: Okay, I know that slaw might be an after thought for you.  You think it's something that people throw at you because its easy to make, but I really liked their slaw.

Stopped by on a Sunday night around 8 to find a line out the door. Not crazy it length, but SLOW moving. While waiting in line a gentleman came out to announce they were out of both chicken and St. Louis style ribs. Wasn't planning on ordering chicken anyway but I was bummed about the ribs - but in the end somehow I DID get some!  Conversing with locals in line, it seemed the brisket is THE item to get here. If you order one entrée, you are able to order a 'taste' of everything else for $3.50. So I decided my plan was to order a 1/2 slab of babyback ribs, and a taste each of the brisket, pulled pork, sausage, and St. Louis style ribs.  1/2 babyback ribs - dry, a little tough, not much flavor. 1/5 brisket - moist, nice flavor, fall apart tenderness. 4.5/5 pulled pork - good. nothing memorable though. I've had better, I've had worse. 2.5/5 sausage - stunningly flavorless. no kick. nothing. 1.5/5 St. Louis style ribs - MUCH better than the babybacks - though no where near as memorable as those I've had in Texas or Memphis. 3.5/5 Final verdicts: - Place is NOT worth waiting in any line for and doesn't compare to BBQ veterans like Memphis and Texas - IF you decide to wait in line, there isn't anything worth ordering other than the brisket.  - Staff are extremely friendly and sharp - Happy they don't bath everything in sauce and that it comes out the side with the exception of the pulled pork.

Brisket was delicious, pulled pork was excellent.  After having experienced the pulled pork at Smith's luau in Kauai (whole hog cooked 24 hours in an earth hot stone pit) I have yet to find an equivalent anywhere.  The sides we ordered were Mac&Cheese, Fries, Peach Cobbler, and the brisket chili.  Most notable was the brisket chili.  Was lucky.  Noticed that they had just finished slicing brisket, and they had put all the scrapings in the brisket chili pot prior to serving my portion.  Prices from my perspective as a New Yorker were a bargain for barbecue.  Would spend at least 40% more for the same platters in the city.  One of the reasons I love coming to Chicago is the BYOB, which we took advantage of at Smoque with their blessings.  Will save the 5th star for our next trip when we try the ribs.  The rib standard for me thus far is Rendez Vous in Memphis.  Next stop Hot Doug's for a snack.",0.9698,0.867,0.108,0.025,0.48151515151515156

It's now on his list of ""go to"" places every time he comes to visit.  I wish I could remember what exactly we had but alas, we visited in January!  But I remember distinctly that we felt it was the best we'd ever had.  Sorry, Memphis.",0.9928,0.71,0.248,0.042,0.6011715797430084

2013-08-22,2.0,"Can't really put my fingers on the reason why this place is so popular.  I've had people say ""you HAVE to try Smoque, it will change your life!"" SO I'm like cool, there really aren't very many BBQ spots on the Northside (really in Chicago) that are decent, let alone good. So I gave it a try. First trip a no go.  Was gonna do the walk in thing. line was almost out the front door.  Also it was an odd way to have the line waiting. It's in the middle of the restaurant so you have a lot of ppl moving back and forth between the line including servers bringing food to customers who were eating in. I have issues this I know! however, something rubs me the wrong way when I see food traveling to tables having to weave its way through a line of mouth-breathers, looky lous and coughers before it gets to the table. I'm sure it happens in other places but maybe because I don't see it it doesn't bother me as much.  Anyway after catching that glispse I decided another day would be my opportunity to try them and it would definitely be via call in.  So the next time comes around about a week later (Monday of this week 8-19). The order is the 1/2 slab baby back ribs, and the brisket and pulled pork sandwiches. the ribs were so so, a little dry and the flavor combination didn't work for me before adding the sauce. the brisket a little better. the taste was good without the sauce and slightly better with. the pulled pork by far was the best of the three. And no I'm not a fat, greedy pig.  got the items for two people and we split the meals as it was her first time trying them too.  I'll keep looking for good BBQ in the city of Chicago. To me there was nothing really special about the flavors and taste of the BBQ, not to mention the layout and annoyance that I felt on my first visit wasn't particiularly great either. Still had to wait in the line to pay for my call in order and that was extended because they were training a new girl on the register.  Yeah, I'm grumpy and not an old man! I'm gonna wrap this up. Smoque to me is in the middle of the pack for taste and flavor. you can do better, you can do worst. See yeah later.",0.9782,0.824,0.116,0.06,0.4414132395382396

As the workday progressed, I realized that this hankering may be related to survival so it would be wise to fulfill.  I picked up some brisket, a slab of ribs, mac & cheese, cornbread, and the BBQ beans. They were all fantastic, and fulfilled my craving. The brisket had a deep smoke line, nice char and great flavor. One of the owners was manning the cash register, and she provided me with all of their sauces to try. I'm a bigger fan of the smoky, spicy BBQ sauces as opposed to those of the sweet variety. The ribs were pretty good too, but I wouldn't call them lights out.  All in all, Smoque does a good job and I was satisfied with their BBQ.",0.9682,0.816,0.172,0.012,0.6571428571428571

As for the rest of the food Items I would have to say that they are good but leaves much to be desired. The brisket was very bland and did not have much taste or texture to it, I t seem as if I was eating roast beef instead of actual brisket. The coleslaw, beans, macaroni and cheese were very good and appetizing however the regular sizes seem to be very small and not contain much food.

You can a sandwich, but I'd recommend going with a platter- if in a group you can get a hearty sample of the different meats, served on paper/cafeteria tray.

Their call ahead feature and carryout is top notch. The food always stays warm (and reheats well if necessary!), and you can lounge while devouring the best Smoque has to offer.

My girlfriend ordered the pulled pork sandwich, which she enjoyed. I had the sliced brisket with a 1/4 slab of ribs, mac and cheese, and peach cobbler. The brisket was absolutely the best I have had in my entire life. Perfect rub, great bark, and the smoke was just heavy enough to give you some of the flavor from the wood, but light enough that you could taste the meat. I grabbed a fork, however it was not necessary. The brisket was fall apart tender, my hands worked perfectly. The ribs were very good as well, however they were really overshadowed by the brisket. The mac was cheesy, but not overbearing, and the baked crust on the top was tasty. The peach cobbler was decent. The crust was awesome however I'm 99% positive it was made with canned peaches..they had somewhat of a rubbery texture.

Now, anyone will tell you that I am very picky when it comes to brisket.  I grew up in TX and while I have had some amazing BBQ pulled pork in the midwest and northeast, I haven't found many places whose BBQ brisket provides the same lean, smoky, tender meat-eating experience.  Smoque does.  And also, there was the tasty BBQ sauce, HUGE portions (mac & cheese, peach cobbler, vinegar cole slaw) all shared between two people and it was more than enough, we were stuffed.    Now, I haven't yet tried the more ""hot and trendy"" joints (BellyQ, Bub City) in Chicago to compare, but can say with all honesty, that Smoque is the real deal.",0.9484,0.878,0.103,0.019,0.49565217391304356

2013-08-04,3.0,"The hunt for good BBQ in Chicago starts with a line out the door. The wait was roughly ~30 min to 1hr to order. Upon ordering, we were escorted to a table that was held for us by the hostess (or something similar to). Their food arrived on a metal tray. This place is probably as good as BBQ gets in Chicago (and I'm a bit disappointed given Chicago has such wonderful food/restaurants/eateries). It's definitely not a top-tier BBQ place. The ribs, brisket, and pulled pork were OK, but could be quite dry and overcooked. The cole slaw was rather enjoyable with a vinegar-based dressing (I'm accustomed to mayonnaise being from the south). The brisket chili was nothing special, with the brisket not adding much to the party. The menu is also more pricey than I'm accustomed to paying for BBQ, but this isn't a large point given it's in/near Chicago.  I also found it odd how the owner (or who I presumed to be the owner) is sort of on watch over his customers. His interactions seemed a bit odd/strange, acting almost like a statue in the corner. If an owner is out on the dining floor, I'm usually accustomed to seeing him ask how things are going/how the food is. Instead he was just sort of...there... Also not a fan of the seating method, but I guess they need to sort people when there's a line snaking out the door.  With the price I paid, I would've preferred eating elsewhere as Chicago has a huge HUGE selection of places to eat. Smoque will satisfy the BBQ itch, but you'll need to go elsewhere for really REALLY good BBQ. Rewards on their wall also seem to reflect this, as I don't recall seeing anything that was non-Chicago awarded. This is probably not the most valid point, but if you've got a car and a day, go to Pappy's in St. Louis. Their ribs are probably the best I've ever had.

Smoque, you have indeed forsaken me, and forgiveness from me is not easy to come by. I wanted to like everything about you but I just couldn't do it. If you turned out to be less than perfect, I would have rounded up for you, Smoque. But, I have too much disappointment. When I arrived with an empty stomach, but the line out the door stood in my way, I waited like a trooper and took it in stride. ""Lines mean it's a great place,"" I reassured myself. When I was met by an eerily robotic cashier that took my order, I brushed it off as efficiency at work. When I scanned my surroundings and took note of at the limited seating and the forgettable décor, I was able to push that aside. I promised myself it was because they care about food and not paint swatches. However, when my small portion of pulled pork showed up, lightly dressed in a vinegary sauce that I just wasn't quite a fan off, I was a little saddened. I had some of my girlfriend's chopped brisket and liked it, but was still let down. The mac and cheese arrived in a baby cupcake tin with a cheese sauce that was quite separated and gritty. I then relied on the brisket chili, which should have had a rich barbeque flavor, to be the home run to save the game. However, the dominant flavor was tomato with a tenuous barbeque-ish undertone. Now, don't get the wrong idea, the food was pretty good. However, my goal for the night was not to have something categorized as pretty good.  I have not completely written the place off.

The inside leaves something to be desired, I get it it's a hole in the wall, but after many years of success you would think you would fix the chipping paint on the wall of awards. The seating is very tight and awkward, there's a host to sit you, but it seems like they love to sit people in awkward places. I felt like many of the employees were encroaching on people's personal spaces and the service leaves something to be desired-it's very much ""what do you want, ok, payment?, next"" and you're just a number here. We came here today during lunch time and it wasn't very packed.  I have to just come out and say it that Guy Fieri you my friend are a liar, and I trusted you. You are paying roughly $11 for a sandwich the size of a big mac (in width, not in height), a ""fruit cup"" size of macaroni and cheese (and it is not ""dynamite, again Guy what the hell?), small piece of corn bread (that was actually good), and slaw. Did I feel ripped off? Absolutely. The pulled pork was extremely dry and didn't taste special and the brisket itself was good and really was the ""Star"" of the meal. Now to the sauce-we all know in the United States BBQ Sauce is a personal preference, kind of like underwear. I myself am not not not not not a fan of this BBQ sauce and neither was my fiance. It is definitely Kansas City BBQ Sauce and It was to me absolutely repulsive-very thin, very sweet, very vinegary. Overall after months of wanting to try this place and making a trip for lunch, insanely disappointing. So, if you're reading this and you love KC BBQ, then maybe you'll love this place...if you don't skip Smoque because it is awful for those of us who are not KC BBQ fans.

Tender, juicy, smoky... 3. Pass on the mac, it was just okay. However, order two sides of the sweet and crunchy peach cobbler.  4. Order a ""taste"" of meat with your dish. For a few bucks you get a hefty portion of meat to try in addition to your meal.  5. As it refers to the above statement, BBQ reheats well. Welcome the leftovers!  6. Make you order a side of BBQ beans. You won't be disappointed. 7. It's BYOB. I detest the word ""amazeballs"".

I had to reheat my meat since I came home late but even then it was to-die-for. You know something's good when it tastes amazing even when it's microwaved! Only gripe is that the sauce is kinda watery, but the upside to that is that the bread sops up the sauce that much better, making every bite count. Also wish they would've given us more sauce, I could've used it to dip some random things in...it is THAT good. Just do me a favor and get your tush over to Smoque. You won't regret it!

Balanced BBQ, low and slow, which is the rub, spice, smoke, the quality of meat, and the sauce. Everything in their menu here is exceptional to damn near perfection. Pulled pork, awesome. Ribs, full of flavor and fresh fall of the bone. Chicken is great as well. Texas Sausage had a nice little kick. Their sides all deliver as well, especially their brisket chili, bbq beans, fresh cut fries, and the cole slaw.

Their chopped brisket is my go-to order and it should really be renamed to burnt ends because the two are basically synonymous here at Smoque, due to how fantastically  fatty and flavorblasted their brisket is (in a good way of course).  Big fan of their ribs too. St. Louis style all the way.  The side of mac n cheese is just as to-die-for as their meats. It is so fantastically cheesy and rich and flavorful. I so love the portion size of all of their sides - the container holds such the perfect amount given how rich and flavorful each side item is. Now the peach cobbler is just SILLY - I told myself that I was only going to ""try it"", you know just one bite!......well folks, I basically inhaled the cobbler - it was gone so quickly. So I'm hooked on that too... This place is always jam-packed and the lines can get pretty long, but it goes quickly and is beyond worth it to wait.

Basically you have to order your food first and then the host seats you. The food is so delicious that the tables turn around fairly quickly. It's a really small place, so it's not even a guarantee you can sit and eat. We were lucky and were able to get seated quickly. The St. Louis ribs are amazing. Very smokey and tender. And living in the South....we know our BBQ.  We tried a taste of the sliced brisket b/c everyone said it was to die for. It was like butter! I rather have the ribs, but the brisket was definitely good. The mac and cheese was SOOOO yummy, but they only give you a tiny little cup.

Nobody was parking there b/c the sign in huge letters says no parking, but there is an exception after 5:30 in small letters.

You order at the counter and then get seated (if you're eating there).  Once your order is ready, they call your number and you go get it from the counter.   -I got the pulled pork sandwich (comes with 1 side and coleslaw).  The pulled pork was excellent...one of the best (if not the best) that I've had.  You definitely need to use the extra sauce they give you.     -The mac & cheese is extremely cheesy, oily and most likely terrible for you, but it tasted very good.   -The coleslaw was average, but helped cut through all of the cheese and pork. I tasted the baked beans and they are great...very smokey too.   I need to try the brisket next time as that looked awesome.  The service is quick and the staff turns tables around quickly.  I was able to order, eat and get out of there within 25 min.   Bathrooms:  Only 1 men's and 1 women's.  The line for the women's bathroom was long; the men's had no line.  Men's bathroom was clean and that's always a good thing.  Aside from the scratched in graffiti (what gangster scratches graffiti into the bathroom of a smokehouse?), it was pleasant.   Parking: Can be challenging.  There's a lot behind the place that has restrictions on when it can be used for Smoque patrons, and it is real precarious.  There's metered street parking available, but if you search a bit, you'll find free street parking as well.  Other than Smoque, there's not much worthwhile in this area.  I will definitely go here again and I will dominate the brisket.  This place is definitely worth a shot.",0.9936,0.776,0.178,0.046,0.5827450980392157

After eating loads of BBQ in Memphis, Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth and Florida these past few months, I'd have to say that the best brisket has been right here at home!  At Smoque BBQ!   Smoque didn't win the title for best smoked pulled pork. Though they beat out Charles Vergos's and Central BBQ's somewhat dull pork in Memphis, and some forgettable watery stuff I had in Austin. The title for best pulled pork belongs to my Uncle Gordie in Boynton Beach, FL, who injects his pork butt with pineapple juice, before slow smoking it for 6 hours, and finishing it in the oven for another 3.  Smokelicious and bark-tastic and served with a South Carolina mustard-based sauce that would make shoe leather taste good. Sorry Gordie doesn't own a restaurant.  But he did admit that his recipe is a modification of one he pulled from his favorite cooking show Americas Test Kitchen.  cookscountry.com/recipes… .  Gonna try that one out myself this long hot summer.

2013-06-22,4.0,"Be prepared to stand in line and wait. Make friends with the folks in line. Because there's nothing stronger than the bond of delicious BBQ and we had a good time talking BBQ with other hungry folks in line with us. It's a tiny corner restaurant and seating is very close to each other too, so if you didn't make friends while you were standing in line, you'll get a chance to make friends with the folks seated next to you. Knocking elbows and knees can make you fast friends.  Because this place is small, you're easily enveloped in the aroma that is BBQ'ed meat. My husband and I ordered the brisket platter and the 1/2 slab baby back platter and added a Texas sausage link. Coleslaw comes with each platter as well as 2 sides.  So we chose cornbread, baked beans, fries and mac/cheese.  The meat was delicious. The brisket is heavily marbled so it's very moist. But our new friends next to us (remember what I said about making friends?) told us that you could order the brisked leaner if that's what you prefer. Great tip!  The ribs seemed kind of small to me, but they were cooked really well. Tender meat, not fall off the bone, but giving to a little pull.  The sausage was delicious, nice bit of spice. All the meats had a great flavor on their own, but I really liked the BBQ sauce, peppery and tangy, I also loved dipping my fries in it.  The sides, except for the crunchy fresh coleslaw, were disappointing. I didn't care for the beans (a little mushy) and the Mac N Cheese (overcooked).  Friendly and helpful service. They run the dining area so well--finding a seat for everyone--so don't fret, even if a little one in your party needs a highchair.

Maybe once in the last 5 visits have I noted that the meat was a tad dry - but it's always flavorful and generous. While we still like the fries, the integrity of them (like anywhere else) is lost when you do carryout and they are not piping hot and crunchy.

For me, culinary nirvana has struck twice before: once at Father's Office in Santa Monica, California and again, two years later, at Moto in Chicago, Illinois. Smoque's sublime barbeque officially raises that number to three.   Having won a trip here through a fundraising auction, I was fortunate (read: blessed by the BBQ gods) to sample Smoque's entire menu in one glorious, pant-stretching visit. Everything from the baby back ribs to the smoked chicken raises the bar on what great barbecue should taste like. Indeed, the food here was so outstanding that my face hurt from smiling so much while I was eating.   However, the absolute star of the show was the smoked brisket - a juicy, fork-tender affair that tasted so delicious, it felt sinful to eat. Coming from a self-avowed ""pulled pork"" guy, this conclusion came bitterly at first but Smoque BBQ earned it. The brisket was bafflingly tender and exploded with flavor the moment I sunk my teeth into it. Even without sauce, Smoque's brisket outshines every barbecue restaurant I have previously been; however, add a touch of their Carolina inspired sauce, and we officially reach culinary nirvana.",0.9624,0.82,0.142,0.037,0.515625

The place is kind of assembly lined like a fast food restaurant. That is, they turn tables, fast. Also if you think you're getting your own private table to eat your meal, don't count on it. A server walks through the line and gets a count for your party and somehow by the time you get to the front of the line to order your food there is a place to sit. We were set next to a nice couple who makes Smoque a regular stop on their way through the area.  Now that you understand how the place runs let me tell you the food is nothing like fast food. The who meal was amazing and I suggest you get one thing and everyone else gets something else so you can sample a little of this and a little of that. Be aware though that they run out of stuff fast due to the fact that they make bbq the way it should be made, over hours or days of cooking. So when they are out, they are out til tomorrow.  The food is good but a little pricey for what you get. I'd suggest getting take out and going home with your food so you don't have to pay way too much for your drink.

The baked beans had me won over from the first spoonful. As to the peach cobbler, it needed a scoop of ice cream. You have to be patient to get into Smoque. Food comes fast once you're in, though.

My wife and I ordered two full racks of ribs, enough for dinner plus a ton of leftovers. Both of us agreed that the St. Louis style ribs were way better than the baby backs. It wasn't even close. The St. Louis ribs still had a good meaty bite to them, and the smokey crust on the outside was amazing. The baby backs had the same great taste on the outside, but they were actually a little bit TOO tender. They fell apart a little bit too much and you lost a lot of the great meaty flavor. All you got was the crust. We both agreed that randomly, the menu item most deserving of praise was the beans. Their BBQ baked beans are amazing!!! I would highly recommend them. The coleslaw, on the other hand, was a watery disappointment. In the end, I wouldn't say that it was the best I've had-- but a few of the items we ordered came pretty close. Smoque is the perfect name for this place-- they pack some serious smoke flavor into their meats. My hands smelled like a campfire after we were done!!",0.9945,0.726,0.231,0.043,0.5367948717948718

I've heard nothing but good things about Smoque and after a little convincing, my dad and I drove there for lunch while he was in town visiting. Yes, it's not convenient to get to, but with some spare time, a bus (or cab), you can get there without one. Let me just say, this BBQ was damn amazing in my book. I got a platter of sliced brisket and pulled pork with a side of mac and cheese, cornbread and sample of the KC style ribs. My meal was amazing. The sauce was excellent, pork was perfectly cooked and tender, brisket had very little fat and was just fall apart cooked. I cannot rave about this enough. Literally, I wanted to make inappropriate noises out loud because it was so tasty. The mac and cheese was good but very rich. Glad it was in a small cup, but still worthwhile to try if you're a fan. The coleslaw was also good, but not my favorite. However, my dad, who loves cole slaw, raved about it, so there you go. He also got the side of the BBQ beans which he loved and from my taste, I was impressed too. Very smokey flavor that was really nice with the beans. The only thing that missed the mark for me was the ribs. Maybe it was because of the smaller portion, but the KC style ribs were tough and difficult to eat. We had to cut the bones apart to get to the meat. But dad took a rack of the Baby Back ones home and said they were great, so maybe I just got a bum sample. I even went BACK inside to get food to take home, which I'm enjoying as I write this. And i still wish there were more just sitting in my apartment. I cannot rave about the food enough. LOVED IT. The service was also really professional and well organized. Staff helped us order, get seated, notify us when the food was ready and the wait time for food was short.

I asked the busser how to deal with the line- he directed me right in to the register. Minutes later we were on the Irving Park road to Portage Park for some BBQ in the grass. The trees were greened out in buds and baby leaves. The grass was lush and the ground was dry. We got two slabs of St. Louis style ribs with creamy crusty edged mac and cheese, not-sweet cornbread, well seasoned fries and peach cobbler, which we got to later. Actually there was cole slaw too, but haven't got to that yet either. The ribs were unbelievable, pink smoke ring, so much smoky flavor that my hands still smell like a campfire. They need no sauce.

You order a dish and it comes with two sides, or you can get them a la carte. When your order is ready, it's presented on a tray lined with wax paper and the sides come in their separate containers so that there's no cross contamination of different dishes (not that I mind that at all).  The portions appear small, but if you're visiting and want to try a little bit of everything, the smaller portions are excellent for that. My favorite was the corn bread, BBQ beans, peach cobbler and the St. Louis Ribs. The St. Louis ribs are to die for. I've yet to have a tender, slide off the bone rib since I lived in Texas. So this place, being NOT anywhere near Texas and having an assortment of BBQ and sides definitely made my 30~ minute drive from our hotel near Lake Michigan worth it. We also ordered chili soup, pulled pork, bbq chicken, fries, slaw and mac and cheese. Also, if you want to try something, but not sure if you want to order the WHOLE order, there's a few items you can ""sample"" for an additional cost at the end of the middle panel. That is what I did with the St. Louis Ribs. Afterwards I wished I had gotten the WHOLE RACK! The restaurant was super busy when I arrived, but there were associates who were nice enough to anticipate your seating and dining needs that they actively reserve a table for you, so that by the time you're done ordering your food, your table is ready, you eat, and then ready to head out and enjoy the rest of the beautiful city! The process is so efficient that I don't know why other restaurants don't follow their method. I was pleasantly surprised that our peach cobbler was still CRISPY even after it had been waiting on our tray for over an hour as we finished our mounds of BBQ goodness.

I went with friends again for round three for Sunday night dinner and had my faith re-established in Smoque.  As other reviewers have said, their seating system works when the place is packed because they take your name at the door and the # of ppl in your party. And you will get seated by the time you're done ordering. Don't fret.  As for the BBQ, I decided on the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich option, which I got half pulled pork and chopped brisket. Both were amazingly flavorful and juicy, and had a good amount of fatty juice that made it extra tasty. I also sampled the sliced brisket which is truly a work of art, gleaming pink meat with a beautiful charred black outside.  Sides: I tried the mac and cheese (delicious), cornbread (pretty good), bbq beans (smoky, sweet and delicious), chili (just fine), fries (pretty good), cole slaw is sliced thin and vinegary (perfect compliment to the bbq).  Sauces: Definitely prefer the spicy sauce, it is thicker, sweeter, and bolder. The Carolina sauce is more watery and vinegary. We also tried the candied jalapenos that were hanging out by the cashier, definitely try them with your bbq!  Solid, solid place in our beautiful city.

I had the half slab st. luis ribs which I thought was slightly dry and not alot of meat to eat. my bf had the sliced brisket platter with sides and we thought the portion was a bit small and left hungry even after eating.

Smoque is one of the most popular barbecue restaurants in the city.  They don't take reservations, they seat and move people in and out.  If you are going during dinner plan on standing in a line all the way out the door and weather will not scare people away.  They will ask you how many are in your party if you are dining in and you will have a chance to order before being seated.   Usually by the time you order a table is made available for you.  You will be given a number so it is important that you keep your ears open as it can become quite loud in this restaurant.  The staff is very professional and they know how to keep people moving.   I've had the pulled pork sandwich and the sliced brisket sandwich with all of the different sides.  Everything on this menu is exceptional.  Even the slaw is good for someone who doesn't really care for coleslaw.  The meat is savory and tender with just the right amount of sauce.  They offer you a cup of additional sauce if you want to add more.  All the food is served on a metal cafeteria like plate with a sheet up cooking paper.  A nice touch to the scrappy eat with your hands kind of meal.   Smoque can be kind of expensive but at least you are getting what you pay for.  For $10-15 you will not be disappointed as this is by far the best BBQ in the city.",0.9601,0.884,0.103,0.013,0.6245962732919255

I waited about 15 minutes until they took my order, then was assigned a table right next to the waiting line of people that I had stepped out of. The idea of dining amidst a human canyon isn't a good one and very nearly knocked this place down a star or two rating-wise. But after enjoying a brisket sandwich with fries and cole slaw, I just couldn't do it. This is the best BBQ I've ever had. The brisket was tender, nicely placed on a fresh bun - and a fairly good amount of meat too. The sauce wasn't too hot or too sweet - it was right there - the perfect accommodation for beef that was so thoughtfully cooked. Fries were good and the cole slaw was delicious as well - sometimes vinegar cole slaws are a little harsh - this was just fine. This place really needs a little more room and a better place for people to wait in  line. Seating was fine - the staff has it together that way, but it was a little aggravating to have all these people stand around me, along with an occasional touch of cold air coming from the exit door about 10 feet away.

Also ordered a sliced beef brisket sandwich with a side of beans. Slaw came with. First the ribs: while cooked nicely with a good char crust I thought the hickory smoke flavoring very overpowering and distracting. The smoke flavor should enhance the meat, not take it over. The fries were great and plentiful with a dusting of a spice powder which gave them some good flavor. The mac & cheese was only fair. The whole thing was dry with not much flavor and the crumb topping made a mess on the table. The slaw was fresh with a light dressing, however, the red onion was way too strong. The entire bowl smelled and tasted like onion. Finally the extra sauce that came with. For a place that concentrates on BBQ, this sauce is not good at all. It's thin and with a tang of vinegar and spices but, there's most definitely something else in there that made it have an ""off taste"". Can't quite figure out what that is but it does take away from the overall flavor. The sliced brisket sandwich was good, not great, not bad, just good. The portion size of beef was very small considering what the sandwich cost. I was expecting a pile of meat but the two halfs of the bun were touching each other. Meaning not much meat was between the bread. The beans really were not that great, kind of watery with an addition of the bbq sauce which again made for an off flavor.  So all in all Smoque was good for a quick BBQ fix, but I would not go out of my way to visit again.",0.9905,0.829,0.14,0.031,0.5343333333333333

2013-02-08,4.0,"En lieu of the Super Bowl, a close bud and I decided to head to Smoque and consume mass quantities of meat, assuming that once the game started the typical crowds would diminish.  And hot damn we were right!  We walked in and were second in line to order.  For me, there was still a competitive element to the experience even if we weren't watching the game - I am slowly making my way to all the popular BBQ joints of Chicago, and eventually I will be able to claim my favorite.  Let the competition begin... I've mentioned in BBQ reviews passed that I consider myself a decent judge of BBQ character if you will.  Yea, yea, I know what you're thinking ""everyone says that.""  Let me list my credentials: -Dad owns a BBQ restaurant and is Kansas City BBQ certified. -Sister lives in TX - So I've had my fair share of TX meats at Rudy's and Salt Lick just to name a couple of many. -Kansas City at one time acted as my second home.  Whenever in town I would eat BBQ for lunch and dinner...not a gross exaggeration - well, it's gross...but not really.  I love meat, kiddos!  I've sampled Arthur Bryant, OK Joe's (My favorite - the Z Man sandwich OMG - is this what heaven is like?), Gates...and so on.   -I'm not fancy - as in, I walk into Lillie's Q and I'm like ""whoa...what's this...where's the line?  Why so fancy?""  BBQ places should feel like a joint...or a dining hall where people from Defiance, OH have their wedding receptions (I was born there, I can make fun - you, on the other hand should not). Smoque was exactly what I thought it would be - a BBQ joint, no frills, divine brisket, ribs, and sausage (and probably pulled pork and chicken but they ran out due to the abundance of Super Bowl orders received), delicious sides, and it's BYOB so I got to enjoy it all with some Begyle American Pale Ale, and a Hop Whoopin'.   Honestly guys, the brisket was the best I've had in Chicago no contest...perfectly smoked and tender with delicious burnt bits here and there.   So why not five stars?  Well, I have one sizable pet peeve about BBQ restaurants - no sauce on the tables or at the very least readily available at my discretion.   Before visiting Smoque I had only experienced this at one other establishment - Smokin' Woody's.   Never.... NEVER in TX or KC...or at my pop's restaurant where BBQ is available on tables and/or in pumps where you can dispense your own into cups.  Perhaps I missed pumps that may have been near the fountain soda station?  But I don't believe this was the case judging by my half filled plastic cup of sauce served with my meal.   When my sauce DID run out (because let's be honest, it always does when rationed like that)  I worried, ""Are they going to charge me for BBQ sauce...at a BBQ restaurant?!""  Please say it ain't so!!   This was the case for Smokin' Woody's and I have never been back.  It's unforgivable.  Does McDonald's charge for ketchup?  Hot Doug's for mustard?  But what really bugs about the no BBQ sauce readily available is the inconvenience of stopping mid-meal to get up and get more, most likely having to wait for whoever may be ordering at the counter at the time to finish.  All the while my delicious meats get cold.  Additionally, it appears they have two types of BBQ sauce but I have no idea if I was served the Original or the Spicy.  I would have liked to try both, but in the end tried....?????  No idea.   I cannot confirm whether I would have been charged for additional sauce.  I never wanted to leave my meat to ask which speaks to how amazing the food is (or rather, what an oinker I am).  But Smoque, I've gotta know - what gives with this set up?   It left this BBQ fan a bit disappointed.",0.9958,0.804,0.139,0.056,0.5746031746031744

Brisket was over done and fell apart.  Brisket should not fall apart.  They offer sliced and chopped.  They only difference was that it was served from different parts of the brisket.  Same texture no matter what.  There was next to no smoke.  A classic problem of many amateur BBQ cooks.  I asked what kind of cookers they were using having already known the answer based on the taste in my mind.  Southern Prides.  I have yet to have great BBQ cooked on southern prides all have the same kind of smoke register.  Little to no smoke ring, also a sign of an electric cooker, who knows. Bottom line was that the brisket was unimpressive and reminded me of pot roast. The ribs were better than the brisket but not by much.  They were also over done. Meat fell right off the bone, however, this is a sign of an overdone rib. Flavor was decent.   Sausage tasted like Hillshire Farms.  Nothing special at all.

It's silly that I don't go more often since its roughly 15 mins with the highway being clear.  Anyway... Went in around 245 on a Sunday and there was a line that ran up to the entrance with almost all tables occupied. After placing my takeout order I stood close to where the food was going out and I have to say the efficiency of the restaurant is very good and the way it should be. All too often I observe issues at different places of business that could be fixed so simply! When my order was called I found a well packed brown paper bag and asked if the sauces and both ""taste"" portions were in, the girl at the counter gave me an assured yes and that was enough for me! I came home to find everything I ordered! FOOD: Chicken - I think this may be the best chicken preparation I have ever had, it originally was taken by the Publican, but I think in terms of chicken, Publican has to take a 2, albeit a VERY high 2. The chicken looks EXACTLY like it does on their site, perfectly moist, smoked and they browned exterior carrying a ridiculous amount of flavor. I will not go to Smoque and ever not get it. St. Louis taste - love the taste option here and love the fairly hard to find St. Louis rib which was DELICIOUS. Brisket - I love brisket, but not sure if I've ever had any that rocks my world, I get it when I get bbq. It was good, wish the top layer of fat was slightly thinner, although it's not thick by any means. Coleslaw - I wish they would chop it after its shredded, great flavor but think theirs would benefit from a confetti cut. Mac & Cheese - It's good, very good, but my personal preference is a ""drier"" style with less cream, rue like binding. I get disappointed by most macs, and I am grateful that I can be satiated by a few bites! Peach cobbler - OMG - will get it every time, it's divine.

Get the full rack of baby back ribs.  Get a half rack and you'll be sad.  Get anything else on the menu, and you'll be missing out. 3. Sides:  choices, choices!  Cornbread, definitely.  Baked beans--a must if you can handle the sweetness.  Don't order the coleslaw as a side--it comes as a mini-side for free.  If you are extra hungry or have someone who can help you finish, get the mac and cheese.",0.9567,0.762,0.172,0.066,0.5144557823129251

As for main courses, we tried the 1/2 slab St. Louis ribs, 1/2 slab baby back, an brisket sandwich. Sauces included were Memphis, NC, and a spicy sauce that came with candied jalapeños. Overall the meal was good, but expected the meat to be a lot more tender than it was. I later learned that they only smoke their meats for around 3 hours and it's intended to be chewier... But honestly, that's not my preference. I prefer my BBQ to be fork tender and none of these dishes qualified.

After eating all that meat (which tastes excellent dry (i.e. without sauce)) the bones left behind are almost comically big! Adding a little sauce every few bites adds the right amount of tangy sweet extra saltiness. Smoque definitely sets themselves apart from the competition by offering superior sides. The french fries are incredibly consistent, always hot and the right crispiness / tender, never limp or underseasoned. And the portion of french fries is decent as well. The baked beans and brisket chili round out my trio of favorite Smoque sides. The rib meat, combined with fresh french fries, rich baked beans, and that incredible cool crunchy vinegary fresh coleslaw is one of my favorite food experiences.

The beans were delicious but extremely small in quantity, especially compared to the size of the fries, same for the coleslaw. I really with I got half the amount of fries and at least 50% more coleslaw and beans. I thought the ribs were good and the sauce that went along with them was not bad but a little sweet for my taste, I like a spicier BBQ sauce with a good kick. The brisket I was a little disappointed with. It's my favorite BBQ food and theirs was somewhat dry and I didn't really taste the rub. The sauce for the brisket was very watery compared to the ribs sauce and I did not like that since it soaked into the bread very quickly and didn't stick to the meat as much as I would have liked.",0.9934,0.794,0.192,0.014,0.5633838383838383

It was made of cabbage and onions with some kind of vinaigrette mixture.  No mayo in cole slaw!  Everyone working there was extremely nice and friendly.  After eating, they even cleaned off and bused my table!  I felt bad as I was leaving because I should have given them a tip!  Sorry!   Definitely visit this place and tip those people that are kind enough to bus your table.  I definitely will go back if I'm in the area and will tip!  :)",0.994,0.712,0.249,0.039,0.644

I had the pulled pork sandwich with a side of coleslaw and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was pretty good, as was the coleslaw, but nothing special. The pulled pork sandwich, unfortunately, was not very good at all. The pork did not have much taste to it and when I added more of the bbq sauce to it (which they give you on the side), it did not do much to add taste to it. I have had much better pulled pork elsewhere (Carson's). My girlfriend tried to Memphis ribs. She thought that they were good.

It's not expensive but the reason is there's effectively no service and finding a table is a real pain, so come off peak if possible.  It's BYOB so bring something good (Brooklyn Local 1, perhaps?). Think about what barbecue ribs are.  You take a rather low quality cut of meat, season the heck out of it, and cook it at low temperatures for long enough to make it edible.  It's real easy to get any of those steps wrong and have it turn out really poorly.  It's really very difficult to get right every single time.  Smoque absolutely nails this, and has come up with an extremely well balanced rub and sauce to go with it.  Mad props.",0.9048,0.715,0.165,0.12,0.6846153846153847

I couldn't even finish my plate and had to ask for to-go containers. In this case, looks are deceiving. I was very full and felt as though I had just ate at a buffet.

The food comes out on lunch tray looking trays. It has a authentic bbq place feel. They give free water which is more than I can say about other Chicago places.

2012-09-29,4.0,"As a lifelong Chicagoan my idea of BBQ is different than down south, but I'm definitely the type to get up to my elbows in sauce without shame.  As I was about 75 feet from the entrance the aroma of BBQ hit me and got a big OMG.  I got the chopped brisket platter with two sides, a taste portion of St. Louis ribs, and peach cobbler.  Here's the breakdown: chopped brisket - Smoky, but not excessively so (I had a bad experience elsewhere where everything just tasted like smoke and was awful).  It's flavorful and very moist.  The portion is quite generous.  They give you a cup of sauce on the side, which I think needs work, as it's entirely sweet with no savory or smoky element. St. Louis ribs - All my life I've eaten sticky, sweet baby backs, so this took a little getting used to.  The ribs are huge and meaty, with a nice thick layer of bark from the dry rub they use.  The meat itself is just firm enough to sink your teeth into, with a little effort needed to pull it away from the bone.  Eating ribs is meant to be a carnal experience, and Smoque does it exactly right.  When someone advertises ribs as ""fall off the bone good"", give them a scowl and walk away.  It was hard to get used to ribs that are entirely savory rather than sweet, and for personal taste I still prefer baby backs, but on their own merits these are quite good.  I just don't think I'd want a whole slab of them. BBQ beans - That's what they're called and that's what they taste like.  This is not the thick, dark brown baked beans.  These are beans with sauteed onions and a pronounced BBQ flavor, and are tasty. corn bread - It comes baked in an individual aluminum foil cup and is moist, flavorful and has some whole corn kernels inside.  I'm not generally a big corn bread fan but I'd order this every time. cole slaw - As someone who loathes mayonnaise, I generally give or throw away cole slaw, but this is actually good and I ate it all.  As others have said, it doesn't have mayo and instead has a tangy flavor that made me think of Italian dressing. peach cobbler - Scorching hot from the oven, and as good as any I've had.  This will also be a staple each time I return. I got enough food to be stuffed, with enough brisket left over to make a sandwich the next day, and the grand total was about $20.  I'll go back to try the sausage and the chicken.  BTW, I went right as they opened at 11 on a Saturday and got street parking and a table very easily.  Service was prompt and friendly as everyone has said.",0.9966,0.814,0.151,0.035,0.5417071590540978

2012-09-22,5.0,"I came on a Saturday at around 3pm, and only had to wait about 5 minutes to place my order. The two of us were seated inside immediately, and the food was prepared within 10 minutes. The chopped brisket platter with sides of cole slaw, mac & cheese, and beans that I ordered was thoroughly amazing. The mac & cheese was literally the best that I've ever had and the beans had the perfect amount of 'sweetness' to them. Though, I am not a fan of the particular type of cole slaw that was served here, which involves coarsely cut cabbage and not enough of the mayo-based sauce. My friend had a side of peach cobbler, which you are allowed to have as a side as part of a meal, and it was absolutely delicious. We even ordered a couple more of the cobblers to go afterwards. A full platter, including 3 sides, will run you about $10. I will absolutely come back here.",0.9756,0.816,0.16,0.024,0.6236111111111111
2012-09-22,5.0,"There's not much more that can be said about this place that the last 1400+ people haven't already probably covered.  I had been here for the first time maybe about a year ago, but wasn't really blown away by the food.  I came back recently with a group of 7 and this time I got to try more of the different offerings and it was much better than I remembered. I got a 1/2 & 1/2 platter (it's not on the menu) that consists of your choice of 2 meats (Pulled Pork, Brisket, or Texas Sausage), 2 sides, and the cole slaw.  I thought it was a great deal since the portions were not that much smaller than the full order.  I ordered the pulled pork & brisket which were both perfectly cooked and not dry at all.   The cole slaw is really light, it's not the stuff that's drenched in mayo, and goes really well with the BBQ.  The brisket chili & mac & cheese were also good.  The chili was a little lacking in the actual brisket but the flavor was there! I have to dedicate a paragraph to the incredible service here.  You usually don't think about service too much from a place that doesn't have waiters but the guys & gals who work here are awesome.  They're quick to answer any questions you have and super friendly.  I was here on a packed Friday night with a group of 7, and usually at a place like this I'd expect to be separated with that many people, but thankfully they've devised a great system where there's someone to take down the number of people in your party and let you know where to sit once a table is ready.  The service even extended after I left the restaurant!  We were outside and one of the staff who was taking out the garbage helped out with a question he overheard us talking about, even going so far as to go in and ask one of the owners.

2012-09-20,5.0,"My 300th review goes to a very deserving, Smoque BBQ!! Mmmm...BBQ. I was recently in the area and wanted to try it out due to their popularity. I needed to see what the hype was all about! When we walked in the door, we were greeted by a packed house. We wanted to sit inside so I quickly looked around for an empty table but were soon told that once we placed our order, we would be directed to a table. After viewing all of the choices, we settled on pulled pork. The hype is true...their pulled pork was amazing. They drizzle a bit of BBQ sauce over the pork and they also provide a side of additional BBQ sauce. We also got a side of coleslaw and fries. The coleslaw was probably the best I ever had. It wasn't creamy or sour at all (I find most coleslaw to be this way). It almost tasted like it was tossed in Italian dressing, sooooo good! The fries were also perfect...warm, super crisp and seasoned well. One side order of fries was pretty large so you might want to split with someone. The place does get pretty crowded, but their ordering/seating method works and is very organized. There was someone always walking around clearing tables of trays and then cleaning the table for the next guests. They also provide ample wet-naps to wipe away the sticky mess that is all over your fingers...and possibly face? The parking situation can be a bit difficult. There is street parking and a small back lot that is available only during certain days/hours. You can find non-permit street parking which is a short walk to Smoque.",0.9896,0.831,0.143,0.026,0.49761904761904774

2012-09-15,5.0,"When I go to a place that has been hyped this much, I tend to be disappointed. That was definitely not the case when I went to Smoque. Here's how it stacked up. -Brisket: delicious and not too fatty/greasy. Order chopped if you like the crispy burnt ends -Pulled pork: Some of the juiciest, most tender pork I have ever had. Even without sauce it was moist. Even better with a little Carolina style barbeque sauce which they do so well.  -St. Louis Ribs: Incredibly meaty. Usually I don't like ribs very much because they are too greasy and fatty. Smoque uses a dry rub which is delicious and the ribs are very lean. -Mac & Cheese: Indulgently rich, with a nice crunchy topping of bread crumbs. -Baked beans: The best baked beans I've had in a long time. Little bits of brisket and heavy smoke flavor are balanced by the deep sweetness of caramelized sugars. -Brisket chili: This is the only item I tried that was not amazing. Not to say it was bad, it just wasn't as good as everything else. Next time I visit, I will opt for something else. Overall, this place is awesome and worth all the hype, and then some.

So I loveeee Gale Street Inn's ribs, but wondered if Smoque would be any similar but it was so different I'm not sure if I can compare. If Gale Street has lathered, rich sauce all over the ribs with fall-of-the-bone tenderness, Smoque has dark, smokey, home-made-bbq ribs. I felt that the BBQ sauce was lighter than super thick, which does NOT mean bad. I do not like coleslaw because it's usually super mayo-y but this one was more peppery with zesty vinegar sauce, yummy.

I didn't give it 5 stars, however, because I felt the highlight of my meal was their sides, not so much their meats. I break it down below: Sides: The macaroni and cheese comes baked in a separate metal container. It was rich and cheesy, but not too heavy - certainly a must have. Don't skip the fries, baked beans, or cornbread - all delicious and certainly noteworthy. Most importantly, do yourself a favor and save room for their peach cobbler... holy shit. Meats: I tried the pulled pork and the sliced brisket and both were solid. Juicy, tender, and flavorful - great, but not amazing. I haven't tried their ribs or Texas sausage and I'll be sure to reevaluate this review when I do.  Sauce: I enjoyed it - it was tangy with a hint of sweetness, though it was a bit on the runny side.

I recently hosted a large family party at my home and was really excited to serve their food. Two days before the party, I checked-in with Peggy from their catering office and was really unhappy with the way she talked to me. She was short with me, inpatient, and sort of patronized me. It got me really nervous about my order. I admitted to her that a handful of people RSVP'd to the gathering later than I had wished and she managed to bring my conservative $350 order up to nearly $600. It was really more than I could spend but she said this, ""So are you only trying to feed your guests just a taste because if this was my party, I'd order a lot more than what you're ordering."" That statement really made me nervous... I told her a lot of the guests were not big eaters... I also have catering experience having planned conferences for a living professionally... well, I should have gone with my gut. The food arrived, by one of the most helpful guys ever. The food tasted and looked great (the guests loved it) but I can't tell you how much food was wasted. We had two and half extra pans of pulled pork that went uneaten. We had three bags of buns that were never opened. And we had one extra container of slaw. I'd say, about $150 worth of extra food that didn't need to be there.

One note on the macaroni--you can get a small (one aluminum tin) or large (two aluminum tins, aka the large is twice the size as the small). The small is what comes with the entrees. So, if you're getting one of the sandwiches, it's actually more advantageous to order the sandwich a la carte and then a large macaroni on the side. It's much more macaroni bang for your buck (and yes, it's delicious). The seating situation is not a big deal at all.

Chicago may not be a mecca for barbeque like Memphis or Kansas City, but Smoque is definitely a stand out.",0.9861,0.784,0.189,0.026,0.45312500000000006

2012-06-18,4.0,"Restaurant: Smoque BBQ Cuisine: BBQ Location: North Center (Chicago) Address: 3800 N Pulaski Rd Price Range: $10~15 1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent Food: 4 Service: 4   Ambiance: 3 Overall: 3.5  Extra information: *Ranked #6 restaurant on Urbanspoon Chicago *Pay first, and then sit down Smoque BBQ was a random find for me. Nobody told me about it, and I didn't find it on urbanspoon or yelp. To be honest, I can't remember how I stumbled upon their website. Anyways, regardless of however I found this spot- there was no way I was going to pass up on a BBQ place. It was a few minute drive from Chicago downtown, so my friend and I decided to check it out. Smoque BBQ is known for their brisket and bbq ribs- but personally, I find briskets to be a little too dry for me. Since there were only two of us....I had to think really hard as to what I wanted to order before I visited the restaurant. Once I walked in, I was surprised to see the restaurant lay out. I was expecting a full service restaurant, but it was order and pay at front and sit whereever kinda thing. There was a guy from the restaurant guiding everybody and making sure everyone had tables, which was super helpful. Keep in mind that they don't let you sit down unless all of your party is present at the restaurant. Ordered: St Louis Rib 1/2 Combo with coleslaw + 2 sides * 1/2 St Louis Rib, coleslaw, mac n cheese and fries for $14.95 * You can choose between Baby Back Ribs or St. Louis * They said St. Louis is the meatier and fattier cut so I went with that * If you choose a combo, you get to choose 2 sides other than a coleslaw * Sides are BBQ beans, mac n cheese, fries, brisket chili and corn bread * For $14.95, this combo was huge and it could be shared between 2 people (girls) * Ribs were kind of on the dry side, and the sauce was more so marinated into the meat rather than dripping from it * Explains why there was a side of bbq sauce on the side for you to dip in * It wasn't fall-off-the-bone type which I prefer, it was kind of disappointing * Coleslaw was light and refreshing but nothing special * Mac n Cheese was so good! it was small in portion but had the perfect consistency of cheeseyness and the crust on top was to die for * Fries were huge in portion, it was good but again- nothing special  Ordered: 1/2 Pulled pork sandwich  * 1/2 pulled pork sandwich for $4.95 * This was better than I thought it'd be * Most pulled pork sandwiches I find it to be dry * But the pulled pork was so tender and juicy * I didn't really like the bun since it was toasted and made it a little messy to eat * They give you some more BBQ sauce on the side to use * BBQ sauce was tangy with the just right amount of sweetness and smokyness Ordered: Cornbread * Side for 95 cents * This went well with my meal and it was well made * It's made like a corn muffin which made it easier to eat * I could feel the texture of cornmeal when I ate it (how it's suppose to be) * If you like cornbread, it's def worth 95 cents! Summary: I looked around as I was eating my ribs and it seemed like a lot of people were getting the briskets (what they are known for). And they looked pretty damn good! It wasn't dry looking like the most briskets I've seen. I love bbq and meat- and I can't stop thinking about their mac n cheese.  Price is decent and the turnover rate for tables are quite fast.

I even told them that I didn't want to use their buns and they were fine with that and suggested how much I should get to make sure I had enough.

2012-06-11,4.0,"In my ongoing quest for the best BBQ well, ever, smoque is a top contender. I went back and forth on 4 stars or 5, and settled on four as a reflection of the overall experience. Based on the actual bbq, though, this would receive a 5+ rating. I had a pulled pork sandwich, and it was, in a word, Phenomenal. Best bbq pork I've had outside of north carolina (home to the best pulled pork on earth.) The meat was juicy, smoky, and tender. I didn't need a sandwich, I could have just eaten a mound of the meat on it's own. Perfection. 5 stars. The rest of the experience was a solid four. I wasn't blown away by the mac and cheese, and I can't handle the vineger slaw that yankees insist on calling cole slaw (if it's not creamy, it's not cole slaw.) That being said, I still ate all the mac and cheese and slaw on my plate, so it's not like they were bad. My boyfriend's meal was the opposite-- his sides were pretty out of the park (baked beans and corn bread), but his sliced brisket was just on the good-side-of-average. I was too full for an order of peach cobbler, but as I do consider peach cobbler to be my true love of the dessert world, you can be sure I'll be back for more.  one last note-- it's communal seating, but just barely.

I got a half slab of baby back ribs, mac and cheese, fries, and coleslaw. My boyfriend got the chopped brisket sandwich, beans, and coleslaw. My ribs were absolutely perfect! Smoky bark, juicy meat, not too fatty. I dunked the pieces in the accompanying regular and spicy sauce.  And... that's where I feel Smoque falls short. Where are their sauce choices?! One of my favorite aspects of barbeque is trying all of the different sauce options, from smoky to spicy to vinegar-based. Smoque's spicy sauce was yummy, but it didn't really entertain my fire-loving tastebuds. I just like variety... is that so wrong? But I'll get over it.  Anyways, back to the rest of the food. The mac and cheese is really as good as everyone says: super creamy, real cheese taste, beautiful crust. The fries seemed fresh cut and the portion was huge. I tried a bite of my boyfriend's chopped brisket and was surprised by how juicy and flavorful it was.

The mac and cheese at this place is pretty decent, but the baked beans are better.  The other thing I would suggest is that if you're like me and you're into spice- ask for the spicy barbeque sauce and the pickled jalapenos.

When we arrived at the restaurant where there was plenty of easy to find street parking in the area (about 8 on a Friday) there was still a line out the door. After waiting about 30 minutes being jostled and pushed by people cutting the line for various reasons (usually they would get a ""line holder"" then the rest of the party would try to push their way to the front through a narrow passage). Once we got to the front a guy ask us how many were in our party so he could find us a table, we ordered and paid (they only had one register open on a Friday Night with the line going out the door) then were taken to a table.  The restaurant itself was mass chaos, there were groups of very loud, obnoxious post-college types swigging vodka from plastic bottles, screaming, yelling etc. etc. I thought I was at a college fraternity party. The whole experience probably would have been more tolerable if I could have got a drink myself but Smoque does not have a liquor license.

2012-05-26,2.0,"I know, it's shocking, but my BF and I actually went to this place without checking Yelp; We found their website via Google and went based on what we saw there. Bad idea.  To preface: We are not food snobs at all. All we want is good food, good service, and a pleasant experience. We go out to eat several times a week and try to judge everything fairly, within context, and with an open-mind. I say this only because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews of this place that I do not get at ALL. They have their own parking lot, and we had no trouble with street parking. Walking up to the restaurant, the outdoor seating section looked lovely (unfortunately, it was full - at 5:30 PM on a Friday, so go early). We walked inside and were told by the busboys they'd ""seat us"" after we placed an order, but the inside was completely empty and basically had cafeteria-style seating, so, um...okay. Dress code? Feel free to show up in your sweatpants (not necessarily a complaint, ha). You place your order at the counter, much like a deli, and are given a number. We ordered from a bored young girl who couldn't have looked more unhappy to be there. Within mere minutes, your number is yelled out for you to walk back up to pick up your tray. Okay, so in a deli, your food can be made-to-order within minutes, but BBQ? No. So the food is not made-to-order. You can BYOB or serve yourself at a soda station, not unlike, again, a deli or McDonald's or Burger King. My BF ordered ribs with the brisket chili and mac & cheese, I ordered the chicken with corn bread and mac & cheese. They really are sides, quite small, which is fine. The sauce is VERY VERY VERY sweet, like, 20 sugars dumped in per serving sweet. The chicken was fine, the ribs were fine. Far, far, far from the best we've had, but certainly not the worst...just meh. The main dishes were just...fine. Nothing to write home about, at all. Maybe they'd have tasted better if they hadn't been (barely) luke-warm. The sides were excellent, and I wish they were available as their own entrees. My boyfriend completely devoured their coleslaw (I'm not a fan of coleslaw in general), so that's also a plus in terms of sides (and comes included). So, yeah. Cafeteria seating. Deli service (in the short time we were there, they went from yelling out 60 to the mid-80s - that's not impressive, that's a factory line of food...again, like a BBQ McDonald's). Food that isn't made-to-order. The entrees are overpriced, the sides are excellent. Disgustingly-sweet sauce. $40 for this? The equivalent of fast food? No, thank you, not with all of the legitimately incredible options out there. Guess it'd be alright for a quick lunch if you don't mind blowing $40-50 on lunch for 2. Their prices are ridiculously inflated for the quality of the food and the dining experience. Maybe this is ""great BBQ"" for people who never venture out their own neighborhood. It's not even charmingly simple or down-to-earth. We left super-disappointed. But, hey, the mac & cheese was delicious, so maybe we'll just order 6 side orders if a craving hits.",0.9974,0.741,0.183,0.076,0.6177982400113545

2012-05-18,3.0,"OK, so I have heard so much about Smoque that I finally got to try it today for lunch since I was working in the area. I had the 1/2 and 1/2 platter with brisket and pulled pork with a side of fries and mac and cheese. The brisket was good but It was not the best I have had. Many people on here did not like the fries. I thought the fries were crispy and good. The mac and cheese was OK but then again I am from a family that has been making REAL MAC AND CHEESE for decades.  First I have to say that I have had alot of BBQ in my life from my family and restaurants. To be honest since I have family members that have been cooking BBQ for decades I have not found any place that I feel is as good as what my family makes. I am not here to bash Smoque but just give my opinion of what my taste buds like. I grew up on the south side of the city so I can assure you that there are quite a few BBQ joints that are really good.  The difference between Smoque and other BBQ joints is that the real BBQ joints have just a few tables and maybe some stools but most of the time you have to stand and eat.  Also Smoque has the power of advertising and yelp definitely helps. Real neighborhood joints don't advertise, you either know about them or you don't. Also lets face it, a lot of people will not go to the south side. Hyde Park is as far as some people go or have ever been. With that being said people are really missing good BBQ in the city. I thought Smoque was decent and I think it is a welcome addition to the North side for BBQ. Keep in mind that this is just my opinion. I would never bash a restaurant because I think that we all have different taste buds. I had a place in North Chicago/Waukegan area called Big Ed's and let me tell you that I loved Big Ed's better than Smoque but I am sure that there are people who would go to Big Ed's and say that it was just ok and they like Smoque better.

If you order the food as a combo, it comes with two sides.  The order comes with a side of coleslaw already so make sure you pick two different sides.  We had the baked beans, french fries, mac and cheese, peach cobbler and the corn bread.  My favorite was the coleslaw.  It was made with a vinaigrette dressing and was super delicious!  My other two favorite sides were the french fries and the peach cobbler.  The mac and cheese was good too but too creamy for me.  I was surprised that this BBQ place did not have mashed potatoes. Maybe a suggestion for the future? I love me some mashed potatoes! There are rules outside of the restaurant, such as you cannot pick where you want to sit.  I guess seating is tight at the restaurant so they need to pack everyone in. We had a table sitting right next to us, even though there were other open seats available.  It did start getting busy later in the evening so I can see why they want everyone seated in an orderly fashion. Service here was really top notch.  Everyone was really nice and friendly.  Its a pay first, eat later type of restaurant so I wasn't even expecting to be served. What a pleasant surprise! Street parking is available in the area.  However, there are signs across the street from the restaurant that say you aren't allowed to park. I think its because the residents that live across the street from the restaurant don't want anyone taking up their parking spots. Be careful where you park!

2012-05-05,4.0,"Yowza, yowza, yowza!  Let me get this out there:  I looove barbeque!  I like crappy barbeque even.  What is there not to love about a rosy pink smoke ring, a crusty bark, juicy, succulent meat and a perfectly balanced sweet/sour accompaniment sauce?  (Yes, I am from the camp of bark bbq fans.) Proper barbeque should have all the above.  Smoque BBQ delivers!  Last night was my second visit.  I have tried to go on several other occasions, but the line had been out the door and I was too ravenous to wait that long.  Fortunately last night my wait was a mere 15 minutes. First, let me give Smoque BBQ a big shout out for the tasting portions!  I can be indecisive at times, and the tasting portions are reasonably priced and sized to allow me to sample without grazing on my dining companion's dinner. Now for my meal last night...I ordered the brisket chili, the sampler of St. Louis ribs (1/4 slab) and the cornbread.  The brisket in the chili was good, but I was looking for bark chunks and was disappointed that there weren't any.  It was a bit on the watery side for my liking for chili -- I prefer the stick-to-your-ribs kind of chili that leaves me satisfied until breakfast the next day.  There was, however, a nice balance of meat, beans and tomatoes in the chili.  The spiciness was very good too:  a heat that wasn't so overpowering that people who can't handle spiciness should shun away from this. Now for those ribs.  I'm drooling right now as I write this.  Boy, Pavlov would be so proud if he could see me now!  Let me sum this up quite simply:  Go to their website and take a look at the ribs.  Yes, their ribs look like that and YES YES YES, they taste like that!  They put the sauce on the side, which I feel satisfies both sides of the barbeque dichotomy.  You who love the sauce can slather that goodness as much as you need.  You who love the bark can grab a hunk and dip to your heart's content. Lastly, I can't forget that cornbread.  The cornbread was really good with pieces of corn.  Sweet, but not too sweet.  Moist, but not to the point that the bread gets stuck to your teeth.  If only they served it warm with a pat of butter on the side. And please don't insult Smoque:  Don't dare use a fork on those ribs.",0.9957,0.77,0.175,0.055,0.4713673469387755

When we walked in we were greeted by Carlos aka Omar, who asked if it was our first time. I love it when a restaurant recognizes new customers and lends a helping hand. He was very helpful and recommended we try the beef brisket. He told us it was his favorite. I also thought his story about his nickname was cute. They call him Omar because there are too many other Carlos working there. It was funny how he delivered it. So of course we ordered pulled pork...sorry Carlos/Omar. We also got coleslaw, Mac and Cheese and peach cobbler. Carlos then came over and he offered us two more sauces to dip in. I really loved the spicy BBQ sauce. It was really yummy. He even hooked us up with sweet jalapeño peppers. They were so good...I started eating them with my pulled pork. The pulled pork was amazing. It was one of the best I've had in a long time. Carlos noticed we only got the pulled pork. I think he was sad we didn't take his advice. So he brought us over a sample of the beef brisket. Oh boy was it good. I am completely torn between two meats. I know next time I will get both. The Mac and cheese was so good. The small side left me wanting more. I love the little individual foil dishes. Every container had the perfect amount of bread crumbs toasted on top. The peach cobbler was also fantastic. The crust was one of the best ever. I only wish I had a scoop of vanilla ice cream to put on top. Maybe management will add this for a summer treat. The Cole slaw was also very fresh tasting. I loved that it was not drenched in mayo but seemed to be vinegar based. While we were eating my wife told me to look over my left shoulder. And there was guy hanging on the wall starring at me. Really? Why is he everywhere in Chicago? This is starting to get a little ridiculous. He should just move here and open a restaurant. As we were leaving at 11:50am, a huge line started to form. We had beaten the lunch crowd. I also got to see Carlos in action. He not only welcomes guests and cleans tables but he is the enforcer too. Some guy was trying to save a table even though his party was at the back of the line. He very diplomatically informed the guy that he had to get others seated who were in front. I love that!!!

They have giant professional signs in the street informing you to not park in front of there houses. I found it kind of funny but understood.

Chicken was delicious - very moist - and delicious when dipped into the sauce we were given. Mac and cheese was ordinary, coleslaw dry, and fries greasy.

The gentleman highly recommended Smoque and after some research a small group of us went down there. We got there nice and early and were among the first in line to get in. I got half slab of St. Louis Ribs, Smoked Sausage, Chopped Brisket, Beans and Mac and Cheese. Their BBQ Sauce that is offered is good. I kept finding myself going back to it. The ribs were tougher then I thought they would be. When attempting to pull the bone away from the meat or remove a portion by hand there was a lot of resistance. It was one of those moments where if it would have given way I may have clocked the guy next to me. Another in my party commented on the toughness of the Ribs. The smoked sausage was good. Nothing I haven't had elsewhere though. The chopped brisket is a good choice if you want to sample the sauce in my opinion. It serves as a vehicle for the sauce to be consumed. Eating this by itself tends to get tiresome as the bites ware on. I found myself wishing I would have had the sliced brisket. The Beans were fair and the Mac and Cheese was standard that you find at more popular restaurants. Everywhere I go the waitstaff usually comments on and highly recommends the mac. Everywhere I go it typically all comes out the same. I mean really folks... its noodles and cheese and only so many combinations of the two. I would come back and get a different cut of ribs. I would also get the sliced brisket then update this review to reflect that. As it stands now I wasn't overly impressed. It was good BBQ but not really worth the drive.

This is huge. It's like Hot Dougs in that respect, which to me shows you care about your customers. My biggest pet peeve is people who sit down to save a seat for their group before the group has ordered their food. So people who have already ordered but don't have someone to save a seat have to stand around and wait. Don't do this, you are an asshole if you do this.  Their ribs are incredible, their brisket is incredible, their sausage is incredible, their pulled pork is incredible and their chicken is incredible. Their sides are the real stars though. I'd be just as satisfied eating a giant portion of their brisket chilli or french fries as I would their main dishes.

When the weather started to turn, the call of barbeque was simply too strong to resist.  I started looking for excuses to travel to Irving Park to gorge myself on sumptuous barbeque.  I finally got my chance this last week. When my girlfriend and I walked into Smoque, we were immediately greeted by a friendly staff person who helped us place our order and reserved a place for us to sit.  I thought that this was a nice touch, since it seems that Smoque can get crowded in a hurry. We ordered the Texas brisket, pulled pork, and a half-slab of St. Louis ribs.  We also ordered baked beans, cornbread, and macaroni and cheese as sides. Let's start with the good.  The brisket was cooked perfectly.  One thing that I really liked is that the meats were not drowned in barbeque sauce a priori.  The sauce is given separately for the diner to freely decide how much or how little he wants to use.  As a person who wants to taste the meat above all else, I really applaud Smoque for this decision.   The sides were also pretty good.  The mac and cheese was the standout among the sides we ordered.  The beans were altogether too sweet for my taste--so much so that I couldn't eat more than one bite. Now, for the bad.  The brisket, while cooked perfectly, was under-seasoned.  The pulled pork and ribs were very disappointing: both were severely dry.  My girlfriend almost choked on the pulled pork because it was so difficult to swallow.  Both the pulled pork and the ribs were a far cry from the best that I've ever had. I am so sad to say that I cannot recommend Smoque because of the quality of the food.  The service and prices are spot on, but they really need to put some work into perfecting their barbeque.

2012-03-25,2.0,"After watching and hearing many great reviews of Smoque BBQ, my parents and I decided to give this place a try.  The last time I had BBQ was on my way back from Florida where we stopped at this BBQ joint in Savannah, Georgia which had just about the absolute BEST ribs I've ever had in my life.  Unfortunately I cannot say the same about Smoque BBQ. We ordered baby back and st. Louis ribs along with a taste of brisket with mac n cheese, peach cobbler, BBQ beans, and brisket chili as our sides.   First: the sides.  We personally enjoyed the mac n cheese and peach cobbler very much however the BBQ beans and brisket chili weren't quite up to our standards.  The BBQ beans had too bold of a flavor in that they were too sweet and too sour.  It was quite hard eating them alone however perhaps if eaten with cornbread, it possibly wouldn't have been as bad.  The brisket chili was really just average, can't say much else about it. Second: the main dishes.  The ribs were okay.  They were very smokey and flavorful however the tenderness was off.  For both slabs we found that the ribs were somewhat tender but not exactly to our liking.  Basically not ""fall off the bone"" tender, unfortunately this is a huge pitfall for us.  The brisket was NOT ""to die for"" like many other reviewers claimed.  The texture was very grainy/rough like and was uncomfortable for me to eat.   Third: the house/bbq sauce.  I personally enjoyed this sauce however my parents do not agree with my opinion.  I thought it was very flavorful and had the right amount of sweetness and tartness to it.  My dad felt that the sauce was missing ""something"" and could be a little thicker.  In all honestly it isn't the best sauce I've tasted but definitely one of the better ones. When we arrived at Smoque BBQ, there was huge line spanning out of the restaurant.  We had to wait about 45 minutes to an hour to order our food.  Once our food was ordered it only took about 5 - 10 min for our food to be ready.  The atmosphere reminds me of a busy/hectic train station.  It's very loud and jam packed.  The tables are arranged in sort of long picnic table array, or in other words you'll probably end up sitting next to a couple/group that you don't know which was a little uncomfortable at first when our food wasn't ready.   So there is a chance that because the restaurant was really busy there is a possibility that their food isn't always as I have described it, so because of the plethora of great reviews, I have decided I will give Smoque BBQ a second chance some time in the future.  However based on our experience today I cannot rate this restaurant above 2 stars overall.  I feel like everyone who has reviewed Smoque BBQ are native Chicagoans that have never truly experienced great BBQ, but then again I could be wrong!   I hope this helps!  Cheers!",0.9943,0.774,0.156,0.071,0.4747964669738863

2012-03-05,4.0,"Before I get into the meat of this review (get it?) I'd like to dedicate it to my very tall friend Jim.  Without his guidance and insistance on making me fat I probably would never have tried Smoque. Smoque obviously is doing something right, 1307 reviews and 4.5 stars makes that pretty clear.  The food was good, the service was friendly, and the dining room is nice and clean (read: not sticky).   I had the 1/2 & 1/2 pulled pork and sliced brisket with cole slaw, fries, and beans.  Don't worry, I had no intention of eating all of that, but I wanted to try it all.  The pulled pork and brisket were both very good, either would make a fantastic sandwich.  The cole slaw and fries were also good.  Something just wasn't quite right about the beans though, they were too sweet I think.  Skip the beans, you won't miss 'em. It's a counter service place, which works efficiently here.  When I got there they were pretty much empty, by the time I was leaving there was a line to the door, so go on off peak times if you don't want to wait.   The food was worth it if you're nearby or it's on your way.  I don't know that I'd go too far out of my way to get some Smoque BBQ.",0.9921,0.773,0.212,0.014,0.6435978835978837

Fortunately the line wasn't out the door like I have seen, but there was enough of a line for people behind and in front of us to complain incessantly. The staff is prepared for the long lines, so if you can't deal with waiting and sitting next to strangers, do us all a favor and eat somewhere else.  Four of us first-timers went for lunch yesterday - and it was tip top. I've always been a pulled pork guy but I went brisket and it was a very wise choice.

2012-02-27,2.0,"cold food + awkward seating = Smoque did not live up to my expectations. I went here last night after hearing great things about the place. When we first walked in there was a sign warning that they would run out of pulled pork soon. Seeing as this is what I came to eat, it was pretty annoying that they would run out of one of their most popular items. When we did get to the register, it took them awhile, but they decided they had enough pulled pork left for one sandwich. I was happy that I was going to be able to eat! After ordering my boyfriend and I were seated very quickly, but I was squished between a pair of Chicago police officers and an overweight couple. So this was annoying and awkward. Holding a conversation was difficult being in such close proximity to the other people, and being bumped by the man next to me multiple times made it even worse. Now I know why they can seat people so quickly- no one wants to stay and eat when it means you are forced into dining 3 inches away from complete strangers.  Once my food came, I was just looking forward to eating. But, my sandwich was cold. Cold pulled pork is disgusting!!! Obviously, this was very disappointing. Since the place is so crowded as rushed, and they had ran out of pulled pork, asking them to fix it seemed unlikely.  Overall, if Smoque would have served me a good meal I could have gotten over the other annoyances, but when you can't even serve me my (overpriced) sandwich at an acceptable temperature, you fail. PS- Don't order small ala carte sides. What a joke! For $2.25 I got about 2 tablespoons of mac and cheese. Lame. (At least that was hot though.)",-0.9841,0.787,0.063,0.15,0.5825609756097562

That always helps :) The food is flat out amazing. I had the brisket platter with fries and mac and cheese. It was so good. The brisket was so tender it fell apart when I was trying to stab it with a fork...maybe I should have used a spoon to dip it in the awesome sauce! The mac and cheese was perfect--not too creamy, cheese, or runny. Seriously awesome. The fries may have been some of the best I have had. I got my standard ketchup, salt, pepper---I didn't use any of it really. They were perfect.  I did use one packet of ketchup to mix with the BBQ sauce and dip with the fries, that was excellent--but not necessary. And the coleslaw is delicious.

These ribs had an extremely smokey flavor which if you like is good. The dry rub left me so parched that I was chugging water well into the night. Mac n cheese was ok, but wouldn't say it was out of this world. Corn bread was okay but I like my corn bread sweeter. Fries were good but pretty plain. Pulled pork was good but a touch dry.

2012-02-23,5.0,"I just visited a Texas BBQ place this week, which reminded that I better get this review in. And, let me tell you, you WANT to hear about this place. Wowser! This is literally effing fantastic BBQ! No, better than that...BBQ nirvana! Yep, nirvana about describes it. You have GOT to go!! Let me give you a few logistics before I talk about the crazy good food. First, you need to BYOB, so go by Trader Joe's or Binny's or Whole Foods and buy beer. Get a good micro-brew because this place deserves it.  Second, go EARLY! They sell out. Having been there many, many times, I can tell you that they sell out often of the good stuff.  Third, don't let the line scare you. They move that line pretty quick. Yes, the darn line goes out the door and down the block sometimes, and, while I hate waiting, I always beg my hubby to let us stand in this line. Even in the winter, and if you knew how much I hate, hate, hate the Chi-town winters, you would understand what a sacrifice that is for me.  The place will usually be PACKED when you finally get in the door. But, don't worry. They will find a table for you by the time your order is ready. Just go ahead and place your order, stand where they tell you to and the owner will tell you when and where to sit. Just do it. It's a privilege to be in there. Now, the food. I'll start with a disclaimer, as a native South Floridian, I didn't really know good BBQ from bad. I mean, we're known for not knowing how to vote, and not for our BBQ. But I married a Texan. (Yeah, girls, be jealous, they know how to grow them in Texas.) And, my Texan knows BBQ. So, an endorsement from him is a big deal. He LOVES this place. They make this beef brisket by smoking long and low. It gets this lovely smoke ring all around, and the flavor is to die for. Then they get their sausages from Mikeska's. Texans will know what that means because Mikeska's is a Texas institution. They know their sausage. And, Smoque gets it from them. (The sausage is a big sellout early in the evening, so try before 7 pm for that). And, the cornbread! Oh, man! Sweet but not like cake. Moist. With little pieces of real corn. Love it. Then, they make their baked beans in house. With their own recipe. And they put chopped beef brisket in the baked beans! Oh, my stomach growls and my mouth waters just writing about it. Chi-town, how I will miss those beans! The hubby likes the mac and cheese. He's a big mac and cheese eater and he likes the one made here. Lastly, one of the owners is usually in the kitchen, while the other one helps keep the line flowing smoothly and the seating arranged.  Just go! You won't regret it!

Don't believe me ... ask my friends and co-workers.  I introduced some co-workers and it now has a cult following in the office.  It's a special treat!  We will send 2 people out to retrieve the orders as it takes about 20 mins. each way.  We had to limit how many people we ask otherwise we are bringing boxes of food back. One of the managers brings it in as a special thank you for teams working on special projects.  I take my out of town guest here and every time they return, they insist that we go to Smoque.  I'm starting to think they come for Smoque more so than to visit me.  The staff is wonderful!  The parking situation isn't the greatest but if you are anywhere near the L, take the blue line, the Irving Park stop is very close.  A short walk about a block away.  Yes, the lines can be long at times but I have never been disappointed.  It is definitely worth the wait!!

A note about the line & wait time: We were a party of 3 and went at prime time on a Friday night.  The line was clear to the door and every single table was occupied.  We figured we were screwed and there was no way on earth we would end up getting a table - but we were wrong.  I don't know how they manage to do it, but somehow each and every group we saw was seated immediately upon ordering.  I'll chalk it up to BBQ magic.",0.7165,0.8,0.112,0.087,0.4927437641723356

They remove the translucent skin underneath the rib, hate when places don't do that. Hugs the bone gently, doesn't fall off the bone (that's a no-no, again for you newbs). Sliced brisket, that's one BIG OHHH YEAHHH! Masterfully cooked with and almost pillowy texture. No sauce needed. Pulled pork's good, but I'd prefer a vinegar based sauce for PP (can't all get what we want though).  We forgot to order the Texas sausage, nooooooooo.... The sides. Coleslaw is one of the best.

After some strategizing, we put in a big order for our party of five, accounting for three of us who already had bellies full of hot dogs.  We ordered brisket, a half rack of St. Louis style ribs, a taste of pulled pork, and a sausage, with sides of cole slaw, BBQ beans, brisket chili, macaroni and cheese, and cornbread, and a little peach cobbler for dessert.  This feast, about enough to feed three hungry people, cost a little over $40 with sodas. Everything was delicious.  The ribs were smokey and very tender, but meaty enough to give a satisfying resistance when I sank in my teeth.  They were painted in sauce, but not drenched, so the flavor of the meat remained supreme.  The pulled pork was superb, moist and flavorful, smoked for hours and pulled apart by hand.  The brisket was not quite as good as the first two, but this was just preference - it was faultless, with a delicate texture usually reserved for fattier cuts of meat.  The sausage was great, thick and full of flavor and spices, with a good level of snap.  We got two barbecue sauces to slather on our meats as we pleased.  One was thicker and sweeter, the other a bit runnier with a vinegar tang.  Both were delicious, and I actually loved mixing them together. The sides were as impressive as the meat, and they made our barbecue session into a complete feast.  I loved the mac and cheese.  It was very cheesy with a touch of creaminess and a nice crispy topping of bread crumbs.  The beans were among some of the best I've had, full of flavor with a far cooked but toothsome texture.  The brisket chili was likewise fantastic, deeply comforting with nice shreds of meat.  The cole slaw was the only light side on the table, and it was refreshingly easy on the mayo, with crisp clean flavors to cut through the smoke and fat of our meal.  The cornbread was the one side I stopped eating after a bite.  Not bad, but not good, a little hard and a little short on butter. We finished with the mini peach cobbler, and I wouldn't leave without tasting this tiny $2.25 treat.  It was more of a crumble than a cobbler, mostly peaches and sugar under a little bit of crunchy crust.  It was sweet and fruity, with a softened fruit texture.  A couple spoonfuls made a nice cap to a meaty meal. I admit I'm no expert, but Smoque provided some of the best barbecue I've had in recent memory.  It was comforting and delicious, and if it were in my town, I'd take advantage of it as often as my body allowed.",0.9994,0.713,0.255,0.032,0.6231735159817352

2012-01-22,4.0,"This past Saturday, my husband and myself had the priviledged of joining my brother and his wife and my father for a meal at Smoque. I had never heard of it before but was excited to try to down-home cookin'.  Upon entering, you will have to order first then you will be seated. We were in a little bit of a line but it went quickly. Our orders were fulfilled within 5 minutes or so which I also thought was nice and speedy, considering the place was pretty much full. I ordered the pulled pork ala carte with a side of the cornbread. I have to say that the pork without any additional sauce would have been just fine but once you add in the sauce, WOW! It was delicious! The pork was moist and the sauce was so flavorful. I also very much enjoyed the cornbread and actually saw some kernels of corn inside which made me appreciate the flavor even more. My husband ordered the same pulled pork but I do believe SOMETHING must be said about how amazing the mac and cheese is. No joke, it's amazing. If we ever venture back to Smoque, I will be ordering that M&C because it has this lovely crumble layer on top like a panko bread crumb and it's so cheesy! I also tried my brother's brisket which was delicious. I did not try the ribs but they looked great, too! Overall, our experience was great, I would definitely recommend this location for a lunch if you're in the area. Only downside would be parking but even when it was busy and snow was everywhere making parking difficult we still found a spot within a few minutes.

There still was a line but it moves well and if you're eating in, they really do an excellent job of finding a table for your party by the time you've placed your order.  I didn't think the family style seating was for me, but I quickly got over it just knowing we didn't have to scramble to find a seat that's so cool. And there was the food. The baby backs are excellent, never tough or drowning in sauce, it's served on the side, they're seasoned well and have the right amount of pink on the inside. The slaw is excellent, not that store bought crap that's been made days in advance and swimming in mayo. The BBQ beans, Mac and Cheese, Bag of cut fries, and cobbler.

Both were good, and I would order the chopped brisket again, but the pulled pork just didn't taste too great. Their amazing spicy bbq sauce made up for this, however the meat doesn't stand out on it's own. Their sides are pretty delicious. I enjoyed their cole slaw, which held back on the mayo in favor of vinegar, a big plus in my book. Their mac and cheese was good, however I wish I would've ordered their fries, which on the plate next to me looked delicious!

A cup of BBQ sauce is served on the side for you to slather your meat the way you like it.  Choose Regular or Spicy sauce. * Side dishes come in portion cups perfect for one person. (You wouldn't want to share anyway, they taste so good!)  I especially like the MAC AND CHEESE (creamy cheese sauce topped with crunchy breadcrumbs) and the PEACH COBBLER (sweet peaches with a caramelized crust). * COLESLAW comes with every platter and has a light vinegar dressing.  The coleslaw alone is no show-stopper, but its crunchy texture and mild flavor provides the contrast needed to support the meat and sides.   WAIT-TIME and DINE-IN SERVICE: A line ran out the door during during the our entire visit (Friday night dinner).  From waiting in line to sitting down to eat, we only waited a 1/2 hour.  Smoque was managing the seating process, so there was no pressure in racing to save tables which was a HUGE PLUS.   RESTAURANT SIZE: The place is really tight. The line runs out the door and there is no area to wait for your order.  Tables are jam packed, so it is difficult to dine-in with a large group or if you have kids that need to move around.

2011-12-29,5.0,"Going to Smoque for BBQ is like going to the south side for blues. As a white, middle class suburban kid, this is an adventure! Fortunately, they're about 6 inches off of the Kennedy on Pulaski, so that's lowers the anxiety a bit. But then you pull in and the street seems full of signs that basically say, ""If you're a Smoque customer, don't even THINK of parking here!"" In fact, I think some of the signs said EXACTLY that. But after a bit of roaming around, we found a parking spot that didn't appear to have a ""TOW ZONE"" sign in effect -- at that moment. With that friendly neighborhood greeting, we walked into Smoque. It's nothing special to look at on the outside, and not much better inside. There's a wall-covering blackboard with the menu, but it's starting to fade out, making it hard for noobs like us to decipher. Fortunately, my brother is a regular here, so I didn't need the menu. Even at 1:30pm on a Wednesday afternoon, the place is jammed. The line is not out the door, and that's something. We order, a kid on the floor asks uhow many are in our party, and what our order numbers are. Every table is jammed and it looks like we're going to eat standing up. 15 minutes or less later, as the kitchen nears our number, the kid shows us to 4 seats, conveniently located in the corner and near the pop machine --perfect for me! 3 minutes later, our food comes out. I order the sweet jalapenos and head back to the table. My first mouthful of chopped brisket is, well, awesome! Lots of smoke, crunchy crust, great beef taste, subtle complex BBQ sauce and perfect moisture. Cole slaw and fries are both really good, as are the beans. I agree with my bro -- the brisket is the choice here, but my wife's pulled pork sandwich was great -- and the 1/2 sandwich was just the right size for her appetite. We didn't feel rushed, even with 30+ people standing in the aisles waiting for a table.

I've always been a fan of ribs, but ever since moving from Texas to California, I've never had a good slab of ribs that could compare. Anywhere. One of the three criteria were always off. Smoque BBQ on the other hand gets it done with flying colors.  The flavor of the ribs could stand on its own, even without sauce. The texture isn't chewy and falls off the bone with one meek chomp. And now, the sauce... married with the ribs, it's pure perfection. The sauce has just the right amount of spice and the right amount of tang. It would be a sin to let a drop go to waste, and honestly it could probably stand on it's own in a glass with a silly straw. Now that's a nice rack.

Brisket: THE BEST brisket I've ever had. I'm wary of saying anything is the best in the city because I don't really plan to visit enough places for that statement to carry statistical value. However, it was amazingly tender and moist and melted in my mouth. I thought the portion was fair considering that BBQ is usually expensive. Next time I will probably just buy a straight pound of this stuff and forgo all the other food distractors.  Mac&Cheese: I have to preface this by saying I'm not a big mac&cheese kinda guy. I never did the blue box stuff growing up, so cheese covered macaroni doesn't really bring up childhood memories. The mac&cheese here is baked and adequate, which is about as good as mac&cheese gets for me.  Peach Cobbler: Again, no childhood connections for me. I thought it was pretty good.  Overall, I considered Smoque a great value, which is really hard to find in a BBQ place in a major city... actually, it's probably because I'm a cheap bastard and I don't think many places offer good value ^_^ I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere here and their commitment to amazing brisket.

The place is a picturebook playland of Americana indulgence.   Sitting next to us were two groups competing for our attention: (1) a group of happy ladies practically pouring hot sauce in each other's mouths; and (2) a table of foodies proudly displayed Half Acre growlers.  This place has become a destination and people make an event out of it. The food here is delicious, but I have a couple tips-worth of advice.   First, if you don't want to deal with the out-the-door line (especially in the winter) order take-out 45 minutes prior to your arrival.  It'll help you make a quick getaway.   Second, if you're real hungry and debating between the platter and the sandwich meal options, go for the sandwich and add the sides.  My platter portions were noticeably short-shrifted, meat-wise, in comparison to the sandwich options. One more thing - my palette may not be refined, but barbeque isn't the most demanding of dishes.  As I see it, the difference comes in two basic angles: the smoke flavor of the meat and the taste of the sauce.  Smoque delivers a nice cedar flavored pork sandwich and a citrusy barbeque sauce.  There's a lot of hype here, but you'll probably walk away satisfied with your meal.",0.958,0.898,0.095,0.006,0.5375
2011-11-26,5.0,"Now I have two favorite BBQ joints in Chicagoland. When I'm on the North side it will definitely be Smoque again. Let's start with the meats. I had the Rib Combo (both Baby Back and St. Louis). They were cooked to perfection. As a BBQ Judge I have become very spoiled with perfect ribs, and these are perfect ribs. The meat comes cleanly off the bone where you bite, but it does not ""fall off the bone"" when you take a bite. The bone dries immediately. That's a perfectly cooked rib. As for flavor, it was fabulous. I asked for the sauce on the side so that I could taste the meat, and it was heavenly. I added some sauce and it just made me happy. Both the Baby Back and the St. Louis ribs are awesome. My wife had the sliced Brisket. It, too was awesome. Just a little on the dry side, but nothing to complain about. She, too, had the sauce on the side, and if they would have put the sauce on the meat, it would have been perfect.  The sides are great. We had Mac n' Cheese, Brisket Chili and Cornbread. The Slaw comes with the meal, too. They were all awesome. Mac n' Cheese was very cheesy, creamy, and not overcooked like many establishments. The Brisket Chili is almost as good as mine (seriously that is awesome Chili). Heavy on the Brisket, light on the beans. The Cornbread was sweet and moist, and delicious. And now the Slaw. Normally I like creamy Slaw, but this Slaw was fabulous. Sweet vinegar with red onions and cabbage. Simple, and simply divine.  One thing I really like about both of my favorite 'Que places in town is the fact that the owners take an interest in the customers. Barry was out working the crowd, he apologized when our meal was taking a little longer than he liked. He followed up with everyone in the place, and when I asked for a little Pulled Pork to go, he got me some. All in all it was a very great visit. Now to that Pulled Pork. We live about 45 minutes away, so I knew the pork would be cold, but oh, how heavenly. The perfect amount of smoke, still very juicy, and tender. Again, not overcooked.  Oh, and Saturday night at 5:00 in the rain didn't deter anyone. The place was packed. I will be back. I will definitely be back.",0.9993,0.699,0.286,0.016,0.6612433862433862

Their macaroni and cheese is pretty damn good, the chili with brisket is good as well. The beans are great as is the cornbread. I'm not a fan of the vinegar-y and onion-y coleslaw though.

The coleslaw especially since it's my favorite type--cabbage and onions in a light, slightly sweetened vinegar dressing with just a bit of celery seeds. Simple, delicious and a great contrast to all the other rich flavors.  I'd give this place 5 stars, but I have nothing to compare it to, especially nothing authentic.

I had the sliced beef brisket sandwich.  The beef brisket had very little flavor.  It did have a small smoke ring around it, but the smoke flavor and rub never saturated the beef.  It also was fatty (fat makes me gag, so the 3-star rating, which should be 2.5.)  The BBQ sauce was thin and didn't have much flavor.  The meat was sliced thicker than I'm used to, but was very tender and falling apart.  I think the fat made it juicy.  So if you like fat, you may like it. My friend had the pulled pork sandwich, and told me that it definitely wasn't the best he's had.   The coleslaw was excellent.  The chili side dish was also very good. Portions were plentiful, but we compared it to other BBQ restaurants we went to in the suburbs, and didn't think Smoque's lives up to its reputation.  Atmosphere is nice for a city restaurant.  Parking isn't easy because of permit parking in the neighborhood (OK, I'm spoiled living in the suburbs!!)  The staff was very nice and attentive. We were disappointed to spend $20.00 for lunch without drinks, and not thoroughly enjoy it. By the way, I've been to Austin, TX several times and have had the BBQ there.  No comparison.  Meat there was smoked throughout, flavor was throughout the meat and the BBQ sauce was delicious.    Maybe we hit it on an off-day?  However, I don't think we'll try it again.  We have several BBQ places closer to home that we think are better.",0.9782,0.787,0.137,0.076,0.608525641025641
2011-10-10,4.0,"Having lived in Austin, Texas, and experienced the BBQ of the Hill Country, I feel it is hard to find good BBQ. I think Smoque does a pretty decent job of bringing good BBQ to Chicago - in my opinion, a town that sorely needs decent BBQ. The food is always fresh and inexpensive. Over four of five trips, I have tried both styles of ribs, the brisket, and the pulled pork. I think the brisket still needs work. It lacks the deep smoke ring you see at places like Ruby's or Smokey Moe's or the Salt Lick in the Austin area. It is also a little dry. The pit masters of the Hill Country seem to be able to smoke brisket for 24 hours and have it emerge with a perfect consistency of smoke, moisture, and texture. I think if Smoque continues to work on their technique, they will eventually start getting better quality brisket. The other thing I wonder is where they're getting their brisket from? The meat is good quality but it doesn't seem to be the highest quality you might find in the BBQ meccas. Lastly, I think they add a little too much brine to the brisket, therefore detracting from the smoke. What the brisket might lack, I think the pulled pork makes up for. I really love the pulled pork here and think it is their most consistent and well-done dish. The pork is succulent and moist, with just the right amount of crust. The sauce at Smoque is excellent with the pork, with the vinegar base serving as a perfect contrast for the sweetness of the pork. The large white rolls they serve their sandwiches on are perfect for soaking up a good amounts of BBQ sauce.  I've tried both styles of ribs and am leaning towards the dry rub Memphis-style ribs. Just like the brisket, I still think they need a little more smoke. But, they go extremely well with the sweet sauce they serve them with. If you go, you have to try to mac n' cheese as a side, it is delicious, with a hard crust of cheese on top that opens up to a hot, creamy interior. The beans and fries are pretty good and the slaw could use a little work.  All in all, I think they do a good job and will likely get better with time. A legendary pit master in Omaha, Jerry, one of the owner's of Fojay's Pit Bar-B-Que, once told me that most smokers don't develop character until you've used them for a few years. I know I'll keep on checking out Smoque, because it is by far the best I've had in Chicago. Parking at Smoque can be a challenge and it is often crowded, but we've never had to wait for more than a few minutes for a table. The decor is basic, but I'd be worried if it were anything more for a place serving BBQ. The staff is friendly, and one of the owners is often walking through the restaurant inquiring about what people think about the food - a good sign as I think they genuinely want to make their BBQ better each day.",0.9984,0.807,0.179,0.015,0.5917692939244666

In short, we ordered everything on the menu and everything was absolutely delicious.  The brisket was juicy and smokey, though unfortunately, we ordered the sandwich, which soaked up most of the moisture; order the platter.  The pulled pork was moist, soft and had just the right amount of sauce.  The ribs were perfectly done.  My personal favorite were the baby backs, which had the right combination of smoke and sweetness.  I don't think we used the sauce more than once.  The Texas sausage was a bit underwhelming, but went better with the sauce than the ribs did. The best part of the evening was that, near the end of our meal, another couple asked us (very politely) if we were almost done, so they could have our seat (the place was very packed and there was a line outside the door for seating).  Apparently, the staff thought that their intrusion was worth giving us 2 free peach cobblers to go, even though we did not complain or show any hint of being offended.  This is service at its best.

Cabby looked at me like I was crazy when we got picked up downtown and said where we wanted to go. Take the Blue Line, it stops nearby and is way cheaper. My girlfriend and I waited in the long line for about 20 minutes. Too bad we didn't know you can bring in beer and just drink while in line or I'd have hit up a party store. She got the brisket, I got one of the varieties of ribs. A co-owner was there and overheard me mentioning we were out-of-towners. He hooked me up with some free pulled pork and the other variety of ribs I did not order. 5 stars already! The brisket was Godlike. I've never had better brisket. And my girlfriend doesn't care for BBQ. She devoured it with a smile on her face that I'll probably never see again unless we return.  Both styles of ribs were amazing, very flavorful. A lot of people mess up ribs by making them taste like 90% smoke and 10% meat. These were perfect. Can't remember which type was fattier (St. Louis maybe?) but I preferred the less fat ribs. Pulled pork was pretty damn tasty too. Don't recall too much about its flavor but I know it was good. All the sides were amazing. Cole slaw and cornbread stand out as two of the better options.

We stopped in on a Friday afternoon and walked right up to the counter, ordered from a very friendly young man and grabbed a table after filling our cups with some sweet tea (which is a must with southern barbeque). Shortly thereafter our number was called and we dug in. We sampled a bit of everything with the exception of the peach cobbler, ribs and chicken.  I chose the brisket, brisket chili (lay off me, I spent my formative years in Texas and I love brisket) and fries as my sides. My dining companions went with the pulled pork, cornbread and macaroni and cheese and the brisket and Texas sausage, baked beans and cornbread.  The brisket was delicious. It was juicy and surrounded by the most flavorful bark. It was so good, I let it go sauce-less.  The Texas sausage is another matter. On its own, it's good. It's spicy. But, it needs the sauce. It's almost as if it was made to pair with Smoque's sauce because when you put the two together, it's barbeque bliss.  The pulled pork was melt-in-your-mouth good.  But, I'm glad I chose the brisket.  And the sides were amazing!  The brisket chili is Texas chili at its finest. It was so well-seasoned and chock full of brisket, beans and tomatoes. I wanted to take a quart of it home so that I could slip into something more comfortable and get in some alone time with it.  The cornbread was sweet and savory, with kernels of corn throughout, and perfect for sopping up every last bit of the sauce from my plate.  The baked beans were super tasty but paled in comparison to the chili.  Now, I do not go out of my way for macaroni and cheese but Smoque has me singing a different tune. It was rich and topped with bread crumbs. It was so good your granny would be tempted to ask for the recipe.  Let us not forget the coleslaw that comes with all the platters. It's just cabbage and vinegar (apple cider vinegar maybe?) and perhaps some seasoning but it is fantastic. It's clean and simple and it pairs perfectly with richness of the meats. I loved it, loved it, loved it.  And the sauce is divine. It's the love child of Memphis barbeque sauce and Texas barbeque sauce. It's vinegary and spicy and the stuff Smoque makes will stay there forever if you dare to get it under your nails...

2011-08-19,5.0,"There's just something about less-than-kosher Chicago restaurants operated by Jews; maybe it's true love that drives them to the forbidden fruit, or maybe it requires a necessary dealing with the devil to get into the business, but in my experience, my fellow tribal Chicagoans do excellent things with treyf. First Hot Doug's, and now Smoque. We arrived at ~7:40 PM on a Thursday, and the line was just barely out the door, which is always a good sign. Our food was ready before 8:10; despite the sea of humanity in this establishment, you still probably eat quicker after entry than at a sit-down BBQ restaurant. Every last morsel was divine. The pulled pork was moist yet surprisingly lean, without an atom of gristle to be found. The ribs had the telltale pink ring of meat just beneath the surface that signifies an expertly-smoked rack. The texas sausage was tender and spicy. And then there's the brisket. I apologize if you have a Jewish grandmother, because this is better than hers. It is perfectly seasoned and smoked to perfection, tender while still retaining its meatiness and shape. The side dishes (fries, corn bread, BBQ baked beans, mac and cheese, corn bread) were all delectable; it was clear that effort had been put into them, which is unusual for a barbecue place, especially a good one.  Halfway through the meal I was preparing this yelp review, and realized that there was one thing that would hold Smoque away from a 5 star review: the sauce. This being a Chicago establishment, it was no surprise that the sauce was too thick and saccharine, as my fellow natives have an inexplicable penchant for cloying, barely-more-than-ketchup barbecue sauces. Still, I could not forgive this very average sauce; I wanted a sauce that packed more vinegar punch, with less tomato and a heck of a lot more heat. A fellow patron overheard my gripe, and informed me that they carried a spicy sauce in addition to the regular offering; I immediately went to the counter and picked up a sauce that (surprise) packed more vinegar punch, with less tomato, and a heck of a lot more heat. There went my lone complaint. I guess I could take off a star because the woman who took my order forgot to ask me if I wanted mild or spicy, but this meal left me in such a state of ecstasy that I'd feel like a scrooge if I did so.",0.9945,0.822,0.144,0.034,0.4668309294871794

2011-08-15,5.0,"Another review, another 5 stars for Smoque. It's been over a week since we came here for lunch and I'm still raving about how awesome Smoque is. We knew going in that this place served up some great BBQ, but it was above and beyond anything I expected. Coming off fresh from a BBQ disaster elsewhere (review to come), I was a bit skeptical. Could it be possible to eat BBQ without fat oozing everywhere and feeling like a disgusting glutton? The answer is YES! Atmosphere: We were prepared for a long wait and were pleasantly surprised at how quick the line was moving. I think it helped that additional seating was available in the outdoor patio.  Cleanliness definitely caught my eye. Also, it was nice that the staff take on the task of finding you a seat after you order. It not only helps to avoid confrontations for ""seat saving"" for instance, but also helps to keep things moving. Food: I ordered the half &half with one side. This sandwich gives you the best of both worlds and is perfect for someone like me that can never make a decision. One half of the sandwich was of the brisket while the other half was of the pulled pork.  Brisket - deliciously moist and tender. Be sure to order it sliced since it's a bit juicier than the chopped. Pulled pork - More of the same awesomeness. I was amazed at how little fat at all (if any) was on any of the meat.  The BBQ sauce - the perfect mix of spicy, tangy, smoked BBQ. Yum! I really like how they give you a separate container of it which is perfect for dipping. I substituted the coleslaw for corn bread (YES!) and got the side of fries. The fries were huge; enough to feed at least 3 people. The corn bread was good - even had real corn bits in it. Service: Friendly service, despite a very fast-paced atmosphere.  Another plus for having free soft drink refills and an endless supply of napkins at each table.  We can't wait for our next trip here. We also are hoping to be able to have Smoque cater an event for us in the near future it's THAT good!",0.9973,0.726,0.218,0.056,0.5479012345679013

2011-08-10,2.0,"This is a review of Smoque BBQ, and to a lesser extent - a review of the Food Network show ""Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives."" Reason being, because DDD is the reason I went to Smoque in the first place. I grew up in Texas, so when a Texan buddy of mine was in town visiting me in Chicago he told me he had seen this Smoque BBQ place on DDD and we should definitely try it out. Texas BBQ? Profiled on Food Network? Sounded like a no-brainer and we were excited about trying it out. It was an unusually hot and muggy June day (very Texas like), so the scene was set for a little reminder of home. Or at least that was the thought process... Smoque proves that just because something is profiled on Food Network, doesn't mean it's good. Or even adequate. Food Network jumped the shark on food integrity long ago. I'd estimate somewhere between The Next Food Network Star and Cupcake Wars. Thank God for Alton Brown - perhaps their only saving grace. Anyway - the food at Smoque was barely just ok. I'm no BBQ purist, but I will say I've been to numerous good AND crappy BBQ joints during my life, and Smoque would have trouble holding their own amidst the ""crappy"" category. Very sub-par for something featured on the Food Network.  The sauce - often the crown jewel of a famous BBQ joint - was forgettable. Our group of four each ordered different meats and sides so we could share and get a more comprehensive tasting. We were all disappointed to say the least. The disappointment was severe considering the journey we took to get there (because of construction on some EL lines, we had to take two trains, a bus, and eventually a cab to get there). The food was hardly worth our Odyssey.  Oh, and did I mention Smoque gave me food poisoning? I was sick for 3 days after eating there, effectively ruining a long weekend with friends in town. Now, I am a fan of the CONCEPT of ""Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives."" This, because of my general disdain for chain restaurants and my love of great little-known mom-and-pop places. I do a fair bit of travel for my job and if I was limited to Chilis and Applebees for all my meals I would lose my mind. But Food Network really does its viewers a disservice by featuring places like Smoque. They get away with it because they figure most viewers are unlikely to actually go to most of the places featured, and you can't taste or smell food through the TV set. Guy Fiere, albeit a decent TV host, is certainly no chef of record and all he does is kiss up to these places he features. He never plays the role of true critic, automatically discounting just about everything he features. Not to mention his abortion of a Sushi/BBQ (con)fusion restaurant, Tex Wasabi. Anyone stupid enough to fuse BBQ and Sushi has respect for neither BBQ or sushi. And he should really be ashamed of himself. But the Food Network is the machine which gives people like Fiere a voice to lead us all astray in our cullinary pursuits. So to summerize: Smoque BBQ - SKIP IT.

The sides (corn bread, (vinegar) slaw & peach cobbler) were just ""OK"", by comparison. The corn bread was tasty without applying butter, but nothing to write home about. The Peach Cobbler was OK, but I think that I was in the mood because reflecting back (1 hour ago), there wasn't anything that really stood out. I'm not a big fan of vinegar slaw, in general, that being said, this was well prepared, good proportions of pepper, cabbage & vinegar (I ate it all). My wife had the brisket it was also very well seasoned & cooked (I got to taste). The brisket sauce was different than the BBQ sauce that came with the ribs and was tasty (IMHO). She liked her Mac & Cheese, which she is very picky about. Given the ""atmosphere"" & seating accommodations, I was a little surprised that it was over $30 for two dinners. That being said, the food came up (#1) reasonably quick and the table was cleared inoffensively. Smoque is near the top of my heap for casual bar-b-q.",0.9885,0.809,0.17,0.022,0.5182098765432099
2011-08-03,4.0,"When I evaluate barbecue joints on the North Side, I feel like my experience with baklava is relevant.   The first time I had baklava was in Istanbul.  Not only was it authentic baklava in the most beautiful city in Turkey, but it was from the chef that's renowned from making the best baklava in the world.  It was amazing.  UHMAZING.  The result?  All other baklava tastes like shit to me.     Similarly, I never even tried pork until I hit my twenties.  I grew up in a vegetarian family, and occasionally had poultry or fish.  And I had never had ribs until I came to Chicago - and it just so happens that I was living in the south side and ended up trying it at joints like Uncle John's, Lem's, BK - in fact, the south side is filled with amazing barbecue joints.   The lesson I'm trying to convey is this: when you try something for the first time, don't get the very best.  Its setting you up for a world of disappointment. That said, the ribs from Smoque are what I would describe as SOLID.  They were perfectly done and delicious.  Not very saucy, not particularly flavorful - the menu suggested St. Louis for the ""authentic experience,"" but they were out and we got baby back.  It's a little pricey for what you get, and they charge extra for bread. It didn't capture my heart the way Uncle John's has, but it's close to my apartment, and no one in the neighborhood looks at me and assumes I'm there to buy drugs. It's not a friendly neighborhood joint  - the young lady who took my order didn't even look at me and none of the customers chat in line, but they were perfectly courteous.   Since, as I said, I didn't try pork until I became an adult, I get a very minor stomach discomfort when I eat it - which means I only eat it when it's REALLY fucking good.  Smoque doesn't quite warrant the discomfort, but I'm going to be honest - if  I had never tried Uncle John's or Lem's, I'd probably give Smoque five stars.",0.9937,0.773,0.167,0.059,0.5691176470588237

I also wish the menu offered more combination options, although it IS nice that you can order a ""taste"" of various meats for ~$3 (and they're pretty generous tastes). But really, overall it's very good. The baby back ribs were a little small, which was fine, and nicely cooked. The pulled pork and sliced brisket had excellent flavors, and the smokiness was balanced without being overwhelming. Parts of the brisket were really fatty, but it was a normal, not weird/gristly, fat. The texas sausage was my least favorite meat, although it wasn't bad. The chili with brisket was tasty but plain, and the macaroni and cheese was probably the best thing I had, and I'm not sure if that is a good or bad sign.

The sauce on the meats was good (seemed like the same sauce no matter what you ordered). Here's my issue. The smoke seemed fake. It tasted like they used smoked flavorings in their sauce rather than actually smoking the food. I could be wrong, but that is what it tasted like. Their website says otherwise of course, everything in this place is smoked and everything is smoked using varied woods depending on the dish (they expertly chose the right flavor combinations). I don't know, I've been in a few chili-cook-offs that had contestants with very apparent smoke-flavoring and that's what my meal here reminded me of. I had the beef brisket that was incredibly tender, but it wasn't very flavorful on areas that the sauce had not touched. I'm okay with this now that i know I must be equipped with enough sauce. Fiance had the chicken and I am incredibly glad they didn't overcook it. I hate overcooked chicken. It was cooked well, moist and fell off the bone. Again, the sauce issue, but the chicken did have it's own flavor. Forgot to mention that I would return if I'm craving BBQ and if we're too lazy to make it ourselves.

The place itself is not very big and there was already a line out the door at 6pm but the line does move pretty quick. I do like you order and pay first at the counter then they seat you. It is not fast food style but not a traditional sit down where they come to your table and take your order. I think this turns the tables over faster. I got the half and half which is a half pulled pork and half brisket. The brisket you have a choice of chopped or sliced. I wish I would have gotten the whole sandwich chopped brisket because it was really good. The pulled pork was good too but not as impressive as the brisket. I also go the recommended BBQ baked beans and they were really good. The slaw was good too.

I was greeted by a line out the door, which I bypassed since I ordered ahead for takeout (recommended). The line looked like it was moving quickly; I'd guess people were waiting about 20 minutes to order at 7pm on a Friday, and there were a few tables open for people to sit down. The cafeteria-style seating looked serviceable, but Smoque clearly isn't a destination for its atmosphere. I sampled the pulled pork, links, and brisket. They were out of St. Louis-style ribs. A sign over the register indicated that they had been having quality control issues.  The pulled pork was excellent. Not as juicy as I would've liked, but very good nonetheless, with a deep, flavorful bark. The meat was slightly sweet, with a good amount of smoke. Not the best pulled pork I've had in the city, but definitely up there. I usually shy away from BBQ beef in Chicago; we're a pork town. However, the links and brisket were both outstanding. Honestly, the first BBQ beef I've had in Chicago that I would order again. The links had a great snap to the casing, with a spicy, peppery, floral top-note over the sweet beef. Just outstanding quality meat, very juicy.  The brisket was the first I've had outside of Austin that I enjoyed. Very, very tender and juicy, with a healthy amount of smoke throughout. Not too fatty, but not nearly as mealy as some of the leaner briskets I've had before. Great bark, as well. The only real let-down was the sauce. A cloying, citrusy mess. Like a mix between OJ concentrate and molasses. The meat was good enough that I enjoyed all of it without sauce, but I was surprised by the sauce. Seemed like they were trying to do something unique instead of just making a quality complement to the meat. Summary: Not my favorite BBQ joint in the city (around 71st Street is still the standard), but definitely one of the better options out there. Outstanding beef options in a pork-obsessed town. Ate my food with a good rauchbier. Smoky goodness.",0.999,0.7,0.28,0.02,0.5693380614657211
2011-07-01,5.0,"Absolutely the best smoked brisket I've ever had anywhere in the country! It's so tender it can be cut with a fork, and it's wonderfully flavorful.  So smoky!!!  The rub they use is also fantastic.  Then when you add the vinegar based bbq sauce, it's a combination of flavor made in heaven. The mac and cheese is also to die for.  They start with creamy mac & cheese in a small tin cup.

2011-06-28,5.0,"My recent craving for everything BBQ led us to Smoque on our recent visit to Chicago. The tiny corner shop had a line out the door when we arrived, which moved fast, but was just long enough for us to have a contentious debate about what combination of ribs/brisket/pork and sides to order. If only they offered an ""everything"" sampler!  We settled on the baby back ribs (the St. Louis ribs weren't available that night) with BBQ beans and mac and cheese for the sides, and added the sampler portion of the sliced brisket. Even though it seemed every inch of the place was full, we were led to an empty section of the table immediately after ordering.  We had our food within minutes and our first taste of the extra smoky BBQ beans had us wishing we could get a bucket of them.  Not that we would have had room with the substantial portion of ribs, brisket and the thick and creamy mac and cheese with a generous topping of crunchy crumbs. Even though I ate more than I should have, I kept sneaking a peak at the tiny side of individually baked peach cobbler on the tray next to me wishing I could just sneak a taste.

2011-06-23,4.0,"A little while back I was researching BBQ joints in the city when I came across Smoque.  It had a ton of great reviews and had been featured on Guy Fieri's ""Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives"".  (You can see the segment here.)  It looked pretty darn good so I thought I should probably give it a go. What I learned from the show is that the guy that opened this place had little restaurant experience and no professional cooking experience.  He was just an IT guy who decided he'd ""rather make ribs"".  So he and a couple of his buddies traveled around the country figuring out BBQ.  They decided not on one style, but a variety of styles from the likes of Texas, Tennessee, and the Carolinas.  Kinda cool, I thought. The other great thing about the menu is that there are plenty of different combo options for maximum sampling.  We ended up with 3 meats and 3 sides between 2 of us. The St. Louis Ribs were definitely delicious.  The held together when you needed them to but were super tender to bite into.  Good and smoky with plenty of sauce for dipping. Here you see our half and half sandwich.  It's pulled pork in the foreground and sliced brisket behind.  Both delish but for me, hands down, the brisket wins the grand prize.  I'd go so far as to say that next time, I'd skip the others and eat A LOT of brisket. We were less enthused over all with the sides, especially the beans.  Kind of disappointing after watching the video and getting excited to try them.  They were just way too sweet for me.  The slaw, too, was a little less than exciting. The mac 'n' cheese, however, merits its own picture.  This was dangerously delicious.  All I had to say about it was, ""Oh my God.  This is what mac 'n' cheese is supposed to taste like?""  I've never been a mac 'n' cheese person but maybe because I've never had a good one.  Until now.  It was creamy and cheesy and moist.  Not at all dry and sticky with pasta so overcooked it's impossible to stab, like most versions I've tasted in the past.  This one was worth the calories! I have to say that I'm a little sad that we didn't try the peach cobbler.  Oh, well.  Next time. The place is obviously a quick-serve restaurant.  Very casual as you can see by the styrofome containers and plastic ramekins.  You order at the counter and hope that there's a seat available for the 'host' to direct you to.  They'll call your number in a few minutes for you to go up an retrieve your food on a cafeteria tray. I think we must've walked in at just the right moment because as soon as we sat down, the line had stretched all the way out the door.  The good news is that these guys crank it out so even if you do have to wait, it's not for long.  But that also applies to you so just know that this is not a place to linger.  It's just understood that you are expected to get up the immediately after you've finished.  Understandable, though. The Short Version (Out of 10)... Food:  7.5 Service:  9 (friendly and fast) Ambiance:  6  (it's not about the ambiance) Overall impression:  8 Would I go back? I don't often eat BBQ and it's pretty far out of my way so you probably won't see me here much.  But that's not because it wasn't good for what it is.  What I'm saying is, just because I'm not going to be there doesn't mean you shouldn't be!",0.9984,0.805,0.167,0.028,0.532958209325397

Sideswise go with the baked mac n cheese, baked bbq beans and fries.  I would personally skip the coleslaw and cornbread but definitely get the peach cobbler for dessert! So when you first get there, get in line to order (you'll see the line when you get there....and there's ALWAYS a line) and afterwards someone will assign you a table.  Don't try and grab a table before you order or you will mess up their whole seating system....I don't know how they manage to do it but it works every time :)  The longest we've had to wait was about half an hour and that was when the line went back to the door so not too bad. if you're looking for good bbq in Chicago, RUN don't walk here ASAP!! :)",0.8614,0.851,0.083,0.065,0.5104166666666667

2011-06-15,4.0,"My biggest complaint about Smoque is that it's closed on Monday, but they are still cooking and the smell is fabulous if you are walking through the neighborhood. My mouth is watering right now just thinking about it.  Other than that, I have nothing but positive things to say about this small storefront in the Old Irving Park neighborhood.  My family goes to Smoque on an average of once/week: on the way to school, on the way home from school and at various times in between. My 8-year-old would probably rank this as his #1 restaurant in the neighborhood -- we go for a bag of piping hot, fresh-cut fries to share on the way home from school on Friday afternoons. My 4-year-old prefers Hot Woks, Cool Sushi, but he's unlikely to turn down a side of Smoque mac & cheese -- served with a nice crust of breadcrumbs on the top. My 6-year-old, a latent picky eater, turns up her nose at the kids' mac & cheese (served without the breadcrumbs and therefore a bit runnier)...and then promptly finishes the bowl.  The portions at Smoque are generous, almost to a fault. I usually order from the children's menu, opting for a mini brisket sandwich (both chopped and sliced are great) & fries and a side of crunchy cole slaw. I'm sated, but not overfull and it makes a weekday lunch at Smoque more affordable. If a giant portion of meat is not your thing, the salad -- with or without smoked chicken (unavailable otherwise) -- is pretty tasty. I've tried about 85% of their menu and it's all great. My husband likes the ribs and baked beans and my oldest child digs the pulled pork sandwiches. I do not like the mayonnaise-y cole slaw served in most restaurants, but I love Smoque's vinegar-and-honey version.  Communal seating may bother some -- especially if you happen to be in on a Tuesday afternoon with a crowd of Chicago's finest in uniform -- although it minimizes wasted space in a popular restaurant where there is pretty much always a line. However, I've had some lucky accidents in seating arrangements and am seated next to or see someone I know three times out of five.  Smoque also provides catering for private parties.

The place was jammed, shoulder to shoulder to the extent that you couldn't move. Want to get to the drink dispenses - forget it, hopeless. We were at the point of abandoning our $40 and just leaving when we finally got to sit down. When we said something to the staff they said ""this is normal"". Well, as I said we've been there dozens of times and it was NOT normal. At one point I counted close to 200 people in there, when the sign says occupancy by more that 45 is illegal and dangerous. Yes, it was. As far as we could tell the kitchen was in meltdown, and there were long pauses where no food was served up whatsoever. Then it became so out of order it was a a joke - at one point they were calling numbers in the 40's and the 90s at the same time. It finally became apparent that the problem was they'd run out of ribs ready to serve, when suddenly trays started flying off the counter. Only problem? The ribs we finally got were so dry and overcooked they could better have been served with a pickaxe. If they'd served them when they were done rather than overdone all would likely have been fine.

Smoque (smōk) BBQ is a neighborhood kind of place that cooks up BBQ good enough to make it a true destination. It was created by five regular guys who happen to be passionate about food in general and BBQ in particular. We believe barbecue is at its best when all of its powerful flavors combine and harmonize. The natural flavors of the meat. The savory flavor of hardwood smoke. The spiciness of the rub. The sweetness or pungency of the sauce. When these elements are in balance, you have found BBQ heaven. We've worked hard to match the right cut of meat with the right rub, wood smoke, sauce, and cooking technique. Our proprietary sauces and rubs are lovingly crafted from scratch in our own kitchen. Same goes for our sides. It's a bit more work to do it this way, but we believe the results are well worth it. We invite you to stop by soon and see if you agree. They have everything from pulled pork, brisket and chicken to coleslaw, baked beans, and the best mac 'n cheese I've ever had (except for Alisha's of course).  This place not only has amazing BBQ but the owners are extremely hospitable. When I went with about 12 teenagers one of them sat down with us and actually threw our trash away for us.

It was fairly priced, but the size of the joint and the location are not very accommodating. They ought to consider expanding, if they remain that busy.

PRO: -THIS BBQ IS THE S***!  Both St. Louis and babyback ribs are VERY smokey in flavor and falls right of the !#@$@$#@ bone.  Simple AND delicious.  The bbq sauce is sweet/tangy, as it should. -Pulled pork is very good, as is brisket.  The brisket literally falls to pieces because it's been cooked so well.   -Mac n cheese is sooooo cheesy and crumbly; speaking of crumbly, peach cobbler is awesome too. -Corn bread is pretty decent; I've yet to eat a cornbread that blows my mind. -The staff is UBER friendly and helpful; there's free umbrellas outside for those who wait when it rains, while all the workers are attentive to your needs and passes out menu to those who wait. -The owner takes care of people, asking what they need, taking suggestions and overall being a top notch restauraenteur.   Conclusion: -If you want to step away from ""corporate"" ribs and get into small joint goodness of bbq heaven, this is the joint!  Worth every wait!!!",0.9917,0.815,0.185,0.0,0.5321532091097309

I live all but one block away from the lake so going out west as far as Pulaski is a rarity, but hell for Smoque I am more than willing to make the trek out that way more often.  When it comes to BBQ I have my own personal particular preferences for various elements to what I consider to be ""Perfect"" I'm talking about factors such as: - Spice/Seasoning: Give great flavor without ruining the integrity of the product - Texture: Tender doesn't always equate to mushy meat. Have it be soft but retain some level of bite that ensures you that you are indeed eating real meat.  - Sauce: Sweet and tangy with a little heat. Balance, viscosity, color - all are important.  - Sides: Costars to the meat that need to be able to standalone.  At Smoque... - the meats taste great. not overtly smoked but just the right amount that makes you remember that smokiness exists for good reason. - the texture is superb. nice and succulent expertly prepared meats IMO. - The sauces I got were so tasty (different sauces for different meats) not too sticky nor runny. I got nice sweet caramely notes along with nice peaks of acidity that brought things together to meet the heat. - the sides here are great! I absolutely love the slaw here. Not mayo based which goes against my normal mantra of picnic style salads (mayo ally) but I really appreciated the vinaigrette.

The hubby ordered the sliced brisket platter with mac n cheese and cornbread. I got the pulled pork with bbq beans and mac n cheese. Both  orders also came with coleslaw.  My pulled pork was so good! Moist pork with crispy edges and skin, with a side of bbq dipping sauce (sweet and tangy). The hubby's sliced brisket was delicious and clearly a favorite as most tables had at least one order of it.  The mac n cheese were served in little foil cups and had a breadcrumb topping that added some contrasting texture to the creamy, cheesy mac underneath. The cornbread was good, nothing spectacular. The bbq beans though - those were spectacular. Served hot, with chunks of beef, a good amount of spice and tang. I loved it.  The slaw was simple, vinegary, and nicely cut through the rich, sweet, spicy bbq sauce and beans.  Pulled pork -- Beans -- Bite of Mac n Cheese -- slaw -- sip of Sweet Tea -- Repeat.

The location is really unfortunate as far as public transportation goes, which is probably the reason we haven't been back yet. Driving will be worth it. We all enjoyed our meals. For myself, I ordered the St. Louis 1/2 slab, brisket, the Texas sausage, mac 'n cheese, BBQ beans. The brisket was by far my favorite. The slab was great, plenty of meat. It's important to note that my BBQ preference leans more toward the fall-off-the-bone saucey type vs. the dry rub though, and that's what the St. Louis slab was, the dry rub kind. But, I enjoyed it regardless. The sauce pretty much made this food trip for me, I loved it. I'm one who tends to think a lot of things need more acid though, so I enjoyed the sauce being more on the vinegary side, but that might not be your thing. There is another sauce available that's much thicker, less acid, with sweeter notes. As for the sausage, it was okay. I would just move on over to Uncle John's instead if you plan on centering your order around something that. I'm not head over heels in love with the mac 'n cheese like everyone else on here seems to be because I've had much better, but it IS very creamy, and very good.

(If you are drooling on your computer right now....I totally understand) The meal was flat out authentic BBQ. Each bite had a mixture of perfectly cooked oink oink, smoke flavor, and tangy BBQ sauce. I also tried the beef brisket and grilled chicken breast and they were equally as good, but I still think the pulled pork was tops.  Drink a lil drink, Smoque a lil Smoque.

2011-04-08,2.0,"My review is based on the 3 times I have been to Smoque BBQ, By now you are probably thinking ok she liked it because she went 3 times so why did she give it 2 stars?   First of all I was not impressed at all with their BBQ ribs nor with their brisket. The first time I went I ordered the ribs and I did not like their BBQ sauce, it was too tangy and full of Smoque flavor that to be honest it was overpowering for me. Their meat was hard to come off the bone, i felt like i was fighting it off the bone and was more chewy than tender. I did like the mac and cheese I just wish they would serve bigger sides, you can literally pick it all up at once with a spoon.  T he second time I had it, my family who lives 3 blocks away from there and heard the great reviews on it decided to order it for Christmas dinner.  I thought hey why not lets give it another try. We called to place an order but they weren't going to be open Christmas eve so we ended up buying frozen ribs from them to try to warm them up at home. BIG MISTAKE. the already ""ok"" ribs were now awful tasting , to say the least it was not a happy Christmas.  So the third time I had Smoque BBQ, my boyfriend surprised me by ordering ribs for pick up there on a Saturday night, we barely made it there before they closed their doors to pick up the food and this time the ribs were the worst i had ever had. I don't know if it was because they were about to close already and they just gave us the last ribs they had, but they were hard full of fat and muscle that you are obviously supposed to take off before you cook, I have made ribs before so I know its sucks and its hard work to take off all the fat and muscle (it also depends where you buy them obviously) We were so disappointed, AGAIN! We swore never to return to Smoque BBQ for ribs, they just were not ribs to be consumed by us, but hey apparently many other people do like them.

This is my favorite thing about this place. I am from Kansas City. Roll your eyes if you want; I'll wait. I'm from Kansas City and nothing can unseat from my heart those champions of BBQ (Smokestack, Gates, Oklahoma Joe's). But I'm also a realistic person. I know it's more convenient to drive 20 minutes south instead of 9.5 hours south when I feel like eating BBQ. And my fiancé loves this place so I'm sort of stuck with it. Now, if this was KC, I'd rate this place on meat, beans and sauce. But this is not KC. And by that, of course, I mean the beans aren't great. So instead I'll rate this place on the tins, the meat, and (dammit) the sauce. The brisket is pretty good. By Chicago standards, I think it's pretty famously good. The sliced brisket has a strip of fat through it which weirds me out, but I'm easily weirded out by fat. I will carve a brand new cut of meat out of a steak if it's served with any normal amount of fat on the edges... and I certainly carve the fat out of this brisket. But this probably only reflects poorly on me, and not on Smoque or most other restaurants, for that matter. The sauce is really where I wish this place exceeded itself. The thin and vinegary sauce is ok, but it's not great or grand. I had high hopes for the thicker sauce but it tastes like BBQ ketchup. And so I suffer, destroyed by my unfulfilled BBQ-cravings. It's good on french fries, though. I'll give 'em that.  But it's in Chicago, you know. It's in Chicago and it's alright. Plus the service is friendly and I'm into that.

2011-03-13,5.0,"I'm passionate about meat, and I appreciate places that have that same passion. This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago, and for my money it's the best barbeque in Chicago. First thing you notice when you go in is the smell. I almost already know if a place is going to be good by the smell. The place is permeated with the sweet aroma of barbeque. Must Have Brisket. Sliced. Not chopped, b/c sliced is the fattier cut. St. Louis-style ribs. Dry rub, meatier than the baby-backs, $1 cheaper. BBQ Beans. Smoked, with bits of brisket and onion in them. The best beans I've had...pretty much anywhere. Pulled Pork. The first time I went I was disappointed, but I must have been expecting something other worldly because on repeat visits, I've come to appreciate the tender delicateness of the pork. Make sure you get the vinegar-based bbq sauce for the brisket and the ketchup-base bbq sauce for the ribs. They should give it to you without asking, but last time I was there they forgot one. Solid French Fries. Fresh-cut, crisp, well-seasoned fries. They give you so much, though, that it can detract from the meat. Recommend share one with someone else. Cole-slaw. Vinegar based. Cleanses the palate decently, and is so straightforward, doesn't try to pretend to be something fancy. Mac'n Cheese. Great taste, though it's a really small portion. (I'm clearly not refined in my mac'n cheese taste buds) Whatever Smoked sausage. Genuinely disappointed. They taste like they could've come from the grocery store. Haven't tried Baby-Back ribs. Seriously, why would I get baby backs when I can get one-of-a-kind (in Chicago of course) beautiful dry rubs? Brisket Chilli. Peach cobbler. Looks like a small portion, but I've heard good things about it. Anything else not listed Recommended meal(s) Listed in order of hunger and descending price (I think) Brisket Platter with a taste of St. Louis ribs. Sides: BBQ Beans and fries (to be shared with someone else). Brisket Sandwich with a taste of St. Louis ribs. Side: BBQ Beans For an emphasis on the ribs, switch the St. Louis ribs and the brisket (you get a half slab of ribs with a taste of brisket, etc).

I placed an order for a 6:30 pickup on Friday night so I wouldn't have to wait in the line from hell. I arrived at exactly 6:30 and my food was ready. So far, so good.  Unfortunately Smoque only has one register and I had to wait for a good five minutes for my order to be rung up...meanwhile my food is getting cold. I also had a $10 A La Card to be deducted from the final total of my order. I didn't know that giving them the $10 A La Card would cause all kinds of problems. Apparently a manager had to come over to handle the transaction which took additional time and then caused everyone behind me to wait since they only have the one register. My debit card was charged; I thought the amount still seemed high after the discount was applied but after being there so long, I just wanted to get the hell outta dodge.  I got in my car and then looked at my receipt and it turns out I was given a discount of 10%, not $10, so I was shorted over $6. I debated dealing with it later but then figured it would be more of a hassle, so I did a questionably legal U-turn on Pulaski, re-parked, and went back in, fighting my way through the crowd.  The girl that handled my food order (not the cashier) saw me and asked if something was missing from my order so I told her no and clarified that I was overcharged. She told me the cashier could help me when she was done with the current transaction she was ringing. So again I had to wait. The girl (pretty much the only bright spot) asked me if I wanted some chili while I was waiting ""because it seems like this has been one huge pain in the neck for you."" I acknowledged my annoyance but declined the chili, but I thought it was a nice gesture on her part.  Again, the manager had to come back to deal with my transaction, which took another five minutes. Why they couldn't have just handed me $6 and change in cash and deal with sorting out THEIR error later instead of making me wait, I have no idea.  They re-ran my credit card for the reduced amount but of course since it was on my debit card, the pending charge is still the higher amount until the final processing. I received no apology or acknowledgment of the hassle (other than the girl who gave me my food) from the cashier or the manager so I found that to be off-putting. I can't think I'm the first person to use an A La Card so they should know how to handle these transactions by now and they should also think about getting a second register to speed up the process for their customers.

2011-01-31,5.0,"In the course of one afternoon I went from a girl who didn't really like barbecue to a girl who was completely ignoring her lunching companion because she was having a special moment with a brisket sandwich. Yes, folks. Smoque is THAT good.  Smoque serves up heaven on an aluminum tray. The brisket is so tender that it falls apart the moment you even look at it. The brisket sandwich (which I'm told is served on Hawaiian bread) will make you forget your manners, neglect everyone around you, and induce fantasies of shoving piles of brisket sammies into your face hole.  The mac and cheese passed the Wisconsin Girl test - it was creamy and cheesy with crisp, buttery bread crumbs on top - and the coleslaw was phenomenal. The peach cobbler will make you weep tears of joy.  The sauce at Smoque deserves its own paragraph, because barbecue sauce is the reason that I don't (or didn't) really like barbecue. Typically the sauce is too sweet or tastes like ketchup and I just think it's icky. However, the sauce at Smoque was tangy and peppery with a little bit of spicy heat. It was perfect. I wanted to drink it.  I have been told that there is usually a line out the door but we arrived around 2:30/3pm on a Sunday afternoon and, while there was a small line inside, it wasn't a very long wait. Also, I appreciated that they seated us at a table for two instead of the long communal tables, because I wasn't minding my table manners. At all.  Go to Smoque. Don't ask questions, just go.

2011-01-28,2.0,"I'll preface this review witha couple of facts about myself:  I was born in Houston, TX and lived between there and Dallas, TX until I was 16 at which point my family moved to Charlotte, NC where I stayed until age 21.  I went to college in Wilmington, NC (far east NC) and lived there for 11 years.  My younger brother and his family live in Savannah, GA.  My father was on a BBQ team in TX for years before I was born and several years after.  I know BBQ. So, we were in Chicago looking for an apartment and a local friend suggested this place.  He went so far as to say the pulled pork was better than any he'd ever had in NC.  My GF (raised in Raleigh, NC) and I decided to give this place a shot. It looks like a BBQ joint outside and in.  We approached the ordring area and looked over the menu.  There were at least 10 people in the ""kitchen"" - more than I've ever had on a hot line (I'm a chef) in my career.  I ordered a 1/2 rack of baby back ribs, side of sliced beef brisket, BBQ beans, mac & cheese and cornbread.  My GF ordered the pulled pork, cole slaw and mac & cheese. Our order was ready in 5 minutes (there isn't any cooking involved - it's all done and ready to be served).  Neither the ribs or brisket had been sauced before the meat left the smoker;  big no-no in the BBQ world.  Sauce should be applied about 30 mins before the meat comes out of the smoker and allowed to caramelize on the meat.  Two sauces came out with our order.  Neither was a Texas-style sweet sauce or a Carolina-style mustard/vinegar sauce.  Neither sauce was appropriate for the meats we ordered. The dry rub on the brisket was good and would have been enhanced by the right sauce.  The rib rub was heavy on chili powder and not complemented by either sauce.  The pork had no rub flavor to speak of. Ribs should be fall-off-the-bone tender if smoked and held properly.  These were not - I had to cut them of the slab.  The brisket was smoked and held properly - very tender and flavorful.  The pulled pork came out just over room temp and had no texture.   Sides...  this was not southern-style cole slaw.  It tasted of vinegar and seasonings with a little oil of some kind.  Cole slaw dressing is mayonnaise, sugar, vinegar and seasonings - which seasonings depends on who's making it.  My GF (initially very excited about eating slaw) took one bite and spit it out.  The mac & cheese was the same stuff I got a Luby's Cafeteria with my grandma as a kid.  I don't what BBQ beans are but we don't have them in Texas or NC.  We have baked beans, which should be a combination of pinto beans, ketchup, brown sugar, bacon and seasonings.  These were swimming in a thin sauce with onions tasted like they had Liquid Smoke in them.  Cornbread was from Jiffy Corn Muffin mix - $1.00 at the local supermarket.  It wasn't bad, I like Jiffy Corn muffins. Overall, the brisket was good- not great.  The pulled pork was awful compared to the BBQ shacks in NC.  The sides were nothing to write home about.  The experience was sub-par at best.  Makes me think I should open a BBQ joint in Chicago.",0.9855,0.892,0.088,0.02,0.45546975546975543

Dipping it into the bbq sauce solved the dryness problem, but masked the natural flavor of the meat. So I ate half without the sauce and half with. I'd say the highlight of the meal was the SIDES. The coleslaw and bbq beans were pretty good (probably b/c they were so sweet?). The mac and cheese was great as well, esp. since the top had that crispy part with breadcrumbs.

We went there on a Friday evening for pick up and, unlike the first time, didn't even have to wait in a line.  We walked up to the counter, grabbed two paper menus (as the chalkboard menu gives my eyes hell) and stepped to the side.  About 3 minutes later, we were approached by one of the employees who asked us if we had any questions and, upon our decline, politely excused himself but made sure to tell us where we could find him if we changed our mind. We finally decided and, again, were able to approach the counter immediately.  The counter help was beyond friendly.  When I asked her how the brisket chili was, she offered me her opinion, mentioned she likes it with Tabasco sauce and offered me a sample.  Sample? Sure!  Except that the sample was an ala carte sized side of the chili which we devoured while we waited for our actual order to be ready. He chose the St. Louis Style Ribs w/ Corn Bread & French Fries.  The ribs were rich in smokey flavor, moist, tender but still edible off the bone (without crumbling).  The corn bread was average and, although I'm not huge on french fries, there is something about the aroma of theirs that makes me sneak a few out of his bag when he's not looking.  I chose the Sliced Brisket w/ Brisket Chili & Mac & Cheese.   YES!  The brisket chili was so good that I actually got a second side all for myself!  The sliced brisket was so tender that I struggled to actually pick it up with my fork.  The accommodating BBQ sauce that comes along with it on the side had the perfect amount of zest without overpowering the flavor of the brisket itself.  The mac & cheese was also delicious. The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is because, for the price, I believe the portions are are a little on the small side.  The meat itself is substantial but the side portions are lacking just a bit.    The side of brisket chili was average sized and so were the fries but, I'd like to see larger corn bread muffins (or offer two for the price you're charging for one) and larger mac & cheese portions, for sure! I should mention they are  BYOB joint, as well!  We plan to dine in on our next experience - the pulled pork is the next thing on my menu!

2010-12-30,5.0,"I'm not a BBQ connoisseur by any means, but this place is delicious, no doubt about it.  It's true that you will generally have to wait for your food (abt 15 min. for us at 2:20PM on a weekday) and you will probably have to wait for a table (but your food will be timed to your seating).  However, Smoque doesn't seem to have either dropped the ball in either its organization or its setup. Smoque is simply too popular and it's dealing with that in the most sensible way possible. So instead of hovering over people as you might do in HK, Smoque has a dude who asks you if you're eating in or out and places you on a list for seating accordingly.  If you think about the space, Smoque isn't actually tiny or cramped. It has tables and seats for at least 40 people. It just seems that way because those seats are always filled.  In any case, if you're whining about the wait ... you're contributing to its popularity so it seems a bit circular. IDK Anyway, I enjoyed everything I ate. My only gripe in terms of the food is portion size (again) I know, but this time of the sides. I know the focus is on the meat, in my case - baby back and st. louis ribs, but I do wish that some of the sides (Mac 'N Cheese, Baked Beans) were a little (a lot) larger. I don't know that if you order them separately instead of as part of a platter if they'll be any larger, but the side orders that come with a platter are definitely not sized to share. The only exception to this is the bag of their steak cut fries, which are delicious.  As for the food itself. St. Louis Ribs were very tender and moist, the baby back ribs less so - but apparently this has to do with sauce distribution. The mac 'n cheese was the tastiest version I've had for a while without any graininess and it definitely tasted of real cheese and not that cheez whiz stuff.  Baked beans were just delicious. Cornbread was a little on the dry side if you were to eat it by itself but paired well with the ribs.  I also love how the coleslaw is not mayo-based (vinegar instead). It provides a really welcome interlude of crunchy sour fiber.  The meal for 3 people came out to about $50 for two platters of ribs that we couldn't finish. Each platter came with about 12 ribs.  Platters come with slaw and your choice of 2 sides. Smoque is also michelin-starred (I assume 1 star but feel too lazy to fact-check), if you're interested in that kind of stuff.",0.994,0.835,0.126,0.039,0.5889355742296919

My other friends have been going on and on about this place saying it was amazing and I just didn't feel it.  2 Stars for logistics and set up of this restaurant: It's so difficult to get a table and you have to wait for a while just to be seated on top of your neighbor. There's one area for drinks that is in the far corner and you're bumping into people just to move. Plus the cups they give you are so small for water, you might as well plan on getting up multiple times just to get enough water. We did move through the line pretty quick considering how packed but still, not a pleasant experience.  3.5 stars for food: Yeah, the BBQ is good, but it's NOT GREAT/AMAZING/EARTH SHATTERING. The portions are decent and the food has some flavor. Sauces are unique and have a kick. The fries are great. The food is priced on the expensive side however. I've had better so I'm sorry to say I can't give it an amazing rating.  BYOB - this is a BYOB place so you can bring your own beer, which is pretty cool.

I went from his recommendation and got the brisket with a side of french fries and macaroni and cheese. The platter comes with coleslaw already.  The brisket was like BUTTER BABY. So, tender..very flavorful  and delicious. I barely had to slice it. The sauce they pour over it was tasty although not as sweet or tangy as I prefer BBQ sauces to be but still very good.  The coleslaw was good, they use a vinaigrette dressing I think. I like that its not a traditional mayo slaw.  The mac and cheese was inspiring. I want to figure out what cheese they used and how they made it so creamy and cheesy.  Fries were crispy and a great compliment to the meat. They give you so much food that I suggest going on an empty stomach or being prepared to take food back home for later.  Dessert: Peach Cobbler!! The topping is crispy and almost like a baked granola that you have to break to get to the fresh tangy peaches and sweet cobbler beneath. It was very good! All three of us at the table was tasting and trying to dissect the ingredients.  & I like the location because its so inconspicuous. I guess thats Chicago for you too though.

Sides are also delish, the last time i got the beans, perfect for eating on your sandwich,  and the mac and cheese. The beans were smokey with little nibbles of brisket mixed in. Mac and cheese was very good, but also very rich, i had to abandon ship mid way through.  oh and they give you coleslaw with everything. hence the four stars and not five. cole slaw really?  go here. do it. your tummy will thank you.",0.8007,0.818,0.12,0.062,0.5371666666666667
2010-11-02,5.0,"Smoque made me change the way I think about BBQ and I thought I knew it all.  It goes down something like this: First, the type of meat is matched with a particular wood that compliments it (just like how certain wines are paired with different proteins).  Then, the smoking technique comes in, which they have down to a science.  Finally, a particular sauce is dressed onto the meat (memphis style for ribs, carolina for pulled pork, etc.). And I thought it was ALL the sauce.  I'm wrong and I happily admit it. So I've been coming since it opened and have NEVER had a bad experience.  Service is quite speedy, despite the long lines, friendly; and the sweet tea (yes, sweet tea), mac n' cheese (just the right amount of sharpness), fries (crispy and not oily) and peach cobbler (sweet/tart) is incredible.  Even the cole slaw has merits all it's own (mostly vinegar with some sweetness and mustard seed for an additional note). I love their BBQ so much it was catered for my 40th birthday party and everyone raved about it. Of all my Chicago BBQ experiences (Fat Willy's, Honey 1, Smokin' Woody's, Smokey Bear's, Gale Street Inn), I would say don't waste your time going anywhere else.",0.9862,0.787,0.184,0.029,0.5357898715041572
2010-11-01,5.0,"For starters, the first time I saw Smoque, it was on the Hungry Hound. Not long after, I saw the Guy Fieri appearance on ""Diners"" and decided to check it out. Now I understand a thing or two about BBQ. I heard about the journey the owner's took that eventually ended up as Smoque. The when I saw that they served beef brisket, my first thought was these guys have a death wish. I can tell you first hand (as many others could as well) is that brisket is VERY difficult to do properly. There isn't much margin for error, especially when working with a Packer's cut brisket (both flat and point cuts together). I've seen so many people and places try to do it and fail terribly (under/over spiced, poor blend of seasonings & overcooked being most common).  They did what most people should do- go to the people and learn how to BBQ properly. The brisket was moist, properly seasons (one spice didn't overpower the other- I wasn't trying to figure it out, I just wanted to eat). If you spend a few extra dollars, you can get a nice slaw and two sides. The mac & cheese was rock solid. I decided to go with fries and they were also very good (note- I don't eat fries much anymore, so someone else finished them off for me). If you say you can make a good brisket but whiff, news will travel FAST!!  So my next visit, I decided to do something else. I bought the smoky Texas sausage (actually, I wanted to just take a bite and take the rest back home). Not too spicy but smooth (it could be spicy for others with much lower tolerance for heat). I had the St Louis ribs my next visit. These ribs are fantastic!! I could say they could stack up with the legends in this area. The ribs were not fall off the bone but nice and tender (I think fall off the bone took a wrong turn from what was originally meant; I believe fall off the bone meant pulling away from the bone NOT literally falling off the bone). For the record, I'm not a pulled pork fan (when I BBQ it, I prefer to slice it; pulled pork not bad but just prefer sliced). Bottom line. The spot is pretty visible and easy to get to. If you find yourself in that neck of the woods, stop by and have a taste. Sit down and eat it or take it home to eat later. You won't be sorry.",0.9084,0.845,0.088,0.067,0.46406565656565646

2010-10-14,3.0,"Overhyped I love BBQ, and I was happy when my friend John decided to treat my wife and I to dinner here 3 weeks ago. I had heard of the restaurant on yelp, and was eager to try their ribs. I never blame a place for being popular, but Smoque is too small (a picture taken in January clearly illustrates this). It can seat about 20 on the left, and about 40 on the right, but the tables and chairs are really close to each other. It's hard to move around when the place is busy (this is an understatement), and you may also find yourself waiting to be seated (there are some chairs by the restrooms, and people were constantly walking by my wife and I). A portly man (I'm going to talk about him some more in a bit) was less impressed than I was. He asked someone, probably the owner, if the restaurant could be expanded. He even suggested that the business next door be bought out (he was politely told that it's hard to buy out a dentist's office).   There are only 2 registers, and the line was almost out the door when we arrived (there were 5 of us, and I'm glad that other customers were respectful of John's daughters- he had 2 at the time, but 3 now). It didn't move very quickly, and it always reached the door or beyond while we were there (we were inside for a good hour). Anyway, it took us about 10 minutes to order. +The menu is small, but diverse enough (ribs, chicken, brisket, pulled pork, Texas sausage). I should have ordered some Texas sausage, but I didn't know that the sausages are really hot links at the time. There's a salad on the menu (a small is $5.45, and you can add chicken for $2.50 more), and John took advantage of the Kids Menu (it consists of 2 meals and Mac & Cheese). There are 6 sides to choose from (ex: BBQ Beans; Fresh Cut Fries), and 1 dessert item (Peach Cobbler). +You can Add a Taste (a meat to your meal or salad) for only $3 or $4 (the latter is for 3 or 4 St. Louis Ribs). +The staff works hard (one of the food preparers was sweating).  When we came in, the cashiers were all business (I expected this), but quick and attentive, and some guys worked diligently to seat people. The food preparers also have a good system going. We ordered over $70 worth of food, but nothing was missing or wrong. +The prices are reasonable (ex: with slaw and 2 sides, a Half Chicken Platter is $11.45). +/-The portions are solid, but not great. Big eaters like me need to spend about $20 here. -There's very limited parking. Thankfully, we were able to park in front of a building that was just about a block away. -The selection of drinks is limited. The soda fridge contains bottled water and about 4 types of soda, and the soda fountain features 6 or 7 selections (if the restaurant is busy, it can be a pain getting to it- it's in the back). St. Louis Ribs (with slaw and 2 sides, a Half Slab is $13.45): 8/10. They're meaty and flavorful (they'll demand that your taste buds take notice), but I actually found them to be too strong in taste (my wife liked them more). Some of our ribs were also a tad burnt. The BBQ sauce we had on the side was pretty good, but light. They're a little more expensive (a Full Slab with slaw and 2 sides is $21.95), but Baby Back Ribs can also be ordered. They're smaller, but possibly better (they've evidently ""been king in Chicago for years""). Pulled Pork Platter ($10.45 with slaw and 2 sides): 8.5/10. The meat is good and not overpowering in taste. I liked it more than them, but I know that the ""kick"" the St. Louis Ribs provide wows most people (this was the case with my wife).  Mac & Cheese: 8/10. Different (because of the crust and crumbs, a container of it resembles a piece of pie), but fairly good. A popular side. Fresh Cut Fries (a large is $2.95): 7.5/10. Not bad, but not spectacular. They're easy to eat and enjoyable enough. Cornbread: 7/10. BBQ Beans: 7/10.  Both sides are just okay.  The portly man came in with his wife. He may have been a food critic (he came across as an uptight snob who wanted to be catered to- he and his wife were also overly dressed). The owner apologized to him (the man and his wife waited awhile to be seated), but to no avail. Anyway, the man was seated at our table, and he didn't like being so close to John's daughters (he may have noticed that they were sick, but I think this really had to do with them being playful- still, they were pretty quiet and didn't make contact with anyone). The final straw came when John was helping a guy bus our area. A napkin fell on the man (it landed by his hands), and he could barely restrain himself (the napkin, by the way, hadn't been used). Anyway, John and I knew that it was ""time to go"" (I'm sorry, but I hope his food gave the man the runs). The layout is poor, but Smoque lives up to its name. The meat is cooked ""Low And Slow,"" and is very smokey. If you have to wait, your food will be worth it for the most part.

2010-10-02,4.0,"Smoque BBQ Survival Guide 1. Parking The restuarant is in the middle of a neighborhood with not much around but houses so street parking seems ample with no meters. The lot directly behind Smoque is for another business during most of the day but becomes available to anyone after 5:30pm for no charge. 2. Times to go I arrived at 6:30pm and there was no line. Good time to go. After 7pm a line was out the door and was still there as I was leaving around 8pm. A not so good time. During the afternoon I'm not sure for I've only eaten dinner here. 3. Seating There are no servers but as you wait in line to order your food a nice employee will walk up to you and ask how many people you are eating with. He will then try to find a place for you and your friends to sit together amongst the bustling little seating area. This is not a great place for groups. The second time I went here I was in a group of 11 and we were split up at two different tables. Not a big deal but it will happen. Whoever you go with though expect to interact with your neighbors. The tables are close to one another and the seating area is usually full. It's kind of fun but it doesn't create a great atmosphere for long coversations or a romantic evening. If you come here you should come here to eat and little else.  4. Food The brisket is very tender. More so than I am used to but it is meaty and delicious and I think my favorite item on the menu. Their baby back ribs took me a second try to really like them. The main issue is that their ribs are blackened more than I've seen before and come dry with a vinager based BBQ sauce on the side. Their ribs are not the sweet, sticky, saucy, ribs I have come to expect when I order baby backs. But give them a second go at another visit or eat your left overs the next day and I bet they will grow on you. I did not try a side I didn't like. The fries were fresh cut and great. The macaroni and cheese was brilliant with a nice creaminess in the middle and a crunchiness on top. The coleslaw was a tasty vinager based one that really helped cut down all the meaty, creamy, and starchy flavors I was eating. For dessert I had the peach cobbler which was great and I don't even like peach cobbler. Food here is good and of the BBQ places I've tried in Chicago: Twin Anchors, Cooper's, Ruby's, this is hands down my favorite. 5. General Tips Be ready to be stared at. Because the menu is posted on a wall right behind you as you sit and eat, the people waiting in line to order have nothing to do but read that menu, stare at your food, and watch you to see if you are leaving so they can get your seat. Don't be afraid to talk to the employees. Yes, they are busy, but I had a worker get me some ketchup, answer my questions about BBQ sauce, and take my garbage. They are there to help and seem happy to do so. If you are coming to this restaurant because of the television show, ""Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives"" don't be afraid to say you are. They fully embrace their tv fame with a huge signed poster of Guy Fieri on the wall and books to buy at the cash register.

I'm a huge fan of pulled pork, so that's the only thing I've ordered both times.  I find the sauce TO DIE FOR.  After living in North Carolina, I've really become a fan of vinegar based bbq sauces, and Smoque's sauce definitely has that ""tang"" to it.  I could bathe in the stuff.  Friends have ordered everything else on the menu and I've tried bites of it.  I like them all, but will always stick with pulled pork. I would have given this place 5 stars, but I'm taking a star away for the horrible excuse that is their coleslaw.  I know that everyone may do their slaw a bit different, but really there is no reason to deviate from the creamy goodness of traditional coleslaw.  These guys do and it's not a good deviation.   Can't wait to go back for more!",0.9901,0.756,0.196,0.048,0.5204545454545454
2010-09-25,5.0,"This is by far, the best BBQ I've had in my life. I ate every single thing we had on the plate! The first thing we had was the Memphis-Style Baby Rack Ribs which were amazing. Succulent in flavor, great crispy burnt texture on the outside, but soft tender meet you can bite off the bone on the inside. Next, the Sliced Brisket was so, so tender and every little bite had a burst of flavor. The outside was nice and burnt, crispy but the rest of the meat was so soft and juicy. I know I'm making all the Texas Rudy's BBQ fans cry by saying this, but I never liked the brisket there and therefore resigned in thinking I just didn't like BBQ. So in a way...Smoque has changed my (bbq) life. I loved the BBQ sauce as well, tangy and meshed well with the meat. Damn. I could swim in that sauce. The sides we ordered were the Mac & Cheese, Peach Cobbler, Coleslaw, and the Corn Bread. Where do I even start? The smalls were a bit too small, it's meant for one person but we ordered a lot of sides to share. I really enjoyed the Coleslaw because it wasn't your traditional Coleslaw - it's not made with mayo at all, instead it is made with a vinaigrette which helps to lighten up and balance the meal and the rest of the more heavier sides. Even the Mac & Chese wasn't that heavy though, just the right amount of cheese, not too much. No complaints about the Corn Bread. And lastly, the Peach Cobbler was the perfect ending to our meal. I don't even know how to describe it other than I've never had Peach Cobbler like that before. Besides the food, this place has no atmosphere. It's in a weird location, located off the beaten path in a small neighborhood. The service is good though. The line is ridiculous but if you go later, it's shorter.

I tried the sauce, but preferred it without any sauce. It's that good. Generally speaking, meat is not a huge part of my diet. But when I do indulge, I always appreciate high quality. This meal was perfection Their smoke flavor and seasoning are incredible. The meat is tender and moist. The Mac and Cheese is wonderful, too. More souffle-like as opposed to creamy. Beans are a bit spicy, but delicious. The Peach Cobbler is to die for. I could have made a meal out of that. What I found kind of cool is that if you look at the menu photography on their website, the food actually looks exactly like that in real life!  Smoque was worth the wait.

2010-09-11,4.0,"So you have to know that today I started my eating with bacon. Just wanted to say that. I have heard of this place a lot, and especially lately the idea of BBQ was just exciting. After spending the day tooling around I was hungry. And I was given this among 4 places. I'm babbling. Took the Blue Line. Walked down the back stairs. From the smell of piss and CTA, you get a whiff of the BBQ from nearly two blocks away. I was excited. We walked the two blocks and took our place in queue like good boys and girl. The line was out the door, but what I quickly realized is most people do take-away. We stood. And waited. Around the corner you see the simple menu. By the time you get to cash register, you should know. We placed our order. Someone asks you if you're staying or going. He'll point you to your table (family style so be warned). We got our 12oz cups at the all-you-can-drink dispenser and patiently waited for our order to come out. At the table, we got a bit of all animals to enjoy: the half-chicken, the brisket and the ribs with a side of sausage. The sides were mac 'n' cheese, fries and beans. We all got the complimentary slaw and a side bucket-sito of the sauce. When our number was called, we marveled at the aluminum trays. And everything was amazing! My wife had the chicken and she actually ate the skin... Which she NEVER does. I had the brisket and it was so tender. And the ribs were not fall-off-the-bone but they were amazingly delicious. The mac 'n' cheese were as everyone says simply divine. No complaints here. The bit is: if you order a human-sized portion you don't walk out of there waddling. It's the right amount of food. The BBQ sauce isn't that thick Kansas City stuff either. It's definitely on the tangy side and a bit sweet. And those beans. MMMMMMFFFF! So good! This place is BYO and folks live it up, most bringing a six-pack of what I believe is beer. That would've rounded this meal off perfectly. Parking's a PITA so be warned.

Now, how to compete with the other 837 reviews... hmmm how about 5 tips for the wise 1) GET THE PLATTER... platters come with 2oz more meat and 2 buns worth less of carbs. do it.  In General portions are big, you sure get your money's worth, I got the chopped brisket platter, comes with over 2 cups of tender chopped brisket, slaw and two sides, which look small, but when its all together its enough to feed a small country.

Addition: Even better the next day, as I am eating this cold at 8am. yummy !! 2) BYOB..... woooo. enough said. 3)  DON'T EXPECT FIRST CLASS SERVICE... though everyone was friendly its very self serve here, order from the counter, no table service, communal table seating, metal trays as plates, and plastic silverware, though they some of the best bus boys in town. 4) DRIVE... if you don't have a car invite a friend who does, don't pass it by, it is not advertised well unless you know where it is, there is lots of free parking just North on Avondale and in front on Pulaski though its not the best neighborhood so leave your brand new Ferrari at home, my friend got the tire cover stolen off her jeep while we were eating... eeek.  5)  GET THERE EARLY... got there at 6:30 on crisp fall night, we were pleasantly surprised that they were practically empty, though by the time we were finishing up a little after 7, the line grew and it was sooo busy ! I had wanted to try the cobbler but it is served warm so the only logical thing to do is order it after your done eating, but by that time I was not willing to wait in that line. Guess I will have to come back !

2010-09-01,2.0,"Where to begin? (To be fair, I love me some Neely's, some Fat Willy's and Memphis BBQ in general; not a huge fan of BBQ from the southeast...unless it is REALLY special). Bad night on the logistical front (computer/register down) so I will not hold that against them. Bus service kept pushing past me to go back and forth (this happens when the line runs thru the center of the room and there is only one set of trash cans...so that was a bit aggravating). I love BBQ...I'm not what you might call an aficionado, but I have eaten a LOT of it in a great many places. I will start with the positive...I have never had better quality in terms of cooking/texture/preparations. 5-star performance on that front. What I will hold against them is their utter inability to BBQ some meat! I had St. Louis and Baby Back ribs; both bland meat. Rub nothing special (too much of something...clove?) on taste but created a nice (carmelized?) crust. Wife had the chicken; exact same opinion.  Mac & cheese could not have set better in the mouth; if only it had tasted as good as it felt.  Slaw vinegar-y, sauce vinegar-y, cornbread an utter diappointment (and I do consider myself a bit of a cornbread expert).  Baked beans...yep, you guessed it...vinegar-y. Onions cooked to a beautiful texture and translucence, but apparently added to the beans because they certainly did nothing to help the flavor; beans were not tender enough. Sauce and everything was beautiful to look at; and I am sure a quite-qualified individual established the recipes/operations. But this is a case of a restauranteur trying to BBQ and not of a BBQ man trying to run a restaurant. I classed it as ""white men can't BBQ,"" no SOUL in this comfort food. The peach cobbler was in a different league altogether, however. My wife is a big cobbler person, and she was ga-ga. I thought the crust, while not your typical cobbler crust, was better than anything I have ever put in my mouth as part of a cobbler, and the peach stuff tasted like fresh peaches (a little tart, not too mushy); cannot ask for much more in this arena (unless it would be to make it cherry cobbler - if they had cherry cobbler to compare to the peach, I would move in...). Overall, a disappointment. I waited for years to get  in there and am pretty well aggravated that I did not instead go to my stand-by, Fat Willy's.

We did skip the peach cobbler which I regretted later. :) The ribs were extremely tender (came right off the bone) and had just the ""right amount of smoke"". The rub was so excellent, you didn't need the sauce. Though we did try it. It's not your usually thick tomato type sauce, but very vinegary (very South Carolina). An awesome dipping sauce for your French fries. I would say the same about the pulled pork.   The brisket was EXCELLENT. After they put on the rub, they put on an extra coating of black pepper. It puts a deep black coating on the brisket. It was by far the best brisket I've ever had (next to mine of course, ha ha ha).     All the sides were fresh and delish and complimented the BBQ just right. I especially liked the mac & cheese, it tasted just like my mom would make and the beans were to ""die for"".

Brisket, not Smokey nor juicy, kind of bland in fact.  Pulled pork also lacked smoke and flavor.   Don't try to add flavor to the meat by dousing it in sauce either!  The vinegar based sauce is the work of amateurs. Ribs were only OK.  Nothing special. The beans had allot of smoke flavor!  The chemical liquid smoke variety.  It was obvious by the texture of the beans that someone was trying to make up for the lack of cook time.",0.8147,0.854,0.104,0.042,0.6512101534828807

At first it was exciting. The smells were good, the place was small but wasn't packed, and the prices seemed fair. Well, the brisket is good but not the 'omg best ever'. Still better than Famous Daves. The brisket chili, however, is amazing. The mac n cheese...doesn't even hold a candle to Kumas or even my own home made. I think the breadcrumb topping tastes like burnt grated parmesan more than anything. The bbq sauce itself is fairly good, but Im not sure I get the hype on that either. My dad thinks its the greatest bbq hes ever experienced and is always bugging me to bring it to WI with me when I visit. I think hes just fallen for the hype of television. Oh, and picking up an order is better than eating there.

2010-08-13,5.0,"We finally made it to Smoque, and it was everything we had heard it would be and more. We picked up and brought home, and everything stayed warm and delicious after the 20 minute drive. We got chicken, which was so moist and smoky, and the ribs, which were really tender, and the pulled pork, which was also moist and full of flavor. For sides we got the cornbread and the mac and cheese, which come in little metal containers that they're baked in, so everything stays really moist. The bread was full of flavor and had pieces of corn in it, and the mac and cheese had a great topping.  Now, the really amazing thing about Smoque is their customer service. When we got home, we realized we had gotten sausage instead of our chicken, and the people on the phone insisted on delivering the chicken to us, AND brought us a gift certificate for our troubles. So above and beyond, and we're definitely customers for life now! Totally worth the trek to support such a great establishment. Thanks, Smoque!",0.9815,0.827,0.158,0.015,0.5874999999999999

It's great to share with other people.  I'll usually split a full slab of ribs and share the small sides.  I really enjoy what this place has to offer, but I feel sometimes there's a hit-or-miss feel.  Once I've went and the meat was a bit dried out.  Sometimes the bbq sauce was too much tang and not enough sweet. Cornbread not quite as hot as it should be.... But still. I do like the place and it's definitely worth the check out.  Just be forewarned. You may have a long wait for dinner hours, so try and head out to this place around lunchtime.  Otherwise an early dinner (like 4-5).

Forget it.  My Dad, his girlfriend, the little sis, and I hoped in my Dad's Jeep one evening and came here for dinner. It was around 6:30pm on a weeknight, and line was out the door. We nearly left and went somewhere else, but my Dad's girlfriend insisted that the food would be worth the wait. Finally we got inside and noticed that a guy was taking orders so that the line would move a little smoother and quicker. He was also nice enough to see to it that we would get a table(all of them were full) and get me a paper menu because my eyes were not allowing me to read the chalkboard menu.  We finally made it up to pay, were kindly seated at a freshly cleaned table, and waited about fifteen minutes or so for our number to be called.  I went with the half and half. Half pulled pork, and half brisket sandwich. For my side I got the Mac and Cheese. It also came with coleslaw. The pulled pork was tasty. Though It was a tad on the bland side, somehow the smoke didn't fully come out in the meat. The sauce helped to add some zing though. It was a tasty sauce, I really liked that it was a vinegar based BBQ because it had a nice tang to it. The brisket half was a whole other story. It was moist tender super smokey. Also had a different sauce. Still tangy but it had a little bite to it as well. The brisket was the clear winner. I ate all my coleslaw, I usually am not a fan of the stuff, but it was not a mayo based slaw. It was crisp tangy, slightly sweet. Yum. The mac and cheese was done very well, it was buttery creamy and cheesy. I just wish that the side had more than three bites in it!  Also I got to sample a rib. Which was super flavorful and smokey, but not tender. To me they were kind of tough. They are dry rubbed with sauce on the side. The sauce with these was a little strange, It actually kinda reminded me of curry, which wasn't what I was expecting to taste. I sampled some BBQ beans as well. The smoke taste in the beans was a little overwhelming, not my thing.

When our food was ready, my first impression was how small the sides were. I tasted the coleslaw first and thought it was a little on the sour side.  At this point you're probably wondering why I gave this place five stars. After one bite of the meat, I knew I was going to give it at least four. After all the remaining bites, I knew why the sides were the size they were. I was pleasantly full. The coleslaw, after a few bites of the rich bbq sauce was a pleasant palate cleaner, preparing you for the next bite of perfectly smoked meat. Next time I go, I'm getting the sliced brisket.

The sauce is tangy, which I usually am a fan of but it detracted from the food. I did enjoy the brisket and sausage.  I did not like the feeling like I was being pushed out by people hovering for a table although it slowed by the end of my meal. This understandable due to the size of the place.

No off-street parking, and on-street parking close to the door is prohibited by signs that say ""No Smoque Parking"".  The side street had little un-signed parking as well. we however, drove around the block, through the alley, went South on Pulaski and parked in the spot closest to the door.  I suspect we were pretty lucky. If you have read many of my reviews, you know that my once-a-week lunch buddy and I go after the lunch rush is over.  When we arrived, the place was full, but as soon as we placed our order, tables were available. Unfamiliar with the place, I appreciated the helpfulness of the host as far as the menu.  They have the menu on a huge blackboard, but he asked me if I would like a pring menu, which I did.  I had already decided I was going to try the sliced brisket, so ordering was effortless. I ordered the fresh-cut fries for my additional side.  I got my cup of ice water and was seated.  I think within about 4 or 5 minutes of sitting down, my order # was called. I really haven't had any really good BBQ brisket this side of Amarillo,TX but I would say that Smoque came close to being like you find all over TX.  The BBQ sauce was more TX-like than you get at most places.  Most places seem to run to a Southern style sauce.  The only thing wrong with the brisket was that it was over-done. I could have eaten it without teeth.  I like my brisket to be a bit chewy.  Not tough, but chewy tender.  The slaw was over-vinegary.  The fries were great! My buddy had the St Louis ribs, with mac & cheese and fries for sides.  He said that the ribs were quite tasty, nice and meaty, and while not cooked so that the meat was falling off the bone, it was close to that.  He didn't care for the BBQ sauce and said he preferred Sweet Baby Ray's. His thoughts about the slaw and fries mirrored mine.   For as fast as the turn over is, I didn't feel we were being rushed to leave as soon as we were finished eating.  So all in all, I'll go 4 stars.

2010-07-26,5.0,"Long overdue review!!! Let me start by saying I don't eat very much meat, but when it comes to Smoque.....my mouth waters and I CRAVE it regularly!! My first of several visits to Smoque was sometime last winter, when it was freezing cold and miserable.  Delicious, creamy, homemade mac n' cheese, tender sliced brisket, and their absolutely AMAZING peach cobbler is just the kind of comfort food I needed to lift my spirits.   Fast forward five or so months to my graduation from college.  We were planning to have a party at my apartment for 20-30 people, and I decided I wanted to have it catered.  Smoque was instantly my first choice.  I called, placed an order with their catering lady and everything was set.  Until..... we arrived 30 minutes before my party began to pick up the food.  I tell someone at the counter that we are there to pick up our order that I had placed with the catering manager, and after running around for a few minutes, he returned only to tell me they had no record of my order!  Immediately, I start going into freak out mode in my head (what am I going to feed all these people!!!), until the owner Barry Sorkin came up to put my mind at ease.  He assured me that he would have the food ready in 15 minutes and that he would personally deliver it to my apartment.  Eventually, they did find my order, but for some reason it didn't make it onto their clipboard.  He told me not to worry about paying, that we could take care of it later.   We get back to my apartment, and 15 minutes later, Barry arrives with my order, and kindly included many extras that I did not order, but that helped to make my event run much more smoothly.  In addition to delivering the order for free, he included a $50 gift certificate to return to Smoque, as an apology for losing my order.  Lastly, they found yet another way to extend their apologies when it came time for me to pay for my order.

And if I'm being critical, the meat was just too bland. Without the sauce their wasn't much ""Smoque."" Really, where's the smokey flavor from properly smoked BBQ? If your joint is called ""Smoque"", shouldn't  the food have that signature BBQ flavor/smell? Being less critical, everything was just down the road, very light flavors and nothing over powering. It's BBQ done OK. Not too dry, but not too moist, but I guess just not enough ""Bang"" or ""Yeow!"" for me. My wife just doesn't care for it and like me can't figure out all the praise. She just can't believe all the hype for just OK BBQ. The line is always long here and be prepared to wait. The counter people have complained that there isn't more space for more cash registers. The place is small and getting a seat is tough. The place is relatively new, clean and nice. Parking is tough around there too, street parking mostly.

Perhaps I'm spoiled by having lived near Texas for a few years, but there should be a little more natural flavor to the sauce. Oh, and my ribs were cold and the brisket was stringy. I can't fault the pink and grey, though! They know what they're doing with slow smoking the meats.  Bottom line: If you're a fan of straight up smoked food, you're overdue here.

Second trip back I ordered only baby back ribs and they were excellent once again. They are not fall off the bone ribs.

I had the sliced brisket platter with cornbread and baked beans, and also shared  the 1/2 & 1/2 rib platter with mac & cheese and fries.  I love brisket, and this wasn't as good as what I like (not as tender and soft), but it was tastiest as I've had in Chicago.  The ribs were good -- the baby backs are smaller than the St. Louis style but meatier, and both had nice flavor.  The baked mac & cheese was awesome!  The fries are a huge portion too, and surprisingly good; they're the thick-cut, skin-on fries.  The cornbread was good (can't really mess it up), and the baked beans had some meat in it, so I liked that touch.  I probably wouldn't get the brisket again, but I would get the ribs again and would try the chicken and sausage sometime.

2010-07-12,3.0,"How do you get to be thought of as being the best around here? 1) Get a good publicist 2) Buy a top of the line rotisserie smoker 3) Differentiate yourself with very limited mix of regional sauces and BBQ.  Hey man, what about the rub man? Well, every credible place by osmosis has some kind of rub. People that BBQ put a lot of love into what they do and I'll say it, pretty much use the same stuff. Going out on a loin, I've never had a dry rub that I didn't like. It really comes down to preference, sweet, hot, salty, mild or some kind of combination.  What is your quest or shall I say, Smoque's quest for a distinct rub? Salt-n-Pepa, that wouldn't be interesting enough to market. They are heavy on the pepper and must be laying down more than a ten spot of ingredients. Beyond the Dr., the additional flavors are subtle and become indistinguishable even for the light FM dippity doer. They could reduce the amount of ingredients by half and the majority wouldn't taste the difference and please, don't give me that intentional blending of flavors between the rub and a sauce. Depending on the thickness of the meat, either the pepper or the smoke dominates over the subtleties in seeking the Holy Grail, I mean Smoque's interpretation of the perfect rub. Btw, was that an African or European swallow?  The Seuss on sauces, I could find at least a dozen either vinegar, molasses or tomato based bottles in the grocery condiment aisle that you'd be going lady gaga over. They offer two, neither has a real kicker that will score a goal unless you're buying off the yelp ref. Interesting, making such a big deal about the Texas style brisket without any traditional sauce. It is closer to being pastrami than having anything to do with Texas. Remind you, this is an extremely subjective area, others will praise the sauces like some fricken fine bottle of wine. They will elaborate on how extraordinary the ordinary is. Oh, I'm sorry, one from each region, how intercontinental insensitive Sam I am. Anyway, I've labeled them thick and thin as opposed to the formally known as Thing 1 and Thing 2. The thicker adds upon the already peppery rub with its own peppy glow while the thinner doesn't stray far, however mildly masked, from tasting just like vinegar. Ironic, the thicker is hiding the vinegar with pepper and then you taste more vinegar than molasses for the thinner.  Will the real vinegar sauce please stand up? Yep, heavy on the vinegar is more of an acquired taste in this region unless for the few of you that grew up on Russell's and some, not all, will be enlightened on how well it compliments select BBQ. Certainly no HFCS in these babies, good thing since your cholesterol is already shooting off the charts and you wouldn't want to add anything else that is negative. So, you really enjoy going back to places where practically everything on the menu is well over 20% in fat, 50% plus in fanny pack calories.  Thumbs up, dirty sticky finger nails and all. Certainly not a fancy highfalutin steak place that has ribs, only possibly pretentious staff and owners behind the counter placing your POS on scrap yard friendly cafeteria trays. Anyway, you can at least sit down wearing your filthy grubs instead of rushing home or gobbling it up in the car. The prices are on par with the take out places, the supposed standard when getting sincere Q. Northsider, well maybe there's one in Evanston that's barely worth avoiding the southern comfort road trip. Don't be suckered into the allure of the take out being more authentic, unless you are more into the soulful Zen of white bread and fries soaking in the sauce routine. Instead of wasting your time and depleting your gas tank, take a load off and taste a couple of Popeye sized sides with your smoked protein. BYOB, maybe you might prefer that 40 oz. bottle without the brown paper bag you've grown accustomed to.  I can't object to anything that they serve. Yet, nothing that I've eaten at this place has ever wowed me. A little something of this or that in the rub or sauce is not going to give me a woody. The meat and the right amount of fat from that meat put into the smoker makes it all happen, everything else is just icing on the cake. I'd tell you straight out if the BBQ is off or bad, not here. Give a lot and I mean a lot of credit to the commercial smoker, the real secret in providing practically effortless and consistent smoked flavor that is not dried out. Imagine the possibilities if every Jewel or Dominick's had a Southern Pride. Alright, the ribs are a tad on the skinny side and I can live without their sauce. As for the pulled stuff, it demands whatever sauce that is laying around to add flavor, contrast and moisture. Brisket, bring on the heat. A hodgepodge crossbreed of this and that for such a small menu, don't get me started.  W-H-A-T, a mishpocha proprietor dishing out some top notch goyish BBQ.

2010-07-12,5.0,"I'm a business traveler, so over the years I've been able to eat at many of the famous (and not so famous) BBQ establishments in the US.  Here is what I know:  Just because its famous, doesn't mean its good (duh); and a ""hole in the wall"" BBQ does not always insure you will have BBQ heaven on your plate.  Something else: most places have a specialty - the ribs, pulled pork, brisket or perhaps even a side; beans, corn bread, etc., while the balance of the menu is only so-so.  Regional tastes dictate different preparation methods, but come down to sweet, sour, hot, mild, salty, peppery an/or various combinations thereof.   Smoque, in my opinion, is one of the best BBQ establishments in the nation.  The balance they achieve between the rub and smoker is hard to beat.  The meat stands alone; sauce is very good (there are two kinds, one peppery, the other vinegary), but not required (and they are stingy with the sauce, too).  Although I order their chopped brisket a little less than half the times I have been there, the ribs are excellent (baby back - I'm a Chicago guy), and the pulled pork is a great sandwich or platter, too.  I have not had the chicken.  The sausage is very good, with some subtle heat to it. The sides are uniformly excellent, although the slaw is not to my taste.  The fries are double fried ala Al's Beef, and very good.  In my close to 20 visits since Smoque has been open, food consistency has been to the same, high standard. Be prepared to stand in line, and sometimes they are sold out of an item (mostly, brisket).  Seating can best be called communal, but that's not a bad thing at a BBQ joint.  Outside seating would be great in the summer, but I'll not hold my breath on that.  Street parking is as good as it gets, but I have always been lucky to find a spot.",0.9902,0.798,0.143,0.058,0.551225845410628

2010-06-30,5.0,"I've enjoyed barbecue all over the country.  Smoque is among the best that I have ever tasted.  Out of all their meat options, the ribs are the most notable. Both the St. Louis, which are larger and meatier, or the baby back, which are leaner and smaller, are fantastic, and hold up well with the best from Texas or Alabama. The rub is great, the smoke flavor is excellent, and the meat is obviously of very high quality. The brisket, either chopped or sliced, and the pulled pork, are both excellent as well. The meat is lean, which may be why some reviewers find it dry. It's also why I choose the ribs over the brisket and pulled pork every time. The Texas sausage and the chicken, which I've only had in the salad, are also very, very good. The sauces are excellent. Unlike traditional Chicago barbecue, the meat is the main player here, and the sauces do not dominate the flavor. That said, both the rib sauce and the pulled pork sauce are excellent. The cole slaw is vinegary and complements the meat quite well. It is one of my favorite parts of the meal. As for the other sides, my favorites are the brisket chili (which they don't always have), the baked beans, and the fries. The mac and cheese is also good. The place is a bit cramped, and their system for organizing who sits when is effective and charming. However, I have not sat down to eat at Smoque for some time, preferring instead to phone in my order and skip the occasionally long line.

I had the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich platter.  1/2 pulled pork and 1/2 chopped brisket with beans and slaw.  The meat was dry.  Both of them.  Either they were cooked to death or they sat in a warming tray for a long time and we got the end of lunch service.  The beans were really tasty.  The slaw was good, vinegar style, I like it.  My friend had the 1/2 and 1/2 ribs.  1/2 St. Louis and 1/2 Baby Back.  They were okay.  I liked that they weren't cooked to death and falling off the bone, they still had some structure to them.  They were tasty, but I've had way better.  He had beans, slaw and mac & cheese.  The mac and cheese was ok, but not my fave.   Overall, the service was really great, the people were nice and it's a typical BBQ atmosphere.  I love BBQ, but being raised in the south, I think I have a pretty high standard.  Think I'll pass on visiting Smoque again.",0.9595,0.755,0.156,0.089,0.482415458937198

We have been talking about going here for months and the built up anticipation was definitely worth it! The ribs were meaty and practically fell of the bone.

While the seating arrangement was a little too cozy for my taste, they are very nice and have an efficient process of getting you seated when eating in.

The coleslaw is obviously homemade and very tasty, so I slapped some on the sandwich. As far as the meat itself, these guys know their stuff. As far as the sauce, it 's vinegar based and thin, not really my style. Don't get me wrong it was good, but it didn't exactly have my taste buds dancing. Ever since tasting Sandy's sauce at Hog Wild, nothing compares. The fresh cut fries are good, salty, and plentiful. My main beef with this place is that if you want to have anything rib -like, it'll hit you up for close to $20. Considering the fact this seems to have become a staple of Chicago BBQ, in my opinion the menu should be a little more extensive.

My fiance hit this dive up yesterday around 7ish pm & there was a small line one the door, but it moved pretty quickly. The place is pretty snug & is like a cafeteria style with the arrangement. It really looks like a dive.The smell was driving me insane, it smelled amazing. I scanned the menu quickly & decided upon a chopped brisket sandiwch & a half slab of st. louis ribs, my fiance (who didn't know the sandwich was going to be an acutal whole sandwich) did the half and half w/sliced brisket sandwich & pulled pork. We ordered for the sides, 2 drinks, a large macaroni and cheese, a large fry, and a large cole slaw. Total price: $46 dollars. We got seated by one the guys. It was packed inside.  We didn't wait too long for the food which was a good thing. I quickly poured the sauce over the brisket sandwich and took a bite. The brisket itself was alright, I didn't get too much flavor from it, which I was surpised because I thought the guy put like a million spices on it. I did not like the sauce at all. I know this is because I am more partial to sweet sauces more than vinegar based ones. The fries were out of this world I loved them, I think my fiance only had a handful and I had the paperbag (which by the way is a great idea because the bag soaks up the grease). The macaroni and cheese was cheesy and I love the crust on top, it just needed a little bit more salt though. The cole slaw was deliciously tangy and refreshing. The ribs were amazingly juicy, tender, full of flavor, and literally fell off the bone. Pulled pork was alright, wish it had a better kick to it and the Texas sausauge tasted like a polish sausage! The drive for us and the price was not worth it for us unfortunately. in addition, the bus boys made me feel very rushed, they kept eyeing us and asking about taking our trays, it pissed me off & made me uncomfortable, it's not my damn fault the place is small & there's a big line, WTF you want me to do!!!

2010-06-13,5.0,Wow!! Sliced beef brisket is to die for and the BBQ chicken is also outstanding. I highly reccomend the baked beans and cornbread for your side choices. Also if u have Any room for desert the peach cobler is a must. But again the the beef brisket and chicken are great and the cool thing is if your torn between the two you can order the chicken and add a (taste) of brisket which is a nice size portion or any other menu item on the side for a decent price. I've been there three times and never been dissapointed so I'd say there very consistent and if I didn't live almost 20 miles away I'd probably be there every weeken.

Since I read Nick C's recent review before my most recent visit to Smoque (as the fiance was dying to go back), I understood that they offer 2 different sauces and maybe that's where I went wrong. Al (the host who was seating us) gave us his recommendations for which sauces to put on what.   All I can say is that the ribs were delicious on it's own but with the ""regular"" bbq, it's to-die-for!  The brisket was awesome again and they were nice enough to give me the vinegar based sauce and the tomato based sauce on the side so I could do what I like.  Both sauces are great but it's a matter of preference for how you want to top your meat.   We also tried the peach cobbler - YUMMERS!  The crust was caramelized and had almond slices to give it an extra crunch!  I'm still drooling!",0.9804,0.818,0.153,0.029,0.5921328671328672

2010-06-01,4.0,went back to the hometown for the weekend and hit up smoque for lunch. we had the sliced brisket platter with mac & cheese and beans and pulled pork sandwich. now at first i was like WTF the portions got friggin tiny. few slices of brisket yet i remember the sides were on the smaller size. brisket was still delicious..meat falls apart and they got good bbq sauce. gobbled the platter up quickly but due to dipping in excessive amounts of sauce it made me content but not full. mac & cheese is crusty on top and gooey cheese delicious. baked beans here are prolly one of the best. they put bits of brisket or ribs so it's quite nice. can't wait until i go back home for some more!,0.9629,0.829,0.152,0.019,0.5151960784313725

2010-05-06,2.0,"Little story. I went to Nashville for work and flew to Nashville Airport. On the way back home, I almost got a ticket cuz I was almost late, but somehow, once I got checked in 'n' all, I had plenty of time! So, since I didn't eat lunch, I stopped by this random bar that served food (remember, this is in an AIRPORT). I had their pulled pork, and while their BBQ sauce was about on par with Smoque, the pulled pork itself was DELICIOUS! But this is not a review about Airport Bar Food, this is Smoque. Then I thought to myself, there is no way that an AIRPORT, no matter where it is, can have better BBQ than an established and popular restaurant like Smoque. I've been dying to go back to compare, and finally I did... Tried: (My rating in parentheses) - St. Louis Ribs (8/10) - Pulled Pork (2/10) (Sides) - Mac & Cheese (7/10) - Smoque Chili (3/10) - Slaw (1/10) (Sauce) - Memphis Style (5/10) This time I got a 1/2 slab of St. Louis and the pulled pork. They had a special thing for Smoque Chili, so I subbed that for the beans. Now that I actually have something to compare the pulled pork to, I can safely say that Smoque's pulled pork is bad. It's try and tasteless. It's so bad that the mediocre BBQ sauce actually helps it a lot, but the texture doesn't change and it's just disappointing. Feels like sawdust, your mouth gets dryer eating it. With every bite I compared it to Nashville Airport's and it paled in every regard. Funny, because this is what people say to try when you go. St. Louis Ribs took a small 1 pt dive. Maybe it's because it's not new anymore, I don't know. 8 is still very respectable; problem is, I don't think I'll ever crave Smoque for it. The rib meat itself is great, but I don't want to have JUST ribs, I want sauce, and if the rib meat is good, but sauce sucks, then it just crapsizes the whole experience. All in all, I'm lowering my Smoque rating to 2/5. It really is ""Meh"" and I really have experienced better. It's not A-OK, and I'm pretty certain that I'll never have a craving for it. In fact, if I'm with a group of people and they all suggest Smoque, I won't adamantly refuse, but I will definitely be the first to offer a new suggestion.

They have a clean up crew that will take your tray and trash when you have finished and will wipe the table down.  It would be nice to have wet naps  so you could clean your hands at the table.  When it's crowded it's a struggle to get to the restrooms to hose off.  Prices were OK but they don't offer a half and half platter so you can sample two different meats.  Instead you need to order one (like pulled pork) then do the ""add a side"" for $3.00.  If you love smoked meats, you need to try their chicken.",0.9936,0.803,0.146,0.05,0.5629810495626821

2010-04-10,5.0,"Soooo, a group of friends decided to celebrate a birthday here on a Saturday night.  Not the best idea since that is when this place is most busy!  We arrived to find a line outside of Smoque and half way down the block!  Good sign since that means it's loved; bad sign since we have to wait in that line. Thankfully the guest of honor (Hi, Nickolas!) was 45 minutes late so by the time we got to the front, they arrived.  If you are carrying out, no worries: you place your order and leave.  If you dine in, however, it's a bit complicated.  You basically wait for your seat and when you have a seat they then put in your order and food arrives in about 15 minutes time.  With a group of 10 in a place that seats 50 (max) and has a continual line of people, that is when it gets tricky.  But the workers were great and seated us as quickly as possible. Now to the good stuff: the food!!!  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich which was amazing!  I also tried the brisket which was pretty good (not a big brisket fan).  Friends ordered the ribs and FYI, there is really no difference between the St. Louis and Baby back (from what they could tell).  The sides I tried were: 1) Mac & Cheese - This is not like the mac & cheese I am used to.  It's different.  Too different.  I am not a fan. 2) Baked Beans - Good stuff if you like baked beans. 3) Corn Bread - Yummy for my tummy!  This was my favorite especially since it is done correctly.  It's sweet, just like me! :) 4) Peach Cobbler Pie - I thought it was great.  It has oatmeal on top which gives it a yummy crunch.  If that's not your style you won't like this (but I loved it!)

Even when the line is out the door, things move pretty fast. I think we usually wait about 15 minutes to get to the register and another 10 minutes for our food. Mmmm, the food. The menu is short and to the point. My boyfriend and I stick to the ribs, pulled pork, and chicken. All amazing (though the chicken can be dry sometimes). The fresh-cut fries are my personal favorite of any fries ever in the history of fries. The mac and cheese is a close runner up. When I'm in a healthy mood, I go for the salad, but it's not my favorite. (I think they use marinated sun-dried tomatoes on it, and I can't get into the flavor.) The only ways Smoque could improve: 1) Move to my basement ... or add delivery service. 2) Have somebody redo that salad; it's not that hard to make a great salad. 3) Get a bigger space or a patio area (or both).",0.9766,0.859,0.141,0.0,0.6781944444444444

Walking in the line was backed up to the door.  For a place so popular, I was not surprised.  I was, however, surprised at the size of the interior.  I figured for a place so popular they needed more room!  Luckily they have an employee who's seemingly only job is to coordinate seating for customers.   The line moved smoothly, the owner conversing and joking with his patrons.  Our turn to order and we dropped our $20 and were politely guided to where we were to sit.  After about 10 minutes sipping my orange Fanta, our order was up and ready to consume.   My chopped briscuit was piled high and deep on two rich pieces of bread, so I trimmed down the mountain of meat using my fork.  I felt bad when I eventually dipped the morsels in the side of BBQ sauce, because the meat tasted fantastic without it....but I craved more flavor!  The mac and cheese was just a bit too cheesy for me but what the heck, I made quick work of that as well.

I had the chopped brisket sandwich with fries and was lucky enough to try some of my husband's St. Louis ribs and Texas sausage. All were EXCELLENT. We weren't planning on getting the sausage, but I had a couple to use (where you need to spend $25) so we added a Taste portion of that on and it was a nice surprise! From what I hear, they're know for their ribs and brisket, so of course that's what we wanted to try.

I ordered the Pulled Pork Platter and my boyfriend got the brisket platter.  When we placed our order we moved to the side and were seated right away. Seating here is communal so you're literally sitting quite closely to the other patrons who (hopefully) aren't gnawing on the tasty BBQ -- but if they are, you can't really blame them. Within about 5 minutes our number was called and we grabbed our food. I was not prepared for what happened next. Wow. Just wow.  My pulled pork (enough to serve 2) was mouthwatering. It was perfectly cooked and also came with a side of extra BBQ sauce (included with the order). The baked mac and cheese was crunchy on top and melted inside. The cornbread was the best though, quite possibly the best comfort food, better than your mom could make it, trust me. I got the peach cobbler as one of my sides (yes, amazingly I had room for dessert)....the perfect ending to the perfect meal. No complaints whatsoever. OH! My boyfriend's sides included cole slaw - I absolutely despise cole slaw but here they make it almost sour - just cabbage, onion and vinegar, it was great in between bites, really crisp and cleansed the pallet. When we finished eating, someone offered to take our plates and the next couple was seated. They clean tables immediately after every meal before seating whomever is next so it's super clean and efficient.

2010-02-28,3.0,"I'm giving Smoque an extra star just for the delicious smell that permeated our car on the way home. If I could have eaten just that smell alone, I would have been satisfied for the rest of my life.  So, I was a liiittttlllee disappointed when I actually got some of that food into my mouth. Just a little bit disappointed. Not ridiculously so.  I got a 1/2 slab of the St. Louis ribs, which Smoque recommends as their ""most authentic"" smoque experience with sides of mac n cheese, corn bread and slaw (I know. You just gained 5 lbs thinking about that, didn't you?) My husband got the pulled pork with sides of the BBQ beans, corn bread and slaw. My ribs were good. I liked the tangy sauce, but I didn't need a lot of it because the meat was smoked well, so it wasn't dry. The meat was tender and while I find the description of meat as ""falling off the bone"" pretty disgusting, this meat did come off easily without being too fatty. They're really the only reason I am giving Smoque 3 stars instead of 2 (even with the extra star for smell alone).  The pulled pork was just ok. I'm biased because my husband makes a delicious pulled pork and I didn't think Smoque's was any better than his.  The sides were, well, meh.  The mac n cheese didn't have much flavor to it, and I am not a fan of the bread crumb topping at all. Come to think of it, the corn bread didn't have much flavor either. It was pretty dry and I have had better from a box from Trader Joes. Husband said the beans were good, I thought they were just ok. Honestly, the slaw was pretty bad. I thought I would like it more because it's not too saucy, which is good for me considering that in my version of hell, everything is covered in mayo. But it just wasn't good. The cabbage pieces were too large and again didn't have a good flavor. I took two bites and offered the rest to my husband, who will eat pretty much anything, and even he declined. Oh well.  We called ahead and picked it up, so I didn't have to wait in the line out the door when we got there. I just walked right up to the pick up counter, paid my $30 and got out of there. I'm glad I didn't have to wait very long.  So, all in all, Smoque was just as the rating says, ""A-OK"". It's a good option for winter months when you don't want to BBQ yourself, and I prefer Smoque to other BBQ joints I've tried in the city. That being said, Smoque isn't putting Chicago on the map in terms of BBQ, but it will do in a pinch.",0.9968,0.748,0.19,0.062,0.6246507936507938

I have been going there a few times a month for a couple years and have yet to have a bad experience  Reasonable prices.

Many times there is a line out the door, but rest assured it goes quickly  Tips:  it's BYOB - so take advantage of that.

The food here is simply good stuff.  While it's not the best BBQ I've ever had, it's damn tasty and it could hold its own in a smoke-down.   First up, contender #1, the pulled pork.   Standard fare, and as far as I'm concerned, the bar setter at any BBQ place.  Very tender meat and I really liked the extra sauce served up on the side to add a bit more wetness, because some of us like it like that. Second up, contender #2, coleslaw.  One word: vinegar vinegar vinegar!  That counts as one because it was just repeated, right?  Smoque does coleslaw just like I prefer and not creamy at all.  Only fresh, crisp, and vinegary.  Snap!  Did I mention vinegar? Contender #3, the fries.  Big, hearty, and served in a brown paper bag.  That's cool. If you go here hungry, don't order a small side of anything expecting a huge amount.  It's literally a small portion.  Also, don't expect a quiet, private conversation with your bestie or a date.  The tables are communal and just enough elbow room to keep the person at the next table from slopping BBQ sauce your way or swiping a nibble of that brisket.

I haven't smelled ribs, I haven't had ribs in forever, I just wake up with this gut feeling that tells me-hey, you need some damn ribs in your life. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, I need some BBQ in my belly. Maybe it's because I lived in Texas those two years of my life, I don't know. I had been meaning to try Smoque but was terrified of the long lines that I heard about. If there's one thing that I don't like, it's waiting for food when I'm hungry. I get grouchy, I get mean, I get-well, we just don't need to see me when I'm too hungry. So once upon a saturday, me and the bf woke up early to go and get BBQ. We got there around 11:45; no wait in line at all for us! I was excited! But I didn't know what to get. And there wasn't a combo platter, OH NOES. I wanted to try everything. So. I kind of did. I got a half slab of the St. Louis ribs and a side of brisket. My lovely boyfriend was so kind to get the pulled pork sandwich, so I got to try some of his as well. Everything was delicious. I don't know what brisket these other people are eating, but mine was quite tender and not dry at all. The ribs had the nice pull to them that you expect from St. Louis ribs, and I really appreciate the fact that you get different sauces for different meats. A-plus. So that was Saturday. Then Tuesday rolls around, and my boyfriend offers to pick up Smoque again for dinner. BBQ and Lost? Who can say no. This time, I got the pulled pork sandwich and a side of the sausage.We also split another half slab of St. Louis ribs. I loved the bread that it came on, I felt that it didn't soak up all of the bbq sauce and let it marinate on down into the meat. The sausage was wonderfully smokey with a hint of spice in the background. I wish it was a little spicier, but I think that's because I love hot links.  I'm really only giving it four stars because I think their sides could be a little better. I enjoy the mac and cheese, but it doesn't blow me out of the water and there aren't enough vegetable options. Like, hello? I could be eating some greens with my ribs.

Recco'ed by JL who has never disappointed and really knows her eats. Keep your friends close and your foodie friends closer. Nestled on a street lined with small businesses and residential homes, the brick building stood out with the name painted right on it. The minute we walked in, the smell of BBQ wrapped around you like a warm hug. Mmmm...barbequey hugs are the best.  The atmosphere was like being in someone's garage. One wall held a huge chalk board with the menu. I didn't have to look far before deciding on a 1/2 slab of baby back ribs with 2 sides for about $14. I originally chose mac and cheese and coleslaw as my sides, but happily found out that the meal already came with slaw and so I ecstatically selected cornbread. Tears almost came to my eyes as I realized they served Coke. After being at multiple places in the city, I was beginning to think the entire state of Illinois only served Pepsi. But there is was, a self-serve fountain soda machine with Coke clearly written on the side.  Some guy told us to order our food first and he would put together a table for our party of 5. The entire place probably only seated about 25 or 30 people. We were seated by the window, right next to the counter where the food came out. We probably waited about 10 minutes, maybe less before our orders were called. You help yourself to plastic utensils and there are plenty of napkin dispensers on the tables. Important detail: the napkins came out from the top so they were easy to pull with your bbq-laden hands. Very important to have easy access to napkins. Anyway, the ribs were flavorful, juicy and fell off the bone. They give you extra sauce and it was probably the best BBQ sauce I've ever had. I wanted to stick a straw into it and drink it. The cornbread was so warm, the crust was perfect and the bread was moist. It and the mac and cheese, so cheesy, so yummy, both came in these little aluminum containers that were the perfect size. Anymore and it would've been overkill. The slaw was vinegar-based, not mayo-based, so it was interesting and different, but in a great way. For 5 people, it was only about $70. Others at the table got brisket (thumbs up) and someone got the fries, which came in a mini brown bag that soon became grease-soaked. They were regular-sized fries, just simple tossed in like salt and pepper, but still had the skin on. And they were fried to perfection. As we finished one by one, some guy came by and took away some of our trays for us. As we stood up to leave, my colleague who ordered the fries put it on his tray. I panicked.  Me: ""Are you going to throw those away??!""  Him: ""Well, yeah.""  Me: ""Are you crazy? I'll take them to go and eat them in the car."" So he handed me the bag, I took some napkins and wrapped the bottom, and took them with me. As we pulled away, I looked back and was so sad that this would be my only visit to Smoque during this trip to Chicago. As I sat in the back row of the Sienna, with my Coke in the cupholder, I finished off the bag of fries in about 5 minutes and was completely content.

2010-02-10,4.0,"A few weeks ago, my fiance and I made our inaugural trips to both Detroit and Slows Bar-B-Q, returning home with glowing things to say about both.  I posted a review on Yelp talking about our really positive (and delicious) experience at Slows, and almost immediately received a note back from another Yelper, telling me that Slows was good, but Smoque was ""10x better"".  So, when I was in Chicago and my friend Keem suggested that we go to Smoque for lunch for delicious, delicious BBQ, I was suitably intrigued.  AND also hungry. We met up with other lady friends at Smoque on a sunny Super Bowl Sunday afternoon, our mouths watering by the time we walked in the door.  A number of people were in and out picking up Super Bowl catering orders while we made our selections - in fact, about half of the restaurant was blocked off for Super Bowl pick-ups - and justifiably so, as this is just the kind of grub I'd want at my Super Bowl party, were I to have one.  We all settled on pulled pork sandwiches, available in the full or half size, with varying sides.  I had a vinegary cole slaw and a very large bag of hand-cut fries that we all shared - in addition, the others tried the cornbread and the macaroni and cheese, both baked in little foil ramekins.  Our sandwiches came with a bit of tangy sauce ladled over the top and a small cup of vinegary sauce to add at our discretion.  For me, the half sandwich, shared sides, and a soda were just the right size for lunch - though I regretted not being able to try the brisket (available chopped or sliced) and the various ribs on the menu. How does it compare to Slows?  In my non-expert opinion, I'd say they're just different animals.  Slows has a more expansive menu, but what Smoque does, it does well.  I liked having more sauce options at Slows, but I also liked the simplicity of the Smoque experience.  I felt like the meat was more flavorful at Slows, but I liked being able to get a half portion AND sides for a lower price at Smoque.  BBQ is something many people take seriously, and I am not one of them, but I am grateful that Slows is nearby, and that I can visit Smoque whenever I'm in Chicago.",0.9978,0.772,0.204,0.025,0.547777222777223

Verdict: Good, but I've had better sausage in my day. - Brisket: Flavor was AMAZING with AND without sauce. However, when they advertise 15 hours of cooking, I expect it to be ridiculously tender..maybe I came on a bad day. Verdict: Delish. I'll definitely give it another go, though. - Baby Back Ribs: No lie, some of the best BBR I've had in a while. Great flavor. Lean meat. SO tender. Verdict: Primo stuff.  - St. Louis Ribs: Apparently I've been sheltered most of my life because I have never heard of St. Louis RIbs. Stuff is AMAZING. The rub on these bad boys is insane. There was so much meat on there, too. Verdict: You gotta try it. - Sides: Mac n Cheese was ok. Slaw was above par. Fries had this divine seasoning. Overall, service was solid.

The Chili was listed as the special side of the day.  The Chili was fabulous. It was made with Beans, Brisket and onions. It had a nice kick to it.  The Brisket was a decent sized sandwich. The Dry Rub they used was tasty. The sauce they use is decent but It could use a bit more heat. I added some Hot sauce to mine to give it a little more of a bite.

Slaw - I normally prefer a creamy version, but this was surprisingly good. Pulled pork sandwich - pork was a little dry and I had to pull off several chunks of fat.  I like the pork completely smothered in BBQ sauce, and the amount of sauce given still left me with non-sauced pork at the end.  The top of the bun was rather dry, which also made me want more sauce. Sauce - Tangy, good flavor, not very thick.   Fries (I ate two of my husband's fries) - Very good, but I don't really go to a BBQ place for the fries.  This place is fine for a causal meal.  Be wary of going in the winter.  It was cold in the restaurant and by the time I was about half-way done eating everything on my tray was cold.",0.9758,0.838,0.14,0.022,0.5040128205128204

It was very lean and flavorful and had a nice crust. The brisket was really good, but just a tad fatty for my taste. Sauce was tangy and a bit on the thin side (not a criticism, just a fact). I happen to love the 'slaw here. It's not the traditional creamy version, but has more of a vinaigrette dressing.

2009-12-23,4.0,"4.5 stars. Prior to eating at Smoque, I simply believed that one could not get great BBQ on the North Side of Chicago. Now there are a whole slew of bbq joints, but Smoque takes the cake. Pulled Pork: perfect mix of crisp, chewy bark and tender meat. Brisket: fuckable. The brisket is fuckable. Mac n' cheese: Crisp top, gooey inside, strong cheese, not overcooked pasta. Awesome. Slaw: God I love that there is a place in Chicago that doesn't ruin its slaw with the world's worst condiment. Also, it's healthy! (not that anything else here is, but you don't go to Smoque to please your Weight Watchers guru). BBQ beans: So. damn. tasty. Bits of brisket in the beans, enough onions and spices to offset the delicious sweetness. Did I mention that there is chopped brisket in the beans? Brisket chili: A special that I've had the last two times here- hopefully it will become a permanent menu fixture. Personally I prefer pinto beans to the large kidney beans that populate this chili, but the brisket is so good you kind of forget that you are eating chili and not just foraging for meat gold. Fries: The reason I give this place a 4.5 and not 5. Okay, they're pretty good fries, but if you're gonna go to the trouble of eating one of the most unhealthy things on the planet, why not season it up a bit? I like that there are places popping like Edzo's Burger Shack that doll up the fries. But maybe it's just that I don't really see the point in plain fries... Sauces: The house BBQ sauce is thin, sweet and vinegary: It's not a North Carolina style sauce, but more similar to that then what you'll find in a bottle of Baby Ray's. -The other sauce (is it called Memphis?) is what I usually go for. This is what uppity food connoisseurs hate, and what most midwesterners love: A sauce that is thick, sweet, and full of deep, peppery flavors. People say that this stuff masks the BBQ, but I would beg to differ: Is it not possible that creating the perfect BBQ sauce to complement your meat is just as high an art as creating a good piece of BBQ-ed meat? All I know is that when I lather my brisket in this stuff, I taste both the meat and the sauce, and it is a match made in heaven. Line: I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes and usually go at prime dinner hours. Dining area: It is what it is- this is a BBQ joint, you pay BBQ prices, picnic tables are okay by me.

2009-12-08,4.0,"Being a bbq fiend and a certified bbq judge, I had to seek out some barbeque during my Chicago trip.  Due to my limited time frame, I was only able to hit up one spot and I decided on Smoque after a good bit of research.  I got up early for the sole purpose of hitting up Smoque even though it was way out of the way (I used 3 modes of transportation to get there - very rare for an Atlantan). I managed to arrive a little bit after they opened and beat the crowds.   Due to a lack of breakfast, an intense desire to sample everything on the menu, and that sense of abandon you sometimes feel on vacation, I ended up with an absolutely obscene smorgasbord of food sitting in front of me (check the pics).  Despite the grueling task facing me, I totally devoured all of it like a boss.   The Meat: -  1/2 rack of baby back ribs - These were pretty good - maybe B+/A-.  They had a nice smokiness and bark to them.  The texture was solid (not extremely tough or ""falling off the bone""), but they could have been a little more tender. Overall, they were tasty, but could've been a little better.  However, they were my favorite of the three meats I sampled.   - pulled pork - The pork was decent - a B-.  It was nicely-pulled, had a nice bit of smoke and was tender.  However, it was probably cooked a little too long as some parts were borderline mushy.  It also seemed to be a little underseasoned too me.  It was also served with the sauce already on - which is a no-no (good meat should be able to stand on its own).    - brisket - This was fairly good - a solid B.  The flavor was pretty good on the brisket, but it had what I've found to be a common problem with brisket - dryness.  The brisket was a bit on the dry side.  It was also served with the sauce already on which in nearly all circumstance I don't like but here it didn't really matter since it helped combat the dryness.     The Other Stuff: - sauce - Not bad, but not really memorable either.  Kinda sweet, kinda vinegary.   - mac & cheese - I love m&c that has a crumbly/crunchy top so I really liked that aspect.  The rest underneath the crust was good as well, but didn't have the smooth gooeyness that I like.  Flavor was pretty good throughout.   - fries - The bag of fries the most impressive thing I ate there.  Who would expect it, right?  But seriously, they were excellent - hot, fresh, crispy on the outside/soft in the middle, well seasoned.  I wish everyone could do fries like this.  Maybe they were just really spot on that day with them though.  Who knows.  Dare I say - maybe the best I've had in '09? - cole slaw - Kudos to them for having a non-mayo-based coleslaw (mayo sucks).  It had a lot of potential to be really good, but it was so sour/tart that I couldn't eat much of it.  Lessen the acidity (lemon juice maybe?) and it'd be solid.   - peach cobbler - I didn't get a picture since I ordered it to-go afterwards and ate it later, but there is a pic of it already up.  Anyway, it was very good though a bit non-traditional for a cobbler (crumble top, somewhat heavily spiced).   - sweet tea - It was ok - better than I would expect for a Midwestern joint. Non-food Impressions - The staff seemed top-notch: competent, friendly, & helpful.  - The restaurant is certainly nice enough for a bbq joint.  I like the large menu on the wall.   - The layout of the restaurant seems problematic though.  The arrangement of the line, the drinks, the food pickup, and the layout of the tables seems poor.  You have to go all over the place and through lots of people if it's crowded.  There's no logic or flow to it.  I didn't have the problem since there was hardly anyone there when I went, but I'd bet it's pretty chaotic when there's actually a bit of a crowd.  However, I realize that they might be doing the best they can with the space they have to work with so, if that's true, you can't fault them too much.    Overall, Smoque was pretty tasty and serves up some good bbq.  I wouldn't be surprised if it's the best bbq that Chicago has to offer.  It's better than quite a few places in the A even.  Anyway, hitting up Smoque was definitely an adventure - and a satisfying one at that.   Smoke meat everyday. 4 [Ed.

First the experience. This is not going to be a leisurely dining experience. More of a ""get in, get food, get out"" mentality. They have to move people through as the space is small, the crowds are large but they have a system that is pretty darn efficient even on a Saturday night.  We ordered a little bit of everything . . .brisket, ribs, Texas sausage and all the sides. I loved that the meat was rubbed and smoked and that the vinegary BBQ sauce is served on the side- to slather on or not- your choice.  The portion sizes for the meat are large but the sides seemed a bit skimpy to me. The foil ramekins that the mac and cheese came in were small but I guess that's so the star is the meat, The peach cobbler for dessert- also good but call me crazy but I'm a girl that likes my food served on dishes. I get the simple approach- I just don't like to eat off of foil, paper lined trays and Styrofoam bowls.

I've only had it in sliced form and I've been told this is the far superior style. It's smoky and saucy but not too saucy (but just saucy enough if you know what I mean). It reheats well, so dont hesitate to get some to go. Maybe a pound of two. Eat it for breakfast. Seriously. Cornbread- EXACTLY how I like it. Not dry, chunks of corn...perfect amount Mac and Cheese- ditto what I said about the corn bread. Delish. Brisket Chili- everything I said about the brisket, but add gas Cole slaw- not mayo-y, so not my style, but people that like a vinegar cole slaw tend to like it. I've also tasted the St Louis ribs and they were heaven as well.   About the place in general, yes, it's packed (thanks Guy Fieri!) but it's BYOB so bring something to drink while you're in line.

We were in town for the USC/Notre Dame game and decided to break our tradition of having pizza on the first night so we could try this legendary restaurant. And it was a little bit of a tough sell because from our hotel in downtown it looked like it was half way to O'Hare. But after the first few bites the consensus was that it was worth the $20 cab ride.  I went with the baby back ribs and they were the best I have ever had. I liked that they were served with the sauce on the side so you could appreciate the rub that not only flavored the meat but caramelized slightly to give the ribs a great texture. The girlfriend, J, is a brisket fan and she declared the brisket at Smoque the best she's ever had.  So why 4-stars and not 5? Well for me the barbecue experience has to have great sides. The sides at Smoque are great. We had a combination of mac & cheese, beans, coleslaw and cornbread.

2009-10-08,1.0,"Northside/Southside...the BBQ Difference Tonight I drove from River North all the way to Pulaski and Irving and home to Edgewater to suit a craving for GOOD ribs.  I've heard amazing, glorious rave reviews about Smoque and had to give it a try. Over the years it's become apparent to me that there are two kinds of BBQ ribs in Chicago - Southside ribs and Northside ribs.  You could also say that there are juicy, perfectly smoked, saucy, meaty, succulent, GOOD ribs (Southside) and ribs that make me weep that a pig was slaughtered for nothing (Northside).  But I keep hanging onto the dream that somewhere on the Northside is some miraculous place that actually knows something about seasoning, smoking and saucing ribs.  So when I hear rave reviews about a BBQ rib restaurant on the Northside, I eventually cross my fingers, dive in and try it out. So tonight I dove into Smoque... ...and into a disappointing, hot mess.  I knew I was in trouble from the beginning when I ordered a half slab and requested the large end.  Not only did the order taker not know what the large end was, but when asked she informed me that customers usually do not specify which end of the slab they want (note taken about the customers).  I was also certain at this point that the fries would not be served nestled beneath the ribs or that 2 pieces of white bread would be found atop my ribs, but that is all forgivable.  I also ordered the pulled pork taste and brisket taste.   Getting home with my bag'o'meat I hoped for the best and prepared for the average.  Below average is what I got.  I don't recall ever seeing such a skinny, scrawny bunch of ribs.  The pig was obviously an anorexic with self image issues.  The chewiness of the meat though was ideal - I don't believe that meat is supposed to 'fall of the bone,' I like something that fights back a bit.  The seasoning was only on the surface, not throughout the meat.  The smoky flavor tho was throughout the meat, and was quite nice.  But then there was the sauce.  It's cute how the sauce was served on the side as if it may ruin the majesty of the rub that was used.  Perhaps the reason is that the sauce was so...bad.  It was definitely better than Open Pit, but not as good as Sweet Baby Ray's, which is available on the shelf at Dominick's.   Still I was certain the brisket would save me.  Wrong!  Since when is brisket dry?  This is actually the worse brisket I've had.  I gave it to my cat but she wouldn't eat it.  However, if you like Smoque's brisket, know that the $3 taste portion is a generous amount.  The fries were excellent!  I haven't tried the pulled pork yet, but fear it may end up in the trash to keep the scrawny ribs company.   Sadly, Smoque was just another place in a long disappointing line that proves that Northside restaurateurs should just put away the sauce, turn off the smoker and travel a few miles to the South side to learn something about the food they are mocking with their below par efforts.  If they don't want to go to the South side, then maybe a weekend trip to Jim and Nicks in Birmingham, Dinosaur in New York, Gates in Kansas or the guy with the BBQ grill in the post office parking lot in Waterloo, Iowa may help out.  These ribs are all different, but they are all good.  Just please, I beg of you...go learn something so I can get good ribs close to home!!! Still there is one meaty reason for Smoque and their ilk to ignore my review and my advice... they have great reviews and tons of customers.  This leads me to acknowledge that there is an entirely different way of preparing BBQ ribs which a whoooooole lot of people love and appreciate...the Northside way.  To everyone who enjoys Smoque and their buddies - enjoy!  Eat it up!  Sop it up!  Love it!  I truly envy you in your bliss.  Whatever you do, do NOT go to the Southside and eat real BBQ, such as at Lem's on 75th, as you will find yourself in my position...forced to drive 18 miles for enjoyable BBQ ribs.  If anyone reading this knows what I'm talking about and knows a Northside place that proves me wrong...PLEASE tell me.",0.9974,0.784,0.15,0.066,0.5218633705475814

2009-09-06,5.0,"Smoque BBQ is without a doubt the best BBQ joint you can possibly find in the Chicago area. Of course, that isn't necessarily saying much. Many Chicagoans have considered a full slab of ribs cooked in an oven and slathered in sweet and sticky BBQ sauce to be actual ""BBQ"". As a result, there are very few restaurants that serve REAL BBQ, which requires several hours of slowly smoking various types of meat (Pork Shoulder, Ribs, and Brisket) at a low temperature. While it can't be said that the food at Smoque can truly compare to the stuff you can find in, say, Kansas City, it's more than good enough to satisfy both connoisseurs and newcomers to BBQ, and you'll find a little bit of everything on the menu. How about a Texas style sliced brisket sandwich with a side of BBQ Beans? Or a slab of St. Louis style ribs with fresh cut french fries and mac and cheese? Everything, whether it was an entree or a side, was consistently fabulous each time I went. Unless you're not into smoky tasting food or meat in general, there's really nothing to complain about. The service was minimal (you wait in line to order and then pick it up when your number is called), but the staff was incredibly friendly.

I'm very picky about my mac & cheese, none of that kraft easy mac stuff for me!  This one came with a great crust and very cheesy on the inside.  The pulled pork was super succulent and very flavorful, even without the bbq sauce.  The brisket was almost too tender, I had the hardest time trying to pick up a piece with my fork.  The Brisket Chili was their special side of the day, that was so-so, I'd probably try the beans next time..or just get 2 mac & cheeses!   My only complaint is the false sense of optimism when you walk through the door and order your food.  If you're waiting for a table...prepare to wait another at least another 15 minutes for a table to eat all the yumminess at!  p.s. their cold pulled pork/brisket leftovers were almost better than the original.

The Chicken and sliced brisket are always a fail safe choice.  In fact, you can't say you've truly had smoque bbq without even trying them.  It is rare to see smoked chicken served so juicy and tender at other bbq joints.  Smoque has it down to the science.  I can honestly say that I enjoyed the chicken more than the ribs, sausage and both briskets. One shouldn't under estimate the sliced brisket though.  The passion for real smoked barbecue shines with the sliced brisket.  It will basically melt in your mouth.  The sausage is pretty good, as are the ribs.  They stay to the chicago roots and offer the baby back, as well as the fattier St. Louis style.  Both are great decisions. The side dishes are simply alright.  A little bit small if you ask me.  They are all served in little tinfoil cups, except for the beans and cole slaw, which are served in the classy styro containers. The beans are made with chunks of chopped brisket and are definitely the best option of the few.  For dessert, Smoque offers a peach cobbler served in the same tinfoil cup.  Not bad, just tossed up there on the menu.

I checked out yelp reviews before we went and am thankful for the heads up on the wait to get in & order food.  We were there on a Sunday and the line was not out the door, so I figured that was a good thing. It was around 7:00 p.m. and it was 15 minutes till we ordered and another 15 minutes to get the food. We decided to take it home instead of eating in.  I am not an expert on BBQ. I've eaten it in and around Chicago at various places. I've eaten BBQ in St. Louis, and KC. I've can't recall any bad BBQ any where I've tried it, there are just variations of it.  We got the pulled pork, which was very good. It was moist and had a mild smoky flavor. I loved the vinegar based sauce, it is not hot or sweet, the right amount of flavor to compliment the pork.  The chicken was good as well, although a little dry. The chicken had a nice smoky flavor to it. The sauce that came with the chicken was thicker and sweeter, it was good.  We got a side of brisket. I've only had BBQ brisket once before at a South Carolina style BBQ place in Maryland. This brisket was UNBELIEVABLE. When ordered we were asked ""sliced or chopped"" we opted for sliced. The flavor of the meat, the smokiness of it and the melt in your mouth tenderness was too much! The side portion of it was generous and I may be a brisket convert.  The cole slaw was vinegar based. It tastes like rice vinegar, celery seed and has thin slices of red onion which adds a pop of flavor. The cole slaw is different -  in a good way -  very refreshing.   I am an expert on baked beans, have had many excellent variations of them home made and out, but these rocked my world. The beans are smoked, have hints of brown sugar, chunks of bacon and onion and taste so good as I write this I want them- now!. I didn't believe how fast I chowed down my side order. I wanted to head back on the kennedy to grab more before they closed. I restrained myself. But from now on large side of baked beans, maybe 2, one to eat later in the week might be a treat.

It was tender, moist and smoked/seasoned perfectly.  They don't put any sauce on the food, instead giving you a generous portion of sauce on the side.  Their sauce is adequate, but not the best.  It is watery and smokey.  I prefer a thicker sauce, like Sweet Baby Ray's.  I took my order to go and ended up using my own sauce at home.   Side dishes were pretty good.  The fresh cut fries, perfectly cooked and seasoned were outstanding.  The mac and cheese is very, very good.  Mac and cheese is a good litmus test for a restaurant and they passed this test with flying colors.  I also tried the peach cobbler and was disappointed.  It was not very sweet or rich. Lastly, it is BYOB.  That means you pay half price for the same bottle of wine at a non-BYOB restaurant.  The prices are reasonable, you save on the liquor and they have great food.",0.9986,0.7,0.27,0.03,0.5043609022556391

The verdicts? My pulled pork sammy was delicious, and hit the spot right where i wanted it.  Dumped the coleslaw and the sauce on the sandwich, and was good to go.  Ate the shit out of it.  I really like the sauce; it's tangy and flavorful.  Typically I'm all about the spicy-as-possible but I actually quite like the combo of meat-bread-slaw-sauce this sandwich delivers--no spice needed.  The fries are greaaaaaaaaaat, too.  Some day I'll try some of this Texas sausage, 'cause it sounds great.  Mum liked her food too - tho she's generally easy to please.   The toughest critic was the 6 year old, who deemed the mac and cheese delicious, and wanted to know if I had any idea what the ""secret ingredient"" was in the mac and cheese.  I ventured that it might be butter, and he agreed... until we had been there for a while, the mac and cheese got cold, and then his decree shifted from delicious to disgusting in one drop.  Can't please all the people all the time, I guess.

2009-06-19,4.0,"With its trendy spelling, I expected the inside of Smoque to be some kind of Nouvelle Barbeque experience. And am I ever glad it's not! The inside is that of a simple, functional joint: tables and chair a little too close together, a self-serve machine for fountain drinks, and a counter where you place your order, pay your money, and pick up the goods when they call your name. How's the food? Mostly fantastic. Since I live west of the city, I usually get my BBQ fix at Famous Daves (used to go to Robinson's, but they've really slipped). And while FD's ribs, sides, variety of sauces, and service are always enjoyable, there's something else going on at Smoque that really knocked me out: depth. Where some ribs might offer you mostly the flavor of its sauce, the St. Louis ribs I had at Smoque had a deep smokiness that permeated the meat, followed by a savory and spicy rub, before I even got to the flavor of the sauce! Oh, and though Smoque doesn't have a table-full of sauces to choose from, the one they give you is worth a table full -- it's excellent. So the ribs alone were worth five stars. Several of the sides were up to this same high standard. The baked beans were delicious and sweet, with flavorful meat and carmelized onions. The french fries were terrific. And the peach cobbler in individual-size tins looked small but turned out to be the perfect size after gorging oneself on meat.  In our visit, there were only a couple of misses: the Texas Sausage and the Brisket Chili were both perfectly fine but not home runs. Service, by the way, turned out to be an unexpected surprise. When I was undecided between St. Louis and Baby Back Ribs, the unassuming mustachioed manager on the floor guided me to the former. And when the counter girl rang us out without beverages after mistakenly telling me they didn't have diet fountain drinks -- before I noticed that the fountain machine had Diet Coke clearly labeled -- Mustache Guy quickly gave me two cups.

So far, the best brisket I have liked has been home crafted by true BBQ  lovers or a couple of joints in Texas, but the brisket here is actually the best I have ever had.  Pulled pork was surprisingly sub-par. With all the place had going for it, it was a bit dry and tasted only like sauce (which is tasty) but not the porky goodness that I love. Served on a giant bun of Hawaiian bread that added a nice sweetness but was too fluffy and should have probably been a bit denser.  The ribs (the larger St. Louis style) I love were great. Perfectly tender. There is this disgusting love for 'fall off the bone' ribs that makes people boil ribs to cook them then throw them in a smoker or on a grill. Boiled meat, people? What, are we English? no dude, it's gotta be smoked and thiers are amazingly tender but not sodden. really good and served with the Memphis style BBQ sauce. They have 2 sauces - Memphis style: sweet, molasses-y, thick and the South Carolina: thinner and vinegar-y. I usually prefer the tangier S Carolina, but theirs is tangy, but not much smoke or spice - The fell I was with said it was good on whatever he was eating. I found it to be 'meh' I actually really enjoyed the Memphis style - well balanced, smoky and not too sweet. Good texture too; stuck to my meat but not gooey. The baked beans...that was an odd story. My first bite was heaven. They were amazing. But I couldn't take more than 2 or 3 bites at a time before I was bored with them. It's an interesting taste, but they were almost too sock it to me and didn't have much of a 'beany' flavor.  So it was nibble something, take a bite of beans. leave them alone for a while, go back to them, have a couple of bites etc. Weird, huh? mac and cheese had a delicious buttery crumb topping, but otherwise only a bit above mediocre.  What most BBQ places do is make a couple of sauces and then douse everything int he sauce: all the meats, the beans, the sausages. Great if you love the sauce! This place had very unique tastes to all the food. The brisket, ribs, pork, beans, all were unique and that is a new thing to me in the BBQ world. Unfortunately some of them missed the mark - but not by enough  not to come back.  The biggest thing is that everything is a bit too much, except the noble simple coleslaw which is simple and palate cleansing.  You already heard it's crazy crowded with a few tiny tables. It's BYOB, but too busy to kick back and enjoy a brew. Eat and run style. Staff is friendly and helpful.

Everyone raves over the mac and cheese but I find it slimy and gross; the fries are soggy and dense; the baked beans are overly sauced and I can't taste the bean. The pulled pork and beef brisket are amazing and perfect and all that, but they use that Hawaiian style of bread, which I don't think works with BBQ; the sweetness of the bread combined with the sweetness of the sauce just makes the whole thing too sugary. I also never really care for a soft roll with loose meat. I need something firm in a sandwich, whether it's the bread or the stuff inside the bread. Overall, Smoque just doesn't quite do it for me.

Many years later, I made a habit of Lee's and Dee's in St. Paul.  Small, unassuming, great ribs.  You can sit in silence off Selby Ave. and lick your fingers all you want.     I would never lick my fingers at Smoque.  There are too many watchful eyes, judging your every move.  Too many people extolling the virtues of barbecue.  People upon people.  Milling about, eating barbecue, checking to make sure your dining experience is all you'd hoped.  At times, awkwardly touching your hunched shoulders.   For me, this is a turnoff.  When faced with barbecued/smoked meat products, I need solitude.  I need a place where I can give full attention to the task at hand.  Namely, cementing my status as a decorated member of the clean plate club.   Don't get me wrong, the food was great.  It just seemed like there wasn't enough of it.  The brisket was extremely tender.  In the future I may just buy a pound or two of this, instead of doing the sandwich thing.  The bread seems to overshadow the star of the show.

Chicago has had a few greats that fit this category too (.. the original Hecky's on Greenbay, Leon's on the south side... Oh Edith! We miss you so!). Smoque is not this. It doesn't have that cinematic, ""I've come across something nobody else knows about"" thing. They won't cast Wilford Brimley or Bill Cobbs to play the owner in the movie about this place. But really, who cares? For me its about how the food tastes... period. I don't require the foreplay... just fork over the smokey meats please.  THEIR SAUCE has a kick but is not too spicy... nice and sweet without being too sweet as Chicago places do often... sweeter than Texas style, more kick than KC style.... just right. BRISKET is great! Fatty where you want it fatty, flavorful, smokey, tender... this is great stuff. RIBS are smokey and pink... tender... dry served with sauce on the side for dipping... very meaty and very delicious! BEANS may be the best thing in the place.... smokey and fatty and onion-y... yum! COLESLAW is a very minimal vinegar chopped cabbage with a little purple onion and that's it... very fresh and crunchy... not huge on flavor and not for everybody... but good pallet cleanser and heat relief. PULLED PORK is good but I think the brisket is the better choice here. CHICKEN.... chicken? Who orders chicken in a place like this?! It did LOOK good but sorry... can't waste my plate space on chicken.... maybe someday I'll try it..... FRIES are great... crunchy, yummy.... not an afterthought as with many other pure breed BBQ places.. PEACH COBBLER will have you weeping... delicious!... and served piping hot... damn!...

2009-05-16,4.0,"I have eaten at the Salt Lick in Austin, TX more times than I can remember.  I used to think they had the best BBQ in all the land, but now I must confess that Smoque is vying for that sauce-slathered place in my heart.  Their brisket is amazing - it comes out hot and tender with a sauce that compliments it well.  The sausage is delicious and authentically Texan.  Their mac and cheese is wonderful, their cobbler quite tasty and their coleslaw is some of the only slaw I've ever liked.   So what's holding them back?  A sad absence of pickles, onions and potato salad.  Then again, the owner (manager?) said it's perfectly fine to bring my own jar of pickles next time, so bonus points for Smoque.  I'm serious about the potato salad, though - a Texas BBQ dinner just isn't complete without it!   Oh, and you may also end up waiting for anywhere from 10 minutes to half an hour depending on when you arrive, and end up sitting quite closely to some strangers.  But that's just how things are done when it comes to Texas BBQ, from my experience, so I didn't think too much of it.  Sucks in the winter to wait outside, but you can always call ahead for pick up or to check if they haven't run out of brisket (or whatever is your fancy).",0.9923,0.782,0.185,0.033,0.549122807017544

Puh-lese.  The meat is all very moist and wet tasting and all, but almost completely devoid of seasoning or meaty flavor. Could be beef. Or pork. Maybe chickenish? The ""peach cobbler"" needs to change its name to ""peach crisp"" with a quickness, or else one of these days somebody's moms is going to whoop someone's ass up in there on principle - oats and nuts and shit do not a cobbler make, but the mini cupcake tin of it tasted pretty okay. But it's still not cobbler. I had to track down some Tabasco to liven up the weak sauces. Fries are really really great. Coleslaw is not.  I like the kids' menu. But seriously - seriously - What is up with the jail-looking, prison-issueish, quasi-thali-esque presentation of the food here? Tin tray , lined with wax paper, meat lumped directly on that paper? Like the paper is the plate? And then tiny little tin muffin tins of sides. Is that supposed to be ""authentic""? Authentic what? (-sigh-I probably really don't want to know, do I?) Look, I've lived in multiple areas of the south, and they do have themselves a lot of fucking problems, but they do (for the most part) use plates.

Okay, so at a real bbq place, like Barbara Ann's or something, that would be like Big Mama Thorton and the Bellboys would be like The Patio or Arby's or Famous Daves or something.  Smoque would be almost like Elvis.  And what's wrong with that, right?

Smoque served up some delicious briskets.  I got the brisket platter (half chopped, half sliced), cornbread, and peach cobbler with a taste of Texas sausage.  OMG!  The savory brisket melts in your mouth, especially the sliced brisket.  I much prefer the sliced over the chopped brisket.  The Texas Sausage was a little spicy and was perfectly grilled.  The peach cobbler, oh peach cobbler... was fantastic!  Sweet and sour and crunchy...  The flavors and texture just blends together so well in your mouth.  The cole slaw was good as well.  I like that it's not a creamy slaw (although I like that too).  But it's good the way they make it here! The restaurant was packed and with a group of 7 people, I had no hope of getting a table.  But magically they got a table big enough for 7 of us!  That's cool!  The guys who cleans and assign tables are cool!  Funny, courteous, and pleasant.  It's kinda nice to feel welcomed at a busy place like that. The only complaint I had was that some of the patrons would just sit there yapping away with their friends long after they've finished eating and their plates taken away.  Come on people!  Have some courtesy for your fellow hungry diners, and get your full-asses out of the restaurant so that other people can sit down.  It is ok to stand outside and talk.  It won't kill you...  Oh, I wish they'd convert the back parking lot into an outdoor patio.

The waiting in line part just adds to the anticipation. I have been here many times. I usually like to get the ribs or the pulled pork sandwich, the mac & cheese (creamy), the baked beans (best I've ever had in life), the cornbread (sweet and fresh),  and the fries (freaking amazing- nice and crispy).  Smoque needs to open another location- quickly.  My words of advice for you:  Don't get the peach cobbler - it is more like a peach crisp. There is not any crust or dough parts inside. For me, that's key.  Go during off hours- before or after a typical dinner rush. I usually  like going during the week around 8pm or on a Sunday at 3 in the afternoon.

2009-05-01,4.0,"Food:  The food really makes this place (Note-  it's BYOB).  You can tell from the moment you walk in the door, the owners, cooks & cashiers are 100% focused on food.  I don't typically crave bbq, but I've started to now.  I sampled the pulled pork, chopped brisket, hotlink, ribs, coleslaw, mac n cheese, baked beans & cornbread - yummy!  The baked beans were a little heavy on the onion & the mac n cheese was more fluffy than creamy (from all the butter, I'm guessing) but all the flavors blended nicely.  The name was definitely the staple behind the meat flavor, but I had been hoping for a little more of a smokey crust to the meat.  There wasn't much of a crust, making me wonder if it'd been sitting for a while.  Maybe it's better during peak busy hours (I was there at 4:30pm on a Friday) but even without the crunch, I would go back - oh, and get the peach cobbler. Atmosphere: Small town feel in bustling Chicago; always busy but usually in a friendly way.  Cafeteria style seating can be tricky for shy folks, but doesn't bother me any. This place is down to earth and all about the food - which gives me confidence in going back again and again.  I wouldn't bring a date here for the first date unless he/she had moved from Memphis and was feeling homesick, but I would come back to meet friends and family. Parking:  Street parking during business hours, and there is a small parking lot behind the restaurant that's available after hours.  You might have to walk & if that bothers you, you shouldn't be going here anyway - there'll probably be a line to get in. Price: Moderate; you get a lot of meat for your money, but the sides are pretty small for the price, so I suppose it all evens out. Service: For my friend and I, there wasn't a lot of service involved - walk in, order food, sit down, eat, and leave.  Everyone was friendly though, from the Cashiers to the busboys.  I liked it and will be back.",0.9941,0.824,0.149,0.027,0.43367003367003376

Went with my parents a couple of weekends ago. I got a half slab of Baby Backs and a half slab of St. Louis Styles. Both were phenomenal. The meat has fantastic flavor without any sauce because of the rub, and with the sauce, it was even better.   I prefer baby back because the meat is much more tender and falls off the bone, but St. Louis style was very good as well -- just had to put a little more effort into it. Sauce was more peppery than vinegary -- very full of flavor with a little kick. If you ONLY like sweet sauce, you might not like it. But if you're open to your sauce opportunities, you'll be very happy. The mac and cheese was tremendous. I loved the fact that there were bread crumbs on it -- made it that much more flavorful and added another texture element that makes you ask, ""Why didn't I do this with my Easy Mac?"" My mom got the brisket, which was awesome. Not overly tough or chewy like most brisket I've ever had, and it's very flavorful with a nice charred crust. Pricewise, it's not too expensive, about what you would expect to pay for a full rack of ribs (I think the ribs are about $17 a la carte, $21 for ribs with two sides).

Pulled pork - FUHMAZING. Loved that. Still tasted great the following day as leftovers. Threw it on some toast and wah-lah! Breakfast, so good! The brisket I wasn't impressed with, but I've never tried it before, so maybe that's the best it can be? I thought it was dry with strips of redeeming fat on its sides to moisten and flavor it up. Coleslaw - so fresh, nice and tangy and just perfect with all that pork grease. One of the best ever. Cornbread - eh. Thought it was too greasy - it's cornbread! Why is it so greasy?!?!?! Wasn't thrilled with the mac and cheese, but the fries were right on. All in all, will go again! It's not the best BBQ I've eaten, but it's solid and definitely one of them.

I got the sliced brisket platter which came with coleslaw and 2 sides which I choose to be the brisket chili and the mac n cheese. I also got a taste of pulled pork. 1. sliced brisket Extremely tender, could barely pick it up with my fork. had good flavor. first brisket i've ever had so I didn't have anything to compare it too but It wasnt as juicy as I had hoped but it was by no means dry. Decent size portion with the slaw and 2 sides. 4/5 2. coleslaw DAMN good slaw. I believe I am the slaw nazi because I am always critical of it, and I don't like vinegar based so much, but boy do they know what they are doing. Simple. One type of cabbage chopped not shredded like crazy, and some thinly sliced red onion. Little bit of pepper the slightly vinegary base, can't go wrong. Not drenched not too peppery. Only complaint was that I wanted MORE! 5/5 3. mac n cheese Tiny portion, but ooooh so good. Nice breadcrumb crust on top and very creamy in the middle. You can tell its homemade, because of the color and flavor (real cheese), and can taste the love. Again only complaint tiny portion which i'm going to say takes half a point this time. 4.5/5 4. brisket chili Good spices, decent heat, nice sized bowl. Hardly any meat though just basically tomatoes and spices with a chili like broth. Tasty but not a chili that one should be proud of. The one low point of the meal. 2.5/5 5. pulled pork Good pulled pork. You can defiantly taste the smoke especially in the dark crust which tastes like a smokey bacon. The flavor was a bit one dimensional though. 3.5/5 Overall a pretty good place, might not go out of my way to get back there but after a sox game sure. Good price for lots of good food, about 12 dollars for all of that plus a drink.

Although my country style ribs, tenderly loved and slow cooked, are the talk of family, friends and neighbors (straight southerners - which is a compliment), I have yet to get all into the ""BBQing every part of a cow and pig"" . I promise to do so this summer .... No, you are not invited.  At work that morning I was going through reviews on Cuban food when for some odd reason, I ended up looking at a bunch of BBq reviews. I get home and tell my wife to pack up the lil hunie and we headed off to Smoque. I have to admit that the first reviews were given to us by my in-laws about 1 year ago. When we first walked in, I finally understood why people are always touching on the space issue. Yes, it is fairly small and thinly furnished, which is fine with me. Luckily we went around 4pm and it was pretty empty....Goood! The crew was all smiles and seemed upbeat, which is a plus when we visit a new place. Smiles make reviews like this, go up that half a star.  The food -  Places that get this much attention, usually worry me because they quickly forget about the quality and go for the profits. That was not the case with smoque. We ordered the full slab of baby back ribs, (sides-included) mac and cheese (of course), BBQ beans, cornbread and fries. First off , the mac and cheese is yummy. I rate my mac and cheese on crust only, which this one - had the best. The beans were good but my wife (the bean lover) did not have much of a reaction from them, so I will leave them as OK. The ribs were very tasty and cooked with just the right amount of burn to them. The ribs get a thumbs up from me. I ordered some brisket but in the rib eating frenzy, it got cold, I will leave that rating out. I asked my wife if she wanted to try the pulled pork and she gave a ""I am about to explode"" yes.

Smoque can hold their own with the best of them, and I'm not talking Chicago bbq standards.  These people are making bbq RIGHT, Mason Dixon line be damned.  The very best ribs I've ever had in Chicago and, in fact, some of the best I've had anywhere, period.  I got the combo baby back/St. Louis and, although both were excellent, definitely favor the St. Louis style. The brisket...oh...perfect pink smoke ring, gorgeous bark, tender juicy meat.  There isn't a brisket in town that can top it.  The Texas Link IS a Texas Link.  Holy moly, I thought I was at some German smokehouse in Texas when I ate that thing - beautifully marbled with fat, smokey, juicy, and a natural casing that gives it a fantastic snap. I'm a happy girl. Sides are also good, I particularly recommend the baked beans which are studded with chunks of porky goodness.  My husband hated the mac and cheese, I loved it.  In fact, I loved it even more on the 2nd day, it's good stuff.  The coleslaw is of the vinegar/pepper based school, not my fave, but has very finely shaved bits of red onion in it that really makes it shine.  In fact, the only thing I've had here that could even be qualified as a disappointment is the pulled pork.  Delicious, but not nearly as good as the rest of their menu.  That fantastic smokey flavor you find in all of their other offerings is lost on this dish.  It's still tender and good, just lacking a bit of oomph/flavor.  It is the one item here that I actually needed to put sauce on. The sauce, btw, is fantastic, but I definitely prefer the lighter Carolina based one.  My one quibble is the lack of white bread - god intended us to eat white bread with our BBQ, dammit, could you just dole out a couple of slices of wonder bread with the cue, please? Pricey, but 1 rib dinner, 1 brisket dinner and a side of pulled pork and a Texas link fed myself and my husband for nearly 3 days, so overall a very good value.  Compared to my beloved Salt Lick, this is a four star joint.

But I was able to order Smoque's chopped brisket sandwich with cole slaw and brisket chili (Wednesday's special side dish) [$8.95]. Soft drinks (Coca-Cola products) are $1.25.  I was here at 3:10 pm. There was no queue out the door, and lots of seating choices inside. The brisket was good. It needed the additional B-B-Q sauce (a sweet sauce - provided) to enhance it. I also thought that it seemed to get cold around the edges of the bun. The cole slaw is the vinegar-based kind, which is not my favorite, but it was fresh, and I finished it all anyway. The brisket chili was quite good. It had a meaty flavor, even before I scooped up the shredded beef which had fallen out of my sandwich and tossed that into it. Every day, there is one custom side dish. If this is available when you visit here, you should opt for it. I am giving Smoque a four-star rating because the food is quality, its prices are average, and it successfully conveys the atmosphere of a communal dining room, which is something you infrequently glimpse in metropolitan Chicago. Transit options: This is an intermodal venue. There are many ways to get here. I'll change it up this time by telling you something significant if you decide to drive here. Because Smoque is so close to the Union Pacific Northwest line, the Irving Park Blue Line ""L"" station, and the Kennedy Expressway; but is in a residential neighborhood; there are parking restrictions on Grace St. [one way westbound], and Keystone Ave. [one way northbound] Smoque's own parking lot is only six spaces. You want to approach Smoque from the northwest; either on Irving Park Rd., or off the Kennedy at Keeler. The avenue you want to wind up on is _Avondale Ave._ It is the diagonal street on the south side of the U.P. railroad tracks. _It is one way southeastbound._ After 8:00 am, there are no parking restrictions on Avondale. Cram your vehicle into any spot you can find. Then, you'll face a one-to-two block walk. Lest you perceive I am making a fuss about this; Smoque's own pamphlet illustrates the parking situation. Lucidly, transit is overwhelmingly available. The route #53 Pulaski bus stops in front of the venue. The Irving Park Blue Line ""L"" station has an auxiliary exit at Pulaski. (A 1 1/2 block walk.) Route #80 and #X80 Irving Park buses are two blocks north. The terminus of the route #54A North Cicero bus [pm rush hours only] is three blocks northwest. Even the U.P. has a train station here {for you reverse commuters entering the city on the Metra $5.00 Weekend Pass}. But make sure you don't visit here on Monday.

Once you get over the unbearable whiteness of being (a snazzy bbq in Old Irving Park while Honey I et al. struggle elsewhere), it's not hard to appreciate that Barry and Co. are the area's best emulators, which is saying something, given how many false promises of real 'cue this city has gotten before. Best news: this is not boiled meat jello. It's not Hill Country, but it's probably as close as we'll get it: the brisket is, as noted before, excellent; sauce comes on the side, thank cheesus; ribs are pink-y and have an excellent chew (I sound like Pat Bruno, sorry). Sides are not ignored, surprising for a BBQ joint; go for the beans.

First of all, I can't believe how close this place is to our house! Just 10 mins away. Second of all it's easy to miss this place when you're driving because it's at the corner and there isn't any bold sign illuminating out in front. Third, you will not regret eating here! When you come in, you're suppose to go to the counter, place your order, pay and find a table to sit at and eat. Everything is made to order and they will shout your number out when it's done. I had the pulled pork sandwich with an add on of ribs and their mac and cheese. Tamia had their ribs. Tony had their chopped beef brisket an add on of ribs and a side of peach cobbler. Goodness, my sandwich was just piled high with pulled pork. I took some of my cole slaw and add it on to my sandwich and spread their delicious bbq sauce on the bun. It was wonderful. Pure delicious! Their mac and cheese was perfect! Moist, cheesy and addicting. Tamia was loving her ribs and the bbq sauce so much that she asked her father for his! Tony enjoyed his food. He was very amazed of their peach cobbler that he decided to share it with Tamia and I. Bad news, Tamia and I devoured it without asking him if he wanted a second helping. =) The price is reasonable and the service is awesome.  Also, this Tuesday we had order take out from them. We had their sliced beef brisket sandwich, ribs, texas sausage, peach cobbler (and order of 3 of course), and their side of fries. Again, everything was great..actually their sliced beef brisket sandwich is way better than their chopped version. The texas sausage was so good, smokey and peppery. Obviously, Tamia claimed her ribs and a side of peach cobbler. Everything was made right and nothing was soggy not even the fries when we took it home. Ah, now if only they would make bigger portion size of their peach cobbler or at least topped it with a scoop of vanilla icecream. *wishful thinking*",0.9973,0.797,0.176,0.028,0.6146798029556649

I have to have baked beans when I come here.  They have the perfect flavor and are infused with smoke.  The macaroni and cheese is so good too.  I like to eat a little bit and then wait for it to cool down so the cheese is not runny.  It tastes like macaroni and cheese cake!   My husband loves the peach cobbler and eats it first because that is when it tastest the best.

One problem that I've noticed, it seems as though at dinner time the only cashier has to ring up both to-go orders and sit down orders.  This takes up a lot of time and causes people to wait more than they would have to if they had a separate person ring up only to-go orders. It seems to get bussiest around 5:30 pm on the Weekend nights and around 12:00 pm for lunch.  Busy means that a line has started that goes out of the building.  I would try to go before these times to avoid a wait.

I didn't think the much-heralded mac n cheese lived up to expectations, but the vinegary cole slaw was out of this world.

We arrived about 5pm on a Sunday and did get into a parking spot in the lot just west of the building they are in.  We had to stand outside about 5 minutes before getting inside and then I guess it was about 20 minutes (maybe a bit longer) before placing the order.  But the time is welcomed as you are trying to figure out what you want. We decided on a 1/2 x 1/2 of the baby back and the st louis.  I am not sure the difference but the longer chewier ones I liked better.  The only thing I would knock on the ribs is that the flavor of smoke for me was slightly more intense than I liked but I would positively make the drive to come here just for the food. We also did the Add a taste for like $3 where you can get the brisket or pulled pork.  The brisket you get a choice to have it sliced or chopped and we got chopped.  I think I would have preferred sliced but it was good.  I liked the pulled pork better than the brisket.  It seems that with BBQ it is hit and miss on the pulled pork and brisket. We did both.  Sides we got: Fries (Excellent)/Mac n Cheese (Excellent but kids did not like) and the Corn Bread (excellent).  I heard a couple of people by us saying something about the peach cobbler so I which I would have tried that but I guess it gives me a reason to go back. The service here was outstanding.  The owner is constantly sizing the situation and planning where everyone will sit.  He is also making sure that everyone is happy.  Others are working to make sure the tables are turned quickly but in no way do you feel pressured.,0.9891,0.825,0.135,0.04,0.6538181818181819

The portions for the meat were very generous but my friend and I both thought the portion on the sides was on the small side. We both agreed that the mac n cheese was great.

My problem with this place are their sides.  It's my personal belief that one of the best thing about ribs are the sides that it comes with.  There is nothing like a side of mac and cheese or baked beans to compliment your ribs.  Here, the sides are simply disappointing.  I tried most of their sides, and they were all a miss with the exception of their french fries, which isn't even a true side when paired with ribs. There aren't very many choices of food here either, so come here only if you are looking for ribs and not much more.  Their brisket was not flavorful enough for me, although cooked to true tenderness.  They definitely know how to cook their meats.

Perhaps it is because I am from Texas where BBQ is king or I think that when you throw down $10 you should be given more food than you can eat, but Smoque did not satisfy my expectations. I got the Brisket Platter with two sides. The first side which was Mac and Cheese was great. The second side of the day which was Brisket Chili was unimpressive. This was more soupy than it was chili and it didn't really have the smoked meat flavor permeating the item The brisket itself was average. The meat was tender, but not as flavorful as I would have liked. The smoked essence essential in BBQ was not evident. The BBQ sauce was watery and did not have anything distinctly special about it. All in all for BBQ in Chicago the meal was good, but for BBQ overall it just doesn't even come close to a place south of the Mason-Dixon line.",0.9153,0.86,0.098,0.042,0.45845004668534084

The sauce had a great mix of flavors.  I decided to get the beans as my side. They were excellent! Great flavor and just the right texture.  The other side that came with the sandwich was the coleslaw. I normally like the creamy style better, but this tangy and not creamy coleslaw was really good.  I can't wait to try some of the other foods offered. I really like ribs, so that will be my future taste.  The interior was nice and had a good down to earth plain decor. The people were very nice and helpful. They did a good job of managing the flow of people.  One thing to know. I passed the place by.

It was no bullshit BBQ--I can dig that.  They were out of a lot of things that late in the night, but pulled pork is good for me. It was really, really good. I'm no pulled pork expert but it made my tummy happy. On the side I had this tiny baked mac and cheese pastry cup. It was the cutest thing. I love mac  and cheese but I feel like whenever you order a side of it, its never that good. This one was delicious, with crumbs on top--and so cute! The coleslaw was also phenomenal. Lost of pepper and red onion really gave it that kick. We ordered our food at the counter and even though the place was jam packed, they sat us right away. A few minutes later we had our food.

We ordered the St. Louis ribs and brisket with sides of mac & cheese, beans, cole slaw, cornbread and for dessert: peach cobbler.  Even on a snowy cold day, this place was busy so I can only imagine what it's like when the weather is nice. In those instances, I would order take out for sure. Although it was teeming with people, the host easily found us a seat and overall, the service was incredibly attentive and kind. That always wins extra points in my book.  But back to the most important part of Smoque -- the food. The ribs are cooked in a dry rub so don't expect messy, saucy ribs. They are tender and flavorful, with a sweet sauce on the side. The brisket was equally tender. It could have benefited from a bit more fat, and the accompanying sauce had a little too much acidity for my taste, but they were still good eats. The sides really stole the show. The mac & cheese is probably the best I've had in Chicago (thus far); the beans have a rich smokiness and some pork mixed in; the slaw, although not creamy, was crispy and fresh; and the cobbler was deeeelicious with a thick, crispy crust and firm, fresh peaches.

Their brisket is pure Texas.  Slow smoked, tender, and juicy.  The ribs are straight out of St. Louis with a delicious dry rub.  Have the sauce on the side and try 'em ""dry"" so to speak.  Don't let the sauce obscure the amazing flavors of smoke, and the lip-smacking unctiousness of the pork.  And the pulled pork tastes almost exactly like the style from my hometown in Georgia.   I also think that as far as thick sauces go, Smoque's got one of my fav's.  It's not the syrupy sweet super thick sauce that you wind up buying at the supermarket, nor is it the thin vinegar and mustard based sauce of my childhood.  It's it own beast of delicious tangy flavor with a hint of sweetness.  I like to tear down my rack of ribs and dip just a bit in the sauce, so that I get a hint of the sweetness to accentuate the savory.   So do what I said in the first sentence.   Just go.

On a Sunday evening at 7:00 P.M., I met friends there and found the line extending just outside the door. It took about 30-minutes to reach the cashier to place our order. There was an employee keeping tabs on the line trying to arrange proper seating for the groups. I counted at least 14-employees, which I find incredible for a restaurant of this small size. I would estimate the restaurant occupies no more than 2,000 square feet. I doubt the seating capacity exceeds 50 - 60 patrons. You place your order with a cashier, find a seat and wait for your number to be called. Once you place your order, there isn't much of a wait. Fountain drinks are self-service and located close to diners. I ordered a sliced brisket sandwich with cole slaw and baked beans. My wife ordered a pulled-pork sandwich with cole slaw and macaroni and cheese. We shared a small order of fries. The brisket was servied on a soft, dinner-style bun. The meat was flavorful, tender and smokey. It wasn't drenched in BBQ sauce, but we were each provided with extra sauce in a plastic container. The sauce is thin and vinegar-based--southern style. The cole slaw is also vinegar-based and very sweet. The baked beans were very smokey--much too smokey for my taste. The french fries were fresh cut and served in a small paper bag. They were excellent, except this batch was over salted. The pulled pork was flavorful with a nice crust of bark. Our tab was under $23.00. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I had hoped for a better dining experience. With painted concrete floor and metal roof ceiling, the crowded restaurant was loud and difficult to carry on a conversation. Although a patron standing in line interrupted our meal to ask about the french fries. Barry, one of the owners, stopped by to ask how everything was. He was friendly and proud of his food and spoke about their efforts to maintain consistency.  How to improve things (IMHO)... Find a larger location with adequate parking. It took ten to fifteen minutes to find a place to park on the street and another thirty minutes to reach the cashier to place my order. Cut back on the smoke a little--especially on the baked beans.

2008-11-15,5.0,"This place... well, this is why I'm making a profile on Yelp.   When I was growing up in southern California, my dad, after leaving Tennessee, took it as a sacred mission to introduce me and my little brother to proper barbeque.  When we'd go back during the summers, we got barbeque there, but it took years of searching to find good barbeque nearer home.  He finally found a really good barbeque place eventually, about thirty miles from our neighborhood, but it's unfortunately now closed.   So anyway, I take barbeque seriously.   Smoque is probably the best barbeque joint I have ever been to.   Now, the atmosphere isn't absolutely perfect, but it works, and wow, is that food incredible!  Their menu is the basics of barbeque.  So far I've had the brisket and the St. Louis ribs.  Both are spectacular.  I have never had ribs with better texture, they're just cooked perfectly.  The meat is excellently flavored, but it's almost a side act to the sauce.  This rib sauce is the best I've ever tasted, it is absolutely amazing.  The brisket sauce is less striking, but it's busy taking a backseat to the meat.  The brisket is almost falling apart, and can actually take a little work to eat with a fork, but is somehow not overcooked.  It's got a wonderfully slow flavor, and my girlfriend will testify that I sat there just staring off into space as each bite worked its way on through to a perfect smoky aftertaste.   Now, there's the matter of the sides.  They're all incredible.  I'd like it if the place had potato salad, but I would be forced to take another couple minutes to decide on my sides each time if it did.  The owner, who is constantly circulating, making sure everyone's doing well, stops to talk to customers constantly, and when he stopped by our table mentioned that they're working on a potato salad.  With as much work as they've clearly put into the other sides, I'm very much looking forward to it, since I'll be going back regularly.   The coleslaw is pitch perfect, tangy rather than sweet, and very simple.  It cuts the flavor of the meat just right.  Every so often I'd swing over to the coleslaw for a moment, and going back to the meat was like taking a first bite all over again, and that's something you'll probably appreciate as much as I did.  The mac and cheese is great, crusted with bread crumbs and dense cheese sauce, the cornbread is excellent, and the fries are simple quality, but if you pass up the ridiculously wonderful cobbler for them you'll regret it.  Get the cobbler.  The baked beans are unusual, with an almost apple flavor and chunks of onion, but definitely good.  They're probably not for everyone, but I liked them a lot.   Oh, and get a sausage on the side.  They ship it in from Texas, and it's worth it.   The location is a little inconvenient, but it's well worth it.  The place could use a better sign for anyone coming from the north.  Even if you don't see it, just make a right on the first little street that isn't right up against the freeway embankment.  Still, the place is only a couple years old, the prices are reasonable, the service is good, and I'm looking forward to filling in any gaps when I go back yet again.",0.9981,0.754,0.184,0.061,0.535513184990797

I think the Brisket is great.  Really the only place in Chicago that comes close to the brisket I would get when I travelled to Texas for work.  I also like the fact they have St. Louis style ribs.  One thing of note is the cole slaw. I hate creamy style slaw due to my aversion of all things mayo.  If you like a vinegar based slaw give it a try (though the slaw at White Fence Farms is better). Update.

You may want to consider taking the food to go as the place gets uber crowded & it rather small on the inside.  Also, try & get there early or else you will be standing in one long line.  This joint is pretty casual & the seating is not the best--it is like a cafeteria with long tables where you can sit right on top of people.  If you don't mind that, I say check them out--you probably wont be sorry.",0.9839,0.823,0.161,0.016,0.616774891774892

2008-09-03,3.0,"Yes! A barbecue joint by my place! I was so excited to check it out but after experiences with them, I can only sum it up as a ""just OK"" place. The first thing I like to try when I find a new BBQ joint is their tips and links combo. So I look up at the huge chalkboard menu trying to find it....not on the menu?! Impossible! After a couple of minutes of careful study of the board, I had to settle for the half baby back, half St. Louis rib dinner. Then I found out that they can, and do run out of food for the day. I was told they were out of baby back ribs.  So I settle for the St. Louis ribs. And I was not impressed. The rub on the ribs was only OK. The meat itself was just OK. I smelled the sauce that comes on the side. Smelled great, so I poured it on my ribs. And it proceeded to run all down my fingers onto my hands. The darn sauce is too thin! Not cool. Hopefully it'll wake up the flavor of the meat. I took a bite of the sauce-soaked meat, and it was a tad bit better. But I'd have to say that it's best to stay away from the ribs, at least the St. Louis ones. I faired a lot better the second time around. I'm not a fan of pulled pork, so I ordered the sliced brisket sandwich. Best beef brisket sandwich I've had so far. The meat was delicious and cooked to perfection. I have to give them props for the mac and cheese. It is awesome! Too bad they give you so little of it. I'll have to order an extra next time. And the cole slaw was fresh, tasty, and zesty. I prefer a creamy slaw, but their slaw was very good. The fries instantly reminded me of Jimmy's fries, except, they were not as good as Jimmy's. The place is not very pleasing to the eyes, if you care to dine in.

Anything would be good after you smoke cook it for fifteen hours, I guess -- so this is actually above and beyond good. Hard to really say anything else about it. You just have to try it for yourself. Take confidence in knowing that I like BBQ, and this is a truly delicious specimen. I also liked the coleslaw. Normally I hate coleslaw.

2008-07-14,2.0,"After several visits to Smoque, I've decided that a review needed to be concocted.  Am I going to tell you to not believe the hype?  To stop wasting your time waiting in line for an hour to get a big pile of brisket?  I'm afraid not.  However, I do have some fundamental issues to address in terms of Smoque's food, identity, authenticity and ambiance.   Let's get down to brass tacks.  I mean, after several visits, i've tried a large variety of things on the menu.  Brisket, links, pulled pork, ribs, and coleslaw.  I wouldn't dare say that any of these items are horrendous or poorly prepared.  Actually, the brisket is quite tasty, albeit incredulously rich.  The ribs and links were also pretty tasty.  Nonetheless, I really have failed to have my mind blown as many reviewers on yelp have.  Like I said, I would consider all of their smoked meats good, but nothing special.  As for the sides, I will say the mac is delicious.   So identity and authenticity?  Yeah, i've got a major bone to pick (no pun intended) with Smoque's whole business plan.  I don't know about yourself, but Barbecue to me is the embodiment of cultural identities throughout America.  It is localized and unique to each state, town, neighborhood and family.  It is something that tells a story and encapsulates a particular history and identity of many people(s).  Call me crazy, but i'm just not getting that sort of atmosphere out of Smoque.  To me, it is a truly Anglicized version of ""barbecue.""  I mean, I really feel like the place and the food is very much contrived.  From the perfect little macaroni tins to the campy metal plate that you're served on, this place is on it's way to becoming Famous Dave's and propped up in every strip mall in Schaumberg.  It's not that the food is bad, but it's the homogenizing of barbecue into one spot.  Don't get me wrong, you can get Carolina style in Chicago.  Except that the owner was originally born in South Carolina, they moved to Chicago and brought all of their recipes and traditions with them.  You see where i'm going?  Texas, St. Louis, Chicago, and Carolina styles all under one roof?  It's just not right like it should be.   The atmosphere is also very much contrived.  It's something between a poorly planned lunch room cafeteria and a Chili's.  The wanna-be 'down-home' charm of rickety tables and too-close for comfort rib sucking is lost on me in a sea of table Nazi's demanding where you sit, excruciatingly blaring audibility and an overall frenzied environment.  It always seems like nobody really knows what's going on and it's not uncommon for someone to be moving tables back and forth throughout the restaurant while you're eating.  As well, it's nice that the owner walks around checking on his customers, but I am left to wonder: Is he strolling the restaurant to check on customers or is he just hoping someone still recognizes him from chillin' with TGIF-Friday's-Sling' Guy Fieri from the Food Network?  Burn.   What can I say?  I'm a bbq purist.  With that being said, i've had better food, authenticity, atmosphere both here in Chicago and elsewhere throughout this Barbecue-laden country.",0.9873,0.845,0.106,0.049,0.5322134038800705

So, I was armed with the address and I made my way down Pulaski from the Blue Line.  It was bright, I had my sunglasses on, I was strutting, saw the address, opened the door, walked in...and it was a dentists office.  I tried to play cool.  I told the receptionists that I was ""meeting a friend.""  Then I had a pretend conversation on my cell phone with my 'friend' saying that ""I was at the office and she could pick me up now..what was that...oh, if you are running late, that is fine.  I'll walk around.  I feel a little awkward waiting at this office anyway...""  And I left.  I am sure the receptionists were laughing at me. Walking next door (and trying to reclaim some cool), I finally entered Smoque.  There were a decent amount of people sitting but still some empty tables.  I sauntered up to the register, ordered a pulled pork sandwich with slaw and fries and a soda.  With tax (hi Todd!), that was $10.14.  Not bad.  I went to the soda fountain, drew some SWEET TEA (the only non-alcoholic beverage to drink with bbq) and sat my happy self down.  Then I remembered I'd been on the CTA and I washed my hands in the restroom.  And used some towellettes.   In the midst of my hand-cleaning OCD, my order number was called!  Immediately, I was impressed by the portion size.  The sandwich is served on a thick wheat bun and there's a more-than-generous amount of pork and sauce awaiting your lips.  Add to that a BROWN PAPER BAG full of fries, container of extra sauce and tub of slaw (with vinegar, not mayo; I hate mayo) and I was ready to dig in.  Remembering my Southern upbringing, I took a bite of my sandwich without adding sauce.  Yum!  Tender, seasoned pork and just the right amount of sauce made for a flavor explosion in my mouth.  Remembering my gluttonous ways, I dumped the rest of the sauce on the sandwich and sopped up any extra that ran off with the bread.  That's how we get down in the dirty dirty.   I assume that I was eating like Homer Simpson because I caught some looks of horror as I gulped down sweet tea, made smacking noises as I ate my sandwich and stuffed fries in my mouth.  I didn't care.  There were free refills to take advantage of and food in front of me to eat.  The looks are deceiving re the portion size.  The folks at Smoque do not skimp on portion size.  I'm a big eater and I was barely able to clean my plate.  I was happy that I didn't order the cobbler, as I would not have been able to eat it.   Since I was in a trance-like state as I gorged, I noticed a few things on the sparsely covered wall.  1.) a crayon drawing done by a child, complete with the word ""Texes.""  It took every bit of my self-control to not turn the ""e"" into an ""a.""  I am still thinking about it. 2.) I couldn't stop giggling at one of the plaques.  It was the EAT OUT AWARD for BEST BUTT.  Hee.  Dirty, but oh-so-humorous to my 12 year old mind, it made me laugh and laugh. One last free refill (and giggle at the best butt to, well, you know) and I was on my way home.  I barely made it back to my place before I passed out from a full belly.  And, ladies & gents, that's good eatin'.",0.997,0.782,0.154,0.064,0.4990353037766832

2008-06-29,5.0,"I've heard a lot about Smoque. But I was skeptical. Could it be as good as Fat Willey's (hands down my favorite BBQ in Chicago)?  We decided to stop by on a whim and get carryout. The place was hoppin'. You order at the counter to get your food, and while there was a line at 5pm on a Sunday, the orders were coming up quick. I got my food in about 5 minutes after ordering even though it was packed. To give it due diligence, I ordered the full slab of ribs (1/2 baby back, 1/2 St. Louis style) with sides of mac and cheese and cornbread. We consumed and digested, and now the verdict is in. I have to say Smoque is every bit as good as Fat Willey's and that it might be a tie as to which I like better. Actually, I would have to have the ribs side by side to make a final decision. But the thing I like about Smoque are the options you have. Picking your sides is great, because the mac and cheese was really good, though I probably wouldn't want a large order of it. And the cornbread was tasty. Only the slaw was average. The ribs were great, both styles. The sauce was good, but did not overpower the meat. And the fact that you can get a half and half order is cool.  Also-BIG PLUS-for $3 extra, you can get a side of beef brisket or pulled pork. I am always in the dilemma of whether I want brisket or just ribs, and this option solved my problem, and for the $3 you definitely get enough to make it worth it. The brisket was excellent as well. The place itself was actually not what I pictured at all. For some reason, I thought it was going to be somewhat more upscale (which for BBQ and the location,  I'm not sure why I thought this). But in fact the inside is as casual and bare bones as it gets. It's all about the food. There are dozens of small tables pushed together to make for a communal, get to know your neighbor, kind of experience. Everyone seemed friendly as well.There were people and kids of all kinds eating here and ordering to go. As far as ambiance, I may prefer Fat Willey's because it is a little more sit down, though casual, and they have outdoor seating and beer. But Smoque has it's own thing going too, and you may prefer to just order your food at the counter, rather than have someone waiting on you. Now the next time I need BBQ, it will be a tough decision.

I see each customer get to the counter and take, what seems to be an eternity to place their order. It is a full 25 minutes before I finally make it to the register to place my order. And, so it goes... Me: ""I'll have the brisket platter with beans and cornbread for the sides."" Smoque (speaking in the drollest possible manner): ""We are out of brisket."" Me (mumbling under my breath): ""Hmm, why didn't you tell me you were out of brisket before I recited my entire order?  Me, again: ""Okay, I'll have the chicken platter with beans and cornbread for the sides."" Smoque: ""We are out of chicken. Basically, all we have is baby-back ribs. We are out of everything else."" Me: ""Thanks for wasting my time!"" as I walked out the door more than slightly pissed off.  I am sure that every customer waiting in that long line experienced the same problem that I encountered when I finally got to the counter to place my order.  I am sure that the baby-back ribs were great. But, I did not want baby-back ribs! And, I would have loved the opportunity to make that decision before Smoque wasted 25 MINUTES of my life waiting in their baby-back rib line.

Minus one eensy weensy star for running out of stuff.  Apparently their smoker capacity can't keep up with demand.  Hopefully they will get more room for more meat asap.

As for my son dairy products list number one on his food pyramid! The family traveled up to the restaurant at about 11:30am on a Friday afternoon and after hearing all of the reviews we wanted some BBQ. At about the time we ordered and were seated by the host the lunch crowd started lining up. Tables can get tight not too mention sparse when groups start piling in to the restaurant. The restaurant was clean and kept clean by the host/bus boy. He had the job of cleaning off tables and seating customers.  I ordered the sliced brisket platter with cornbread and baked beans. The meat was TENDER, the flavor with the sauce served on the side was -Ful as in flavorFul,  but in my opinion the taste was not hitting the spot for me. Corn bread comes served in it's own foil cup and the beans were chock-ful of pieces of pork and onion with just the right sweetness. Cole slaw was fresh and had good proportion of tart and sweet with crunch.  The other items ordered were the Baby back ribs which were also tender and flavorful and the Mac and cheese as mentioned above kid size, with a brisket sandwich (kid size), comes with fresh cut fries.  Please do not get me wrong on this review. All the food was quality, and fresh, and had the yummy factor, but maybe my palate lacks in finesse and I just enjoy barbecue that is slathered with sauce that rhymes with ""Sheet Fabee Ways!""

2008-03-11,5.0,"The food at Smoque is EXCELLENT.  I understand that the long lines, somewhat cramped (when crowded) confines, and the potential for running out of key menu items have the potential to detract from the overall experience (these are the only reasons I'm rating less than 5 stars).  However, food-wise, it's easy to see that all of the negative/mediocre reviews have been written by folks who are either inexperienced in BBQ (particularly the smoked kind) or hold a grudge against the place because of its popularity in the media, and were just looking for some aspect of the restaurant's service or aesthetics to rail against. As for my own opinion, let me just say that beef brisket is one of my favorite foods.  I've cooked it at home (using a recipe that requires 2 days to prepare), I order it frequently at Irish pubs (""corned beef"" is almost always a brisket cut) and Jewish delis, and I have had the ""real BBQ"" brisket in Texas and other parts of the South -- not to mention many joints in Chicagoland and elsewhere.  The brisket at Smoque was at least as good as any I've ever had!  So good -- and so much more enjoyable because of how hard it is find it prepared this perfectly!  I've had plenty of dried-out and/or tasteless and/or overly fatty brisket in my life -- trust me, this is the real stuff, done right. I enjoyed the pulled pork as well -- I can't think of a better place for pulled pork in Chicago, but Smoque's version doesn't really stand out either.  I think that's because pulled pork is a little easier than Brisket to get right (you can easily make a pretty decent ""faux-smoked"" version in any Chicago kitchen just by browning a big pork shoulder roast and then letting it cook all day in the slow-cooker, bathed in about half a bottle of Liquid Smoke -- no other liquid is necessary.  Pull it apart when you're done, and taste the goodness). As for the sides at Smoque, they were great too.  As a Chicagoan I'm a sucker for fresh-cut fries and these were as good as I've had -- the ""small"" is a huge piping-hot bag, liberally seasoned with cracked pepper but not oversalted.  The cornbread and mac-and-cheese were solid too -- very small ""side"" portions of each, but they were rich and tasty enough to make up for that.  I personally don't like cole slaw but my wife enjoyed hers -- she doesn't like the kind slathered in mayo, but this was vinegar-based and hit the spot for her. UPDATE: As of my initial review I hadn't yet tried the ribs or chicken, but we just ordered carry-out last night and got to sample the St. Louis ribs and the smoked chicken.  Both were out of this world good -- and now that I've tried both sauces I can say they're both wonderful.  Thus, despite any misgivings about the ambience of the restaurant, I am compelled to upgrade from 4 stars to 5 stars!",0.9927,0.829,0.129,0.041,0.5786846213895395

The place itself is fairly small, about 15 tables total.  I went at 11:30a thinking i'd beat the lunch rush and there was a line about 5 deep...no worries right?  Well, not really.  Apparently some jack-arse ahead of me ordered, and i kid you not, no less than 20 different things; he walked out with five gianormous bags of food...totally cluster-f'd everything up.  I ended up getting my order at just after Noon and by this time the queue was at least 20 deep with patrons quite visibly annoyed. oh well, such is life....now, let's talk food: again, pulled pork was tender, juicy and succulent with a nice char on a few of the pieces, easily a 5/5.  Love their sauce which was reminiscent of what Smoke Daddy's *used* to be (sadly, they've changed for the worse), semi sweet w. a nice kick to it.     I went with the 2-sides platter and chose fries and baked beans.  To me, sides play a pretty big role at a bbq joint and they delivered another 5/5..out.stan.ding!  Fries were hot and fresh, crispy on the outside steak type fries but not all ""potato-y"" like some steak fries tend to be, very flavorful!   Baked beans were as good as they get, nice hickory flavor, bits of bacon and pork included and a hint of sweetness via brown sugar and other seasoning, incredible.  Cole slaw (included in all platters) was probably some of the freshest i've encountered, light dressing (not mayo based) which I can only compare to my Mom's homemade Poppyseed dressing...again 5/5!   Food 5/5 !!!

2008-01-16,1.0,"***Read my Disclaimer below this review*** Smoque should be fired for having sub par BBQ. I ordered take out for me and my roommate last night. The following is a synopsis of what we ordered and what went horribly wrong. Roomie's Order: Brisket Platter - Not much flavor. Not much meat (won't feed a big burly man). Plus side is that it was tender. BBQ sauce on the side - VINEGARY or something. It smelled bad and tasted bitter. Blah. Fries - Best part of the meal. Still weren't that great, though. Mac n Cheese - Small muffin cup sized portion. Tasted a bit eggy. Coleslaw - VINEGARY again. WTF is it with the Heinz up in here? Ick. My Order: Pulled Pork Sandwich - I would have thought this was chicken. No flavor beyond the bread. Put my own Baby Ray's BBQ sauce but could not salvage the sammich. Fries - see above. Coleslaw - see above. This does NOT compare to Fat Willy's. Fat Willy's has great sauces and their coleslaw is distinctive (I love the cilantro in it). Also, FW has steak fries, which kick Smoque's ash. I will also say that neither FW nor Smoque compares to Famous Dave's, which can be found in/near North Riverside. I will not be eating at Smoque again. It was disappointing. I wasn't expecting Carson's Ribs but hey... it's a bit pricey for getting bland food.  DISCLAIMER: Portage Park restaurants get 4 and 5 stars all the time like they are government cheese. I believe this is due to the niceness of the residents of this area. The sad truth is that Portage Park has very few dining options that will make you salivate. Do not believe all the superb ratings. I would go by the worst review of any given place. I am all for dives, chains, and fancy places. It all depends on your mood. But one thing I look for is good quality for a decent price.",-0.7938,0.819,0.074,0.106,0.5710119047619047

I would have actually given it 3 stars based on the meat alone but I needed to even out this place because to me it definitely did not deserve all the 5 stars it has gotten. I've had MUCH better BBQ that was SO flavorful, and paid a better price for it. I didn't like any of the sides; mac n cheese or coleslaw. Both were bland.

So, I do my part and get in and get out.  Take out has been great.  It's always ready when they say it will be and it's travels well. Tips: 1. When ordering the beef brisket, get the dinner (brisket chopped) and two buns.  It's enough for two sandwiches and cheaper than doing separate orders. 2. If you like mac & cheese, try theirs.  It's good, portioned out -if you are an addict like me, and it's got a great breadcrumb topping. 3.  If you like fresh cut fries, you'll probably like theirs.  However, if you don't like pepper, then don't get them.  They tend to be on the peppery side.",0.9917,0.728,0.218,0.054,0.54375

We drove up to the place and we could tell by the fine smells in the parking lot that it was going to be good.  The line was out the door but moved surprisingly fast. We didn't realize until we got halfway through the line that it was BYOB, but luckily some nice dudes in front of us had an extra cold, six-pack of fat tires in their car they gave us....  i was sad to say they were out of most everything-- pork, st. louis ribs, and others-- they were kind enough to let us know before we got in line, but we stayed anyways. I got the chopped brisket platter and my buddy got the full slab of baby back ribs.  the food comes to you on unpretentious trays and everything is nice and tidily packaged up for you. that is, until you eat. for me, my typical method of attack is to save the main entree for last and hover around the sides for a bit to warm things up. I got baked beans, mac n cheese and cole slaw... and it was good! baked beans probably some of the best I've had... they were sweet and tangy with huge chunks of meat and a great texture. I could have had a tub of those and been satisfied.  the mac was pretty decent and the cole slaw was exactly the way it should be: fresh ingredients with a nice vinegary kick.  on to the meat: my brisket was good. I wouldn't say amazing. It had a really good smoked flavor, even without the sauce. The meat was cooked well... but the sauce really added to the flavor. I believe they had a north carolina sauce for the brisket which had a great balance of sweetness but wasn't too tart, and didn't overwhelm the flavor of the brisket. I'd say for me it was more than above average for sure, but no grand slam however. but my buddy's baby back ribs and sauce: muy rico!!!! the lady said they used a Memphis-style sauce that had just a hint of spices that really hit spot and the meat was fantastic. I like the fact that the ribs had simultaneously a slight crispy outside and fall-off-the-bone quality  inside. it was wonderful, even without the sauce. we feasted quite heartily and after knocking down a few beers left Smoque completely satisfied and hopefully I'll be back for a second visit sometime soon. a word on the service: it was really busy and since you order, get a number and wait for it to get called to go up to the counter to get your food, it had the potential to get really crazy and disorganized. But the few fellas that were helping guide traffic not only did a good job, but they were really friendly and genuinely wanted to make ur dining experience better. one of the guys got a bottle opener for our beers and opened the bottles himself... even though we would have done it ourselves. anyways, I'm not prepared to say just yet that smoque lives up to the hype, but so far so good.

And, as crazy as this may sound... possibly the best french fries I have ever eaten.  A side of fries comes in a large brown paper bag and as much as you think you won't be able to finish them - you'll devour every last one of these crispy, salty, heavenly fries.  The sauce at Smoque is excellent as well - somewhere between a vinegary Carolina style sauce and a sweet smoky Kansas City sauce.  Perfect for dipping the fries into, I might add.  All of this at prices so reasonable you'll s**t a brick.  A full brisket dinner with two sides and coleslaw for under ten bucks.  I have never had better barbecue in the city of Chicago and can think of only one place in the whole country to rival this place (that would be Slow's BBQ in Detroit in case you're wondering.)  If you haven't been here yet and you love BBQ...

Just remember, they're closed on Mondays kids - which is usually a sign of a good restaurant in my book.  If a restaurant isn't open seven days a week, it usually means there is someone there that gives a damn at all times and has to close to get a day off.  And if you don't like crowds, be sure to go at off peak hours like I did.  This place is small, so I'm sure this place gets a bit uncomfortable if crowded.  (((As an added note...

The service was fun and friendly, and the sauce is outstanding. The pulled pork was also excellent, which is saying something because I prefer North Carolina style pulled pork with a vinegar based sauce. The reason I have to ding Smoque is that our ribs were undercooked. We got both baby back and spare ribs, and both needed more time in the smoker. It was a Sunday evening and it was very busy, so I suspect they were pulling the ribs off early in order to feed the crowd. Nonetheless, I was disheartened because I had heard so many rave reviews. Smoque has clearly become a top BBQ destination in the city and you should check it out. I plan to return and give it another try.

Once we parked legally nearby, we came inside the little corner joint. Inside, the restaurant is very plain in its decor. The menu appears on a chalkboard and is easy to figure out.  What you need to know when ordering is that the brisket is either sliced or pulled. I chose sliced since I feared a mouthful of meat imbedded between my teeth. While everyone else in my group of 4 ordered brisket sandwiches, I went with the brisket plate & 2 sides. The brisket is awesome, tender, and charred crisp on the edges the way I love it, for that rich BBQ taste. Definitely a great meal! Following other Yelpers' advice, I avoided ordering the coleslaw, though the guys with me liked it. I may try it next time. I have to say, the sweet and smoky-tasting baked beans are awesome. Likewise, same goes for the fresh-cut, skin-on potato fries that are the best on this side of Gene & Jude's. The corn bread was decent but not mind-blowing.  Free drink refills are a plus.

The brisket was divine--tender, juicy, and oh-so full of flavor. And it was BIG, which I'm grateful for because that day I felt like a pregnant woman in July, craving a side of beef. The mac 'n cheese was excellent. I do, however, wish they offered a little bit larger size than the dixie cup-size that accompanied my meal.

When I go to a bbq joint, I expect it to be a true ""meat & threes"" place.

This place smells GREAT from the street. Even better than San Soo Gab San if that means anything to you. Story time. . .we joined the line out the door at 6:27pm on Memorial Day weekend and stood in light rain for about 10 minutes waiting to get in. While we waited outside the owner appeared and taped an apology on the door for running out of brisket. Ten minutes later he replaced that sign with an out of pulled pork/out of brisket sign. None of this looked good, and some other peeps in line began to scuttle away to their safe little plan B Thai places. Fail. Knowing what was at stake we decided to stick it out. We made it inside and felt the panic and longing as we tried to avoid leering at the other diners gnawing their ribs and stuffing those fat delicious fries down their gullets.

The smoker only holds so much meat, and it bestows its gifts but once a day, and lo it runneth out from time to time, but we decided they post the ""gone fishin"" signs when the line threatens to test the patience of the neighbors. Or maybe someone in the kitchen is about to stab someone. Anyway long story short we were all sitting down to delicious pulled pork sandwiches by 6:56. So let's do the math. . .even at their most slammed, this teeny L train sized shack can deliver you from literally out at the curb to pulled pork heaven inside of 30 minutes. Just keep your cool like the staff does and you'll be fine. ok let's talk portion control. I can overeat with the best of you slobs. . .Smoque's sandwiches are plenty big, even if you're one of those carb haters that scrapes the meat off. It comes with a ""small"" fry that has about 2 potatoes' worth in a grease lovin mini grocery bag and a fistful of slaw. I am not into slaw; I ate this slaw. It's crispy and fresh and has no mayo. Nice celery seed flavor to it though. The owner told me they add fresh dressing to the cabbage every 20 minutes. So kimche it's not. Thank god. Wow you're still here. . .ok for your first visit I'd suggest the half and half, just to validate your suspicion that the pulled pork is ever so slightly better than the brisket. Why do you think they make bacon out of pork? I rest my case. Still you need to try everything here, let's try that brisket. It's mighty good. 2nd trip reconnect with the pork. mmmm pork. My next visit I'll get St. Louis style ribs. I'm told they are fattier, meatier and have mo' flav than the baby back ribs. Ribs are pricey and I'm cheap so I'll prob. get the half slab. Staff, presentation, ambience. . .in that order. The prep guys all look pretty tough, kinda like that. Actually I am totally grateful they didn't put up retarded ""authentic"" roadhouse memorabilia or weathered barnwood. I admit if it were grimy and old and on the south side and you got lost trying to find it it would seem like more of an adventure. Just saying. Check out the smoker when you go back to wash your hands. It's like 8 times bigger than those rotisseries they have at Dominick's. Prices are fair. We got out of there for around $10 a head. Not bad at all. Minor point, they do a lot of little things to keep it all running smoothly. Too boring to write about but I noticed them all. More restaurants should sweat the details like Smoque does. BYOB. We didn't. Pathetic really. Next time.",0.9967,0.78,0.153,0.067,0.47361111111111115

It tasted smokey to me (glad my taste buds aren't burned out). The meat was tender and juicy. I too loved the mac and cheese, had the flavor and feel of a good homemade comfort food. Didn't like the coleslaw, just because it wasn't creamy-but it did taste fresh. What I didn't like, was the size and design of the place. It was like a jammed in picnic area with a bunch of people you don't know.  Also, I don't know if I missed it, or I was too focused on thinking about how the food would taste-what the price on the chalkboard said for the brisket and what the cashier (and flyer) told me were two different things. So I hold back one star, not for the taste of the food, but other little annoying things.I can't wait to get back there and try the cornbread, fries,cobbler...and maybe I can even get there before the chicken runs out. ---Update: tried the chicken, it was tender, juicy with a non-rubbery skin (the best part, for me).

I really like that you can order 1/2 slab of each as part of a meal (or you can order 1/2 or whole slab ala carte).  I ordered 1/2 of each.  The babyback ribs were a little drier than I sometimes like, but still good.  I much preferred them over the St. Louis style ribs, but honestly I think I just kind of got a bad cut.  At least 2 of the ribs were just covered in solid gelatenous fat, which was kind of nasty.  The other half wasn't like that at all.  (we had ordered it to go, I might've taken them back up to the counter had I been there).   I like that the ribs are mostly just dry rub and they provide you the sauce on the side.  I sometimes hate places that douse them with sauce (though I can think of some places that do it this way and it's really good...).  They give you two different kinds of sauce, I don't really remember the difference but one I liked and one I didn't like at all. The sides were great.  The mac and cheese was AMAZING.  The peach cobbler had a hint of almond--delicious.  Baked beans were better than most others.  Cole slaw I could do without.  Cornbread was good.  Didn't try the fries but they looked good too. The place is efficiently ran and seemed to be very well managed.  There was a manager walking around and chatting with everyone to make sure they were happy.  The cashier rang up our order wrong but we got it straightened out (and the manager happened to notice we went back and approached us to help her help us).  The line was a good 10 people long with a single cashier.  It took over 30 minutes to wait through the line and wait for our food... From my experience, this is pretty typical of any rib place I've been to, and it seemed like they were really organized about it, so I'm not complaining. The parking situation was a little iffy... They do have a parking lot behind them (only during the off hours of another business, so after 5:30).  We found a spot, but the lot was nearly full.  There was a guy outside in an orange vest that they had hired to deal with helping people park in the right areas.  The street had some street parking but other places were zoned, and I overheard him telling someone else they had hired him because some crazy old woman was taking pictures of all the cars that parked in the wrong place.  It's nice of them to hire someone, I know most places would just not worry about it and let the customer worry about being towed. I don't know who rated this 1 $, I don't think it's possible to eat for under $10.  The rib meals are $18-19.  If you order the cheapest thing, which is probably one of the sandwiches, it would still be more than $10 once you add drink and tax. We went with ribs in mind, but it did seem like the brisket and pulled pork sandwichers were a lot more popular (by far).  They looked really delicious, I want to go back and try the brisket.",0.9982,0.758,0.187,0.054,0.5656810035842292

By the time it was peach cobbler time, my tummy was already full--nothing a little ""pattin' it down"" couldn't help, though.   The cobbler was very good and even though my stomach was way full, I was glad I didn't have to share with Justin--his enormous brisket sandwich was more than enough for him.  We stuffed ourselves silly for under $20.  A delicious deal!

Surprisingly it wasn't loud, despite all the people. Fast, efficent and good. I'll go back but this isn't my #1 choice for barbeque.",0.863,0.745,0.168,0.087,0.6550520833333333
2007-02-12,4.0,"born and raised on a cattle ranch in kansas...i think i know a bit about bbq, and really haven't found much that compares up here in the chi. but. that all changed last friday when i sampled the offerings from smoque. chicken, brisket, baby-back ribs, st. louis style ribs - all were wonderful. these are fork and knife ribs - you'll be sawing them off the bone with your knife/fork and then can opt to use your hands.   the sauce(s) had an original flavor and tang to them that still makes my mouth water. do they bottle this stuff? baked beans were very tasty as well but i didnt care for the slaw.. ill make this a bi-weekly tradition.",0.5998,0.854,0.089,0.058,0.5583333333333333
2007-02-12,3.0,"I read all the reviews and was expecting nothing short of Robert Johnson's devil-owned soul to come slap me in the face when I took a bite. Nonetheless, I was relatively unfazed.  My biggest issue was with the uncomfortable dining environment.  This struck me as a lunch place: cavernous, very harshly lit, bare floors, cafeteria seating, the food counter, all the way down to the self-serve pop machine.  Not like I'm any huge dining snob, I was just expecting something a little more laid-back and condusive to dining. Onto the food.  I had the Pulled Pork Platter w/2 sides, comes with slaw.  The pulled pork was good, but not excellent.  The sauce wasn't what I was expecting.  Slaw was eh... it was like a few sprouts.  The Mac & Cheese would have been great, if they gave you more than a tiny cup of it.  And the fries were really good, the best part of the meal. I do admire their BBQ Manifesto, I'm glad to see a place take a stand on food that, as they say, inspires much debate.  It's also a good addition to the neighborhood.  I'll probably come back to check out another dish, but only because the options are more limited on this side of town. Fat Willy's is still my number-one, hands-down favorite in the city.  They beat out Smoque on flavor, options, portions, taste, and ambience (by a long shot).  I may be spoiled, but other places raised the bar for me and I think Smoque is only going to do well because of its relative isolation.",0.991,0.761,0.185,0.053,0.5195429666119321
2007-02-11,3.0,"an antiseptic bbq for Northsiders (ie, white folks).  no rib tips. no hot links. after ordering, i saw a diehard foodie bud who advised me to not bother with the ribs. we promptly changed our order from full slab to briskets/pulled pork and never looked back. the ribs were tinted with smoke tho lacked spices and the good ol porkiness of other ribs from the side south. yes, the fries are good, but if i wanted good fries, i'd just move back to LA and eat in-n-out everyday. go for a cheap beef brisket sandwich and avoid the rest of the menu. A slightly sweet, slighty tangy, barely spicy, not-to-thick/not-to-think sauce was the saving grace. Alas, the sauce is not the boss. Barbara Ann's, Lem's, Mack's, George's (on Sibley) even Honey1, all have better offerings.",0.9271,0.793,0.149,0.058,0.475
2007-02-07,5.0,"The 5 star review parade marches on!  The northside Chicago BBQ scene has always been so sad- at other places I'd learned to dose up my meat with tons of sauce to get my flavor and have been left wondering, what did the meat even taste like?   Smoque fixes that by doing it right!  Long/slow smoking of the meat infuses wonderful taste, plus a nice spice rub and all I need is a little of their homemade sauce to finish what is by far the best BBQ I've had in the city.  I seriously burp smokey goodness for a couple hours after pigging out here!  And I end up with extra/unused sauce!?! Their sides have all been super tasty too!  My favorite is that peach cobbler counts as a side with your rib order.  Oh yeah, they welcome BYOB too! Parking is a little bit of a challenge, and the place has been reasonably crowded too.  But totally worth getting here...a reasonable walk from my house, and eating here I'm gonna need the exercise!",0.9785,0.796,0.174,0.03,0.6098544973544973

2007-02-02,5.0,"Hooray for a new restaurant in my ever-so-slowly gentrifying neighborhood!   All of that aside, however; this place is GREAT.  Seriously some of the best barbecue I have ever had.  The meat was incredibly lean but somehow still incredibly tender and perfectly seasoned.  I love love love the pulled pork sandwich (which is really so big it should be considered two sandwiches).  And oh my god the brisket!  And the macaroni and cheese is so creamy and cheesy and delicious and good!   My boyfriend and I went for dinner, left stuffed even though we couldn't finish our sandwiches, and spent less than $20.  And it's BYOB, which makes it even more of a bargain. My only complaint is the ambiance/decor.  The room is kind of cold and the chairs aren't comfortable at all.  Still, a small thing to overlook for barbecue this good! 3/12/07 EDIT: My last three attempts to eat here have been thwarted.  Apparently business has been TOO good, as I have been greeted on the aformentioned three occasions by signs on the door saying 'sold out'.  How can a restaurant located in a major city in the Midwest be completely sold out of meat on a Thursday?  Is the owner not paying his bills?   If you don't live in the neighborhood and you're making a special trip to check this place out, I'd recommend calling first so you're not disappointed.",0.9965,0.723,0.245,0.032,0.5399796282149222
2007-01-22,5.0,"This very well could be my number one choice for BBQ in the city.  Went there for the first time this weekend after reading a review in the Redeye.  The slow cooked chopped brisket sandwich was one of the best I have ever had.  Almost as good was the pulled pork!  The BBQ is the perfect balance of sweet and spicy.   The cole slaw with red onions was excellent.  The baked mac n cheese met every expectation.  The fries were perfect.  My brother in law had the St. Louis Ribs and said ""If I lived above Twin Anchors and [Smoque] was 10 blocks away, I would make the walk without a doubt"".  I really can't tell you how much I liked this place and how excited I am to return! ------------------------------------------HOURS---------------------------------- Closed Monday Tues, Wed, Thurs and Sun 11am-9pm Fri & Sat 11am-10pm ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",0.9843,0.775,0.213,0.012,0.5022222222222222
2007-01-20,5.0,"UPDATE: Are we seriously judging this place on the dining environment, the lighting, and the color of the walls?  Good grief.  IT IS A BBQ PLACE without table service... what do you expect?  Not that I care in ANY way, but for a BBQ place, it looks pretty damn good: clean walls, clean tables, clean floors, clean kitchen upon which anyone can look, and clean restrooms.  And because people seem to care, I think the walls are a non-harsh red with a slight brownish hue and I do not find the lighting to be harsh and I did not need a blanket wrapped around me while I sat near the door in January (in case wall-color and fluorescent lights matter to you when you buy a ton of meat at a BYOB cop haven in Avondale).  Judge cheap take-out places on food, not on friggin ambiance or your normative perception of a lack thereof.... ugh. Original review: Outstanding.  Absolutely delectable.  I have never tasted better pulled pork in my life.   I would go WAY out of my way for this place... luckily I live about 6 blocks away.   Without a doubt one of the biggest gems in Avondale or Irving Park. During the 15 minutes I waited for my takeout order to finish, No less than 3 CPD cruisers pulled up entirely separate of each other, EACH cop picking up separate orders (for at least 6 people).  The cops didn't even know each other... If this place is good for 3x6=18 cops on a late Saturday afternoon, you know it's something special.  And there were about 20-25 other diners there at the time, so it's not by any stretch just a CPD haven.   Destined to become one of my favorites in the city.  Can't wait to try the ribs... OUTSTANDING, OUTSTANDING, OUTSTANDING.",0.9964,0.684,0.236,0.08,0.5834821428571428
2007-01-12,5.0,Best BBQ on the North Side.  Pulled pork and brisket sandwich are the best.  The ribs could use some work.  I went the first week they opened and I wasn't expecting so many people to be there.   The Mack and cheese is straight from Alton Brown!  Even down to the Panko Breadcrumbs on top. The french fries are just like Little Louie's from way back in the day! I am so happy that I live within walking distance!  Hail to Smoque.  I will be a frequent customer.  I am bringing my in-laws there tonight!,0.9675,0.786,0.214,0.0,0.37863247863247856
