I'm sure a pair of thongs or even a fork would've been better than her hands. After seeing that, we were fine with the place. I didn't see her wash her hands one time.

2015-09-08,3.0,"The reason I give the Hollywood grill a three star review is because for the most part the establishment is clean, another yelper made a comment in regards to the bathroom and he was correct, scratches on the glass and graffiti. Definitely some room for improvement. The waiter/waitresses/host have strong and weak points as most restaurants do. I in good conscience do not want to call out anyone's name, but I will say the waitress Eve is by far the best followed by Annette and Katrina I believe, o and Becky is an absolute delight. The host/cashier who I believe is named Jonathan does a great job trying to calm the madness that is the weekend morning rush. He also does it with a smile and I feel he genuinely means it. Now lastly the food, personally I think it is a little overpriced for what it is. I don't mind paying as long as it's worth it. The food is almost like a hit or miss. For the most part the breakfast is great, very good pancakes and French toast. I cannot recall other items, but I do remember the soup is almost always great. This is definitely somewhere to eat after a long night of partying or for the breakfast items. The rest is meh. O btw they do have some pretty decent deals regarding children and certain times of day. Though I gave it 3 stars, I would give it about 3.5 stars. I do love the scenery  though, great murals very great unique Hollywood vintage look that is one of a kind. In my opinion a few minor fixes and this place could really be something.  Regardless I do respect what the owner has done with this place, it's easy for us to judge a business when we do not know the ins and outs of it.",0.9983,0.704,0.268,0.028,0.5558058608058608

2015-04-30,2.0,"When a relative comes to visit the city of Chicago, one does not take them to McDonald's one-dollar menu just because it is affordable. As a matter fact, one tends to show off the best of Chicago. Hollywood Grill is one of those places that no matter what time of the day it is they will give you those delicious fluffy pancakes you ask for. Yes, they do provide breakfast anytime and it cooked to your desire. But when it comes to big meals, it is the complete opposite. Let me not mention the service there. I do not know why I always end up coming here. I try to give them a chance, but they still fail to satisfy my late night cravings. Maybe it is the bright, vivid colors on the big long sign that glows Hollywood Grill. But, how would you feel when you are close to the door and there is a waitress on the entrance not letting you enter because she is to busy smoking? And once you finally in, should you awkwardly wait for her to come back and greet you because the other ladies are occupied attending the only man on the stool? It is the service that values the most because it helps you eat peacefully without complaining, but man do they fail to improve every time. After ten minutes of waiting, getting those menus is the goal. Every single meal listed is described in a beautiful way. They also provide a kids menu where it is listed that before 11 p.m. the kids eat free.    Now, being able to get their assistance back is a hassle. It comes to the point where there is no other option but to call the manager to serve. For a party of 16, it is a lot of orders to memorize. After desperately waiting for 30 minutes and finally getting the food out, one forgets all the trouble they went through to get what they want. The smoky hot burger known for its Chicago Style is the only one to stand out around the table full of cups filled with water. After a couple of minutes, the creamy chicken fettuccine makes its way to the center of the table, and I must admit it looked delicious. As the plates continue to make their way into the table, I take a bite into the juicy jalapeño burger I then realize the patty is smaller than the bun itself. As I go into the third bite, I notice how red the meat was inside while the outside looked really juicy and grilled. I could not resist and look at everyone's facial expressions as they ate their meals. The creamy fettuccine had lost its color and no longer hot. The beverages were incorrectly given to us. And the famous free meal for the kids was brought out to the table last to only show up with ten oily curly fries and a bogus squished cheeseburger. After having such a bad experience with the food and having replacements over replacements, it came to our minds to order dessert to sweeten our anger. The Belgian Waffle with pecans and a scoop of vanilla ice cream sounded just right for the moment.  The moment I saw it come out of the kitchen doors, I fell in love. It was the perfect waffle. The edges were well done, leaving not a single wedge of the extra waffle mix, and the color of it was just a perfect tan leaving the inside very fluffy and hot. The ice cream, the pecans, and the maple syrup were the perfect toppings. I was really enjoying the waffle until I received the bill. The amount was exaggerating. As I read and tried to calculate it on my phone, I would not get the exact amount. I called the waitress and concluded that they had charged us gratuity without letting us know; in addition, they also charged us 12% for having over 6. There was no option, but to pay and leave with our mouths full of critics. I guess next time, McDonald's it is.",0.9931,0.8,0.129,0.071,0.5036211798152097

I mean how can you mess up breakfast food it is near impossible but what happened next was even more shocking.  After I paid my bill and tipped the waitress I left with my friend.  As I left and was driving down the block no more than a mile away the cops pulled me over! He said that he just got a call that someone didn't pay their bill and was fleeing by car.  The cop was very rude and ready to take me to jail for theft! Luckily I had my receipt I showed it to the cop and he didn't say anything shook his head and without saying a word left.  No sorry, no you are free to go.  It outraged me so I went back to hollywood grill to confront the owner or manager.  When I went in I of course got into an argument with him, he mocked me, refused to give me a refund for accusing me of stealing (my bill was only 25ish bucks with my friend with tip).  Then to make it even more embarrassing the whole place erupted and was making fun of me for complaining.  It was overall a mortifying experience not only getting mocked by the manager, not even getting an apology, but having a bunch of drunks yelling obscenities too.   I am shocked this place is in business and that anyone would give it more than one star.  I will never go back and I suggest you find a different place to go.  F--ck this place I have never been back since.",-0.9847,0.733,0.088,0.18,0.4499488304093568

2015-02-12,4.0,"This is an old-school Chicago kind of place that's slowly transforming from the plain, simple but broad menu of standards to a hipster version of itself. That's probably what it needs to do to survive on such a busy corner, in a neighborhood that's morphing from working class to hipster and rich.  The restaurant looks clean and bright. There is a long counter off the entrance, and a row of booths along the window where you can watch careless pedestrians and drivers face off at a busy intersection. As you walk towards the back, you see that the restaurant is laid out in the shape of the letter ""L"", and there is another area of booths and tables.  Menus are kept at each table, so you can start perusing the selections as soon as you sit down. The menu is crazy big, in the style of the classic Greek-owned diner. Although we arrived right around noontime on a weekday, we wanted to have breakfast foods. In this kind of restaurant, breakfast is served all day. We were quickly offered coffee or tea and provided with water and silverware. The waitress took our orders promptly, and we received our food promptly. The only hiccup we had with service was getting our check and paying. We sat for almost 15 minutes before the waitress appeared with the check, which almost made us late for an appointment. My friend ordered scrambled eggs and toast and a hot chocolate, and I had an egg sandwich with cheddar cheese (extra cost - you could choose swiss or American) and bacon. It came with a small side of cole slaw, and I chose fruit instead of hash browns or fries. It was a lot of food. I added some hot sauce to the sandwich, which helped give it a bit of a kick. It wasn't highly spiced at all to begin with, but it was okay. I had to take the fruit with, because I was so full. The eggs and toast my friend ate were just fine. I mean, you have to work pretty hard to screw up that kind of order, don't you? She was full, too. There is a small parking lot in back, and we saw a sign that indicated there's another lot somewhere nearby. But the lot in back is small. There were two large trucks parked nearest the alley entrance to the lot. There were so huge, we couldn't squeeze our little car past them to use an available space that was adjacent to the building. Be aware that someone already in a close-up space could get blocked in. As it was, we found a close parking spot on North Avenue. Of course, we had to pay for that -- what a bummer when we might have parked for free. I hope Hollywood Grill doesn't change much. We need places in Chicago where we can have coffee and an omelette without spending $20. And we need to keep restaurants that aren't following the latest trend by combining odd ingredients, or experimenting with fusion. Sometimes you want a simple, basic, Midwestern meal. At least for now, Hollywood Grill is still a place you can get that.",0.9855,0.878,0.086,0.036,0.4835988455988454

I think the only reason this place stays in business is because it's the only diner in the area; it's also 24 hours so it attracts a whole other market after 10 PM. I went here once and had a bad experience, went a second time and got the death blow-I'll never come back.

After waiting a good 10 minutes for the waitress to come around and give me my check, I finally took my plate to the counter to have it wrapped and get my bill. It's like the waitress was in la-la land. Every time I looked over in her direction she seemed to be in another world. So after taking the food to the counter myself and asking for the check, the owner, who looked like he was high, says something like, ""so you're in a hurry, eh?"" Remaining calm, I was like, ""yeah, some people work you know."" He runs my credit card and hands me the bill-$12.50!!! An omelette and a glass of orange juice. The orange juice was $3.50! The food tasted like sh*t, the hash browns were barely cooked, and they didn't even have the presence of mind to give me a water. Another odd curiosity was a nod to the 'Father of Lies' painted into the very corner of an otherwise nicely done mural on the south wall.

I love your comfy booths, tasty pies and endless coffee - which all fit with the homey, hey-day Americana, greasy spoon interiors. As a  night owl frequently in search of good, quality comfort food, I'll admit this is one of my favorite neighborhood diners. Plus, it's reasonably priced, open 24-hours and has free parking. But more important, I've always had solid meals  and  friendly, attentive service there. I liked it so much, I'd hold meetings there if a team member was treating. That is, until today. Had a story meeting with my exec. producer and was embarrassed by the service by a Latina waitress named Esther who was so busy cackling and talking loudly to other staff, she kind of forgot that she'd JUST asked for our order, before turning her head to yell across the counter. I asked her, ""Excuse me, didn't you just ask us a question?"" It could've gone better after that. But, no. Esther then proceeded to give us attitude, ROLLING HER EYES and ignoring our table. We had to flag her down, literally, for anything. Zero coffee refills. No hot sauce. No dice. At one point, she barked at my friend, a start-up entrepreneur, to ""move that menu back,'  pointing at menu on the table with a spare finger, even when there was enough room on the table to set down the plate she was holding. Yes, pure class.  The guys didn't care because, as they pointed out, they were never coming back. I just wrote: ""NO, bad service,""  on the line for tips on my receipt.  I really liked it up till now. Too bad. Owners, take note: It only takes once before you lose a loyal customer.

If I was within a 5 mile radius you'd bet this is how I would close out my night. So when a friend suggested Hollywood as our 3 AM breakfast I was sure my usual omelet order would do me right. It did me wrong last night and this morning.  This place serves it's purpose for the neighborhood; drunk food 101. Greasy with no flavor. It's the recipe for success.

I would, however, not come here for dinner.  That is what made me never want to come back.  I should have known.  Maybe I'd have a burger, but that would be about as far as I'd recommend venturing into the dinner menu.  The chicken fingers I had were just not good, and I'm not really sure how you can mess that up.  Anyway, stick to the typical diner breakfast options, and this place isn't half bad.

Hollywood Grill is your standard diner with all the self-conscious, retro charm you'd want: old record covers on the walls, a painting of Clark Gable, dizziness-inducing purple lights.  It's open 24 hours and thank God, since the last time I was there a couple years ago was at 2am, crying into a banana split over some jerky boyfriend while my best friend and the server comforted me.  Note: there is free parking for restaurant patrons in the back. We had a great time.  We got there at 10 and found a seat easily and, as it turned out, in the nick of time.  By 11, the place was packed with Friday night sojourners.  Among the 4 of us, we consumed the following: grilled cheese sandwiches (the deluxe size, just a dollar more than the regular, also gets you a little cup of soup, fries, and sliced pickle--such a deal!), fries, milkshakes, carrot cake, an open face tilapia sandwich, a turkey sandwich, and other things I'm now forgetting.  The bill was just $39 before tax!  Our server was a doll, called us ""sweetheart"" whenever she stopped by to ask someone if they wanted their water refilled, and was attentive and friendly. By midnight, the volume in the packed diner was crazy loud.  Luckily we were sleepy and full of cheese and ice cream, so we headed out into the col weather.  A perfectly satisfying night.",0.9868,0.82,0.142,0.039,0.4532878411910671

These must have come from some government cheese mashed potato box; no texture at all. The hash browns were better, but only after dousing them with salt and ketchup. I had to seperate them because they were all clumped up. They had absolutely no flavor and were probably from some generic brand. At least get some Ore Ida hash browns! My friend ordered the cheese fries and the other just got orange juice. She tried both and said the cheese fries were microwaved and the juice wasn't even juice, just high fructose corn syrup and coloring.

The service had a lot to be desired, it was slow and left a few things off. We did get a new plate after complaining of the hair though.",0.7543,0.839,0.116,0.045,0.4577922077922078
2007-06-06,2.0,"I always feel conflicted about the Hollywood Grill.  The food is way overpriced for the quality and it's always busy.  There's an older guy who I think works there that just sits at a stool and chews out the waitstaff.  I was there one night when one of the servers flipped out on him - apparently this manager is verbally abusive to all of the staff and this one particular server had enough. I've been several times and still haven't found anything that's blown me away, but the off-street parking is nice.",0.2732,0.931,0.041,0.028,0.40238095238095234

The standouts from the menu are the french fries and the steak quesadilla (which is considerably delicious for a non-Mexican restaurant). The service is interesting, especially the later you drop in. I find that its a 50/50 draw as to whether my waitress is on crack or not, but the ones that seem clean are exceptionally nice. I've never had to ask for more coffee during any visit, which is infinitely important for a diner. The decorations around the place are kind of fun (all classic Hollywood related), except for the paintings of the Three Stooges above the counter, which are just creepy. Definitely check this place out if you're in need of some coffee or greasy food at around 4am.",0.969,0.837,0.153,0.01,0.5464912280701754

2007-05-10,4.0,"Their breakfast menu is petty good and decently priced. Great place for nourishment after a long night of partying and it seems EVERYONE knows it since there's always a 50-person line in the mornings!   I would give Hollywood Grill 5 stars if the staff weren't so obvious in showing their frustration with how understaffed and undersized they are for the amount of business they get.  Waitstaff appear stressed and hurried, tables are often crammed uncomfortably close to accommodate more diners, and the manager is constantly (and nearly obnoxiously) eye-balling diners to see who's leaving (or using his stare to encourage them to leave) so the table could be set up for the next set of customers. I also believe this is why checks are settled at the register instead of your table. RECOMMENDATION:  If you're not pressed for time, definitely do the Hollywood Grill for breakfast.   IMPORTANT: Plan on standing in line 20 minutes to get a table and another 10 at the register when leaving.",0.8564,0.841,0.103,0.056,0.5541666666666666

HG is one of the best places to observe people in Wicker Park- you'll see plenty of young people on Thursday thru Saturday nights, and the hangover crowd in line with families fresh from church on Sunday mornings.   Good place to go, but take some good company.  You'll probably have to be patient- even when the place is nearly empty it is hard to get your coffee cup refilled.",0.9741,0.778,0.186,0.036,0.5338541666666666

On weekends expect a lot of drunk stumbling people and a less clean than usual restroom.  Sandy the waitress (she looks like Annie Lennox) is usually particularly great at keeping my plate full, half & half plentiful, and extra napkins on the table.     Oh! Keep an eye on your silverwear!  Most of their meals are at least two courses and you will likely lose a spoon or a fork.  I can't help but love this atmosphere.  Check out the murals in the back: who knew Clarke Gable, Vivian Leigh, Ingred Bergman, and Humphry Bogart could be so uglified?  Well, Who knew Clarke Gable, Vivian Leigh, and Ingred Bergman could, anyway.",0.9917,0.763,0.181,0.056,0.49607843137254903
