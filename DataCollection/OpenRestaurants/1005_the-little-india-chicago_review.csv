I never got the naan bread which comes with the veggie combo and they messed up my order for the drinks. I said I wanted a Sprite and a Coke and they gave me two cokes. When I called back to explain the issue the lady on the phone made feel like I was doing something wrong. She put me on hold as she checked with the kitchen if they put a naan in the bag. Coming back on the phone, she asked me again if I was SURE I didn't get a naan bread. Ok, now I'm a liar? She then said ""well we can't come back to bring it now. And we can't bring you an extra sprite."" I'm like, ""well you know what--- handle the issue. Because if you can't bring my naan that YOU FORGOT, as well as my sprite at least take it off my check, because I'm paying for the naan I never got."" I understand things happen... it's probably a busy Saturday night.

I love places that offer BYOB. We did have a bit of an awkward interaction where we tried to order a lunch special, but the lunch time special had ended a few minutes before we ordered. Honestly, the regular price of the food didn't seem at all worth it, especially compared to the lunch special. However, the waiter was nice enough to give it to us when he overheard us discussing whether or not we wanted to stay for a meal. The food was good and the service was fine. I had the Chicken Tikka Masala, which was absolutely excellent. They've won an award or two for it, and it is well deserved. By far my favorite dish that we ordered, and it even interested my vegetarian fiance. My second dish was the Vegetable Jalfrazie, which was fine, but not spectacular. My fiance had the Dal Makhani and the Palak Paneer. He thought they were good, but nothing special. I don't think it was anything above-and-beyond, but it was a fairly decent meal.

I wouldn't waste my time or breathe on writing a review of a place that's not worth visiting at least once, if not ten or more times in the last four years. My girlfriend and I discovered this gem years back when we went on our first date to see Pillowman at the Red Twist Theatre. The restaurant offers a 20% discount if you have tickets for a show that night at Red Twist on Bryn Mawr.  So the reason I'm giving the Little India one star is because the yellow dal we ordered the other night was bland, without any distinct flavor and had the consistency of overcooked porridge. I should have known something was awry when we asked for Kashmiri rice and they said they didn't have any. To my mind, either they got a new cook, new management, or both. Cutting corners and offering sub-standard fare. And the host was a warm and lively as a cold cucumber. Ridiculously officious, as if being exceedly formal made your guests feel better about your service, or lack thereof.  I used to get teased by this lovely Indian woman for being too thin and that someone needs to feed me better. I've met some lively personalities who have worked here in the past, but the cast and crew the other night offered the same veneer of friendliness I could get at any fast food joint.  The rest of the meal was decent but common, ordinary, nothing to write home to tell my mom, who learned to cook in Goa, about. And having walked several blocks away to park the car and walk through a real downpour, flash flood warnings noted once we arrived, to sit for a less than extraordinary meal and have to pay for it is simply culinary highway robbery. I've eaten incredible meals here in the past and the Kashmiri rice is to find your tastebuds this side of paradise. The garlic naan is always worth getting as are the veggie samosas. Bless their hearts, maybe the cook was having a bad night. This isn't a bad review, it is a review based on the love of a familiar place irrevocably changed for whatever reason. We've always had great dinners here in the past. I just hope someone at the restaurant reads this and picks up on the clue to find their way out of the maze they are in. It just makes me want to open my own Indian restaurant in Hyde Park, if only I had the money, management skills and know-how to create a sensation on the south side.

2013-03-11,3.0,"Good food but too pricy to order for delivery even though I bit the bullet the first time looking for a decent Indian place. Well, I found good food and really enjoyed the Chicken Masala, but not enough to splurge and buy the whole town's dinner on my dime. If you are OK with paying a bit more, which I do sometimes, this place is fine.  I figured I would write a review bc I see others saying pricing is good, but how many other places charge approx. $25/person? Seems high for me when I'm just trying to get some decent delivery options for a Monday night.  Here's my order: Chicken Tika Masala x2 (for two people) Plain White Rice (need to order separate - perhaps that is what is irking me) Naan That's it. For delivery (I'm not far away) it's $4 extra.  So take into account that I tip the driver $5 on top of the pre-charged delivery fee (I always tip $5 to delivery drivers and feel cheap if I don't). Total it all up, and you're at $50.  Here's my tip: If you order from Grubhub, that's great..but go to their direct website and order and you'll get 10% off your first order at this place...  Now ordering elsewhere/different type of food/or finding something in the kitchen since it's too 'spensive for this guy for a Monday evening din'.

Mango lassi. Samosas. Chana masala. Bhatura. The samosas were worthy of an extra purchase, as I often eat them for breakfast. The chana masala came in a hearty gravy, not like the thick gravy you get in South Indian chana masala. The bhatura was perfect with the chana masala. And I got the food spicy the way that I like it. I am more conscious of price when the quality of the food lacks. At The Little India, the prices are comparable to what you get at any of the eateries along the Devon Avenue stretch.

I have also ordered delivery from Little India and was somewhat underwhelmed.  The delivery order took a little over an hour and I don't live too far away.  I was also disappointed that entrees in the vicinity of $10 did not come with plain rice... you have to order that separately.  Still, the food was hot and fresh when it arrived at our door.

2012-07-18,1.0,"I feel obligated to write this review - as every time I walk past this place I feel I was taken advantage of for paying for super crappy food and super crappy service. I had just moved into the neighborhood and was excited to try this restaurant.  I brought my cousin who had never tried Indian food before. We went in around 5:30 pm and there was only one other table there. A young woman was working the register and an young Indian man waited on us. I felt like I had to ask him for every single thing - he clearly had never waited tables before. He was texting for over 10 minutes after he had taken our drink order - and hadn't even brought us a cup of water. When I  asked him about the drinks, he flippantly said ""she"" would be bringing them soon. The limeade's arrived from a chick in the kitchen and were clearly freshly squeezed with chunks of sugar floating in the glass.  I also had to clarify with the waiter that we wanted our Samosas first. These were large and the sauces were just fine. This was the only pleasing part of this meal. Lamb Marsala and a Chicken dish with plain rice (extra$$) and Naan: The waiter forgot to put the Naan order in - and when the food arrived without it - even though he supposedly had written down our order, he couldn't figure out which type we wanted and argued which one we had ordered ... The sauces were adequate - but the meat was ROCK HARD and disgusting. My lamb marsala ~ the lamb had been skewered with holes in each end was super tough and chewy. The chicken dish my cousin got - the meat was also very tough ... it's like the meat had been sitting around for hours, and they added it to a new order. VERY DISAPPOINTING. We took the food to-go - and I could never eat it again ... When I got home, my new roommate told me how she had been violently ill after eating there and to go to Devon for Indian food ...I have learned my lesson - although it will be a long time before I eat Indian at all ...",-0.8954,0.846,0.07,0.084,0.5939993686868685

While not the same bargain as a lunch buffet, The Little India is still a decent deal for lunch, with a combo meat and veggie dish falling below $10. I think the dinner entrees are a little pricey, which is why I base this review mainly on my lunch experiences. Today I went for their lunch combo and my mutter paneer and chicken makhani were both nicely spiced and made with fresh ingredients. The naan was also fresh and served soft and warm. One thing I noticed this time, as opposed to my lunches in the past, is that they did not serve a green salad. That is not a big issue, but it was a noticeable change. They did make up for it with a basket of two whole naans cut in half and a large serving of rice. However, I can't help but think that all this starch is to compensate for the lesser size of the two entrees I ordered, for their portions were smaller. Considering that people eat Indian food using both rice and naan, maybe there could have been a little more to the size of the entrees and a little less of the rice or naan. That is really my only, minor issue with The Little India, that and the price of the dinner entrees. The food here has always been consistently good.",0.5449,0.911,0.054,0.035,0.484031198686371

The gentleman never did acknowledge that there was anything wrong with the food. Nor did he take the food to the chef. Nor did he apologize to my husband in any way.

Previously, I would have said that food was good but too expensive for Indian food, considering what similar Indian/Pakistani joints were charging. This is still true. I also would have vented my annoyance at the pricing structure, which can be both irrational and rigid (i.e. the price of a side of rice, what does and does not come with different dinner specials). It is still rigid and annoying. But the saving grace was the lunch special, which came with soup or salad, and one veggie entree and one chicken entree from a list, and biriyani and a naan bread. This too was a bewildering cross-hatch of permitted and non-permitted items and up-charge items, but that was fine. Well, the lunch special is a bust now. If you want this lunch special, you may no longer choose your own veggie and chicken entree, but must go with ""daily special,"" where these are chosen for you. Maybe they were trying to simplify things? But they've taken all the choice out of it, and the fun. Also, the amount of the chicken and veggie selection that is served has shrunk considerably. This is really a kind of tali now. Which would be fine - the deal with a tali is that you can choose meat tali or veggie tali and get a couple of scoops of each (plus naan and biriyani) and you get what you're given - but it is often quite inexpensive in return. This tali-like lunch special is almost twice the going rate for a tali. The sign outside still offers the old deal though. Don't be fooled.",0.9783,0.821,0.129,0.05,0.5440917107583774

She was awkward.  She was not impolite by any means, but her manner was odd.  I can't really describe it any other way.  Each time she came to our table, she made us feel distinctly uncomfortable.  Sitting back in our chairs, obviously done, she took our plates away so slowly and carefully and with such an odd expression that it seemed she was afraid we'd stab her with our forks.   That said, the food was good.  I wasn't blown away by any means, but we were both satisfied with what we ate.  My husband had the chicken tiki masala, and I had the chana masala.  In addition, we ordered the appetizer combo.  LOTS of food - too much, but we took home what we didn't eat.  The appetizers were all delicious, and both entrees were solid ""B"" fare.  Good for a quick stop if you're in the area for another reason, which we were, but living in Edgewater and so close to Devon, we probably wouldn't seek this place out otherwise.",0.4633,0.801,0.105,0.094,0.5214743589743589

Beautiful presentation with each section of the platter seperated so none of the sauces would mix together.  My boyfriend had the lamb vindaloo. Spicy but not in a way that overpowered the rich flavor of the lamb and sauce. The only improvement to this dish might be more potato.  Everything was flavorful and fresh.  The service was gracious, friendly and unobtrusive. We weren't constantly interrupted, but the staff were always within earshot. in case we needed anything. Water glasses were constantly refilled. The entire staff was able to explain anything on the menu and offer suggestions.  We also had hot mugs of the masala chai. Best. Chai. Ever. It was stronger than usual coffeehouse chai, but wow-was it good! Finished the meal with badami kheer, a traditional Indian dessert that closely resembles rice pudding. It was chilled and super creamy with nuts on top and a hint of citrus. Very refreshing after the spice of the meal.  A couple seated near us weren't familiar with Indian food and the staff started by asking what they liked/had a taste for this evening to help steer them in the direction of dished they'd most enjoy.

So what was the straw that broke the camel's back? Upon ordering food from them multipe times and SPECIFICALLY requesting that  it be made spicy, I once again recieved food that had little to no spice. So last night, after ordering more than 40 dollars worth of food might I add,  I called The Little India and spoke to the waiter that took my order about the lack of spice. He simply said that next time he would let the chef know. I, in complete disbelief that he didn't think to do that in the first place, requested to speak to a manager, seeing that this has happened MULTIPE times. The manager (who I believe is actually the owner) apologized and said that the next time we ordered the bill would be on  The Little India. So what happened? We called, placed our regular order, and when asked what form of payment we would be using we explained what we were told previously by the manager/owner. Then the manager gets on the phone and claims that he said nothing of the sort! Can you believe that!? I was on the phone with this a**hole for at least ten minutes and this lying weasel denies ever agreeing to pick up the bill! When ordering between 40-50 dollars for carryout you expect to get exactly what you ask for...ESPECIALLY if the food is already overpriced and you order regularly!

2008-08-08,3.0,"Fairly new to the area The Little India offers some traditional Indian food along with some fusion. Lucky for them a group and I were walking to another restaurant when a guy handed us a flyer with a coupon so we said why not. It's not a very large space (maybe 32 people if that) and the decor is very plain. Personally I think they need bigger tables because the dishes they serve you with are quite large, so you are left with holding your plate to eat off of. The service really wasn't up to par whatsoever, slow and never came around (they just stood by the front booth chatting to each another). I also got a little upset when I was told what to order, I am no expert in India cuisine but if you going to change my order at least tell me why, I order what I like. I will say that the food was pretty good out of all the 6 dishes we ordered (2 chickens dishes, rice, 3 vegetables), there was only one dish that wasn't up to par. Great flavors, great portions and excellent bread. I don't think they advertises this but they didn't say anything about me bringing a bottle of wine in and they also didn't charge a cork fee. They also do pick and delivery which is very cool. They are a little pricier then you'd expect but they give you big portions.",0.987,0.854,0.133,0.013,0.5252252608502609

The chicken tikka masala & spicy chicken vindaloo are both yummy, and the paneer dishes were also very tasty.  They have my favorite naan in the city, too. Both times I've been in, the music has been pleasant world music at a perfect level for conversation, and the restaurant is very clean.",0.9817,0.758,0.231,0.011,0.7258333333333334

2008-07-03,4.0,"Living all my life in West Rogers Park near Devon Avenue, it's no surprise that I consume quite a bit of really amazing Indian fare. So it's always interesting for me to venture away from that nexus of South Asian cuisine to try what other neighborhoods have to offer. Walking down Bryn Mawr looking for dinner, my girlfriend and I spontaneously decided to dine here. We weren't exactly starving, so we skipped our normal appetizers and went straight for the entrees: Dal Makhani and Chana Masala, with peas pullau rice and a few pieces of naan. Everything was amazing! The entrees came to the table steaming hot. The makhani was very smooth and creamy and perfectly spiced, without requiring a gallon of water to wash it down. The masala was honestly one of the best I've had! The chick peas were very tender and full of flavor all the way through, not chalky or seemingly under-done like is so common at other restaurants, with a very buttery flavor I just couldn't get enough of. The naan was very soft and fluffy with no large burnt spots, and the rice was fluffy and full of peas. Being a vegetarian, I can't speak to the quality of the meat dishes. But hey, if you're going for Indian, stick to the veggie dishes for a more authentic meal, anyhow! We didn't order drinks, and while we didn't have any particularly spicy dishes, the waiter did leave an entire pitcher of water at our table for us, which would likely come in handy for some of the vindaloo dishes, I'm sure! For the price, the portions seemed to be a bargain. With each of us going back for seconds, there were still plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day. The restaurant itself is fairly small, but very bright and clean. The staff seemed very friendly with a couple employees coming to check on us throughout the evening, but without being overbearing. Maybe it's because of it's distance from the hubbub of Devon Avenue, or maybe it's just a genuinely great restaurant, but either way I felt a lot less pressured here than I have in some of the overcrowded Indian restaurants in my neighborhood. I will definitely be back... often!",0.9905,0.864,0.12,0.016,0.5105608465608467

If anything, I'd say the service was just a little slow, especially for the size of the place (which did I say was teeny?).  We waited a long time to have our order taken but once it was everything arrived hot and well-seasoned. BYOB would be nice and I'm puzzled as to why they've chosen to go the other route but, hey, not my restaurant. I wouldn't say this is my favorite place for Indian.  However, it's surely the most convenient which means I'll likely be back sooner than if it was a long haul to get there.  But it's nice to have a place like this in the neighborhood, accessible without a bus.  I, for one, needed the walk to work off the enormous amount of food I took in.  And every bite was enjoyable.",0.9919,0.832,0.161,0.007,0.6261664261664261

Next time, I ordered by ultimate favorite Indian item, though really was probably invented in London, Butter Chicken. I was sadly disappointed. I was ripped off! Their butter chicken is not butter chicken. I had the kheer, and it was nothing to write mom about. Too much liquid and no flavor! I've talked to who I believe are the owners.

I too am a frustrated resident who waits with baited breath while Alderman Smith goes about her incompetent 50-year plan to eventually transform Bryn Mawr into a strip with real businesses. At least Little Mexican Cafe, Francesca's, and Shinobu were a start. I regret to inform you that The Little india is a big step backwards. Let's start with the meat. I'm guessing it was sourced from wherever your old summer camp used to get its questionable chiken. They use all dark meat and it has the consistency of wood chips. We had the Tikka Masala and Chicken Quorma. The sauces had little spice and tasted canned. I have never had naan taste so dry. Jen and I lamented that a ten mintue trip to Trader Joe's for frozen Indian would have yielded better results at a third the price. And that's the final insult. They charge $11 an entree when I get great Thai all the time for $7. If you charge like the Devon joints, you better match up. And that ""No BYOB"" sign in the window is just one more way these folks are deluding themselves into thinking they are running a decent establishment. You'll see from my other reviews that I'm not normally a cranky guy (at least on Yelp). But this was pretty easily the most disappointed meal I've eaten in the six years I've lived in Chicago.

This justified ordering a ridiculous amount of food once they opened, some of which I got to taste. One half of the couple that operates the restaurant kept me company while I waited for take out. She was quite friendly and extremely inquisitive. I thought the meals were just okay, especially considering that they're nine bucks. Veg biryani, gobi Manchurian (wasn't battered?), lentil soup and samosa were quite mild and a bit overcooked (except for the samosa). There was no heat to anything. Veg biryani tastes just like Shan brand spice mix, which is a delicious spice mix. But it's also 89 cents a box. That kind of thing bugs me.  The lunch special seems like a deal for the sheer amount of food you get. It was reported to be bland. And nine bucks.  Sure, it's pricey-- but I've noticed that most IndoPak restaurants are if they have tablecloths.

What has replaced this dump is something absolutely delightful and refreshing by comparison.   To say unequivocally, my party had to drag me from the restaurant--I liked it that much. Now I must back up a bit and say that Indian is my favorite food group.  Which is saying a lot since I grew up in an Italian family.  So having a decent Indian restaurant in my little corner of Edgewater is going to get me buzzing.  But this turned out to be better than decent.  You can't do any better on Devon street.  Pure and simple. The menu is huge for such a small place.  The owner tells me that the kitchen is huge so who am I to judge?  My party ordered three entrees two veggie and a chicken dish which we shared. I am especially fond of Qorma; chicken, lamb, goat you name it.  This time I had the chicken Qorma and it was exactly as I had hoped.  I can't describe it other than to say it stacks up to the best I've had. My second favorite so far was the Vegetable Jalfrazie and it tied with the Dum Aloo Gobi another veggie dish. The tamarind and mint chutney was delish and went well with the standard Samosa fare which is required eating in my circle.  Sometimes I simply like to throw it all together on some rice and make a pig of myself.  Luckily for me it was late on a Saturday afternoon and most of the earlier crowd was gone and didn't have to witness a glutton practicing his high art of pigging out.   Will I be back?  Absolutely.  Again and again and again.....and again.
