On Christmas Day, we went here with 3 foreign friends, and my father who was diabetic and had arthritis (he's passed away now -that was my last Christmas with him). We had reservations. We were not fed for OVER 2 HOURS after being seated. They didn't even bring us appetizers or soup. Nothing. The manager (a young Asian woman), was cold and unapologetic. She blamed the fact that they were busy, but we watched other tables get seated after us, eat and leave before we were even served. Not too busy for them, huh? There was obviously a mistake in the kitchen. That happens. I worked in restaurants for 10 years. But when that happens, you own it, apologized, and make it right. They comped us only a round of drinks and only took $50 off the total bill (we were a party of 7, so that was less than $10 per person). Our meal clearly should have been free. I regret not throwing a fit and storming out. Chen's ruined our Christmas and obviously couldn't have cared less. Go somewhere else. These people don't deserve your money.

We got some egg rolls and crab rangoon...and I got General Tao's chicken, and boyfriend got beef fried rice.  Chen's egg rolls are actually pretty fantastic.

The crab rangoon are ok...standard Asian restaurant crab rangoon.  I will say that the General Tao's was ok. It's better than some other restaurants, but it's still missing something. I will say that boyfriend's fried rice was actually really fantastic. It had a great flavor and I know that it's just fried rice, but it was legit really good.  My biggest complaint about Chen's is that I feel like it is just slightly overpriced. Or maybe it's just a little more than I want it to be.

2011-09-09,2.0,"I moved to the area about a year and a half ago and immediately fell in love with this place. I'm not the biggest fan of sushi so my review only covers a few of the dishes.  The crab rangoon is consistently good and always worth picking up.  My two favorite dishes were the orange chicken and the sesame chicken. Great tasting with good sauces. After ordering a couple times I noticed a very fishy taste to the orange chicken. Not just a minor fishy taste but an overwhelming taste I did not enjoy. I chalked it up to someone making a mistake. I know nothing is perfect and thought they would get it better the next time. After 3 times, I respectfully asked that they correct the issue. Still, no luck. I even went as far as telling them I had a fish allergy, in hopes that they would cook it in a separate pan or whatever. STILL, overwhelming fish taste. It's a good thing I wasn't deathly allergic.  After that, moved to the sesame chicken. It's a delightful dish, really. Good portion, awesome sauce and delicious crunch. Again, good for a while and then the inconsistencies began to creep in. The last straw with Chens was when I got all the way home to notice that they had not only forgotten the crab rangoon I had ordered, but left the sauce off the sesame chicken.  I called and complained and they offered to put a credit on my account. Doesn't really do the trick when my meal at the time was ruined.  All in all, Chens can be summed up as inconsistent. Not a very good practice when there are several competing restaurants in the area with better prices and consistency.  5 stars when they're on. 2 stars because they've let me down more times than I can count.

2011-07-27,2.0,"I don't like sushi. The girl is nuts for it. Mention the idea of cold stuff, rolled up and wrapped in plants, and she's on board. After so many times of hearing, ""God, I wish you liked sushi."" when we're trying to figure out a place to go for dinner, I discovered that some thai and chinese restaurants will also do sushi.  Here's the problem. Restaurants need focus. I understand the logic behind serving thai and sushi or chinese and sushi. It appeals to a broader audience and I'm all for that. However, it hasn't worked for me once. Everytime we've gone to one of these places, my meal has been mediocre at best. I'm pushing food around on my plate while the girl sits across from me doing a Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally. Chen's was no exception.  First of all, the place was deserted. Literally, us and one other table. We were sat at a nice table right by the window. Well, not exactly seated. More directed to that table and then asked to move back a table because that table was reserved. I was bummed because I really wanted to sit by the window and enjoy the breeze. Oh well, what can you do.  Our server was totally pleasant. He mentioned the lack of business numerous times when he checked on us, just so he knew he wasn't hovering.  The food: As per usual, the lady enjoyed her sushi and her summer rolls. She was totally satisfied. I had the sesame chicken. It was not the crispy nuggets of salty chicken slathered in a deep reddish brown sauce that I'm used to. I got kind of flavorless chicken, lightly breaded, and drizzled with an orangey, kind of bland and overly sweet sauce. I ate about half and had to take home the leftovers because it was too expensive to just let it go to waste. We'll see if the leftovers hold up.  All in all, the experience was just fine, I was just not impressed by the food. If I hadn't had a Groupon, I would've felt like my wallet had been violated. Needless to say, I won't be going back. Oh, and the reserved table never got used.",0.9218,0.853,0.089,0.058,0.5792293233082705

While a little pricier than some of the other Chinese locales, the food quality is also a step up so that is fair. Chens also often has coupons available that make the pricing a bargain and on weeknights Chens offers great specials on wine (some nights) and their vast martini list (other nights).  Our servers have generally been friendly and Chens also offers fun activities such as a very reasonably priced New Years Eve package (we attended and had a fun time), martini making classes, American Idol viewing parties, etc. The food is consistently good; my favorite is the Mu Shu raps and my wife particularly enjoys the Orange Chicken. Their appetizers are quite tasty as well (the crab won tons and the sushi sampler are our favorites). So long as we live in the neighborhood we will be regulars at Chens.

I worked with Sandy who has been nothing but a pleasure to work with and she worked with me to make a affordable arrangement for my party.  I paid $15PP for four appetizers and four entrees.  After shopping around this was a great deal, also to find out if there wasnt enough to go around the first time she would refill the dish. Also, since this is one block away from Wrigley Field I was nervous about all of our friends and family finding parking.  But there are two lots, one on the side of Chens and one behind.  I spoke with Sandy and she said she spoke with the owner of the lot and they would keeo it open for our guest.  There was confusion as to what lot to park in at first but instead of paying a paybox everyone had to pay $10 parking in the lot for two hrs.  Anything over it would be $20 on top of that.  I was told they normally charge $30 for the first 2 hrs.  So I guess we lucked out with that. I love the feel of the restaurant, open windows...swanky.  It just looked like this place was going to deliver on food as well.  I am sad to leave a review that I wasn't pleased. For appitizers we had Spring Rolls-which were waaaaaay to pepper like.  Very disappointing that I couldnt enjoy it or anyone else because of the overload of pepper in them.  Fried Pot Stickers, they weren't that great either but after dousing it with sauce it was more edible.  California Rolls-this was just eeeh.  I am more into elaborate rolls but I wanted to suit everyones desire so I stuck with simple.  I've had better but sad to say this was the best we had.  I also had the salmon roll, for the sushi lovers but there ws nothing to love about this roll.  I barely tasted the salmon.  Sad. For main entree we had Sesame Chicken, this is a house special and they do make thisw to perfection.  It's the best sesame chicken I have ever ever had.  sad to say, I had no leftovers on this but plenty of leftovers of everything else that I never ate.  We also had Shrimp Pad Thai, not only was the sauce watery but the shrimo was weird.  Not good at all.  Chow fun, just not right.  Wasn't good.  And Beef Mongolian, Gross.  Just gross.   I hate to leave this review but I am a food snob, and when paying for a ;large party not only I want to be happy for what I am paying for but everyone else and I dont feel Chens have meet that standard.  boo  BUT, I would go back there anyday I am in the area for there sesame chicken, hands down the bomb!!!  You wont be disaapointed with that, worth going to for that alone.",0.9935,0.691,0.184,0.125,0.5887270463741052

Then he ordered a Salmon dish. This was the biggest portion of salmon I have received in a restaurant in my life. The salmon was fresh, flaky, and flavored just right (try saying that 3 x's lol!).

2011-06-02,2.0,"Chen's has amazing customer service so it pains me to write this review. They also make some of the best sesame chicken I've ever had. However, my most recent experience has left me uncertain as to whether I'll order from them again. I recently had some friends over and after going on and on about how great Chen's is, we decided to order some grub.  Apparently when one orders the same thing for two years, it's hard to determine if a restaurant is really that great or not. I got the sesame chicken and was perfectly content; my friends did not fare so well. A breakdown of the offending food items: 1) Beef + broccoli - the beef was *literally* inedible in that I could not even eat a piece of it to completion, I had to spit it out. It was soft and mushy and pretty much the opposite of how you want beef to taste. Ick. 2) General Tso's chicken - they did honor my friend's request of having all white meat chicken. Which would have been great if the chicken hadn't been through the deep fryer about a billion times. Breading up the wazoo and very little chicken. 3) Orange chicken - this was OK, but there was a lot of goopy sauce with overly breaded chicken once again. We also ordered steamed vegetable dumplings (so-so) and crab rangoon, which was delicious but when is deep fried cream cheese ever not? We all ended up eating my sesame chicken which bummed me out because there's nothing like Chinese leftovers and I ended up having none. :( What else bummed me out? Paying $60 for food when I ended up throwing out 3 of the entrees. Moral of the story: if you find a delicious item, stick to ordering that and that alone.

We arrived 10 minutes early and had to wait forever in line. Once in, we were ushered to the bar area which was packed! We were told a back room would be opening up.

Not being one to care that much of the decor, I was pleasantly surprised by the modern layout of the restaurant.  The inside was dimly lit, so even at 5pm the place had a more intimate feel to it.  It seemed that things were well spaced and not too crowded, but that was probably more due to the fact that restaurant was more or less empty.  5pm Tuesdays for Sushi are probably not the most crowded night Chen's has seen... To the food... Chen's supplied a wonderful mix of crab rangoon, vegetable rolls, pot stickers, and enough sushi to give mercury poisoning to a large animal... You know I'm only kidding y'all! Once appetizers started dwindling, the staff made sure to bring out more plates.  I found myself slowly adding mental tallies after each polished off pot sticker, and I didn't quite mind because they were so good.  The vegetable rolls, crab rangoon and sushi were all pretty good as well. I was really feeling the spicy tuna rolls.  Maybe thats because I just can't identify the names of others, but this one was one of my favorites of the night.  But the real winner were the nigiri options.  It was either halibut or sea bass, but oh man! it was healthy and yummy.  Had they not run out of it, I would have gone for plenty more.  Great job Chens.

Now, I'm going to say off the bat that I personally find it to be difficult to get really good chinese food outside of Chinatown and my go-to spot on Broadway (Sun-Wah) but for a restaurant that caters primarily to a clientele with a more westernized palette - they're passable.  I usually shy away from pan-asian style restaurants because, let's face it: Asia is really big. You can't possibly be THAT GOOD at that many styles. That being said, I haven't had anything that was terrible by any means. For a place that lists Chinese first Sushi second, I have to say that I was underwhelmed by their Chinese selection. They have some good dishes but overall, I would've liked more variety. They do tend to cook on the sweeter-soy based spectrum of Chinese cuisine. And I have to say that their portions aren't matched well with the actual pricing. I don't really care much for their spring/egg rolls, and their sweet and sour dishes are kind of off.

Being the case, lots of people were in Chen's on a Wednesday night because the food, the atmosphere and the location. A friend and I split a wonton with crab meat, Mongolian Beef and Kung Bao Shrimp. The server was quick and got us $3 Sapporo (this is also their everyday special) very quickly. The menu was deep with sushi, Thai food, and Chinese food - we were all-in for Chinese and decided to stick to that side of the menu. The wontons came out first and were huge, we were very hungry and ate them lightning quick. The wontons came with a sweet and sour and a hot mustard, but it was hard to find any crab meat biting into the crab rangoon. Despite this, it had good texture and sharp flavors from the sauces. The server came back several times and my water glass was never empty. Next came our Mongolian Beef and Kung Pao Shrimp. I've got to say that the Kung Pao's spiciness was way too low for this dish. We had to ask for extra chili oil to get that dish to the right. The shrimp had good texture as it held firm with every bite. I really enjoyed the Mongolian Beef despite all the veggies they tried to load down onto the plate. Dishes came served with a large bowl of brown rice which I enjoyed but my friend did not.

If you're gonna do Chinese, do Chinese. You can't do Japanese too!  It's just not AUTHENTIC.  It's like, would you go somewhere that serves German AND Italian food?  Sounds crazy, right?   But anyways... our friend called and asked if we wanted to go to Chen's for dinner. He had a coupon. He wanted to share.  I'm a sucker for a coupon.  Can't say no.  So we went.  I kinda walked in expecting to hate it, honestly, which is probably why I was so very impressed.   Dude and I started with the sizzling chicken rice soup.  It was delicious!  I wish they had waited to put the rice in until they were table side (we had to explain to our friend why it's called SIZZLING rice soup when there was no sizzle involved) but it tasted yum so it was no biggie.  $3.50 is a little steep for what we got but I was hit with a case of the pregnancy starvings and I needed food ASAP.   Dude ordered a combination wor mein.  Our friend had the pineapple beef.  I didn't try our friend's dish but I had some of the wor mein and it was good.  I've had better but it was enjoyable. NOW... I ordered the sesame shrimp.  I see why it is the most popular dish on their menu.  It was actually freakin' awesome.  My Dude tried some and was also impressed.  The other half of that bad boy is sitting in the fridge waiting for me to happily consume for dinner tonight and I can't wait.   Our server was super nice and attentive.  I saw some complaints about the hostess on Yelp... we didn't have that experience at all.  She was super friendly.  The restaurant is very clean and modern and not at all like a real Asian place... which is probably why it was filled with Caucasians and not Chinese people.  Haha!   Will we be back?  We'll see.  While the food was good, it was a little pricey.  My heavenly shrimp were $14.95 I think which is slightly on the expensive side for a Thursday dinner out at an Asian place.  However, we filled out some stuff for $20 off coupons and if I had one of those, I'd order in a heartbeat.   Don't go expecting authentic Chinese or Japanese cuisine.  Don't go to ANY PLACE that serves a combo of Asian cuisines and expect authentic.  However, this place was delicious.",0.9976,0.759,0.195,0.046,0.5104146141215108

Yet, there are a few nit-picky details that bothered me, and that would never fly in an authentic Chinese restaurant. 1. The food pieces were too big to be eaten with chopsticks. The reason why Chinese dishes should have bite-sized chunks is so they are easy to transport from plate to mouth. The chicken pieces were as big as golf balls and I had to cut them with a knife. It was barbaric. 2. They proudly proclaim that they serve brown rice. Um, okay... is that supposed to impress me? The reason people don't eat brown rice in Asia is because it's gross.  3. No MSG. No MSG?!? What were they thinking? MSG makes mediocre food taste great! I don't understand the demonization of MSG in this country. That would be like an Italian restaurant proudly proclaiming, ""No cheese!"" Sorry, Dr. Chen, but your middle-of-the road American-Chinese food was not delectable enough to make that sacrifice. The food left my umami-sensors crying out for what they (thought they) ordered!  On that note, here's an article on MSG for those of you who are interested:  guardian.co.uk/lifeandst… The title is rather fitting: ""If MSG is so bad for you, why doesn't everyone in Asia have a headache?""

And the chunks of chicken were too big for chopsticks, even for an able-handed chopstick technician like me.",0.9201,0.799,0.171,0.03,0.3211538461538461
2010-08-20,5.0,Chens is the best. Service is excellent. Decor and atmosphere is also great.   Most importantly the taste is fantastic. Shrimp fried rice has large perfectly cooked shrimp- I also pay $1 more for extra veggies and get big hunks of veggie goodness. Chicken Kung Bao has great spice and I get low fat prep and it tastes great. What really sends Chens over the top for me are their specials and incentives.  Sign up for their email list and get $20 gift certificate.  First time ordering free appetizer.  Free birthday week meal. Specials in the week.  They really provide excellent overall experience.   There are so many things I love about Chens,0.9948,0.605,0.372,0.024,0.5704761904761905

2010-08-08,4.0,"I have been wanting to try Chen's for quite a while, but nothing like a Groupon to motivate me.    I have to be honest that I am often critical of any restaurant that proposes to do both Chinese a sushi well.   My experience at Chen's proved to be very good one.  The menu has ample selections of Chineses dishes.  Chen's has one menu feature I have never seen before in a similar restaurant.  They have a ""healthier option"" available for several dishes that substitues stir-frying for deep frying and uses less oil overall.  The Maki selection was decent, but not great in my opinion.  We ordered Szechwan Chicken (healthier option) and several maki rolls.  The chicken dish was a huge portion, yet very delicious.  The maki rolls were good, but certainly not the best I have had.    As for the service....Outstanding!  Our glasses were never empty and our dishes rolled out one after another.  It was honesty one of the best service experiences I have had in Chicago.   The ambiance was also excellent.  This was one of the nicest and cleanest Chinese restaurants I have ever been to.  Excellent space for a dinner for two or a group of 15.  On this visit, we had a great seat overlooking Clark street with the window open.   Chen's supposedly has quite an email coupon campaign as you will see from other reviews.   I am looking forward to receiving and using mine in the future.   Good food, wonderful ambiance, great service - 4.5 stars.....",0.9876,0.705,0.202,0.094,0.5417113095238095

I also tried the edamame appetizer which was fantastic - well salted, not overcooked.  The atmosphere was great. There is a lot of space (especially compared to sister restaurant Koi,) it was quiet, and the tables were well spaced out so you weren't overhearing everyone else's conversations.  The raspberry margarita was pretty awesome too - strong enough, good icy texture and flavorful.  All in all Chen's was fantastic.

Their sesame chicken is to die for--perfect balance of sweet and salty. Their California rolls as an appetizer were pretty good, but not mind blowing. The atmosphere is very calm and the servers are all very attentive. I think it'd be a great first-date restaurant.

We normally don't order Chinese, and go with Thai or Vietnamese.  However, our friends said this place was good and fast, so why not?  I will start out saying that the prices for dinners are kind of high.  But you do get a ton of food.  The best part of what we ordered: the sweet n sour chicken, and the schzewan eggplant.  Otherwise, everything was average.  The biggest let down from me, was that I wanted to try something new and different so we ordered the Mu Shu wraps.  Now, I was thinking the wraps would be homemade, maybe potato or rice... not just store bought flour tortillas.  Really?  I know it kind of describes the Mu Shu wraps like burritos, but I thought the flour tortillas were unappealing and cheap. One other thing, in case the restaurant staff reads this - better descriptions on the menu would be helpful.  We order the Mu Shu chicken and Mongolian Chicken, and had a hard time telling them apart.  More menu details please! - thanks.",0.9791,0.839,0.142,0.019,0.5571873911529083

It was a bit chewy and stuck to my mouth/teeth.   The service was very good and the staff friendly.

On the one hand, they have half-price martinis on Thursdays.  On the other hand, out of over a dozen varieties there are only two without some cloying fruit flavor, and those two have either sake or wasabi.  How about just a regular martini? On the one hand, they have a large menu, but on the other hand, nothing really jumped out to grab me.  It was all traditional mid-scale Chinese with a bit of Thai and some sushi. The szechwan plate was phenomenal--simple, clean flavors and lots of vegetables.  Unfortunately, that was not my entree--that hand held the sesame chicken, which was overwhelmingly sweet.  The dish was great otherwise, just way too sugary.  It was as if they made a really good version of sesame chicken and then doused it in honey.   On the one hand, I enjoyed the maki flight--only $5.95 for two pieces each of california, spicy tuna, tropical seafood, and one other slightly complex roll which slips my mind.  Overall B+.  On the other hand, the summer rolls were so, so bland--nothing but shrimp, cucumber, and lettuce. And finally, the aggravating bait and switch:  On the one hand, they have people sign up for their mailing list and then send them coupons such as $20 off dine-in.  On the OTHER (under)hand, the fine print states that these coupons cannot be used in conjunction with other offers.  Which is pretty standard, except that in their eyes, the half-price martini special constitutes another offer.  Perhaps a fine distinction, but I find it dubious.   However, I will say that the server took an entree off the bill in honor of the birthday girl, so technically they combined two offers for us--the martinis and the usual birthday deal--so we didn't feel totally gypped.  We just didn't save as much as we thought that we would.

That said, everything tasted delicious and I will definitely go back there again.  I just would order more of the ""normal"" rolls than the oversized specialty rolls.  Also, definitely get the brown rice when you're there over the white rice - it was perfectly done, with a nutty delicious flavor and cooked to a perfect texture (just a touch past al dente).",0.9881,0.796,0.196,0.008,0.45684523809523814

The rolls were just alright while the won tons/rangoon were fairly standard. Next we ordered some maki which was quite tasty. For my entree I had the thai curry with tofu. At first I was pleased with the spicy kick and really fresh veggies but after a few bites I was overwhelmed with how sugary the sauce was. I mean, this sauce was almost syrupy and I couldn't eat anymore.

Then I completely forgot about the place. Until I went to a Cheeky Chicago event and got a $20 off coupon. I'm a sucker for a deal. Went there with a friend, total bill was $20 after. They handed us each another coupon. Went again, another coupon. Went again. I think the tornado of coupons was some sort of anniversary promo. Went on a Tues, got a half-priced bottle of wine, two entrees, a piece of sushi for $30 altogether. They boxed up our leftovers with a carton of rice per person. My only complaint: wish they would have included a soy sauce packet. One coupon left.",0.7256,0.84,0.087,0.073,0.4694444444444445

The delivery guy was polite and efficient and very cool when my dog ran through the doorway to check him out. Once he left, the remaining experience fell apart. Rice was overcooked and cold. The sesame chicken was a fair complement: cold and overcooked. The ""chef special"" was advertised as shrimp, scallops, crab, and dover sole??? for 13.95. Plenty of shrimp, crab stick was terrible, scallops were so over cooked I wondered if the cook who prepared them was somehow angry towards them- maybe the process of shaving them paper-thin is a tough job, and the fish was regrettably forgetable. The brown soy sauce lacked any flavor, acidity, or seasoning and the vegetables were an ecclectic mix of unevenly cut and overcooked/totally raw product. If the same cook who meticulously shaved the scallops had also prepped the veg, at least the medley would have been pleasing to the eye. The whole meal was a trainwreck.

I went on a holiday weekend so people were still in a celebratory mood. The seating and lighting where nice.

He was in the mood for chinese so we went to Chen's Chinese & Sushi. He ordered one of the specials which was a chicken dish, fried. It had sweet and sour sauce all over it. It was pretty good but he complained that hardly any of the fried pieces had any meat in them. Most of it was just breading. I believe the cost of his dish was about $12. That's a chunk of change for fried sweet and sour breading with a little chicken here and there. He said he wouldn't order that again, but that he'd had other things before that he really liked so he'd just order something else next time. I had the Green Rose special maki. It had avocado, shrimp tempura, cream cheese, and asparagus in it. The seaweed they used seemed pretty thick, and I'm not a huge fan of seaweed anyway, but this was extra hard to get through. When the roll came out it was beautifully plated and tasted great, there were just certain aspects of it that I didn't like. I also ordered the spicy tuna maki which never came. We weren't charged for it though either, and I was full besides. So I guess that turned out ok, but still a tad annoying.  The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and modern. The seating leaves a little to be desired. The chairs have ZERO cushion on them. Literally wooden chairs covered with some material and no softness added to the seat at all. I sat across on the bench seat and our table happened to be placed right where the benches came together so I was basically straddling the wooden framing. Ouch.

We got General Tao's Plate and Szechuan Plate, both of them with chicken and beef with the low fat option. Unfortunately, they were both mediocre. I loved the huge portions and the crispness of vegetables, but the sauces were laden with cornstarch and within minutes the beautiful dish just looked like a congealed buffet that sat out waaaay too long. I was also not a fan of the meat itself. Both the chicken and beef were mushy and without looking at them, you wouldn't be able to discern one from the other by texture or flavor. Even the rice was blah- instead of sweet, fragrant jasmine, we got boring white long-grain. But I'll note that they do have a brown rice option and when we got our leftovers home, we discovered they gave us more rice (since we'd eaten all ours at the restaurant). But in the end I felt the dinner overall was not unlike the food at Panda Express. Don't get me wrong, Panda's fine when it's fresh- it's just not authentic.

It was a real surprise, because I have passed by this place for years and never went in, because I thought it was a Wrigleyville trap.  My husband and I went in last night and decided to splurge. We ordered a little bit of everything. We started off with our usual; ginger salad for him and miso soup for me. We traded off half way through and didn't even finish the salad. We then had the sushi platter. It had 8 good size pieces of California roll and 8 pieces assorted sashimi. All of which were perfectly crafted and delicious. For our entrees we had the lemon chicken and General Tao's with chicken, shrimp and beef. The portions are HUGE! Albeit, we ordered a lot of food, but everything we had was served elegantly and in abundance. I don't get general Tao's very often (I don't even want to think about the caloric intake of this meal), but I absolutely loved it! The lemon chicken was also great. I loved the fruity flavors of pineapple and mango.  Although we were stuffed to the brim, my non-dessert eating husband decided to order the pineapple coconut cheesecake. The dessert was very tasty, the only thing I will mention is that it was very slightly frozen towards thickest part. I know restaurants freeze desserts like cheesecake, so I wasn't turned off, but it should have been thawed a bit longer, especially since it was 30 degrees out last night.  My two favorite things about the restaurant, other then the food, was our server. She was soooooo cute! She was literally half my size and I am 5'4 and a size 2. She offered us brown and white rice and never said no. She was prompt in taking our plates away and made our dining service great. The second thing I loved was the room.

The decor on the outside makes one feel as though they're about to enter a relaxing and professional dinner place. The blue lighting around the perimeter of the ceiling in the dining room is a beautiful touch, as are the wood floors throughout. I found the most friendly staff, though, to be the backwaiter who directed me to the restroom upon my entrance.  That being said, our waiter was simply awkward. Not in the charming sort of way, but awkward in an almost creepy, the-atmosphere-that-surrounds-him-made-me-feel-uncomfortable sort of way. He arrived at our table promptly after following me from the restroom. I had barely sat down and not removed my jacket when he said ""S'up?"". I looked around at the nice surroundings and table cloths and just the fact that this restaurant operates on a front waiter/backwaiter service, and found his attitude to be completely unfitting. Perhaps he is aware of his own awkward and misunderstood personality and was trying to be the cool waiter? The kind where you feel like you've entered their dining room as a favorite personal guest? Whatever the cause, my date and I agreed that he was a little awkward and made us feel weird. He also made me feel almost guilty for not ordering wine or a cocktail after my date had ordered sake. They do have a nice wine list, which I'm sure if I'll go back I will partake in.  My date ordered the sesame chicken, and I ordered the Kung Bao tofu. We also ordered crab rangoon. Since moving to Chicago, I have not tried out my crab rangoon and I simply loved it. I am a hard judge, as I can direct anyone in any city I've previously lived to great crab rangoon. The dough in the middle pocket is wonderfully gooey but not soggy, and the more fried parts on the outside of the bloom have a great crunch and taste wonderful alone or dipped in the hot mustard/sweet and sour sauce mix. The filling is not too sweet, and wonderfully seasons with scallions. RECOMMENDED! The sesame chicken actually tasted like sweet and sour chicken. It was so covered in honey that I felt bad for my date who usually prefers a more salty taste to his food. He got a few bites in and said ""This is like a dessert."" I let him have as much as he wanted of my kung bao tofu, which was great. It left my mouth on fire, but in a good, ""i'm glad I ordered spicy food"" sort of way. The zucchini and yellow onions cooked into this dish had fantastic texture and flavor.  I would go back again, but perhaps just for the crab rangoon and a drink at the bar if I were staying there.

The sushi is definitely not good, so I wouldn't advise ordering from there- you'd do better eating grocery store sushi, really. Which is saying something.  The sesame chicken is actually just chicken mixed with sugar and honey and (sometimes) there are sesame seeds sprinkled on top. Really crazy sweet, I don't know why the menu indicates that it's spicy. The General Tso chicken was very heavily breaded (which I'm not a fan of), as was the orange chicken. The hot and sour soup just tasted like dishwater with a lot of black pepper in it. Again, not spicy.

Usually, when my friends prefer to get delivery, it means that there's not much to the restaurant, and you might as well get take-away and enjoy the atmosphere of your living room instead.  With that in mind, Chen's really surprised me - the restaurant is simply but beautifully decorated, they leave the windows open in the summer (I'm a huge fan of that, I don't know why), the servers are perfect at gauging when you need another drink, and there's just a very nice, chill atmosphere to the place. The crab rangoon (or crab meat wontons, or whatever they call them on the menu that isn't ""crab rangoon,"" but they actually ARE crab rangoon) here are excellent. They also come in a ginormous order that is possibly too much for one person - I was expecting maybe 4 of them and got like, 10. Ok, so I love crab rangoon, and this wasn't a problem, but we weren't quite expecting that big of an appetizer. My friend and I each got an order, and since it's pretty much criminal to leave crab rangoons hanging out on your plate, neither of us finished our dinners.  I got the crispy duck, and it was delicious. Well, the four bites I had room for after all of the crab rangoon were delicious, anyway. But wait! There's more. So, I didn't finish my duck, and I got it packed up in a doggy bag, right? On the way home from Chen's, I decided to visit my roommate at her bar, which meant I had a nice long stroll down Sheffield with this doggy bag full of duck. Well, the bouncer at Trader Todd's looked kind of bored standing outside, and I know I always like random food at work, so I offered him some of the duck as a snack. For some reason, he didn't think I was weird, and he gave it a try. The next night, when La Roommate and I were walking to Redmond's for wing night, the same bouncer was outside, and he yelled to us ""Hey! Where was that duck from?

A few days ago I decided to mix it up a little and try some sushi.  Great quality, especially for delivery sushi.  And the edamame side was enormous, which is important to me (see previous discussions of still-going-strong edamame obsession).   The best thing about Chen's, in my mind, is their promptness with delivery.  I don't live all that close to the restaurant, but I often get my food in less than a half hour.  The online ordering is very user-friendly and convenient.

So my boyfriend and I did just that -- who can a resist a two-for-one deal?  For delivery we ordered the sweet and sour chicken dish and general Tao's chicken both which were superb with brown rice. We had enough for two meals, so even though it seemed pricey, it was worth it. Delivery was prompt, and again, who can beat the $20 gift certificate.  Tonight we decided to put the certificated to use. It was a beautiful evening and Chen's had all of the windows open. It was a great time sipping on beer, noshing on sushi, and people watching. Our waitress was adorable and on top of everything.  As for the food, the Unagi Maki was the best I have had in Chicago. The spicy tuna was definitely spicy, but mediocre in terms of quality. Since we didn't learn from the enormous amount of food we were given during our delivery experience, we also ordered the mongolian chicken, which was a light sweet dish with plenty of crunchy scallions. While I thought it could use more sauce (I love love love sauce), it was an excellent light entree to compliment our sushi appetizer.  bottom line: I'll definitely be going to Chen's again.",0.9956,0.771,0.229,0.0,0.6666666666666665

I waited patiently, but as soon as the timer went on an hour and 20 minutes, I was extremely annoyed!  I called to check on the status.. 1) the man who answered the phone put me on hold as soon as he picked up, 2) when I very politely asked about my delivery, they very RUDELY and ABRUPTLY told me ""it 's on the way (click)"".  But I thought, at the time, it's ok, I have some good food to look forward to.  General Tso's chicken seemed like a half an order, the sesame chicken tasted like it was the bottom of the basket because every bite I had had very minimal chicken.  It was ALL fried stuff..needless to say, gross.  And to top it all off, they gave us one set of chopsticks.  If the staff at Chen's actually thinks all that food was for ONE person, they must be nuts.   On a positive note, I had some sushi and it was 'ok'.   Original: One of the first sushi spots I ever went to in Chicago.  It was a great experience!  Very trendy, dim, quiet and yummy.  In the summertime, they open up their windows, as many of the Clark Street establishments do.  Wine selection is so-so.  Last time I was there, they were remodeling their little lounge/waiting area, which also impressed me the first time I went there.  However, I did, somehow end up paying $5 for some tea.. it must have been ""gourmet"", or perhaps ""organic""...

This place had stuck their menus all over the Lakeview neighborhood and Zachary and I decided to try it last week on that horribly rainy night (Thursday?). I ordered the warm duck salad, General Tao's, and sushi for Zachary. I also asked for the free vegetable fried rice that came with orders over $25. The woman taking the order had very nice phone demeanor. She said it'd take 45 minutes to an hour, but it took well over an hour to get there.  We were so hungry when the food came that we dug in without inspecting the order. 10 minutes into eating, I realized that the warm duck salad was missing. I called and the woman taking phone orders was once again really nice. Z and I were in a hurry so we couldn't wait for it to be delivered, so she offered me a credit on my account. I accepted the credit since I figured we'd order from here again sometime, but it was weird that I wasn't offered a credit to my credit card first. The General Tao's was pretty good, but it was a little too doughy and there were only about 10 pieces of chicken soaking in the monstrous amount of sauce in the container. Honestly, it seemed like too few pieces for $11.95. Z's sushi fell apart as he was trying to eat it. It was a mess. The vegetable fried rice was tasty and the portiion is very large, especially for a free item. To give you an idea, today I am eating my third and final serving of it for lunch.
