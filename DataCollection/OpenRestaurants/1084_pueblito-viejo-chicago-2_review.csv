2017-09-04,5.0,"Such a great place. So authentic...as evidenced by all of the Spanish-speaking families filling the dining room. While this is a Colombian restaurant, the menu bares many similarities to Panama, the country in which much of my family lives in. The empanadas were exquisite and flavorful (and well-priced). The fried red snapper and tostones brought me back to better times at fish shacks on the beaches of Central America.  Great service, strong drinks, and excellent authentic cuisine.

2017-08-12,4.0,"I was in love with this Colombian restaurant from the moment I saw walls made out of pennies and men with margaritas. There are three things every Chicago city girl wants when she goes out on the weekend. The first is good drinks. Like a martini or a margarita. We like them refreshing as we like them fruity as we like them picturesque. The second thing is ambiance. We like a cool sign, different decor. Something to text our tinder boys about or at least we do it for the gram. The last is a dance floor. I get that we are sophisticated, but we're also fun. And there's nothing more fun than dancing the tango. We started off with a martini - the bartender makes a fabulous French 75 and some apps. Here you won't find salsa and chip or tacos, but what you do find are mouth watering gordita's and empanadas. There are so many good dishes to choose from on the menu. It is filled with traditional dishes, using high-quality, locally sourced products. Classics include Bandejas, seasoned skirt steak served with red beans, rice, fried pork rinds, sweet plantains, egg, and arepa; Churrascos, flame grilled outside skirt steak, with fried sweet plantains, cassava, salted boiled potatoes and chimichurri; and Sanchochos, rich beef rib stew with potatoes, cassava, green plantains, and corn. After some light bites, we went big and had the most amazing steak on the menu - Churrasco Pueblito Viejo. This steak came out on a huge wood tray plated with fried sweet plantains, cassava, salted boiled potatoes, and chimichurri. We couldn't even finish half of it - so if you order this, I suggest sharing it. Then we couldn't turn down one of the most classic margaritas on the menu, which came with an upside down beer poured halfway into it. It was epic to hold and even more fun to drink in between runs to the dance floor.",0.9966,0.807,0.193,0.0,0.45026455026455026

The arepas can be shared with another person because the platter is large enough for two people. I ordered the breaded steak that comes with white rice and a plaintain. The food was well cooked and very tasty. My platter was large and it could have easily been shared with another person. I don't remember what everyone else had, but I loved my food. I drank a regular mojito, and it was very well prepared. The restaurant has a DJ and the music started around 9pm or so.

From the beginning the experience wasn't a good, we had to ask for the water, the birthday girl wanted to dance so she asked the server for a different music but his answer was ""No, that's on Friday and weekends"". I mean, What? We were the only people there just go to the computer and shuffle some Spotify, what's the problem?. -We spent all night asking for the water to be refilled-. Now the food, it was good. I had the churrasco, it was tasty, everything the yuca, the plantains, the potatoes and the meat. But the meat was way too greasy and had way too much condiments for my taste, maybe using only salt and pepper would be better for me. I also ordered a Fried arepa with cheese for $5, what a scam!.

We again came with a large party of 12 on a Sunday evening to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  Jeffrey immediately came over to introduce himself and explained his role after our disaster experience a year ago.  He's very much in tune to the needs of the patrons and has done some major improvements since our last visit. The facility was redone to make the space look larger.  The menu was updated to reflect changing tastes.  They have a decent wine list, specialty cocktails and full bar.  The menu is reasonable at below $20 per person (without drinks) and the food is still outstanding. We started with both chicken and beef empanadas.  Still the best I've ever had.  Beef is my favorite.  The entire table had a mix of different entrees and the beef plates were fantastic. Portions were extremely generous. Note the Churrasco ""Pueblito Viejo"" is enough to feed two people (especially after gorging on empanadas and Arepas).  Food was perfectly cooked-to-order. The only issue was with the service.  While nice and attentive, our server was a bit scattered... forgetting about some appetizers and an entree (we were almost done eating when that arrived for one of our guests).  To his credit, he is new to the role and likely needs some training, but he's a sweet guy and apologetic.  If nor for the service, i would have given this a 4-star rating.

My point it's, you shouldn't be talking about your costumers with other costumer, that's not professional. Plus, they are drinking and going to paid for their drinks.

We hung out, I had some water (which they charge you for) and she had a smoothie. Shortly after we were done eating we went to dance and the waiter quickly brought us the check and retrieved it. About 5 minutes later he came to us and said to us in Spanish that the owner wanted to let us know that there were many people waiting to come inside and basically asked us to leave. Seriously? I waited 40 minutes in the cold to get seats. That is absolutely no way to treat paying customers trying to enjoy a nice night and if the owner was so eager for us to leave, she should've come to us herself... it was absolutely in bad taste.  They of course did not ask the strangers next to us to leave because they were drinking alcohol, I assume.

It is the perfect place for a small group birthday celebration.  Pros: Generous amount of food, fantasy looking decor that mirrors a typical Colombian ranch. DJ is good, plenty of Latin music genres are played plus a few American classics. Great service. If you are still in dancing mode after they close at 2AM, you can just walk half a block north and there is a Latin nightclub that closes at 4 or 5AM (free to get in on Fridays).  Cons: Parking on the street can be tricky. Agua Ardiente shots are over-priced. No tap water available, you need to purchase a water bottle if you want water. Pros or Cons? you decide!: Venue is small including the dance floor, but for me that was great because everything (dance floor, wash-room, exit) was relatively close to the table. It is a loud environment, you don't go there for talking which I like as well. You get to know random people since some tables are shared.",0.969,0.828,0.14,0.032,0.5140350877192983

I LOVE Latin dancing, and of course Colombian food. Now I'm Junior At Colombia College in Chicago and I take my friends here all the time to eat and dance. The last time (and I mean very last time) I went there with my friends we took two busses in the cold to get there and waited an hour in line, but we thought it was worth it because of the experiences I've had over the years. The hostess stood by us for almost the whole hour and when it was finally our turn to be seated she remarked that we each had to spend $20 a person in food. This was definitely a new policy because we had gone back in January and ordered normally. Of course my friends and I were expecting to come in, spend money on food, and dance, but not $20 a person. We're college students on a budget. We are also all under 21, which means we can't buy alcoholic beverages. The best part about Pueblito was being able to eat good food and dance even though I was under 21. It was a place of family and friends, now its apparently a ""club"". When I asked her why she hadn't told us this beforehand (that whole hour she was standing there), she (with intense attitude) asked me if i expected to just take up room and dance without forking anything over. She said the $20 is because they have no cover. Earth to Pueblito...you are not a club. That is why you have no cover. She also stated that it was on the menu. That would've been just fine... if I was sitting at a table with a menu. I was standing in line, which means I didn't really have access to one.

The waiter started speaking to us in Spanish and was confused why we didn't answer him. I understand it is a Spanish restaurant but my friends and I are obviously American and speak English. That wasn't so bad he finally realized we didn't speak Spanish and then spoke to us in English. He took our orders but then when we asked any questions about the food he just reiterated the description on the menu. We got the food and it wasn't even that great. The menu said boiled potato but I didn't know it was going to be just a plan boiled potato not even cut or seasoned, as if it was just thrown on the plate. Then our waiter disappeared and we got a waitress who was even less helpful than the waiter. After we were done eating she took our food and asked if we needed anything else we said no, she walked away and came back with a pitcher of water to refill our water cups then she left again. After about 10-15 minutes she returned to ask if we needed anything we again said no we're all done so she left.

We started to put on our jackets getting ready to leave still thinking she was coming with the check. I started looking around and she was no where to be found. My friend decided to go ask one of the waiters if we could get the check. Finally our waitress brought us the check and we saw it was 84 dollars. Wondering why it was so expensive we noticed that 15% tip was added in to the bill. No wonder the service was so horrible!! Well my friends and I thought she didn't deserve that tip and we took back two dollars. I HAVE NEVER done that before but I was so disgusted by the service. Well the waitress came running after us down the block in the rain for her two dollars. After that we did give her the two dollars because that was the fastest I saw her move all night, so I thought she finally earned those two dollars!

I washed it all down with Cerveza Aguila and several shots of guaro. True to Colombian form, the interior is decorated in a rather eccentric way.  If you've ever been to Andres Carne de Res in Bogota or Dulce Jesus Mio in Medellin, then you'll know what I mean.  I really enjoyed it.  The service was excellent and prompt.  There were several groups of families there and plenty of people enjoying themselves on the dance floor.  I was definitely the only gringo in the entire place, which was an indication that it's a legit authentic Colombian restaurant.  Pueblito Viejo is a little piece of Colombia here in Chicago.  Me encanta!!",0.9904,0.82,0.18,0.0,0.5695216049382715

Moving along, we ordered rice and picadillo for my daughter, churrasco for my husband, and a bandeja for myself... My son was fine with just steAk and rice...

That's where trouble began. The place happen to be very popular. There was a constant and long line. People might have been waiting for an hour. So management and staff began to play different small tricks to get us out. When we ""did not get the message"" the manager came and specifically asked us to move to the bar area so she could sit people in line.  Ok, no problem we are moving to a bar to find out that there is NO space at the bar and there is nowhere to stand. And we are being constantly pushed by the staff .. until we had no choice but to leave.  Perhaps this type of behavior is acceptable in Colombia, but here? Not nice.

The Carne Asada at Pueblito Viejo was cooked perfectly and spiced to the nines with Colombian goodies. The rice was tender and delicious.  I have to admit, I loved everything that was served to us.

(and yeah, no one speaks much Engligh - it's not a schtick. so bring your high school spanish.  if you make an effort, so will they. to be fair, the menu says 'service will be as fast as possible' so your expectations are managed.) i ordered the bandejo carne (beans, rice, steak, plantain) and it was SO yummy. the beans were really good; the chimichurri sauce over the steak was perfect. everyone with me ordered the arroz con pollo and seemed to enjoy it but i was disappointed they were so safe.  be careful about their 'salsa' - it is super hot!  apparently, there's karaoke and dancing a couple nights/week, so be forewarned. this is not a quiet spot - the music and atmosphere is not boring. if you want discreet elegance, try Les Nomades. if you want good food and an 'other place' feeling, try this!",0.9906,0.713,0.258,0.029,0.6506000000000001

2010-03-20,4.0,"My first experience at Pueblito Viejo was ten years ago and I didn't quite remember the taste of the food but I definitely remembered the environment--Rainforest café theme but with a Latin touch. This restaurant has very few tables that sit a party of 2, so if you are on a date I hope you and your date are ready to interact with strangers, hence the ideal of sitting different parties together. I was also a little skeptical on their fish selection because they only have two options to choose from. Since I'm catholic and I practice the traditional no meat on Fridays during lent season I had the Pescado Enpanisado (Breaded Fish)--it was very tasty! No grease dipping from the plate, which has been my experience at other restaurants, and the coating, perfectly golden and crispy yet still juicy.",0.9716,0.764,0.181,0.054,0.4725555555555555

We were blown away by what was in store.  The place had SO much personality I forgot we were in Chicago.  Brian B.'s review was dead on.  The place was decked out from floor to ceiling.  Every inch of the place was covered. Since we were just passing through, we decided to have a quick drink at the bar.  The bar tender didn't speak much english but she could not have been any nicer.  Since I've never eaten Cuban Food before, we deiced to order an appetizer.  I wasn't blown away, it was a fried cheese/potato thing, kind of bland, but that won't deter me from going back.

2009-09-27,4.0,"Holy sweet lord baby jesus, this place is fucking mind-boggling. We ate here tonight completely on a whim; we were walking to the Hidden Cove from our house and our entire party collectively realized we'd been meaning to try the place for a while. We walked in and found the four of us crammed in a tiny vestibule on the other side of a velvet rope. This rope was attended by this middle-aged Colombian dude with a shawl over his shoulders, a vaquero hat on, and what appeared to be a ceremonial man-purse slung around his shoulder. He kind of looked us up and down for a minute, then nodded and unhooked the rope. (Success!) The decor at this place is off the motherfucking reservation. I have no idea what the walls, floors and ceilings look like underneath the foot or so of flowers and vines, but honestly there's no need to know. It's magnificent and loopy as hell. There was a fake banana tree with a goddamn serpent on it ""growing"" through our table. There was a deer head on the wall right next to the head of some unspeakably horrific and possibly mythical beast right next to a 19'' TV with a soccer match on it. There was a key rack shaped like a machete next to our table. YES ON ALL COUNTS. So, quick hits. Mojitos: FANTASTIC. Platter thing with many fried things on it: SOLID. Empenadas: THROUGH THE FUCKING ROOF. Refajo (pitcher w/mix of two South American Mystery Beers and S.A. Mystery Cola: BUY NOW. Margarita: LOOK, YOU CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING. The fifth star would be there if the servers hadn't taken kind of an inordinately long time, and if it hadn't been for PV's borderline hilarious policy of automatically adding a 15% tip for parties of *three* or more. Frequent diners out will notice this number is exactly half the number of diners at which the auto-gratting usually takes place. But fucking whatever. The food ranges from very good to mind-blowing (I say again: EMPANADAS POR VIDA), and is totally in keeping with what I've gotten at other Colombian steakhouses. (If you don't like lots of fried things, maybe you should consider not eating Colombian. Rather than bitching about it on Yelp. It's like complaining about the lake being too wet.) The drinks are terrific. The atmosphere, again, is insane. In a positive way. And the old guy at the door who decides who goes and who stays? Let's face it: Complacent, entitled whiners that we are, we need this. Because some random old Colombian dude looking at you, shaking his head, and not unhooking the rope for you could damn well end up being a catalyst for valuable self-reflection. Pueblito Viejo can change your life. As well it should.",0.9848,0.776,0.141,0.084,0.5491472175167827
2009-07-25,1.0,"I went here the other day with my boyfriend and his family at the suggestion of his mom. The empanada's were delish, but the buck stopped there. Boyfriend and I split a meal that was actually described as having ""assorted pork meats"", which really should have been a warning. Everything, from the pork to the yuca and plantain, tasted exactly the same, almost like it was tossed into the deep fryer together. I noshed a bit, and still somehow ended up feeling sick for two days (as did boyfriend). The rice and beans were tasty, but the beans tasted like they came out of a can. Glancing at the menu gave the impression that aside from a few items, everything was fried here. Even though the empanadas were tasty, I'll avoid this place unless I'm in the mood for stomach pains.",-0.8262,0.826,0.065,0.109,0.3008928571428572
2009-06-29,4.0,"Great food--even better atmosphere. Ever have one of those nights where you have no earthly idea where you want to go for dinner, so you just wander, wander, wander the city for hours, and finally you hit the point of ""Oh, what the HELL already!"" and stop at the next place you see? That's where my girlfriend and I were last night--we went for miles before we spotted the flashing lights and gaudy colors of the Pueblito Viejo sign. Didn't look like much, but we saw the word ""food"" on the marquee and went inside. And what an 'inside' it is. Picture the Rainforest Cafe, only with a Central American theme rather than endangered-species decor--and with a lot more crap stuck to the wall. The room would be twice as roomy, were it not for the fake banana trees springing up from the middle of the table, fake plants stapled to the ceiling, hats nailed to posts in the center of the room, etc. My eyes didn't know where to land. Well, eventually they landed on the menu, and I picked out the churrasco. Great choice--the skirt steak was perfectly marinated and cooked, with yummy plantains and maduros on the side. TONS of food served up on a wood plank, and I ate nearly every morsel. Also adding to the atmosphere: fabulous music, and the nicest, most attentive service you could ask for. Well, not perfect; the one star off is partly for the lack of vegetarian options (more seafood or veggie options would be nice), and partly for the relative slowness--not such a big deal, because the food is well worht waiting for.",0.9804,0.787,0.146,0.068,0.5487654320987655

2008-12-20,5.0,"I love the ceiling. It reminds me of my crazy 7th grade Spanish class. There is crazy sh** hanging everywhere -silk flowers, keys, signs with Colombian ""dichos"" [sayings]. I love it. It's a totally kitchy and unique interior. The food was really, really good and it seemed to be much cheaper in price than other Colombian places I've been too. We had a little viejito [older] waiter, Edgar. He was really cute and really accommodating. Even though I'm totally bilingual, he was trying his best to impress me with his English. You have got to have a cup of coffee. I'm becoming somewhat of a coffee snob in that I'm getting accustomed to really good [strong] Latin American coffee such as Colombian or Cuban. It's funny how our coffee tastes like water after you have had an authentic cafe con leche [coffee with milk]. I went here for lunch and did see the dance floor and large TV screen but didn't get a chance to see the nightlife crowd. -But I would love to go back and see the crowd.

2008-12-10,4.0,"Great Colombian food, unique atmosphere. The ceiling is a jungle like canopy of silk plants and there are toy monkeys hanging on the walls and in the bathroom.  An ex-boyfriend's Colombian family would come here all the time to eat and dance. On your visit, you may notice tables full of families and friends. An upper class Bogotano  was horrified when I took him here, but after enough time in the States, I bet he visits their Miami location. And, yes, it can be difficult for gringos to get in late at night when people want to dance. So dress the part and be able to speak Spanish.  I am sorry, where else are you going for your Colombian food? When ordering, it really helps if you speak Spanish.  If you are a darker shade of pale, the servers will likely attempt to use Spanish with you.  Order the beer mixed with soda (refajo), order anything with aguadiente. Arrepas and empanadas are good. The arrepas are the puffy kind, a bit different if you are accustomed to the flatter versions.

2008-02-17,5.0,"So, I was looking for an interesting place to take the lady for a belated Valentine's Day dinner. After stumbling across a picture of this restaurant on Facebook I was intrigued. The decorations (fake flowers across the whole ceiling, wood paneling, deer heads and plastic frogs and alligators on the walls) are really kitschy, but in a fun way. There's a small dance floor and a big screen blasting Columbian music videos, and had my ankle not been sprained I'd have loved to dance a bit. The service was pretty quick and really pleasant. I feel like the slight language barrier explained our server's awkwardness, but his smiles more than made up for the jokes we weren't able to share. The menu was filled with a lot of food that sounded really great. Be warned, most of the dishes contain pork or steak, but there were a couple tasty sounding fish and veg-friendly dishes. I ended up having the churrasco, a skirt steak with fried plantains, arepa and a baked potato. My girlfriend had a smaller steak with a bowl of beans and rice. All of it was excellent. The portions were huge, huge enough to satisfy my appetite and allow me a second tasty dinner the next day. We had a really great time sharing food and tasting new things, none of which disappointed. When the bill came, I was happily surprised at the tab. I feel like, for the quality of our time and our meal, we kind of got a steal.
