2017-08-25,5.0,"Better than Giordano's. TBD regarding Lou Malnati's. This restaurant deserves any acclaim and respect that they get. My family visited Pizano's during the Famous Food Tour of Chicago and my brother and I ordered a small take-out Meat Lover's Deep Dish Pizza today.  We each tried a slice of their deep dish cheese pizza and thin crust sausage pizza during the food tour. You could just tell that their tomatoes are pureed fresh at the restaurant, the basil aromatically wafts in the air, and the cheese is flavorful yet doesn't leave you feeling heavy afterwards. Everyone at our table was wondering where they sourced their ingredients, and how they managed to piece it all together into a deep dish pizza that left people wanting more without feeling terrible afterwards. The same goes for the takeout pizza we ordered; the only thing is that we wished it was more hot when it came out. Will be coming back here as my go-to deep dish pizza parlor. The interior is a traditional, family-style restaurant with mostly booths and some stand-alone tables. The servers were all quite nice and friendly and the place has a rich history too, better told by our tour guide than what I can paraphrase here. You'll just have to go in-person to find out!",0.9715,0.875,0.113,0.012,0.5552083333333333

Close by and really worth the walk! I have often tried chicago pizza but this was the best by my account. I loved the sauce and the crispy crust.  I also had the Tortelini soup and enjoyed that as well.  it was nicely seasoned and a great appetizer while waiting for the pizza.  Good service helped to make the experience great.

Anywho, I'd seen Pizanos around for a while and decided why not try it...plus they had available outdoor seating. #summertimechi  We ordered a large sausage and mushroom, thin crust pizza. Just when we started to get restless, about 40 minutes, we received the pizza. First and foremost, this was a SMALL large. It actually looked like a medium, at best. I mean this is Chicago and three native Chicagoans laughed when this pizza arrived. Chicago large? Ha! Italian restaurant large? Ha! Italian restaurant in Chicago large?! Hahahaha Okay, enough of that, on to the flavor. The crust was super crunchy and obviously a cornmeal crust. As thin as it was the crust was sturdy but not hard. The sauce was decent, the sausage standard. But the mushrooms were super small and scarce. At one point I separated the toppings from the crust to make sure it had mushrooms at all. Taste? Eh, it was okay. Not bad but not anything Isee myself craving or going out of my way for. Chicago just has too many good pizza options to pay $26 bucks for an okay medium (at best) pizza.  Service was also okay. Our waiter was nice but seemed timid and wasn't as attentive as he should've been. We also asked him how many inches the large pizza was. He responded, it was cut in squares and not measured by inches. Hmmmm, alright then. Next!",0.9886,0.737,0.187,0.076,0.4777922957801005

You can see in one of our pictures that parts of the outside crust were burnt but that didn't bother me so much. The bottom crust was, in fact, nice and sturdy and carried all the yummy ingredients to our mouths easily.

You are the manager.  We wait for the correct pizza, which comes out about 20 minutes later.  The manager does not offer an apology, does not offer a dessert, nothing.  The server was apologetic, but that hardly suffices for the whole bad experience after spending $150 on dinner and $30 waiting at the bar.  Daytime management seems a lot better.  I probably won't take business or out of town guests there again because they were clearly not impressed, but I might stop in for my pizza fix at the bar or take out area next time.",-0.5466,0.808,0.092,0.101,0.5421296296296296

The Caesar salad we ordered was seasoned well, with crisp and fresh-looking green lettuce that wasn't drowning in dressing. The bread basket could've been skipped though, as the bread was cold and dry, with a hard crust that lacked the fresh outer crunch of a fresh loaf of bread. My husband and I ordered a small pepperoni deep dish pizza which was the perfect size for us (it's about a 9"" pie pan size, with two slices per person). The pizza was tasty and hot, but the crust was yet another different kind I've not yet had: very crunchy and very rustic in its shape.

I was home for a visit and my parents and I were visiting the Art Institute so I looked up ""Chicago pizza"" on Yelp near the Art Institute and found this place. Normally I stick with the usuals- Gino's East, Lou Malnati's, maybe even Giordano's, but I am SO glad we tried Pizano's. This should be added to the list of best Chicago pizza- not just for their deep dish but also for their thin crust pizza. (I know they are on many lists already but I had never heard of them after 42 years of living near Chicago!)  We loved the feel of the place- definitely felt like a Chicago Italian restaurant. We had the pleasure of getting Uncle ""Chach"" as our server and he took the time to learn our names, part of our story, and gave us many compliments- so charming. He talked a lot about how he's been given awards for the best waiter in Chicago, but that he never reads the reviews about him. He's definitely a character but he treated us well and made my parents and I feel special and like our family relationship was special too. Service was great, the pizza was awesome- I loved the crust on both the thin and deep dish pizzas, and we all were happy with our food. My dad had some minestrone soup which was different than he was expecting- very thick and cheesy- and he thought it was tasty but very filling and it led to him eating only one piece of pizza! Uncle Chach surprised us with a free warm chocolate chip cookie pizza for dessert which was really fun.  This is a large place- they have a whole downstairs and it's pretty bustling at lunch time. You have to climb down a lot of stairs to get to the main restrooms (though there is one handicapped restroom upstairs) but then you get to see the rest of the restaurant that way too. My only complaint was the leftover containers were really flimsy styrofoam and kept opening in the plastic bags and slid all over the car- maybe they can consider investing in something better to hold that precious cargo- I'm a big fan of leftover pizza heated up in the oven (never the microwave!) so you want to make sure it arrives home safely.

2017-02-27,4.0,"Uncle Chach. I have to start with him because he'll make your experience wonderful. He comes to your table and bursts into your comfort bubble with volume and enthusiasm. I have to admit, I was a little annoyed at first - I'm not one for small talk. He engages you quickly and happily, learning the names of everyone at the table. He has suggestions, if you need them, and he's fast with your drinks. He checks on you a few times before your food arrives and slowly learns about you and your table. My boyfriend and his son had both gone to the bathroom and Chach asked me a few questions about us and our life. He remembers everything that you say and genuinely seems to care when he asks. After our food came he continued to check on us (as he did to all the tables in his section) engaging us in conversation and witty banter. He tells you about his life, too. The longer you're in his presence the bigger the smiles get. After you're done eating he spends a few more minutes with you - inviting you into his family. He'll be Uncle Chach to you from now on, and don't you forget it! I left feeling like I'd just had dinner with a long lost relative - one I've been missing and never even knew it.  One more note about Uncle Chach - you can request him when you make a reservation. He's the only waiter that has that distinction - I promise it'll be worth it. I miss him already :)  The food was great - as expected. We got a sausage pizza and the boys split chicken parm. The pizza reminded me somewhat of Home Run Inn. The sausage was great - not too salty like it can sometimes be. The chicken parm was good - not exceptional but definitely good. I also got an order of meatballs which I also enjoyed.  Uncle Chach ended our meal with a baked cookie covered in vanilla ice cream, homemade whipped cream and chocolate sauce. So good. So, so good.  We arrived around 12:30pm on a Saturday afternoon and it was busy. If you're going to go during peak meal times I suggest calling ahead or making reservations. It's a small place so you might have to wait but it's worth it. It's a Chicago experience and a place I'll definitely go back to.

Meat Lovers Deep Dish Pizza: Normally I'm a NY slice type of guy, but when in Chicago you might as well get deep dish. Loved the thick doughy crust and the generous amount of sauce to go with it.

So when my guy and I wanted to order some food on Saturday night while we were staying at the Silversmith Hotel (I live on the south side; he's on the north side-- it was a special occasion so we stayed in the loop) I thought ordering from Pizano's would be a good plan. It was not. We ordered two entrees and the (outrageously priced but just fine) mozzarella sticks. The chicken parmesan itself was decent, but the pasta with it was overcooked and had disappointing sauce. The second one, Pasta A ""La"" Franco, sounded wonderful (chicken and peas in light cream sauce), but unfortunately, it was borderline awful. The chicken in this dish was overcooked and the sauce was sandy. Off putting. A bummer. We ate some because we were so hungry (cue porn music), but didn't enjoy it and stopped as soon as the edge wore off. (Not unlike many women I know, I LOVE pasta, and for me to just stop is not a good sign for the pasta). To add insult to injury, when the delivery person arrived, he said ""I hope you have silverware because I forgot to put some in the bag."" Was he high? Why would we have utensils? Do people back their flatware in their overnight bags? We troubled the front desk for some utensils, but the whole experience was so annoying and disappointing that I doubt I will ever eat there again, even for pizza. And when I see my credit card statement, I am going to be so ticked off. I suspect the memory of that sandy sauce will flood back to my mind.",-0.9829,0.746,0.086,0.168,0.6388998357963873

2017-01-06,5.0,"Though this restaurant is not in New Jersey, I just had to post a review on it. My girlfriend and I were in Wisconsin for a wedding and out flight out was cancelled so we had to scramble last minute and got a flight out of Chicago early the next morning. After driving to our hotel, we decided to go into the city to see the Chicago Bean (or more correctly known as the Cloud Gate). While in the city, we decided it would be sacrilegious if we did not try a true Chicago Deep Dish pizza. After a bit of research and a desire not to walk or drive far, we settled on Pizano's, a fairly large pizzeria only a block from the park. The interior was busy with customers and waitstaff. There were photographs that adorned the walls and the seats were very comfortable. The pizzeria also housed a bar and several TVs where people could watch the latest sports games. Everything felt very authentic. The waiter informed us that the deep dish would take about 45 minutes to reach our table and, at first, I thought this was because of the high population in the restaurant. It wasn't until later that I realized that truly fantastic deep dish pizzas take a longer time to cook than the New York style I'm used to.  Now before seeing or trying the pizza, I have always joked with people that New York Style pizza is the dominant pizza style in the US. I always joked that Chicago Deep Dish was just a cheese casserole. After seeing and tasting the delicious creation brought to the table, I still think Chicago Deep Dish is a cheese casserole, but it is a delicious one at that. The cheese was so molten, it strung right off the slice as I cut it. The sauce was rich and tangy, but also slightly spicy. The crust was thick and fluffy, but crispy on the outside. This pizza was extremely filling and extremely satisfying. I was worried, at first, that we wouldn't get one of the better, authentic Deep Dish pizzas the area is known for, but after tasting this pie, I know that we made no mistake going to Pizano's. While I am not a local from the area and I don't argue that there are likely even better locations to enjoy Chicago Deep Dish, my girlfriend and I were definitely not disappointed with the pie we got. And though I'm still partial to New York Style, I definitely won't be so hard on Chicago Deep Dish from now on.",0.9893,0.832,0.126,0.042,0.5196762081455959

Actually, nothing in the cooler was cold at all, and I'm talking about, it was warm enough to keep my hands warm in the 0 degree weather. My boyfriend had asked the same woman if there were any cold beverages available, and we were answered with a ""no"". No apology. No effort to even offer to go in the next room over to get any. He had to go to a 7-Eleven nearby to buy our beverages. After receiving our pizza, we thought it couldn't get any worse--wrong. My boyfriend realized no pepperoni was included in his deep-dish. He brought his pizza to the front to point this out, and she told him, ""You've brought this to me after you already ate half of it?"" Seriously? He had to pull his pizza apart to make sure he wasn't going crazy and the pepperoni would be somewhere hidden within his food. She gave him another box of deep-dish, pepperoni present and all--except the pizza wasn't hot. It was slightly warm, if anything.

My dining companion is a fan of deep dish so I knew he'd be anxious for a pizza.   While it was somewhat entertaining to see the controlled chaos going on all around us while waiting for our table I knew the environment was definitely not conducive to a nice quiet meal out.  I'm sure the ambiance inside is less chaotic most nights, but I doubt I'd go out of my way to go back when visiting, as the food just wasn't as good as I'd hoped. Our waitress was sweet, trying to even out the table legs with folded napkins, but the table being wonky was just part of the experience.   The burnt deep dish, and the 'too mild' flavor of the Vincent's favorite just didn't blow us away with culinary delight.  The cheesy garlic bread was really good to start, as was the giant cookie dessert that wrapped it up, but with our main course being so disappointing (and slow to arrive) it was just not a great experience.  If I lived nearby I'd give them another chance perhaps, but as a visitor to Chicago I'll look elsewhere next time.",0.9277,0.754,0.154,0.091,0.5470085470085471

And to end this extremely delicious pizza night we had the deep dish cookie with ice cream.  Not being a huge fan of skillet cookies, I loved their version! Bottom was a hot, almost crispy thick piece of cookie.  On top of that was a thick layer of vanilla ice cream instead of just one small round scoop on top, giving each slice the perfect ratio of cookie and ice cream.  And even though I was beyond full, I ate two pieces.  Amazing stuff!  I'm incredibly impressed with Pizano's.",0.9974,0.679,0.299,0.022,0.6529189857761286

For pizza, we decided to go with a simple small sausage deep dish. I agree with another reviewer that the pizza wasn't what I expected as far as a deep dish crust. It wasn't fluffy, greasy or ""bready"", but the crust had a distinct crunch to it. I kept thinking that the crust reminded me of a pizzelle made of flour and water. The pizza had great buttery cheese flavor, a savory tomato sauce and tasty hunks of sausage. Most bites featured a flavor explosion of cheese, sauce and sausage, although a couple bites were light on sausage. Service at the bar was good, and the dining/bar area seemed well kept, but fairly nondescript.  I couldn't help thinking that if I lived in Chicago, I would probably end up at Pizano's for pizza fairly often because it wan't so fluffed up and filling, and maybe I could also convince myself that the pizza was a bit healthier than Giordano's or Lou Malnati's.",0.9394,0.88,0.098,0.022,0.5490079365079366

It is only a 5 minute walk from Millennium Park and definitely attracts a lot of business.  We ordered mozzarella sticks, hot buffalo wings, and mushroom risotto to start. The HOT buffalo wings are no joke, they deliver some serious heat! The wings were meaty and cooked to perfection, they did not taste like they were pre-frozen. The mushroom risotto (which is vegetarian) is very good compared to most places I've had mushroom risotto, it is cooked very well and the mushrooms are fresh but not overpowering.  Onto the main reason we came here, PIZZA! We ordered a large thin crust (sausage + veggies) and a medium thin crust (half veggie and half cheese). In addition, I ordered my own individual cheese + jalapeno deep dish pizza. The crust on all of these pizzas is the best I've had in Chicago. It was perfectly crispy, light, flaky, buttery, and golden brown. Out of all of the pizza places I've had in Chicago, Pizano's is definitely toward the top of my list.   They also have a great selection of beer! The service is very helpful and kind.

Come on guys, get it together. They hung at the basement bar and unfortunately I could hear the bar person talking about some ""D-Bag"" (I kept it clean here). Wow. The final straw: we were seated next to a family, luck of the draw I guess. The young girl was so disrespectful to her family....The icing was her picking the scab on her knee at the table.  Ugggggg.   Now clearly we understand it's is not the fault of the restaurant that we were exposed to such a terrible sight with bloody scabs, but the whole vibe was gone. Service could have saved the day.  We took the pizza to go instead of sitting there.  Got the pizza back to hotel around the corner: YUM. The crust is a little yeasty tasting for me, but the cheese and the sauce make up for it . It was still piping hot when we opened it up.  Pizza : 4*,Server: 1*,Basement Ambience:1*, Front Desk Guys: 4* Likely would try it one last time if we could sit anywhere but the basement.",0.7796,0.887,0.063,0.05,0.5527777777777778

We had both a thin crust and a couple deep dish pizzas, so it was a good sampling of their offerings. I was equally impressed by both thick and thin. I also understand that deep dish pizza slices can be tricky.

Once again was informed the pizza takes 30 minutes to make which was cool.  Small size for two people was very filling. This deep dish was not greasy and very enjoyable. The dough was nice and fluffy and the crust nice and crunchy (my favorite).  Cool side note. Apparently the owners of Pizano's are related to Lou Malnati's I believe in some way. That explains why both these locations are top notch for true Chicago deep dish.  The establishment itself was very large and they also have a downstairs.

I work in the loop, so I was coming off a long day of work. My hope was a quick slice of pizza and a beer - not a lot to ask for from a New Yorker? I was immediately proved wrong: I was told to eat the pizza here (and not carry out), I had to wait 30 minutes for them to make the pizza slice. The other option was go to their carry out section and take a 35 minute train ride to my apartment for the food to get cold.  So, hesitantly, I agreed to enjoy a beer in this nice ambience and wait for the pizza. While waiting a trip to the men's washroom proved to be distasteful. The restroom does not match the restaurant ambience, it was something I would expect from a dive bar.  I think the most notable part of this review, which brings the stars down, is that an employee of the restaurant left the washroom without washing his hands.  In summary, I was told there is a slice available now, but they refused to serve it to me because I was enjoying it at the restaurant. The restaurant sanitation needs improvement.

2016-02-16,1.0,"Pizano's does an awesome College Pizza night. If you're a college student and haven't checked them out on a Tuesday night after 9pm, you should. However, I work for a company that houses 4 universities and we like to take our residents on outings to familiarize them with the area and all of the amazing sites, food, and activities that Chicago offers.  35 of us ventured out to Pizano's on Madison street in September of 2015. We tried to make reservations and was told they don't do that on College night. No big deal we understand policy. We just wanted the staff to know they will be hit hard that evening.  We arrived and no one knew we were coming. For the first 30 minutes our group was dealt with as if we were a huge inconvenience to the Pizano's staff. ( we called and tried to warn management)  One male manager finally figured out a plan to get us seated in groups which was fine.However half of our party had to wait outside for an hour before being seated. No big deal we signed up for this and knew there were no reservations on college night. Everything went well after the hour wait. Although the pizza is free we still ordered $5 drinks and appetizers. which totaled to more than $300.  Fast forward to February 2016, I placed a call to Pizano's management to inform them that we would bring our group of 35 again. Also, that we tired to warn them in September but our message was not passed on to the evening managers and I would like to ensure they know we are coming and maybe they can prepare.  I was rudely told we don't do reservations by two mangers. Not a problem, I understand I just want to make sure that my students won't have to stand in snow and 20 degree weather. After much hesitation I was told that we could stand in the take out room, but in the same breath the it would be closed so they don't know what they can do. I  know from previous large parties that they have a lower level area but didn't mention it to the, clearly too busy for my conversation, managers. I would have preferred that either manager mention the lower level and offer it as a standing room until tables were ready. I understand that they may think we will mess up an area that's not being used and or they don't have the staff to clean the area on this specific night if it were to be left untamed by my students. (Which that wouldn't happen because they would not eat util they left the area the same as they found it, we don't play)  Waiting for a table is not an issue we understand the rules but not offering anything but an take out space that by the way will be closed is not ok. I wonder how either of them would feel if their children had to stand in the cold. It's the offer that counts and the way you speak to people.  I know my students are forever grateful for your college night special and return frequently after we host our ""Pizano's Pizza night"" program each semester.

(02) The crust is crispy and cornmeal-based, similar to Gino's East. (03) One piece of deep dish pizza isn't going to make you want to loosen your belt and take a nap.  You might even take on risk on two slices and feel okay. (04) The ingredients taste fresh, not canned.  I give a thumbs up to our palatable pie topped with garlic, basil, and sliced tomato.

And of course the pizza was ice cold so much so that the cheese was no longer melted.

2016-01-30,3.0,"I'm back with another pizza review in the loop area here with Pizano's. Ordered delivery for a medium thin crust half cheese half pepperoni, and an individual deep dish pepperoni and sausage. Not off to a good start, the thin crust was delivered with pepperoni over the entire pizza. Luckily my vegetarian friend was ok with picking the pepperoni off her only cheese half (my other vegetarian friends would not have touched it). The best way to describe both of these pizzas is Lou's little annoying brother who tries so hard to be like his older brother, but falls short in every way. One thing we noticed as a generality is the flavor here is weak. I hoped the more I ate it it would get better, but I was simply left unsatisfied. Second, you really don't get much here for what you're paying. Pizza is not dense enough to warrant the high price tag. Crust is crispy, good amount of cheese, and little amount of flavorless sauce. The ""deep dish"" had the illusion that it was deep because the crush edges are baked about 2 inches high only to form almost a bowl of sauce and cheese that is maybe twice as thick as the thin crust. Would I order again? Probably not. But was it the worst pizza in Chicago? It it about average. Needless to say if this is your first shot at Chicago style pizza, you will enjoy it, but there are much better options out there.",0.9027,0.817,0.117,0.066,0.494810606060606

But when you work 'til 11pm in the loop your options are pretty limited (this joint or Miller's Pub). From now on when I work late, my options are down to one. Here's the tale: Stopped in there a couple weeks ago after a late nite at work. Took a while to get seated. Then it took a good LONG while to order. At least 15 minutes. And that didn't happen til I flagged someone down. A few minutes after I placed my order, another waiter came by asking me if I was ready! Guy looked drunk. I sent him away. Food got there in under a half hour. But, I had only ordered a chicken sandwich and it's not like they were slammed. So... a bit too long. Sandwich was OK. Nothing special. But hey, it's almost midnight and I'm hungry in the loop. Fast forward to tonight. I'm hungry. It's late. I don't feel like spending 30 bucks at Miller's. So, Pizano's it is. Stand at the hostess stand about five minutes before anyone seats me. Not outlandish, but, I was the only one standing there. I'm famished. Thinking about a pan pizza to sate my growing hunger. I put my menu down. And I wait. And wait. And wait. 20 minutes goes by. NO water. NO waiter. Nothing. I say ""screw this"". I get up and start bundling up. Who do I see sitting at a table not five feet from me? That same drunk-looking waiter. He's talking to some friends. Not other employees I don't think. Maybe regular customers. He sees me putting on my coat.. He stands up from the table, takes his order pad out... then sits down again! As I'm just about to head for the door THEN he gets off his ass to try and take my order. What I wanted to do was give him the finger. Instead I just said ""If you're not interested in my business, I certainly don't plan on ever giving it to you again."" I implore everyone to never, ever patronize this restaurant. I've never said this on yelp about anything before, and I doubt I'll ever need to say it again. But, I'm dead serious.

We left them alone for two years and then last weekend I thought ""Hey, it's been a while. I'm sure they have their act together now. Let's order Pizano's"". I placed my order online and was given a delivery time of an hour. 90 minutes later, I'm still giving them the benefit of the doubt.

On their website, their delivery area goes as far south as 18th. I'm at the corner of State & 14th. So even though I'm well in their delivery zone, I do not receive the same quality of food because I'm ""so south"". Uhhh...yeah. If you cannot deliver consistent quality to your entire delivery zone, I recommend changing your zone. Or at least break the zone up in ""People who live an area who will receive our best food"" and ""People who get our 2nd rate food but we're more than happy to take your money even if it means you end up disliking us"".

2015-07-24,4.0,"Ironically, you can't buy a slice of deep dish pizza in downtown Chicago. That was the case up until recently when Pizano's on Madison and Michigan saw the need as well and made a separate section for those on the go. With the amount of foot traffic around Millennium Park, it's a surprise no one thought of this sooner.  I don't know the full story but it sounds like Pizano's is the love child of the great Chicago Uno's and Lou Malnati's. Once you take a bite, you can taste the family heritage. To me, I enjoyed it better since the crust wasn't soggy like at Lou Malnati's. The pizza itself is a miniature whole pizza pie with crust all around (about 6"" diameter) which is awesome if you love a bit of crust in each bite. You can get a slice of thin or deep dish pizza all the way up until 10pm. $8 is a small price to pay for Chicago deep dish pizza but for the location and not having to wait 30 minutes. It's ideal for those who want a quick bite whether you are a tourist walking around Millennium Park or happen to work downtown.",0.9934,0.777,0.209,0.014,0.58125

I can't really figure out what it is. It's pretty comfortable though. The first thing I was told was that I needed to go to Lou Malnati's to have the best Chicago pizza experience. It wasn't for lack of trying. Lou Malnati's had a stupid wait time when I tried going. I detoured to Pizano's. Not a mistake. /FOOD Well, I tried to get the small version. Ended up getting the not-small version, but they were kind enough to adjust our receipt. Chicago pizza is not my favorite, honestly. However, I did like it. It's different. While I'm sitting here thinking about it, I have decidedly liked it more than I realized as I'm currently making myself starve. The pie crust was thick, crispy and good. The couple at the table next to us ordered fries to go with their pizza. Is that a Chicago thing? Man, I wish I had thought of that. Seemed like a small dish and an order of fries with ranch would have been just right. /SERVICE I am sad I do not know the man's name. He was a really great waiter. Attentive but not in your face.

So, beer is good as well. The pizza was ok. As for the deep dish, rather thin crust. Flavorless sausage and a bit too watery sauce. It's as if when they ladled on the tomato sauce, it was swimming in water. Meaning, when it cooked, it made the pizza a watery tomato'esque sloppy mess. The crust eventually absorbed some of it, leading to it being soggy as it all began to cool and congeal. Some rave about this place, but the next time I visit Chicago, I'll pass.

I took two slices - one sausage and one pepporoni.   Problem 1 - It was soggy. Nothing is worse than soggy pizza. Soggy deep dish is probably the worst of the worst. Aside from that I didn't find the crust or bread tasty. It tasted weird. Kinda chalky and crunchy rather than chewy.  Problem 2 - You could barely taste the toppings. I felt like I was eating bread and cheese. I honestly don't recall tasting sausage at all. If I hadn't seen the sausage with my own eyes I would have told you it wasn't there. The pepporoni wasn't much better. Problem 3 - Too much tomato sauce. I think their strategy must be to skimp on the toppings by drowning the pie in tomato sauce.  Overall, I wasn't impressed. The pizza had minimal flavor and even the addition of parmasean cheese with crushed red peppers didn't help it.

We were seated right away, in what looked to be a pretty busy restaurant. Close to a (mysterious) staircase. After we sat down a couple of minutes later our waiter arrived. He was a CHARACTER. Really funny, but after awhile it was like, okay dude chill. He was a good guy though, he just kept making the same joke. It was DEFINITELY an experience. Called himself the chach. Said he was in a magazine recently. But he did make a killer orange soda and give us pretty good recommendations/service.  Found out the stairs lead down to the bathroom. And other hidden rooms that seemed to have a party happening. A little strange, but it's Chicago so I try not to question the way they work their space. So we ordered the sausage and mushroom deep dish pizza and one friend ordered a pizza burger and said it was delicious.  The pizza was definitely one of a kind. We had to wait at least thirty minutes for it to cook. Which seemed a little long, but it was worth the wait. The pizza sauce was fresh, and very tasty. It had a thicker (chunkier) sauce that was mainly fresh tomatoes. Sausage was homemade, and flavorful. Crust was perfect. Food was great, definitely wouldn't mind bumping into this pizza place again.",0.9965,0.744,0.232,0.024,0.5294057794057795

I fished through the sea of whipped cream and hit the bottom of the pan.  As I poked my spoon around more, I heard more tapping with no resistance where cookie should be.  This was like a whipped cream pie with a cookie like crust, certainly no cookie of respectable thickness.  It was like they took ONE break and bake cookie from the store, rolled it thin then covered it with whipped cream and a puny scoop of ice cream hoping you wouldn't notice.  The amount of cookie we both ate in eating half of each 'deep dish' was like eating one small, disappointing cookie.  To top it off, it was $18 with modest tip for this heap of fail.   Talk about a 180 in the wrong direction, won't be coming back.",0.6289,0.807,0.115,0.078,0.4530423280423281

Pizano's spent ages trying to figure out who came first and how many people make up the parties before seating anyone. Pizano's waiter was absolutely awkward, made rude comments, and messed up our check, as well as the table next to us, THREE times. He also wrote our order on a used napkin.  The deep-dish pizza: Hands down, the best deep dish I have ever had was at Lou Malnati's. Pizano's deep dish was horrendous. The crust was too thick and crispy. I could not cut into it at all. It tasted awful. The cheese tasted like it was not fresh at all, and the tomato sauce on top tasted like it was fresh from the can- it had an awful and bitter aftertaste. My pizza was overcooked. Lou Malnati's is the best, by far, for delivery, service, and quality of their pizza. Pizano's is a sinking ship.",0.0027,0.731,0.135,0.134,0.5563492063492064

We ordered almost the same same thing at both places (appetizer, pizza, and drinks)  and not only is the quality better at Pizano, we spent $20 less.  Easy choice- go to Pizano!",0.9752,0.778,0.203,0.019,0.5064892623716153

I can't really complain about it, because it tasted fine, but it just does not compare to some of the other options available. The reason I gave Pizano's two stars is because of the truly awful service. I came here with some of my friends on a Tuesday night, and most of the employees were plain rude and short with us whenever we asked any questions and when we were ordering. Somehow, they were out of two of their tap beers and out of lemonade (really?), so we were forced to choose other beverages. This didn't really bother us, but it gives you an idea of their disorganized atmosphere. What really cemented Pizano's as a bad experience was when we got our bill. There were four of us dining, and we split the bill between two of us. When we got our cards back, we noticed that the waitress had filled in the tip and total amounts on each receipt, giving herself an 18% tip. I pretty much always tip 20%, so I actually saved money, but it was pretty insulting that she didn't allow us to decide for ourselves (especially since the service was bad..). Bewildered, we showed the receipt to another host, asking if this was policy, he simply stated ""No that isn't policy, I've never seen that happen before"" without offering any sort of solution. We couldn't find a manager and it was late, so we ended up leaving. Save yourself some frustration and get deep dish somewhere else.",0.3348,0.772,0.12,0.109,0.4949206349206349

2014-08-14,1.0,"I USED to be Pizano's biggest advocate. Until the server who refers to himself as ""The Chach"" gave us the worst service, you would have thought we were at Ed Debevic's or Dick's Last Resort. Prior to this terrible experience, I told everyone I knew about how great it was, and took many different people there when they would be in Chicago. I even convinced someone to go back there after a bad experience because I loved the place. I'm a student, and they have the student nights on Tuesdays after 9pm where you get free pizza, but you must pay for a drink and gratuity. Regardless of this deal, we went in even when there were no deals, and some of the servers know us. We went in a little over two weeks ago on a Tuesday, and we had ""The Chach"" as our server for the first time. We told him we were there for student night, and he rudely demanded to see our Student IDs. Fair enough, even though we had been going in for the deal for about a year and never had to show them. We didn't have them. He rudely tried to convince us that he was giving us a break this time, but to not let it happen again. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip right away because we were really hungry. We were going to give him our drink order, but he demanded we give him the food order first. We told him we wanted a deep dish. He interrupted, ""You only get a small"" in a rude, manor. Fair enough dude, this wasn't our first rodeo. 10-15 minutes later, our drinks come. Meanwhile this man is socializing for 10-15 minutes with his other tables, and I saw he still had yet to put in our order. The spinach dip comes out, it was pretty good, we had had it before. 45 minutes later, among empty glasses that needed a refill for probably 25 minutes, which he quickly told us we only get one refill, our pizza comes out. It was the small deep dish we ordered.  Our server then proceeded to yell at the man who brought us our pizza, and forced him to take the pizza away. We told the man who brought the pizza that it was the right one! Yet our server demanded he take it away, and then was no where to be found. Another 30 minutes later, our server said, ""sorry, he brought out the wrong one. No big deal."" Well sir, it is a big deal. We didn't have all night to sit there waiting for a pizza. Finally, another pizza was brought to our table. WHICH WAS THIN CRUST! Are you serious? We then waited another 5-10 minutes and received our pizza which tasted and looked like it had been sitting out. It wasn't even hot. Pretty sure it was the pizza we originally wanted that our server demanded the food runner take away; I don't care if it was free pizza, I would pay full price for it to be at least good and receive good service. Our server came around after we were almost done and told us he would buy us dessert. Well it was already late at this point, so we told him we were okay. Our bill comes in which our server put 20% gratuity on.... For the worst service I have ever received in my life. I jokingly said, well since we didn't take you up on the dessert I thought you would take care of our app. He said, ""I'm not taking off your app, I work for a living."" HA! Forget it. Hate to say it, because I used to love this place, but I probably won't even be returning here for free pizza unless ""The Chach"" is fired.",-0.8937,0.784,0.099,0.117,0.5771825396825397

The only thing really going for it was that the restaurant is in a convenient location for those times that you happen to be in The Loop, such as after a visit to Millenium Park or the Art Institute.

However, if you take a peak downstairs, there's an even larger dining room provided as well. Our large group was seated downstairs, which was which was pleasantly a good experience. The ambiance felt private enough that we weren't overhearing other tables. We ended up ordering chicken fingers and three pizzas: one deep dish, one combo with sausage, and one plan cheese. Each of the meals were very hot and tasted fine. The cleanliness of the place is a bit lackluster. Given that it's a loop Chicago restaurant open at 10, I understand that it could get a little grungy at that time but still, the bathrooms shouldn't be as atrocious as they were.

2014-08-11,4.0,"It is Saturday night. The crew from the sailboat is rough and gruff after the second day of the regatta. It is a tough life being on the waters of Lake Michigan in perfect weather with a great breeze and circling the race course like rock stars (this is a review not a reach out for pity so internalize your grumblings about how not-rough my life is please because I actually agree with you). After a few rum and ginger beer drinks, we realize we are actually getting hungry. Someone mentions Pizano's. We call and they are not taking any more reservations for the evening but we are welcome to stop by and put our names in the old-fashioned way (quaint I know). I retire my OpenTable app for the evening and start walking the half mile over to get our names in with a fellow crew member. There are ten of us and we figure it will be awhile. Side note - Do not try to keep up with Byron when one is wearing flip flops because he power walks pretty darn fast. I scrunched my toes so hard trying to keep the flip flops on while walking fast I actually had muscle burn in the front part of my legs. You know...that burn you get in your biceps when you are curling more than you should for longer than you should because you are trying to impress someone cute at the gym? Yes that type of burn. By the time the rough and gruff (and slightly obnoxiously inebriated) crew gets there ten minutes later, we actually end up waiting just another five minutes. We are happy. It was tight seating but no fault of the restaurant...we got seated...quickly. Kudos to the hosting staff for keeping traffic moving and meeting the barrage of special requests that come with the job. I am venturing a guess keeping air traffic at O'Hare straight on Thanksgiving eve is an easier traffic control job.  Clearly our server has helped sailors before because our drink orders are PROMPTLY taken. The number rule of keeping a weary sailor happy...bring beverage. We are appeased and, after much debate about the merit of black olives and understanding who is vehemently opposed to fungus, we settle upon the typical meat lovers (sausage and pepperoni), one with a ton of veggies and the special needs pizza that has the stuff no one can agree on - you know...mushroom, jalapenos, a few other items for good measure. To spite the mushroom haters we actually ordered the portabella appetizer. The appetizer was pretty much a portabella mushroom. On a plate. Marinated. Probably grilled? Okay my judgment was probably being hampered a bit by all that walking with flip flops. I remember it was ""not bad"". A bit juicy.  The pizzas arrived and I have to admit, there were some mixed reviews. There are two rules in life. Do not get in a two-front war in Asia and you will never appease everyone when it comes to a single pizza. That was the exact dynamic we saw at the table. However, the toppings were respectable and not noticeably out of a can so I assume they were not, the pizza actually had some crust to it (someone said there was some relation to Lou Malnetti's...something about someone knows / dated / is related / hung out with Lou Malnetti...I checked snopes and could not verify that but I did not see similarity in the crust). I definitely would go back if I am in the area and craving pizza.  So onward and upward. I give this place four stars for my first visit. The food was respectable. More importantly the staff were GREAT! You see...when we get it in our head we want to do something on the boat...that is the only thing we can focus on.

2014-08-01,4.0,"Pizano's Pizza has been a Chicago pizza institution since 1991 when Rudi Malnati Jr. opened his first pizza shop. It is no surprise that Pizano's is very famous. Rudi Malnati learned from one of the best pizza chefs: his dad Rudy Malnati Sr. He is the founder of Pizzaria Uno that opened way back in 1943. No wonder that their restaurants are filled to capacity and widely acclaimed. According to the Pizano's website, USA Today voted their thin crust pizza as one of the Top 10 in the USA and Oprah Winfrey voted it as her favorite thin crust pizza. I assume that if Oprah was a yelper she'd vote it 5 stars. Based on my experience I am rating it 4 stars. Here is my Pizano's experience.    I have tried Gino's East and Giordano's. They were good at the same time I thought they were overrated. Back in 2012, we tried the State Street Pizano's. It was 4 star delicious. Fast forward two years, when we returned to Chicago we saw the Madison Street Pizano's. We'd give it a try.   Pizano's is located on Madison Street between Wabash Avenue and Michigan Avenue at the eastern border of the Loop. It is in the heart of the city. When you sit outside or wait outside, you get to take in the rhythm of the city. When you look up you see the elevated train buzzing above Wabash Avenue and the architecture of the skyscrapers. At eye level pedestrians and cars pass by on Madison Street. What makes this an interesting spot is that if I am not mistaken Madison Street is the diving line between north and south Chicago. So much for facts, lets step inside Pizano's.     When we stepped inside Pizano's there was very little space to step. The same reason that Oprah rated their pizza high and that USA Today rated it one of the ten best thin crust pizzas in America (according to their website) is why there was a wait and that it was busy. When I write busy I state that every table was taken and people were standing waiting by the tables. This is a compliment to the business taking into account that the restaurant is two floors.    Waiting was not so bad. The hostess handed us a beeper that gave us freedom to walk around. In the dimly lit restaurant, I looked at the pictures of all the celebrities who supposedly dined here. Just like the State Street Pizano's, the walls are covered with pictures. Most of the time waiting was standing outside on the Madison Street sidewalk taking in the scenery.   Back inside, the waitress was pleasant but very busy. We ordered a large pizza with BBQ chicken. As we waited, I read their story on the history of pizza and Pizano's.    The thin crust pizza was delicious. The cheese was mouth watering and plentiful. The pizza sauce was delicious. And the crust was just right. In similar style to Chicago pizzarias they cut the pie into squares. My minor complaint with Pizano's and the competition is that they need to offer individual pies. I love my family but when we share a large pizza pie we seem to compete for the slices. Maybe its just me. The thing is the pizza is so out of this world that we'd each finish a slice, grab the next, and eventually the pie was gone. But not the memory.    Pizano's Pizza is a Chicago pizza institution that lives up to its name. And without fail, Pizano's Pizza lives up to my four star expectation.",0.9903,0.901,0.085,0.014,0.465092322643343

Yes, they have a pizookie dessert...it's amazing.  But then again, every pizookie is amazing.   I can sum up my love for Pizano's in one sentence...my brother organized my bachelor party and we went to Pizano's for dinner.",0.9944,0.728,0.264,0.008,0.6697368421052632

After the fifth time I would think the problem would be addressed. With an hour quickly approaching we asked to speak to the manager...

The dough/breading was thick, crunchy and flavorful too, holding the slices together very well.

As the pizza cools, the cheese started solidifying and lost it's chewy texture. The service however was not good at all. We stood around for a bit in the front of the restaurant looking for the hostess. The server only refilled our water once. When the pizza came out they forgot the plates.  The garlic bread appetizer came with marinara sauce, and both were excellent. Not too strong of a garlic taste but of flavor.  If I do ever come back, I'm planning on getting the thin crust.

I must say both crusts were amazing... Buttery crispy but with substance. Really hard to describe! Just amazing. The sauce tasted homemade and unadulterated, with a nice pleasing zing.  As if a perfect crust holding a well-balanced, chunky homemade sauce wasn't enough, I was further smitten by the generous loads of fresh toppings. I usually consider myself a thin crust girl. That's because I associate deep dish with a ridiculously heavy, gloopy, greasy cheese fest. And the deep dish is nothing like that. Yes, it's rich, but they've successfully created a pie that is also well-balanced in flavor texture and indulgence.  My ability to enjoy wine with it is a reflection of this deep dish's conservative richness.  The bar's offering of Kim Crawford Sav Blanc (my favorite go-to for a crisp, refreshing, uncomplicated white wine) was a pleasant surprise!

2014-03-18,5.0,"I came here for a late lunch on a Friday after touring around the Loop most of the morning.  No tables available, so I took a seat at the bar. My mission: try Chicago-style pizza for the first time. Everywhere I have lived in this great country looks down on Chicago's pizza - it's too thick, it's not healthy - New York's large thin slices are the only ones people want to eat.  So while I was in the city, I was determined to see for myself what all the fuss was about in Chicago.  After I spotted a pizza being delivered to a nearby table, I checked the menu - luckily they offered individual size pizzas for about $7 each. I ordered one of Mark's specials, which comes with tomato, basil and garlic.  The bartender warned me it could take a while, so I ordered a salad while I waited. Their house dressing was good, a kind of tomato-tangy Italian. I had a bottle of beer and tried to chat with the Blackhawks fans sitting next to me.  They weren't too eager to converse with a girl from Nashville. As I looked around the bar, I realized there were a TON of red hockey jerseys. So maybe it's not a tourist joint?  (Predators won later that night, 4-3.  Bet that place was a riot.) Pizza finally arrived - after leaning in for a deep whiff, I thought I had died and gone to roasted tomato heaven. I was expecting a greasy crust based on my deep dish experience with Jets, but the bottom of the crust was dry. With a slightly crispy bottom, and a thick, soft crust, the sauce and the cheese were layered on top. That cheese was the real mozzarella deal. The tomatoes were amazing. And oh, the garlic. I ate every bit of that damn pizza and wished for more. I wandered around in a cloud of carbs the rest of the day. Where, oh where will I find pizza like that in Nashville?  I'm already planning my next trip to Chicago.  Bartender was very kind and checked in on me several times. We chatted about Nashville a while, I think she is considering a move here. If she can make pizza like that, she has a room waiting at my house.",0.9474,0.888,0.078,0.033,0.4678040913335031

I ended up ordering cheesy garlic bread and a small sausage and pepperoni deep dish pizza. The cheesy garlic bread looked amazing and very cheesy!!! It tasted just as good. I was a bit skeptical about the pizza as it honestly did not look that great. However, upon first bite I was quickly proven wrong. It was a very good pizza!!! It offered the perfect balance of cheese and meat toppings and the crust was cooked to perfection.  The only con I can see about Pizano's is the price. It was about $30 for a small pizza and cheesy bread. I did get two meals out of it though and didn't even eat all of the garlic bread. So in that regard I guess it is not that bad.

I said no pinenuts on one of the pastas and the manager actually called me to let me know they were in the sauce in case I was allergic! Talk about going above and beyond. In addition, we had selected marinara with the cheese sticks and were surprised it was an additional $2.50. He gave us a heads-up that the cheese sticks already come with marinara and the $2.50 was for an additional 8oz side. Since we didn't really need it, but had already paid for it, he let us switch it out for other smaller sides of sauce such as ranch, honey mustard, etc. The total was actually more than $2.50, but he let it slide cause apparently that's just the level of service here- impecable!

No  While the pizza wasn't awful, it certainly wasn't in my top 3 in all of Chicago. However, their thin crust was better than their deep dish. Yes, my dining companion and I ordered two medium sized pizzas; even the waiter gave us a look of concern. He was so concerned that he moved us from the tiny two person table next to two people on a date to a four person. Their sausage is good, but the crust for the deep dish had a weird taste and fell apart at the slightest touch.   Whereas many reviews complained about the service, ours wasn't bad. It got off to a slow start, but he rallied and checked on us throughout the night. The taste of the pizza certainly effects your judgement about it, but so does price. I'm willing to pay more for great taste, but not for average to below average compared to other pizza places....Pequods, Piece, Roots and even Lou's can justify charging more, but not Pizanos.

Ordered a medium deep dish sausage and a medium thin crust with pepperoni and green peppers. Both were good, but quite didn't live up to the hype, especially the thin crust. Certainly doesn't justify the outrageous prices either. There are pizzareias in Chicago such as Pequods and Uno's/Due's that offer a better deep dish and a better price. I am also baffled that you have to have a minimum check of $20 to pay with plastic. Wouldn't be a good option for lunch if you don't carry cash. I will say I was very pleased with the service. Our waiter was very prompt and accomodating. Because we ordered two pizzas, he moved us to a bigger table, which also was at the window and out of the middle of the dining room and he comped us a free dessert and soft drink.

Expecting it to be busy on a Saturday night I made a reservation even though the hostess said one wouldn't be necessary.  I also pre-ordered the pizza to have it ready at 6 p.m, the time of our reservation.  We arrived on time and were told there was a slight wait...... not a problem. Unfortunately, we were not seated until 6:30.  At this point the pizza was no longer was no longer fresh out of the oven and was actually cold.  The hostess tried to compensate us by sending over ice cream, but guess what we didn't come here to eat a crappy sundae.  I made a reservation for 2 after being told I didn't need one, why would you seat us at 6:30 and expect people to come back?  I understand restaurants have to deal with multiple variables, but why not offer us a drink at the bar while we were waiting to smooth things over immediately rather than agitate us. The next day I reheated the pizza is was great! We had a great waiter, but in a competitive pizza town like Chicago keeping customers coming back with service is essential.  There is a reason Lou Malnati's is blowing Pizanos out of the water.

Well, the deep dish pizza turned out to be highly disappointing.  While it was super cheesy, the pepperoni on top wasn't even remotely crisp.  The crust wasn't flaky or crisp - Just kind of in the middle as a regular dough.  Overall, the pizza wasn't even that flavorful.

The first time we found Pizano's, we were at Millenium or Grant Park for an event.  Hubby headed over and ordered food to bring back to the family.  Was a nice experience. The second time, hubby and I ate out on patio on a beautiful day- so nothing was going to ruin the experience. This last time, it was after a busy day exploring the city on the Divvy bikes.  we were tired and hungry, and thought we were getting to the restaurant before the crowd- about 6 pm...guess we were wrong! The place was pretty busy. No seating left on patio, so we went in to wait for a table.  Since there is no foyer, you are literally standing in the doorway while you wait. There were a few tables open in the bar area, but when the hostess finally got around to seating us, she almost wasn't going to let us sit there, as one was a table for 4, and we were only 2 people. Once we were seated, our waitress was attentive. We ordered drinks, then when they arrived, ordered our pizza and salads. Hubby's salad was very watery at the bottom of the lettuce- so it diluted his dressing.  The blue cheese dressing, he said, was ""different""...with a dill taste to it.  I wasn't too impressed with the pizza.  We love thin crust- but this was so crispy/crunchy that it was't enjoyable to eat.  It tasted fine, but i felt the ingredients were skimpier than we're used to on our pizzas.  (I'm a Nancy's Pizza fan!)  Had orderd green olives, but my first 2 pieces only had one olive on each piece. Saw a few people come in with kids (one in a stroller)...ther was just NO ROOM for an umbrella stroller in that place...that poor little girl nearly got trampled with the traffic trying to squeeze past her.

We arrived just before 6:30 on a Friday night with a party of 7.  It was a humid evening but there was little relief from the heat inside, it felt like they didn't have the AC on.  I even mentioned it to the hostess and she was like, ""Yeah I know.  It does seem warm in here doesn't it?""  She just kept manning her post, didn't even check the thermostat or send someone else to.  It was slightly more comfortable inside than out so dining on their patio was out of the question.  I put our name in for a table and the hostess gave me a ballpark estimate on the wait and a pager.  When that estimated time ended I asked again because my pager didn't go off.  They really have no clue about how to guesstimating table wait time.  Our initial 20 minutes was in reality 50, but every time I asked I got the ""Oh it'll just be 10 minutes.""  Add to it the heat and the fact that they don't have a designated waiting area inside unless you belly up to the bar, which was fairly busy and we had small children.  My brother managed to finish two cocktails and I downed 2 large glasses of water...all while standing just inside the door for FIFTY minutes.  I had to bite my cheek every time the words ""biatch bring me a chair"" started to form on my tongue. We were finally seated at a very small table cramped in the corner surrounded by other full tables.  The service was fine, our drinks and complimentary bread came out quickly.  We placed our order right away after sitting: a Rudy's Special deep dish, regular crust cheese pizza and a chop salad to share.  The Rudy's Special was a basic sausage, mushroom, onion and green pepper deal.  The deep dish pizza came out after about 40 minutes after placing the order.  It wasn't overly cheesy, the crust wasn't super thick either, the other toppings were pretty good and the sauce was a little bland.  All in all a slice couldn't have been more than 1/2"" tall...I like my deep dish DEEP and full of toppings, sauce and more cheese than this one had.  Overall, it was a let down that I would try again. From the hostess and the standing wait to the cramped tables, the cherry on top for the night was that I forgot my credit card in the bill folder.  I called 20 minutes after I left to see if they had it.  They never called me back, GREAT customer service...SMH.",0.995,0.852,0.132,0.016,0.45357350687137915

I ordered an individual-sized mushroom and sausage pizza, and only had to wait five minutes between walking in the door and getting my food.  The cheese was gooey and the sauce reminded me of my dad's homemade sauce, so that automatically stuck out to me. The mushrooms were good and the sausage had a great flavor.

The tomatoes are fresh, the basil is strong and off the charts, and the bread is fresh. I also had the complimentary bread brought to the table, and being a bread fiend, it was great bread. My associate ordered the deep dish pizza and let me tell you, the mozzarella stretched and stretched and stretched and she was finally able to break it off at some point. I tried a piece of the deep dish and now know what I'm missing out on. It's sad that I only made it here once and didn't order the deep dish pizza and promise to come back whenever I'm in Chicago again. I ordered the lemon chicken, it was bomb. The breading on the chicken didn't taste like breading. It was a crisp crust and wasn't heavily oily, and I wanted to know how they could get such a crispy (breaded) crust on the chicken and have the chicken fully cooked and not greasy? It's modern wonder :)  The chicken is fresh. It didn't have that funky after taste one usually can get when a chicken was killed more than 2 years ago and probably left out for 3 days before it was frozen, unfrozen somewhere along the line, and refrozen....anyway.... the lemon sauce was excellent too, I could taste the capers and the lemon sauce.

If you'd like to join the petition for a class action lawsuit foe ruining evenings when you're looking forward to a nice warm pizza, Pls plus this rating. The tomato sauce is devoid of flavor, as Is the cheese and flour. The flour tastes like a mix between corn flour, chalk and paste. The cheese, if we can deem this gift from the Cow as such on this culinary travesty, is void of flavor or the right texture. So poor is its quality, when you cut it doesn't pull apart in a melty, gooey deliciousness..

Most deep dish pizzas are over stuffed, but Pizano's gets it with the right amount of cheese, sauce, and toppings. The winner, however, is the thin crust. Buttery crispy crust where the toppings are covered under the cheese is a pure delight. The only drawback of this thin crust is that it doesn't hold well for delivery. But it beats most thin crust pizza in town when eaten on site. The salads are big and green (well, how else do you describe a salad?).

I decided to order the vegetarian deep dish pizza, which had your usual pizza veggies on top. The pizza took the normal 20-30 minutes to cook, and once the waiter brought the pizza out, I knew it was time to rock! This was a pretty hefty sized pizza (Medium), and I knew my stomach was about to get rocked. First of all, the crust was amazing. Just that perfect amount of crunch, with a nice hint of butter inside. Toppings were just as I expected, with the cheese complimenting it in an amazing fashion. The pizza dough wasn't too mealy either. As far as the pizza sauce goes, it was good, but not among the best ones that I've tasted. Nonetheless, a pretty solid pizza. Pizano's, I'll probably come back to you if I stay around the Loop again. You didn't let me down, and was able to give me a solid lunch. The Loop doesn't have many options to choose from, so this is a nice sight to see in the area.",0.9923,0.792,0.167,0.042,0.5870870870870872

I am pleased to say that Pizano's pizza is one of the better places.    Every time I go there, the service is prompt, attentive, and friendly. You may run into a waiter named ""The Chach"" and he's super friendly and definitely creates an alluring atmosphere. I unfortunately wasn't served by The Chach last night, but it was just as prompt, attentive and friendly as always.  The Spinach and Artichoke dip is as much of a staple as the pizza is. Very highly recommended. IT comes with toasted bruschetta bread and never disappoints. Just be careful - if you don't let it cool for a minute you might burn your mouth! Of course the Pizza is delicious. I always get the deep dish pepperoni. Sometimes my girlfriend insists on putting pineapples in it. I'm not a giant fan of that, but that's certainly not Pizano's fault! Hah.  It's cheesy (but not TOO cheesy) with a butter crust - just the way I like it. The waiter actually comped our dessert too which was a nice surprise. It was a giant cookie with ice cream and whipped cream. It was delicious and filling, but my waistline tends to think unfavorably about my decision to eat it. I still stand by my decision.   It tends to run a little bit on the pricier side compared to other pizza places. But you know what? You get what you pay for and I've never been disappointed with Pizano's product.

NEVER AGAIN will we order from Pizano's.  One would think for $20.00 (yes $20.00--delivery and tip made it $28.00) for a thin crust pizza, it should have been over the top.  Well my wife and I were so disappointed.  We are not ""competitors"" -- just a couple who love pizza..especially before the Presidential Debates. We love good pizza--both thick and thin.  We LOVE deep dish from Lou Malnati's and Bacino's, thin crust from La Gondola--but we read that Pizano's was the #1 Best Pizza in Chicago and decided to give it a try.  Forget it.    If I were the owner I would be totally embarrassed to put out such an inferior thin crust pizza.  Sorry, Pizano's, you are off our list--a very bad first time experience.  And there is never going to be a second time for certain.",-0.9605,0.752,0.088,0.16,0.6280632984901281

The crust here is thoroughly unenjoyable: dry, hard, sharp, and covered in corn meal. I've actually cut my mouth on this pizza crust before.

2012-09-25,1.0,"We hosted our rehearsal dinner here.  We booked a pizza/salad/beer/wine package and were happy to have everything included and this checked off the worry list.  They were accommodating about adding in our preferred dessert, Tiramisu.  When we arrived, it was mass confusion.  We had the whole half of the downstairs dining room (no one was in the other half), minus one table in the corner, where a group of strangers were seated.  We literally sat on three sides of them and it was awkward to have them there amongst our family and friends.  We were told to go ahead and get drinks at the bar or waiters would come to the tables to bring out drinks.  We had five extra guests, which happened to be the bride, groom, groom's elderly parents and his sister, who had arrived last.  They arrived and had NO WHERE to sit.  Disaster.  Granted there WAS an open table, in the other half of the room, but they wouldn't allow us to sit there because it was booked, though the party was already 75 minutes past the reservation time.  After some frantic scrambling between waiters/management, the guests of honor were allowed to be seated, as were the elderly in-laws. So we were seated, though not with the rest of our family (like outcasts at our own party) - (granted this mistake was initially our fault, but it was not handled well and if the stranger table wasn't there, it wouldn't have been an issue at all - we integrated with the group by moving to that table after those diners left). Dinner was served and I found it mediocre, though others seemed to enjoy it (maybe just being nice?) - Chicago has better salad and pizza options than this, for sure, but it served the purpose.  But the basis of my rating is that when we went to pay the bill (bride/groom hosted), we were struck by a higher than anticipated bill because they had opened up a bar tab and guests had racked up about $200 of non-beer/wine drinks.  We booked a complete package and believed that that's what we would pay for.  Not once did anyone in the booking process ever mention how we wanted to handle if guests want something which was not included. In my experience, the wait staff will inform guests what's included and direct them to a cash bar if they want something else.  Maybe that's not always how it's done, but opening up an unauthorized bar tab is a sneaky business practice.  The waiter gave me the name of the manager and told me to call him the next day.  I made many calls after the wedding and felt the situation was handled very unprofessionally.  We had a $1500 tab and they engaged in unfair business practice in my opinion and all they would offer was a $75 gift certificate.   $200 isn't a huge deal, but it's the principal that angers me so. In the scope of their business, is $200 really worth an angry customer and nasty review (and BBB complaint, which they never responded to, though they had all the information necessary to respond respectfully)? Apparently they believe so. This was, at best, unclear communication on their part (and lack of a written contract).  They've lost my business and my recommendation.  I hope other party-hosters take note of my experience.",-0.9249,0.819,0.077,0.105,0.48325825825825836

First impression of Pizano's upon walking in was that it was dark and but they had a bunch of TV's tuned to various games and I couldn't help but notice the red & white checkered tablecloth that runs standard with the old school Italian restaurants, which I was able to overlook as the food certainly made up for it. We started off with their Bottoms Up Chicken Wings, with medium heat, which essentially made them Buffalo Wings.  The wings were pretty decent, the sauce was nicely dressed and the flavoring was infused skin deep.  The wings also had a nice crisp factor to it, which tells me the wings were freshly fried and not just popped into the oven.  The s/o and I also shared a Caesar Salad, which was standard but the dressing was flavorful and had nice hints of garlic.  Now for the pizza. Pizano's would be the very first spot I'd get to try some real Chicago style pizza.  With that said, my expectation were so high, that it had to knock my socks and shoes off.  Our server did forewarn us that it would take around 30-minutes or so to bake, which just simply built up the anticipation.  We ordered a small Rudy's Special.  Between the s/o and I, we can easily eat an average of four slices of thin crust easily, but our server suggested a small would be sufficient and it was.  When our pizza came out, it was pure, melted cheese and pizza topping perfection!  I grabbed a slice of that bad boy, took my first bite and it was amazing.  The toppings were fresh, the cheese was fresh and the pie/crust was out of this world!  Not sure what's in their dough recipe but my biggest pet peeve is when my pizza slice becomes soggy and (excuse the expression) limp. The service was meh, but I didn't expect to exactly be wowed since it was so late in the evening.  But our beves were refilled when we needed it, our food came out as expected and got our check when requested. Overall, if I had to recollect where I had the best pizza I had during my visit to Chicago, Pizano's was pretty damn good but Lou Malnati's reigned at number one, Giordano's in last place.  With that said, Pizano's is definitely worth checking out!",0.9968,0.8,0.169,0.031,0.48623689727463315

Turns out every Tuesday night (starting at 9pm) you can get free pizza! You just have to pay for a drink and then gratuity is included on the bill. But no matter how many people I came with, our totals always ended up being about $5 each. That's a pretty stellar price for some of the best pizza in the city!  It's a really cute place too.

It tastes a little like beer, which is a plus in my book. On this most recent trip, we ordered the thin crust with spinach and garlic. My partner enjoys thin crust, I enjoy pan, but at Pizano's everybody wins because their thin crust still satisfies a pan-lover with crunch and flavor.  Everyone must try Pizano's for the delicious pizza, but must also know the service is not going to be wonderful. It will likely be lackluster. We recently waited five minutes after our salad arrived for utensils, we waited 15 minutes after eating for a visit from our server to request the bill. I'm surprised that the servers aren't faster here, since they are always busy and likely should be flipping tables as quickly as possible.

We ordered it 30 minutes before we were ready for it to give them enough time and after we were done eating and had been waiting for a good 10-15 minutes, were told that the ""manager is informing"" the waiters that ""they're no longer making dessert because there are too many pizzas in line.""  Um... are you kidding me? I'm sorry, but this restaurant isn't a new restaurant. It's been around for ages so shouldn't they know how to handle a big crowd and still be able to serve their desserts for goodness sake? The line wasn't that long either, I would say it was about 30-45 minute wait. I think we were more disappointed than anything because we were so looking forward to one of their famous dishes. Who can say no to dessert??? Apparently we had to that night.",0.967,0.839,0.114,0.047,0.5587743506493507
2011-08-21,1.0,"I signed up for yelp just for this review. I normally hate when people post things about restaurants that are not about the food but this situation I really felt needed to be pointed out.  My friend and I found Pizano's by accident and quickly got in line for a table once we saw how crowded the place was (I always try to follow the people when it comes to food.). Anyway, fast forward hour and half my friend and I are seated finishing our meal (we ordered a thin crust brickhouse pizza) we are squashed between two other tables. As we were getting up to leave, the table next to us (two people) stopped us to ask about a msg that had been written at the top of their bill.  Suggested tip: $9.00 Thank you! Was their waiter REALLY ""suggesting"" a tip from them for a certain amount? I quickly showed the couple my tab when they asked if the same had been put on my bill (it hadn't). I had also seen the couple's bill and a 9.00 tip would have been extremely gracious (for service, food, and ambiance that didn't warrant it). Now why was it there? I don't know. Was it because their server thought they were foreign? Maybe (although I find this extremely ignorant since they both spoke English). Was it because of their ethnicity? I don't know.  Who cares? It shouldn't have been done. I was appalled and offended for them. I had been sitting beside that couple since they sat down; their waiter was not all that.  My entire view of Pizano's soured after that. Food that was ""pretty okay"" has quickly turned into ""meh"". And I won't be returning.",0.8745,0.826,0.098,0.075,0.4844576719576719

I called the restaurant to make sure they were still doing the promotion and was told that we at least have to purchase a drink to get the free pizza; I was totally fine with that.     My friends and I got there around like 11pm and went in to get a table. We were told it was going to be a few minuted before they could seat us...perfectly acceptable. So we took the pager and walked outside to wait in the nice cool air. The pager goes off about 25 minutes later and so we all walk it. The hostess said that she would be splitting us up into 2 separate tables...on opposite sides of the restaurant. I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT WOULD EVEN PASS THROUGH A HOSTESS' MIND!? I mean honestly, when is that acceptable to offer  a group to sit apart from each other? I am totally fine with waiting for a larger table to open up. And so we declined and walked back outside to wait.      Another 25 minutes passes and we finally get in and sit down at a rather tight squeeze of a table in the corner of the restaurant by the bar, where all the noisy sports watchers are (and there was a hockey game on that everyone was literally screaming about). Whatever.     Our waitress comes and takes our drink orders, after a few minutes she comes back with them and we ask about the free college student pizza. Since there was 7 of us, we were allowed 2 large pizza, so we ordered a large deep dish with pepperoni, sausage, and olives, and also a large thin crust pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms. We are told there was going to be a half hour wait for the pizzas, totally fine.     About 10 minutes later we are through our sodas and ask for a refill, the waitress tells us we are only allowed one refill. WTF!!! I've never in the world been to a restaurant where only one refill was given, especially when a soda is $2.50! My friends and I could not believe that, and the waitress ignored our shocked faces (I bet she's used to the shocked faces on college nights).     Not only that, but we later learned that we were being charged 18% gratuity...not only on our drinks, but on the pizzas!! That means we were being taxed and gratuity on about $78!!! If we would have known that we would not have even went. We spend about $30...on free college night???    Our pizzas come, we're already pretty upset with the place. Three of us are sharing the deep dish, and so we wanted to put it by us...however, we didn't know which one was deep dish. I know deep dish, trust me, I love it. What was in that black pan was not deep! It looked exactly like the thin crust pizza, except that the crust was just a tad taller on the edge. The pizza tasted gross, and I pretty much figured the cooks just didn't care about the quality because it was for free. My friends and I were pissed.    Pizano's will never get my money again.

2011-03-06,5.0,"One of the first things I learned within my first minutes in Chicago is, like in New York City, asking people where the best pizzeria in Chicago is is a bad idea. Depending on who you ask, reactions can range from frenetic to offensive, neither of which are welcoming to first-time visitors. Instead, I chose to play Yelp roulette and amongst the many selections I had, I settled on Pizano's at Madison.  Considering how I exclusively stop here during every visit in Chicago, it looks like I won that round. For anyone that's been to a respectable brick-oven pizzeria, the interior is familiar: Pizano's sets the setting to an old-fashioned, but comfortably-classy Italian-American restaurant and succeeds. Most of the wait staff are friendly and approachable, and both the food and drink selections are vast enough to satisfy anyone's calling for the night. Some here have complained of poor service in the past, particularly at this location, but other than long wait times for my pizzas (which is expected; great pizza never comes out quick), I've never experienced this in my three visits here to date. Nonetheless, I don't visit this place for the decor, I visit it for it's crown jewel: the pie. I'll make a dirty confession here: I've yet to try any other authentic Chicago deep-dish pizza. Thus, I can't compare it to any of the other highly-regarded shops around, though it would still be a bit of a personal taste even if I did. Perhaps this is the experiences of my times at Grimaldi's and Lombardi's here in NYC talking, but *this pizza is supreme, hands down.* The sauce is balanced and un-overwhelming, which is somewhat deceiving given the amount of sauce I saw on the pizzas I've ordered. When combined with the fresh and chewy mozzarella, it melts in the mouth while exploding with deliciousness. The already-perfect slice is beautifully complimented with a thick and crunchy crust that has a fine note of flavor and a satisfying aftertaste.  If the chefs behind Grimaldi's, Patsy's, Lombardi's and Pizano's created a coalition, it might provide the solution to world peace and nuclear disarmament. Yes, it's that good. At nearly $16 for a small pie, it's a bit pricier than most. Regardless, any pizzeria that makes me travel hundreds of miles to visit is probably worth that ticket.

Individual size deep dish was pretty bad, the sauce was making the pizza wet and soggy, and there were barely any vegetables in there even though I ordered for them to put some in. It was definitely on the list of one of the worse pizza's I've had. My friend had spaghetti which she said she enjoyed.

2011-02-07,2.0,"When it comes to Deep Dish Chicago Pizza, Pizano's isn't what you need to satisfy your palette.  Their pizzas are big, they're average tasting, but their service is lacking and the cheese and sauce combined were much too heavy.   Most recently, the Windy City Pizza Club met there for their monthly meeting, and to many it was disappointing. According to the Oprah Winfrey show, Pizano's has the best thin crust pizzas in the city and one of the top in the nation, and while the Deep Dish was just okay, their thin crust wasn't much better as it has a very ""warmed up in a microwave"" taste.  After hearing so many great reviews from A-List celebrities, and friends, I came to the conclusion that this pizza was not for me.  Their location in the loop was roomy and warm on a snowy and frigid Chicago winter's night, but their presence of service for a group of 15 people was lacking and unacceptable for a place that prides itself of spectacular Chicago pizza. Pizano's was opened in 1991 Rudy Malnati, Junior and features three locations: State Street, Loop, and Glenview, each with it's own unique look and feel.  The loop location where the Pizza Club met was 2 stories with a private room and bar in the roomy basement.  If you were a true Chicago pizza fan, you would know the family that owns this establishment.  Rudy's father, Rudy, Sr. is the founder of Pizzeria Uno & Due.  Rudy Jr.'s, brother is Lou Malnati, founder of Lou Malnati's Pizzeria. According to the Pizano's website, a good raised bread dough tones the crust.  In our experience with the crust, it was extremely hard.  They use High-grade canned tomatoes and of mozzarella cheese, topped with a sprinkling of grated Parmesan and oregano to complete the basic pizza.  It sounded good, but the biggest issue was that they use too much of each item.  The actual wait time for pizza was no longer than 20 minutes, so if you are in a rush and want an average pizza with a lot of history, this is a good place.  Anchovies, onions or green pepper are other optional additions.   I did enjoy a tossed salad, which was fairly large and nicely priced.  All of the prices that Pizano's offers, are out-of-date and expensive for what the quality, but items are large so you could technically say you are getting your money's worth.

I ordered Pizanos because it is close to my office. I actually lived close to the location in Glenview but never tried it.  I got the deep-dish cheese. I was pleasantly surprised. Very good cheese, sauce, and crust combo. One yelper mentioned that Pizanos taste like Lou Mal's but better. I agree that Pizanos is good but the deep-dish is not as thick as Lou's so I like it better but I still like Lou's. I would definitely say that Pizanos is good for people who want deep-dish without all the dough. It has a nice cracker crust on the edge and the cheese is just right.

Oprah likes a lot of things-- being preachy, vaginas, crack, philanthropy-- but that doesn't make it right.  She's right on this, though.  There are two locations in the loop. One near the lake (newer one?) and one on State Street. They're equally tasty. Where people go wrong with Chicago pizza, is that they think it needs to weigh more than a small child. It doesn't. They best thing Pizano's does is thin crust. It's SUPER thin, like a Ritz with cheese, light sauce and your choice of meat.  The pizza comes out scaldingly hot and it pretty much melts in your mouth.  The one near the lake seems more touristy, but the one on State is where it's at. It's got a great 'old-school-mafia' feel to it. You sit in the back, you order your pizza, you get some questionable service from a 20 year old mother of three who'd rather be at her home on south Pulaski with a hair-curler and a Micheal Buble record. That's fine. All you need is pizza.  And you get it here. In spades.  It's hot, it's fresh, it's delicious. Again, it melts in your mouth. You eat and eat and eat and you want more.

2010-03-21,1.0,"Nutshell version: Worst treatment I've ever received at a restaurant Went here with my girlfriend on a Thursday afternoon, maybe around 5pm. We were seated at one of those two-tops where one of you is on a long bench along the wall and the other is in a chair opposite. On either side of you, inches away, is another table, another couple. It's like sitting in one giant booth and I hate it because there's no privacy. Throughout the restaurant there were multiple open tables so after squirming in discomfort for awhile we decided to simply move to a more comfortable spot.. Well, within seconds the host manager (blond woman, didn't get her name) came over and asked really snottily if this was the table we had been seated at. She had just seated us sixty seconds earlier at the original, cramped two-top so I thought the question a bit disingenous. I politely explained that we weren't really comfortable at the original table, and asked if she had an alternative for us. ""Well"" she replied, ""We have a POLICY on Thursday nights that two people can only sit at two tops, so could you return to you original table?""  Feeling slightly embarassed that the manager was making a scene about this, not wanting to be seen as a jackass, and realizing that clearly the table we had moved to (a small 4 top in the corner) was precious to them, I offered to look for a couple places at the bar. ""Fine"" she said and waved us off to the bar. ""Just look around"".  Thanks for your helpfulness. Well, we did look around the bar and couldn't find two adjacent spots at the bar. However, there were MULTIPLE open 3 and 4 tops at the bar--several of which had COUPLES sitting at them. So we sat down at one.  In less the minute, a different hostess who, along with the original host-manager, had obviously been watching us struggle to find a table, came over and immediately started HARASSING us. ""This is a four-top, you can't sit here.""  I was dumbfounded. There were at least 3 open tables in the bar, and NO PATRONS waiting.  ""And why is that?"" I was starting to go over to the dark side.   ""People might get upset"" she explained.  ""What people?"" I asked ""People who might have to wait for a table."" I told her to send her manager to better explain this brilliant policy. The manager came and started in with the same inane nonsense about other customers. ""Where are they?"" ""Well, they're not here yet."" ""So you're more concerned about hypothetical customers who don't exist than the two sitting in front you? Do you see all the open tables with no one waiting?""  ""It's our policy on Thursday nights."" ""IT'S YOUR POLICY TO MAKE PAYING CUSTOMERS SO ANGRY THAT THEY LEAVE, SO YOU CAN FREE UP SPACE FOR IMAGINARY CUSTOMERS?!!""

I think this manager could tell that I was very much on the verge of that moment.  Pizanos gets one star because they forced me to the point of uncivility when all I wanted was some stupid pizza on a Thursday. That should not have to be the most combative thing I do all week.

NOT accomplished... ...but at no fault of Pizano's. Silly me forgot that it was Lent, and good Catholics like myself cannot eat meat on Fridays.  Maybe it's crazy, but I vowed that THIS would be the year I stuck to the ""Vegetarian Friday"" thing, and I wasn't about to abort the mission half way through the season.  I'm not the veggies-on-pizza type and prefer piles of meaty goodness. Thankfully, whoever Mark is created a special on the menu, creatively named ""Mark's Special"", with tomato, basil, and garlic that was not only Lent-friendly but acceptable as well.  Order us up a small deep dish, please!  Thank you, Mark, for keeping me holy.   We threw in an order of spinach/artichoke dip to hold us over during the 45 minute wait for the pizza.  Excellent choice.  It was served with crusty Italian bread as opposed to chips, which stinks, but I guess it IS an Italian restaurant, so I digress. The pizza was pretty much everything I hoped it'd be - piping hot, gooey delicious, and a crunchy buttery crust that is sure to prevent a beach body.  The only thing that disappointments me about their pizza is the lack of thickness of the deep dish crust.  When I think of deep dish, I think of a crust measuring at least 1-2"" top to bottom.  Pizano's is lacking in this area - it's fairly thin and crunchy but models the ""sauce-over-cheese"" model of traditional Chicago deep dish.  If it upped its heftiness I'd be 100% sold on this place. One complaint about the restaurant itself.  We were seated in the very very back left corner of the restaurant.  Right behind my friend's seat was a glass door that led to some hallway, presumably the office or condo building it's attached to.  I would venture to say at least 7 or 8 people walked in and out of that door during the hour and a half we were there, most of them brushing up against or slamming into my friend and/or her chair.  At one point one of the employees did close and lock the door and informed another employee to not allow this, which helped only temporarily, but eventually people continued to come and go as they pleased with no reprimand.  If you dine here, I'd recommend avoiding that table at all costs, even if you have to wait longer.",0.9923,0.784,0.153,0.063,0.5361287477954144

We had been at the Art Institute prior, and I know with it being a stupid holiday that we would probably have a bit of a wait anywhere we went.  Surprisingly, there was a table available in a booth section of the restaurant. This section, however, is terribly cramped and I really don't like being that close to my fellow diners. We opted to wait for a high table separate from the dining room and was told that it would only be 10-15 minutes. In the meantime, we took a seat at the bar to have a beer and watch the Olympics. I have to say, the bartenders aren't terribly friendly. I remember that from my last few visits also.  Twenty minutes later, our buzzer goes off and a table is ready only it's the table that was originally available. When I reminded the hostess we didn't want that table, she just gave me a blank stare and wasn't apologetic. Since we were hungry, we took it instead of watiing for another table. We sat there for several minutes without anyone coming over. Service was incredibly slow and our waitress was nowhere to be found most of the time. She gave me a bit of an attitude when explaining pizza toppings/options to me. I know you're busy, but I don't know the menu, so a little help answering my questions would be great, thanks.  And by the way,  if you don't get a specialty pizza and you want to add toppings, it can get pretty expensive. The pizza, however, is pretty tasty and that's why I give the place two stars.  Definitely delicious, but my stomach is not doing so well today.  Damn the buttery crust!",0.9877,0.812,0.15,0.038,0.4819791666666666

2009-11-14,1.0,"I was ABOUT to give this place three stars - because of the good service the waiter gave me, but the ending with the manager totally turned me off. Please just hear me out. Here's what happened:  I'm at Chicago this weekend since I needed a break from school and needed an escape. Well, I decided to check out Pizano's Pizza & Pasta, because I heard so many good reviews of it. Once seated, I decided to try Chicago's famous deep dish pizza. After a 30 minute wait, the pizza finally came. Upon eating it, it tasted terrible. It had a metallic taste to it, and tasted overcooked. I politely asked the waiter (who has been great through the whole thing, FYI) if he could switch to an fettucine alfredo. No problem. A few minutes later, a bowl of fettucine alfredo arrived. It didn't taste good, either - it had too much cheese and tasted kind of undercooked. I didn't want to complain further, however, so I just ate it. I guess maybe that was a mistake I made, but I was hungry and it was tolerable. Well, when I had finished eating, I asked to see the manager. I wrote him a long note, explaining my gratitude for the waiter bringing me bread and trading the pizza for the pasta (apologizing for the inconvenience, too), and explaining that the pasta didn't taste good at all, and asked him if there was anything he could do for me. He walked off with the bill, then returned shortly with the bill, pointed at it, and shook his head. In hindsight, I should have asked for clarification, but I didn't. Stupid of me. I thought he meant that I didn't have to pay the bill, so I left. Big mistake. As I was walking down the street and turning the corner to return to my hotel, I saw the manager, plus two other men, running after me. My instinct alarmed, and I felt very uncomfortable. They came up near me, in my face, and spoke in my face. I pointed to my ears, to indicate that I am Deaf, and they continued to talk in my face, pointing to the restaurant, and they kept cornering me and wouldn't let me walk away. I felt very scared at that point, and felt trapped, so I just followed them. I kept trying to type on my pager to explain that I thought it was a minunderstanding, but they wouldn't listen or look at my pager, and the three of them basically ""escorted"" me back to the restaurant, walking on my side and behind me. Once inside the restaurant, I tried to catch my breath, and the nice hostess at the front desk gave me a paper and pen. I explained what happened (the minunderstanding and why I left without paying my check), and they still insisted I pay. I decided to pay first (stupidly, but I wasn't thinking straight at that point) and then asked them if they would give me a refund because I didn't appreciate the way they treated me. They said no, and feeling worn out, I decided to leave. I walked straight back to my hotel, shaking and crying. Maybe it's not like they did anything that physically hurt me, but I felt very intimidated, and not being allowed to communicate while being outside scared me.    I feel scarred by this horrible service. I do want to applaud the waiter and hostess - they were great. It was the manager who really scared me and was too aggressive and went over the line.

When I go for pizza with my sisters, it's always deep dish. Always. Visitors to Chicago? Malnati's every single time. However, I realize there is not always a proper time, place, set of taste buds or stomach fortitude for deep dish. In times like these, there is Pizano's. It's thin but substantial, has very crispy, buttery crust and sauce that's salty and yet sweet.  This particular location is a bit of a tourist magnet so prices are inflated even for the city. It feels like a get in/get out operation with some disengaged staff.

Next our waiter was really short with us, and told us there was no drink menu, even though the table next to us had one.  Weird.   The final, and most important (since you don't come here for the service) is that the pizza just isn't that good.  Even though they call it deep dish, it's really thin crust with big edges.  The sauce was watery, and there was too much cheese, that was a bit stringy.  The crust was good, but that was the only saving grace.

I don't usually break it down this way, but I will compartmentalize and say: 5 stars for our server, 3.5 stars for the dining experience, 2.5 stars for the food. Being all mathematical, this would mean my overall average rating for Pizano's would be 3.66667. However, I am going to round down, because this is my review and math can suck it.  The deep dish was too thin. Simply not deep enough, people. I'm looking for layer after layer of cheese, sauce, veggie, meat, meat, meat, s'more cheese--Lou's does it! Gino's East does it! Even Giordano's is livin' large! Pizano's, your thin crust is better than most. Let's get it together with the volume of the deep dish! (Still fairly tasty, just not up to par with the others).  Our server was not to be believed. In a good way. I don't know how he did it, but ""Uncle Chotch"" as he called himself, brought us back to an era seemingly gone in Chicago, a time you knew your bartender, your server, and every person in the restaurant, because you came there every day. He was outgoing and ""aggressively friendly""--a perfect example of ""American"" for my UK friend--and nosed himself into our business. I loved it. I hated it.

This entre was also a generous serving:) Much to my wife's dismay I not only erased the Calamari, I powered down the Chicken Parm, the pasta, the dinner rolls AND 3 Cokes! Needless to say I was a full and happy camper by the time we rolled out of there. My wife had the House Salad ($4.95) and an iced tea - she said both were good. So - is $10.95 for fried calamari and $13.95 for Chicken Parm on the high side? Yes - but your talking about dinner in a tourist area of downtown Chicago so it's not bad. Check it out.

Yes it can take long.  And yes the servers can be a busy, non attentive and rude.  So go in there knowing that, and order your pizza before you even show up and you'll be money.   And for you Bull's fans.  You might want to just go here to say hi to Norm Van Lier.  He's at the bar about 4-5 days a week :)  He'll even stop in after his pre-game show to pick up a pie before heading back to work.",0.9678,0.821,0.142,0.037,0.5245614035087719
2007-09-11,4.0,"Wow, I read all the mixed reviews and all I can say is that every experience at Pizano's seems to be different for everyone. I went to Pizano's right after the CSO played at MPark and we were all hungry. We always walk by this place and it is always packed. We went and got seated immediately outside. The waitress was attentive the entire time. She got us a booster seat, made sure we had our drinks filled and the order for the pizza actually came in 30 minutes as stated.  We are pizza lovers especially for thin crust pizza. We ordered Mark's special thin crust pizza and we were quite surprised. Not your typical flour based crust but it seems to have corn meal and it gives it a distinct taste and crunchy too. We ate the entire pie (large) and my son stated ""delicious!"". I am still going to try the other thin crust pizzas like at Follia, but this was a great place to go for us.",0.9558,0.883,0.117,0.0,0.6456349206349207
2007-08-23,2.0,"I really don't understand the hype. Oprah, you have misled me for the last time. The pizza was just okay. Is this the best thin crust in the city like I've been hearing? In my opinion, it's definitely not. It was overly greasy. I did happen to enjoy the crust. It was doughy and had a buttery taste to it that I really liked. The service was definitely lackluster. Our waiter never came back to see if we needed refills on our drinks. He brought the pizza to our table but didn't come back with plates for about 5 more minutes. I know it was pretty busy but these are just basic things that I expect when dining out.  This was far from the worst pizza I've ever had, but I'm not going to be craving this like I crave Tedino's. It's not awful but there's much better places to go in the city.",0.956,0.798,0.168,0.034,0.5074561403508772
2007-07-15,4.0,"Yes  this location at 61 E. Madison is a bet touristy but I think it's one of the best Chicago-style pizzerias in the city. If you want a more neighborhoody feel head to the  location in Wrigleyville or the Gold Coast (both have great people watching). Of course you need to order the deep dish pizza here and that's why you're eating here anyway, right? Salads are ho-hum nothing too special but the pizza. Yummy! I LOVE their flaky dough crust and am a fan of the pizza with pepperonis and mushrooms. Save room for dessert...a huge deep dish chocolate chip cookie. Could there be anything better.

2007-06-30,2.0,"I went to Pizano's because it won the awards for best thin crust pizza. So I was expecting a nice, quiet place. This was a mistaken assumption! The place is downright touristy, with garish Portillo's-style decor and huge sportsbar plasma screens. We got a thin crust pizza. The crust was buttery and crisp, although I've had just as good elsewhere. I don't see how that merits the 'best of the city' award. Also, we like to have wine with our pizza, and the cheapest bottle, at $29, tasted like Carlo Rossi. Blech! Way overpriced. The greeter at the restaurant looked exasperated, but our server was a real pro. She even brought us an awesome plate of oil, pesto, pepper and cheese to dip our bread in! That was the best part of the meal. So for me, the so-so food and obnoxious crowd made this place a turn-off and slight disappointment, given my expectations going in. I wanted to write a review because no one on this page mentioned just how touristy a place it is. I think it's worth knowing in advance!",0.9631,0.743,0.184,0.073,0.5510416666666668

The crust was thin, but somehow the pizza didn't seem that thin.  And the crust has a slight cheesy taste.  If someone wanted to order this again I wouldn't complain.  Although I'd still prefer a deep dish pizza.",0.7391,0.87,0.106,0.024,0.6433333333333334
2006-11-20,4.0,"I went to Pizano's ( pizanoschicago.com/loop.… ) after work on a Thursday. We were lucky and were able to get a seat right away. I didn't smell anything weird and it didn't seem dirty to me (as other people had commented). The waitstaff was very attentive and people seemed very friendly. We did not order the pizza - we had pasta instead, which I was very happy with. I thought the prices were very reasonable for pasta, and it was nice that they had two price structures. The pasta came with a salad and a side pasta plate. The side pasta plate was mediocre, but hey it was included. I ate the Chicken Marsala, which was AWESOME. Very flavorful, and I was surprised that they brought out two chicken breasts, so I was able to share and save some for lunch the next day. We also had the Four Cheese Homemade Tortellini, which was also very good.  I'd definitely return here for a good, reasonably-priced after-work dinner in the loop.",0.9894,0.783,0.217,0.0,0.7365476190476191
2006-11-12,2.0,"I have to be honest. I have not had the pizza here as one of my co-workers said it was not the greatest.I have eaten at the restaurant and had delivery. The food was quite good. I would not put it up there with Tuscany or Mia Francesca, but it was decent food .When I sat at the bar(one of my friends wanted to smoke:(,the bartender was an old school kinda guy. I really like that! I enjoy some conversation when I am sitting there-I do not like pretentious bartenders or wait staff.(my family has been in the restaurant business for many years).I had a good experience here,the food is 3 star(which is right in the middle-nothing to be sad about). I had 4 star service,which is harder to find than great food,in my book. Update 3/20/2008 I met a fellow Yelper here for dinner before the Argo Tea event last night. I had not eaten here in some time and I have to say I was not very pleased with the food. the service was fine, very quick, even. too quick, to be honest. The pasta in both of our dishes was over cooked, to the point it fell apart the moment you put a fork to it. A SURE sign of precooked and nuked pasta. Really, Rudy, I would rather wait the extra 10-13 minutes it takes to cook pasta FRESH and have it stand up to your really good sauce. Too bad,Rudy, you lost me.",0.9904,0.776,0.179,0.044,0.5344653032153032
2006-11-10,3.0,"There is an old quote that reads ""If you repeat it enough people will start believing it even though it is not true"". I believe that to be the case with Pizanos pizza. With a recent marketing blitz, USA today mentions, and a good plug from Oprah, all touting Pizanos to have the 'best pizza', my office mates and I decided to give it a try. The Madison St location opens @ 11AM. We called and placed an order for carry out. Thin crust sausage and thin crust pepperoni ( I voted for a sausage/pepperoni combo and a veggie, got over ruled, but ended up with a veggie anyways.) We were told 30 minutes. We arrived 35 minutes later, gave the name, got a bill from the host , paid at the bar, and waited for our pies.  The ambiance is great. Excellent design, nice choice of colors, woods, and the usual vintage Chicago reminders all over the walls.  Backtrack - The greeting at the door was great, smiley, and genuine. The bartender was also professional and very nice. Kudos to the staff! OK. Waiting for pies.  The host came out and said ""There was a mix-up with your order, you can wait 35 minutes or take what I have here."" The 'have here' was a deep dish sausage, deep dish pepperoni, thin crust cheese, and a thin crust veggie (Hey! I got my veggie after all!). Sure, that a good deal. I took the boxes and ran. Another star for making it right. OK. Taste test. This is just little ol' me expressing my opinion ( I said the same about Krispy Creme. ""Whats all the fuss? Its just a frickin donut!""  And got slam-basted by devotees.) ((Puts on catchers mask)) The pies were decent, but not 'great'. The cheese is slightly sharp for my tastes, the sauce lacked in quantity, and over all it tasted like a glorified Tombstone. After one hour if sitting out, the thin crust dried and curled up, but the deep dish held on for a bit longer. So much for placing leftovers in the fridge for breakfast. Also, I like a traditional crust, this seems a bit buttery for my tastes, but was still pretty good.  I might give it another try. Call me silly, but there are far better places for pizza in Chicago. Something new, something different. Give it a try and see whatcha think. ttfn.",0.9977,0.815,0.182,0.003,0.5975770999026814

2006-08-12,3.0,"Their pizza is pretty good - but I can't say it's the best in Chicago for a few reasons. Although they do have a really great crust, the whole experience just wasn't incredible for me. I'm a fan of true Chicago Deep Dish pizza, and from what I've had, Pizanos tended to be more New York than anything (and I ordered the thick crust). I know I shouldn't review solely on the fact of preference, but the pizza just doesn't do it for me. The service when I went was horrible, our waiter checked on us maybe once during a 2 hour period, ridiculously low in proportion to the tip he was getting (Pizano's is expensive and we were a large party). To go further, the place wasn't even busy! Overall, if you have money to burn and aren't looking for a very deep dish, check the place out, otherwise, look around a bit more, there are a lot of places in Chicago with better pizza.",0.9533,0.791,0.15,0.059,0.5126416765053129
