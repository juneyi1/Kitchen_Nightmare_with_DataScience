But we didnt even receive it in the first place. We told them that this was ridiculous and her words were ""yeah this is ridiculous because you got two bags."" Yea, she pretty much told us we were liars. The delivery guy will probably just find the horchata in the car, drink it, and hide it. Never felt so unfair and never ordering here ever ever again!!

I ordered from here a few times until they messed up multiple parts of my order. I ordered their nachos and they have just basic nachos and ones that have more toppings. I also wanted cheese on my vegetarian tacos. I called over the phone and specifically asked the girl working if they came with cheese. She told me yes but then realized she was wrong. I had said many times I will pay extra if necessary but I don't like them without cheese but she insisted since she made the mistake the cheese would be free. Well how nice of her. ...except when I received my food a lot of the toppings were missing, including the cheese on my tacos and every item was wrong. I figured I'd call and they'd simply replace anything they had messed up. Wrong again. I spoke to a manager who proceeded to say he'd bring the toppings only and only if I paid extra for the cheese. What? First of all, the food would get cold by then. Any self-respecting restaurant would replace the wrongly made items. So I ended up on the phone with this guy for a half hour while he told me how replacing my food was not in his power. I got so frustrated I threatened to wheel my butt down there (because I was in a wheelchair at the time) to complain and if I had to I'd call an authority or my bank to have them forced to refund us. He kept insisting his chef would never make so many mistakes, but he definitely did. It was at this point that he finally called the store owner and agreed to replace the food as long as we hadn't eaten it yet.

Stepped into San Jose and sat ourselves. It was clean enough, not very busy, and the waitress hooked us up with some fresh chips and a pretty bland red salsa. We put our orders in, steak burrito dinner (no lettuce please) and wifey ordered tacos. Our food arrived a short time later... A couple things about my burrito. 1) DO NOT CUT MY BURRITO IN-HALF. I'm a big boy and should I not be able to handle it, I'll have my wife cut it in-half for me. 2) I'M DINING IN YOUR RESTAURANT - NO NEED TO TIGHTLY WRAP MY BURRITO IN FOIL. I get it... If I were taking my burrito for a walk, this would make perfect sense - However, I'm sitting at a table and it just looks stupid for a burrito to show up wearing foil for a sit-down dinner. Once I undressed the burrito I realized it was oozing refried beans like everywhere. It was a HOT mess. I grabbed my first bite of it's steamy goodness but came up empty for anything remotely textured as steak in mi boca. Tasted fine so I went for the next bite...  Again, no real subsistence or steakiness to it. I finished up and was left feeling robbed of steak. I think it was in there because I tasted it - However, the seem to pulverize the steak to a point where someone with no teeth would be able to suck it down a straw (in combination with the fact that the burrito was tooooo OVER-BEANED). None the less, they do not steak burrito very well here. I would think they're trying to cut corners and save money - I never really saw a piece of steak fall from my burrito, just mushy beans dripping out.  My wife's stated her tacos al pastor were average but nothing to get giddy over.   We probably won't return to San Jose... until I'm 85 and can no longer chew my own steak.

2015-09-15,3.0,"I would love to give San Jose five stars... but their service is terrible. Pick-up and delivery definitely take priority (this would probably be the way to go if you want to try their food), but if you choose to dine-in, be prepared to wait way too long for your food. The wait staff is inattentive and sometimes rude, and your order may even be forgotten.  My last visit was surprisingly less accommodating than any other. The madness of deliveries and pick-up orders toward the front of the restaurant was unpleasant and actually distracted my waitress enough to leave my food waiting at the counter for about ten minutes (we had already been waiting 30+ minutes after ordering). My chicken fajita (usually to die for) had burnt onto the sizzling pan because it didn't get to my table in time for me to stir it up a bit. The two previous times I had ordered this dish, the serving size was double the amount, not burnt, and was served with a side of beans, rice, lettuce and some avocado. This time, though, the serving was pretty skimpy, burnt, and only served with the beans and rice (which are consistently amazing). When I asked the waitress about the lettuce and avocado, she just kept saying ""Extra, it's extra,"" as if I was bothering her (probably from taking her away from figuring out what the heck was happening with the deliveries).  Needless to say, I only tipped about 5% this visit. Although the food was abnormally horrible, it's usually fantastic and definitely worth the lack of service this place has to offer.

Running around hungry after the NLC-National FBLA conference award ceremony tonight I figured what would be open at 10:30 PM?  I looked on YELP and remembered that I had bookmarked a Mexican Restaurant due to the reviews. When I called and asked if they delivered to the Hyatt Regency McCormick she checked with someone and affirmed that they did. She was very very helpful and knowledgable of the food items. She then made a few suggestions based on my food restrictions (no shellfish or red meat), just cheese and chicken. She quickly accommodated me with one of the cheese filled potato MASA quesadillas and a chicken tostada which were  bomb.com  insanely delicious!  Now you have to understand something...I am from California and I am VERY spoiled with my mother's Argentine cuisine and the local Mexican restaurant where I live.

CHUNKY AND FRESH!! By the time I got to the lobby the driver was there at the concierge desk--he was quick concise and to the point. It was very nice.

2013-04-07,1.0,"I hope I don't start ranting because I am so annoyed right now. Okay, I ordered three vegetarian tacos, no rice and I asked if they had the thinly shredded white Mexican cheese, I told them I didn't know it's proper name but where I've gotten it before that's what they call it and I gave them an extremely detailed description.  There was no language barrier because this girl speaks English just as well as me! She tried to put some like...nacho cheese type crap on my taco but thankfully I came in and showed the other waitress what I wanted and she fixed it. This was a call in order BTW. I'm so annoyed I'm telling this out of order.  Okay back to the taco itself, after I placed the order I realized she didn't specify if the taco was hard shell or not and I despise soft shell tacos so I called back like 8 minutes later. I asked were they hard shell or not and she said, ""They're soft shell like you asked for."" *death glare* I hate when people tell me I said something I know I did not say.  I hate soft shell tacos and I would never order a GD soft shell taco. Anyway, so I'm like, ""Um, no I did not say SOFT SHELL, I said taco, but I didn't specify and you didn't ask. Are they made already?? She says yeah, and since I'm such a nice person I said, ""Well, I'll pay for them since they're made already but I don't want them because I don't eat soft shell tacos and I have no one to give them to. I want to order and additional order of HARD SHELL TACOS.""  *out of order due to anger* Also, I ordered salsa of which I got three prices for, the first person said it was $2.50 the second person said it was free and the third person said it was 3.30 so I have no idea how much this mystery salsa is. I really try not to argue with people that are making my food because we all know what happens when you argue with them, that's half of the reason I agreed to pay for the tacos I WASN'T GOING TO TAKE.  So I get there, we go through the cheese thing, she says to the other lady, ""No she said the queso *somethinginspanish* and I'm standing there like...........alright now....with that ""she said"" crap. So she comes up with my order, in the smallest bag, with this extremely small package in it and I'm like.......maybe they wrap it tight? So my order comes out to $15.07. I'm thinking... hmm... 15? Well, I'll check it out when I get home... This whole ordeal took about 40 minutes and now I'm sure that first batch of tacos wasn't even ready because I stood in there waiting on the second batch for like 15 minutes. So I'm ready to gtfo of there. I go home, open my tacos, no they are not tightly wrapped. They are the smallest baby tacos I have ever seen in my life. I ate the first two so fast if I hadn't taken the picture for Yelp before I ate them I would have sworn I only had two.  So I'm stewing in this anger now, I'm looking through my wallet for the receipt and I'm like.....*eye roll* Where TF is it?! So I call them and ask and she's like, ""Oh we don't give out receipts, we need them for the books at the end of the day""....I am trying so hard not to swear in this review but what in the actual F-word?! You don't ""give out"" receipts?!  So I explain and she's adding it up and she's like, ""Your total should've been around $12.60"" and I'm like ""Yeah...........but it was $15.07"" So she says she'll call the manager and call me back. So she calls back *shocker* and the manager confirms this price. She said I was charged .35 cent for cheese per taco *Even the three I didn't get*....the .35 cent I did not know about until hours later because I would have never ordered them in the first place. So we add it up and it does come out to $15 dollars if the salsa was 3.30....... but then she says ""Yeah...the salsa is free but you paid for chips""...... I didn't even fu***** get chips. I like to eat the salsa with my own chips ""Doritoes"". I couldn't stay on the phone with her anymore so I hung up. I'm going in there tomorrow and somebody better explain to me why I paid $15.07.",0.9329,0.816,0.097,0.086,0.41442612942612933

Careful though: - the tortilla chips are super greasy - the TV program is quite unstable on a sports night and keep changing from baseball (White Sox) to basketball (Bulls) to baseball (Cubs) according to the customers' wishes. Disturbing, but not enough to stop me in my recovery dinner. Good place to refuel. Far enough from everything else for me to show up in sports gear, still sweaty from my intensive session of kickboxing. Please don't ewww.

2010-01-21,2.0,"Wow, i was just let down by Yelp.  Perhaps they need a way to distinguish between late night drunken reviews and day reviews, because Taqueria San Jose was marginally average at best.  I can think of dozens of better taco shops all over the city as well, so i was really disappointed after seeing the 4 star rating and then eating here. Ok, best thing about the meal was the gigantic fresh orange juice I had.  I love fresh OJ, and they had a juicer up front.  Good stuff.   Second best thing about the meal, the chips and salsa.  The chips were freshly made and their red and green salsa's were both fairly tasty. ANd the owrst thing about the meal was the tacos.  If you can't make good tacos, i don't care how good anything else is, you can't call yourself a #1 Taqueria.  I had the Lengua, Carne Asada, Chille Relleno and Trippa tacos (one of each).  I didn't want to drown out the flavors, when i was ordering, so i went with the onion and cilantro topping instead of the mounds of cream, avocado and cheese that the neighboring table had gotten.  This was my mistake clearly, because those tacos needed drowning. Lengua - was a thin slice of tongue laid out on the taco.  It had no flavoring and was completely devoid of taste.  I had to check that it had not fallen out of the taco after my first bite.  It hadn't, it was just tasteless. Carne Asada - Tiny chunks of fried steak, that were greasy and unappealing. Chille Relleno - The cheese definietly helped this taco out, becuase it was the best of the bunch.  It didn't really work as a taco though.  I like Chille Rellenos, but apparently not on a taco.   Trippe - They fried the tripe and it tasted like dirty leather.  Yes, i know where the stuff comes from in the body, but that is no excuse.  I doused this sucker in lime juice and salsa and i still had to spit it out. This meal was a total waste of calories.  I knew i should have gone for a hot dog at 35th St dogs instead... Carne Asada - greasy small chuinks of steak",0.8279,0.823,0.106,0.07,0.479093567251462
