2017-09-02,1.0,"This was my first time in Chicago and came here for dinner because it seemed good. I ordered the halibut with coconut rice and red curry sauce. The food was tasteless and unseasoned. The coconut rice had the taste and texture of arroz con leche, a sweet Mexican pudding type food with a piece of cold unseasoned fish. Not a good combination at all. The service was poor and literally left my whole plate because was unable to finish. My friend ordered a burger well done and got a medium rare burger. Overall customer service was terrible and food overpriced for the tasteless food.  NEVER coming back here. Do not recommend.",0.6994,0.812,0.118,0.07,0.49313725490196086

The burger with egg was okay not spectacular and my GF had their shrimp and steak dinner with mash potatoes. To be honest I was not impressed by this meal two very small fillets and a couple of shrimp and to mask the small amount they pilled on a mountain of mash potatoes it seems like I paid for the mash potatoes than I did for the steak and shrimp.

Roughly ten minutes later, he returns with my friend's drink - which he drops on the table - and, in passing, states they were out of what I had ordered without sticking around for our food order or my replacement. I might understand this if the restaurant weren't mostly empty on this blustery Chicago night. As far as the food, the appetizer came out at the same time as the main dish. Mine was improperly prepared, and I wasn't able to make any modifications - which he rudely stated in the middle of my sentence - and lukewarm at best. My friend's burger was significantly overdone.

I was talking about this salad to my parents (like I do). So when my parents came into town and wanted food after 10pm, we came here. We found some parking on Wacker, and walked in. The service was fine and since my parents got the salad this time, I ventured to get a bacon cheeseburger.  I wasn't expecting anything amazing, but this is by far the best burger I've ever had, and I've had my fair share of burgers. The meat was so good, I felt like the cheese was ruining it.

Obviously, this is not okay. I normally wouldn't have noticed, but the weird charge on my bank statement stuck out to me. The discrepancy is not a huge sum of money, but I think that the bartender just figured he would get away with it, so why not? Maybe he adds a couple bucks onto every tip he gets, assuming nobody will notice? I haven't decided if I'm going to file a complaint with the restaurant or not - to be honest it's such a small amount of money that asking for it back seems like more of an embarrassment than it's worth.

A light buzz hit me when I was half way done. Definitely try it!!  My second choice was Pear Affair, which I wasn't as pleased with. It was very strong, and didn't taste quite like a pear to me. When I buy fruity drinks I usually prefer not to taste the alcohol. This one hit me a lot harder, definitely had a heavy buzz and couldn't even finish it [hence the loss of a star, I was mislead to believe it was a lot fruity-er].

I had the Ahi Tuna wrap ($14) which came with sweet potato fries for $1 extra.  Decent sized portion and a good value for the price.  Tuna was pretty tasty.  My friend ordered the Root Beer Short Rib ($19) which was very tender but a small portion for the price.  He didn't comment either way about the taste so it must have been pretty good. Dessert was a piece of cheesecake with apple and caramel - quite good but not worth $9 - but I know that is where restaurants make their money.  And to be fair, we did share the single portion.

He enjoyed the fries but was not impressed with the sandwich. I had the chicken salad sandwich with sweet potato fries. The sandwich was okay but lacked distinct flavor and the fries were cold.

2015-09-10,3.0,Our first visit to Chicago & we wanted a place to go watch the opening night of the NFL & wanted it close to our hotel so we decided on The Sweetwater. The decor was very good & it does have outside seating If desired. We sat at the bar to get a better view of the game on TV. Our bartender was great. Very friendly & helpful when I asked for a suggestion. It has a good beer selection which I appreciated. We ordered the cheese curds & chicken nachos. The food came out very quickly. This was our first time having cheese curds & they were very good. Our first order of nachos came out without the chicken but the bartender & manager apologized immediately & got us a new order. They were very good as well. They have a lime sour cream on them which for me had too much lime but I'm not a huge lime fan. This is not a criticism because it is listed on the menu. We did enjoy our meal very much. My only criticism is that there was only 1 bartender for the large bar so at times it did take a little while to get a drink but as I said earlier our bartender was great! I would go back here if we visited Chicago again & it was close to our hotel. If 3 & 1/2 stars was an option I would go with that.,0.9896,0.8,0.181,0.019,0.5454684601113172

I ordered a Miller Lite, nothing to Yelp about on that.  My honey ordered a drink that had her favorite liquor in it, St. Germain, called the Uber Cocktail.  We were both excited to try it.  It came out in a tall glass (very odd) and was very watered down.  She could barely drink half of it, and I had to stomach down the rest.  I wondered if it had sat there too long before coming out.   I would think twice about stopping by here again, if ever in the area, for a mixed drink or specialty draft beer.  If they can't make a proper mixed drink, then I can only imagine how good the food actually is.",0.9692,0.876,0.109,0.014,0.48221230158730155

They had a pretty decent beer selection for not being a tap room.  You can find several local craft beers as well as some notable ones from around the country.  We made our selections from the locals and ordered burgers. My Fiesta Burger burgers was very good, thick, juicy and properly prepared to medium rare order.  The bun looks bigger than it really is, you can squash it down and it is not dry.  I had some grilled asparagus on the side instead of fries and it was very good as well.  Ordering just burgers may not be much of a test of Sweetwater's menu, but we both rated them in the 3-1/2 range and would certainly return.  Overall, the aggregate rating for Sweetwater is about right at 3-1/2.  Ms T had the Gobbler, a well dressed turkey burger.  As is normal, the turkey was somewhat dry and she felt it was too strongly herbed.  They offer tater tots as an option to fries.

After walking all over town during the day, we decided to wait the 15 min and sit in a booth. They got is in pretty quickly and were soon greeted by our server, Loren. He was wonderful, friendly, smiled, returned in a timely manner, and was great on refills. Big Kudos to him!! :) my husband wasn't too hungry so he ended up getting the turkey press and I landed on the pulled pork. Both meals were really good, and definitely hit the spot. My husband and I both decided to get the fries (as I've never been a tater tot fan) the fries were good, but were a little boring. Once I put salt and pepper on them, they were perfect. We had a nice relaxed dinner, and I left full and happy!",0.9921,0.754,0.235,0.011,0.5986666666666666
2015-05-09,2.0,"We were visiting for the draft. Sweet water was across from our hotel so we decided to have dinner there. We were seated right away but our server didn't come to take drink order for 10 minutes. When he did come he was very quick with us, almost like he was so busy, but it wasnt busy in there. As he delivered my beer he walked by briskly as he dropped it off at the edge of the table not even to me. We watched him moments later very  promptly attending to two woman that arrived, very patiently taking there order and turning pages in the menu for them. With that observation my husband stopped him as he proceeded to walk by us, and ask him how can we get that same service? He went on to explain why we were feeling abandoned, underserved. My husband even asked him if it was because we were a mixed couple, which we have rarely been so blatantly ignored because of that, so this was unfamiliar to us. He didnt say no, he just apologized and said he hadnt looked at it that way. Wow!!! He then proceeded after that to ask how our meal was, I said great although I couldnt completely eat the chicken, I had to eat around the truffle oil that I asked them to leave off. He said sorry walked away and brought back the check minus my chicken. I am shocked to think this is his first time behaving this way. I wish I remembered his name. But we just decided to enjoy our time in Chicago and everyone we spoke to about eating we mentioned our experience there. So for the next 3 nights we, our friends, and people we met dined everywhere but there. We even walked 2 blocks with our feet hurting from the day to eat at a restaurant we are at the night previous. It would have been much easier to do sweet waters but we felt the poor service robbed us of an hour of a great experience we could have had elsewhere.

There was a hockey game on that was slightly loud, but no problem. My girlfriend ordered a three steak, mashed potatoes combo. I can't remember the name.

The burgers here are very good; I recommend the sweetwater and my friends have liked the sunnyside up as well. I would also say that you should get the tator tots with them. My favorite thing here is the dessert. The baked chocolate chip cookie dough is to die for and even when my friends tried to pass on it; they all eventually would try it and end up eating as much as me. It's definitely too much sweet goodness for one but definitely good to share. The mix of warm chocolate chip cookie dough in a skillet with vanilla ice cream is just too good to pass. It's something I stand by if you're going to come here. In terms of bar food/drinks, it's decent and I really liked the bang bang shrimp though my coworkers were obsessed with the cheese curds.

While waiting for our food we grabbed  a couple  drinks. As I am talking to my husband  he let's me know there is a bug by me. Yes there was...a roach. Kind of hard to miss that on a white padded booth chair. I grabbed  the waiter letting  him know we had an unannounced  guest. He grabbed the napkin  off the table and kind of pulled a grab the roach and go in the kitchen.  So I thought that was gross..soup came out all I can think of was the roach when I was chewing  on the corn. Finally the food came out at this point I was not even hungry. The chicken  was on a bone  which yes I'm a picky eater but that just set my appetite  to non. My husband just asked if we can get a new one with a breast same way. Well after 5 minutes a new piece  of chicken  that looked  like it was boiled with the fat all on the side was served to me on a mini plate with no potatoes,no dressing just...bam! HERE'S YOUR CHICKEN  ! I was done... I didn't want to ruin it for my husband  and make  a big fuss bc he tried. The waiter came  by asked if the manager ever stopped  by,we said ""no"" so he bought us a round of drinks. I still tipped the waiter it's not his fault  that the place lacks pest control,a good chef and a manager that cares,but yeah ladies  just make sure to shake out  your purse before you get in your car. 10/14  Manager never once came by the table the waiter asked if the manager  came by we told him ""No"" that's how we found out that the drinks were comped. That was a roach..and I didn't see the waiter go outside with it. I under stand you passed your inspection, but a roach is a roach.  The breast  that was served  was not at all prepared  like the initial  dish. I paid my entire bill that included,appitizers,soups,main course and drinks.

The tvs are plentiful and are spread all around the bar and dining area so we were able to watch the end of the game while we dined. Our waiter was prompt and courteous. He took our drink orders right away and we ordered the cheese curd appetizer. The fried cheese curds were really, really good! My fiancée and I each ordered a different burger. He opted for the Sunnyside Up and I had the Sweetwater burger, we each had a side of fries. The burgers were amazing - cooked exactly how we liked, juicy, and flavorful. They do not skimp on the fries, and they also had great flavor and texture. It was a good thing we were very hungry when we arrived because the portions are quite large and we barley could finish it (knowing we weren't able to take leftovers we just chose to be gluttonous haha). Prices are reasonable ($11-$13ish for burger and fries). They have a full bar, drink specials, and specialty cocktails. I heard they rotate menu items as well.

2014-08-07,4.0,"Okay, okay, Sweetwater is touristy and caters to the button-up & slicked-back business crowd, but I still enjoy coming here for lots of legit reasons.  Let's start at the bar: Sam creates some magnificent cocktails for every season. She makes her own syrups and mixers and gets creative with the garnishes. Most recently I enjoyed the Grant Park Fizz, which is a delicious combination of Hendricks gin, ginger sugar, lime, soda, and cucumber. Yowza! The beer selection is impressive, too, for a downtown sports bar. Case in point, they always have Tripel Karmeliet on tap. There are plenty of other beers on draught or in bottles, but I always enjoy this big, bad mama when I'm at Sweetwater.  The servers are always attentive and accommodating. I've never had any issues with rudeness, inexperience, hovering, awkwardness, or other common issues between wait staff and customer.  The menu has standard fare, like chicken wings, burgers, salads, and fish; but there are also a few surprises...truffle chicken salad, the ""P""LT (pork belly), the ""Big Baby"" burger, and filet mignon smalls. Apparently they also do a killer brunch, which I'm excited to try sometime very soon. Lastly, there's tons of semi-private outdoor seating for the milder months. I love having a cocktail and a few apps with the hubs on the patio; it's a perfect location for people-watching. Also, it's only a block or so from the South Shore NICTD station, so if you miss your train or are super early, skip the M Bar and grab a drink here.  The atmosphere is kind of generic (could have been trendy about 10 years ago), but really, it's not a bad spot and the prices are decent.

I didn't feel well later, so it's hard to say. My mojito was good, and the other adults in my party enjoyed their cocktails as well. Their service was adequate.  Their location is convenient.

It took them no time at all to apologize, correct it, and bring us our correct order. AND THAT IS THE BEST QUESADILLA I HAVE EVER HAD. I am from Texas, and I love quesadillas. Now I have to admit to everybody that the best quesadilla is at Sweetwater in Chicago. The avocado spread was perfect. The pico ACTUALLY had a kick to it.

Pretty upscale inside, and packed for lunch even with the rain. Good sign. I ordered the boss sandwich. Cooked to order (medium rare of course), grilled onions, tomatoes and basil are the features flavors between a soft bun. I chose to get it with a side of asparagus. Another good sign.  The steak in the sandwich was cooked perfectly. It was tender and meaty in every bite. . But the bread was a bit soggy and slightly overdressed.  The asparagus, while cooked very nice, was fibrous. But I suppose it's not exactly an in season item so I will give it a pass.  Overall, $20 for a sandwich and a coffee seems a little on the steep side for me even though the food quality is good.  This place seems like it is a very good spot to come for a business lunch though, especially if you get a table in the private dining room.  I wouldn't say this is a destination restaurant, but it is a better alternative to fast food or pizza. A bit pricy, but the flavor is there.

There were a good many laughs during the commercial interruptions during the home team game.      Equally as impressive was the service.  Sam, the bartender, was a god-send. I really enjoy going to different US regions and trying the local IPA's.  After ordering what seemed to be the most impressive looking tap, Sam pointed me in the direction to the other 4 brands of IPA's (3 local) that they had avail.

My aunt got some sort of chicken tortilla soup which she said tasted as if it came out of a can. My mom got the pulled pork which according to the waitress was ""amazing"". It tasted as if it was out of a non brand tub that you get at a grocery store. The ""garlic mashed potatoes"" were non garlicky whatsoever and had no taste. My penne pasta with mushrooms & asparagus in pesto sauce was too salty, the pasta too al dente & the sauce was extremely oily.  Needless to say, we should have went to Noodles & Co.

The bartender was really nice and helpful, suggesting a delicious Two Brothers brew for my beer loving self and a tasty glass of wine for my sister.

My only regret was getting the fried cheese curds instead of one of their other delicious sounding appetizers. I had never tried curds and I always wanted to, so I said why not? Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The cheese itself was delicious, but I thought the breading was WAY too heavy. So, I contributed more to the crazy, rain-soaked Louisiana girl persona and peeled most of the breading off and ate just the cheese curds, leaving nothing but a pile of breading on the plate. Oops. All of this being said, this incident may have been more about my ignorance of the consistency of fried cheese curds rather than Sweetwater having not so great cheese curds, that's why I still gave them 4 stars.

I cut the egg open and let the yolk cover the entire burger and it was delicious! I usually don't like sunny side up eggs, but the rest of the burgers absorbed the taste really well! Fiesta Burger: This was covered in pepperjack cheese, jalapenos, tortilla strips, guacamole, and chilli aioli. I loved that the jalapenos were fresh, and not pickled and the crunch of the tortilla strips went well with the burger! I think I preferred the Sunnyside Up but the fiesta was still delicious! Baked Cookie Dough: This was just chocolate chip cookie dough, with two scoops of vanilla ice cream and covered in chocolate sauce!

By accident, I was given a Tripel Karmeliet (I had asked for another Belgian), and it was so good that my friend ended up getting one as well. Caveat: just a bit pricey. 2) Nice vibe! Think clean, classy-ish sports bar.  3) Good food! Menu consists of the usual burgers, sandwiches, etc. Everyone was pretty happy with their choices: -Big Baby: What? Guinness infused cheddar?? My friend really enjoyed this, although she said that it was hard to discern any Guinness flavor since there was so much crazy goodness going on. -Veggie: very tasty, loooooved the goat cheese in it, and the arugula added a good balance to the shapness of the cheese and olives. I added avocado to it too because, well, why not? The patty itself was probably one of the most well-formed veggie patties I've ever had. It was decent, seasoned well and held it's own in the burger, both signs of a strong veggie patty. Unfortunately, I found the olives to be a bit overpowering at times, but I didn't mind too much. -The Boss: Heard this was bomb. Meat was cooked perfectly and delicious. -Fried cheese curds: This was the highlight for me. Battered and fried to perfection. I would come back just for this. And the beer. 4) Great service and staff. We had a reservation for 9:00 but had arrived more than half an hour early, so we let the staff know and seated ourselves at the bar. 5 minutes later, someone came and told us that they had a table ready for us, even though we were still waiting on someone to show up.

So drinks were ordered, next the appetizer, spinach artichoke dip. Fantastic! Burgers were the next step with their fabulous pretzel bun. However, I wasn't completely taken away with the Fiesta burger. It lacked a punch and a zing along with nothing really standing out. The burger itself was juicy and properly cooked to my wishes.

We each started with a beer, mine was unremarkable.  It was feeling a little under the weather, so that could be it.  We also had the Spinach and Artichoke dip.  It had a perfect balance of spinach to artichoke with great grilled pita.  We enjoyed quite a bit. I was going between the Gobbler and the Trevi.  The avocado is what won me over, so I went with the Gobbler and sweet potato fries.  My dining companion had the steak salad.  We both enjoyed our food quite a bit.  The bun got to be a little much, especially after the delicious pita with the appetizer.

When we got there, around 9:30, it was practically empty. By the tie we left a lot of the tables had filled up, but there was still no wait. Kind of surprised me because the restaurant is connected to a hotel and they have a pretty good brunch selection. I had cornmeal waffles and they were perfect. They were not gritty at all, and the cornmeal made them much more rich and flavorful than any buttermilk waffle I've ever tasted. I also had some over-hard eggs that were cooked to perfection. My brother's bloody mary was to-die-for! It even came with a bacon garnish- how creative. He was semi-hungover so he told the waiter he didn't want it spicy, but the waiter ended up bringing him the spiciest bloody mary I have ever tasted. No good for hungover fellows. Needless to say he ened up sending it back. His replacement was very good though, especially with that bacon! I also had drink problems. I ordered regular coke and was brought diet two times, even after politely informing the waiter that I had ordered regular and asking if he could please bring me regular and not diet when he was about to refill my glass.

I don't know what's happened with the staff but they are terrible. They either have a snarky attitude or are clueless as to what is going on in the restaurant. There's been several occasions when I have been refused a table because my party is incomplete. I get it, you don't want me sitting at a table waiting for my guests but why does this rule apply when there restaurant is half empty? Just last week, I called to place an order and was left on hold for 5 minutes? All I asked is if I had the pork shank wings gluten free, what would that mean?? A host should know this no? 2. Reservations.....VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE to make a simple reservation. It's like they don't want customers to come in. They have some stupid rule for reservations during ""peak hours"" and when I did leave a ""reservation request"" the GM which is Raina never called me back. Twice, I've called requesting their private dinning room and twice I have been ignored. How hard it is to look at your book and see if the room is available or not and a simply call letting me know would be nice. 3. Food...I don't know even what to say....they took off the pretzel duo, the buffalo rolls, mediterranean salad and so on...they change their menu so often, I don't know what to order because they're always out of something. Not to mentioned their ""specials"" are always some sort of stinky fish. The fish stink is so bad that whenever someone orders these ""special"" the smell permeates the restaurant. But the straw that broke the camel's back was just recently...Came in to watch the Bears play, walk up to the host stand, just as I'm about to ask the girl for a table this lady walks up next to the host stand and I'm dumbfound by what happens next. This lady (I'm assuming is the manager) holds up her index finger to my face (I guess her conversation with the host is far more important than mine) doesn't say anything, has her conversation and then turns turns around and looks at me. I say table for two, to which she replies ""Hi, how are you?"" I say nothing but repeat my request, two please. She again says Hi, How are you? in a very passive aggressive manner (I guess she thought it was rude of me not acknowledging her, sort of what she just did to me a few seconds ago) I say fine, thanks...she then says ""two, ok follow me"" Needless to say, I won't ever be back.",-0.964,0.829,0.063,0.108,0.4684337797619047

This was a pleasant exception. I ordered the turkey burger, which came with a nice portion of avocado, melted cheese, and cranberry aioli on top. I scraped off most of the aioli -- it was good; there was just too much of it for my taste. The burger was seasoned well. So many places hide their bland burger under the toppings, hoping to mask it. This was a nice balance. I had the grilled asparagus as a side -- it was crispy and fresh.  My husband had the pork tenderloin churrasco with saffron rice and spicy pineapple salsa.

2012-09-18,5.0,"First off, let me just say I'm a sucker for goat cheese. It's the kind of food that can make anything taste better. I'd probably even eat a bug if it was sprinkled with it (well, maybe not, but you get the idea). I have been eying Sweetwater since I moved to Chicago 2 years ago, but I'm always afraid to try it out because it's situated on possibly the most touristy corner of the city. I recently spent a few months working in NYC so when I got back to Chicago, all I wanted to do was take in the sights of the city. I called up my partner in crime, Caelum D. and asked him to come explore the city with me. We had a nice boat cruise enjoying some wine and spirits and decided to grab a bite to eat when it docked. We wanted to try some place new, but someplace that matches our style. See, we like places with a unique menu, handcrafted drinks, and a sultry yet homey atmosphere. That's when I mentioned Sweetwater. I always pass Sweetwater on my way into the Loop and I'm always attracted to the slate colored exterior, floor to ceiling windows, and bold silver and blue highlighted ""SWEETWATER"" sign outside. Once inside, you first notice the long bar, which spans the length of the center of the restaurant. In front of the bar and around the center of the restaurant are long high top tables which can accommodate larger groups. Outlining the floor to ceiling windows are the tall, leather, quilted booths, where we sat. Its all tied together with beautiful stoned panels holding the restaurant up. They also have beautiful outside seating and all seats allow you to people watch along Michigan.  When we sat down, we were greeted by our waitress, Tamika. She was bubbling and happy which immediately radiated on to us. We asked her for a few suggestions for beer. Unfortunately, in typical female form, I was looking for a flavored beer. It's the fall, the best season for peach, cherry, apple, or raspberry flavored beer. She suggested a $12 libation, a bit of a pretty penny for a college student, but it was peach flavored so I couldn't say no. The bottle was huge and very vintage/European looking. The beer was refrershing and crisp, something I would definitely order again. My friend got the raspberry flavored Abita which also was delicious (only $6 though).  When I was scanning the menu, my eye immediately caught the goat cheese and arugula veggie burger. Now, I love my meat and I wanted my beefy burger, so I asked if I could substitute a beef patty for the veggie one. I didn't even get a ""Let me check,"" our waitress immediately said I could; flexibility is always something I look for in restaurants. My friend ordered the tilapia and spinach. When my meal came I could not stop eating. The burger was topped with melty goat cheese, a kalamata olive spread, fresh arugula, then sandwiched between a pretzel roll. I couldn't come up with a better burger myself. Its the type of burger I will always be in the mood for, but I'll probably just get a turkey burger next time; the beef was a red meat overload! And for the added cost of $1 for my substitution, I got a steal! My friend enjoyed his tilapia very much (obviously, he also gave Sweetwater 5 stars). Sweetwater is owned by Bottleneck which also owns the Pour House, the Boundary, and a few others. I would like to go check out the other locations, but will be definitely be back to Sweetwater for that burger and excellent service!",0.9986,0.801,0.173,0.026,0.5014170001905851

The meet in the burger was free range, grass few, no antibiotics used, and all that good stuff! So the meat taste tender and just sooo good! The sweet potato fries were perfect. I forgot to ask, but I don't think that they actually fry them, they tasted like they were just baked, which I prefer... it comes out tastier and healthier. The portion was huge, bf and I wished we would have split the burger and sweet potato, because neither of us finished our meals. There were a few things I would improve.... I received one tiny napkin at the start of the meal. I like to stay very clean, maybe too clean, but I would have appreciated a few more napkins. This leads me into the next thing I would improve, I'd bring our server around more. Okay, I admit it I love it when the waiter stays out of my hair and lets me eat, and that is exactly when he did,however, I would have been happy with him checking in on us half way through the meal so that I could ask for a napkin. Neither of these things are deal breakers though. Even though it was a gloomy day we sat outside and really enjoyed the patio. It was dry, and so inviting, with fresh air... This was the perfect way to end a Sunday downtown.",0.999,0.692,0.289,0.019,0.5525925925925926

This was a few blocks away from the hotel so I made my way over. I started with a Bells Two Hearted Ale and put in my order for a veggie burger. The bar wasn't too crowded but filled up the longer I stayed. The veggie burger came out soon after finishing my first beer. The burger came dressed with goat cheese and spinach...AWESOME. I could eat it everyday. Fries came on the side but I was too focused on my burger to eat them. I had a few but can't remember if there was anything exceptional about them. I squeezed in another beer, grabbed my check and made my way back to my hotel.  Wouldn't mind dining here again if I was in the area.",0.5316,0.957,0.033,0.01,0.4555555555555556

Maybe I should have gone with a burger after all which after reading the reviews was likely decent.  Dessert was the baked cookie dough dish which sounded amazing on paper but was really just so-so.

We called ahead because we didn't have reservations and asked if we needed them or if we could be seated immediately. We were told that we could be seated immediately inside and not to worry about reservations. When we arrived we asked for a booth. We wait for 10 minutes for them to clean a booth that had been empty. After they removed the dishes we waited an additional 5 and still were not seated. Eventually we seated ourselves.  After sitting for 10 minutes with no services, I went to the front to pick up menus for the table. The host was extremely nasty, rudely scolded us for seating ourselves, told us the table was dirty but she hoped we enjoyed ourselves anyway.

I love the skirt steak but the salads are also good. I can't say the drinks are the best I've ever had but they are definitely more than decent.

2012-06-23,2.0,"So, on a trip to visit friends in the Windy City this past April, we stopped here because one of my friends said he'd noticed the place open up and had wanted to try it. This was on his lunch hour while working at the Prudential Building. As walk-ins at about 1:15PM, we were seated very quickly (about 10 minutes) and ushered to some quite comfy seats near to the bar. We're sitting there, watching the Tigers play the White Sox.  And we wait. And we wait some more. All told, it's about 15 more minutes before a server even notices us. Red flag number one goes up. Server comes, takes our orders. I get myself a hard cider, sodas for the others, and we all order burgers for lunch. Server is pleasant enough and helpful. Red flag starts to ease down a little bit. She could have just had a hectic table prior to us. A few minutes pass, and out come the drinks. My cider is quite good, and I'm enjoying it.  Me and my friends get into talking a fair bit, and before long, 30 minutes have passed with no food. We start to wonder what's going on. That red flag is working its way back up, and it's got a friend. At the 35-minute mark, the server comes back out and apologizes for the delay and offers to get me a second cider, which I politely decline in favor of a soda.  At the 45-minute mark, the server comes back and assures us our food is coming. Again. Two red flags are at full mast, and a third's at half staff. At the 50-minute mark, the server and **the manager on duty** come out and assure us that our food is on its way and that our bill will be comped because of the delay. As they both leave, I look at my friends and say, ""You know, at this point, the only reason I'm staying is because it's gonna be free. Even if these were the most epic hamburgers in the world, it ain't worth an hour wait."" One hour elapses. Drinks continue to be refilled attentively by both the manager and the server. The manager, upon being asked what's going on - her response is ""A kitchen mishap."" Her answer makes me wonder, but I keep my mouth shut. One hour and 10 minutes comes and FINALLY, our orders come out. At this point, I deign to ask just what constitutes a kitchen mishap. She simply says that ""it's a trade secret.""  Really? More like someone forgot to put our orders in, or they dropped our order on the floor and had to remake it, or, heck, I don't know, maybe they had to take a trip down to the stockyards to get fresh hamburger. I would've appreciated an HONEST explanation as to what happened instead of a snarky response like that. The ONLY reason that this place gets two stars and not one is because the food, once it was delivered, was excellent. It was a great burger, and I happily ate all of it, fries and all. Had it not been saddled by an hour-plus wait, this place EASILY would've earned four and quite possibly five stars, but if I go somewhere and it takes you 70 minutes to bring out three burgers with fries? You're lucky that I'm even in the chair and that we didn't just cash out early after that length of time. Cash-wise, I tagged the place as spendy because the typical check for most people when they order food plus a beer is probably going to come very close to $30 if not just slightly over. My bill alone, had it not been comped, would've been close to $35 thanks to the cider and the soda I ordered after.",0.9969,0.858,0.123,0.019,0.44461849067112225

A group of 10 of my closest and nicest gal pals were out in the loop celebrating the ""Last Fling Before the Ring"".  The Maid of Honor chose Sweetwater for a few reasons: location, price, and variety of beers.  We made our reservations four and a half weeks ago for 8 on Saturday of Memorial Day Weekend.  We made the reservation way in advance so that we were guaranteed a good table.   We showed up at 7:50 and were told by the hostess (or was she the manager?  or the shift leader?  None of us could figure it out but we will get back to that later) that our table wasn't ready and we could wait outside.  Okay, we thought may ten/fifteen more minutes.  We were not seated until 8:35 and we didn't have water on the table until 8:45.  STRIKE ONE. We were all excited about the fresh asparagus that was offered as a side on almost all entrees and sandwiches--delicious!  We didn't even mind the extra charge for this delicious in-season vegetable.  We were quite bummed when our meals came out and there were green beans instead of asparagus. We waited for our waitress to come out so we could ask for something different.  Not only were they not what we wanted, they were cold. STRIKE TWO. The waitress brought us french fries even though we asked for a vegetable.  I know potato is a vegetable but we were thinking carrots, squash, something else.  Then, the bus boy/expeditor brought out a side dish of mixed vegetables, unbeknownst to the waitress.  Both dishes were cold and went untouched for the remainder of the meal. STRIKE THREE. Then one girl who was so excited to try a salad that she had seen on Sweetwater's website.  After two bites of the lackluster salad, she found a rather large screw tossed in with the greens.  A SCREW! Enough said. STRIKE FOUR. The hostess/manager/shift leader then offered to bring out a new salad for our screwed girl without even asking her if she wanted another salad (she didn't).  Needless to say, we had all lost our appetite.  Two girls stopped eating almost immediately.  No one at the table ate more than half of their meal (most of us had sat waiting for our new sides/new entrees anyway).  When we told the manager that we were unhappy with our meals and the screw was unacceptable; she tried to comfort us by saying ""I'll be honest, this isn't the first time this had happened, and it probably won't be the last"". I mean, WHAT? STRIKE FIVE. After many back and forths and one very upset bride-to-be.  The meal did get comped but only after she offered to not charge us for the second salad.  Well I should hope you wouldn't charge us for two salads since the first one had a large screw tossed in with it.  Then we asked to not be charged for salad or the vegetables that no one ate.  She offered to comp the 50% of everyone's meals then came back with the whole meal free. The meal was just a fiasco and with her comment about the frequency of screws ending up in meals, I don't think I will ever risk going back.",-0.9574,0.808,0.079,0.113,0.44468261330506215

It looked pretty good, but I would say its moderately priced. I gave this place 3 stars for sheer foolishness on behalf of the manager on duty and the waiters. We had a waiter that was new but we did not realize he would not be our server all night. He came over, mentioned he was new, asked what we wanted, and then disappeared. All of a sudden we had a new waiter with no warning. Interesting shadow process. But then the other waiter would come over and we would ask him for things and he had no clue. Poor thing. Then I asked the 'seasoned' waiter what a specialty drink was and she replied a Long Island.. WTH? When did that become a specialty drink?! I digress..  My biggest umph was around trying to get the game on a particular TV. I went back and forth with the manager about changing the television. She tried to make the argument that it was on other televisions, but I had to kindly explain to her that it was on every tv on the opposite side of the restaurant and other patrons were stretching their necks to see the same game. Eventually, after a few epic failures to adjust the channels, I could watch the game. I like the open space and large bar area. I would be interested to seeing it during the summer.

2012-03-22,4.0,"Sweetwater is amazing. It's a bar and grille with a VERY full beer and wine list but is more like a restaurant than anything. They have long, wide booths and high-tables if you are bringing a lot of people. Those high-tables are first-come first serve so if you don't want to wait for a booth you can grab a couple of stools there to eat. Your choice. The food is excellent. I've come here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and each time I've always left full and satisfied. If you're going to get anything with the option of french fries or tator tots, pick the tator tots. Not because the fries are bad (they are actually pretty good) but because it's freakin' tator tots! Most of their grilled chicken/burgers come on a pretzel bun which is always a plus and their wraps are very good as well. Really you'll be hard pressed to order something that you won't like at Sweetwater. The only thing holding this place back is that it can get pretty loud in there between the music, tv's, and hoards of people.

Stocked with a full bar and a large menu, the waiting staff gets the food to your table in as little as 15 minutes .During weekday lunchhours, I'm usually in and out with friends in about 40 minutes.   The drink selections are vast (usually with some pretty good beer on tap).  There are plenty of options for vegetarians (few for vegans).  The vegetarian burger never fails me (absolutely delicious - even if you're a hardcore carnivore).  You can customize it if you'd like and it comes with your choice of a side. The weekend brunch plays host to a large DIY Bloody Mary bar - make it as spicy or as peppery as you'd like and plop in a large variety of add-ons.  All that said... I recommend this place for Happy Hour more than any other time.  With TVs from wall to wall, a large drink menu, and plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, you can't beat grabbing a drink here with other friends from the loop after work.  It even connects to the pedway for easy access during the Winter. All in all, I'd give this place a 4.  It's not the best restaurant I've ever been to, but it has enough components that come together to make the establishment far better than the average American grill.",0.9673,0.859,0.125,0.016,0.5499178981937602

The wait, even on a week night, can be surprisingly long, but they do take reservations. The decor is nice and simple, and it's clean. So why the 4 stars, the observant among you inquire?

Now having been there for lunch a few times I am even more impressed.  The restaurant/bar is on the north end of the Mag Mile and has its fair share of tourists during this time of year, as well as people from nearby office buildings looking for a hurried but sit-down lunch.  The staff turns the tables over quickly without rushing people out, and gets everyone seated in a timely manner, and I've never had anything but gracious service once seated.   I don't know that the food is strictly 5-star, but my favorite lunch entree is the sesame tuna wrap, ordered with seasonal veggies on the side.  It requires very little seasoning and is prepared perfectly.  Highly recommended if you enjoy rare tuna.  The calamari also is done well.

Upon ordering my food I was clear that I was looking to make some modifications or basically create my own salad because of my diet restrictions. To get started I had to choose one of the menu and begin axing all items I did not want and add the items I did. Never during this process did the waitress explain that she is going to have to charge me more for things that were on a majority of their salads. So when the bill came I did not expect to get charged for adding a side of Salsa to replace the Vinaigrette. Initially I was just going sign the credit card receipt give my normal 20+% tip. Then gave it some thought and decided to ask the waitress why there were additional charges. Her explanation of her lack of customer service was maddening and rude. She should have said upfont that she may not be able to substitute certain items and may have to charge me more. Or, the best approach would have been just explaining to her manager the situation and get the extra charges reduced since the salad I got was sans most of it original ingredients. After paying my bill sans tip I walked back across the street to my hotel and was still pissed enough to call and talk to the Manager who then compared her restaurant to a Hooters.

On top of this, I don't see the point of going to sweetwater outside of lunch, as its the loop and nothing in the loop is relevant outside lunch and early dinner.

I have to start out by mentioning that the service was efficient and good! I am very critical when it comes to service staff and our waitress was on her game! The other thing that was great was the back of the house staff. We'd ordered an appetizer to compliment our drinks and once we were done eating, our plates were cleared away right away.  We ordered the jumbo pretzel duo. I think my friend liked it more than I did. I think I was just turned off because of the queso (it tasted really generic). I didn't finish my portion.  The waitress let us sample the beers we were interested in trying and was great in helping me pick out a good beer that I'd like.

This had a nice atmosphere and we ordered a few appetizers at the bar and they were both good (buffalo rolls and spinach and artichoke dip with pita). The first bartender that served us (we were at the bar) was friendly at first, but when one of my husbands friends came to meet up with us he insisted that his friend had skipped out on a bill 3 years ago. We thought that was strange that he immediately got heated over that when it very well may have been someone else when it doesn't seem like that's something this guy would do but we all tried to move on from that topic. After that the bartender decided he didn't want to serve us anymore? And a new person came to help us while he tended to others at the other side of the bar. With 5 people my husband and I spent a good amount on drinks and appetizers and when I flew back home I saw that my credit card was charged an extra 15$. I knew what I signed off for and the amount was incorrectly charged. I don't appreciate bartenders adding amounts to peoples bills at their discretion. That's very dishonest and I consider that on a similar level to identity theft! Luckily I called their manager (his name was Jordan) and told him I was overcharged and he was very friendly and credited me back the amount.

I know other people have commented on it before and I'm usually ok with noise, but this was like sitting right in front of the speakers with it blasting in your ears.

In fact, it is actually so packed with flavor that I usually get it without bacon and use very minimal [if any] dressing. It actually has nothing to do with making it healthier, but with all of the other ingredients you barely need anything to dress it up. Grilled cheese: they use two kinds of cheese, tomatoes, and awesome bread. Plus a side of tomato soup? Yes, please!

I would probably not go nearly as often if it weren't so convenient. Lunchtime is great but once it hits about 4:30pm, Sweetwater starts getting packed. Fortunately, now that it's summer, they've opened up the patio which has made it a lot less crowded but when the patio is closed, it gets pretty claustrophobic.  As for food/beverages, the kitchen turns out pretty good small plates and appetizers but the food is definitely overpriced.

2010-07-03,4.0,"I've been wanting to go to SweetWater since the day it opened and last night I finally went.  My favorite co-worker and I went to this place at 3pm since we got out early for the holiday season and we didn't leave until 7.  That should give a decent lead into my review.  Atmosphere:  We sat outside and it was fantastic.  The weather was beautiful and the tables, even tables for two were a great size.  The outside seating is charming and well spread apart from other tables.  But i must head you one warning- the gnats are kind of annoying as the sun starts to set.  But other than that the outdoor seating is great, and I highly recommend it. Onto the staff!  Although the staff is really really and will get you anything you ask for... You better not be in a rush.   It took us a half hour to even put our order in and it took almost is long to get our drinks.  Although we weren't in a hurry and were enjoying our time off work- I still think it was a smidge slow.  Other than that- it was great! The drink.... If you follow my reviews, you know that I am a dirty martini lover- so it should come to no surprise that I ordered a dirty martini.  I take that back, I ordered 3 dirty martinis and a mixed drink.  It was fantastic and they were strong.... With that being said however, spend the extra dollar on your vodka drinks and get the Kettle-One Vodka instead of their well-vodka, Stoli; that's one decision you'll be happy with and the extra dollar is worth it.  Keeping on the subject of price for a moment, it's a little pricey.  It's not expensive or out of the price range of other downtown restaurants, but do expect to pay $30 per person, if one orders a drink, appetizer and entree.  But again- Well worth it! The food... I was WoW'd by the food.  My colleague ordered a burger with tatter-tots and I had the grilled cheese with grilled veggies.  My colleague won't stop talking about the burger and I will forever rave about the Grilled Cheese.  I loved my grilled cheese because the cheese was stingy and it was actually grilled! Not toasted, melted or microwaved... My bread had actual grill marks on it and to me- that generates major brownie points.  The veggies weren't too bad either, there were a few too many onions for my taste, but they were great nevertheless.   I can't wait to go back to SweetWater and try everything on the menu.  I will more-than-likely bump my review up to 5 stars when I do ;)  And to anyone that wants a review on based purely on observation, someone try the Mac & Cheese.  It looked and smelled fantastic!  Anyway, visit SweetWater soon, because I know I will be back!  See you there- Cheers!",0.9945,0.826,0.142,0.032,0.5111309523809525

Then, I was ECSTATIC when the server told me the fish in my tacos weren't breaded (which I hate), in fact, they were neither battered (my preference between those 2 common options), they were simply GRILLED and served as is (AS A FISH TACO SHOULD BE).

The interior of the place is great and I'd definitely come to check it out for happy hour and perhaps test out the patio scene. The menu was filled with multiple delicious delights, which made for a laborious decision process. And guess what? They had tots. If a place has tots, it immediately is held high in my esteem. The Sante Fe wrap I ordered was the size of a small child and believe me, they knew what to do with it to. Despite how good it was, I only managed to eat half and saved the other half for lunch the next day.  Everyone enjoyed their meal and the spacious booth.

We were just chatting and taking advantage of a full lunch hour when he came up and slid the bill to the center of the table and said ""Whenever you're ready ladies.""

2010-02-04,4.0,"I got back to town just in time for NYE and with no plans, heard about a ""Metromix"" party going on and figured why not! It's hosted by Metromix right, it should be pretty wild since the website has an enormous following and per the Internet a couple hundred tickets were sold. Well... that wasn't the case, not as busy as they led on and when some people noticed that there was a lack of interesting others, they started leaving to other bars in search of better. Tix were $100 for general admission, standing room only, with 5 hour top shelf open bar (including all 70 craft beers) and hors d'oeuvres. Reserving a table and admission for the NYE shindig was quite a bit higher. I'm going to guess that the employees did a ""dry run"" practice to make sure their service was on point, the night of the event, because it was top notch. Since we were standing at the bar, we kept missing out on the appetizers as they were passed around by service. The appetizers were brought out to all the booths first and then to all of those standing by. This lounge is pretty big and it's possible that there were up to two hundred people seated at booths plus another fifty plus walking around. Even with that number of people on the floor, the room doesn't look crowded. The design and layout allow the room to look spacious, comfortable and always accommodating. Most booths fit four and some held up to six. Décor composed of dark woods on the tables, walls and bar, while seating was an off white or khaki like color, possibly leather. We stood at the bar and kept missing out on the appetizers as they came round, so I made a mention to the sweet bartender ""Joan"" and she had a waiter bring out a sampler plate for us. After that the waiters repeatedly checked on us the rest of the night, always bringing more food! Awesome. The hors d'oeuvres of the night were special for the event and not from their everyday menu, including items like fresh mozzarella on bruschetta with a tasty balsamic blend, crispy butter flied shrimp which were almost tiger sized and a bite sized steak option. Everything looked and tasted high quality. The booze was just raining that night, imagine top shelf spirits and you can drink any of their craft beers. In retrospect, going from Belvedere vodka to premium bourbons to La Fin Du Monde as a finisher, was not the greatest idea. I could go for a second round with their bourbons; the selection isn't the typical of what you might find at most other bars.  Nice spot for meeting a first date or a drink with friends after work.

The decor has a very loungey feel to it, but all the sports on TV (and sports fans standing around watching the TV's) bring it down a notch. Not that that's a bad thing, just different then I was expecting. With that said, I really liked this place. I was here around 7:30 on a Wednesday and there was a little wait for a table, so my party of 3 decided to sit at one of the long communal tables at the bar. Which worked out just fine. It was a little noiser at the bar with the TV's, but not so loud we couldn't have a conversation.  I loved the selection of beers, much better then I've come to expect at most typical after work watering holes downtown (probably 50-60+ with a good mix of pilsners, stouts, ales, etc). The wine list wasn't that great (maybe 7-8 reds, 7-8 whites) and was a little pricey for a glass, but I think they are catering to the beer crowd so I get it.  I thought the food here was really good, above average bar food in my opinion. They did have your standard bar fare - burgers & fries - but also lots of wraps & salads. We started with the spinach & artichoke dip which was served with warm pita bread. It was delish. I had the ahi tuna wrap and it was really good. It was packed with tuna and had a delicious sesame dressing. I also tried the veggie burger that one of my dining companions got and it was also really good. They clearly make it in-house and pack it full of yummy black beans and then you can choose what toppings you want on it. It is a little more expensive here then other downtown spots, but because I liked the atmosphere, the extensive beer list, and the quality of the food, I will definitely shell out a few extra bucks and be going back.",0.9904,0.799,0.154,0.047,0.48076388888888894
2009-11-09,1.0,"This is a review on the Carryout Service. I decided for lunch I would try Sweetwater. I downloaded their menu from the inter web and my eye came across the BAKED MAC & CHEESE - parmesan, cheddar, gorgonzola, parmesan bread crumbs, cavatappi pasta for 12.95 There really isn't a place in concourse of my building to get a good mac & cheese. So I decided to splurge on Sweetwater. When I placed the order over the phone, the women taking my order failed to tell me when to pick up it up. So I figured I would wait five minutes then head over to Sweetwater (which is in my office building). I got to the bar and my order was waiting for me. I paid the $14.41 for the Mac & Cheese. While I was walking up to the office I thought it was odd that the carryout bag felt very light.  Maybe I am a mac & cheese snob, but what I received from Sweetwater isn't what I expect as mac & cheese. It was cold. The little cheese that was it in the dish was hard. There was about 1 tsp of ""parmesan bread crumbs."" I would say the serving size was about 1 cup for $14.41! I went immediately back to Sweetwater and questioned the dish. The manger was kind and refunded my money. He did say that the serving was a little scant but explained that when served in the restaurant it looks like a bigger serving cause of the dish it is in. I did take a taste of the mac & cheese along with my other, mac & cheese snob, coworkers. It was awful and was immediately tossed in the garbage.",-0.6696,0.9,0.036,0.064,0.5411904761904762

I'd highly recommend making a meal out of appetizers.  Mom and I ordered 3 (and couldn't finish)- the pretzel duo (which I didn't think was quite as good as Rock Bottom, but still really damned good), the mac & cheese bites (oh little bits of heaven) and the chicken fingers (pretty standard, but not in a bad way).  Service was quick and friendly enough- the atmopshere tells me this place has the potential to get pretentious and too-cool-for-school, which is not what I was expecting in what I don't consider a ""trendy"" area but it did not quite get to the level where I was turned off.  Also seems like its going to become a meat market with all the groups of yuppies coming in for after-work cocktails -several longish tables in the bar area accomodate this pretty well, as do the mostly larger booths- smaller groups actually seem to have a little more trouble getting seated.  I smell a happy hour pickup joint. (ok, I suppose most are).  If I couldn't see out the windows, I probably would have thought I was on Hubbard Street.

Sweetwater has a classy interior mixing cream colored leather with dark woods which is just the kind of place I like grabbing a drink at. But then there are all these TV's blaring games of all types from every wall, every corner. Too much noise for me but this remodeled Bennigans in the Illinois Center is a good add to the area.  We went after work so it was packed with a solid mix of people from the neighboring buildings. We grabbed a couple of seats at the end of the bar which turned out to be a smart move as during the high point of the evening there was standing room only. But like most bars down here- the place starts to empty out around 8.  There are also high backed booths to gather in as well as large communal tables (these were filled with men slapping themselves on their backs as men do, on the night I was there) And speaking of men? If you are looking for one- stop in here. There were very few women in the place.  After reviewing the menu, and since the owners of this place also own Boundary and Trace, I wasn't surprised to see primarily bar food, wraps, salads and burgers. We ordered a burger with tots and some chicken fingers to soak up some of the stiff drinks that they were pouring.  The food came up fast and was fine (really, how can you screw up a burger and tots?) and our bartender (Angela) was on her game this night- quick with drink refills and a sense of humor in answering my friend's questions. Another nice thing?  They have a good variety of beers on tap. The only downside? This place is expensive. Granted we had a few beers and my friend was quickly emptying the bottle of Jameson but a bill for over $110 for that and a burger seemed high.  Next time you find yourself wanting to catch a game or just to grab a beer in this ""neck of the woods"" check out Sweetwater. It's a solid addition to the ""it's after work where do we go?"" list.",0.9814,0.857,0.107,0.036,0.5305346700083543
2009-10-29,4.0,"I work one block away from this place and was happy to see the world's ugliest Bennigan's get gutted for Sweetwater. Ive been there 3 times for lunch and once for happy hour.  It seems the trend in Chicago is to open up these upscale bars that serve a little higher grade bar food and this is no different. I really like the bar area during lunch.  Erica is a very very good bartender/server.  very friendly.  The food has been above average each time with plenty to choose from and the portions are decent size.  Having the big TV's all over the place is nice as they did a good job positioning them all.   Crowd is the typical downtown, young professional crowd with some tourists mixed in.  Seems like a good spot to meet a potential hook-up, hang with co-workers, and get drunk after a long stinky week of work :)  It does get loud after 5pm but who cares as long as you can hear and talk to who you are with will be back often!",0.9353,0.813,0.137,0.05,0.557283950617284
2009-10-22,3.0,"Holy TVs!  Not that I mind but do they all need to be tuned into the same game and one rogue option - Fox News (ugh)? We stopped into Sweetwater post-work; it was busy but we were able to get a giant booth right away - so nice to spread out!  Decor is nice but there are a ton of TVs and it is a little on the loud side.  While I didn't drink, loved the plentiful beer options (it's what pushed this from two to three stars).   I ordered the Waldorf salad; it was pretty good - I really liked that they went creative and added beets.  My friends tried a pita sandwich and the grilled cheese.  The grilled cheese didn't look very delicious; the cheese wasn't melted and it looked dry.  The pita sandwich looked great BUT my friend noted that it was 'okay' but not anything special.  There were, however, rave reviews on the cookie dough skillet thing. So - one star for good service, another for expansive beer list, and a final star for having a variety of food options.",0.9765,0.695,0.201,0.104,0.7048701298701299

I just can't.  It gets super packed and loud, so be prepared for a wait.  The food is ""eh (shrugs shoulders)"" but the environment is definitely visually stimulating.

2009-10-13,3.0,"This bar/restaurant just opened up about a block from my apt...SUPER excited because there are no places to hang out and watch games, grab a cold brew and nasty (i.e. YUMS) bar food w/o being around a million tourists anywhere near Michigan.  I was doubly excited to find out that Sweetwater is a sister bar to Boundary in Wicker Park, as I'm a huge Boundary fan (it's just so far from me).  DRINKS:  didn't have any last night, but was SUPER impressed with the number of beer options!  took up one whole side of the menu, tons of great brews on tap and at least 50 varieties bottled!  i can't wait to post up here to watch a football game and try as many of the beers possible! FOOD:  went here last night for dinner and was very impressed with the extensive menu! Not a normal ""bar"" menu at all...very yummy options, even a few things that could be deemed ""healthy"" (in comparison to most of the dishes), I had a real tough time making up my mind.  Went with the Tomato Basil Soup (4 stars, $4.95) and the Mac and Cheese (3.5 stars because it made me feel like a heiffer, although it was really tasty but pricey at $12.95 - me and a friend split it).  I would def get the soup again, but not likely the mac.  I was a little dismayed that the prices here are somewhat higher than what one would expect at a bar....for instance, you could get a grilled cheese sandwich for $9.95 or a grilled chicken sandwich for $9.95...hmmm...now call me crazy, but i know MEAT costs more than CHEESE, so why the same price???  i even asked the waiter, was this some super duper fancy expensive cheese??  nopes - cheddar and mozzarella.  most of the entrees were over $15 and the wraps and sandwiches were all between about $9-13.   SERVICE/ATMOSPHERE:  fantastic, and our waiter was a cutie and he told us his faves on the menu since we were so indecisive.  we sat at the communal high tables in the bar area since all the booths were taken...this will be a great place to have a group dinner because you can fit probably 6-7 people in one booth!  it was fun at the bar though and we got served right away, which was nice.  the place was nearly full and on a Monday  night at 7pm, that's pretty impressive!  great vibe, good mix of after-work people, not too many people that looked like tourists (only a few suspects at the bar) and numerous HD flat screens to enjoy the plethora of games shown at any given time.   I really enjoyed Sweetwater and look forward to going back for a full dinner and drinks over a game so I can update my review to hopefully grant them an extra star!",0.9985,0.757,0.205,0.038,0.5926847290640394
2009-10-09,2.0,"This would get 2 1/2 stars, if Yelp would finally cave and make ""half stars"" an option, but sadly for Sweetwater...they do not.  This gets a big ""eh"" from me.  A frequent patron of the other local watering holes - Houli's, McCormick & Schmicks, Emerald Loop and Elephant & Castle, I recognize that the options are still pretty limited in this area.  So, Sweetwater, in theory, would be a great addition. If you're deaf. Then you wouldn't be disturbed by the aggravating noise level that this place sustains.  Lots of TVs, so any sports fan would be happy - but seriously? I can't imagine how much louder it would be on game days.  The food was pretty good, and I like that they are generous with the tater tots - delicious.  Drinks were strong and reasonably priced for what they're going for.   I will likely try it again, the menu looked good. I had the hummus and veggie plate, which received mixed feelings from my table (I was a fan).  However, it would serve itself well to figure out how to make it more enjoyable for a couple - or group of friends - to hang out there and actually hear one another's conversation.",0.9952,0.698,0.257,0.046,0.5633809523809523

Everyone seems to love the tater tots, so I'll throw another vote in there - definitely better than the fries.  The Fiesta burger was yummy and properly cooked, but the guacamole is too lemon-juicy to be worth the calories. Unfortunately, the whole experience was ruined by an incredibly slow (due to being incredibly chatty) waitress with an awkward way of trying to up-sell us on everything...",0.6369,0.773,0.149,0.079,0.48774509803921573

2009-10-03,2.0,"I have to gather my thoughts before I actually write a review....I came here two nights in a row, first night by choice and second was because majority of my friends' ruled my opinion out.  Since I do think Boundary is a decent place, I was pretty excited that Sweetwater opened up right next to my office. I automatically thought...good food, good drinks and great scene. However, I was very disappointed. Although they do have a wide selection of beer, the food was just mediocre. The cheese sauce for the pretzels and the queso dip were so runny and to be honest it tasted like spray can cheese. However, it's really hard to screw tator tots up, so there was at least one good side to the food.  The scene is very much a sports bar with TV around every corner, but unfortunately it's incredibly loud. It definitely is not a place I want to go to again if I'm trying to catch up with friends. I had to scream across the table to be able to speak to my friends and unfortunately that leaves no room for having a discreet conversation - so beware of who you bash. If you want to sit in silence with friends and watch sports this definitely is the place to go.  Now based on location, this would be an obvious choice for Happy Hour during the week, but the place doesn't have any drink specials. It's not a deal breaker for me, but there are a lot of places in the same vicinity that have great Happy Hour specials, unfortunately this just won't be one of them.  Lastly, I couldn't help but notice that everyone around me during my second night at this place, was everyone that I run into when I'm headed into or out of the office. People I ride the elevator with, people I give dirty looks to when they're wearing a questionable outfit, people I avoid saying hello to when I'm wearing a questionable outfit and people who well...recognize me. Don't get me wrong, that isn't really a bad thing per se, but the last thing I want to do when I'm trying to unwind from a day at work and catch up with people outside of work - is see more people that I run into Monday thru Friday.  I'll be honest, this probably will become a place that my co-workers and I will go to based on proximity, but besides the great beer selection - this really wouldn't be my first choice. I'd rather find myself going around the corner to McCormick and Schmicks where I know that they at least have a great $2 Happy Hour menu!",0.994,0.758,0.162,0.08,0.586863354037267
2009-09-25,3.0,"My first impression, as the place has only been open a few days: Menu looks good, but will need to make a return visit to try it out. I was happy to see a few good-looking vegetarian options. Beer list is pretty long. Nothing too unusual or exciting, but definitely something for everyone. Prices were a little above average for the offerings, but I'm sure it's probably relative to the location. I was a tiny bit dismayed at the wine prices per glass. Most hovered around $10 and up.  Our waitress was great. Very friendly and attentive.  I liked the decor, the booths were nice. The room felt spacious, yet cozy, which I enjoyed.  My biggest complaint is holy LOUDNESS. There were a few couples w/ babies. I just wanted to ask them if they cared that their kids eardrums may be bleeding. But, the ultimate moment of the night was when this completely elderly couple shuffled through the revolving doors, one after the other, whilst we were leaving and all we could think was, ""Dear god, turn around...it's TOO loud!"" So, we waited a safe distance away and that cute little couple came right back out. We didn't need to warn them after all.",0.9959,0.706,0.267,0.027,0.5725117975117975
2009-09-24,4.0,"I'll give it 3 stars for now, and maybe revise that when I go back again. I too went on their opening night but only for a beer, so take this as a limited review.  The decor is nice, the TV's are great.  The music, yes, is quite loud -- they need to lower it a bit so you can actually have a conversation.  They have multiple types of seating options -- the bar, booths, lounge style sofas, and raised pub-height tables. As for the beers -- they have about 80 different ones which was impressive.  They also did a nice job of separating them by the type of brew and mark clearly which ones are on tap.  The one thing that was disappointing was their beer prices -- $5.50 for a blue moon / $6.50 for a Hacker Shor.  Beer Bistro (west Loop) and Clark St. Ale House are cheaper options,but then again aren't in the loop. Wasn't able to try the food as the kitchen closed early since it was the first night. As for the canned responses from the waitress -- for the first night probably just a combination of nervousness and training.  We had no issues with our server, and she was conversational about the bar itself when we engaged her on that topic. This place has a lot of potential -- will be interesting to see how it does in this Loop location.",0.962,0.819,0.123,0.058,0.5127551020408164
