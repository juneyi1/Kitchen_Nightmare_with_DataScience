2017-08-31,4.0,"This is a really cute little Mexican place on Broadway. There are probably 10 tables altogether. I came in with a bitchin' hangover and mowed down on the chips and both kinds of salsa-- the red is a little spicier than the verde but both have a serious kick and are delicious. For my entree I had the steak flautas. They were pretty good but I blame myself for not ordering something dripping in cheese given my current tragic state. That's on me though, not them! I really enjoyed the dollop of guacamole on my plate as well as the refried beans. I've had bland renditions of both items before and that definitely wasn't the case here.  Service was fine too-- she kept my water glass refilled and remembered not to put sour cream on my meal so I was more than satisfied. I definitely like this place and will go back again for sure when I'm running errands in Lakeview. They are BYOB; although I didn't indulge this time as I had done plenty of damage the night before I definitely will next time.",0.977,0.727,0.194,0.078,0.5303240740740741

2017-06-18,4.0,"Came here expecting good things, and we ate good things :) Delicious chips & salsa: the chips were firm enough to hold the salsa and crispy enough to get a satisfying crunch without any excess oil or salt. Both salsas were hot, but I loved the salsa verse better. The Queso Fundido was as fun to eat as it looked: the breakable fried tortilla shell played double duty as bowl/chips and the queso was creamy and flavorful. The chorizo added enough heat to boost the bite in the cheese. The Enchiladas Verdes was a delicious blend of chicken, corn tortillas, a delicious sauce, and topped with green salsa, cheese and sour cream. The sauce and toppings were not overwhelming the tortillas (they stayed firm and not soggy), and the rice and beans were light and savory. The Steak Fajitas dinner was just my style! It came out sizzling on a skillet, the crisp thick cut veggies and tender chunks of steak covered with a delectable glaze was the dish I was looking for! It took eight corn tortillas to finish the platter; the rice and beans were on point here as well. For dessert, we received a $free$ Nieve Frita for checking in on Yelp, and just like to entrees, this ice cream was a very large portion! I have never tried this before and I enjoyed the contrast in textures from crispy shell to velvety center.

Any time I've ordered from Grub Hub it's been hit or miss so I didn't have any expectations from Buena Vista.  I was impressed by the selection that they had to offer.  They offer many of the traditional dishes that a lot of the Mexican restaurants in the area don't offer.  The food was delivered a little bit earlier then projected so we were excited. My boyfriend wasn't 100% sold on the restaurant so he ordered tacos but he was thoroughly impressed when he tried them. For a $2.50 taco they were absolutely delicious. We were a little surprised that the tacos were delivered on paper plates when they first arrived but the plates kept them from getting shuffled around during delivery.  I ordered the steak burrito along with a steak taco. I wanted to see how the tacos tasted since I knew my boyfriend wouldn't want to share if they were delicious haha. The tacos were good but I'd definitely recommend putting the sauce on it because it'll help moisten the meat.  I was extremely impressed with the burrito! From the first bite it was warm, extremely moist, and so flavorful. I would highly recommend the burrito because it's the most bang for your buck and you won't be disappointed. I didn't get the burrito with the mole sauce so I can't comment on that one but from all the photos on Yelp it seems like a popular item. If you order beverages they deliver the drinks in a cooler to keep them chilled. That's a great touch because having warm food and a cold drink gives you the effect of being at the restaurant.

2016-03-24,4.0,"I just had three tacos; two pastor and one carne asada.  The not so good: The carne asada taco was tough and didn't have a lot of flavor, even though they put ""everything"" on it. Lettuce, tomatoes, onions and cheese. To me a authentic tacos should have onions and cilantro only. I understand that might be a regional standard, both regionally in Mexico and regionally in Chicago. I noticed that, depending on what hood your in, ordering a steak taco will get you different toppings. In more ""ethnic"" neighborhoods, places that I like to eat, always just put on cilantro and onion. In Lakeview/Lincoln park I understand that tastes are different, hence the lettuce, tomato, cheese combination. I'm not saying one way is right and the other is wrong. Ultimately, this was my mistake in assuming the taco would have what I want on it and I don't fault the restaurant at all. However, the flavor was mute on this taco and I probably wouldn't order it again.  The Good: All three tacos have plenty of stuffing in nice fluffy corn tortillas. They automatically included four salsa cups and limes without me asking (BONUS!!). Three tacos were plenty for lunch and I'm a bit stuffed. The pretty awesome: The pastor tacos are excellent! No, not an instant favorite or top 5 in the city or anything, but I am really impressed. This hood is a toss up for a lot of cuisine and I was just surprised at how solid these two pastor tacos are. Onions and cilantro only standard. A bit on the greasy side, but if you're ordering pastor that's not uncommon. Need a bit of salt but great flavor and texture overall. If you're in the area, there aren't a lot of solid taco options like this so this was a welcome surprise and I'm glad I chanced it. Now, would I forgo my hood's tacos or travel to get these particular tacos? No way, but if you're within a 1-1.5 miles away, I don't see why you'd go anywhere else. These and Del Sol tacos (not authentic, but delicious) are now the two that I'll recommend. Yes, I am a fan of this place! I ordered takeout but the service seems very nice. Clean little place. I'll have to try a dinner plate if I'm seeing a show or if I'm stuck in Lakeview after work for some reason. I'll definitely be back. Note: I have not tried every taco joint in the 2 mile radius but I have tried a lot. Tacos are 1 or 2 on my favorite list and my diet is roughly 60% tacos. Not an exaggeration.

I can't tell you how much fun it is to throw back a ton of whiskey and then be handed a baby-sized burrito literally ten minutes after I order it.

Not many Mexican places make the dark chocolaty mole for enchiladas....its usually red or the verde (green).  Had to try the pollo con mole and I was very pleased! The chicken was very tender, fell right off the bone and the mole was plentiful, every bite had the mole dripping off the fork.  I didn't care for the sesame seeds on top of the chicken and mole (isn't that an Asian thing?) I wish they had chopped onions and queso fresco sprinkled over the dish.  My date had chicken and steak tacos and she really enjoyed them as well and were loaded with delicious flavors!   I love when Mexican places have refried beans that are not dry and taste like paste. Every Mexican loves their beans and has to have them at some point during the day! It was a relief to have the beans moist and flavorful.  I really enjoyed the rice too.  Some places have mushy rice or not enough tomato sauce in the rice...this place had it right! The salsa and chips were delicious! I LOVE  when the salsas (red and green) and chips are not overly salty!   The service was OK.  Took the waiter quite some time to bring out chips and salsa when we first sat down and glasses for our BYOB of Sangria.  Never really came and checked on our water for refills.  They were not busy, there was another couple and a table of 4 occupied, so I was pretty surprised as to why it took so long.   All in all I did like the food, the dark mole was such a treat!

I opted for the ground beef in the enchiladas. The tortilla disintegrated with the use of my fork. I'm not sure if it was even a corn tortilla. (Which is typically what is used) instead of the flour tortilla. In any case,  again, you'd think with all those things in one bite you'd have lots of flavor?  The beef was also a weird texture..as in no texture?

I went here last week in a ""we're bored, let's try something new in our abundant neighborhood"" kind of mood and I was really disappointed. I had a veggie burrito and my sister had the chicken burrito, and we shared a side order of guacamole. Let's start with the good: the salsa and guac were both out of this world. Some of the freshest I've had, although the guac was a little too not-spicy for my taste. We went in early evening and were one of two tables filled, so service was decent. Not quite as attentive as I expected, but I'm easy to please. The bad: everything else! They use what I'm guessing is a mole sauce rice for inside the burrito, which totally throws off the flavor of everything else inside of it. It was entirely too sweet. The vegetables in my veggie burrito? Potatoes, green peas, and carrots. It was so bizarre and did not work at all flavor-wise. There was only a tiny bit of sour cream and lettuce inside of it, and the waiter never checked to see how everything was, he just brought the check. I hardly made it through half of it and devoted the rest of my stomach to the guac. My sister's chicken burrito didn't seem much better. It was soaked and soggy with the amount of meat in it, and she did not like the sweet rice either. Unfortunately, I think I'll stick to Chipotle when I'm in the mood for a burrito in this area.",0.6079,0.827,0.093,0.08,0.6597337006427917

While their pozole isn't nearly as good as El Norte (now closed on Bryn Mawr and Broadway), I like Buena Vista's version more than some other places I've tried. It's a bit bland though so I had to add more salt to it. This is still better than overly salted so I'm okay with it. The meat is very tender, and the hominy was cooked perfectly.  My favorite dish at Buena Vista though, is their asado de puerco. The rice was perfectly cooked. I love that the texture of the rice wasn't too soft nor was it crunchy. The beans tasted fresh as well. The star of this dish was the pork, which was tenderly cooked in a red sauce with hints of chipotle.

2011-02-06,4.0,"A brief review. . . when you're in the neighborhood and you just gotta have it, this is the place to go. Picture this: a sunny, cold afternoon; an empty restauant, save for one waiter; and a baby boomer salivating for a taste of Mexico. Since a week-long trip to Puerta Vallarta is not currently in the cards, next-best choice is something hot and greasy. So I looked at the menu and said to myself, ""Self, what do you really want?"" And Self said, I want something hot and messy and spicy and totally satisfying and probably verboten on the Weight Watchers plan. So Self and I ordered an appetizer- queso fundido with chorizo.  It arrived in a big bowl made of taco chips, with a side of four warm flour tortillas (my choice - didn't want corn). The cheese was hot and runny. A pile of chorizo was dribbled all over the surface, like gravel, but tastier. I took a taco chip and scooped out a hot, drippy mess. The cheese was melty and long trails of stringy cheese trailed down my chin. Oh my God, I thought - this has got to be better than cocaine could ever be. How could something so delicious be legal? I took a tortilla and dug in. It was fantastic. It was satisfying. It cleared my sinuses. Warmth spread through my chest (from the inside, that is - I didn't dribble THAT much!).  I ate all four tortillas, and made pretty good progress on the taco bowl itself. All this happened around 3pm, and I'd had nothing to eat since about 8am. After this, I didn't need or want dinner. I went home and belched spices for hours. It was wonderful. I'm so glad I did this. Sometime I will go back and eat a real meal there, or order it for delivery.  By the way, two other women came in and checked out the menu, and ended up leaving without ordering. One of the two was a vegan. She saw nothing she could order. They went somewhere else where her dietary choices could be addressed. I eavesdropped on them while slurping cheese and chorizo. I like my choices better.",0.9963,0.796,0.184,0.02,0.5790740740740741

The free hot tortilla chips and salsa (both green and red) are outstanding, though I prefer the more-spicy red. The place is perfect for a small group and for an intimate date. Even better, come on your own with a book during the day, sit at a table by the window, watch the folks passing by, and feel lucky that you live so close to my favorite restaurant. The Enchiladas con Mole, two chicken one beef...yes please. Honestly, once I tried their mole, I couldn't stray away from this dish. Sometimes I'll order the Enchiladas con Mole, two with chicken, one Verde with beef. I like that they're able to make that happen because from my experience, most other Mexican restaurants won't.  Once piece of advice: if you're in a bit of a rush and they are very busy, ask for the check when they come to take away your plates--or just go up to the front and pay. Otherwise, it might take 20 minutes. Also, try not to fill up on the chips for your body's sake.
