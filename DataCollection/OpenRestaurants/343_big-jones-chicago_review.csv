We started with the snapper ceivece, cornbread and the pickle sampler.  And another round !!! Nothing prepared me for one of the best fried catfish filets I've ever had and after living in Dallas for years I've ate a lot of catfish. Make no mistake this is not the paper thin fillet you get at the market, the fillet  was thick and perfectly fried.  Since we're family we all shared a taste and I loved that fried chicken, my next visit for sure!  Omg  my veggie boys pasta was fresh and so tasty! Big guys shrimp and grits...wow!!! Yes there's dessert , when in the south it's gotta be the bread pudding but the boys went for the triffle, fresh berries and plenty of yummy goodness.

Big Jones's menu changes based on what is in season, so that's pretty awesome, but I decided to go with one of their staples:  the fried chicken. Big Jones's atmosphere is definitely on the nicer side (even though I'd say you can get by with casual clothing), so I guess I should have been prepared for something different than say KFC or Church's Chicken.  It comes with voodoo greens and sweet potatoes. I thought the fried chicken was just okay. It wasn't as juicy or moist as I would have liked, and the price point for the chicken wasn't something I'd pay again for what I got. Maybe my Southern taste buds aren't up to par, but I actually prefer cheaper fried chicken joints to Big Jones. Service was awesome though!  If you do decide to try their fried chicken, be sure to order asap because they do say they need a heads-up to prepare it.",0.9901,0.799,0.201,0.0,0.6219806763285024

Corn cakes served with Omari gravy (aka salsa), beans, egg, avocado, cheese, and sour cream. My mouth is drooling just thinking about the dish.  They serve complimentary beignets for the table, which were quite tasty. Light and flaky with plenty of powdered sugar. They also had a full bar.

2017-08-10,3.0,"The first word which comes to mind is ""overrated"". Friends invited me out for brunch here one Sunday morning after raving about it for months. We started with the beignet and if it hadn't been for the water I might've needed a Heimlich maneuver. Dense and dry. I ordered an eggs Benedict dish with Tasso ham over popovers. The ham was chewy and stringy and the only thing on the plate that had any flavor. Even the popover was flavorless and a bit soggy. My Bloody Mary tasted watered down. My friends ordered the Sally Lunn bread which may have started in the 13th century but it should have stayed there, too. Again, it was flavorless and the kind of bread your 9yo might have made that you'd be obliged to choke down. A theme was developing here. Next came the spoon bread but ""bread"" is a bit of an overstatement. It did have an interesting taste and a consistency similar to a soufflé but without the richness. A friend had a roast mushroom dish that was decent. They didn't screw up roasting mushrooms. The dessert was ok but not memorable. In fact, I can't even remember what I had. At that meal the coffee was the best part. Big Jones is the kind of ""local"" centric restaurant more concerned with the sourcing of the ingredients they use than with the taste of the food they produce. It's with no exaggeration I say eggs, hash browns and pancakes from Denny's would have been more flavorful and satisfying. With such concern over ingredients it's almost impressive to assemble a collection with so little flavor. Even the butter! I've had better margarine. My first suggestion to the chef would be... salt. Use it. I tend to trust the opinion of at least one of my friends who agreed it was an ""off"" day. She also privately admitted she likes it far less than her husband. I'd probably give it another chance but not if I had other options. Reading through the reviews posted here it's the critical ones which ring true to me.

So the fried chicken is that good.  It's cooked in lard and ham drippings.  It's so delicious and moist.  It came with greens and red beans and rice.  They both were seasoned properly and cooked well.  I added some hot sauce and it was demolished.   We had the shrimp and grits.  The grits were infused with cheese.  It had a deep, rich flavor, that really showcased the love that was put into this dish.  We added a little hot sauce again, and it was perfect. The gumbo had a real chocolate colored roux.  It had andouille, pork, chicken, and it was really nice.  The flavor was very thick and deep.  It tasted like it was slow cooked for hours.   The two misses were the Bread Pudding and Sweet Tea.  The rum was too strong.  They didn't cook all the alcohol out.  So we didn't really eat the sauce.  We just ate the bread and ice cream.  Also, the Sweet Tea was pretty good.  But, when I got my second glass, it didn't have any sugar in it.  It was a regular unsweetened iced tea.   But overall, this meal was wonderful and I would definitely go again.",0.9959,0.765,0.228,0.007,0.5813265669515668

2017-07-05,4.0,"Dined with my son and a friend for a great brunch of Southern Hospitality! We were seated right away in their back room where it was quieter and my son could play with his toy cars while we all enjoyed the delightful food.  My friend suggested we come here due to the use of original recipes for a lot of the cuisine. He knows me so well. I was elated! The names of the dishes alone thrilled me, and the idea of trying recipes from as far back as the 1930's hooked me (the baked goods go as far back as the 13th century). We shared the 'Eugene's Breakfast in Mobile, circa 1930' - an Alabama catfish fried in a golden rice and corn flour bread blend with a side of fried plantains, black beans, and buttered southern rice. The aromatics were astounding; the sides mixed with the catfish for a fragrant combination of flavors. The crispy batter kept the catfish moist on the inside and I even dipped a piece into the savory black bean sauce. We also tried the 'Eggs New Orleans' - Blue Crab crabcakes (from Lake Pontchartrain) with poached eggs and bearnaise sauce on popovers, and a side of Potatoes O'Brien.  The crabcakes were plump, the eggs delicate, and the potatoes were quite crispy. I love poached eggs the best and these were perfectly made. I could easily have finished another serving :) My son loved his pancakes and fruit bowl. The apples and pineapple were thoughtfully diced and the pancakes fluffy and light. He also had a bit of the crabcakes and plantains.  The Boucherie Board was way larger than we anticipated, and ended taking most of it with us to enjoy on our walk around Andersonville. The meats were mouthwatering, the breads were breathtaking, the pickled veggies pleasant, and the jams were....well, jammin'.  The meal also included sweet and generously portioned beignets. They were a lovely, sugary addition to the meal. Because Big Jones' southern heirloom cooking uses historically rooted recipes with locally sourced ingredients, I was impressed beyond belief and will be back to snag some of their biscuits, scones, and muffins.",0.9978,0.78,0.215,0.005,0.5107094757094758

There's almost always an exception the rule & Big Jones is just that. I thoroughly enjoyed their food. Sure they're not without fault but no restaurant is perfect. Today we were seated on the rear patio which tbh I didn't know existed. It was virtually covered with umbrellas which blocked the beaming sun & although crowded in the front of the restaurant the patio was a nice & quiet oasis. My aperitif which was a Sazerac was stiff & smooth. It was served in a chilled glass which was cool because it didn't dilute the cocktail. The mimosa was boring, I wouldn't recommend it. Allegedly they serve complimentary beignets but the demand is so high that it may take awhile for you to receive them. I really enjoyed the shrimp & grits. The flavor was full & bold just like real New Orleans cuisine & the gravy was a nice touch to a dish that's overdone in several restaurants. The crab cake Benedict had highs & lows. The eggs were cooked to absolute perfection however there was virtually no crab in the dish. It was more a scrambled egg with potato hash than a crab cake Benedict.

Jordan and I split the Eggs New Orleans, which is a MASSIVE dish! It's like eggs Benedict, but exponentially better, because instead of serving the poached eggs on top of boring English muffins, these poached eggs are served atop popovers and crab cakes, SERIOUSLY!!! It was hugely delicious! It's even come with a side of crispy hash browns!  I was also impressed with the Bloody Mary, which had excellent flavors! It has a horseradish kick, but nothing too spicy and is served with asparagus, pickle and pickled okra. And also surprised by the complimentary order of beignets (in place of bread).

2017-05-05,3.0,"Stand back!! Time for me to throw my review into the pile.. Visited for brunch on Easter with friends. We had a 2:30 pm reservation and still waited outside for about 15 minutes to be seated. BJ in Andersonville is a homey spot, rather boxy and outfitted with a tiny bar in the corner. Cooking is new orleans style, think southern comfort. We were starving which was too bad b/c our food took forever to come. In the spirit of the holiday, I forgave them. The plate of free beignets didn't hurt either. The chantarelle mushroom omelet tasted super rich despite the fact that I requested it be made with egg whites. (Which it was, along with undeniable amounts of cream and butter.) The side of ham was huge and drenched in a sweet sauce - score! My friend had the gumbo and loved it. They have Hurricanes on the menu, but I was being a good girl in honor of Easter and for once DID NOT BOOZE at brunch mom - I swear.",0.9757,0.783,0.187,0.029,0.525990675990676

The three of us shared the skillet cornbread, okra, mac and cheese, and a short rib app that doesn't seem to be on the menu anymore, and each of us got the chicken dinner. Everything was cooked to Southern perfection--and this is coming from a gal who grew up in the South!! The standouts were the okra and cornbread. The chicken was, as expected, great--it doesn't seem like a huge portion, particularly for the price, but the crispness married with the fresh chicken gives you a wonderful and not overwhelmingly greasy meal.

I highly recommend getting reservations; this place fills up on a Sunday!! We got a reservation for 12:30, and still waited about 10 minutes for the table; however, the food and service made it worth it!  We were tucked in the pack section of the restaurant, away from the busy front. This was not at all an issue! A quiet corner of the restaurant was a welcomed treat that allowed us to talk and have a leisurely brunch!  I've never met a mimosa I didn't like, but this was probably one of the best I've ever had! They clearly use fresh-squeezed juice, and it's a decent amount of booze; I really enjoyed it!  Complimentary beignets are spectacular! They're hot out of the fryer, really light and airy, and not at all dense, which makes them a perfect powdered sugar-dusted amuse bouche.  I ordered the Big Jones benedict, which was spec-tacular!! Instead of an English muffin, you get two flakey, puffy, popovers, which was a really nice, and creative touch! It also provides more of a bowl-like vehicle for the meat, poached eggs and sauce. The house-cured ham was super-tender and had a good smoky flavor. They cook it in cream, which kind of sucked some of the flavor out of it, but it was still pretty darn good! The eggs were perfectly cooked, and the béarnaise sauce had a lovely, buttery, rich flavor to it! Easily one of the best eggs benedicts I've ever eaten! The potatoes were also fan-tastic; they had a nice crispy top, and mixed in with some bell pepper for a little more flavor.  I also tried my roommate's eggs benedict served with a crab cake instead of ham; the crab cake had a really nice flavor and texture!! Although it was also super-indulgent, it was a nice contrast to the ham! Only table mate gripe was they received burnt cornbread with her meal--her meal was otherwise enjoyable. Despite the busy atmosphere, we had a great server who frequently checked in on us, and kept our drinks full. The owner of the restaurant also introduced himself, which was a nice touch! Expect to be rolling yourself home after a super-indulgent meal, but it's a worthwhile brunch spot, and meals that have great attention to detail even for breakfast foods!

It's a small spot and it sounded like the waits were pretty long for walk ins.  Reservations are easy to arrange thanks to the convenience of OpenTable. The spot itself is adorable. Nothing pretentious or over the top about the decor. Just super comfortable and homey.  We sat in the back area which seemed a little quieter and less bustling than the front.  The menu offers a wide selection of southern staples.  We started with the pop overs (light and airy with a perfect amount of chew) and the salt & pepper biscuits (the pepper jelly that is served with the biscuits made me wish all jelly was pepper jelly).  The beignets were pretty bomb too...not too sweet but coated in powder sugar. A mess but worth it. I had the Carolina Gold Rice Waffle with Crispy Potted Duck, Fried Sage, Huckleberries, Duck Egg and Whiskey Sauce. It was spectacular. A great combo of sweet and savory. The waffles weren't too dense or heavy so even though it was a hearty portion it wasn't too much food. My girlfriends both had the New Orleans Eggs, which featured a crab cake, poached eggs, popovers, and potatoes O'Brien.  Again, substantial portions of well done simple southern staples. Overall, a great brunch.  Didn't try any cocktails but the selection looked intriguing.  Would love to come back here for dinner. Only negative that kept it from a 5 star review was the difficulty of parking.  Being located on a busy main drag makes street parking hit or miss, especially during peak hours.  Unfortunately, they don't seat you until your full party has arrived (which is totally understandable considering the need to accommodate walkins and reservations) and it took my friend about 25 minutes to find a spot. Since there isn't a waiting area, i felt bad that we were causing congestion in the entrance waiting on her to park.",0.9842,0.766,0.163,0.071,0.5057432241671372

And the waiting area is quite small so the weather is cold, your waiting might have to be in your car or the bar across the street.  The menu for brunch has sweet and savory items, but with a fun Southern/Bayou twist. A lot of the items are also inspired from a different time--18th century, 1930's, etc. A lot of thought went into these dishes! We shared a bunch of starters--biscuits, popovers, beignets and hush puppies.  All were good, but the biscuits with that awesome pepper jelly was my favorite. The beignets were a lot lighter than the ones I've had in the past but still good.  I don't think the popovers are meant for sharing, the hollow lightness gets lost when you try to cut it up.  We each went with our own items and had the Cherry Custard French Toast to share--the perfect dessert to our savory items.  Osi and I split our dishes--which was perfect because I couldn't decide between a few things.  The Eggs New Orleans (crabcake benedict on popovers, Bernaise sauce) and the Tomato and Goat cheese omelet served with grits.  That omelet was the most perfect omelet I've ever seen--in size, shape and visual presentation. And taste wise--amazing. The tomato was fresh and the goat cheese was creamy and pulled it all together.  The grits---let me sit here and sigh again--they were creamy, rich, cheesy...so damn good.

The front was perhaps half full and already starting to get loud, so we were pleased to be lead to the small cubby hole in the back with two tables - until we discovered a speaker directly overhead playing music three times too loud. In fact, the place was pretty much characterized by unpleasant alternatives. On the one hand, there was slightly warmed over ""debris gravy"" that had all the freshness and appeal of last weekend's leftovers, and on the other hand was spoon bread that then caught our tongues off-guard with its scalding temperature. My daughter complained about her sour buckwheat pancakes, which I assumed reflected her undeveloped palate, but I tasted them and they were indeed unpleasantly sour. Poached eggs and omelettes were OK, but hardly justified the $70 tab without drinks or tip for a party of four. By the time we left the front had filled up and everyone was practically yelling at each other to be heard over the generalized din, so I guess we were lucky to have only had to compete with the music.

2017-03-05,5.0,"One of the best brunches in Chicago or possibly anywhere!  That's no secret, because you must make a reservation.  The restaurant is small, and brunch is always better in groups, so expect to wait awhile if you show up unannounced. The interior of the restaurant is nicely decorated.  The chairs, tables, dishes, and art all have a southern feel.  But it's more like grandma's house than that overdone kitsch rustic theme that's everywhere these days.  No mason jar glasses here! The drink menu offers a variety of cocktails, spirits, teas and sodas.  I had a Pear Sweet Tea which knocked my socks off.  My friend had a Pomegranate soda which was lightly sweetened and bubbly. Our group of 6 shared everything - well, almost everything.  I was in a ""JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!"" kind of mood, so I kept my entree for myself. The biscuits were served with a pepper jelly and honey butter.  A+ for the biscuits.  These were crunchy, dense, and peppery.  The other items were tasty, but the biscuits were the best!  We also shared beignets, popovers, and hushpuppies.  I did not like the beignets at all.  The hushpuppies were good.  We devoured everything. Somehow I still managed to eat my entire entree, the Carolina Gold Waffle (corn waffle with duck sausage patties, duck egg, huckleberry compote, fried sage leaves, and a dollop of creme fraiche).  Only a genius master chef could come up with something so delicious. Waffles are always delicious.  The duck sausage patty was more like a pulled meat shaped into patties.  The salty, herby flavor of the fried sage leaves tasted amazing with the huckleberry.  And who doesn't love a dollop of creme fraiche?  This dish was the perfect balance of sweet and savory.  I loved that the ingredients were experimental, but not completely foreign, and now I want to spend all afternoon frying sage leaves and picking huckleberries. The Eggs New Orleans (crab cakes and bearnaise sauce served on popovers) and the sweet potato pancakes also looked tasty.  A lot of the entrees use popovers and biscuits so you have the opportunity to try many things.   Everyone seemed super satisfied with their food, we definitely need a nap afterwards!

2017-02-27,4.0,"I'm agreeing with the general consensus here. Brunch was a solid four stars. The great company may be clouding my judgment a little, but I'm gonna roll with it.  If you can parallel park, parking seems easy enough. If you can't, you may have to drive a little further to find a big, fat parking spot on a side street. Not that I know from experience or anything. The neighborhood seemed pretty nice, so I didn't mind walking a bit.  The waiting area is probably right for about four to six people, but this is a happening place and the people just squeeze in and get cozy. We were seated with our backs to the wall dividing the dining area from the waiting area so we elbowed a few fellow diners while they were waiting as the spilled into the dining area. Sorry about that, folks! Let's talk food!  I would order the majority of what we tried again, so I think it was a success. We started with a plate of beignets to share. I think they had a little extra spice in there that was unexpected. Nutmeg maybe?  Whatever it was, there was just a touch of it. And it was good. We moved on to splitting up some popovers and biscuits. I was really looking forward to the popovers, but I wasn't overly thrilled with them. I did love the jam/preserves that came along with them though. Real whole berries made it extra special!  Those biscuits though...they didn't look exciting, but they were fab!!  And the pepper jelly that came along side was surprisingly excellent!  Sadly, the butter that arrived with both was rock hard and didn't exactly melt, but it was a minor detail at that point.  We all tried our own entrees and everyone went with a little something different. I had some entree-envy looking at crispy duck patties that looked like sausage patties and some gorgeous crab cakes!  I went with the sweet potato pancakes and a side of thick bacon. So I envisioned shredded sweet potatoes like a regular potato pancake. I should have asked. The sweet potatoes were mashed/blended and used as part of the pancake batter. They were fork tender and a really tasty layer of sweet cream was in between the pancakes along with some crunchy granola which added a nice texture. I would suggest sharing these with someone and not trying to eat all of that ""sweet"" at once. The bacon had a little glaze and was pretty good. I wish it had been cooked a little more, but now I know to ask for it more well done.  The hush puppies. Hmmmm. I liked the flavor. But they were room temperature. And I don't think the centers were cooked fully. Had they been hot, I think I would have appreciated them a bit more. Plus, a zesty dipping sauce may have helped. This was a miss for me.  We ended the meal splitting a plate of caramel apple French toast with whipped cream. It was very sweet - and I like sweet. But about two bites was sufficient. Share this with someone because it's good, but you don't want to overdo it.  I almost forgot...I ordered some hot mint tea and it arrived in the cutest tea pot!  With sugar cubes too. It was quite a treat! We caught a glimpse of Chef Paul when he stepped into the dining room which is always fun. It's nice to see who comes up with these unique dishes!   While it wasn't a perfect meal, it was quite good and I have every intention of going back and maybe I'll even bring the husband next time.",0.9992,0.752,0.217,0.032,0.5592509696186166

I do like how they have full pieces of corn in the bread. The sweet potato hash is perfect, the gumbo is super tasty but most importantly, the pork duet is my everything. It's the most expensive thing on the menu but I promise you it's more than worth it. Super smoky and flavorful. I returned this past weekend for their Andersonville Restaurant Week prix fixe menu and tried the crawfish etouffee, which was super tasty but doesn't hold a candle to their pork. Tried the calas for dessert and the rum caramel really makes the dessert. Highly recommend!",0.9952,0.725,0.266,0.009,0.61437641723356

I arrived and was seated although the rest of my group hadn't arrived. My waiter was extremely busy and the manager noticed and offered to help versus telling my waiter I needed something. Both were extremely knowledgeable about the menu which is helpful with some many selections to choose from (both food and spirits). Food was a-okay.

I had the biscuits.. they call them southern style, but I guess it depends on where you are from. They weren't as fluffy as one might hope. The jalepeno jelly was really delish! Next up, they serve complimentary beignets.. (not Cafe Du Monde, lol), but they are complimentary! I had the eggs new orleans - crab cake dish with poached eggs and the hash.. it was quite tasty. My friends had a few dished they weren't thrilled about at all - fish and grits and one of the griddles. Drinks - whew!

I made the reservation Tuesday morning on my phone while commuting to work. So easy. Realizing they would probably be packed , I called that afternoon to confirm, yes indeed they had us down.  As we don't get out to much, we never mind having to wait a little for our table if we can wRm by getting a cocktail or two at the bar. When I started to enquire if we should anticipate waiting to be seated regardless of our reservation the person got a little stiff and proceeded to inform very sternly they keep their reservations barring any unforeseen circumstances. Of course we got there on time and had to wait in the entry.  I am overlooking this SNAFU because they were very apologetic and actually got us sat in like 5 minutes. Everything else was perfect.  Our server was great, and seemed excited we were excited to be eating there. He was helpful picking out drinks and food.  I know that's his job, but he actually seemed genuine, which I think is a facet of good service that has been lacking in the recent decade. We started by sharing a cup of gumbo. It's a more broth based gumbo, very dark and the layers of favors are devine.

I'm absolutely happy to give this gem 5 stars. The flavors are unique. If you want splashy fusion, you won't find it here. I find the luxury of these meals to remind me of European foods. There is a depth to the flavors and dishes that you don't find in most restaurants in America. For me, I can taste the attention they give every dish. Things that look familiar, will taste differently. That's what happens when someone is dedicated to an idea, and not just asking for your attention. If you go, look for the unique subtlety of the flavors. ""No"" is a hard word to say.

About the food, my most recent visit was during restaurant week. That menu wasn't that eye catching so we stuck with the main menu. Salmon croquettes are delicious, could be fried a bit harder, but that's simply my preference. Many at my table got the fried chicken or shrimp and grits. They all looked amazing and everyone enjoyed their dishes. I chose the sea island hen or something like that(sorry don't remember exact dish name, its last item on current menu).

We were asked if we wanted to try the restaurant week menu or ala carte (which we were initially planning to do). We decided to go with the RW menu, since Eater recommended them as the places to try for RW. Anyway, we were unimpressed by the service and partly the food. Service was slow. Took us around 2 hours and 30 minutes for the 4-course menu, with long waits in between.  45 mins between seating and 1st dish. For the first course, we had the tampa devil crabs and american chestnut tamal. Both were good and food elements were uniquely combined, like blueberries and hen of the woods mushroom in the tamal. Next, the Owendaw Spoonbread. This was nice and warm, served in a skillet. It was creamy and buttery, perfect for a freezing day. For entree, we chose the braised shortrib and fried mullet (which was recommended by the server over the hen bog). Shortrib was overly salty. The fried fish was like fried catfish. Sad to say, I liked the potato salad more than the actual dish. We had the sea island benne cake and chocolate & mezcal chess pie. They're both ok, I liked the chess pie better because of the mamey ice cream. I would say, though that there was 1 exception- water server was quick to refill glasses. Everything else was meh.

We had a wide choice of seating. Once there we looked over the regular menu and jumped the shark; You are able to order dishes from the RW menu in addition to the regular menu so that's what we did.

For her entree my wife had from  the RW menu the Trumpet mushrooms with butter beans, corn, hominy and fried sage which she enjoyed. My entree was the Shrimp and Grits; the Shrimp were a little puny but overall the dish had good flavor but not as good as the Shrimp and Grits I used to get at Wishbone.

2017-01-16,3.0,"Came in at 4pm on a rainy, dreary Monday; so have to keep that in mind. The menu was a special soul food pop-up menu this week. We ordered gumbo ($9), fried shrimp and hush puppies ($13) and a pulled pork sandwich with fries ($13)  The kitchen must have been switching over from breakfast, food took a decent amount of time to come out, but the atmosphere was nice and I had good company. After 15-20 minutes the gumbo and shrimp came out. They dimmed the lights down to a hazy amber, fitting of the bland appetizers we were about to enjoy. The shrimp didn't come with any sauce although the menu said paired with a pepper sauce. Shrimp was greasy, bland, and one piece was incredibly sandy and gritty. The hush puppies were dry and burnt, but if cooked less would have had decent flavor. Could have used a creamy sauce but all we had was a hot sauce that tasted of generic heat, acid, and salt.  The biggest disappointment was the tiny 8oz bowl of gumbo. While a good gumbo has toasted rice, adding a sweet and nutty richness, this gumbo tasted deeply burnt with every bite. The meat was tender and the soup seemed like it would have been great, if the rice or whatever it was contributed to the deep char flavor.  5-10 minutes later our sandwich arrived. The 2nd and 3rd stars are solely due to this sandwich and decent service. Pulled pork was flavorful, unctuous, and melt in your mouth. The slaw on it gave a nice tang and crunch. Fries are homestyle, well seasoned and paired with a delicious buttermilk dipping sauce.  The total came to just under $40. A bit steep for 5 shrimp, burnt hush puppies, burnt soup, and a sandwich and fries.

When we arrived, we only needed to wait another five minutes before being seated and ordering. Their brunch menu was certainly expansive with a lot of amazing Southern options. I went with the Catfish & Grits, since I usually get it with shrimp. You know, I needed to diversify a little bit and catfish is always on my list of favorite fishes especially when deep fried. I also got a Sazerac with my meal since I was feeling really Southern. To my satisfaction, the catfish in my dish was phenomenal and quite possible the BEST I have had in Chicago. It was perfectly battered, deep fried, and crispy! I was shocked at how good it was especially when combined with the cheesy grits. Yum indeed. Before our meal even began, they gave us some house beignets so suddenly I was getting Cafe Du Monde vibes from Big Jones.

It was much smaller than expected but was still good. The bread with it was tasty. For my entree I had the shrimp and grits. It wasn't the best, but not bad. The grits were cheesy ans played well with the gravy. Overall not very memorable. We got the sweet tea for drinks primarily because the menu clearly indicated free refills - who doesn't love free refills? Well. Didn't happen. We each got one small glass. When we were done with them, the server whisked them away and... didn't come back. I should have said something, but I felt so awkward assuming the refills were free and getting skunked. As a former server, I hate to say it but the service was the worst part. Our server was very strange- he would approach the table and just stand there not saying anything until we ordered or whatever he was there for.

We stood waiting in a mostly empty restaurant for about five minutes though it felt like more before I asked the bartender, who had been avoiding eye contact while doing something behind the bar, if we should just seat ourselves. We did, waiter arrived with menus about 10 min later. He was quite nice after that. Had the pickle plate which was fun and interesting, though I didn't care for it. The drinks were fine.  Place fell down afterward... I had shrimp and grits. Shrimp was very over cooked, or perhaps cooked previously and put on ice and then served over grits. The grits were fine, they are normally pretty blah everywhere. The gravy was totally bland. No flavor, no spice. I was disappointed but ate it figuring one bad meal. I ordered gumbo as a desert because gumbo is delicious and who needs sugar when you can have spice!? The rue was incredibly one dimensional and almost flavorless. The rice was oddly over cooked looking but still a bit crunchy. There was almost no content and what little veggie/meat was over cooked to a pasty blandness.

The chicken was tender, but the overall dish lacked flavor.  With the exception of the voodoo greens which were full of flavor, vinegar that is.   The shrimp and grits were a bit cold, and only some of the shrimp were de-veined.  Not the end of the world, but not something you'd expect at a joint like this.  Atmosphere is great, and there's a nice little patio, which earns them their 3rd star.  Prices are what you'd expect, a bit pricey for what you get.   Overall I'd rate them as mediocre.  Not a bad experience but we won't be rushing back either.  Tip: if you want great fried chicken, head over to Mother Cluckers on Elston/Foster.  Yes it's a bit of a hike, but well worth it!",0.9882,0.807,0.184,0.009,0.5969696969696968

The restaurant is 100% occupied, every table, I guess we were lucky to even get seated despite the fact that we made a reservation on Open Table. Second impression, service is slow. I don't think it's a function of laziness, these servers are always in motion, and there's no shortage of them. Nonetheless, it seems like we're waiting for drinks, waiting for food, etc. And now, for the food.  We ordered the hush puppies as appetizer, and N had the noodles and fall veggies and I ordered the shrimp and grits. Workmanlike, flavorful, nothing fantastic, just... ok. I ordered a dirty vodka martini, and was told, hey, no Tito's, we got this local stuff called Death's Door. I'm willing to try new things but the practice of choosing dramatic names to make your brew, wine, liquor distinctive is no substitute for a quality product. The martini I judge as mediocre.

The place was packed but we were seated right away with our reservations.  The ambiance here is nice.  It's a light, comfortable and upscale southern setting.  Unfortunately, that's where the ""good ends."" We ordered popovers, gumbo, shrimp and grits and some drinks.  Typically, a meal at a restaurant, the first thing to arrive are the drinks right?  Wrong.  Then, your appetizer is the next thing to arrive right?  Wrong again.  Our gumbo and shrimp and grits were served first.  About 5 minutes after they came, our drinks were finally served once we were close to halfway done with our main courses.  After we were about 2/3 done with our meal I had to get up and walk over and ask our waiter where our popovers were.  He ran back to the kitchen and then came out and said they were not ready and that it would be a few more minutes.  By this point, we were finished with our meals and we said forget about it.  The waiter did comp our drinks but it was still a very frustrating experience.  The service was just off in every way. In terms of the actual food, the shrimp and grits were below average.  Both my friend and I both said that shrimp were very tough.  The gumbo was decent but being the hype machine that this place is, I was expecting much much more.

He went above and beyond if we had a question, and even gave me a really nice pinot noir wine suggestion. For value of the service and quality of the food, I think the prices are fair. Keep in mind that the menu is largely New Orleans inspired; theirs a lot of seafood incorporated into the menu, which is not cheap people lets me real. As some Yelpers complained... *cough*.

Unfortunately most of our dishes were a celebration of mediocrity. The.skillet cornbread came undercooked and while it was a extremely hot the butter was hard as a rock. The shrimp and grits totally lacked flavor every bite. The Etouffee pie was nothing but a massive hotpocket of a lot of spicy dough with a couple of crawfish. The pork shoulder sandwich only looks good from the menu...trust me! Thankfully my daughter ordered the fried chicken and somebody in the kitchen still cooks with integrity.

At 2:20, the head chef/owner (according to the embroidered apron) came out and started berating the hostess (or manager?), talking in a loud voice and dropping excessive f-bombs.

They had there ups and  downs such as one of the main entree attraction was there fried chicken which was well fried with a crispy skin and the mean was moist still. The part that was so good in my mind was there gumbo. Color was off at first look and the taste just didn't taste the same or even remotely close to what I had at New Orleans.

The gluten-free selection was awesome, and it's always refreshing when I can go to a brunch place and not have to default to an omelet because I can't have normal bread. I had some sort of french toast dish, I believe. (Can't quite remember. I do know that it was something I normally can't have, and that was reason enough for me to be excited.)

2016-04-07,2.0,"I was really not thrilled with my overall experience here. Came for dinner with my husband and two of our friends. While we waited for a table we got some drinks at the bar, and I had a really nice glass of Cabernet Franc which I thought would set the tone for a great meal. Things were going along ok: server seemed nice, I guess, although aloof and disconnected and struggled describing the specials, and the cornbread and hushpuppy appetizers were great. However, then our entrees arrived. I had the chicken and dumplings: I expected comfort food, perhaps even something a little too heavy but we were hungry by then and I thought, go for it. What arrived was essentially what you eat when you're sick. Bland doesn't even begin to describe it. I mean, completely underseasoned, watery, unsatisfying....I commented that I felt like I was in a hospital. It was watery chicken soup! NOT an entree, more like a starter. The menu says it's a 100-year old recipe, but I don't get it. My friend ordered the steak special, which cost $25 and was supposed to come with mushrooms and a bunch of other vegetables. When she ordered, our snobby server said ""you want that medium rare?"" She said, ""Um, no, medium please."" What she received was the size of a wedding catered filet (maybe 5 oz) and RARE. We debated if it could be reasonably called medium-rare, but regardless it was not what she asked for. I'm not sure exactly why, but she didn't want to send it back (awkward, I suppose) and ate it, saying it still tasted ok. But the mushrooms and everything accompanying it were almost non-existent, more like garnishes than side dishes. For $25, remember. We ordered dessert due to not being full from our entrees and the chocolate choice (kind of like a big plate of ganache...) was fine, if a little strange. I should say that we did not give our server a chance to correct these issues. I think it's fair to note that. But I left feeling rather angry that I should have to complain.

2016-03-12,1.0,"Ahhhh...Where do I start?! I'm a huge believer in Yelp and Eater which lead me, blindly, to this place. This spot was on my go-to list for a while, so I was excited to finally try it. After taking a quick look at the menu we realized there weren't many pork-less options so we were limited, but not completely discouraged ...just yet.  After studying the menu for a couple minutes we found maybe 2-3 items on the menu that were pork-less. We ordered the cornbread muffins to start. Ten minutes later, the waiter came out with the popovers instead. Get this, our server on his own, decided to substitute out cornbread muffins for the popovers. He justified it by saying we already ordered the corn griddle cakes which was pretty much the same as the cornbread. I never had a waiter just switch an item without asking. On top of that it made no sense because we did order a popover (Eggs New Orleans is a crabcake Benedict served on a popover). Although the gesture was nice(kinda), we wanted our cornbread.  I ordered the Eggs New Orleans and my boyfriend ordered the corn griddle cakes. When the food came out, it looked good but looks were definitely deceiving. My bfs hash brown was good but mine were almost cold. My boyfriend took a bite of his corn griddle cakes and thought it wasn't bad. Right when I cut into my crabcake popover there was a foul smell, very fishy. I went against my better judgement and still took a bite, which btw I'm still recovering from.  If crabcakes are on a menu, I usually order it so I'm very familiar with the taste. These crab cakes were so horrible I couldn't swallow the food. This has never happened to me before. I called the waiter immediately and explained there was something wrong with the crab cakes. He kindly apologized and asked to bring something else.  That bite was so bad I didn't want to order anything else but my bf insisted I try the mushroom and leek omelet. I gave in, trying to help this place redeem itself. When the omelet came out, I took one bite of it and realized they forgot to put the mushrooms. I opened the omelet which had a few pieces of leeks and literally two tiny slices of mushrooms. It was comical, I started laughing ready for Ashton Kutcher to walk out shouting...""you've been punked!!"" Then it hit me, my laughter quickly turned into anger. I called over our waiter and showed him the omelet and even he looked perplexed. He apologized profusely and asked if there was anything else he could bring me. I just wanted to leave. Meanwhile I see the chef/owner grabbing coffee, walking around the restaurant, checking the hosts stand. Seems as though he was spending more time at the front end of the house rather than in back where he should be, making sure the food is being executed properly.  I have never had an encounter such as this. Even after returning my dish twice and still hungry our food was $42!!!

The drinks and dessert - chocolate caramel  pudding thing - were amazing! We got the cheesy cornbread skillet and pea something fritters to start, and they were great. People were really happy with the catfish dish, and the chicken and dumplings. I got the shrimp and grits and it seemed like either the shrimp hadn't been cooked the whole way through, or maybe it was just really cold in the place and I ate slow? Also, I prefer to eat as a pescatarian and there was definitely bacon in the dish - not listed in the menu. I guess always ask - so my fault. Otherwise, it was great.

My other friend ordered the popovers as a starter, and they didn't come out until one minute before our meals did, which was about 25 minutes after we ordered. The server never stopped back to inquire about our food. And they kept taking parts of our meal off the table without asking if we were done, which we weren't.

The decor is great and inviting and homey and they don't exactly rush you out of here, but they are trying to turn tables to a certain extent at least during their brunch hours which I get. You get some free beignets to start with which are covered in powdered sugar and really say good morning to you! They were very, very good.  But my dish of eggs benedict on popovers didn't have quite as much flavor as I would have liked and my husband also was luke warm about his catfish dish too. They both just lacked that extra burst of flavor--where I did find that burst of flavor was in that side of cheesy grits my friends ordered!

Definitely better than your typical english muffin, but I think I may have over hyped it in my head...So really grits and beignets really won me over here.

My friend and I came for our 5:30pm reservations and the place was still empty except for a couple of people sitting at the bar. We were seated right away and water was served once we sat down. Our server was okay, she was pleasant but nothing special about making us feel really ""welcome"". They only have very few wine selections that they offer per glass, mostly are being sold by the bottle so that's a minus point for me. Here is a breakdown of what I've tried at Big Jones tonight: CAJUN BOUDIN BALLS- crispy pork liver and rice sausage fritter----it was like crabcake patties but tasteless COUSH COUSH- the crispy oysters were bleh and hot water cornbread tasted like plain fried bread FRIED CHICKEN- it was crunchy, seasoned well... The red beans and collared greens which were served with the chicken were good. This dish was delicious but nothing that I am going to rave about. ALLIGATOR & ANDOUILLE SAUCE PIQUANT- first time trying gator tail and it was interesting. The meat was very chewy and hard to breakdown. I've eaten other animal meat/parts, but I am not a fan of this gator tail.  JALAPENO PEPPER CORNBREAD- served warm in a hot skillet. Very rich, cheesy, with a little kick from the peppers and a little salty.  GATEAUX NA-NA - it's basically a praline pie, nothing much to say about it CALAS- it's just like a donut, dusted with powdered sugar. Nothing much to say about it as well. Overall, it was just an okay dining experience for me. I had a good time with my friend but I would say that I've had higher expectations about what Big Jones had to offer..maybe I expected too much.

Maybe if someone wants to try a gator tail dish, I would tell him/her about Big Jones because it's the only place I know that serves alligator meat here...but for an extraordinary dining experience that will challenge your tastebuds, specially on a night that you want to explore new flavors, then I will not recommend the place.

For the entree, I had the alligator and sausage piquant - a curry style dish with rice. And that, taste was so unique and so delicious. The red sauce had the perfect balance of spice and sour that complicate the alligator meat and the rice. I don't know if it's in their regular menu, but it was delicious!

That being said, when I went in for brunch last time, it was packed. So if you are going to Big Jones's it's wise to get a reservation.  I love NOLA food, and even though Big Jones's isn't strictly NOLA food (it combines a lot of food from coastal Georgia/Carolina cuisine), I still wish some of their NOLA staples were tastier. For instance I would pass on the Sazerac. While it's unfair to expect the Sazerac to be as good as the one from The Sazerac Bar, it was not that great, especially for the price point.  The beignets are tasty, but it's rather hard to mess up fried dough with powdered sugar, no? I had the crab benedict, which was good, and I tried some spoon bread that the table ordered, that was just alright.  I always enjoy Big Jones and like going there, but I still don't get the gushing love it gets. It's constantly mentioned in the Top 50 restaurants in the city, especially by the Eater, which I think is slightly off. Plus it's not expensive, nor is it cheap, so I always wish it was just a touch better considering the cost.  In any event Big Jones is a good meal, and a tasty place to check out. But if you're looking for a phenomenal meal, or one of the best in the city, I'm not sure it quite meets that mark.",0.9905,0.766,0.181,0.053,0.5069444444444443

We came around 9:15am for brunch and were seated right away. I got the Intelligentsia flying blend coffee (which was delicious) and my bf loved the mocha he got. The complimentary beignets were a nice surprise and went great with the hot drinks as we waited for our main order. I ordered the mushroom and leek omelette with the potatoes side. Absolutely a must to get! I have never seen a more beautiful omelette--the eggs were cooked perfectly: fluffy and moist, and the clean presentation was appreciated. The potatoes were crispy on the outside and had some chopped green peppers inside which gave it a nice something extra.  My bf got the French Toast which had a nice hint of orange, with homemade whipped cream on top. He enjoyed them a lot. Unlike other brunches where things can feel super greasy and food seems to be thrown on a plate, rather than placed with care, this place stands on its own. Overall: HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

The first time, the head chef was here and everything was beyond perfect. I would have given this place 20 stars that day. I have been looking for a really well done southern restaurant. Regardless of anything, they have the best bloody mary in town. The first time we had Bayou Teche, salt and pepper biscuits, and a simple cajun breakfast. We also received a set of beignets, no honey though. The Teche was just a, mazing. Smooth and deep flavor with the softest eggs ever. The sauce was mouth watering and the grits it came with were so good. The biscuits were these big awesome heavy lumps of delicious with some amazing butter to go with it. The cajun breakfast, while simple, was one of the best simple breakfasts my partner has had. The second time, was pretty bad. I would say 2 stars. First of all of our drinks were wrong the first time and my partner never got the correct drink she ordered. By the time she got the third drink we gave up and they were all bad. At least my bloody mary was good. First, we never received beignets even though everyone else did and we asked for them. The biscuits this time were tiny and extremely dry. Eugene's breakfast was decent but lacking in flavor. The roasted tomato and goat cheese omelet was pretty good but not great like last time. Part of this might be the fact they were packed and there was one waiter for the whole place. So I want to love this place but it's pretty bad when you have two entirely different experiences. I'm disappointed really. I want to go back but I'm worried it's just going to be another sad experience.",0.9026,0.768,0.132,0.1,0.537912087912088

I got the Bayou Teche and it was by far the best omelet I've ever had.  The eggs alone were cooked to perfection.  The combination of the spices in the crawfish and andouille combined with the cream cheese and bearnaise tied altogether with those silky eggs was heavenly.  I will go back there just for this.  (Note, if you don't like ""mudbugs"" you might not like it.  Crawfish taste a lot more earthy than shrimp, just to warn you.  It comes through in this dish.)  The grits that came with the dish were good, I just wished for a little more cheese in them but I still devoured them. Someone else we were with really enjoyed the Eggs Benedict.  I could've sworn it was made in the popovers.  I see the menu now and that was the crab dish but I know for sure there was ham.  Maybe it was a special. Someone else we were with ordered the Gumbo Ya-Ya.  I love gumbo and it was my second choice, but it was early so I wanted eggs.  I'm glad I didn't get it.  She kept complaining that it tasted burnt.  I thought she was probably just crazy as it is a very dark roux so the flavors are more complex.  She offered me some and sure enough, it was burnt.  No question about it someone wasn't stirring the roux enough and it was ruined.  I can't see them serving that all the time so it had to be a fluke so your results may vary.",0.9935,0.758,0.156,0.086,0.5491435519213298

We were immediately seated even without a reservation.  The fried chicken is an obvious must-order but we also tried the gumbo ya ya. It is very different from ones I have had before. It was very dark and thick, but flavors were smokey and spicy. I especially liked the mix of andouille sausage, chicken and pork. One order isn't ideal for sharing among three, unless you only want a taste of it. I had the fried chicken with dark meat, collard greens, and sweet potato. The breading is very unique and exceptional. It was not heavily salted or breaded, but there was a very good crisp without overdoing it. The meat was kept moist and tender. The collard greens and sweet potato, on the other hand, were complete opposites of each other. The greens were a bit too salty and bitter whereas the sweet potato were very sugary.

It was served with pickled pearled red onions, bourbon mustard and housemade pumpernickel bread. The patê was pleasent, creamy and rich in flavor. No reason to not try it if you're a meat eater. Then we got the black bean soup which was served with a cornbread crouton. On its own it was awesome but the addition of hot sauce unsurpisingly took it to the next level. Finally, we got our entrees (which I don't know how I was still able to eat it after that soup, but I managed). Both of us got the fried chicken, which took ~30 minutes. I ordered the dark pieces while my friend got half a chicken. The chicken is fried with 3 different types of fat, which really makes the skin the perfect level of crispy and delicious. The meat itself was moist and flavorful, and the sides the dishes were served with really sell the dish in its entirety. I ordered one of the punches which had a decent bite to it but was still fresh in taste, and my friend ordered one of their many hot teas which they also loved. Seriously love this place!

Glad we made a reservation since there was a huge line of people waiting to be seated. The service was just ok. We ordered our food and it took over 30 mins for it to come to the table. The complimentary beignets were overly covered in powdered sugar. Really messy to eat and i think they were trying to use the sugar to cover up the blandness of the dough. It was dense and does not compare to the beignets I've had down in New Orleans. I ordered the french toast which had a beautiful presentation but that was about it. The bread was super dry and dense. I did not want to put another bite into my mouth. Plus it was covered in apple butter and some lemon sour sauce. How can you mess up french toast? For sides I got the bacon which was super thick cut and really chewy. The way it was smoked left a weird after taste. Also got o'brien potatoes which was a lie. Don't try to label hash browns with some peppers and onion thrown in as o'brien. It was actually the most edible plate that I ordered. My boyfriend got the biscuits and gravy. It was meh.

I would highly recommend making one, especially for a group larger than 2 people as it was VERY busy when we got there at 12:30 on a Saturday. There is way more seating than I expected--they definitely make use of every possible spot BUT without it feeling cramped or like you're dining with the people next to you.

We didn't end up finishing everything. --Beignets: a complimentary trio of deliciously soft fried goodness. Our server brought these out right after we ordered our entrees. --Blackberry oatmeal pancakes: so thick, so rich, so decadent. I can't remember if the cottage cheese is right in the dough or just stuffed between the stack of pancakes, but either way it made this sweet entrée even tastier.  --Mobile breakfast: I probably wouldn't recommend this if you're brunching earlier in the day, but if your brunch is leaning more toward lunch (and especially if you have the option to combo a sweet entrée with your dining companion/s), I would definitely recommend this. The catfish, rice, beans, and relish all tasted great together. The fried plantains also added great flavor. The fish is fried, but managed to not taste too greasy nor too fishy.  --Hashbrowns: my husband ordered these as a side. I didn't really try them because it's not my thing and I was already full from everything else, but he was a big fan.  As far as drinks go, we didn't order any of the cocktails, but the iced sweet tea was nice to find in Chicago and the white rose hot tea was good as well.

""Big Jones it is,"" my brain decided, just barely before my legs started legging and my arches started arching. But a quick scan of the menu on the outside window turned off my Pavlovian glands. Top to bottom, bottom to top: no waffles. But what is this? Popovers?!? One of the big joys in my life when I was small that carried over to today!?! They were there alone in their glory at the top of the menu, and served under benedicts at the bottom. Let me confess; I'm not a huge fan of poached eggs or the benedict sauce, though I'll take a sip of my friend's Benedictine after-dinner drink on occasion. And I certainly wouldn't sully my popovers with anything but sweet butter.  With popovers accompanying no other meals on the menu, I had to get creative. The O'Brien Potatoes sounded promising, and the Tasso ham simmered in some-guy's-farm cream sounded decadent. (Really, do diners have a clue about these farms?       ""Our ham is from 'Finca Fingida' [Bogus Estate].""       ""Really?!?! Let's have that, honey!!!"") Yes, three sides would be the perfect assortment. Shortly after I sat down, an amuse bouche was set down to entertain me. Actually, about seven bouche-fuls. I vaguely remember the Café du Monde beignets in the Crescent City, but I won't forget these. With a perfect doughy-ness inside, a crispy outside, I was as high as a crescent moon. Already, Big Jones, throw down! The potatoes turned out to be perfectly-cook, shredded-style hash browns. The ham was thick cut, and classily-accompanied by the cream sauce. The popovers were as fantastic as mama had taught me to make them; and the high-quality butter was worthy of them.  As good as the food was, Adolpho was an excellent server: being neighborly, without snooping.  The only ""burp"" in the experience was the price of the mimosas. Eight dollars, when the cava alone cost $7? I'll get my Vitamin C elsewhere today, thank you.",0.9956,0.781,0.179,0.04,0.4879455782312926

Too much hype, it really is.   Brunch with a friend: Free beignets - Meh.  My first time trying them but I hope they really don't taste like Big Jones's. Buckwheat Banana Pancakes - Dry & bland. Doesn't come w/syrup, filled with a bland substance (banana maybe). Yuck.   Side of Bacon - The old school thick-cut bacon with no flavor & fat.  Yuck.   House Cured & Smoked Bacon and Early Onion Omelet (my friend) - VERY runny inside. I like my eggs & omelets cooked hard.  Yuck.  I looked next to me & it looks like they cook all their omelets runny.   Coffee - the usual.   I saw the shrimp and grits at another table & wished I had ordered it.   Cocktails at the bar during dinner time with a friend a few months ago: Chatham Artillery Punch - Good Dark and Stormy (I think) - Good Gumbo Ya-Ya - GREAT Still not quite sure what to think of this restaurant.  The ambiance makes me feel as if I'm at a plantation home at dinner or breakfast.

2015-09-11,5.0,"What's not to love about this little jewel in Andersonville? We've been for brunch and dinner, as well as special occasions with tasting menus, and we're rarely disappointed. For brunch, our favorites are the Corn Griddle Cakes, a fantastic vegetarian option as long as you don't add whatever meat (chorizo, etc.) they suggest on the side. A slightly spicy ranchero sauce, black beans, cheese and avocado over huge, fluffy and perfectly cooked corn pancakes. The shrimp and grits always deliver and it's huge! The grits have a bit of cheese mixed in, and the shrimp are in the tastiest gravy. Eugene's Breakfast in Mobile and Rey's Breakfast Posole are also big winners! We like to start with the corn muffins; I think the cheddar biscuits are a little dry. They bring beignets to every table to start, and I'll be honest - they cannot compare in any way, shape or form to Cafe du Monde in NOLA! I don't really think they're worth the calories. Every special occasion (tasting menu) dinner we've had there has been over the top. Multiple courses with beverage pairings really bring out the chef's creativity. Get on their mailing list so you know what's coming up! They typically do a nice tasting menu for Thanksgiving and New Year's, as well as Mardi Gras and more. I think these dinners are reasonably priced and a huge value for what you pay. We did the fried family style chicken dinner once, and it's great. I can't say it's the best fried chicken I've ever had, but it's probably the best I've had in Chicago. So that's saying something. Fried chicken is now available every night, not just Tuesdays, and it comes with a few southern sides. The only major disappointment I've experienced at Big Jones was the Chicken and Dumplings. I could not eat it because it was way too salty. Aside from that, if you're southern, you know your chicken and dumplings, and this was not even close to authentic C&D. Honestly, I was shocked because I thought BJ's knew their southern food! That one is way off, but our experiences otherwise have been so incredible, we'll let it slide. :) Overall, I'd say we prefer Big Jones for brunch over dinner, unless they're having a special menu. Then you've got to try it!",0.9893,0.822,0.145,0.033,0.5447931697931697

It was busy, no problem.  Unfortunately, service was very slow throughout.  We waited a while for the beignets (and were disappointed by them - much doughier than Cafe du Monde beignets), and even longer for our food.  When our food did come out, they brought the wrong plate to one in our party of four. We had to wave them back to the table, after which they took it back to the kitchen and found the right one.  The waitress then had to be reminded twice to bring ketchup, and the food was lukewarm by the time she finally brought it.   The worst part was the busboy clearing the tables before we had finished eating.  We hadn't even had our food for 20 minutes before he started taking plates that still had lots of food on them.  We asked for one back, and he apologized and put it back down, but then proceeded to take the plate of beignets.  When we indicated that we weren't done with that either, he said, ""Oh, you wanted that?"" in a sarcastic tone.  We just let him take it (I think we were all too surprised by his nasty attitude to protest again).

Ok, cool. It happens. But then we waited forever for our server and then forever for our food. For our noon reservation, we didn't have food on the table until after 1:10. Everything just really dragged.  The food itself was underwhelming. I didn't realize we'd have to brunch. I walked in expecting more lunch options since it was noon on a Monday.  We got beignets with our order. They were very dense. Wasn't a fan. My kids shared an order of banana pancakes and a side of bacon. The pancakes were awful, IMO. Very dry. No one at the table would eat more than a bite of the pancakes, they were that bad. The bacon was ok.  I had the catfish. It was ok but the portion was quite small for $16. I tasted my husband's French toast and, again, just ok. He ordered a couple of eggs on the side and we order them all over the country basted. Never have had an issue with ordering eggs basted. Here, they came out and said they don't baste eggs. Whaaa? Whatever. How can you do brunch and not know how to baste eggs?  The service is slow. Slooooow. The waitress only came by to get our order and bring us food. Thank goodness we didn't need anything else. We had to flag her down for more water and beverage refills. Just not great at all.  It was so loud that in order for the other side of the table to hear me, I had to cup my hands around my mouth and shout. I came home with a splitting headache from shouting to be heard.

Grits, cornbread, gumbo, etc.  They even bring out a plate of begniets after you order.  I kinda thought they didn't really add anything.  They were cold and doughy and covered in powdered sugar that got literally everywhere. It could've used some fruit I think.  Anyway, the bloody Mary was spot on, spicy to too.  And the popovers we got were nice.  Light and eggy, we used all the jam it came with.   The mains we got were good but not great.  I went against my better judgement and did not get the gumbo or biscuits and gravy.  Instead, it was fried chicken on top of this heirloom oatmeal.  I enjoyed it, and you do get a huge portion. My wife tried the cornbread griddle cakes.  It kinda tasted like something you'd get at a burrito house. It ended up being pancakes covered in salsa and beans with some avocado cheese and sour cream on top. Again, kinda meh.   I love the idea of this place being a southern style restaurant and the menu has a ton of interesting things on it.  I just feel I should have stuck to something a bit more traditional to get a better feel for this place.

(Be prepared to wait 30 minutes for fried chicken; the menu does state this. )The meat was moist and juicy, but the breading was sliding off. I asked for fried okra, and the breading for that came off too, so I basically had steamed okra to eat. They didn't bring any bread or beignets to the table the way I heard they do; this might be a brunch only routine. Their ginger beer is wonderful; nicely pungent, spicy and refreshing. On my last visit I had the cornbread as a side which was great. The biscuits they served during brunch my last visit I personally didn't care for. They were dry and hard, although the flavored spreads and butters to spread on them were good and spicy.  For dessert I tried their bread pudding. Menu stated this would be crunchy oat streusel, homemade apple butter, and salt caramel ice cream. What I received was the ice cream, which was very tasty, very little oat streusel, which made me sad because that's typically pretty delicious, but instead of the homemade apple butter, they served the bread pudding with a pineapple rum sauce. I hate pineapple, so I avoided it and just ate the ice cream and the bread pudding pieces that weren't covered in it. I told the waiter and he felt bad about it, (I feel he should've told me, since I definitely would've ordered a different dessert. ) But he very nicely removed the dessert from my bill, which was cool of him.

We ordered (in order of appearance at our table, we opted to share everything): -Spring(?) mushrooms - again, savory, almost meaty-tasting chunks of mushrooms, balanced with almost creamy rice and peppers -Asparagus bisque - creamy, not the most flavorful but a good choice if you like asparagus -Pork duet - Pork loin, a little tough but smokey, and a boudin ball liver croquette thing, served over pureed baked beans and accompanied by the sweet potato hash and cracklin's -Dark meat fried chicken -  A couple pieces, worth the wait with the collard greens and potato hash as accessories All quite good.  I'd repeat on almost any of them but I think the fried chicken and mushrooms would be my priority.  At this point I'll leave the disclaimer that I'm from New Jersey and I know nothing about Southern cooking, but I enjoyed everything. We wisely saved room for dessert.  You should too.  Gird your loins or what have you. Seriously, gird them.  And then get the Rhubarb and Bone Marrow Pudding Pie, because it's pretty darned amazing.  Comes with a broken up macaroon and some shaved coconut, and a healthy dollop of banana ice cream.  Not too sweet, not too sour or bitter, just nice and rich and delicious.   And we got the Calas too, because what the heck are Calas?  They're warm, soft but crusty, chewy with some crunchy bits of rice kind of dumplings that are dusted with powdered sugar and sitting beside all kinds of sweets - caramel ice cream.  oatmeal streusel.  I'm forgetting something but this review is getting way too long.

The pheasant terrine was very good, but could have been made with another protein- I think 'pheasant' just sounds more upscale so they can charge more. The entrees were both a disappointment: the chicken-fried veal steak was tough and sinewy (veal?), the sauce skimpy, the barley a bit too al dente; the 'pulled chicken' managed to be dry even in gravy and the dumplings uninspired. The pots de crème were more like tartes de crème- enormous! The chocolate flavor was good, but if they were going to slather the dish with peanuts, they could have mentioned it in the menu. I prefer my pots de crème in tiny pots (after a big dinner) and without nuts! I found the prices exaggerated.

2015-04-12,5.0,"We went on our first trip to Big Jones last night for dinner and had an outstanding experience. Not having a reservation for a busy restaurant on a Saturday evening can be stressful and can decrease the fun level of a date night quickly. However, the hostess was very friendly and knew precisely how long the wait would be for a regular table, high top in the bar, and at the bar seating. We waited about 10 minutes for a spot at the bar to open up where Andrew took over our experience. Who knew they had such a large Whiskey list?! My partner was very happy with all that was offered on the Whiskey list and I found a gin cocktail that sounded delicious. The food menu itself is fantastic and everything had our mouths watering (we were both famished and in need of food quickly). We ordered the Skillet Corn Bread, Pork Shoulder sandwich, and Shrimp-n-Grits.  As a newly gluten free person, eating out is miserable 95% of the time as most places don't have a large selection of things I can eat that aren't salad. However, Big Jones can make most dishes Gluten-Free if asked when you order. Andrew made it a point to remind us of that several times as it can be a big concern for a lot of people. So just ask and if they can do it Gluten-Free they will.  The food was fantastic. Everything was served perfectly seasoned, warm, and cooked to perfection. We both ate until we felt like we were going to burst. If there had been anything leftover to bring home, I'd be eating it and writing this simultaneously.  We ordered a second round of drinks during our meal and it was the best decision. Andrew made a cocktail for my partner off of his taste preferences and I had their Chantham Punch. Both drinks were amazing and perfect for our meals. When you are paying between $10-$14 for cocktails you can expect them to be perfect and boozy. Andrew is an excellent bartender and we would go there for drinks any time. Overall, we would recommend this place for sure. The atmosphere, service, food and drinks were all 5 stars for us. We would probably make a reservation next time but it was worth the wait. Big Jones has two new very happy customers.",0.9901,0.863,0.127,0.01,0.4988488202618638

2015-04-03,5.0,"Big Jones messed up. And then Big Jones fixed it.  Allow me to explain. A few months back, a group of my friends and I planned a night out at Big Jones. I had raved about this restaurant, being a Southerner, and was eager to share the cuisine with them. We originally started as a group of 8, then went to 6, then back to 8. I made our reservation through OpenTable, changing the reservation every time the number in our party changed. When we went from 6 back to 8, OpenTable showed they no longer could accommodate my party, so I phoned the restaurant and spoke to a lady who assured me there was an easy fix; make two reservations under my name and she'd leave a note that we wanted tables beside each other. Great, I thought. I hung up feeling satisfied that we'd be taken care of. Enter that Saturday night. We ended up being a party of 6 after all, unbeknownst to me until everyone showed up. Big Jones was very busy that night, and when we first arrived, were told that it would be about a half hour before we could be seated. Well, good thing I made that reservation.  An HOUR later, we still had not been seated, even after we saw a table of 6 open up. Guess who was seated there? A party of 4 that had come into the restaurant after us. We were dismayed, and the host (who I later found out was actually a bus boy who had been temporarily moved into that position because they were understaffed that night) blamed it on us for changing our party size from 8 to 6. So we left, giving the host instructions that he should call us if a table opened up. We never got that call, and so gave our business to an establishment down the street.  A day or two later, I emailed Big Jones to let them know of the problem. I got an email back from the owner very quickly who said he would investigate what happened, and that he'd be back in touch with me soon. Well, one day later, he wrote and offered to pay for my entire party's meals if I could convince them to give Big Jones another shot. So two weeks later, my friends and I were able to coordinate our schedules for another Saturday night out. And boy, did Big Jones roll out the red carpet for us. The owner was waiting at the host stand when we arrived, and once our entire party was present, we were seated. We were given a complimentary bottle of champagne to start the evening. We ordered several appetizers, all of which were amazing. And to my relief, everyone was oohing and awing over the food. I also think we were given their best server, and although I don't remember her name, she was awesome. At the end of the meal, I approached the owner who was seated at the bar to thank him for rectifying the situation we had experienced two weeks prior. He was very nice, and said something along the lines of ""If we can't even honor your reservation, we're not doing something right."" I asked him if we could get a check despite the fact that he was paying for our dinner so we'd know what to tip our server. When we were presented with the check, EVERYTHING was zeroed out. We were expecting to at least pay for our alcohol, but everything was taken care of. Needless to say, we tipped our server more than the standard 20%. When we left, I asked everyone what they thought. They all said that they'd come back on their own. So, for that, Big Jones, I thank you. Thank you for turning a wrong into a right, thank you for impressing my friends, and thank you for me being able to continue to patronize your restaurant.

No question that it's New Orleans/Southern inspired by it's great decor and atmosphere. We had a huge group of 14 people to seat for a late reservation. We waited a half hour or so for them to be prepared for such a big group. We literally had to wait for a table to finish before they would seat us. Despite this wait, the staff was warm and polite. At the bar, I asked the bartender for a non alcoholic cocktail, pregnant and all. He created a great herbaceous tonic. It was light, refreshing, and a nice departure from the usual suspects of soda or lemonade.  For dinner, I had the fried chicken (light), skillet cornbread, sampled some pickle tasting plate, and drank a house ginger beer. The chicken was fantastic with its crispy skin and perfectly cooked chicken. Collard greens and a sweet potato hash complemented it. The collards were a little too vinegary for me, but that's more a personal preference. The sweet potatoes were good too.  In general, the meal was pretty tasty. I'll definitely go back to try some of their other fare. For a first taste, I enjoyed my meal, atmosphere, and company.",0.9891,0.802,0.184,0.014,0.5785984848484848

The cocktail list inclines to the South--you can order a Sazerac, a Vieux Carre or a Hurricane. My Sazerac was well made and very tasty, on par with anything you can get in New Orleans, except maybe the one served at the original Sazerac Bar, which serves the best Sazerac anywhere. By contrast, the food is another story. It seems to suffer from the problem of being over salted. I couldn't finish the rutabaga soup for this reason, and the shrimp & grits were also too salty. Now I understand cheesy grits are going to pack a lot of salt, but the kitchen must have added more on top of that. Well, everyone's tolerance for salt is different; for me this food was over the line. Service at the bar was terrific.

We started off poorly again, but then our waiter was very nice and thorough. It was a transition between brunch and dinner which was awkward as well- at around 4pm we were only allowed to order from the brunch menu for 30 min, then after that we could order from the dinner menu.  So we started the meal off with brunch items- but unfortunately were not offered the complimentary beignets which typically comes with brunch I thought.  We got brunch cocktails and food that was great. Then alas we were allowed to order from the dinner menu. We ordered the fried chicken which they tell you up front takes 30min (wished we could have done this when we got there) and it didn't wow me as I had hoped. Another awkward moment with service when our waiter had to leave and switched to a waitress mid-meal but fortunately she was nice and attentive as well.  We had some great wine that was recommended. Then of course had to order the dessert that takes another 30min wait- so we were there for awhile and the dessert didn't blow me away.  All in all at least our experience was better although fraught with awkwardness and we realized we like the brunch food better- so we'd go back for that- especially if they keep up those complimentary beignets!",0.9829,0.763,0.159,0.078,0.6864197530864197

2015-02-23,4.0,"After a tough Friday at work and my weekend off coming up I was stoked to grub on southern cuisine. I am a true Northerner but I definitely appreciate southern fare. As I made my grand entrance in my scrubs no less I realized this place may not like a cool dude in scrubs. Big Jones (BJ) *using BJ throughout this review should be fun* had a very dark casual-intimate appeal to it as it reminded me of the Logan Square bar Analogue. I was expecting a casual-diner type of atmosphere. Kind of like walking into a country bar with your pointy boots and cowboy hat but all you hear is Ludacris and Wu-Tang blaring out the speakers, now realizing you look like an a**hole in your western wear. But I don't like country music anyway...Hmmmm!  Anyway no biggie I carried on. So I was seated at a high-top near the bar and was attended to quickly. If you know me I will most definitely order a cocktail with my dinner, in this case a Distant Star. Now that my friends was an absolutely delicious and refreshing cocktail (Chamomile infused Gin, honey, lemon, mezcal). However for what was a rather small cocktail the $12 price I thought was a little steep for the size and neighborhood. On Mondays all cocktail are half-price that means $6 for some darn good drinks that price point I like. Next comes my food. Fried Chicken (white meat) and Mac & Cheese. Boy let me tell you that Mac & Cheese was straight up gangsta. A strong cheesy flavor but not too salty or creamy, and somewhat caramelized on top, EXACTLY the way I like it. Easily the best Mac & Cheese I have ever had.  BJ's Fried Chicken on the other hand was very ordinary, not bad but ordinary. This does not surprise me as I am notoriously difficult to please when It comes to Fried Chicken. A friend of mine made Fried Chicken at home many years ago and It was the best I've had. No restaurant has ever come close to it. Oh well maybe someday. BJ's wasn't dry but wasn't very moist either and it tasted a little bland. You need some juicy POP in that chicken. Overall BJ's did a number of things very well. The Mac & Cheese was the best everrrrr! A great Distant Star cocktail. Service was very fast and attentive (although you do not need to fill up my water glass every 5 seconds). However the Fried Chicken was a bit dissapointing and the price points were a little high for the neighborhood. I will be back though, probably on Mondays for that Mac & Cheese and half-priced cocktails.  3.8 stars",0.996,0.759,0.174,0.067,0.5344350282485876
2015-02-22,2.0,"Ok. Big Jones, if that is your real name.  I went back here after a long time, hoping for the best.   Now, granted, it was Sunday at 2:30, and pretty crowded (for some reason), but it took our waiter 20 minutes to get our bloody marys. When we finally did receive them, they tasted like they had been triple salted. I searched high and low and finally found the waiter to give my bloody mary back to him.  I was hoping either he or the bartender would taste it and realize that there was a problem.  Instead of admitting any fault, he came back after another 20 minutes and said ""the bartender admits no fault (I'm paraphrasing here) and that is just our recipe'.""  He then paused for 3 minutes and said, ""would you like something else?"" Naturally, I chose something else. The beer list was sadly mediocre and they had no IPAs on draft, nothing from our local powerhouse, Lagunitas.  Ok, getting on with it, the food was not all that. I had the Jones Benedict which was ok, but not worth 13 dollars. One of my group had the biscuits and gravy, which I tried and was terrible.  The biscuit was dry and whole grain with a strange overwhelming herb which was not very good.  The gravy was thin, too. Also, the entrees came out 10 minutes apart, so everything was cold by the time we were able to eat it.  I guess I suggest you find someplace else.  Wishbone has great bloody marys, far better food and is cheaper.  So there you are.

When looking for somewhere to eat for Fat Tuesday and it's already 3pm, you find that options may be limited....or random restaurants are doing Mardi Gras specials that resemble college frat parties. So, even though it was a late reservation, I scored one at Big Jones and visited for my first time. We were a tad early, and the host told us that they didn't have a table ready, or room at the bar, but that we could leave and come back at the time of our reservation.  I asked about nearby options and he directed me to the various spots in the near vicinity.  We elected to visit Calo next door (review pending). Upon our return at exactly our reservation time, they host warmly greeted us and immediately directed us to our table which was waiting.  We scored a great spot near the front windows.  Perfect table in my opinion.  The place was packed, even late during the week, so it was loud and boisterous (and fun!). I admit we had to wait a while for service, and the 4 stars are for the service.  It was really really friendly, but we waited a very long time to be greeted by our server, and then our order was slightly wrong. I also wanted to order a glass of wine during dinner, but no one came by to ask how we were until I was almost done (so I never ordered it).  If I would have been able to catch the eye of our server, I would have tried, but not only could I not find her, but no one else was near enough.  Not a huge deal as it was a weeknight and I didn't really need the wine, but it would have gone great with my pork....  We did alert them to the error on the bill (due to not receiving an item we ordered), and received a piece of cake to go, so that was a nice touch.  I think that they were just super busy due to Mardi Gras so I don't think this is an ongoing issue, but have to say friendly and helpful on the menu, so almost perfect, but not quite. On to the food. wow!   We tried the boudin and then I had the pork sandwich and tried a bite of the crawfish etouffee.  Everything was so delicious.  I can't even describe it - it was like a flavor punch in every bite.  Everything fried was perfectly fried - not greasy and really great flavors.  The sandwich was one of the best pork sandwiches I've had and the ham fat fries - light and delicious.  The etouffee was spicy but really really delicious and had a ton of crawfish in it. Portions were generous and the entire menu looked so good that we couldn't decide what to get.  I can't wait to return for the friend chicken!

Awesome.  1) Food: We ordered the fried green tomatoes, the rye bread plate, and a pot of black-eyed pea and fried hen of the woods mushroom jambalaya to share. The tomatoes were crispy and tart, just right! Even the butter lettuce garnish was obviously extremely fresh (tasted like right out of my garden). The rye was dense, fresh, and perfect, went superbly with the strawberry preserves. The jambalaya had a great kick, and the earthy, funky mushrooms were fried wonderfully, not greasy, but extremely crisp. 5/5.  2) Drink: Ordered an old fashioned: it was a little strong (but then again I'm not really a veteran drinker). The cherry garnish was FANTASTIC, and I'm pretty sure homemade. The drinks' pricing made it pretty unapppealing to order more than one, but the one did hit the spot.   4/5  3) Service: Everyone was extremely prompt, courteous, and professional.

I saw the Check Please episode which talked highly of it so I decided to choose this restaurant for my special celebration. My friend told the staff when he made the reservation about my birthday as well as when he arrived to the host and to our server. I also exclaimed to the server ""I am celebrating my bday!"" My group and I were shocked when my birthday was not acknowledged by a candle on my dessert or anything written on my dish stating happy birthday. To make matters worse, my meal was not good. I had catfish with some shrimps and some cold and dried out hush puppies. My friend commented how I barely ate my meal. I coud not eat it. After all of this, I contacted the management of Big Jones to inform him of the situation. He said he was sorry but wanted more information about what transpired with the communication with the server. I told him all the details of the situation and he just said sorry. He made me feel like we didn't properly tell the server of my bday and never offered me even a complimentary dessert to make up for everything. The managements response was extremely disappointing. I am shocked this person even is a manager. In conclusion, I would never go back to this restaurant. I would tell anyone that is especially having a celebration to go to another restaurant.",0.6907,0.854,0.086,0.06,0.6058646616541352
2015-02-03,2.0,"I had been to Big Jones once before 5 years ago, and suffice it to say, wasn't impressed enough to return, When a group of friends  made a reservation there last weekend,  I decided to be a good sport, and give it another try.  It was ""amateur night ""( Saturday), so I took that into consideration.  Despite our reservation, they were unable to seat us for 30 minutes.  Between the 2 hosts and a man in a kitchen whites ( who may or may not have been the chef) not one of them  offered to help us navigate ordering a drink from the bar.   Frankly, the hosts and  the bar staff looked like deer in headlights.  We finally flagged down the bartender, and placed an order for (2) cocktails.  After 15 minutes,  the bartender had managed to make only one of them. OK, so fast forward, we are finally seated 30 minutes  later.  The man in white offers to comp the cocktails we ordered from the bar.  Only problem is, the bartender still hasn't made  or delivered one of the drinks we originally ordered.  After 30 minutes, our server re-ordered my cocktail and it was delivered .  I've renamed it the ""30 minute Martini"". We pre-ordered fried chicken (while waiting for our late reservation) to circumvent the 30 minute wait listed in the menu.  The chicken was ""OK"" , albeit a little greasy.  We also ordered fried green tomatoes, greens, gumbo and cornbread. By virtue of the fact that they are not ripe,  green tomatoes are always a little firm, but the ones we were served at Big Jones  were hard as rocks....inedible.  The greens were redolent of vinegar, approaching ""tart"" status.   The red beans served with the fried chicken were average, and the gumbo was ample.  The cornbread was highlight of the meal.   So the moral of the story.  If you have spent any time in Louisiana  Big Jones will probably not evoke some of the tremendous Cajun, Creole, or just good old fashioned southern cooking that you are hankering for.",0.904,0.93,0.054,0.015,0.45993055555555556

2015-01-19,2.0,"Lunch today was a disaster. The first time we came here it was good. The cornbread is our favorite and what brings us back. Each time after that first time we went, the food has been inconsistent and at times, inedible.  The last time we came, my fiancé got the hush puppies. They tasted like chalk. Sure enough we cut one open and there was packed, uncooked flour coming out of the hush puppy. Sloppy and, as I said, inedible. The catfish was under salted and flavorless.  But oh the cornbread! So good. Today we gave Big Jones another shot for lunch. The cornbread was dry and dense. Huge disappointment. No sign of the advertised bacon fat anywhere and just very heavy and disappointing.  My fried chicken sandwich came out on what had to have been Sarah Lee $1.39 store bought hamburger buns instead of the Egg Bun described on the menu. It looked sad and miserable. My fried chicken was mostly fried with some chicken in there too. The bun didn't stand a chance. It lasted 2 bites before it was ripped and flat and unappetizing. I also only lasted 2 bites. My red peas and rice looked like it had been on display and everything had solidified by the time it got to me.  As for my poor fiancé, her waffle from her fried chicken and waffles looked pale and sickly. It was mushy and gummy and not very appetizing. Her fried chicken was a completely different color than mine. Curious.  We gave it another shot to cling to the once delicious cornbread. But since that wasn't even good this time, we are done.  I love their gumbo. I will miss you gumbo. One more note. Of the 3+ times we have been an elder man on the staff (same each time) has publicly yelled at a member of the wait staff during service.

I was really excited about Soul Food Week especially since I'm from the South, where what they were calling soul food, is just normal food for us.  We've been to Big Jones before and my wife was less than impressed so I had to do a little pleading to get her to agree to go. The atmosphere and decor at Big Jones is great. Makes me feel like I'm in one of my relative's old Southern homes. And the music playing was great. Our waitress was very attentive, courteous and helpful.  As far as the food goes, we started with the pickle plate which comes with house made white bread. The pickles for the most part was just OK, but the bread was incredible. Almost like cake.  We also got the skillet cornbread, which was really good. It is made with bacon dripping which takes it over the top delicious. For our main courses, I got the smothered pork chop and my wife got the fried chicken.Both were served over a bed of yams and collard greens. I thought that the pork chop was way too salty and kind of tough. The yams were great, but the collard greens were too vinegary for my liking. My wife let me try her chicken wing and it was amazing!! Very crunchy and flavorful. We also got the fried okra to share which was really good For dessert, we shared the skillet peach cobbler. The peaches themselves were a bit too tart, but the topping was phenomenal. Total tab with tip was $100 which was a bit pricey for what we ordered, but I went in knowing roughly how much the tab would be. Overall, I would recommend Big Jones to anyone who wants to have amazing fried chicken in a great environment.

I went for a 1230 brunch yesterday and there was a long line of people waiting inside & outside. I was very happy to have saved us some time plus we got a nice little 2 top right next to the window and away from most of the bustle of the restaurant. Once we were sat, we were immediately greeted and brought water. Our server was very friendly, very quick and very attentive. He quickly took our order and we were brought the beignets everyone raves about. I wondered why our menus were covered in powdered sugar and after getting these little bad boys, I understood why. They were doused in the soft sugary fluff. They were so flaky on the outside with soft centers, even a bit gooey which I loved. They were quite delicious and filling! We got three for the table but each indulged in just one. Before going to Big Jones, I looked through the food pron. Food pron really gets me going and the photo of the Big Jones Benedict put me towards the edge. I knew I was getting that before going in. It just called my name. When it was placed in front of me, I knew I made the right decision. It was two halves of a biscuit, each with a poached egg, huge chunks of perfectly done ham and doused in Kilgus Farmstead cream. The entire biscuit was just drenched in the cream~~~mmmmmm! The eggs benedict took up about half the plate and the other half was filled with Potatoes O'Brien. The portion was so big after having had a beignet that I could only eat about half of it. Not bad for $13.  Big Jones is part of A La Card, too, so we got $10 off our final bill.

2014-11-10,2.0,"My husband and I  saw great reviews of Big Jones on Check Please so we decided to go there for Sunday dinner. The reviewers all bragged about how friendly this place was, southern hospitality and great food. We  didn't have the same experience.  THE SERVICE:  The hostess greeted us and that was about it.  We sat at a table that had a broken top that flopped up and almost hit me in the face.  A guy came to fill our glasses with water - no greeting, no acknowledgement, NOTHING.  Before I could tell him about the table he was gone.  A waitress (Allison)  served the table behind us.  She looked over at us, but quickly turned away when I made eye-contact. So, I assumed she wasn't our waitress.  WRONG.  After waiting almost 10 minutes, Allison came over and asked us what we wanted to drink. On the menu it reads ""allow 30 minutes for fried chicken.""  So, I told Allison I wanted to go ahead and order the fried chicken because it takes longer and I was hungry.  Then, I asked her how long does the corn bread take and she said 10 minutes.  So, I placed a corn break order and told her since I was hungry I'd like to get the cornbread as soon as possible.  We then told her about the broken table.  She said she would take care of it right away.  She didn't.  Allison brought our drinks and I asked her not to put it on the table because the table pops up on one side.  She then said she forgot to fix the table and searched for a new table.  At that point, I just sensed she wasn't connecting with us.   Then, about 10 minutes later my fried chicken dinner arrived.  I was glad, but shocked because the menu said 30 minutes.  The cornbread was no where in sight.  I asked about the cornbread and  Allison said it was ready and she just needed to bring it.  WHAT??? I told her I thought that would come out first and she insisted that it was ready she just needed to bring it out.  She wasn't getting it - she really wasn't connecting or tuned in to us AT ALL. THE FOOD:  Not impressed at all.  The fried chicken tasted like fish and I soon figured out they cooked the chicken in the same oil (grease) that they cooked the fish.  That is a BIG NO NO in the south.  And wasn't this southern cooking?  The fried chicken was ok, but I kept thinking, I paid $12 for a thigh & leg.  And the half chicken was $25 so I didn't dare order that. $25 for 4 pieces of chicken - REALLY? The collard greens were HORRIBLE.  They were extremely salty with too much vinegar.  The only thing I liked was the sweet potato hash, which was odd because I don't like sweet potatoes.  I only ordered them because my husband wanted them - and he didn't like them.  They were finely diced with bacon and brown sugar.  A true sweet potato lover will not like this dish because it's too finely diced. My  husband ordered the pork shoulder sandwich - again, horrible.  He said there was so much vinegar that it ruined the taste of the meat.  And the sandwich was small. He liked the fries. SOUTHERN COOKING:  I soon realized the chef thinks overly seasoned food means southern cooking. WRONG. A good cook uses seasoning to bring out the flavor of the food.  This place drowns their food in seasoning to the point where you can barely swallow it.  The fried chicken seasoning was good, but it tasted like fish.  And the portions were small.  Southern cooking usually means generous portions.  My husband's pork sandwich wasn't overflowing with meat and the taste was awful. Because of the bad service and poorly prepared food, we couldn't wait to leave this place.   And I kept thinking perhaps Anthony Bourdain was right when he said never eat at a restaurant on a Sunday because that's the chefs off day.  And this place was OFF.",0.9948,0.783,0.146,0.071,0.5591805813234384

So I saw this place about a month ago and decided to go for my birthday.  I was highly disappointed, especially waiting so long. Not so much in the food but the prices. Very pricey - fried chicken dinner was $21 as well as the fish. Two people at my table ordered the fried fish dinner and both were disappointed.  First, they were skimpy on the fish portion and it tasted bland. Pretty surprising since New Orleans style is spicy. They were skimpy on the greens also. My Uncle had to ask for some type of sauce for the fish. My sister and boyfriend ordered the burger. I tried my boyfriends burger which was good, however they did not ask how they wanted it cooked and my sisters was rare which she does not like at all.  For me, I had the shrimp and grits which was good, but nothing crazy. Skimpy on the shrimp of course. Most of all I was surprised they charged $5 a plate for a cake my family bought me. $5 to cut a piece of cake! You've got to be kidding me. Anyways,  we ended up taking the cake back to the house.  Oh yea, and for such a ""fancy"" place in regards to their ridiculous prices, they could at least serve bread while we waited for our food. Overall, I was disappointed in the prices, portions, and lack of flavors. Our waitress was very nice. It wasn't her fault regarding pricing. The decor was very nice and intimate.

2014-10-06,4.0,We've been to Big Jones for brunch once and dinner twice. It's not some place we can afford to go to very often but when we want truly delicious southern comfort food and some whiskey/bourbon this is the place we'll make a reservation for. I've always had a reservation and I'm not sure it will be easy to get in without one unless it is weekday lunches. The atmosphere is casual but still feels like a nice night out. I had the special this time which was hog collar and was seriously one of the most delicious things I have eaten in a very long time (imagine corned beef texture with the flavor of lightly candied bacon) but my husband's catfish was amazing too; very crispy and really battered in corn meal - not flour with a little corn meal added. Also his grits and greens were such a perfect balance of flavors. We also had some bourbon with dinner and although they have an extensive list there are no descriptions of the bourbons and we spent a lot of the beginning of our meal looking up the menu on our phones. Our waitress tried to make a good suggestion but I have to admit the easy sipper I was given was more of a mixer and not that good neat. That is the only reason I held off on giving a 5 star review.

They are doing their job, neither detracting or adding to the experience. My absolute favorite dish here can only be had as a special on Easter brunch. The chicken fried lamb is amazing. I love lamb, and this southern take on it is flavorful and different enough to make it stand out from all the other braised lamb offerings at other restaurants. Also, I highly recommend the pozole, which is a stew with red chile, hominy, pork, onions, and cabbage. The chef does a really tasty take on this traditional Mexican dish. Usually, when grandma makes it you have to squeeze your own lime in for flavor. The chef prepares the pork so well that you don't need to add any. You taste the lime in the pork and it's elevates this dish, along with the wonderfully fresh red chile stew. If you are a fan of pozoles, this will excite and delight you.

I opted for the onion and bacon omlette withe grits on the side (the other option was potatoes).  My friend got a decadant pancake plate that could easily double as a dessert (no judgment - just description).  My omlette tasted good, but it was either weeping (watery) or the onions inside were weren't quite dry.  The big miss for me were the veneer of grits.  While they tasted ok, there was hardly three bites in the schmear that was slid across my plate.  Seriously, it was about an ounce, if that.  I get that higher end food doesn't align itself with huge portions, but come on.  They're grits.   A+ on the coffee though.  The service was nice, attentive and friendly.  I don't think I can recommend Big Jones as without reservation as I once did.  More like Medium Jones.",0.9832,0.804,0.154,0.042,0.44823863636363626

2014-08-31,5.0,"I'm in love with Big Jones after visiting for the first time last week. Where to start...the service, the food, the atmosphere... Okay, the food. No, really, the FOOD. I tried the fired green tomatoes, corn bead, chicken and dumplings, and a bit of a friend's pimiento cheese burger. The fried green tomatoes were perfect: Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, generously sized, and covered in yummy sauce and pickled relish. The cornbread will become my new go-to comfort food in Chicago. It's cooked in its own cast iron skillet and is everything my grandma's cornbread always wished it could be. (Sorry grandma.) You can taste the bacon fat it's cooked in, and the green onions add a nice bit of spice. Even without the perfectly sweetened honey butter, the cornbread stays moist and perfect, but that doesn't mean you should skip the butter. The pimiento cheese was great, and I'll be back to try it as an appetizer with crackers. The burger was ginormous and could easily feed two people, especially since the home fries are also generously served. My chicken and dumplings were good, not amazing and pale in comparison to the bread and tomatoes, but good. The broth was a bit too watery for my tastes, and the dumplings were a tad on the doughy side.  The service was just as amazing as the food. Drinks were filled promptly and the timing of the courses was perfect. The server wiped down the table and brought new silverware between appetizers and dinner, which added a nice touch. The waitress and the busser were both very nice, and answered any questions we had.  I also appreciated the drink menu, which features a good selection of bourbon.  We sat on the patio, and it was quiet and lovely;  a nice get away tucked out of the way in bustling Andersonville.

2014-08-31,2.0,"I came here with my girlfriend Sunday morning after discovering a long line at Bongo Room and Over Easy. I almost decided on Golden House since its delicious, quick and easy, but was in the vicinity of Big Jones so I went there. That was a mistake that'll live in infamy.  As we came in I remembered I had taken my mom to Big Jones on Mother's day and paid way too much for our underwhelming meals. I decided to go against my memories, which are usually muddled by years of drinking, and choose to sit on the patio. It would have been nice to be told by the host that the patio umbrellas were broken by a recent Chicago-style monsoon but that was just an oversight, I guess. Forgetting our sun screen, we asked for a different table but that just served to have a different side of our face burned.  So as we sat baking in the sun we noticed that there was a larger amount of flies, bees, and moths than average in our vicinity. Quickly, my girlfriend's astute olfactory organs picked up the smell of garbage, which while usually delightful, isn't conducive to a proper brunch, generally. Apparently, the patio is close to the alley/local landfill. We hoped that the meal would make up for the lack of suitable ambience but this was only half true. My girlfriend ordered the, as she said, Big Jones Juicy Eggs (Big Jones Benedict after further inquiries), and I ordered the Buckwheat Banana Pancakes. Our meals came out with free NAHLINS-style beignets, which were quite delicious.  Being slightly obese, I always eat my meal and portions of my girlfriend's.. and this time was no different. The food was presented very nicely and I have to give kudos for this fact. Only downer is that right after being served our waitress was yelled at by who I can only imagine was her abusive boyfriend/chef, luckily she laughed it off so our worries quickly dissipated. Also, my pancakes were smothered in salty caramel sauce which made it almost inedible, which is also an abuse of sorts. We inhaled our meals in effort to ward off skin cancer and quickly left. TL;DR summary:  Sun in face. Patio smell and infested. My girlfriend's meal was delish. My meal was not. Sad waitress. Left in a hurry.

My party and I consisted of a total of 5 people were seated right away for an early weekend dinner. 15 min. Later we finally got a server to take our drink order.  The Bourbon selection was quite impressive. I was the only one in my party that felt I had to sample one of the 30 plus bourbons. My drink came with a long wait again for service, and my drink was less than a shot with one ice cube melting in the glass.  My party and I decided to start with the pickle tasting, as I'm a sucker for good pickles. The starter came with one tiny pickle slice and other veggies pickled not very good. All the picked veggies tasted the same.  Then finally the main course an hour later. I decided on the pork shoulder sandwich with fries.  My wife ordered the Creole Noddles with seafood.  My pork shoulder was just ok, lacking pork in between the buns, reminded me of sandwich you might get at a street fair. The fries were subpar, my dish had a side of very watered down ranch dressing, I'm guessing for the fries?

2014-08-18,4.0,"My girlfriend and I stopped by for late lunch while visiting Chicago. As a native of New Orleans, I like to bravely try out restaurants' attempts to recreate my origin's local fare. Overall, the food here was well done.  For starters, we split the ""pickles"", and enjoyed all the different options. The oddest on the tray were the pickled strawberries, but still surprisingly good.  Everything seemed to have the same flavoring of pickling which was slightly a bummer.  We split a couple other things , the pea falafel salad, the ya-ya gumbo, and the smothered okra. Of the three, the gumbo is the one thing I would not recommend. The roux was very dark and a bit underseasoned. The falafel was really tasty and unique. I think it is actually made with black-eyed peas, very creative. The smothered okra was a bit slimy, but tasted good.  New Orleans food is still better, but for being so far away from the source, I'd still recommend checking it out.",0.9153,0.777,0.144,0.079,0.4997878787878789
2014-08-16,1.0,"Went there for brunch on Saturday using a reservation. Seated immediately, not very busy. The food was tasty but the service was downright AWFUL.  It took 10 minutes for our waitress to get to our table to even take our drink order and I would have forgiven this had I not seen her just standing back by the drink refill station talking to other workers the entire time. After she took our drink order, it was another 10 minutes before I had to actually stop her and ask her to take our order. I've been a waitress for many years and under no circumstances should you ever have to ask your waitress to come take your order.  After our order was taken, we NEVER saw the waitress again the whole time we were there. She never returned to our table to refill our drinks/coffee or to ask if we needed anything. The most irritating part about this was watching her stand at the hostess stand talking to the hostess instead of helping us or completely ignoring us when she walked by our table. The place isn't that big so we could see her ignoring us every time she walked by us. When we finished our meal, she never even returned to give us our check. I had to ask another waiter for our bill and then even he returned to our table with an attitude and shoved a small receipt in front of my face asking if this was my order and how i wanted to pay. Once again the most irritating part about this was watching our waitress stand in the doorway between the front and back dining areas and DO NOTHING. I'm not sure if she was having a bad day or not but that service was inexcusable. You don't charge $15 a plate for brunch and then give the CRAPPIEST SERVICE EVER. We will not be returning here which is sad because I was so excited to go here in the first place and that awful waitress put us off of the place forever. I've never had service so bad, not even at the $5 breakfast place by our house. GET IT TOGETHER BIG JONES!

THE GOOD: The fried chicken was fantastic, heavily seasoned, moist, with a crunchy cornmeal crust, and some of the best I've had in Chicago. The shrimp and grits were also amazing, the best I've had outside of Louisiana. The tete de cochon (pig head pate) was quite good, but a very rustic version that squeamish eaters might not enjoy. The bartender also made a great Sazerac. THE BAD: The Brussels sprouts were overly salted and undercooked but were still edible. The biscuits on the other hand, were pathetic. They were dense, dry and tasted more of leavening than anything else. They were also really tiny for the price. I found it really odd that the biscuits could be so bad when they did everything else so well.  Overall, a very good meal and we will be back for the grits and the chicken.

2014-08-06,3.0,"The hubby and I have been meaning to get to this place ever since we relocated from Atlanta two years ago. We finally gave it a whirl. Pretty good, but I agree with other readers that it is slightly inconsistent. First let me get this out of the way: We both know Southern cooking. He spent his undergrad years in Baton Rouge, so you can't fool him on the Cajun. I grew up in North Carolina and love to cook anything Southern. It is how I learned to cook, where I learned to cook, and I still use recipes I have modified from some of the greats of the South, including the now media-damaged Paula Deen, who can still cook her butt off. I was excited to see several Southern faves on the menu. The delivery was good on several things, but where the restaurant missed, it missed badly. My first concern was upon ordering my Hurricane. Hurricanes are a very delicate drink to successfully execute for any bartender. I was trying to decide between the Hurricane and The Chatham Artillery Punch, to which, to his credit, the server tried to steer me. I asked him, several times however, which drink was sweeter. He evaded the simple answer, almost as if that would have been insulting to either drink. He used all of the catch phrases needed to sidestep my question, but I would have thought more highly of his knowledge had he just answered my direct question. Sometimes you just want a sweet drink, or not, and do not care if the drink in question, is ""light, crisp, refreshing, momentous.""  Hurricanes require balance to be successful; otherwise, they taste like $10 cough syrup. I will just say mine was not successful in its balance. We ordered Fried Green Tomatoes and Pimento Cheese for appetizers. Fried Green Tomatoes are a favorite of both of us, and the hubby had never had Pimento Cheese, which is one of my favorite recipes to make. (He is very picky and has never eaten my recipe when I've prepared it.) The tomatoes were very well done, sauced appropriately as well. Very good dish. The Pimento Cheese was more disappointing. Pimento Cheese should be creamy, not diced. It's all about how finely you grate or shred the ingredients and blend them together. Ours was more like some diced pimentos and cheddar cheese that had been diced and stirred together, not blended, although the menu introduces them as ""blended."" It also did not have a lot of flavor of seasonings that usually make this Southern favorite amazing. I understand food deconstruction and taking a dish and making it all your own, but sometimes when you do that you vary too much from the original, and you let your fans down. I would not order it again. For our entrees, the hubby got the baby back ribs special, and I did the Savannah fish fry from the regular menu. The ribs were awesome! Perfectly seasoned, they should be a regular on the menu. The side of okra was incredible as well; the okra was in a tomato sauce but was still not slimy, as some okra can be. The fish fry was very disappointing. The batter on the fish wasn't impressive, and the fish itself was a little tough and rubbery. The grits were good, as were the greens, the oyster gravy was okay, but the hush puppies were bad. Hush puppies should be light and not dense, and these were too ""meal-y"" and heavy. The hubby, a big, big fan of hush puppies, took one bite and didn't finish it. The heaviness made the texture too much like paste. Regrettably, we passed up dessert, because the hubby wanted frozen yogurt. Yes, I was mad at him for that. We will just have to return for those. I don't think this is a bad place at all. It's just hard to pass off Southern dishes to Southerners who take their eats seriously. Perhaps they are trying to put a spin on some traditional staples, but don't stray too far. Those of us who know better will call you out on it. It's definitely worth a second, or third, visit, but they are inconsistent, and I hope they get those things figured out.",0.9979,0.769,0.166,0.065,0.5131413308913308

Patio was nice, bit loud with the driveway and would be improved if the pumped in music from inside. All in all, pleasant experience but few points for why it got a 3 out of 5.  Service was very slow. Our waitress was very nice and pleasant and I think she was a bit overwhelmed with tables, so I understand that. However, as we received our entrees, I ordered a 2nd cocktail. Finished our meal and still hadn't received my drink. Asked the waitress to cancel my drink order and as she was walking in, my drink walked out. Either way, staff was very friendly but just a bit slow and tended to be MIA for periods of time and had to flag them down anytime we needed something. Food was decent; the voodoo greens were awesome and the fried chicken was great and crispy. We started with the pimiento cheese and the fried green tomatoes- both very good but could have used more crackers for the cheese. Also ordered the corn bread which i could have eaten just that and the fried chicken, little doughy in the middle but I like that. For our entrees, I ordered the fish fry- which was good, but needed a bit more spice or something to round out the flavor profile. The hush puppies were pretty bland and dry but the grits were very good. My boyfriend got the fried chicken which was awesome, bit salty for me but good.  Cocktails...not worth the price. Bit too much lemon and not enough punch. Could be better but maybe it's just what we ordered- who knows.

Both of us don't have any experience with real southern food so we weren't really sure what to expect.  Our waiter was nice. There was this dish on the menu, Fried Sweetbread Waffles (I think that's what it was called...can't remember the actual name) and my cousin and I couldn't figure out what sweetbread was. We thought it might be similar to chicken and waffles but it wasn't. We asked our waiter who tried to explain to us that sweetbread was some meat from the neck of some animal that gets fried. In hindsight, we could've googled it but my cousin decided to be adventurous and ordered that. I order the Big Jones Benedict with a side of buttered grits. I had amazing grits before and wanted to see if this would be good too.  Our waiter started us off by bringing some beignets. My cousin and I were confused because we didn't ordered it but soon guessed that they were probably complimentary since other tables were getting them as well. The beignets were really good. I could've ate a dozen plates of those. My Big Jones Benedict was delicious. I'd skip the butter grits though. It wasn't terrible but I had better. My cousin's sweetbread waffles was a different story. We were worried about how the sweetbread would taste and it turned out to be delicious. The waffle though...not so much. The waffle was mushy and I can't explain the flavor but it was not tasty at all. When our waiter came by and asked how things were, we were honest and said that everything tasted good except for the waffles. It had an off flavor and we couldn't tell if that's just how it's suppose to be (some weird spice maybe?) or if it was maybe the greens that were on top of the waffle that caused that weird flavor. The waiter was nice and asked if we would like something else but we declined as we didn't feel too optimistic to try anything else. When our bill came, the waiter gave us 50% off the sweetbread waffles since we didn't like it. We were surprised by that and to be honest, I was going to cross this place off for future visits.

My catfish (circa 1910? seriously? though I do not take off points for pretension, I COULD) was basically flavorless, and worse, my hushpuppies were FULLY RAW INSIDE. My husbands salmon was a tiny piece of salmon with like, 2 potatoes and a few carrots strewn around the plate. Our companions (the pork dish and the shrimp & grits) were equally unexcited by their dishes. No one cleaned their plate. Everything was just a little too bland and greasy for me. I know people always perceive southern food as being really heavy and fried, but having grown up in the south and eaten the best food of my life there, Southern food shines because of the bounty of fresh produce that southerners have access to. We like tons of vegetables, well-seasoned meats and fish, and lots of ice in our drinks. I guess I was looking for southern, and this place was ""southern,"" if that makes any sense.  I'd be happy to come back for the fried chicken, but I just can't get behind the rest of the menu.",0.9962,0.726,0.214,0.059,0.5045008183306056

Fry dough, coat in powdered sugar, and give it to me for free? Yeah, you get the extra half star. Entered up splitting the corn griddle cakes, the french toast and a side of the fried plantains. I though the corn griddle cakes and french toast would be an odd side-by-side pairing but in fact the griddle cakes were a tad sweeter than I expected and the french toast not quite as much. The cornflour lend a sweetness that was balanced by the cheddar cheese baked in side and the tomato sauce. I actually thought the tomato sauce was sweeter than it was spicy but again this helped the french toast pairing. The french toast was light and coconut-y with a banana anglaise and rhubarb sauce pairing that added just the right amount of sweetness. This wouldn't be a dish I'd want by itself for lunch but as a shared plate it was just right. Fried plantains? Pretty good and I loved the honey it was served in.

Texture was an issue with my companion's shrimp & grits, as well: some of the shrimp were mushy and some had an off flavor. Key lime pie had a tasty filling in an unremarkable crust. Cappuccino had nice flavor, though it was too mild for me (possibliy because it was served in a 12oz mug?).

It works in the way simple things done well do. As far as drinks, the selection is pretty extensive.

I made a reservation via Open Table on Saturday for brunch at 12:15 on Sunday. When we arrived (on-time), we were informed there was a wait for a table.  We've been to brunch before in Chicago, so we get that it's busy and a scene. But I've never before waited 20+ minutes for a table WITH a reservation with no apology or compensation.  Once we were sat, we felt rushed through our meal. Items kept getting cleared immediately during our meal, including plates and drink glasses (including water) not completely empty. Towards the end of our meal, instead of being offered coffee or dessert, we were instead told that they were setting up for a large top, and asked if a table could be abutted to our table, the staff put the table against ours. The message by this point was received. The food was OK, minus dry pancakes. To our waiter's credit, he came back after our credit cards were processed to see of anything had been amiss during our dining experience. We did not bring any of what I wrote to his attention, as we felt uncomfortable after our experience. To his credit, he did charge my husband for only one of his two orange juices.

We then shared the fried chicken, with a side of sweet potato hash and a cornbread skillet.  The fried chicken (we ordered the half size) was perfect for sharing.  It was very juicy, and the breading was great.  The hash...oh the hash.  I'm still thinking about it.  The cornbread skillet was also everything I was dreaming of. For dessert, we shared a lemon pie.  It was more of a tart, and came with caramel ice cream.  It was good, but honestly didn't compare to the other parts of the meal.

There's nothing like digging into a large platter of hot, crispy, delicious fried chicken on cold winter night.  The skin had an indescribable texture that made a wonderful crunching noise when peeling it off the meat and biting down into it.  The chicken was juicy, tender, and flavorful.  My mouth is watering just remembering how it tastes.  Hubby had the chicken and dumplings, which were also good, but nothing beats the fried chicken.  The pimento cheese was a great way to start the meal.  They also served genuinely sweet, sweet tea!  I actually had to water mine down a bit with some ice, just the way I like it. The decor matched the Southern comfort food menu.  I loved the hardwood floors, dim lighting, and high-back dining chairs, which reminded me of many restaurants in my former state of NC.  Service was great.  Our server was quiet, but friendly.  He answered our questions about the menu and portions, and helped us pick between dishes since we wanted to try many.  Unfortunately, they did get rid of offering the family style dinners, aka a flat rate per person for fried chicken and a choice of several sides.  That would have been a great way to sample the sides.",0.9929,0.804,0.168,0.028,0.6236319966583124

Lastly, M adored the tantalizing and crisp exterior of her fried chicken but was bored by the chicken itself. I was assured that the shrimp and grits at Big Jones was legendary; however, it did nothing for either myself or M.

2013-12-01,2.0,"This review is strictly in response to their Thanksgiving day program, a prix fixe menu that was priced at $45 per person. I feel compelled to write this review because of how underwhelming it all was, from the very beginning.  First of all, $45 per person was low compared to the other offerings in the city, but ultimately very, very high for the quality of the final product and the overall experience. For starters, the waitstaff seemed quite pained that evening. I hate writing reviews based on service because I was a waitress for a few years and know how thankless the job can be. But holy bojangles, our waitress couldn't wait to get us out of there, she looked so depressed and defeated.  In response to the food, it was also generally very underwhelming. About as sad as our waitress, I would say. The bread, butter and jam combination was nice but that was as good as the starter got. It contained a number of pickled vegetables and fruits, beer cheese and olives. Sounds good in theory, but none of it really stood out.   We ordered the fried turkey main course, which came with cranberries and giblet gravy. Again, all very tempting in theory but literally every single item on both of our plates was cold. Okay, not icy to the touch but somewhere below room temperature? Also mildly depressing. The turkey was dry, and I didn't get any skin so there was virtually no discernible difference between it and normal, roasted turkey. Where was the fried part? This main course was also accompanied by a roasted vegetable dish (green beans and brussels sprouts) served family style, which would have been good had they been hot. Or even warm. They weren't. The green beans were quite cold, wet and firm. They needed something--please see the the green bean dish at Girl & the Goat. The dessert was just okay. I normally vacuum dessert off of my plate because I'm gross, but I don't know. I couldn't and I didn't. With two glasses of wine, my boyfriend and I spent close to $130. I could have eaten like a KING for $130 at Longman & Eagle or Tanta or Ruxbin or Yusho or The Bristol. I feel like this is the saddest story I've ever Yelped. You win some, you lose some, right?

My brother does not care for chicken so we asked the waiter if she and I could have the chicken and just to pretend he was not at our table and allow him to order something else. The waiter said NO. The whole table must order the chicken. And we said really?, can't you make an exception?, and he said no, but I can offer you the dinner portion which is a half chicken with two sides for $20. We point out it is less food at a higher price. And he says something about giving us some time to come to a decision. So we decide to get chicken sandwiches instead. Next part is my brother asks if he can have some bread for the side for his dish which is a soupy grits and shrimp. The waiter looks perplexed. And my brother said again is it possible to get some bread, which most restaurants do offer. The waiter comes back with 4 half slices of toast with a jam and butter and we are charged $4 for the bread. As a server he should have said sorry we don't have dinner bread you are accustomed to as a side but we do have this bread on the menu. But he didn't, he just brought the bread and charged us.

Buckwheat pancakes, despite being covered in syrup and goo, were not too sweet, and had a toothsome texture.  Fried boudin sausages and grits were both outstanding -- some of the best examples I have ever had of each.  Our waiter vanished so quickly that I did have to steal some salt from a nearby table, though.

Either I'm ordering the wrong thing at brunch or am a total wimp, but their brunch is just too rich for me. I've ordered both the Biscuits and Debris Gravy and the Bayou Teche, the latter of which was sooooo rich and intense I could hardly eat a quarter of it. Both dishes were very tasty, great flavors but much too rich for me, maybe I should stop ordering things covered in gravy ... that's a thought.  Regardless, what I really enjoy about Big Jones are their sandwiches. I have had their South Carolina Shrimp Burger (yes actual real shrimp chopped up and pressed into a magical burger patty) and their Smoked and Smothered Pork Shoulder Sandwich, the latter being my favorite of the two. If you like a little spicy and vinegar-y pulled pork then this is the sandwich for you. Their pickled veg slaw is awesome, gives the sandwich a real kick and their pork its just delicious. I love sour and spice and pork so this is kind of the greatest sandwich ever. Both sandwiches come with pretty tasty thick cut beef fat fries and some sort of buttermilk dipping sauce. Apparently when I was at Big Jones last my man and my mom weren't that impressed with the fries and sauce. I have no complaints, salty fries and cooling buttermilk dip, yes please.  On our last visit my father (fellow yelper Jon T) had their evening special, Turkey Etouffee. From what I sampled it was crazy delicious and I could tell he really enjoyed it. I look forward to trying their specials and branching out from their dinner sandwiches.

2013-10-29,4.0,"Ms T and I made a pilgrimage to Chicago to visit KT.  On our first night four of us went to Big Jones for dinner.  KT and B had been there before and liked what they had.  It features Cajun influenced and Southern food.  This always sounds good to me. I started with Gumbo Ya-Ya.  It had almost a black roux with andouille, chicken and pork.  For as dark as the roux was, I expected more roux flavor, but it was good.  When roux is that dark, it can get a little bitter, which I detected.  I think it would have benefitted from more holy trinity to add a very slight hint of sweetness.  I did not detect any andouille in my serving and found the meats to be a little dried out.  I would like to see them move this to a seafood gumbo.  Nevertheless, it was better than virtually all gumbo I have had in St Louis.  It was served with Arkansas aromatic rice.  This is the first time I have eaten domestic aromatic rice and did not find it aromatic like jasmine or basmati, but I liked the brown rice-like chewiness.  It works well with brown roux based dishes. Ms T and B had the Shrimp Burger.  They both really liked the rich shrimp flavors of the patty.  They over applied the homemade, slightly spicy, mayonnaise which made it gooey and difficult to pick up.  Both Ms T and B pretty much gave up and ate the shrimp cake and left the soggy bun.  This is a minor issue for a very flavorful sandwich in the South Carolina style. KT revisited the Smoked Pork Shoulder sandwich and shared a couple of tangy bites with me.  This is excellent, topped with a vinegar slaw.  I overwhelmingly prefer vinegar based barbecue on pulled and chopped pork.  This one was very good.  It is really nice to get pork in the Midwest without the super sweet sauce.  It was supposed to be another South Carolina style with mustard based sauce.  I did not really detect the mustard as I have experienced in South Carolina, but I would order this any time. I ordered a special of the night, Turkey Etouffe.  This was a clear winner.  The roux was lighter, more of a red-brown with great flavor.  It was buttery and rich, served with the same Arkansas rice.  The turkey comprised pieces of leg and thigh meat that was juicy, tender and flavorful.  Seasoning was very good with just the right amount of herbs.  Again, I can't find Cajun food I like in St Louis.  The best I have had was heavy handed with the use of thyme.  Not so at Big Jones.  I enjoyed this greatly and would compare it to a Chef Paul Prudhomme recipe that we make in our family regularly. Based on testing three menu items and one off-menu item, Big Jones is doing a great job with some gut warming traditional southern dishes.  I was impressed with the seasoning and balance which indicates that the chef not only knows what to use in a dish, but also how much.",0.9987,0.769,0.204,0.027,0.5217066544566545

2013-10-13,4.0,"The boyfriend and I had the boarding house lunch.  There was a TON of food, and it was delicious!  We made a valiant effort, but still had a lot of food left on the table.  I would suggest either skipping breakfast or getting a humongous bag of leftovers.  Sadly, we were going to be out and about for the rest of the day, without access to a fridge. The boarding house lunch included: - Biscuits and cornbread with homemade preserves and whipped butter - yum, I could not get enough of the biscuits and the preserves - Fried chicken - from the website: ""Cooked according to Edna Lewis's recipe in fresh leaf lard with butter and a ham hock, in a cast iron kettle.""  I did not realize that the chicken was fried in lard.  That explains why this chicken was so ridiculously crispy, addictive, greasy, and filling.  (We ate lunch at 11 am and felt uncomfortably full for the rest of the day.  A day of walking around did not make us hungry enough for our 5 pm dinner...)  Of course, the breast pieces were the weakest link.  Pretty dry and probably would have benefited from a dunk in the gravy.  I skipped the white meat and instead attacked the drumstick, thigh, and wing.  The dark meat was definitely where it was at.  I am usually not a chicken wing fan (all skin and bones...), but this one was delicious.  I will not eat chicken skin unless it's perfectly fried to a crisp, and of course this chicken skin was perfect.  Note: grease will get all over your plate, table, napkin, hands, and mouth... I probably should have gotten a beverage other than water to help cut the grease.  If the server was grossed out by me, he was kind enough to hide his disgust.  But then, he also had a greased-up hipster mustache.   - Mashed potatoes and gumbo gravy - I thought these were ok, not the greatest, not the worst.  The boyfriend liked them better than I did.  I didn't eat very much of them in order to eat MORE CHICKEN. - Voodoo greens - pretty good and a much-needed counterpoint to all of the lard. - Red beans and rice - also pretty tasty and another break from the greasiness. - Banana pudding for dessert - yum!  A fairly light, not humongous, and tasty end to the meal.  The pudding contained sliced bananas, whipped cream, and was topped with some coconut flakes.

Sunday at 9am with a reservation and you get an open and airy dining experience with jives well with the whole polished plantation look they have goin' on here.

There are free beignets (like table bread). So if you're one of those ""Sweet or savory? Sweet or savory?"" internally conflicted diners, weight yourself towards savory.

2013-08-22,2.0,"I wish I understood why Big Jones is so popular. I've tried it a couple of times and find the food very challenging. On my most recent visit to Big Jones, I tried the Fried Chicken Dinner for $25. You have to have at least two people, full table participation and a big appetite to order this. So, for two of us we were in for $50. For $50 we received a plate of thinly sliced stale rye bread, a small platter of pickled things (including a few strands of pickled asparagus, three tiny pickled strawberries (?), three brown things that looked like week old apricot pits, and a glob of pimento cheese floating in pickle juice), then a plate with three cornbread muffins and a scoop of butter, after a 15-20 pause we received two plates of fried chicken (each plate had a breast, thigh and leg) a small portion of mashed potatoes and gravy, some cooked greens, a small biscuit which resembled hard-tack (aka pirate food) and after a few more minutes one bowl of red beans topped with an ice cream sized scoop of rice. You don't have to have eaten a lot of Southern food, or any really, to know that this is not good food. The meal finishes with banana pudding. Of all that food, the cornbread muffins and the banana pudding were the best things. The rest of it was flavorless at best, off-putting at its worst.  Big Jones has one of the prettiest dining rooms in Andersonville. I wish they had the food to go with it.  One tip: skip the patio.

Obviously that wasn't going on then but the menu looked intriguing. The restaurant wasn't really full at all (we came around 6 on a weekday), and we were promptly seated. We ended up ordering the pork shoulder sandwich, the fried green tomatoes, and the fried clams, plus two drinks (Artillery House Punch, the other one was gin based and had lavender/honey...just can't remember the name). Drinks were strong and well made. We both agreed that the sandwich was the favorite of our dishes -- pretty darn amazing and a (relative) steal at $13. The meat packs a lot of heat, the vinegar slaw was excellent, and the accompanying handful fries (which are more like jojos) were surprisingly crispy. The fried green tomatoes were kind of underwhelming (five half slices at $12?) but were surprisingly filling -- we found the accompanying paste to be a little too rich. Finally, fried clams were solid -- the flavor of the aioli was bright, and in fact we're hoping to reverse engineer it for our own gatherings. You will get some cornbread at the beginning of the meal and to be honest, we were a little underwhelmed -- the texture was good but there's not really much flavor.  The ambience and service straddles a fine line between precious and too precious, so take that as you will (i.e. they list the dates of recipes on the menu, we were told each ""element"" of the meal).

2013-06-02,5.0,"As much as I love Big Jones, I had never paid much attention to their sandwiches until I read items about their pimento cheese burger almost simultaneously in TimeOut and Chicago magazines.  The praise piqued my interest, and upon closer investigation, I found that Big Jones' menu features sandwich options just as appetizing as the regular entrees.  So I resolved to try a tantalizing triumvirate of sandwiches:  the cheese burger, the pork shoulder, and the shrimp po boy. Verdict:  Big Jones does the Earl proud.  Each of these sandwiches is very good (or better) but has one single flaw. The burger is a big, sloppy, decadent, delicious mess.  I eat cheeseburgers so rarely, and this one is worth the splurge.  Bun, beef, cheese, grilled onions, and chow chow all sing in harmony.  The cheese sings too loudly for me; tone it down by about a third and this would be the perfect burger. The po boy is grand but the roll is too thick.  I attacked this thing with a knife and fork, and left a third of the bread on my plate.  Also, when the shrimp cools, the breading becomes a little mushy and the whole package loses some of its zing.  Make sure and eat this up quick. The pork shoulder was my favorite of the three.  In fact, the only ""flaw"" with this sandwich is that there is too much filling for the bun.  It is so rich that I could hardly stand to finish it (though I did).  The pork is delicious enough, but with the mustard sauce and slaw this becomes a transcendent sandwich.  But I would have liked some of that extra po boy bun to temper the overwhelming flavor. As much as I loved the pork shoulder, I have to say that the best thing that I ate during this entire three-meal sandwich survey was the creamed barley side dish.  Absolute heaven.  It was barley, peas, mushrooms, and onions; I don't know what the chef does to this stuff, but the effect is wonderful. Big Jones keeps coming up with new reasons to count it as one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  And I still haven't had the boarding house lunch...",0.9959,0.744,0.198,0.058,0.5275041393791394

The restaurant chef/owner really cares about where the food comes from.  I had a chance to chat with him, and he told me that everywhere the meat and dairy comes from, he has visited personally and knows the farm.  All of his food comes from as local as possible, and everything is from the US, even the seafood.  The man cultures his own sour cream for crying out loud!  Fantastic! But aside from that...the food is just down right delicious. It's rich, southern, home-cooked food that I didn't grow up with (being from southern Indiana originally), but it always makes me smile and feel like I just had a meal from grandma. I love the cocktails this restaurant serves.  They are strong and always made the old-fashioned way.  The amaretto sours are clearly made with real fresh lemons and not that awful sour-mix used by so many bars these days.

I have not been impressed with the service and the staff here needs some serious coaching/training/development.  -I've never had a single drink refilled proactively and neither have my friends/family.  -The server asked my friend how he wanted his potatoes, then when the potatoes o'brien didn't come out with the meal, my friend asked for them and the waiter said, ""Your meal doesn't come with potatoes."" Then my friend said, ""Then why did you ask me how I wanted my potatoes?""

They could never serve those. In New Orlreans. I ordered the Eggs Benedict, the order came quickly, but it was cold.  Flavor was good but needed to be hotter. Mt friend ordered y The Benedict with crab cakes added. Hers was also cold and didn't work with the popovers, which were just OK. waitress was pleasant but not very attentive.

I got the Corn Griddle Cakes which, if you've never had them before, are like sweet corn pancakes and they come with a big serving of scrambled eggs on top, a tomato, almost salsa-like sauce, avocado and sour cream, all served over a bed of black beans. A great combination of sweet and savory if you can't decide what you're in the mood for.  My friend go the Eggs New Orleans, one of their best dishes. It's their take of Eggs Benedict. Best part is probably the popover instead of an English muffin, and that's really all you need to know to order it.  Service here is great. They are very quick, without feeling like you are rushed.

2013-05-21,5.0,"Summary:  John really liked Big Jones. So John, his wife Anne and their friends Gary and Stephanie like to go out to eat on a regular basis.  John and Gary are shall we say... Picky.  Not about the furnishings, the prices, or even the neighborhood.  Nope, just about the food. Big Jones has been on their list of places to try for a few years, the online praise for the fried chicken calling to them like lissome sirens luring in sailors in olden days. We went to Big Jones for dinner last weekend.  No fried chicken on the weekend.  No problemo, I don't look for fried chicken when dining out unless I'm on the road or eating out with the whole family. So let me just say... Wonderful. Heirloom Southern Cooking.  Indeed.  I get it.  Mission accomplished. We started off with some cocktails, and I had the Sazerac.  I vaguely know it's an older cocktail, but that's about it.  I'm not a cocktail guy but I enjoyed it.  I wanted another one which means I liked it. Let's get to the food. Appetizers: Cajun Liver Fritters Tete de Cochon Fried Green Tomatoes The fritters were savory, not uber liver'y and very nicely prepared.  The Tete de Cochon was savory and offset by a nice dark jam.  We adorned our bread with the aforementioned toppings and enjoyed.  I've gone through life never having fried green tomatoes before, and they were tasty, and honestly, kinda cool.  I like to fry everything so I liked how they were fried on the outside but still juicy on the inside. Entree Soft Shell Crabs + Rice, a special and also seasonal Etouffee Shrimp and Grits Yours truly got the Soft Shell Crabs, and oh my!  So good.  The crabs were outstanding, and the rice had I think Asparagus in it, and it was just perfect.  Great savory flavors.  It was a wild rice of some sort and the seasoning was delicous.  I couldn't figure out what it was, it eluded me.  I'm betting a lot of cool things, maybe a little wine, a little soy, hard to say.  I like that I couldn't figure it out. My dinnermates had the Etouffee and one had the Shrimp and Grits.  Very nice.  Perfect.  I sort of finished everyone else's plates. We had a nice Chenin Blanc with dinner (thank you for the suggestion Alison!), I believe it was the 2007 Régis Cruchet sec, Vouvray, France.  Crisp, nice fresh citrus notes, a nice clean wine that didn't compete but that nicely accompanied our entrees. Desert: Bourbon Raisin Bread Pudding The beignet style desert (I don't recall the name) We fought over the beignet style desert, getting loud and frantic.  The bread pudding was still very good, but it was like comparing a Ferrari to something that is 7/8's as good as a Ferrari.  It was still very good, but the beignets sailed off with the gold. Let me say, the reviews I've read on here for some reason made me think that this place was going to be more about comfort food, which can sometimes means big portions but short on flavor. Big Jones from a dinner standpoint was a standout for me.  I couldn't have been more pleased with the flavors, the care and attention that went into the sauces and food preparation, and the even the timing of the food was perfect.

This is a place that without a hint of pretense serves up some of the most delicious and unique brunch food I've ever had. We chose this place by virtue of reading various menus. The menu provides so many delectable descriptions that we didn't know where to start.  We started at the bar with a bloody mary. There was no huge skewer of accompaniments with it, but oh, wow the flavor. They make many items in house here, including unique cured meats, one of them is house-made Worsteshire! The flavor was amazing. They also grated fresh horseradish on top. They bring you complimentary bennies when you sit down - try not to spoil your appetite on those!  We started with two dishes from the entree side of the menu: Bayou Teche Louisiana crawfish, spicy smoked andouille, and cream cheese, with bearnaise sauce and scallions, choose potatoes or creamy grits. And Hominy and Farm Egg Scramble Homemade hominy scrambled with Moore Family Farm eggs, served with black beans, spicy tomato sauce, avocado, and sour cream. The first bite of each was one of those amazing moments when you know the long cab ride from downtown was well worth it. This is comfort food that is prepared with such care and attention to detail that it is simply rapturous. Both dishes were beyond delicous.  We then tried a sampling from their meats, the Tasso. It's like a super cured ham with really intense flavor. Again it had us reaching for superlatives. We had some popovers with that and they were light and flakey.  This is a place that I can not wait to get back to!  I should also mention the friendly service. Our party went from 5 to 2 then to 3 and I know that was a pain for them but they accomodated us nonetheless and with kindness and a smile.

My mother was born and raised in the south, we spent our summers in Charleston as a kid, and hell - I've read every Pat Conroy book ever written. I was pumped to learn there was a southern brunch location in the city.  Long story short - the main meal missed the mark significantly. Here's the run down, I ordered:  - Glass of Tea - there is a choice of 12+ different hot teas and several cold teas. It is nice to have such a wide selection, and all the tea was loose (no bags), served in your own miniature kettle. Good Stuff - Check - Complimentary beignets - Tasty, light, an flakey. Good Stuff - Check - Eggs New Orleans This dish is a Eggs benedict but replace the ham with a crab 'dabble.' I say 'dabble' because the small amount of crab meat could not by any standard be considered a cake. To replace the large amount of crab you are missing, they replace the base with a popovers. Pop overs are like muffins without insides. They have a croissant consistency (buttery, flakey).  Here were the problems :  - The crab dabble had shell in it. It was great crunching into it and having a mouthful of mystery. - The pop over was burnt and the flavor just stayed in your mouth. No amount of hollandaise was saving it.  - The eggs were over cooked (like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for too long) This dish is $17, and my bf ordered the same thing. $54.60 later ... we left disappointed.

The service was pretty good.  There was a couple of times I would have liked more water or coffee, but it only took a sec for someone to come by.

2013-04-21,2.0,"Just skip this place and the wait and go down the block to A Taste of Heaven. I know this first sentence sounds harsh but I'll explain. The wait was ridiculously long and I was excited to try this new place with complementary beignets. The restaurant is very nice and clean although a tight squeeze. The busboy accidently spilled water on me but was very apologetic. The incident didn't upset me at first until I realized it set the tone for the rest of our meal. About 10 minutes after we were seated a couple came in and was seated next to us. This couple quickly received their beignets and we continued to wait while every other patron in the restaurant received them except for us. I finally flagged down the waiter and asked if we would get some and he apologized and brought them to us. Then the people seated next to us received their food first but there was some sort of issue and their food was sent back. Finally we received our food and my order was completely wrong so I sent it back; that's when our neighbor leaned over and told me she thought they had confused tables and brought them our food and us their food. This would seem like an easy and quick mistake to correct but for some reason both our table and their table were left without food for about another 5 minutes. When we finally received our food, although it had ok flavor, was ice cold! The food tasted as if they had taken it back to the kitchen and let it sit purposely. IF it had even been warm they may have received an additional star because the food was ok tasting, but only ok nothing out of this world. I ordered the simple southern breakfast with the boudin sausage patties and they were the best things by far, but in my opinion the temperature of the food was almost insulting!",0.9717,0.82,0.121,0.059,0.505987530987531
2013-04-17,5.0,"Girlfriend and I were decided to get out of the neighborhood and try somewhere new for a Sunday brunch.  She's gluten free (gfGF), and more than one Yelp review pointed me towards Big Jones. We weren't disappointed. I'm going to say I can't be mad for being sat at the bar at around 11am on a Sunday, that was my idiot fault for deciding to eat so late (there was around a 20 minute wait for tables).  The barman was funny, outgoing, and very helpful, albeit a bit of an enabler.  I wasn't planning to drink, but I asked what would be a good brunch cocktail and he came back with a corpse reviver (the gin based version).  I'm never one to say no to an old-timey drink, and lemme tell you, it was one HELL of a good brunch cocktail. gfGF got a bloody which was spicy and topped with fresh horseradish. Complimentary biegnets are light, fluffy, and delectable. She couldn't eat them, but I stepped up to the plate, so no biggie.  The menu seemed to feature a lot of traditional southern cooking using buttermilk, hominy, tasso, etc.  Seeing the words ""reconstruction era"" bought me a great deal of glee, for some reason.  It was just good, honest seeming food, with a lot of love behind the menu. I was eyeing the Gumbo ya-ya, buckwheat banana pancakes, and shrimp and grits, but ended up  with eggs, boudin, grits and cornbread, all fantastic.  The eggs were buttery and smooth, the boudin bursting with flavor, and the cornbread... I've never liked cornbread, but this stuff changed my mind.  Girlfriend went for the hominy and eggs, which came off to me as a good, hearty, farmhands breakfast.  We were both stuffed. The restaurant seems to source as much as they can from local suppliers, including meat, eggs, and dairy. Their shrimp is gulf-shrimp, and their crab is Pontchartrain.  They do all their own charcuterie in house from local pork.  I'll be honest, I don't remember what was explained as gluten free, but they were very accommodating, and there were enough options to keep us satisfied.  The coffee was above standard, the bathrooms were clean, and all of the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.

Located on a familiar stretch of Clark, parking can be pretty inconsistent but I was able to find street parking easily on a Friday.  The host was welcoming and gave me options to seat at a high table near the bar or along the wall toward the back.  There are some tables by the window but it is pretty open in the middle bar area before it narrows down toward the bathrooms in back.  Although the food came from this back area, it didn't feel intruding upon my personal space.  People were sat at tables throughout despite only have 2 servers rather than cornered. Because there were only 2 servers during a Friday lunch, service was spotty and inconsistent.  I ordered the boarding house lunch so that I could try a few things at once.  I didn't order a drink at the beginning but decided to later on yet there was no one around.  The lunch came about 25 minutes later and it was served after 2 tables near me were saved the same thing.  There was no update on the timing or apology for the tardiness of the meal considering that the website states that you could come and go within an hour. The food itself was ordinary.  The fried chicken was tasty and hot but that was pretty much it.  The small biscuit was dry, the gravy on the mashed potatoes had started to congeal, and the voodoo greens were quite watery.  Nearly 5 minutes later, a plate of corn bread came out and when I put the sweet cream butter on, it never melted.  The red beans and rice were good but the banana pudding was only ok.  I really wanted to like the meal and the food, but it was so ordinary that I am not inclined to come back considering the distance to travel.  If you're in the area, it's a decent place to try a couple of things, but I'd be careful with the expectations.",0.9895,0.856,0.122,0.022,0.4559043927648579

As for our entrees, my boyfriend ordered the Egg New Orleans, which is crab cakes with a poached egg, popovers and Bearnaise sauce, which came with potatoes.  I had the bacon, baby Swiss cheese and onion omelet, which was served with creamy grits.  We got complimentary beignets, which were coated with powdered sugar to start our meal.  They were delicious and not artificially sweet like I have had at other places. I would highly recommend ordering the Eggs New Orleans because they were amazing.  I absolutely loved the creaminess of the egg that mixed well with the crab cake.  The popovers were cooked well and give the dish a nice touch.  His potatoes looked really good too, but I didn't get to try a bite of them. As for my dish, it was OK, but just ordinary.  I did enjoy the crunchy pieces of bacon that were in my omelet, but I wished I would have tried something new.  The cheesy grits however, were awesome!

I have been here three times and have tried a number of items on the menu.  All the recipes they use are vintage recipes from the deep south, including the mixed drinks and other beverage options.  Straight up delicious antique ways of cooking the soul-food you've always wanted. In addition to being pretty niche in terms of menu, Big Jones locally sources all of their food and changes the menu based on the season. Most notable from my meals here would be the fried chicken dinner, with mashed potatoes and roux gravy, voodoo greens, red beans and rice, and a giant biscuit. Also, I loved the pork with sweet potato hash, which I tried to recreate, but I couldn't get the same impossible balance between sweet, salty, crispy and creamy sweet potato-soft.   I wasn't able to get my hands on any myself, but I have heard from many people that the sweet potato chocolate pot de creme is to die for.  Layers of sweet potato and chocolate with bourbon, no one is mad about that.  It sells out when they have it. That's just the food!

The Boarding House lunch is only $16 per person (though Big Jones does request it be ordered by every one at the table) which given Big Jones normal prices is an amazing deal.  Everything we were brought was fantastic.  The meal starts with cornbread and biscuits (though for some reason we weren't given biscuits, though tables around us were).  I didn't miss the biscuits since I far prefer cornbread.  And this is good cornbread - moist, slightly sweet, with whole corn kernels.  Then your table is barraged with fried chicken (1/2 chicken per diner), mashed potatoes and gumbo gravy, greens, and red beans and rice.  I wasn't awed by the greens, but I never like greens.  Everything else was amazing - I'm not the biggest gravy fan, but whatever gumbo gravy is I wanted to drink it.  The red beans and rice, which can be tremendously bland, were deliciously spicy.  And the chicken.  Oh, the chicken.  It was perfectly cooked with a flaky, tasty coating.  To finish you get banana pudding for dessert, which is great, because I don't think I could have fit anything but a semi-solid in my ridiculously full stomach.

2013-01-01,5.0,"Let me preface this by saying I have never had brunch here--I live too close to B'way Cellars to take my allegiance elsewhere (and I usually sleep past brunch time anyway).  But the dinners I've eaten here have been fabulous, and more importantly each better than the last.  To the reviewer who complained that Big Jones doesn't ""get dirty down-home greasy simmered-all-day Southern cooking,"" that's not its focus--it has never claimed to be that.  Perhaps because I read its website and reviews (including mission statement) first, I knew going in that it was Carolina low-country Sunday-afternoon-dinner food--the kind of stuff one's proper Southern grandma or great-aunt (who wouldn't be caught dead outside the house without her girdle, stockings and string of pearls) would serve after a long church service regardless of her fiscal circumstance.  After a few meals there, I chanced upon a biography of Craig Claiborne, who grew up in a SC boardinghouse run by a mom who was just such a cook. I've also eaten at one SC B&B that was a converted plantation manor house, and the cooking at Big Jones is remarkably similarly refined-yet-down-home. The difference is that Big Jones' fictional auntie must have been a closet foodie (and probably took more than a few side trips to Atlanta, Charleston, New Orleans and maybe even Paris). There are other places in town to find more downscale authentic Southern fare, but thank heavens this is not one of them. Without a doubt, the star of the menu is the shrimp and grits. And the fried green tomatoes are delicate yet not at all soggy.  Best hurricane I've drunk outside New Orleans (more potent and nuanced and much less sweet--hallelujah--than Pat O' Brien's Drunken-Tourist Trap's). And its Sazerac is the equal of Commander's Palace's. (Great place for Mardi Gras, BTW). Every meat offering (rabbit, venison, farmhouse chicken) has been wonderful. Portions are sensible--neither nouvelle-skimpy nor choke-a-horse gargantuan. The few times I've had to take home leftovers is because I indulged in too many dishes....especially the cornbread. Oh, Lord, that cornbread! To paraphrase Alton Brown's comment on Elizabeth Faulkner's cheese gougeres, it could probably be used as currency in prison.  I wish they'd sell it to go on a regular basis.   Wine list is small yet very thoughtful, and the bar and waitstaff knows it intimately and suggests pairings that are spot-on (especially wonderful dry rosés in warm weather).  Big Jones is not the Maple Tree Inn nor is it a roadhouse with white tablecloths. Neither is it Galatoire's North. But if you are looking for refined low-country Sunday supper food every night, this is the place for you.

We had the boarding house lunch, which adds up to a half fried chicken per person, with mashed potatoes and meaty gravy, collard greens, and red beans, biscuits and cornbread as sides, with banana pudding at the end. It is food porno at it's best when it's all laid out on the table.  Although the execution is great, and the space is also very adorable, I think they miss the mark slightly on dirty, lardy, simmered all day southern cooking. Overall, the items were dressed up, and detracted from the gluttony that is southern food.  My favorites (read: most indulgent) were the hot cornbread muffins with sweet butter, and the thick chunky mashed potatoes with very savory gravy. I am not a huge fan of the cornmeal batter that the chicken was fried in, because it wasn't terribly flavorful, thick, or indulgent. But that's a small ding...it is fried chicken after all. The dark meat was running with juices and very moist, but the white meat was a bit flavorless and stringy. I didn't very much like the collard greens. I ate it because it was the only green on the table, but it had a distinctly medicinal taste, like too much anise or licorice. The banana pudding was also just okay. The service was sweet and laidback, and although we walked in mid-afternoon with few patrons, we didn't feel rushed to finish while they prepare the place for dinner service. The server we had was delightful, but perhaps too laidback, as some of our items, like the biscuits, didn't come out because he took a very long chat with another table.",0.9332,0.849,0.1,0.05,0.4958558558558559

2012-12-05,1.0,"After several years of wonderful experiences at this establishment, it really does pain me to have to write this review. Today, I joined a colleague for lunch and decided to try the pimiento cheese sandwich, which I had heard good things about.  Everything I've had here has been excellent, so I was excited to try this dish. How very disappointed I was!  The menu describes the sandwich as being ""toasted"" but what I received was simply a pile of cold, grated cheese with some peppers and onions on top sandwiched between some toasted bread.  Now, the menu said nothing about the sandwich being served cold, so needless to say the melty deliciousness I anticipated was nowhere to be found. Now, to be fair, apparently eating a pile of cold, grated cheese that looks like vomit is some kind of thing people actually do, but I was not informed about this reality by the waiter or anyone at the restaurant.  When I told the waiter this was not something I expected and I did not want it, he asked if I wanted something else--I refused--and then he just left the plate sitting there while I sat fuming. Because so few people were in the dining room, I could hear the waiter talking to another staff member, whom I'm guessing is a manager, and I anticipated having someone come to the table to explain that this is simply how the dish is made, we're sorry you don't like it and we want to make sure you leave happy. None of this was done.  The waiter was conspicuously trying to avoid me, and seemed terrified to return to the table lest I snap at him, because by this time I was livid.  It is so unreasonable that a diner should be expected to have some kind of knowledge about a regional dish, which this apparently was, and be expected to deal with it if it's not to their liking. My colleague picked up the check as this was a work meeting, and it wasn't until we left the restaurant that she sheepishly admitted that-surprise, surprise-the restaurant had charged us for the dish that I had returned completely untouched!  She just didn't want to make a scene and she was mortified that I had sent the dish back. But, the restaurant really left a bad taste in my mouth when I returned home and posted to Facebook my experience--and when I went back to see if there was a response, I found that not only was my comment deleted, but that I had been blocked from future commenting!  My husband went in and commented with his account and his comment was also deleted shortly after posting it! Now, social media is what I do for a living and this is absolutely anathema!  You don't delete and ban people who have legitimate complaints--you address them and ask them what you can do better next time!   I had a bad experience at Lady Grey this summer and made sure to leave a comment card explaining exactly what went wrong--and they went out of their way to ensure that we had an outstanding experience on our return trip, which they comped completely.   Up to this point, I would never have expected this kind of ""noob move"" from a place as good as Big Jones, but simply because they are unwilling to treat me like a human being I will not only never return, but I'll no longer be scheduling work lunches or celebration brunches there either.

I loved the corn muffins. The pickle sampler thing I would probably skip in the future, although I don't regret trying something once. We shared dishes. I loved the fried clams, which I haven't had in years. They were amazing! The Goat cheese/potato balls I didn't like, I don't know why, could have had to do with the anchovy dressing meeting the pungent goat cheese flavor. To me not a great complement, and I am not an anchovy nor goat cheese lightweight. My friend had the chicken and dumplings. My opinion is that the dumplings seemed tough and hard and the broth was salty. And I love salt!  Should dumplings be hard? I don't know, maybe that's a New Orleans thing. Actually the clams were pretty salty too, but I didn't mind. My friend also had the gumbo, which to me tasted like some super rich dark thin Campbell's type soup that had too much worcester sauce in it. Just didn't really care for it. Is that the way it's supposed to be? I don't know, I always thought gumbo should be full of stuff (or is that jambalaya). The crawfish etoufee was out of my budget at $23. Anyway, it was all amusing but not that great food-wise. I like a lot of similar samplings at Wishbone (including shrimp and grits). I obv. am not an expert on Cajun/Creole, whatever this is called.

2012-10-29,5.0,"I guess they're trying to refine just about every cuisine these days. Upscale sandwich, poutine, and even street food restaurants are all the rage in Chicago. I think Southern food is the easiest to mess up when gussied up - much of its allure comes from the rough-around-the-edges, homemade character, which can easily be lost (see: Q). All would-be Dixie debutantes would be well-served to see how Big Jones does it.  The meal starts with homemade cornbread, rich and buttery, somehow still moist despite the small size,  and with real corn kernels on the inside. Perfect. Reasonably priced charcuterie is a nice addition; Andouille sausage ($5), served with homemade rye bread, is the standout here. Tea-brined and wood-grilled pork loin ($17) is audaciously served medium-rare, and accompanied with a seasonal sweet potato and bacon hash. This was one of the best dishes I've had all year. Mixed greens ($7 for a large) are a welcome accompaniment - piquant in flavor, cooked low and slow with a ham hock, and doused in flavorful pot likker, just the way they ought to be.  Pricing is very reasonable for food of this caliber, and service is personal without being cloying. All in all, it's nice to see a well-executed effort at gussying up a Spartan cuisine for once. Because it is able to pull off this exceedingly rare feat, Big Jones is an absolute homerun.

There are some obvious staples - okra, grits, and collard greens. You will also see the expected gumbo, etouffee, and catfish. Not every item on the menu is a gastronomic sensation - some are not particularly inspired (dumplings are just that) and others are best forgotten. But some were very well executed - the duck, for example, was just the right shade of pink to be succulent (not burnt as is too often the case) and garnished with creative and flavorful sides. Yet others were unexpected in their delightfully tasty simplicity (hint, you'll never think about the hearts of palm the same after eating at Big Jones). The service was pleasantly attentive, knowledgeable, and accommodating. Overall, if you navigate around a few average dishes, this restaurant could offer a fun and tasty way to dine.

It was phenomenal.  Jones starts you off with the Beignets, powder sugared fried dough balls that melt in your mouth.  We also ordered the popovers, but that was before we knew the beignets were part of th deal. Skip the popovers if you're going for brunch, although the house preserves and sweet butter made them pop for sure. They're good, but we didn't need them and the beignets were probably better if I were to choose anyway. Probably should've sprung for something from the Butcher Block as a starter instead. The shrimp with cheese grits was incredible. Really good spice and the shrimp were perfect. The Bayou Teche omelet with crawfish and andouille was plain legit. By which I mean it wasn't plain at all. Be ready for a flavor explosion because this was unforgettable. I can't wait to try more of their menu. Many more options look pretty special too. Topped off our brunch with a Bellini for the lady and a whiskey sour for me, we were seriously satisfied.  Although, I found it funny that they didn't have a whiskey sour recipe at the ready, as this place specializes in whiskeys and bourbons, but the manager dug up his own creation with lemon, orange, orange bitters, and a little cherry liquor.  It was a great cocktail and he even shared the recipe with me.

Usually at brunch, we are promptly given warm and delicious beignets covered in powdered sugar - no dice this last time, and I certainly hope it was a one time omission, as these little treats are such a nice touch to enjoy with coffee while waiting for our meal.

It's served on popovers, which is lovely in concept, but didn't quite work in terms of execution. The popovers were soggy, one of my eggs overcooked, and hashbrown potatoes served on the side were bland and grossly undercooked (I probably should have requested a substitution of cheesy grits!). The upside to the meal were the great brunch cocktails - a sazerac and gin fizz. The service is always attentive without being overbearing.

That was hardly a problem with all the other choices. The lunch menu has an array of charcuterie, lip-service no doubt to the Cajun and 'Nawlins French influences. And here are some other items I have not seen elsewhere in town: a pickle tasting with butter and bread, potato and goat cheese croquettes,  Roasted king trumpet, maitake, and shiitake mushrooms with fresh garlic and thyme, served with creamy grits, sawmill gravy, and piccalilli, a Carolina Shrimp burger with spicy mayo and chow-chow, a side of buttered popcorn rice, and a dessert like warm coriander oat cake. All in all, a nicely limited collection of pates, sandwiches, lunch platters, sides and desserts. I ordered the Carolina Shrimp burger and a side of Voodoo Greens. My lunch buddy went meatless with the Roasted Mushrooms and Grits. A small plate of corn muffins arrived. They were warm and soft little numbers we enjoyed with fresh butter. We cooed with joy over the tender pieces of real corn. They got me with the muffins. My burger was like a wider and flatter crab cake on a bun, and the flavors were perfectly balanced with sweet and hot, and the crunchy chow-chow. My greens were so well flavored and earthy with just enough vinegar that they tasted like meat! The greens were collard and kale. My friend worked on his shrooms and grits very diligentlly but i did not manage a taste. He devoured it all. The $16.00 Boarding House lunch special is always fried chicken I learned. Alas, I'm not a fried chicken fan. But I was amazed when I watched our neighbors get their platter for two. It was a very generous serving.  Southern desserts almost always seduce me, but I resisted the call of the sugar sirens this time. I may have to return for one of their half dozen or so pies, cakes or tarts. I'd love to order Peanut Gooey Butter Cake in my best Bubba accent.  I cannot fail to mention our server who is clearly in love with the place and the food.

The menu itself underwhelmed, there isn't much to chose from in terms of full entrees.  The special was presented later but to be honest I couldn't even hear what the waiter was saying.  After another fairly long wait the waiter returned to take the order.  I settled on the Chicken and Dumplings.  The start of our meal was rather interesting as one friend discovered a worm in his salad.  There is nothing like eating your meal, having to inspect every fork/spoonful to make sure there isn't anything there that isn't supposed to be there.  I also must mention that the broth the Chicken and Dumplings were served in was extremely salty, and the dumplings flavorless and heavy.   Add to this that one of my friends ended up with a splinter of glass in his finger because the martini glass his drink was in was broken.   While the drink and food were removed from our bill, the whole experience was less than one would expect.   I am not at all thrilled to go back due to slow service and questionable food and drink preparation practices.  While I heard that the brunch menu is much better, I am still going to have the idea I have to watch everything that I get here before I eat or drink it.",0.9203,0.845,0.09,0.064,0.45570436507936507

And immediately the manager was there, apologetically to take a drink order. But still no server. Hmphf. We finally placed our order and received beignets while we waited. That were cold...which is a bummer because these babies should melt in your mouth.  Our food quickly arrived thereafter and was ok. I got the Eggs New Orleans w/ grits. Served on popovers...I think I may have preferred english muffins because the popovers were hard to cut and keep everything intact. But still yummy. The manager was nice enough to discount our drinks from the check...but we still felt slightly neglected by the end of our meal based on our experience.",0.9206,0.799,0.114,0.087,0.4993087121212121

The best meal, in my opinion, is the shrimp and grits. They melt in your mouth, and the shrimp is perfectly cooked. The tea menu is extensive, and I love the cornbread too. Service is pleasant, but I've also had slow service during moderately busy times in the past. I was surprised to see a couple recent bad reviews.

2012-08-27,5.0,"This place is just spectacular. I've been several times for dinner (it's a great date spot), but just recently started going for brunch... I've been the past two Sundays in a row, as a matter of fact.  The typical wait for brunch is around 30 - 45 minutes, I'd say... But they take reservations, which is pretty a-typical for a brunch spot in general... Let alone in Andersonville.  The mimosas are wonderful... Definitely made with fresh-squeezed orange juice and, at $6 a piece, they're totally worth it. Yesterday, I tried the Bloody Mary and it was exactly how I like it... Full of flavor with just the right amount of heat (and the raw okra garnish gives it a great Southern flair). I tried the gumbo yesterday for the first time and it was amazing. I've read a couple of reviews stating that it wasn't a typical gumbo, as it's made with a dark roux and that some people (who ordered it regardless) just weren't all that into it. But I definitely was! It might be more of an acquired taste... Like a mole sauce. It's thick, dark, smokey and absolutely amazing. Everyone ordered different entrees (Cajun pancakes that were shared, Eggs New Orleans, Bayou Teche and a fried catfish and plantain entree whose name escapes me) and we passed around bites... Absolutely everything was incredible and I'd order any of those entrees again in a heartbeat.  There was a minor (very minor... Extremely minor) mishap with the food arriving at the same time and our server was so nice and apologetic about the whole thing. Seriously... Nobody at the table was even remotely negatively affected by this slight (very slight) error (if you'd even call it an 'error') and it certainly didn't have a negative impact on our experience at all. Nevertheless, the server and whom I'm assuming is the manager (I believe his name is Dave) went completely above and beyond to make sure that we enjoyed ourselves, loved the food and would make a return visit. I have every intention of making many, many more. We all left with full stomaches, minor buzzes and really, really great moods.  If you haven't been to Big Jones by now, you're really doing yourself a disservice. I absolutely love every single thing about this place. Major kudos to the staff, the management, the chef...

2012-08-26,1.0,"I've read all the hype about Big Jones and couldn't wait to try it...hmmmmm. I LOVE southern cooking and I know good food and Big Jones has neither.  First, I should have been cautious when I walked in to find that the premise of the place is upscale-soul food.  Typically if the food is any good, then the words ""upscale"" and ""soul food"" don't belong in the same sentence. I started with the gumbo ya-ya, the waitress cautioned me that it was a unique gumbo since it was made with a ""dark roux"".  When it came to the table, she was right, it was very dark, but what she failed to inform me of was the dirt-like taste!  Yuck!  I forced down two bites and couldn't finish it.  When the waitress returned to check on me she asked if I wanted it to go, to which I replied a very quick ""No"".  We then discussed how it was not my idea of gumbo and she obliged by taking it off the bill (appreciated that).  For my entree I had the savannah catfish and grits, it looked amazing until I bit into the fish only to find that there was absolutely no seasoning on it - not even salt!  Finally, I thought let me end this meal on a good note with some dessert, so I got the peanut gooey butter cake that is served with coffee crunch.  The cake was o-k, but the accompanying coffee crunch was a house made toffee that wasn't coffee flavored - it had actual coffee grinds in it!  After eating a piece of the toffee I was left with bitter coffee grounds stuck in my teeth for the next 30 minutes - YUCK! This was one of the worst examples of southern cooking I've had.  The only thing they did superbly was the little cornbread muffins they put on the table.  I won't be back.",-0.8966,0.869,0.052,0.079,0.4682708032708033

I got the chicken and dumplings entree.  Another reviewer complained of the amount of cracked pepper put onto the dish as well as the lackluster lima beans come butter beans.  Both complaints were valid, but overall the dish was fine.  I don't think that it was worth $14, but it was enjoyable.

2012-08-13,4.0,"I had a reservation here on a Saturday at noon that I was able to get without a problem, which surprised me as Chicagoans are crazy about brunch. Regardless, we arrived a few minutes early and decided to wait a few extra minutes past our reservation time to get one of the few outdoor tables on their back patio. While we were waiting we took in the beautiful atmosphere indoors which was very classically old southern. The restaurant was mostly full and bustling, but it didn't seem to incredibly loud, which I noted for our next visit when the weather may not be as nice. The back patio was tiny, maybe 6-8 tables that could accommodate parties of four and two. They did a great job with the space though by adding huge plants that break up the area in between the tables all nestled within a huge privacy fence that hides the fact you're pretty much sitting in the alley. We had a very attentive waiter who quickly brought us water and took our drink orders. I was happy to see that the coffee they serve is an Intelligentisa Blend which is always tasty and a great accent to a brunch/breakfast. One of the members in our party ordered their freshly squeezed orange juice which looked amazingly pulpy and delicious. I heard no complaints from her and when she ordered a second I knew it was solid, and as it should being over $3 a glass. After we all had mulled over the extensive brunch offerings, we put in our order and we were served up some complimentary beignets. Being somewhat ""new"" to southern style cooking, I had actually never had one of these. They were essentially less sweet donuts doused in a pile of powdered sugar. The dough itself was a little bland for my liking, but dipping it repeatedly in the powdered sugar helped remedy that issue, making me glad they weren't incredibly sweet on their own. This definitely helped whet my appetite for the destruction of my brunch which happened shortly thereafter. Here's the damage that was done: 1) Eggs New Orleans (Ponchartrain blue crab cakes with poached eggs, popovers, and bearnaise sauce, served with Potatoes O'Brien): Delicious. Absolutely delicious. Dare I even say INCREDIBLY delicious? I mean, I knew I was in for a treat as soon as my eyes glanced over the word crab and poached eggs. The very meaty and minimal to no filling crab cakes were nestled neatly into two soft popovers with a poached egg delicately perched on top. There was just the right amount of bearnaise sauce on top that mixed wonderfully with the egg yolks when they were broken. It was the tastiest mashup of flavors that I've had in awhile, and I inhaled the entree. The side of the Potatoes O'Brien was also a treat as the hashed browns were perfectly browned, giving it a nice crunch, along with the bites of onions and peppers. I'd absolutely have this entree again. 2) Big Jones Benedict (House cured and smoked ham simmered in Kilgus Farmstead cream, served on a traditional farmstead biscuit with poached eggs & Potatoes O'Brien): My boyfriend got this dish and I nabbed a bite, and it was also incredible. It was essentially the same as the Eggs New Orleans but with ham instead of crab. I'm pretty sure his was also served over popovers, but I could be wrong. The ham was some of the best I've had brunch wise in awhile--it literally flaked apart and had an amazing smokey ham flavor. 3) Gumbo Ya-Ya (Gunthorp Farm chicken and house andouille in a deep, dark, smoky roux, with steamed aromatic Arkansas rice): One of my friends ordered this, and I snagged a bite after I gobbled up my food. It was a huge difference from my rich and savory meal, so the flavor contrast was huge. It was VERY smoky tasting, almost to the point of tasting burnt. I wasn't a huge fan, but I feel like had I been eating it the entire time I would've liked it more. He finished almost every bite, so I feel like that speaks enough! 4) House Cured & Smoked Bacon and Early Onion Omelet (House-cured smoked bacon and organic baby swiss cheese with Spring onions and local spinach, choose potatoes or creamy grits): The other member of our party got this one, and she seemed to love it! I was past the point of fullness to try hers, but the omelet was huge and looked awesome, I probably will venture to get it on one of my next trips here. 5) Side of Bacon: Thick cut, slightly crispy, but not burnt. There was a slight hint of maple and it was fantastic. When it comes to thick cut bacon this is second place in my book behind Au Cheval. Trust me, I don't mess around with bacon. I'll definitely come back in the future, but now I'm intrigued to try their dinner and lunch offerings. If you want a different take on brunch from your standard offerings definitely make the trek to Andersonville and hit up Big Jones.",0.9995,0.749,0.206,0.045,0.5313487274770459

Now, my review can only speak for brunch, but, if the mornin' meal they're serving up is this good? Come on, how can dinner be anything less than amazing?? I was really surprised that we easily got an 11:00 reservation, thinking our only options would be 9:00 am or 3:00 pm. First of all, can we please talk about the bloody mary's here?? I only get a craving for a bloody mary every so often, but, after having had it once, I couldn't wait to get back for more. The tomato juice is so unbelievably fresh and the drink is seasoned with perfect amount of saltiness and spice..divine. And I really like that it's not served in a huge pint glass, because it's usually way too filling, and I wind up not wanting to eat anything. Theirs is the perfect size, doesn't fill you up, and compliments the food. The mimosa ain't nothin to sneeze at, either.  As if the complimentary beignets weren't enough, our mouths were drooling over the brunch menu. Luckily we were hungry and figured since breaffast is supposed to be the biggest meal of the day, we would go all out. We split the andouille that's served with homemade bread, garlic aioli, and chow-chow, and it is good-good. The sausage is very fresh, not greasy, very flavorful. For my meal I had the Eggs New Orleans and a side of grits (more on that in a moment), and my hubs had the Bayou Teche omelet. I will say that both dishes were hands down the BEST brunch food we've had in a very long time. That's a bold statement to make, people, and I stand by it: THE BEST BRUNCH FOOD INGESTED IN WHO KNOWS HOW LONG! The Eggs New Orleans is crab cakes w/poached eggs, atop a popover and sauced with bearnaise. I drooled typing that. A modified eggs benedict that is surprisingly light and the crab cake gives it a great flavor. The potatoes that come with it are my favorite kind for breakfast: thin, crisp, seasoned with onion and peppers..perfect. I had a few, okay many bites, of the hubs omelet, and, I loved the savory combination of the craw fish and andouille with the sauce. Again, not super heavy, which was surprising given the ingredients. And now for the grits..they get 2 thumbs up. Creamy, buttery, cheesy, savory. Yum. I love grits and Big Jones didn't disappoint.  The service has been wonderful each time we've been, and I love that they don't make you feel rushed. Excellent food and drinks make this THE spot for brunch.",0.999,0.727,0.239,0.033,0.6002689456137733
2012-08-02,2.0,"I've had some very good food at Big Jones - the Fried Chicken Salad was my all time lunch favorite, and I miss it sorely.  But the last couple of trips have turned me off. Service is fine, no complaints there.  Our server even turned the air conditioning down a notch when we complained about the cold yesterday.  But the noise level seems to be permanently dialed into the place.  The music system is blasting out good music at almost painful levels.  On a previous visit my wife and I walked in, felt the noise, and walked out. Their shrimp burger is a hands-down favorite of my wife.  I've tasted it and it's very good.  I just had to go with the fried green tomatoes, having been raised on them, and decided to try the chicken and dumplings. Folks, we didn't slice the tomatoes half an inch thick and then fry them until the cornmeal was crunchy.  About a quarter inch, dredged in flour and corn meal, and fried just long enough to meld the flavors of the tomato with the breading.  The acidity of all that green tomato completely overpowered the sweetness of the corn meal.  But I'm not going to tell Chef Paul how to cook his food.  Just ain't gonna order that again. On to the chicken and dumplings.  The menu advertised it as having butter beans - another staple in my Kentucky household.  These were undercooked Lima beans.  Shame on these guys for trying to pull a switch like that.  The chicken was very tender but had that grainy texture so much organic chicken has these days.  The dumplings were tough, shapeless (and tasteless) lumps of boiled unleavened dough.  The gravy was really just broth, and extremely salty.  The crowning touch:  the dish arrived covered in cracked black pepper.  I love black pepper but this was WAY over the top. Corn bread, as usual, was great.  Love the stuff.  Just can't make a meal off it. I really want to like this restaurant but have to say the kitchen staff is apparently tone deaf when it comes to putting flavors together in an appetizing package.",0.9828,0.852,0.107,0.041,0.5505687830687831
2012-07-28,4.0,"Big Jones is open for brunch, lunch and dinner daily and serves up authentic Southern cuisine. Today I was joined by some of my CARA running friends for brunch after our 13 miler. For just a couple dollars more than your run-of-the-mill brunch joint you can enjoy an interesting menu with lots of high quality locally sourced and sustainable ingredients; furthermore Big Jones makes much of the food in house such as the bacon, sausage and pickles. Definitely an elevated brunch experience. I also give huge kudos for Big Jones being on Open Table, many of the city's popular brunch spots do not take reservations and can be mobbed, so I greatly appreciated this as I know dealing with reservations for a busy, fairly inexpensive venue can be a bit of a nuisance.  Big Jones' interior is nothing fancy, but seemed clean and comfortable. As it was such a gorgeous day we opted to take advantage of their patio seating which likewise was comfortable, but a tad nondescript. There are only a handful of tables outside, so try to arrive early to maximize your chances. Our server Kat was friendly and attentive; while she was a bit soft spoken I appreciated that she took the time to describe each dish as it was served and she readily accommodated any modifications we requested. She also was very kind to my wife who started feeling a tad ill at the end of our run, doing her best to try and bring her something to help settle her stomach.  Food wise I ordered the fried plantains that were served with a peach puree. This were outstanding and I would definitely order them again. I also had the Gumbo Ya-Ya which was a large portion of rice, a spicy, smokey broth, okra,and generous portions of chicken and andouille sausage. It tasted a bit different than other gumbos I have tried; while I would not say it was great, it was very good. As bread service we were delivered a complimentary serving of Beignets. Having spent my college years at Tulane in New Orleans I have consumed a plethora of Beignets (mainly at Cafe du Monde); these were certainly on par with what I recalled from my Tulane days. Big Jones also has a full bar (including brunch cocktails) and I sipped on a Bloody Mary during my meal (as this is by far the tastiest way to get salt back into your body after a long run). The Bloody Mary was alright, but nothing fancy with only a single pickle as garnish.  Big Jones receives a lot of attention on one of the Chicago foodie forums, so I was happy to finally dine here. Overall the brunch was very good; the menu is interesting enough and the service was good enough that I definitely plan to return at some point.

I'm not a fan of pulp but it was easy enough to scoop some out with a spoon. Overall, our food was good and not overly filling (you know how you tend to overdo it at brunch!). The shrimp and grits were tasty and there was a decent amount of shrimp so I didn't feel cheated. I wasn't drooling over the dish, nor was my friend, but we left happy and I cleaned my plate.

Our waitress was great and very knowledgable with the menu.  We are rookies to the southern style food so we kept it pretty safe. Started with the gumbo ya-ya appetizer. It had great flavor and was spicy without being too much. Also, the cornbread was delicious! So soft and tasty! For our main dishes we got the pork sandwich and pork and beans. Both were excellent.

It goes without saying that we are committed to contributing our time and efforts, specifically referring to our travel time from point A to point B. In this case, Big Jones was one of the restaurants that took us 45 minutes in total train and walk time to arrive there. First, I have to say that I was pretty surprised with the classy layout of the restaurant. Nothing like I expected. The next good impression was the host at the entrance. He was nice enough to accomodate to my requests to be seated by the glass window, despite the fact that it was a busy lunch time and only limited tables available. I liked everything about the place but not so much the food that I ordered, which was the Gumbo Ya-Ya. But just to be clear, there wasn't anything wrong with the food and it was entirely my personal dislikes for the dark, smoky roux in my dish. It had a salty and slightly burned flavor to it and my bf thought the same, so we ended up adding a few tablespoons of water to make it less salty. However, the shrimp and grits from the brunch platter tasted pretty good and worth a try. If you're wondering, my bad meal at Big Jones did not affect my decision to give this place another chance.

Upon arrival, I noticed how clean the restaurant was and the nice southern decor.  It definitely reminded me of some restaurants I ate at last time I was in South Carolina, which was definitely a good thing.  From the moment we walked in, we were treated very nicely by the staff.  Through the whole thing, our waiter was great. He was probably one of the most genuine waiters I've had in a long time actually. Now for the food.  First of all, the beignets were great.  I wasn't super hungry and was trying to save room for the main course, but I found myself eating them uncontrollably.  I ended up ordering the Shrimp & Grits while my girlfriend, who had never had southern food before, ordered the Gumbo Ya-Ya.  Personally, I found my Shrimp & Grits to be great.  They were seasoned just right, with the right amount of cheese for the grits, and a nice touch with scallions on top.  As far as my girlfriend's Gumbo goes, it was good, but I've had better.  Personally, I found it a little too salty for some reason.  Even with the salt it wasn't too bad, but if that was toned down a little bit, it would taste a lot better in my opinion. Overall, the food we had was good, although could be a little better. No big complaints though, and the staff was great.

The atmosphere is nice, if nothing overwhelming. The back patio is indeed a treat, in season. The drinks situation is very good, but the cocktails are needlessly overpriced (although they do make a tasty Sazerac), and the beer selection could be expanded. The real (5)star here is the food. The passion the restaurant has for its ingredients and the possibilities they present--all with a delightful eye on history--has shone forth in every meal I've had there. I had a suckling pig with greens over grits that literally made me cry it was so good. A delightful serving of ham--with greens, cheddar grits and amazing butterbeans--was a close second.

I'm still mournful about Charlie's Ale House and it's underachieving but reliable pub fare. Hamburger Mary's? No. Kopi? Not in a 90s grunge mood today. We decided to head into Big Jones, because we'd passed it several times and it looked interesting.  A glance at the meat-heavy menu posted in the window gave my veggie-wife pause, but she decided that she could probably find something to eat. We asked about patio seating and the hostess graciously went out to check availability and came back with an estimate of 15 minutes. We bellied up to the bar for a cocktail while we waited. I enjoyed a delightfully spicy bloody mary (with the best damn pickle I've had in awhile) while my companion had a popsicle-like daquiri that the bartender whipped up when she said ""I'm feeling something fruity and spritzy.""  Not 10 minutes had gone by when we were ushered back to the patio. The trek to the patio begins pleasantly as you wind your way through the tastefully decorated main dining room and the pleasant back room, and then takes a turn for the slightly less enjoyable as you go past the bathroom and hot kitchen. The patio itself is not the most impressive one I've seen in the city, but is pleasant enough, if small.  Our server was a bit of an airhead, forgetting part of our order along with another diner's order, but he was friendly. After we put our order in he brought out a plate of beignets, which were only so-so. I ordered the Creole ham and eggs, which includes thick slices of ham on top of their homemade (with lard!) biscuits, topped with poached eggs. I'm something of an egg snob, and I appreciate the deep goldenrod color of a quality, farm-fresh, pastured egg yolk. I oohed and awwwed over the yellow hue as the yolk oozed down. The potatoes o'brien (hash browns) were also delightfully crispy. My ladywife had the hominy and egg scramble (without spicy tomato sauce; girl hates her some flavor). She was delighted. We got an order of popovers on the side, because who can resist popovers? They arrived super-hot accompanied by honey butter.  All of their ingredients are sustainably grown, with as much as possible coming from local sources. We checked out the dinner menu online (their menus change seasonally, btw), and didn't find many options for my wife's veggie-loving-ways, so minus half a star for that plus half-a-star for our airhead (but nice!) server.

The glowing reviews make me wonder if my experiences are anomalous, but the fact is that after two visits, I've found Big Jones does exactly one thing well, and that thing ain't ""meals."" So I'll start with the good. Big Jones has some damn fine charcuterie. Maybe not the best in the city, but good enough to get me to eat blood sausage and head cheese and refuse to leave any on the plate. But the food? Yikes. It's run the gamut from dry and bland to inedibly greasy and salty, completely skipping over the delicious happy medium between the two. On top of that, serving sizes are totally inconsistent. It'd be one thing if all the dishes were small, but my husband ordered shrimp and grits so skimpy he was starving within two hours, while my large omelette with grits (the same price, I believe) filled me up until dinner time. We also had issue with service the last time we were here. While our server was friendly enough, it was only after we were about 1/3 through our dishes that he offered the (oh my god so desperately needed, HOW CAN SOMETHING FILLED WITH SEAFOOD AND SAUSAGE BE THIS BLAND?) salt and hot sauce. Several minutes later he swung by with some black pepper. I dunno, guys.

Just for the sake of mention, on the first visit out there between the hostess and our waitress, there was an air of ""stuck uppity"" which we found disconcerting.  Like I said a boisterous bunch, after a few mimosas we didn't care much.  Brunch menu was exciting and though we hit them pretty late that Sunday we still got to score a few beignets!  The chef prepares some badass beignets here.  Note; regardless of the time you visit, if the chef feels like they have the time he / she will send them to your table gratis.  Please don't waste the gesture.   During our brunch we sampled many dishes and our group is a sharing bunch, so we enjoyed the food thoroughly.  For starters I ordered some griddle cakes.  Imagine thin crepes with honey butter and black fruit preserves.  The perfect anytime dish.  Anytime like; imagine you met an Okcupid date here.  You knew going in, it was going to be bad but because (smartly) you chose the venue to be here, you turned an otherwise bad date into a tasty one.  Or at least I did.  Joining their bourbon club was another great idea.  Joining was free and gets you a free pour of their monthly selection any time you stop in for a meal.   So far I've enjoyed my experiences dining and stopping in for bourbon pours.  Entertaining a date or a group of friends it's been good.  I've seen some reviews on Yelp by parents and their reviews are mixed.  In my experience so far, it's an adult friendly place but child friendly, I think there could be an accident waiting to happen.",0.9931,0.788,0.164,0.048,0.5183982683982683

We made reservations for 11:30 through Opentable at about 9 am that morning.  We were seated promptly at 11:30.  Tip to those hoping to ""walk in"" - people who came in while we were waiting (we got there early) were being told the wait was 45 minutes, so reservations are highly recommended. To begin the meal, they bring fresh beignets - they are really good.   If you are looking for a Chicago-style belt-buster portion, this won't be your kind of restaurant.  I'd describe the food as refined Creole.  I had the Bayou Teche omelet - crawfish, anduille sausage and cream cheese wrapped in a rather dainty omelet with a Bearnaise sauce.  My only negative on the dish is that they were rather stingy with the sauce.  The Potatoes O'Brien were served well-done as I'd requested. My wife ordered the Eggs New Orleans - like an Eggs Benedict served on a wonderful flaky popover and a crab-cake instead of an English muffin with ham... They do source locally, and this may sound strange, but the bacon was the biggest surprise.  To put this in context, I believe there are 4 food groups - Steak, Foie Gras, bacon and cream.  Their bacon was literally the best I've had in my 50+ years on this earth.  My wife usually gives me the ""look"" when I order bacon as a side with an everything omelet - she's the one that insisted we order another side to share! My niece and her boyfriend were our guests - they raved about the food too.  He had the gumbo, she had the Eggs New Orleans too. They do have a full coffee bar, but the house brew was really good - no need to go all fancy, just order coffee and spoil yourself with the wonderful cream they serve with it. The service is as others have mentioned - a bit inconsistent.  I was planning to give the restaurant 5-stars, but my wife looked over my shoulder and said ""the waiter was so condescending, you have to take a star off.

I felt like a doorbuster mama Walmart at Christmas. I NEED THOSE BEIGNETS! I WILL BE THE FIRST TO GET THEM! Just kidding, it's because I foolishly registered for the Ravenswood Run 5k way back when I was in Germany with nothing to do on the weekends but run.

2012-04-19,5.0,"I live in the neighborhood and absolutely love big jones!  My husband and I make it a point to go at least once a month as we are part of their ""bourbon society"" (you get a free tasting every month of a particular bourbon..once you try them all, you get a 5 course meal with bourbon pairings....admittedly this will take us about 4 years, but we are patient people ;)  ) My husband loves the gumbo and thankfully it is on both the dinner and brunch menu.  I am originally from the gulf coast and love having a taste of home readily available such as shrimp and grits and collard greens.  The ingredients are fresh, local and they cure and grind their meats in house which I find impressive.  I'm really partial to their hamburger and whatever seafood they are serving that day.  Their shrimp and grits are better than  any I've had in the south. I have a gluten allergy/intolerance and surprisingly, this is one of the most gluten-free friendly restaurants around!   Their complimentary cornbread is gluten free, as are most sides. Additionally, if I'm ever interested in something, they never hesitate to make accommodations for me. Recently they opened a patio and I'm very much looking forward to spending a lot of time there this summer. Also, it doesn't jump out at you on the menu, but their warm oat cake with ginger and coconut ice cream is AMAZING.   Its more like a spice cake, the ice cream is only very subtly flavored with coconut, and the crystallized ginger and rhubarb jam all come together very well.  My husband was not interested when I ordered it (and indeed ""oat cake"" does not scream ""tasty dessert!"")  but he was blown away by it tool.  The best part (besidesthe taste):  its GLUTEN FREE!   if you are someone who likes carrot cakes, snickerdoodles, gingersnaps, biscoff cookies etc...youll love this. I appreciate that its not a huge dessert, and is made to order.   Next time I order it, I will request more ginger...yum! I have only been here for brunch a couple of times but it is already one of our favorites (and Andersonville is pretty much brunch central so that's saying something).  Dare I say that I like it even more than M.Henry?!  Esp now that they too have a patio. For those complaining of the prices, please do your homework and check out the menu online before coming. Its not selling itself to be something it's not:  you are NOT going to come here and get a plateful of food for $5.  The prices reflect the QUALITY ingredients being used (did I mention that they cure and grind all meats in house? everything is made to order, each batch of bread is made as its being ordered etc).   It's an upscale twist on gulf coast food...I'll gladly pay a few bucks more for a hamburger of this quality and taste.   Big Jones is definitely a unique restaurant and one I hope will be around for years to come",0.9991,0.764,0.225,0.011,0.5373611111111113
2012-04-08,1.0,"I visited Big Jones on Easter Sunday after seeing that they offer southern style food and free beignets while you wait. I am a sucker for soutern food and Cajun food in particular, since I lived in Louisiana a couple of years. My friend and I entered and were asked if we had a reservation which we did not, so we sat at the bar. I was excited by all the Cajun food offerings but kind of surprised by the steep prices. $12 dollars for french toast yikes! I ordered a Mimosa which was great since it was made with fresh squeezed oranges. My friend was not too hungry so she ordered grits. I ordered grits, farmstead biscuits, and Acadian Andouille sausage. I was thinking that I had ordered too much and I was contemplating sharing with my friend. To my surprise the food portions were extremely small for the outrageous prices. The grits were very lumpy and had huge chunks of hominy not at all what I am used to. The grits were tasteless and flavorless even after adding butter, salt, and pepper. The andouille sausage was about four or five slices which were paper thin. And the biscuits were like whole wheat ones that fell apart into crumbles when you touched them. My friend, who was from Georgia was very upset with how her grits tasted as well. I was very disappointed and ready to ask for the manager, but my friend insisted we not complain. Also never even got beignets! I looked around at everyone's tables and saw them or the powdered sugar residue left over. The reason my friend did not want to complain is she didn't want the manager offering us vouchers for complimentary food since she never wanted to return. Our bill was $23 which I thought was outrageous for the small amount of food we received. On our way out we detered a family from entering because the food was awful. That was not true southern food. If this place was a true southern style restaurant the portions would be huge, prices reasonable, and the service would have been warm and welcoming. Our server John was adequate, but he was not overly friendly, warm, or engaging. We still left him 20% because I enjoyed the mimosa he made me.

A couple of months ago, I dined at Big Jones for the first time. Knowing that it is a very popular breakfast/brunch spot in the city, we were sure to make reservations. When we arrived, they had absolutely no record of us even calling. Fortunately, the wait that day wasn't too long, so we were seated promptly. Little did we know that being seated doesn't actually mean that you will receive any service. (I would compare it to getting excited when a nurse calls your name in a waiting room only to have to wait another hour for the doctor to actually see you.) Once we were finally served it took forever to get coffee and our beignet appetizer arrived AFTER we finished our meal. It was so loud that we were barely even able to hear our server. The food was good so we decided to return, chalking the experience up to an ""off"" day at the restaurant.  So, we made reservations again - this time through Open Table - for a noon brunch this past Sunday, April Fool's Day. The reservation was originally for 2, but we called a couple of hours before arriving and added an extra diner. We were told over the phone that we might have to wait for about 10 minutes upon arrival. No big deal. We arrived exactly at noon. The hostess said, ""I see you have reservations for 2?"" I had to remind her of the third member of our party. She told us that we would have to wait 25 minutes to be seated. Instead of offering to send us to the bar (increasing revenue for the establishment), she offered to call me on my cell phone in 25 minutes. Since there was nowhere there to wait, we headed over to Hamburger Mary's for a cocktail. In exactly 25 minutes, we walked back over expecting to be seated. We were told that we would have to WAIT ANOTHER 35 MINUTES!!!! They had supposedly attempted to call, but couldn't get through.   At any other restaurant my reservation would have been honored. If not, the host/hostess would have been apologetic, we would have been directed to the bar for a drink and we would have been told that the very next available table would be ours (not ""hours"" lol).  At Big Jones, the host very rudely stated, ""well, since you didn't answer the phone, you're just going to have to wait."" Who says that to customers???? The atmosphere may be cute and the food may be good, but here are way too many great restaurants in the area who provide fantastic customer service. Unless you are visiting the city from out of state or a neighboring burb and just want a trendy dining experience, do not waste your time here.",0.9883,0.892,0.09,0.018,0.5048646723646721

Here is the review I took down: (now back) I admit, I am a sucker for advertising, and although technically speaking this was not an ad, but the Hungry Hound stopped by Big Jones for lunch and sold me on the fried chicken. The Hungry Hound on ABC7 loves every where he goes, nothing is ever negative with Steve Dolinsky. OK, I get that. My mistake, was going there for dinner and hoping for that same fried chicken as seen on TV....IT IS NOT ON THE DINNER MENU. That's me bad, for not looking on line before making my way into Andersonville to enjoy what looked to be pretty good. For a so called Southern place....the prices were downtown Chicago. The least expensive thing on the menu was a 14 dollar hamburger. I walked out. I wanted the chicken, no chicken. No me.  (that was the review from last week) Now...the owner pointed out to me, they have 3 items on their menu for 12 dollars, including a bowl of gumbo.  Sorry, I missed that!~  A friend of mine was at Big Jones and told me he had the 3 piece rabbit dinner. He said the pieces were small (tiny bunny) that he got 4 pieces and it was one of the best meals he ever had. I asked the owner, again about his chicken!~ My question was, ""If you come here for lunch, and you order the fixed price 16 dollar chicken dinner, do you have to have at least 2 people at the table order this?""  I contend, if your fried chicken is as good as ABC7 reported on, without making clear it was only a lunch item, why not adjust your menu, make a four piece or two piece dinner entree?",0.9846,0.801,0.136,0.064,0.5164583333333332

Entrees were also tasty but less impressive. I enjoyed the gumbo because of the spicy kick and chunks of meat and pile of rice--it was just what I needed for the draft that was coming in. The famed shrimp and grits were of course delicious, but as I mentioned in passing earlier today, ""who doesn't like cheese?"" Considering the emphasis on local sourcing, I expected a little more.

When we arrived a couple of minutes before our time, the hostess (who was dressed super chic) told us they were a few minutes behind on their tables, but if we would just step over to the bar, she would let us know how things were progressing. When we went to the bar, there was one open stool and one with a woman's purse on it. I decided to stand rather than ask the woman if she were saving the seat or could I have it instead of her bag, when the hostess, came over, politely asked the woman to free up the seat and helped her move her bag. Wow! I've never seen that before, and I was completely impressed! It wasn't awkward at all, as the hostess was incredibly gracious to her.  We enjoyed our (huge!) mimosas at the bar, and very shortly (with frequent updates from the hostess, even though people were stacking up in the entry way, and she was very busy), we were taken to our table in a small room in the back. The three of us enjoyed a feeling of some privacy. We ordered cappuccinos and coffees, etc., and while we waited for our orders, we snacked on the delicious, and sugary beignets.  My friend and I ordered the Eggs New Orleans, which was Ponchartrain blue crab cakes with poached eggs, popovers and bearnaise sauce served with potatoes O'Brien ($16). Her boyfriend ordered an omelet. We were all completely thrilled and ate every bite of food served. I thought the popovers instead of muffins was an inventive and delicious substitution for a twist on classic eggs Benedict. Also, the eggs were perfectly, perfectly poached. Yum! Our brunching experience here was a perfect trifecta: great atmosphere, super attentive services, delicious food and drinks.",0.9987,0.77,0.23,0.0,0.6551979727589484
2012-02-06,5.0,"Man, I love Big Jones.  I've been there at least 5 times over the past year, and it's always been consistently good.   The highlights:  They typically give each table freshly-made beignets.  Mmmmm.  nothing quite like freshly hot fried dough first thing in the morning.  And I'm not joking.  Yummers.   Also, the cheddar cheese biscuits are amazing.  It's difficult to describe them without using expletives. Dinner: Fried green Tomatoes (when they have them) are excellent. Boucherie Plate an array of charcuterie.  Each are delectable.   The burger is damn fine.   The shrimp and grits are tasty.   I will say the pork loin and the cat fish are a little meh.  But the fried deliciousness that accompanies it (a hushpuppy for the cat fish and a  Cajun pork boudin ball for the pork loin) are crunchy, fatty amazingness.   Also, the specials that I've sampled are some of the best food I've had there (a duck breast one night and amberjack another night).  So, if you're torn about getting the special, get it.   Finally, the staff is courteous, efficient and helpful.

2012-02-02,4.0,"I really had a wonderful time here at Big Jones for brunch.  There were 5 of us and we made reservations for 2pm.  And of course we missed our bus and we're going to be late.  I called to tell them we were going to be late and they assured me we would get a table no problem.  We showed up about 24 minutes late to be exact.  We were asked about our fun walk and was told a table would be ready for us shortly.   We introduced ourselves to the bar and were welcomed with some brunch libations that we won't soon forget.  I got their Big Jones Screwdriver which had to be the best screwdriver I have.  Strong the way I like it, and the addition of the aquavit and fresh squeezed OJ made this screwdriver a monster of a drink.  The others in my party enjoyed their bloody Mary's.  I was told they were the best they ever have had.  Watching the bartender make the bloody Mary was interesting to watch.  The addition of freshly grated horseradish made it that much more special. After a couple of drinks we were seated.  All of us were feeling a bit bubbly and had been looking at the menu for a while so we knew what we wanted.  We started our brunch with the Tete de Cochon which is a nice way of saying headcheese, the Boudin Rouge or blood sausage, and.  I was surprised how good the headcheese was.  I worked in a deli for a long time and always found that stuff to be well....gross.  This stuff was fresh tasting, spicy, and had the right mix of gelatin and pig goodies.  The blood sausage was a little disappointing they cut it up thin and didn't really give us much either.  I was really excited for this and was let down.  We also ordered a basket of the Sally Lunn bread, it is served with preserves and butter.  Who ever Sally Lunn was, she could make a mean bread. Sweet, crusty, and plain delicious. But things were soon brought back up with my meal.  I ordered a special called the Simple New Orleans Special.  Which came with eggs your way, hash browns, and some more Sally Lunn bread. and two, what I fill call shrimp stuffed hush-puppies.  Let me tell you hush-puppies are a personal fave, and if you put a great seafood filling inside, you have a lifelong customer.  They were perfect.  The eggs and hash browns were well done as well but those little balls of joy is all I can think about lately (make your own joke if you want to).  The others in my party enjoyed the Gumbo (which I got a taste of and was spectacular), Big Jones Benedict,  Eggs New Orleans (looked amazing too), and the Bacon and Swiss omelet.  All were scarfed down and talked about for a while. Overall we had a great experience here.  They were very accommodating and made great drinks and even more important the food.  The service was on par but nothing to special.  I will come here again.  I need to try dinner!",0.9974,0.794,0.184,0.022,0.5392941864532773

I thought it was a good choice for my parents since they generally like unfussy food. Sadly, nothing appealed to us on the menu. I had the fried seafood platter, which was pretty good, nothing spectatular and I would've appreciated a heads up on the fact that there were no sides; just fries with it. Do you think I needed more fried stuff with my fried fish? Could I get a side of greens with that? At any rate, it was a total waste of calories. My dad had a pulled pork sandwich that was ok, My mom had the sweet tea brined pork, which was also fair; boyfriend had a burger. There was nothing big or special about anything we had except for the big bill.

Winn Dixie (southern grocery store) muffulettas are better that these things were in terms of filling. We've been served dishes with so much fat they were completely inedible. Generally speaking, the food is overpriced and often disappointing.  We want to love it. We just can't.   And frankly, they've taken the only thing worth dealing with their ""quirks"" for off the menu. That was the Carolina style BBQ.

2012-01-21,2.0,"I've been coming here off and on since it first opened several years ago. I really like some things about this place. The gumbo is the best I've ever had. When it first opened the restaurant brought delicious boiled peanuts to the table (like edamame but better). That didn't last long, alas.   I feel like the restaurant has steadily gotten more pretentious, offering worse service, and (most important) less tasty food. To give an example, a while ago they had a cassoulet (white bean casserole) special. The chef had a blog post about it, outlining the elaborate steps in the recipe, which used local duck and pig skin, house-made worschestire sauce, stock, etc. Seemed like it would be impressive, but what I ordered tasted incredibly bland and was so fatty that it was almost inedible. It was also very expensive.  I had the same complaint about a prix-fixe meal, with pea shoot salad and fried chicken. Both dishes were almost flavorless. I didn't even think southern fried chicken *could* be bland! I love southern food. I don't care if it's fancied up or down-home, and I don't care if cooks experiment or ""break the rules"" of the cuisine. But it should taste good! And the gumbo is the only thing on the menu I've ordered that consistently does. I respect that the chef uses high-quality ingredients, and I still think this restaurant has potential.

2012-01-13,2.0,"Sadly, I'm deducting two stars for a once-beloved venue that featured one of the better incarnations of my not-so-guilty pleasure: fried chicken. I had one of those $10 A La Cards that would expire on 12/31. I hate seeing coupons wasted so I made a reservation for BJ for a Tuesday night in December, which was the night they featured their vaunted fried chicken special. I hadn't been there in a while, so I called the day before to confirm that they were still serving fried chicken on Tuesdays. Turns out that they serve it 5 days a week! The bad news: it's now served at lunch, M-F, as their Boarding House prix-fixe lunch. Well, I work M-F, as does a good deal of the population, so that posed a problem; I canceled my reservation and had to figure out an alternate plan. The week after Xmas is slow in our office so I decided to burn through a vacation day that Friday, all in the name of feasting on fried chicken and using up my soon-to-be-expired coupon. I enlisted my fellow-fried-chicken-fanatic friend, Jennifer I, to embark on the feast with me. We made a reservation and we were all set. She arrived before I did and already had an iced tea and I ordered their lemonade. After about 10 minutes, I had to politely remind our server that I still hadn't gotten it, and after another couple of minutes, he brought it over. All would be forgiven once I dug into my fried chicken... The Boarding House lunch, at $16, is a pretty sweet deal, featuring fried chicken (duh), biscuits and cornbread, mashed potatoes, red beans and rice, voodoo greens, and sweet potato pie for dessert. The only caveat is that it requires total table participation. Momentary panic set in when it occurred to me that perhaps Jennifer would not be in the mood for fried chicken that particular day, leaving me no choice but to order something else and well as tearfully have to end our friendship on the spot. I needn't have worried; she is my comrade in all things fried chicken, so we both gleefully placed our orders. Our server proclaimed it would take 30 minutes, which we were fine with; we weren't in a hurry and good fried chicken takes time. The odd thing was that it seemed like he was trying to talk us out of ordering it. As if! The chicken arrives and looks fantastic. 8 pieces of plump, golden, crispy fried chicken are set down in front of us. We both immediately reach for a breast, help ourselves to the sides (except for the biscuits which hadn't arrived; more on that later) and dig in. After the beautiful crust was eaten, we started in on the rest, only to realize it was undercooked. It wasn't chicken tartare, but I'm pretty sure properly cooked chicken isn't supposed to be pink. As much as we didn't want to, we had to send it back. We called the waiter over and had him take a look at the chicken. He acknowledged that it looked pink and took our plates away. In all fairness, the rest of the pieces were fine so we ate those while we waited for the breasts to be replaced. He came back several minutes later and explained that chef told him that they go by the internal temperature of the chicken and that they were satisfied that it was cooked properly, but as a courtesy, they dropped it back in the fryer for a few more minutes. We still maintain that properly cooked chicken should not be pinkish-grey, but we appreciated that they ""humored"" us by cooking it a bit longer. When  our plates were brought back, the sides that we previously heaped on them were gone, but no offer to bring more was made. Bummer, but I wanted to concentrate on my chicken anyway. We weren't even sure we were brought out our respective pieces (how did they know whose piece was whose?) but again, we let it slide. Luckily, Jen and I often swap spit (no, not really) so we're okay with each other's germs. Again, the chicken was STILL undercooked. We didn't want to deal with it again, so we just ate the parts that were okay, but really, wtf? It's also about this time that we realize we hadn't yet gotten our biscuits, so we ask about them. Server promises they're coming. Another 20 minutes go by and he assures us that they're ""still baking."" By now we've long since finished our food. After that every time our server passes our table he won't make eye contact with us, because, as you guessed it, there's still no biscuits. Oh, but we're not giving up. We want our biscuits! By now it's almost comical, but we still decide they're worth waiting for. Server drops off our dessert, which oddly, has now turned into bread pudding instead of sweet potato pie. The bread pudding is sprinkled with nuts (which I can't eat), so I push my bread pudding to the side, still eagerly anticipating those biscuits. Biscuits finally come with the check. We asked to get them wrapped and settle up. They didn't end up taking the A La Card as it's not valid with prix-fixe, but comp our drinks. Fine, but after 2.5 hours and the other issues, it was too little, too late.",0.9965,0.845,0.112,0.043,0.5677154195011338

2012-01-01,2.0,"So....this is a follow up review to my first.  I had a bad experience on my first visit and was given a gift card by the owner to try Big Jones again.  This was a very thoughtful offer, so my husband and I went last week for dinner to give this spot a second try.   I will start by saying that the food is thoroughly amazing and creative!  The chef is clearly very talented.  We loved the complimentary corn bread.  Our appetizer was one of the highlights of the meal.  The oyster pecan roast was totally stunning and unique.  The oysters alone were huge, and the smokey flavor was fabulous.  I cannot recommend these enough.  Our entrees were equally as good:  fried seafood plate and pork loin.  The pork actually stole the show with red bean puree and sweet potato hash.  Very creative and interesting. We have no issues with the food and may go back sometime to try the fried chicken lunch.  However..........the issue is with the service.  My husband says that this experience was way worse than our first because it was so bizarre.  I am not sure how we have gotten such odd service two visits in a row, since this is rarely a problem for us (as demonstrated by my other reviews). I will say that our server was attentive and friendly.  However.... 1.  I was told for 45 minutes that my jasmine tea was brewing.  Very odd!  I brew my own loose leaf tea at home, so this is obviously not the truth.  We asked about it 5 times!!!! 2.  The server got the orders wrong or forgot the orders of all five tables he was managing (we could hear everything from our location).  He asked my husband several times about his drink order when my husband told him upon sitting down that he was not going to order a drink.   3.  Our table and the table behind us were served water with diffuse floating debris in it.  Thankfully, the people behind us spoke up.  I was just going to avoid drinking during the meal, but it was replaced.   4.  Our server told us for 20 minutes and 4 different times that corn bread was coming out. 5.  Our server spilled water all over my edge of the table each time he was refilling my now clean glass of water and never cleaned it up.  I had a dripping elbow by the end of the meal. 6.  Our server had spilled water over our free meal certificate and placed it in his pocket.  At the end of the meal, he did not take off the free meals from the bill and completely forgot about the certificate that was in his pocket when I reminded him about it.  I actually had to tell him to look in his pocket for the voucher. There were other issues that I am not even going to comment about with regard to the service, as I do not think they serve a purpose here.  However, the meal took 2 hours, and we did not even have cocktails or dessert.  That is a long time.  Much of the time was taken up by mistakes and excuses.  Very, very, very odd!  Our server did not seem to be ""with it."" As I mentioned, the food is totally amazing here!  I am just not sure what is going on with the service.  It just stuns me!",0.9796,0.851,0.096,0.053,0.5637362637362636

However, I do like southern cooking; I've been to New Orleans one too many times; and Gone With The Wind is one rockin' movie. That said, if Ashley Wilkes ""likes to see a girl with a healthy appetite"", he would have LOVED me and Melanie S.....Watching us strap on our feed bags has got to be more hot than marrying your cousin. Silly rich plantation boy....  We were both quite early for our reservation and luckily, we were still seated immediately. Our host was also our waiter....or, maybe our waiter was also our host. Who knows. Anyway, we both went to Big Jones with no thoughts of anything but fried chicken, which is only available at lunchtime...in my opinion, it's too much food for lunch (and that says a lot, coming from me) but we're fans of leftovers, so yay. Unfortunately, the food, although plentiful, is where things took a downturn....our big honkin' platter of chicken arrived, and....the breasts were raw in the middle. Not pink...RAW. We sent them back to be cooked. The rest of the pieces were cooked through, but let's face it - the breast is the best piece, and cutting into raw chicken is not appetizing.  The sides - collard greens, mashed potatoes, and beans/rice - were good, esp. the mashed potatoes. The fried chicken lunch also comes with cornbread muffins, biscuits, and dessert. It was a good while before the muffins came out, but they were tasty. Apparently, there was some problem with the biscuits....we didn't ask what the issue was...but it must have been a major disaster because our biscuits finally made it to our table....after dessert (which I thought was supposed to be sweet potato pie...we got bread pudding). Our host/waiter apologized, and took our beverages off our tab....but this was quite the clusterfuck.  However...I really, really got the vibe that it was a bad day. There can't possibly be this much confusion in this place all the time. Since it was my first visit, we did get an apology, AND the food was good (once it made it to the table, and it was cooked), I'm generously giving 3 stars, and I'll give Big Jones another shot sometime.

2011-12-27,3.0,"I'm not sure where to begin. I went with a couple of friends tonight and we were super hungry, I knew I was. I was brought here by a friend since he gave me a $10 off certificate. I imagined it to be a very southern style, go big, go home concept. I imagined big plates with lots of food.  We had no idea what to order on the menu, everything looked good, but expensive nonetheless. So we decided to go with the family meal. $25 for 5 courses is a big steal since most of their dinner entrees were $20+. We also started off with the crab cakes. They were definitely amazing, especially the Louis dressing served with it. Although I was surprised to see only 2 tiny crab cakes since they were so pricey. I should've known better.  Anyways, we started off with the Lakeside Fish Gumbo. Okay, this was TO DIE for! It was just what we needed on a cold night in Chicago. The seasoning and the fish and the bacon was just perfect. It was served with this yummy moist aromatic rice that was good by itself too! They were very generous with the amount of fish and bacon that was in the gumbo as well. The next course was the Skillet Cracklin' Cornbread. It was a mighty fine portion of cornbread with bacon and scallions on the bottom, heck the cracklin' part. I was a bit overwhelmed by corn bread because they served it before the gumbo course. Our third course was the Deviled Crab and Red Rice. The deviled crab was underwhelming, the smell and taste of white wine was too heavily present and the crostini that was served with it was sprinkled with way too much salt so they gave us some benne wafers instead which made the dish better. As for the red rice, this was a big hit in my book. It's just hands down so good. The sides of the caste iron cookware it came in was so yummy since the ride on the sides were a little crusty and burnt. The texture and taste of the sausage and the tomatoes were delicious! Our fourth course was the meatloaf with collard greens. The meatloaf was so yummy. The sides seemed to be breaded and I just kept grabbing for more even though I was so full. Although the collard greens were way too salty because of the smoked jowl.  Lastly our dessert was baked apples. They served two apples on the plate and they did not look appetizing. They were brown and wrinkly with cream surrounding them. Unfortunately we just picked apart the apple and had a couple of bites.  Overall the meal was okay. The family meal is definitely the way to go if you want to get a good deal out of it. Just make sure you're hungry. But what I noticed during the whole entire meal is that my friends and I kept grabbing for our water glasses. Everything just seemed over salted.  They definitely seemed understaffed when I went, but everyone was super nice and seemed to go out of their way to help better your meal. I'm not sure if I'd go back again, I think I'd want to try their brunch. Anyways, I'm full for the rest of my life now!",0.9979,0.776,0.178,0.046,0.486919191919192

2011-12-17,5.0,"It's already been established that brunch is my favorite meal of the day so I love finding new places that have a unique take on it. So you have Southern food on one hand and brunch on the other, and you put your hands together, and what you get my friend is Big Jones.  To start, I have to mention that this place is adorable, beautifully decorated, a feast for your eyes as you wait for your breakfast. I love that they take reservations on Open Table so you don't have to wait. Great location on this ""restaurant strip"" on Clark in Andersonville. Easy street parking. Andersonville is the new Bucktown, fewer hipsters, easier parking, less wait, great food. I ordered the ""Simple Southern Breakfast"" which came with two farm eggs (I got 'em scrambled), with something that tasted like a crab cake, plus creamy cheese grits, and cornbread--all for $9, great deal. I'm usually not a fan of grits, but I had to give them another try since the server said their grits are awesome. I still think potatoes are better than grits, but these grits were better than what I've had before. Eggs were terrific, crab cake thingy was delicious, cornbread was awesome, oh how I love cornbread. Yum. My friend ordered the ""Big Jones Benedict"" which came with smoked ham simmered in Kilgus Farmstead cream, served on a traditional farmstead biscuit with poached eggs and potatoes. I had a taste of it and it was delicious, the biscuit was phenomenal. The Bloody Mary--get it! It's good, garnished with a pickle and okra, it's got kick and there's nothing better than a good Bloody Mary to help you get over your hangover from the night before. Great coffee served in big mugs and refilled promptly. Great, friendly service. Big Jones is my new brunch bff.",0.9987,0.681,0.294,0.024,0.5939471243042673
2011-12-16,3.0,"Hmmm...I'm torn on Big Jones. Brunch was pretty fantastic and I've been jonsen (haha, get it...uh, sp?) for more but after dinner a couple months ago I was a bit let down.  Brunch was so good I thought dinner would be a can't miss. I love southern cooking so much and when you can't even get some hush puppies right and a pork shoulder sandwich, we got issues.   First off, let's discuss brunch. Cornbread muffins? Yessir!  Get all up in der!  So good with the honey butter and pepper jelly.  My wife ordered a special omlet that has peaches and some kind of delicious cheese. I really can't recall since it's not on the regular brunch menu but the eggs were cooked to fluffy perfection.  I went with the delectable corn griddle cakes which were, you guessed it, corn griddle cakes filled with cheddar cheese, on top of black beans, with two fried eggs (!!), spicy green tomato sauce, sour cream and avocado. Hot damn this was fire! Not spicy, as in so damn good.  We also had a couple bloody mary's which were pretty damn good. oh, and I almost forgot for brunch they give you complimentary beignets. Hot, moist, powdered-sugary beignets. These were the best ones I've had outside of Cafe Du Monde in NOLA.  So, after all that you would be amped for dinner too, right?  Well, we came on Wednesday night and the joint was dead.  Not a good sign for dinner. Bruch was fairly busy. Menu looked really good and after much thought we skipped the family meal that sounded good but didn't look so great on our neighbor's plates. We went with the Pecan Wood Fired Oyster roast as a starter, which was absolutely fantastic. These wood fired oysters were fresh Virginia oysters cooked over a wood fire with Creole mignonette, garlic butter and some kind of ridiculous cheese. I could have had 10 of these and be set for the night (6 in the order). After this we were really excited for dinner.   For dinner, my wife ordered the smoked and smothered pork shoulder sandwich and I got the Gumbo Ya Ya.  The pork shoulder itself was extremely dry and the sandwich overall was rather flavorless despite having vinegar slaw and tart mustard.  The fries were ok but nothing special. My gumbo looked great, in a real dark and thick roux but was so overseasoned it was hard to keep eating.  The gumbo was just really tangy and did not compare to any gumbo I had in NOLA.  This was definitely a disappointment. We also ordered some hush puppies because I love these things but they were a disappointment as well. The puppies were big, but dry and rather flavorless.  It was a lot of corn meal and not much else going on here.  We also ordered a glass of wine (decent selection) and I had a golden fizz gin cocktail (kudos for using my favorite gin, Brokers, with egg yolk, soda, Angostura bitters ) which was pretty nice and refreshing. Overall, the service was pleasent for both brunch and dinner and I'm digging the old NOLA decor. However, our food came out so slow and the corn bread and water took forever to come out even though there were only four tables occupied. Our server was nice but kept making excuses. She also was a bit overbearing with us while trying to decide what to order and literally would not leave us alone until we decided what we wanted. All in all I'll def be back for brunch. I'll skip dinner from now on as the price is not worth the flavor, despite how good the oyster roast is.",0.9976,0.716,0.189,0.095,0.5337346357346359

2011-11-24,4.0,"Brunch is a hot commodity in Chicago, it seems, so the fella and I called ahead to inquire about the wait at Big Jones last weekend. The hostess popped us on the list via phone, which was unexpected but super nice of her, and we were seated within a few minutes of our arrival into this cute bistro. Good thing, because there isn't much room to wait inside. It's close quarters and loud in the front area, so we were glad to be stuck in the small back area. Our server endeared himself to me when he was greeting us and accidentally threw a ramekin full of sugar cubes at me (I caught it, like a champ). Normally, throwing food at a customer wouldn't score points, but this guy was so charming and on top of everything else that it didn't really matter.  The beignets were a-mazing as only hot, fried, powdered-sugar-dusted dough balls can be. My boyfriend ordered biscuits too, and they came with honey butter and raspberry jam that were both excellent. I wish they had biscuits and gravy on the menu here. I really do. We ended up splitting the Eggs New Orleans and the Corn Cakes. The Corn Cakes are savory and come with black beans, salsa verde, avocado, sour cream, green onions and your choice of eggs (I went with poached). They were good, but there was room for improvement, albeit slight. Chorizo would be awesome and a maybe slight crispness to the pancakes for texture. I liked the Eggs New Orleans a little better. This is their version of an eggs bennie, made with popovers, blue crab cakes, poached eggs and béarnaise. The popover and the crab cakes were both tasty (not stingy on the crab) and the poached eggs on both dishes were absolutely perfect. Add a little hot sauce and you're in business. Also of note:  -They use Intelligentsia coffee here. I just had a delicious regular cup of coffee and it was refilled liberally. -Savory waffle with duck confit. Why didn't I order this?

Hasn't Big Jones always served fried chicken? Why, yes, but only once during the week. Lucky for us, the new menu gives us the opportunity to eat family style and knocks it right out of the park.  At lunchtime, the Boarding House Lunch offers fried chicken, biscuits, sides, and dessert, all enough to induce an afternoon food coma and reduce any hope of productivity. Don't order an appetizer. While you can dine alone, this style of dining is best done with at least one other person and plenty of time (enjoy your food and company!). The chicken is tender, juicy, and the outside perfectly crunchy. The biscuits are light and flaky with tasty preserves for spreading. Mashed potatoes, gravy, voodoo greens, and beans and rice round out the meal and fill every every remaining crevice in your belly. I've heard the sweet tea is pretty darn good. If you don't have anywhere responsible to go for the afternoon, try a Sazerac or two. Similarly, a seasonal Family Meal is served up for dinnertime. I'll definitely be back to give that a whirl.  I've been here a number of times and each time has gotten better and better. I won't even go into their homemade andouille, because that would be another two paragraphs of drool-worthy words.

The decor of the restaurant reminds me of New Orleans, somehow.  It is a clean, well lit space, and the chairs evoke the wrought iron look of New Orleans for me.  It is bright and airy and anchored by a bar that seats, as I recall, around 10. A back patio was added this summer, which is great but a bit of a mixed blessing.  It is very small (maybe 10 tables) and poorly lit - we could barely see our entrees.  There is also a hint of eau de garbage from the dumpsters next door, which it unpleasant yet not out of place for a restaurant evoking Bourbon Street.  Fortunately once we moved away from the fence we did not notice it as much. They really nail New Orleans on brunch.  Simply for the privilege of showing up, you receive free beignets, which are doused with powdered sugar and as authentic as those at Cafe du Monde and elsewhere in the Crescent City.  The rest of the menu is heavy on ham and grits, as it should be, and I've always been very pleased whenever I have brunch here.  The fact that it accepts reservations for brunch is another key element to Big Jones' attraction. Dinner menus vary with the season, but I've always been pleased.  There is currently a juicy seared duck on the menu which I highly recommend.  The crab cakes are also excellent, full of crab with very little filler.   I've had their steaks here before, as well, and have always been pleased.  I can't say that the menu is entirely authentic low country food, but it is quite good. The wine list is small but has some good values, including excellent Rhones and Riojas.  The real focus here is on the cocktails, specifically bourbon and rye.  The sazerac here is killer, made with just the right amount of absinthe.  It is a must have whenever you are here, even (or especially?) at brunch.   Big Jones has been steadily increasing their bourbon and rye selection over the years, and now have a Bourbon Society where you can have a free taste of the bourbon of the month every time you visit, and after you've tried all of their bourbons (which are legion), you are entitled to a complementary dinner for two. What's that?  Why yes, I am a member.",0.9974,0.775,0.188,0.037,0.5382941880814222

I ordered the cheddar corn cakes, which I've had before and always like. I was not disappointed this time either. In the past, I've ordered the two-egg breakfast and the migas, which are also great. I'm sure I've ordered other things as well. They do change their menu a few times a year.  One additional thing to note about Big Jones is that they do Thanksgiving dinner every year. I've come here with my parents for the past two years and we've really enjoyed it both times. The menu changes a bit each year, but it's a basic Southern Thanksgiving. The first year we came, we had turducken and last year we had deep-fried turkey. One recommendation: make a Thanksgiving reservation for earlier in the day. We came around 5 pm last year and they were clearly already running out of food since some of the side dishes were different from what was on the menu.

As soon as we sat down i noticed the entire, albeit small, patio completely fill up. I've been a server before and I was starting to get a little nervous for my dining experience.  Thankfully, i had nothing to worry about.  The food was absolutely amazing! I had the shrimp and grits, which was to die for and our server made sure the beignets (free!) were fresh.  We all realized that our server was extremely busy, however, he never stopped taking care of us. It's been a really long time since I've had someone that was genuinely sincere and apologetic for the service taking a little longer than usual. It was refreshing that he actually had concern about us and went above and beyond his standard duties to ensure that we felt completely at home and well taken care of.  This place has definitely lived up to it's reputation of ""Southern Hospitality"".

Well, he'd gotten there before me, saw the prices and tried to back out with many texts. (Let me note, the prices are not unreasonable, just too high for broke twenty-somethings.) However, I, like a dumb ass, walked right in, got seated and got a water so he was forced to join me. We didn't want to be rude and you know, leave, so we glumly stared at the menu which was way out of our price range and also filled with stuff I didn't understand. It's a Cajun and southern-style menu, which is not food I'm familiar with so I was faced with a ton of unfamiliar terms and ingredients. Our server was nice, but visibly disappointed by us, as we ordered the cheapest appetizers we could. I'm a server, I've been there, ""Great. Water and appetizers. I'm gonna make bank on this pair."" She hid it pretty well, but we still felt hella awkward. So, this is shaping up to be a disaster, right? Well, I got the sweet potato hash, and guys it was like heaven shone down upon me when I put it in my mouth. It was sweet, and salty, and perfectly cooked, and glorious in every single way. The tea I ordered was not only from fresh leaves and really delicious, they also brought me fresh honey right to the table. I am a horrible tea snob, and I was so impressed!

We made reservations and got our table quickly with a choice of inside or outside.  We were given our menus. And placed our orders.  I ordered Peach Cobbler pancakes from our waiter.  Our food was brought to us promptly but i was given pancakes with blueberries.  Not the peach ones I had ordered.  When I told the runner this was not what I ordered I was told ""we don't have those anymore"" and given a whiny ""well I guess I can take it back if you really don't want those"" I said no I don't want them.  I ordered the eggs benedict instead.  The waiter came out didn't apologize or explain why he did not know they were out of the peach pancakes.  Our table had no salt at it and we asked for ketchup for the hash browns.  The waiter walked to the next table which was empty and we asked for pepper as well and we got back and very snappy loud ""OK"" from him. The waiter returned with the salt and hot sauce not ketchup and we asked to see the manager.  The waiter told us the manager had comp'd my meal.  I asked to see him anyway based on the attitude we were getting from him and the runner. The Manager came out (who I have since found out is the excutive chef and co-owner) and starts in with I comp'd your meal.  I explained the attitude I was getting from his staff and asked why the waiter nor the kitchen would not have known that the peach pancakes were no longer on the menu as of 2 weeks ago.  He said the waiter wouldn't have known that it was the hostess' fault for giving us old menus.  Has the waiter been there for less than 2 weeks?  This menu is not Cheesecake Factory in length of menu. This is the worse service and ""we're the phone company we don't care we don't have to"" performance I have experienced.  For the first time in 20yrs I didn't leave a tip due to the poor service.  I also wrote on my check that I have been here numerous times and have never been treated like this.

My husband and I both had the shrimp and grits. I can't begin to say how great it was! Superbly creamy and savory grits, perfectly cooked shrimp, more tasso ham and sliced mushrooms. Perfection! We also sampled some of their summer cocktails- i can't remember the name of mine- Charleston something or other made with Sweet Tea Vodka and Lime juice and Ginger Beer I think- fantastic! Bright and refreshing. Our server was really sweet and attentive. Some other reviews said it isn't a place for kids, but i disagree. MJ was one of 2 kids there just last night and the staff was very accommodating. They have a kids menu so clearly that's just not the case. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and experience!

2011-07-27,4.0,"This was my second time at Big Jones, and I loved it just as much this time. I ordered the crawfish, andouille and cream cheese omelet, which was really good.  The accompanying grits were ok, but lacked flavor.  The goat cheese biscuits were good, but I couldn't understand where the goat cheese came into play.  Maybe it was in the buttery spread, which tasted homemade and delicious. I tried the eggs benedict with back bacon, and also had a taste of the fried green tomatoes, all of which was really good.  The duck confit waffles were also really good, they were a mixture of sweet and savory (though I would have preferred more savory, less sweet).  Overall, the food was delicious. My party arrived before I did and I'm told there was some confusion with the hostess regarding whether the table was ready or not, which resulted in awkward waiting in a narrow entranceway.  The service once we sat down was really slow.  They actually brought us an extra plate of beignets because our order was taking so long.  I can forgive all this, however, because I just loved the food so much.  Mmmm.",0.9938,0.749,0.23,0.021,0.44126984126984137

I heard this was a brunch place, but I had to opportunity to try their dinner menu.  For starters.. Duck liver pate serviced with cinnamon raisin bread was pretty good. They don't give enough bread to finish the pate, but will gladly give you more. Next a quite awesome messy crab cake. Huge chunks of crab meat falling apart at the touch of utensil.. things are getting good Ironically, I fell in love with this place because of their cornbread(which they give you complementary). Just like my grandma used to make it. Sweet, with real corn, easy to crumble, served with a sweet whipped butter. This is the real deal.  My entree was gumbo.

We ordered from the regular menu instead and the food was good. We had Shrimp and Grits and Eggs New Orleans. My shrimp and grits were good but I was still hungry after - their portions were small for $13. The shrimps were a tad small, which was fine if they had given me more, but they didn't - I think there were only 6. Eggs New Orleans was delicious, but I thought the crab cakes were a bit dry.

I was surprised to see such an extensive menu of teas. My table ordered and split the following items: - Sally Lunn French Toast: raspberry jelly, coconut pudding, crystallized coffee - Leek and Mushroom: fresh goat cheese, melted leeks, market mushrooms - Migas: farm egg and corn tortilla scramble, tomato, chilies, black beans, spicy red sauce, avocado, sour cream I love that they bring you delicious complimentary pastry puffs while you wait for your meal! The problem I had with Big Jones was the poor service. We spent over 1 and half hours dining here. The place was half full and not incredibly busy, yet it took our server well over 15 minutes to even get our order. And waiting for the check was painfully longer - I had to run back to my car and insert more money into the meter even though I already paid for 90 minutes. Every time I asked the server for something she was rude and never came by to check up on me. The worst was when I forgot my coupon after the check came by, she refused to void the check (yeah, I know it might be a pain in the ass, but I've worked other jobs before and had to deal with situations like these - it sucks, but you just deal with it). When my companion requested a manager, our server claimed that she needed the manger to void the check and recharge me the lesser amount. But then she ended up doing it anyways! It took her under one minute! I know it's my own fault, but I'm still a customer and was being very nice and funny about the whole situation, yet she could be anything but the exact opposite.

Disclaimer: ** This is for a Dinner review... I will come back for brunch at another time. Let's start with the good: They have a lot of very tempting options on the menu. Cheddar biscuits really taste homemade and are ON Point! Their grits are perfect.... a hard thing to master. They have a wicked amount of speciality teas. They do have a small outdoor patio in the back. The not so good: Outdoor seating is small, awkward and you can hear everyone elses conversation even if you are not listening. The cornbread that comes out before every meal is made with canned corn. The crawfish boudin was fried to a burnt texture. The shrimp and grits lets just leave it with the grits saved this from being a disaster. The Pork shoulder, oh you nasty little devil.... you should not be served like a chopped bbq platter!!  Maybe the server was just having an off day but if you are going to say ""isn't it yummy"" EVERYtime you deliver something to EVERYbody's table then at least say it like you mean it!

The andouille sausage was very hearty and slightly spicy. The eggs were cooked perfectly too but the hominy was not my thing. I guess I've never really had hominy before but it was very bland and just kind of meh. I would have rather had some cheesy grits.

The iced tea had a fly in it, which I would have pointed out immediatly but the waiter disappeared until our food came out. Pointing out the fly in the iced tea resulted in an offer to repour the iced tea from the same cooler that the fly was swimming in! I declined and asked for another drink instead. When the gumbo came out it was liquid charcol. I've had a lot of gumbo and been to New Orleans a few times. I've never had runny gumbo and never gumbo that tasted like someone threw it over the coals of a bonfire and scooped it onto my plate. Two bites in, I was ready to leave. Unfortunatly I didn't see the waiter again for 20 minutes. By the time I got the bill, physically chased the waiter down again to pay the bill, I didn't have the energy to point out that they charged me for the fly water tea I didn't drink.

Of the food we got, the beignets and the pork terrines were both quite tasty, but both of our popovers were overcooked and some of my potatoes were actually burned. The eggs and meat were fine, which--isn't cooking eggs correctly harder than not burning potatoes? I considered sending it back, but our server was so MIA and the food so slow to begin with that it wasn't worth the bother. So I'm on the fence and I'm not really sure which is real Big Jones.

2011-03-21,4.0,"In high school my nickname was actually ""big jones.""  Not because of any part of my anatomy or anything.  Because of my insatiable food cravings.  People used to wonder if I was jonesing (during class hours?) big time. Okay, that's not entirely true.  But it could have been.  I do have a tremendous, um, appetite.  What is 100% the truth is that I have not been to New Orleans in 12 years and Big Jones made me want to hop a plane there right away for some laissez les bons temps rouler.  You know, whichever two words in the slogan translate into ""good times.""  I took Spanish in high school, not French. The only thing this helped with was pronouncing the brunch dish I ordered - the migas.  They stick out on the menu filled with Creole specialties but, being a sucker for chilaquiles, I was glad their cousin ended up here.  These were made to perfection.  The egg layer was soft and fluffy and the salsa layer tangy bordering on spicy.  There was hot sauce on the table for the truly adventurous, but I was glad that the sour cream layer was plentiful. And they definitely satisfied the big jones I had for brunch.  The portions here are eye popping.  One of the people I was dining with got the french toast and it looked like it was about to crack the plate with its weight.  Even if my migas hadn't migatagated my hunger, the free beignets bites that come with every table at brunch were warm, soft, and satisfying.  And covered in so much powdered sugar that it left a stain.  They were fun to stick in your mouth that the ladies I was dining with couldn't... But I'm not going to go there.  This is a family review. As far as the waitstaff goes, let's just say that the service was friendly and attentive but not bawdy in any way.  This isn't really New Orleans, just a classy southern-style restaurant.  To satisfy a true debaucherous spirit, apart from this wonderfully tasty food, one would take a trip to the Big Easy.  Which was, for the record, not a nickname of mine in high school either.  Although it would have been fun if it was.",0.9973,0.781,0.196,0.023,0.5397304210940572

SOOO yummy. Who does that? Serving beignets for free!  My dish was SO good - the Crab Cake Benedict might sound like a risky dish to order because you're not sure if the crab will taste fresh, but man oh man this dish tasted SOOO perfect.

The hollandaise sauce is perfect, the egg is perfectly cooked, the hash browns were delicately fried and flavored - basically  the combination of crab, egg, and potatoes, and  sauce was EXCELLENT and delicious. I've had this dish at other places and this was definitely WAY better. It is a pricey dish, about $16 but worth the experience.  Coffee is also pretty good here.  My friend ordered the Shrimp and Grits which came out as a soup - while tasty, it was not filling for even a gal!! She had to munch on other things to feel full.  My other friend ordered the pork sandwich on the lunch menu and she said that was really tasty as well.  For dessert, we had the famous red velvet cake  that my friend raved about and so did everyone on yelp - it was good but not like the absolutely best red velvet I've ever had, or anything. However, my friend said it tasted differently this time, but maybe the next we order it will be taste much better.  Lastly, their presentation of food is modern, delightful, and warms up your taste buds =)  Only negative in our case is that our service but super super slow, to the point where i had to wave down the waiter for the check.

2011-01-31,4.0,"*UPDATE* My wife and I went back and gave Big Jones another try.  We went in for brunch on a Sunday morning and left very happy.  The food was out of this world good.  The complimentary beignets were to die for.  I could have just eaten those all day long.   I ordered the crab cakes benedict.  This is one of my all-time favorite brunch dishes and this version was one of the best I have ever had.  My wife got the shrimp and grits. We both thought this dish was also quite delicious.  The coffee was also great as was the service.  We made reservations for 10 on a Sunday but probably didn't need them.  It seemed to start to get real busy at about 10:30.  This is probably our new favorite brunch place in the neighborhood (just passing M Henry).   I will admit that we probably just caught Big Jones on the wrong night before (see below).  We will definitely be back. __________________________________________ I would probably give 2.5 stars due to the owner offering to pay for our appetizers.  Overall our food was good. My wife and I had the crab cakes and pork belly for appetizers. Both were very tasty. Portions were quite small, especially for being $11 a piece. The remoulade with the crab cakes was especially delicious.  I ordered a couple of micro brews. Both were good. My wife said her wine was delicious. I had the cassolette which had sausage, pork belly and crispy duck. My dish was fantastic and quite filling. My wife ordered the chicken and dumplings and it was above average but nothing too special. The chicken was well cooked but not too flavorful and the one small dumpling didn't add anything to the dish. My wife was hoping for something a little closer to actual chicken and biscuits for her birthday dinner. This interpretation was lighter but nothing close to the real southern original. Quite a boring dish in our opinion.  The real reason for the 2 star review is the table we were seated at. Our table was seated parallel to the bar and about 2 feet from it. We spent our entire dinner staring at other peoples rear-ends and listening to their conversations. On top of that, our table was right next to the front door and it was FREEZING. The huge velvet curtains and two space heaters did nothing to warm up the area that we were sitting in. Almost as frustrating was the fact that we made reservations almost a month in advance and when my wife first got into the restaurant she said there were 2 or 3 open tables towards the back of the restaurant (I was still parking, because I would probably have asked to be moved. Once I sat down the restaurant was full).  I might be able to understand being sat up front if we were walk-ins, but not when we have made reservations well in advance.  It was a busy Saturday night and the front door was being opened non-stop. We were very cold all through dinner. One of the owners eventually came up to us and apologized for seating us so close to the crowd at the bar (he didn't mention the cold wind blowing across our table). He was very nice and took our appetizers off the bill. I hope the owners read this and realize that our table should not have been a table at all. It was far too close to the bar and the front door. Nobody forced to sit at that table in the middle of a Chicago winter is going to leave happy. We really felt like second class citizens after having made reservations 3.5 weeks in advance and still being sat at the front door when other open tables were available.  Like I said, this was my wife's birthday dinner and we were very disappointed. We had planned to stay for coffee and dessert but were so cold by the end of the meal that we just left. A note to the owners of Big Jones, please don't seat diners between the crowded bar and the front door when it is 15 degrees outside. You can almost guarantee that anybody that you sit at this table is not going to be a return customer.",0.9962,0.833,0.124,0.044,0.5085663585663586

I chose the sweet potato soup, excited that they didn't use a cream base (I assumed, since she said it could be made vegan.)  Until she said that the cheddar biscuits were vegan as long as you didn't add gravy... I'm not entirely sure she knew what vegan meant, and I probably should have said something, but they were really crowded and the soup was brought out almost right away, so I kind of figured the damage was done dairy-wise, and letting it go to waste wouldn't be much better.

Note on the EB: ordered the regular style (with Canadian bacon) because the fried green tomato version was out of season. Will have to come back for that one in the summer. Excellent EB, especially because it came on popovers instead of English muffins.  Coffee is Delicious and in large mugs. Huge selection of teas and even sweet teas. Really digging the creole French style of this place. Very short wait to be seated and the service was great- not slow, not too pushy, we arrived around 1pm and ate at our leisure.

Think of it as ""Grandma went to Le Cordon Bleu."" I left here feeling satisfied ... not just full or satiated, but with a feeling of happiness. Every aspect of the meal was well prepared, and the coffee kept me planted in my seat for longer than I probably should have stayed. Of course, the warm, doughy beignets didn't help either. Even though I've only been here for brunch, the drink menu looks spectacular -- enough to keep me occupied (and broke) for many a cold Chicago evening. I wish local bars were half so well stocked and mixed. A word to the wise, have patience if you go during peak hours (which is about at any time). The wait can have you standing in the cold, and the time to get your (delicious) meal agonizingly long. My only complaint was that the service was a bit lackluster, with my server almost timid about checking in (I had to work hard to catch his eye).

They serve you a carafe of iced tea and a small pitcher of simple syrup with your desired flavor to pour over a glass of ice. Fabulous! It all paired perfectly together.  After seeing the size of my husband's burger, I felt a bit jipped on the portion size, but it was sooo packed full of flavor I quickly forgot about it.

2010-12-28,5.0,"We like that Big Jones goes out of its way to source ingredients from farms that use humane methods to raise their animals.  The restaurant is transparent about the brands it uses--you can find many of the farms it buys from listed on the website and often on the menu as well.  We also asked our waiter about the sourcing of some of menu items and he was very knowledgeable and forthcoming.    Big Jones sources its pork from either Gunthorp Farms or Niman Ranch and its beef from Niman or Tallgrass Beef. Tallgrass Beef is completely grass-fed and grass-finished, meaning that the cows are never fed grain. Milk and dairy ingredients come from Kilgus Farmstead, Organic Valley, Prairie Fruits Farm, Trader's Point Creamery and Hook's. Prairie Fruits and Trader's Point are completely grass-fed operations while the others emphasize grazing and pasture-based living for their cows when the weather is hospitable (spring through autumn). The eggs used are organic and come from New Century Farm .  Laying hens that are raised organically are never raised in cages. Big Jones uses poultry that comes from Gunthorp Farms.  The birds spend a lot of their lives outside as they are pastured at three weeks of age. The Home Smoked Turkey Breast sandwich we ordered was delicious. Big Jones takes it a step further by butchering some of their meat, so that they can be sure of its origin and how the animals were raised. In our opinion, Big Jones is a very humane choice for those who eat animal products. Room for improvement: Consider sourcing beef products that are completely grass-fed and grass-finished to protect cattle health. The Humane Choice is a project of Food Animal Concerns Trust (FACT).

So when we got there and announced ourselves to the hostess, she drew open the velvet drapes, and let us into the dining room.  A bit Gone with the Wind, but I suppose a fitting welcome to the alluring room inside. To start, Crawfish Boudin, Piccalilli, Cayenne Mayo; and Oyster Stew, Fried Oysters, Tasso Ham, Crouton.  The fritters were chock full of crawfish.  The piccalilli gave a sharp tang to each bite.  The cayenne mayo though was surprisingly bland.  The oyster stew was poured tableside like a soup.  On the bowl were crisp battered fried oysters, grilled brioche, and slivers of tasso ham.  The stew was a thick puree that packed a punch, particularly the abundance of crushed celery seeds.  Very tasty. We were also presented with 3 cornbreads and a ramekin of sweet butter.  Soft pillowy sweetness.  It took incredible will power not to ask for more. For entrees. Fried Catfish, Celery Root Puree, Warm Lentil & Bacon Salad, Pickled Radish; and Laughing Bird Shrimp, House Tasso Gravy, Creamy Grits.  The catfish was gigantic and nicely fried.  The lentil and bacon salad; I want a bowl in my hand, a big spoon on the other, stare at the snow and just spoon that lusciousness into my mouth.  Over and over.  The celery root puree, while rich, gave the whole dish a sharp contrast.  The Shrimp & Grits was a revelation.  Tender, large shrimp.  A very rich gravy with mushrooms and bits of ham.  And the grits!  Creamy like no mashed potato can ever hope to be. Service was serviceable.  We were hesitant on wine, without knowing the spiciness of the dishes we had ordered.  All our waiter was able to suggest was to get a heavier white to pair with the richness of the food.  Not even pointing out which ones he would maybe recommend.  In the end, the Graves we picked, a dry, minerally pucker, was actually better in cutting through all that richness. Dessert looked just as rich as the savory items, if not more so.  On the other hand, there were about 20 different bourbon and rye on the beverage list.  Which one did I go for?  The Four Roses was extra smooth.  With a shot of hot water, it was my perfect amulet to go back out in the cold again.

2010-11-17,3.0,"Without going on at length about the abysmal service at Big Jones and thus rendering this review negative throughout I will note here that aside from the seating gaffs there was also the issue of empty coffee and hot water for tea, orders presented to the wrong persons, significant delays and lack of personality despite the restaurant being half empty, and a dessert order that required advanced notice was forgotten thus prolonging our frequently frigid stay by 30 minutes.  Those issues out of the way, I will now note that the setting was charming, the seating comfortable, and the concept/cooking quite appealing.  As described by chef/owner Paul Fehribach  ""I do what I do because I want to see nutrition, sustainability, and humane treatment of farm animals become the standard by which we judge food - not cheap price, industrial consistency, or marketing dollars spent. We can all eat better by treating the land and our animal friends better."" Warming up with the first of three cups of Intelligentsia orders were placed and the first item to arrive was the restaurant's signature complimentary beignets.  Served in a group of four and topped liberally (or sparsely if your point of comparison is Café du Monde) with powdered sugar the puffs of dough were toothsome on the exterior with a supple interior that melted in the mouth. For our appetizer selections we decided to share two of the myriad Low Country options - the first being Cracked Pepper and Goat Cheese Biscuits with Honey butter and house blueberry preserves.  Textural and buttery the biscuits were excellent with a distinct tanginess lent by the cheese.  Visually obvious I personally did not feel the pepper added much flavor to the dish but with that said the saccharine sweet honey butter and smooth preserves were excellent additions and served to highlight the cheese's nuances. The second appetizer, Cajun Pancakes with blueberry preserves and honey butter fared just as well as the biscuits and perhaps better.  Thin crepes with the butter folded inside the crispy yet light cakes were paired with powdered sugar and the same delectable preserves presented with the biscuits. Eschewing her love of sweet breakfasts my sister chise low country style corn cakes with cheddar cheese, vegetarian red beans, poached eggs, and green tomato chili sauce.  Far less spicy than I'd have imagined  the cakes themselves proved to be toothsome without being grainy and sweet without being sugary.  Topped with perfectly poached eggs whose yolks helped to balance the acidity of the tomatoes and rimmed by red beans the dish was certainly heavy but not so much that it was overwhelming. For my option, featuring house made Sally Lunn Bread, I selected the Sally Lunn French Toast with Brandied Harrow's Delight pears, Neiman Ranch applewood ham, and Michigan Maple syrup.  Sweet, Savory, and slightly boozy all at once this dish could have been a standout save for one thing - as well caramelized and eggy as the bread was, it was largely uncooked on the interior and more a grilled ham sandwich than French Toast.  Tasty for sure and featuring some of the best breakfast ham I've had in some time I simply prefer my French Toast with a more custard center. At this point our server returned to ask ""will there be anything else"" and when I mentioned the dessert order he admitted he had forgotten and apologized.  Asking if we would still be interested I assented and after another 30 minutes of chatting and drinking coffee the desserts would arrive - the first a house made Bourbon Bread Pudding with Autumn Apples, Salted caramel, and vanilla bean ice cream.  Considering myself something of a Bread Pudding Aficionado I have to say the flavor of the dish was quite good but the texture of the pudding was a tad stiff and the apples were underwhelming both it taste and texture.  With the vanilla bean ice-cream and the crumbled salted caramel propping up the dish I will simply say I was underwhelmed that this came from a restaurant proclaiming itself to represent Southern Costal Cuisine. Our final selection, and the reason for the delay, was the fresh baked Red Velvet Cake with cocoa, beet, and citrus plus cream cheese semifreddo.  What the dish lacked in presentation - essentially a puck of red velvet tilted up by the semifreddo and crumbles of salted caramel along side - it more than made up for in taste, texture, and temperature.  With the still steaming cake slowly melting the impossibly creamy and smooth semifreddo and caramel adding texture each bite was a different experience - cocoa, citrus, earthy, and entirely worth the wait - a dish that alone justifies a visit to Big Jones, even if just for dessert (perhaps after a Pizza at Great Lake?)

The meat itself was very dry.  Another big no no with pulled pork.  The meat is supposed to be tender as a result of the slow cooking of the meat over the BBQ.  The bread was soggy, flavorless and didn't hold the sandwhich together.  I wouldn't be surprised if it was a hamburger bun from the bread isle of jewel.  when I tried to eat is like a sandwhich the bottom of the bun was so mushy and soacked through that hald of the meat fell through and my fingers were covered in soggy bread.  Ewww gross.   The fries were not seasoned enough and were cold.

Big Jones got bumped up from 3 stars to 4. It's a lovely room, long and narrow but not the least bit tight. The wall of windows facing Clark Street help make it a bright, airy space. The food... is good. Not outstanding, but solid. Fried green tomatoes -- excellent. Crispy, tangy tomatoes in a creamy, spicy remoulade. Shrimp and grits -- good. I expected more from my shrimp... maybe more of them, maybe bigger ones... I don't know. It was tasty, but not completely satisfying. Pepper and goat cheese biscuits -- Wow. The goat cheese helped these little buggers brown a little more than your standard southern biscuit... and that's okay. Crunchy on the edges, fluffy in the middle. The rhubarb compote was a sweet counter to the peppery tang. Eggs New Orleans/Benedict -- I sampled both dishes at brunch and left happy and full. Both are built on a pop-over instead of the standard English muffin. The benedict added a nice piece of smoky ham, the New Orleans a moderately-mushy crab cake.

My fiance took me here for my birthday. Big Jones sent my a birthday card coupon for a free drink AND dessert, which I though was extremely generous.  Our server, Andy, was completely fantastic. Informative, attentive, pleasant, and sweet. He really enhanced the total dining experience. I really dislike when servers give you attitude and/or aren't very informed about the food. Andy explained the specials in a way that made you want them. He also told us in advance that if I wanted the red velvet cake for dessert it might take 15 min bc they make it once you order it. I appreciated the heads up. The other service was excellent as well - we went on a busy Sat night and our water was constantly filled, silverware and napkins replaced, table washed. Very impressive. I had the crab cakes for starters and cannot say enough about them: light, almost fluffy, with slightly tangy sauce, these were perfection. My mom, fiance and I ordered the house ground burger, which was just as good as I remember it. The bun is truly the perfect weight and the meat is super fresh and high quality. My brother got the bbq pulled pork sandwich, which was also fantastic - had just a slight vinegar taste, in a good way. We had the red velvet cake for dessert with the homemade ice cream and the cake was perfectly crispy on the outside and warm in the middle. The homemade ice cream was to die for.

When we walked in, it was beautiful and my wife says it's pretty typical of high end restaurants in the Quarter. We sat next to the wall nearly at the back by the back room. Which meant it was quieter. And they did have excellent drinks the kind that are en vogue right now: handcrafted and made-to-order. Delicious. And they'll take a little longer, but that's to be expected. As for the food, my wife reports that it's well done but not your typical fare. It's some high class food. Everything we had was great. We did the prix fixe for the evening mostly because we couldn't decide from the many inventive choices on the menu.

The fried green tomatoes were amazing! I loved it.  I also loved my friend's shrimp and grits more than I liked the eggs New Orleans that I got. Something about the bread they used for the eggs New Orleans didn't sit right with me. It was like a sweet dinner roll type of hamburger bun... I didn't like it. I tried eating the crab cakes by itself and it was too salty. In the end, I felt full from the corn bread and the tomatoes (and taking spoonfuls of my friend's delicious shrimp and grits -- they are much less oily than the shrimp and grits I ate in Atlanta and the shrimps tasted that much more fresher too -- strange because I had my first shrimp and grits at an organic restaurant).

The staff was great.  The host greeted us warmly and quickly.  We sat right away (which I pray won't change when everyone discovers how fabulous this place is!).  Our server Alex was wonderful, attentive & well groomed ;)  Not hover-y but attentive nonetheless.  I do have to say though, the tall male server assistant that filled are waters gave me the stank eye when I thanked him for filling our glasses.  what gives?! But Alex did more than make up for it. Now for the food.  A PLATE OF HOT, FLUFFY, POWDER SUGARY GOODNESS was placed in front of us. Here's the kicker: we didn't ask for them.  EVERYBODY GETS THEM!  Anyplace that sticks a plate of beignets just for coming in, is a winner in my book.  But the rest of the meal did not disappoint.  So here's the breakdown: beignets: freakin awesome. bloody mary: a little sour for my taste, but hubby liked cajun boudin fritters: delish! crunchy on the outside, moist and flavorful on the inside. reminiscent of arancini, but not as gummy because the rice is not risotto egg new orleans: yummy! crab cakes & bearnaise sauce were nicely seasoned. the only downside was that the popovers were overcooked therefore a little tough shrimp & grits: OMG. so damn good. grits were creamy. the shrimps were perfectly cooked. and the sauce... ooohh-wee that sauce.  at first glance you might think it would be overly seasoned & salty.  but the tasso ham is actually slightly sweet and there's a nice balance of flavors. one small side note- hubby got some 4 roses bourbon. is was quite a chintzy pour. a little heavier pour would be appreciated- even if it was only 1 in the afternoon. not trying to be nit-picky, but just a few little things that hopefully the owner(s) may take into consideration.  wasn't ""perfect"" and i don't necessarily think we ever look a ""perfect"" experience- we would rather have a warm & inviting meal than a cold & ""professional"" one.  so thank you Big Jones for giving us just that.  we'll see you again soon!

Only two things gave it a minus, a hair found in my food, and the fact the red velvet cake didn't really seem like actual red velvet cake (really it was delicious, still).  I came here on a Sunday afternoon and was seated quickly. We were given beignets to eat before our food came and we all ordered cocktails (mine being a corpse reviver) which were all great (and there is an amazing selection of liquors here).  I had the creole croque madame with grits, which was huge and unique from the traditional style with thicker ham and a bit of added spice. As well, the bread was really tasty and buttery. The red velvet cake for dessert really was delicious, but it just wasn't real red velvet cake. It tasted like homemade cake dyed red with food coloring -- so, good, but not red velvet.

2010-08-15,5.0,"I found this place randomly on yelp when i was looking for a local brunch place to take my father to while he was in town, and being from Edgewater, this spot was literally right down the road from me. I made a reservation through yelp just because i know how popular brunch is in this city and i didn't want to be hanging out to dry and looking like a dork in front of my dad. The Thursday morning we went it was very quiet in the restaurant and had a very southern charm to it right off the bat. Our waiter promptly brought home made corn bread that tasted like it had come out of the oven 5 minutes ago and had chunks of sweet corn right in the bread, served with honey butter...to die for.  There was a whiskey and gin menu which i thought was very impressive, but defaulted to my usual Tom Collins which was mixed to perfection. I took the crab cakes for an appetizer and they were unbeleivably deliciously fresh tasting, especially for a land locked state. It was almost as if they started a home made crab salad that they made into patties and then lightly seared in a superheated pan until firm enough to stick together as individual cakes but soft enough that you could cut them with a fork and have the pieces fall apart in your mouth. The cakes were accompanied with a spicy sauce that tasted like chipotle peppers.  For my main course i ordered a traditional Virgina pulled pork sandwich and my father ordered the Jambalaya ya-ya. Mine was great, not too messy and the BBQ sauce had that very acidic vinegar taste that you just cant get when the sauce isn't home made. The sandwich was served with house cabbage slaw; everything was delicious. My dad seemed very pleased with his meal and asked about the andouille sausage in his dish and was informed that all the sausage and boudin was made in house....impressive for being outside crawdad country.  We powered through our food and had enough room to share a piece of the house red velvet cake. This dessert is just another reason this place deserves 5 stars because it, like everything else we ate, was made right before it was served to us. The cake was not sliced off of a larger cake for the masses but was individually baked for our particular order and served with some of the richest, creamiest pecan ice cream i have ever tasted. You have not experienced superior southern food in this city until you eat here, the heavy coastal influences make this place a serious find for any foodie and sets it apart from southern wannabe's. Superior service, fresh tasting food prepared to perfection and finished minutes before being brought to our table, delicious cocktails and an inspired classical southern menu earns this place 5 stars. I assume that the menu rotates seasonally, as most restaurants of Big Jone's caliber do, so I will most definately be coming back to see what the lineup is for Fall/Winter.

The food is very good, kind of an odd combination of Low-Country South Carolina and New Orleans but it works.  My wife usually orders the crab cake Benedict and I usually order something else and the crab cake is almost always the best thing on the table and everything is pretty good.  The drinks are good, if you like a morning cocktail and the coffee is good too.

We enjoyed the 3-course lunch menu, which at about $20, I consider to be a decent value.  I was decidedly stuffed upon leaving, and all 3 of the courses (appetizer/main/dessert) were very generous.  I did not get the sense that anything was scaled back from what I may have received had I ordered things a la carte. The fried green tomatoes were yummy; if you like these, though, please do go and try them at Erwin on N Halsted as well.  My friend received a lot more dressing / remoulade than I, but the food was beautifully presented on both counts.  My gumbo was flavorful and completely filled to the brim of the wide soup bowl.  The server recommended the pulled pork sandwich (in part because of what is included on the side), and while I was not able to sample it, I would like to return for that.",0.9821,0.835,0.165,0.0,0.4003623188405797

My husband had just run a sprint triathalon (OMFG) and we were going out to brunch to celebrate. We had been up since 4am and we were super starvin'. We went to Big Jones, since you can't go wrong with New Orleans type of food.  We made a res and were seated immediately upon arrival. We both got huge cups of coffee, which was the best coffee I had in a long time. Did they put crack in it? It was addictive, rich, but not too bitter.  We got a plate of complimentary beignets, which were HEAAVEENNNLY. Piping hot, fluffy, fresh and coated in powdered sugar. They were gone in about 2 seconds. We both ordered (yeah, we're lame, but it was too good to pass up) the Eggs New Orleans. It was poached eggs, on top of crab cake, on a popover smothered in Bearnaise sauce. There were also fancy hash browned potatoes. Wow, the flavors certainly popped. The popover was hot and had the consistency of a croissant . The crab cake was rich and flavorful. The Bearnaise sauce was buttery and delicious, and the potatoes were just sassy. My only complaint was the egg, which had been poached for too long and the yolk was SOLID :( Total bummer. This is where I had to deduct a star.  I would go back here 100% for brunch, because that's where Big Jones seems to shine.

2010-07-24,4.0,"I've been here twice for brunch and was impressed both times!  Big Jones is Southern coastal cooking- I grew up in the Florida Panhandle and my family is from New Orleans, so I know the food.  Big Jones delivers.   One thing that struck me was how fresh all the ingredients tasted and how balanced the flavors in each dish were.  Big Jones relies on local and sustainable farms for most of their food, and I tasted the difference of that attention to detail in the food.   The beignets are not quite the same as you'd get in the French Quarter at Cafe du Monde- Big Jones gives them a bit of a tangier, yeastier flavor (almost like a sweet sourdough), but they are still a deliciously indulgent appetizer.  I've had the Eggs New Orleans and the Cheddar Corn Cakes.  Both were excellent, but I preferred the Eggs New Orleans- tasty crab cakes and an amazing sauce.  The Cheddar Corn Cakes were a bit on the salty side (granted I prefer less salt in general in favor of other spices), but overall yummy and more than satisfying.   My sister had the grits and loved 'em.  The sweet potato biscuits were okay, but a bit dry.   The staff has been very friendly and the service quick both times I've visited- other yelpers must have visited on busier days (although both of my visits were on weekends around 11:00am, seems prime time for brunch). Overall, I would recommend Big Jones for a change of pace for brunch.  If anyone in your party is vegetarian, however, most of the dishes will be off limits, as they often involve seafood or pork in one form or another.   I'm sure they'll still find something tasty, they just won't have as many options.",0.996,0.81,0.185,0.005,0.4428942199775533

But then the food started coming out. First was three cornbreads with butter, So yummy... with a smattering of whole corn kernels in them. There was a slight red pepper feel on the tip of the tongue and the cornbread was so soft and moist, it almost fell apart as you were picking it up. Mmmm, divine. For an appetizer we had the Cheddar-Herb Croquettes. Nice flavor and texture - it's served with Green Goddess dressing (I could drink that stuff by the mug full it's so good). The fiancé's entree was Shrimp and Grits (Laughing Bird Caribbean white shrimp, house tasso ham gravy, creamy grits). OhSoGood! He was a bit dismayed with the smallish serving size, but I think that by the time he was finished with his meal he was perfectly satisfied, and not the typical ""oh, I ate so much it hurts."" The flavors were amazing. He may have even had room for dessert, which *never* happens when we go out! I had the creamy cucumber gazpacho soup and the Roasted Fresh Hearts of Palm salad (cane-glazed pineapple, pea shoots, spiced peanuts, fried shallot, boiled peanut-ginger vinaigrette).

I also tried the gumbo, which I thought was pretty good as well (but the fried green tomatoes were better!). For my entree, I got the shrimp and grits -- amazing. My friend got the Eggs New Orleans, and she said that she had never had crab cakes that good. I definitely need to return so I can try those out. Try the sweet tea as well! They have a number of different flavors. I think I tried the peach and my friend had the passionfruit, and both were very refreshing. The tea comes in one glass pitcher, while the sweet syrup comes in a small beaker, so you can adjust the sweetness of your drink to your liking. They have unlimited refills, which is always nice.  Also, I had an alacard thing for $10 off $25 and also a coupon from a Yelp event for the same deal -- the waitress let me use one & my friend use the other! She was really attentive throughout the entire meal as well. We had a lot of leftover food (which happens when you order $50 worth between 2 people, I guess...) and they split up our food into boxes equally, so that we wouldn't have to do that at a later time -- really thoughtful of them.

I have to admit, I was a little intimidated by some of my choices. After looking the menu over several times, we decided to forgo entrees altogether and order several appetizers instead (I'm so glad we did). The server, who was very friendly and completely open to talk us through our choices, suggested we try the crab cakes. She also made several other recommendations based on their popularity. As a result we also ordered the fritters and the frog legs to go with the crab cakes. All the dishes arrived hot and every last one of them was delicious (even the frog legs...which I still can't believe I ate).

I would try again, especially for the brunch.   Parent Note -  They had a Children's Menu ($7 options) and plenty of high chairs, even though you could tell their other guests were a cautious of us walking in with a little 16 month old.  The woman behind the bar was very friendly and was making faces/small talk to our daughter!  My burger came with cajun fries, but they weren't overly spicy, so little Lily liked them and kept chomping down on them!  Didn't see a changing table, but really wasn't paying attention - Pregnancy Bladder!",0.9863,0.853,0.136,0.011,0.5455723905723904

For starters we had the pork belly and it was, literally, 'melt in your mouth.' I could have just had a couple plates of that for dinner. My wife had the shrimp and grits which was done perfectly. The shrimp were obviously fresh and not rubbery or 'fishy' tasting. The grits also had the proper amount of butter. It was decadent and wonderful. I had the pulled pork which was fantastic. Understand that this is North Carolina style which means it's going to have a sharp vinegary taste to it and cole slaw is *not* a side, it's a topping. This was very fresh pork and you could tell it had been slow cooked properly. It came with a side of fried okra, which is usually hit-or-miss for me. Here it was absolutely a hit. The waiter even brought me out a nice side sauce for it which made it out-of-sight. Others in our group had the ""Sweat Tea infused pork chop"" and they were very happy. The chop was cooked to perfection and I'm thinking I may try that again. Also, I'd encourage you to take a look at the drink menu. I had a tasty concoction called a Sazerac Rye which was outstanding but I would not suggest drinking more than one if you have to drive or walk any substantial distance as they are as potent as they are potable. My wife had the non-alcoholic Ginger Sweet Tea and it too was very good. I'd better wrap this up as I'm running out of positive adjectives to use.

2010-04-28,5.0,"Came last night for the ""lost Southern foods dinner.""  sponsored by Slow Food Chicago.  A great concept and a meal. We sat communally with some slow food regulars,  good conversation ranging from the Civil war to some Cheese shop in my hood that I was unaware of.  Chef Paul came out and explained about ingredients that are fast disappearing from our dinner tables,  Southern ones specifically.  From rice grains related to arborio to peas and charcuterie methods that are dying. Get to the food Bob! The first course advertised as  Sea Island red pea cappuccino,  was a soup of pureed red peas reminiscent of a black eyed pea,  but round and buttery in flavor,  speckled with puffed Carolina gold rice,  it was topped with a bacon foam and a pickled ramp.  I dove straight into the ramp,  I love ramps,  and it gave me flashbacks to some of my early culinary memories.  The bacon froth was subtle and amazing.  The puffed rice gave some texture to an earthy and well balanced first course. Second course was three different  house made charcuterie,  head cheese,  andouille,  and chaudin.  I had never heard of chaudin and was excited to get at it,  a pate'esque meat studded with rice,  kind of Boudin for the sophisticant.  The head cheese stole the show,  at my table there was some apprehension but once fork hit mouth it vanished.  The head cheese was not gelatinous in the least bit,  rich and meaty,  the flavor of pork was pure and unadulterated.  The andouille was the best I have ever had,  Chef Paul explained his difficulties in finding great Andouille which led him to make his own.  This tender subtle sausage was unlike the rubbery,  smoky  salty versions I have had.  As if these three things were not enough they were topped with a couple of whole grain mustards,  a ""chow chow"" (Chef referred to it as a relish but my old farmer in NC would have called that a chow chow and threatened a beating if you called it any thing else.)  There was also a touch of pickled cabbage and a slice of Pan Perdu.  Then the dish was topped,  as if it needed anything else,  with a pickled Laughing Bird shrimp,  sweet,  crispy and delicious. Third course,  a simple salad that gave the pallet time to recover,  shaved asparagus,  lettuce and black benne paste ( a type of sesame seed)  the salad was light and refreshing. Fourth,  a Duck Gumbo.  Any traditionalist knows that gumbo is all about the roux,  just about anything can go in,  as long as ""in"" has a roux.  After the meal Chef explained he made the roux with duck fat which has a fairly high smoke point and is the reason for the incredible depth of flavor.  Another example of Chef Paul's dedication to Southern food culture is his Tasso ham which of course they make in house,  lean slightly smoky from hanging over smoldering pecan wood.  On top of the gumbo were hot and sour mustard greens,  amazing!  Every time I get greens I say ""damn these are the best greens ever""  and rarely am I in the South.    Popcorn rice was served in the gumbo and was aromatic and buttery. Dessert,   Calas, Pumpkin Seed Pralines, Lemon Ice Cream, and coconut foam. Don't know what calas are? Wikipedia calls them rice cakes,  but that does not do them justice,  they are crispy,  slightly chewy, rich and covered in powdered sugar quite addicting.  The pralines (pronounced Praw-leens in the South)  were amazing as well,  chewy,  caramel and nutty,  they were perfectly matched with the lemon ice cream and the coconut foam.   This meal in some ways was exactly like dining in the South,   A wonderful host that spent days preparing your food and effortlessly serves it up with good conversation and great libation.  I left this event satisfied,  home sick,  angry (I am always angry) full,  motivated and in awe.  Chefs need a vision to truly show what they are capable of,  this was Chef Paul's Magnum Opus.  For now any way.",0.9983,0.794,0.158,0.048,0.5025701239399868

The hostess recognized our reservation still and took pity on us and sat us at the table they were holding for us by the window.

The only other time I had had them was at the one and only Cafe Du Monde during a visit to NOLA over 6 years before. They were as good as I remembered them, although I am sure there are variances in the recipe that a native would distinguish. With so many a la carte items at brunches, its nice to get something complimentary and much better than a plate of bread! We did not order any appetizers although if I went back I'd try the fried green tomatoes and share an entree. My husband got the cheesy corn cakes served with salsa verde, eggs any way you like it, black beans, guac and some sour cream. While not my style, he loved it. I ordered the Eggs New Orleans--their take on Eggs Benedict, subbing in puff popovers for English Muffins and adding in crab cakes with Potatoes O'Brien. Everything was great. The eggs were just the right amount! I would definitely order it again. My only wish is that the crab cake was bigger of the popover smaller so that you could take a bite and get the same amount of everything on your fork and in your mouth. I did have one whole egg tower of goodness leftover which was amazing the next day after a quick broil! Overall, I liked the menu because it was savory heavy.

There was an issue requesting scrambled eggs instead of poached on one of the Eggs New Orleans (""I'm not sure if we can do that, I'll have to clear that with Chef first"", the server stated. -- Note: She did not refer to him as ""the Chef"", but as ""Chef"") and  for the kid's meal there was an issue with figuring out what veggie sticks were (whether raw, cooked, potato-chip-ish or what) and he ended up getting served french fries despite a lengthy discussion regarding interest in the veggie sticks. Ordering was an irritating experience as the waitress didn't know how to describe ANY of the food or drinks we had questions about, and then made us feel like we were the biggest jerks on the planet for wasting her time and ""altering"" the Chef's Masterpiece. It was silly that one would have to ""ask Chef"" as to whether or not my eggs could be scrambled. They are eggs. There are a bunch of other dishes that offer scrambled eggs-- so I'm not asking for them to be stirred with a unicorn horn or anything ridiculous.  All but one drink arrived, as they were ""working on"" the Bloody Mary that was ordered (it arrived about ten minutes later)...and once we got our food (which was delicious) my friend asked the waitress to order a Creole Croque Madame to go for her husband who was unable to join us. At this point, every table around us had packed up their little to-go boxes and left, we were the only people in the back room. The waitress came back a few minutes later and told us that Chef would not make the Creole Croque Madame, and that they could not fulfill to-go orders as there were too many customers to serve. Really!? Too busy to make an entree. Why not just make the sandwich and stick it in a box?! Had we ordered dessert would we not have been able to receive it? Or would they have been ""too busy"" to make that as well?  Please tell ""Chef"" that he needs to hire competent a waitstaff and that if a customer would like to order something off the menu they should be able to receive it-- scrambled, in a box, or any other way within reason. And what the hell are Veggie Sticks?! We never did find out. - Don't refer to someone I don't know as ""Chef""...unless his first name is Chef...just say ""the chef"" - Know your menu and be able to explain it if you're a server - Allow your customers to order what they want! Turning away orders is absurd. - In response to the owner's comment: We didn't feel the ""happy to fulfill requests"" vibe in the least.",0.8898,0.847,0.087,0.067,0.45679551929551926
2010-04-16,3.0,"I took the BF here for brunch on his B-Day because of their presence at Yelp Fantasea where my 'Mel' fell in LOVE with Big Jones.  All in all, our meal was pretty good (maybe borderline okay) and the service was peculiar at best. With breakfast at $80 for 2 people and only one bloody mary, I will likely not be back... not with service that weirds me out, at least.  Our server was so bizarre. Like children of the corn bizarre. We would order, we would say thank you upon her dropping food off and taking plates away and she would not respond at all. Just had a weird smirk on  her face. She didn't seem crabby, just seemed like she disliked customers. As one of only 2 tables in the place, I'd say that she was not super busy and not taking out a busy brunch on us. Really though, if you ordered food at a restaurant and all the server did was stare at you, down at her notepad and then walk away, you'd be uncomfortable too. I like a little acknowledgement, just a little. please.  For breakfast we got a mixture of things, including: The Beignets: Fabulous! Defo the hit of the meal. How can you go wrong with sugary, fluffy, doughy delights like these.  The gumbo ya ya- BF thoroughly enjoyed - but he likes all gumbo, really. The Eggs New Orleans, Lump crab cakes on fresh popovers with poached eggs, béarnaise sauce, and potatoes O'Brie.  They were sooo very dry and almost sandy tasting. Can't say I was a fan, at all. The Lafourche, which is a Louisiana crawfish, jalapeno, wild mushrooms, cream cheese, bearnaise sauce. I couldn't taste the jalapenos at all, the bearnaise sauce was bland and overall, tasted like something I could've gotten at a much lesser restaurant.  The service was certainly 2 stars and was best summed up when the other (and only) table in the restaurant, who was sat directly next to us, said, ""maybe we should go, I don't think they want us here"" after the server begrudgingly took their drink order and would answer their questions with blank stares and short, terse, one word answers. The food was a 3 - 3.5. For the price and flavor together it was just not a hit. Nothing was bad but nothing was as fantastic as I had been expecting.  The ambiance and decor were great though. Had the the service been better, I could probably ignore that our food was just okay and give the 4 star bump but sadly, that was not the case and the poor attitude of our server very much dictated how we felt about our meal.",0.9576,0.797,0.121,0.082,0.555814305520188
2010-04-02,5.0,"I love Southern food. I grew up eating it, eat it every time I go home to Texas, stockpile recipes in my head to make for myself when I've been good, and when I hear of a good Southern food restaurant far away from the South I have to go.  Big Jones hits the nail on the head again and again. The service is friendly. Not Southern friendly, but still, oh so nice. The corn cakes are great. I've yet to dunk them in a bowl of gumbo (shame on me), but the crumbly bread is perfect for a salty roux. Fried green tomatoes are exactly what the name implies. Don't expect a green tomato to knock your socks off, but if it's fried in a cornmeal batter and sprinkled with a little salt, it just might come close. Put it on a sandwich with some butter lettuce and bacon and you've got yourself a meal. But the thing I can't get over, the thing I daydream about, is the shrimp and grits. The shrimp are plump and sweet and as fresh as can be. And I didn't dare ask how they got their grits so creamy - butter, cream, cheese, all of the above.  The chef is happy to make something you don't see on the menu, but they've made before (say, fried catfish and eggs on a Wednesday afternoon); the servers make excellent recommendations (ginger sweet tea); and if you eye that bottle of champagne that the bartender is pouring into delicate glasses just right, she'll probably slide a taste of it your way.",0.9944,0.818,0.182,0.0,0.5334285714285715

Oh well, I was still excited to try the restaurant.  When you sit down they give you some beignets - while they were sugary and dough-y, I wished they had been a little less chewy.  Having said that, we finished the entire plate because they were still pretty good.   I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with lemonade - and the lemonade tasted like freshly squeezed lemons.  Not as sweet as I would have liked, but at least it wasn't artificial tasting.  The pulled pork sauce had basically obliterated the bottom part of the bun making it impossible to eat without a fork/knife - strike 2.  Then I took a bite of the pulled pork and unfortunately it was a little dry and very vinegar-y.  My husband ordered the crab cake salad, and the salad dressing had an overpowering vinegar taste too.  Not sure if this was the taste they were going for?  Well anyway, strike 3.  Was not a huge fan of either dish.   However, LOVED the fried okra I ordered with my sandwich - came with this creamy pesto (?) sauce that was delicious.   I was a little disappointed after reading all of the great reviews on Yelp, but maybe we just ordered the wrong items?",0.9882,0.74,0.187,0.073,0.6877572016460906

I'm going to tell you a little secret, you can make brunch reservations for Big Jones on Open Table (thank yous in the form of drinks are always appreciated).  I arrived late (surprise, surprise) and was greeted with some beignets on the table. I didn't notice them on the menu, so I'll venture to say it was a little lagniappe - very nice touch. They were wonderful, airy, sweet balls of dough, not overly fried or oily like many I've tried. If they made this a menu item, I would've totally ordered a plate for myself. Or, if I had arrived first to brunch I might have eaten the whole plate and denied their existence when the others arrived, despite any telltale powdered sugar evidence. Who knows?  Anyway, for my meal I ordered the Cajun Pancakes and a mimosa. When I think cajun, I think spice; I know it's not accurate, but usually in the Midwest that's what you can expect to get. Not true at Big Jones, as the server explained they were crepe-like pancakes served with preserves, powdered sugar and cane syrup. They are a bit thicker than crepes, reminding me of the Palacsinta or Hungarian pancakes I grew up on. Presentation-wise, they were definitely the most boring looking dish on our table, but taste-wise I was quite pleased. I tried a bite of my friend's buckwheat pancakes; while they generously filled out her plate, they really didn't wow me at all. Rather bland, in my opinion.  My mimosa was fabulous, a great balance of champagne and what seemed like freshly squeezed OJ, definitely not Tropicana. If I could have afforded it, I would knocked back about 4 more of these.  Since I arrived late, I didn't have much of a chance to check out my surroundings. The room is long and narrow, bright with a quaint Southern charm. Our table wasn't my favorite, right by the door and close to a curtain cordoning off the waiting area.

Fried Green Tomatoes Three Sisters Garden cornmeal breading, pickled shrimp, remoulade  - this was not all that great. The sauce was just okay, and the shrimp was a bit over cooked, but the tomatoes were just disappointing.   Sugarcane-Cured Pork Belly Gunthorp farm pork, Johnny cakes, plum ketchup, chow-chow - This was pretty good, the pork didn't have much flavor, but with the plum ketchup it was very tasty.  The Johnny cakes were very fluffy and comforting.  So good. Entree: Sweet Tea Infused Pork Chop center-cut Niman Ranch chop, baked bean puree, sweet potato hash -  this was good.  The pork chops were cooked medium well, and it was very tender.  The sweet potatoes and crispy bacon strips made this dish feel more southern. Gumbo Ya-Ya Chicken, Andouille, and trinity in a traditional dark roux, with popcorn rice  - this was kind of disappointing.  My hubby hardly ate half.  The gumbo was a bit too thick, and the flavor was very commercial like Zatarain's.  So, I wouldn't order this again. Now, the very best thing in the house was definitely their fresh cornbread.  These were so good that we asked for refills.  They were warm with real white kernel inside.  My hubby that usually hate cornbread because of its dryness went gaga over these.

Big Jones has really stepped up their game in the past year.  They have been good with discounts while the economy has been bad.  We had the $10 coupon that they let us keep reusing throughout last year.  As I mentioned before, the food porn presentations were cool in part because they were not expected.  This place has really grown on us.",0.9538,0.854,0.102,0.044,0.4092592592592592

2010-03-05,3.0,"Okay, I would've said ""Yay! I'm a fan"" (4 stars) only when I went to dip into my yummy leftovers - still yummy ice cold, btw - they had only packaged the meat and not the sides! I was more excited for the cheesy grits and greens this morning than the catfish (which was still plump and moist out of the fridge), but alas, the busboy made the executive decision that I wouldn't want it. My group and I were so full after sampling so many apps (I will get to those) that I barely touched the entree, so it was a HUGE disappointment to not get the grits and greens that had come w/ my meal.   ]o: The apps we tried ... fried green tomatoes, crawfish fritters, frog legs, cheddar croquettes, & house boucherie ... Fried Green Tomatoes: LOVED them! My friend Keren thought they were too hard, but a green tomato is unripe and hard by nature. I don't think I'd want a flavorful, crispy outside followed by a hot, mushy inside. The tomato being of a hearty consistency worked for me and my hubby. PS: The remolaude was FAN-TAS-TIC!  Crawfish Fritters: Not a fan of these. Keren's & my hubby liked them, but K thought they tasted too fishy, and I thought they were more falafel than fritter. Froglegs: Tastes just like chicken! (Only chewier.) Seriously, it was a good experience having never tried them before. The bread-coating may've been a little too much though, it took away from the meat, but the legs were served with another KILLER sauce - sort of a marsala take that we all sopped up with the bread. Cheddar Croquettes: I really dug this one - crispy, flavorful outside, gooey, cheesy inside, & accompanied by another yummy sauce, like a mix b/w a green godess dressing and jalapeños. (This joint really should jar and sell their sauces!)  K had a different idea of what a croqutte should be - something more along the lines of a puff pastry - but the deep-fried preparation rang true to me. House Boucherie: My hubby had asked for a small sample of the head cheese first which the waitress happily obliged. I tried head cheese for the first time in my life, folks, and it was scrumptious! There was a slight consistency issue at first (half lunchmeat, half jello-y), but when the taste expanded, I really enjoyed it! It was zesty like a good deli Genoa salami and the gents loved it equally. All the meats and pickled veggies on the platter are made in-house and you could really taste the quality.   Entrees we tried ... gumbo, pecan catfish, peach tea pork chop, shrimp & grits, benne chicken ... Gumbo: So I'm used to Zatarain's (what I use @ home) and I was initially put off by the deep brown color and hit-you-over-the-head bold flavor @ Big Jones, but after I got over the side-by-side comparison, I really enjoyed Big Jones' gumbo and there was definitely an authenticity about it. Pecan Catfish: My entree. The one that was sent home sans grits & greens. The catfish was plump and juicy and well seasoned and not at all fishy tasting. I thought there would be more pecan flavor infused into the pan-fried breaded sear, but there were plenty of crunchy, sauteed pecans embellishing the plate. The grits were a little stiffer than I had anticipated, but I attributed that to all the cheese. They were tasty on their own w/out me salt-and-peppering (which weren't even on the tables). The greens were sweet and sassy and simply delicious.  Peach Tea Pork Chop: This chop could stand next to ANY steak and hold it's own. Served medium-rare-to-medium, it was a tender, savory, healthy portion adorned with cubed sweet potatoes in a thick, sweet gravy/sauce that spoke very southern to me.  Shrimp & Grits: K's hubby ordered this one. He felt like it was a titch cold, but he acknowledged that it was probably prepared first and waiting on the others. He stirred it around and the creaminess was quickly restored and he said it was very good. If this was served with the same shrimp that adorned the green tomatoes app (I had forgot to mention that), I gotta believe it was excellent.   Benne Chicken: K ordered this dish and wasn't madly in love w/ it. Granted, we were full from the apps, but her reaction to it was pretty reserved. She said the chicken was good, but she didn't like the sauce. I went home with her leftover chicken, and honestly, it was just average.  Decor ... fancier than I expected. I'd rather a grittier appearance, but it was nice.  Service ... the waitress was great and accomodating. She forgot one cocktail round, but she laughed at her own ""oops"" in a way that was forgiving and endearing. The busser on the other hand was attentive to the point of being near annoying. The restaurant swaps out silverware/plates after every course and for me, it was too much. I love exemplary  customer service, but in this case, the above and beyond was intrusive. We'd be in the middle of an antimated conversation, and he'd be up in us clearing the table ruining the moment, not to mention, leaving a crucial part of my entree out of the to-go package.",0.9993,0.782,0.18,0.038,0.5598529411764707

Now, the reason I had to give it 3 stars is because our entrees weren't that great.  My boyfriend got the gumbo, and it wasn't at all what he wanted in gumbo.  He said it tasted more like chili, or sloppy joe.  So, not the best.  I got the only vegetarian entree, which I can't remember the name of and it's not on the website's menu, but it was some type of grain-ish thing, kind of like rice, with vegetables and absinthe soaked raisins.  My problem with this dish was the another reason why my boyfriend didn't like the gumbo-- it was EXTREMELY salty.  Almost too salty to eat... and I like salt, so yes, it was very salty.  I wasn't that happy about it.

A little pricey for the amount you get, but they weren't the least bit greasy or heavy. A good start.   The gumbo was outstanding. My wife said she could have easily been satisfied ordering another bowl for her entrée. They give out a complimentary basket of corn cakes, so that was a nice touch. We went with the burger. It was melt in your mouth delicious. Well worth the trip just for that. Our other entrée was the pork shoulder sandwich which was just ok. It was Carolina style, so the sauce was more tangy than sweet. Nothing too great and paled in comparison to the burger. We were too stuffed for dessert, but we'll try some next time.

Anyways, my girlfriend and I both ordered the tall grass burger which came with fontina cheese, grilled onions and mushrooms and a garlic aioli.  We got the aioli on the side, per the server's recommendation, and the burgers were fabulous.   Next time I will try the breakfast, as I was staring at other people's dishes and they looked quite good.  I would definitely recommend this place - but make sure to be adamant about service.  I got the feel that we may have been forgotten back in our corner if we didn't speak up.",0.9844,0.811,0.139,0.05,0.4700694444444445

2010-01-29,3.0,"I am a southern boy. I love southern food, soul food, southern comfort food, etc. My momma is well known and regarded for her soul food straight from the low country of South Carolina. Given that, I enjoyed the food at Big Jones. The dishes were flavorful and inventive. However I do take issue with the accompanying pretentious and price. And I assure that some of the things good southern food is NOT is pretentious or pricey. It comes from the soul. It's made with cheap ingredients. Have you ever shopped for catfish, collard greens, sweet potatoes or cabbage? There are some of the cheapest things you can find. I don't knock them for putting  twist on the classics but altering the essence of the dish and charging a buttload for it goes against the heart of southern cooking.  If you do give Big Jones a 'go' I recommend the Chef's special of the day. The three courses gives you a chance to try different dishes. I started with a bitter green salad with a vinaigrette. (Never heard of it in southern cooking but oh well.) It was good but didn't remind me of anything remotely southern. The cornbread was a little dry and unimpressive. My entire was a great southern staple of fish and grits. I had the blackened catfish with smooth & velvety cheese grits. This dish was spot on...except for a weird and overly sweet pecan sauce over top of the fish. Next time I would order it without the pecan glaze and save it for some pancakes. I finished my meal with red velvet cake. It was good but not necessarily noteworthy. The question remains: would I return? The answer is yes if my momma came to town.

While the service was relatively friendly and the atmosphere was nice, the food left much to be desired. My turducken was pretty dry, and the brussel sprouts that came with it were the most bitter brussel sprouts I'd ever had -- and I am a huge brussel sprouts fan and have rarely been disappointed by them in the past. The gravy that was served with the turducken also seemed like it came from a gravy packet instead of being freshly made. The red velvet cake I had at the end of the meal seemed pretty ordinary, and nothing really stood out about it.

2010-01-14,4.0,"I was really torn on this review, and frankly I think 3.5 stars would be just about right for this first visit.  But alas, as many people have pointed out, we can't award half stars, so I'm going to err on the side of generosity in this instance, and I'll tell you why... Big Jones is a nice place.  It's kind of pretty, though the decor is odd, a mix of contemporary and ersatz antique that never quite meshed for me.  The staff was friendly, attentive and helpful, but the kitchen was slower than the seven year itch in spite of the restaurant being not even 25% full when we were there.  And in spite of there being a lot of available tables, we ended up being seated between two other parties so that I, at least, was always aware of what was being eaten or said on either side of us. The gumbo was fine.  It wasn't either spectacular or terrible; it had a nice spice to it, and the andouille sausage was tasty.  But it was too salty for my taste.  The pork belly was excellent, the shrimp with cheese grits and tasso ham gravy was good, but not compelling enough to make me clean my plate.  What was compelling was the bread pudding, which was remarkably good, with a touch of satsuma liqueur.  The pudding itself was finely textured, more like cake than bread, and it did make me clean my plate.  I was thrilled to see an Abita beer (Turbodog) on the menu, but only the one, which I thought was a shame.  I don't drink sweet tea, but two of the three glasses brought to the table were pronounced excellent.  The third needed stirring, and my southern friends rolled their eyes a bit over that. Personally, I found the tension between down home and upscale sort of problematic.  When you think of good Cajun food you don't think about getting a big white plate with a couple of morsels of food the waiter has to explain.  I don't really want to hear words like ""reduction"" or ""confit"" about what's lying there in front of me because Cajun food isn't frou-frou, it isn't refined.  It's the stuff that you could just as easily order at a roadside stand as in a fancy restaurant.  And no, there's nothing wrong with taking it up a few notches, but it doesn't pay to forget where this food comes from. What won the fourth full star?  In the words of the executive chef and co-owner:  ""I do what I do because I want to see nutrition, sustainability, and humane treatment of farm animals become the standard by which we judge food - not cheap price, industrial consistency, or marketing dollars spent. We can all eat better by treating the land and our animal friends better.""  And that, my friends, is worth a lot to me.   So yeah, I'm a fan.  I'm not a mad, proselytizing fan, but I am a fan nonetheless.  If they could reconcile some of the conflicting notes and get the kitchen moving a little faster, this place would really be a winner.",0.9964,0.727,0.187,0.087,0.5093153080441216
2010-01-10,5.0,"Big Jones Big Frog Legs Big Deep Fried Mashed Potato While Big Jones likely is known for its brunch, I made an online reservation courtesy of their web site ( bigjoneschicago.com ) that set it up through Open Table for dinner. Upon arriving for 7:30pm for dinner my jaw dropped as there was only one other group eating in the restaurant! Had Yelp been wrong? Had my hopes been dashed? Should I have gone for brunch instead of dinner? Some Big Easy music played in the background and I sat waiting for the rest of my group. The problem of emptiness soon rectified itself as people started filling the seats, mind you it was a snowy mess outside and difficult to park with all the mess out there. I ordered a Jasmine Blossom Tea for my hurting throat and it was magnificent. Brought to me in a small glass teapot, there was a Jasmine Blossom in hot water and the water turned to tea and I was delighted with bagless tea! Now to the nitty gritty: Fried Frog Legs: $12 These four frog legs came in a delicious orange sauce breaded crisp like Popeye's without sacrificing the integrity of the reptilian meat. Reptilian these legs did nary taste and delightful it was to sink my teeth into fried crispiness of fine southern frog legs! The most amazing thing of this dish is not the frog legs or the sauce itself. I found myself savoring every last bit of mushroom that accompanied my frog legs because the mushrooms packed a dense flavor of sweetness, sourness, and a saucy air of miracle about it. Mad props to the wizards of Big Jones as I wish I had ordered two or three orders of frog leg! Tallgrass Beef Burger - $14 The burger came with a healthy portion of cajun fries loaded up with herbs and spices that was a bit overwhelming. Fortunately for me, these fries came with garlic aioli similar to what you'd find at Hopleaf, so I could dip the fries in and not be inundated by the multitude of herbs on these fries. The burger itself was large and came on an interesting roll/bun kind of tasting like potato bread. The burger was very soft and tasted delightful. The softness of the burger and the onions made it comforting to eat. I took it home for leftovers and ate it cold since it was so tasty! Deep Fried Mash Potato - $4 Generally, these mash potatoes come with the steak, but I couldn't feel good about myself if I left without trying some! They made me a giant helping of deep fried mash potato as a side and I was able to split it with the other four people sitting at my table so that we could all have a little. Delightfully breaded but a bit oversalty. This dish would be ideal with some gravy to offset the saltiness of the crust.  There was so much food all around I got to sample some halibut, gumbo, and some of the free cornbread. For dessert we rocked the cool Sweet Potato-Sorghum Pie with some ice cream in it and some fresh out the oven Mississippi Mud Pie. During dinner I can swear I drank 12 cups of tea and ungodly amounts of water. I really can't remember the last time I ever went out and had a 2.5 hour dinner on an idle Thursday for no good reason at all. Marvelous food and a great time to be had in these doors.

I know that some of these buildings are tough to heat, but you might need to upgrade, especially toward the front of the restaurant, or install a proper air lock (like on Star Trek, the original edition). That said, I think you're going to get a 4-5 star taste here, even if you ordered at random. For me, there are several things I could have ordered on the menu. But it's all about the gumbo when it comes to my interest in this cuisine. The last gumbo I had here in Chicago, I think, was at Heaven on 7. It was good but didn't leave me feeling like I was on my trip to New Orleans, pre-Katrina. And I'm sure that they're still cooking it up down there, God bless 'em. The gumbo at Big Jones had such good texture and deep color that I thought I was enjoying an Indian curry. The Andouille sausage was to die for, and you can order the gumbo here as a bowl or a meal (which includes a big dollop of rice in the middle). The gumbo is 5 stars in my book. Our meal came with complimentary corn bread, and it's one of the best I've had. Let's face it though, almost anything as buttery smooth as this corn bread is going to taste good. Nevertheless, we both loved it, and you will, too. Anyway, I think the food here is pretty authentic but don't claim to be an expert. Whatever lack of authenticity may exist is compensated for by using sustainable and organic ingredients (in most, and possibly all cases).  Considering this aspect, the prices here are reasonable. Now if we can get the heating under control in the winter, we'll be all set. Perhaps they keep it cool so we can handle the gumbo.",0.9957,0.785,0.18,0.035,0.5206764615855524

The salad, with palm hearts and a tasty dressing was pretty good. The steak was cooked to perfection and had good flavor, and was tender The creamed spinach with tomatoes was shockingly excellent Good selection of local beers Cons: Small children in the back room? Seriously, you are going to shove a small child with us back in the cramped ""party room""? Not cool. Thankfully the child fell asleep during the meal. They ran out of fried mashed potatoes - which was supposed to come with the steak. I was pretty sad as I had been looking forward to them. The other potato options were fries and hashbrowns. Seriously, with the amount I paid you were going to give me FRIES? I got them, and was highly disappointed. The entrees took FOREVER. At least 30 minutes if not more. We were compensated with a round of free drinks, which was nice. The waitress kept forgetting to bring us water, or ask us if we wanted more beer. I know it was busy, but they had ample staff. At least she was nice. My friend asked for her steak well done, and it was brought out medium rare. I know this is how the steak is ""supposed"" to be enjoyed, but give the lady what she wants! The steak was already sliced, and we would have had to wait forever for them to fire a whole new steak. There was no whipped cream on the sweet potato pie, which it desperately needed, especially when it was served with a pepper jelly ice cream.

2009-12-11,3.0,"Three stars for the inconsistent food, but something about the place that makes me want to come back. We rarely wander up to Andersonville, but since we were going to be in the area at Aragon we thought we'd try something nearby. I found out about this place bc it was one of the restaurants from the A La Card deck. I was excited to try some Southern food. We walked in and it was totally not what I expected. I was pleasantly surprised by the decor. It was classy, simple, yet rich and warm. The long velvet curtains were like the ones at Violet Hour. Unfortunately we sat at a table near the door and there was a constant draft of cold air. I had to keep my coat on the whole time. I warmed myself up with this beautiful tea. I love the jasmine teas that start out like a gumball and then open up beautifully in the water. We started out with some fried green tomatoes. The portions were pretty large for appetizers. The fried green tomatoes were nicely cooked with a crispy cornmeal crust, but could use a bit more salt. The pickled shrimp overpowered the tomatoes. The complimentary corn bread was light and moist. These were one of the highlights of the meal. They were warm and delicious. The pork belly appetizer was good but not great. It needed more salt and once again was overpowered by the pickled vegetables. The pork shoulder sandwhich was a mound of meat on a heavily buttered roll with a heap of cole slaw. The slaw was great. The meat was a tad too tart for me. It seems like they are really into pickling and tart flavors. The okra was nicely breaded and fried. The halibut was perfectly cooked. It was flavorful and flaky. The mustard sauce was a great addition. The pickled red cabbage (again with the pickling) were too strong and the sweet potato pancake underneath couldn't hold up to the cabbage.Overall, I loved the decor, vibe, and service. The food for me was close but no cigar. Most everything was a bit under seasoned and could be greatly improved simply by adding salt. The pickling was reoccurred too much and was overpowering. Despite all this, I would actually come back. Maybe brunch is better. It's worth a shot.",0.9986,0.708,0.252,0.041,0.5709344115004493
2009-12-09,3.0,"I am a tough critic when it comes to Southern/NOLA food.  I was born/raised in Kentucky, grad schooled in Tennessee and first-jobbed in Louisiana.  I have been there and done that when it comes to this food.  If you want to win my love, you got to show me something new and really wow me.  If a 'Big Mama' could make it better, I won't be impressed.  Big Jones is a nice intro to this kind of fare, but I wasn't blown away. The great: the beignets.  These were done just right.  They were fluffy, hot, the right size and topped with just enough powdered sugar to make you look like you used the restroom at Studio 54.  I could have made a meal of these and, in sadder days, I have.  Also great: the tea.  I ordered a fruit tea that I could make to my tastes.  I loved it.  I could add as much (never 'as little') syrup to my tea to make it super sweet and fruity (that didn't come out right).  Remember: unsweetened tea is, simply, brown water.  I also liked the decor.  It's inviting and comfortable without being too kitschy. The good, not great: everything else.  Nothing else here was bad but nothing else wowed me.  If I weren't already so familiar with the food, I think I would have a different impression.  Our server was attentive, tried hard and made sure that we were happy from the time we sat (and moved out of the path of cold air blasting into the restaurant) to the time we left.  I ordered the banana pancakes.  My dad used to make banana pancakes all the time when I was a kid.  His were awesome...and better than Big Jones'.  They were well-sized and came with lots of caramel and vanilla sauce and butter, but they were a little dry and the almond component of the dish was disappointing.  Rather than being inside the cakes, the almonds were atop the cakes.  Not a huge deal, but different from what I expected.  I wanted to race through eating this dish and, as it was, I sort of lollygagged.  To Big Jones' credit, my dining companions (one, a Southerner) greatly enjoyed their meals. I had a pleasant time at Big Jones.  It was a nice way to spend a lazy Saturday morning.  Would I trek up to Andersonville for a second round?  Probably not - not with so many other great brunch options in the city.",0.9975,0.731,0.212,0.058,0.5992582466266678

First of all, after reading my first Yelp review, the owners contacted us, apologizing profusely for the misunderstanding, and also sent a lovely invitation to bring our friend out (who didn't make the first brunch) for brunch/lunch on them.  Over the top customer service!  THAT is what I'm talking about people!!!  SO nice. Second of all, we've been back twice for weekday brunch/lunch since.  Once was with a group of 8 or 10 people in July.  The other time was a few days ago, we took my mom there for her birthday.  The waiter overheard us wish her a happy birthday when our food came, and when we were done eating presented us with a piece of red velvet cake (on the house) with a candle in it!  So sweet!  And oh my god - SO good.  It had a cream cheese semi-freddo on the side - the perfect match.  The waiter was so sweet.  We wanted to put him in our pocket and take him home.  Alas, we did not as we figured this might have creeped him out a bit. Anyhow, I'd give this place 10 stars if I could.  Everything is just so good.  They never balk at my ""um could you sub a salad for the potatoes"" (and this last time I had a lovely salad with green apples and shaved celery/fennel - yum!), the service is great, the waiters very personable, and obviously the owners know what they're doing.  :)  Bravo Big Jones, for coming through for us!!!",0.9932,0.799,0.179,0.022,0.4996913580246914
2009-11-23,4.0,"Delicious, delicious, delicious! We were headed for sushi in Andersonville, but in typical foodie fashion, we happened to read every menu on the windows as we walked by and this place managed to completely change our direction and draw us in. So here's what we ate: Fried green tomatoes with homemade remoulade and pickled shrimp, fresh cornbread with honey butter, pulled pork sandwich, and shrimp & cheese grits. Most everything was amazing, especially the cornbread  - hello, this is me, the girl who doesn't even LIKE cornbread, but this stuff was good.  It didn't have that faux-sweet flavor and let the honey butter take care of the sweetness as it melted into the piping hot disc-shaped hunks of bread.  Mmm.  The fried green tomatoes were also excellent to the point where I'd be hard pressed to come here and NOT eat them. The cocktails were of that interesting ""Violet Hour"" variety where it's not what you see on most menus, which in my mind is a plus.  I mostly drank sweet tea though, which is awesome stuff.  The one criticism is, unfortunately, the pulled pork.  It didn't really have that signature smoky flavor.  But everything else was spot-on. My advice is to go here when your stomach is growling and you absolutely need to eat becuase I left feeling HEAVY.  That was a lot of butter, fried stuff, and syrup (sweet tea).  Note that this is by no means a criticism of anything but my unpreparedness to go in and eat such rich stuff.

We started with the crab cakes for an appetizer and they were small yet wonderful, they had the perfect crunch. My husband had the shrimp and grits and I had the pork chop.

For drinks they had a nice tea selection and nicely presented, while I had the 'homemade' ginger beer, which was very tasty and refreshing.

2009-11-07,5.0,"What can I say? I haven't had a meal that was this good in a really long time. I was so happy with my food and service the first time on a Sunday, that I went back with a friend on Wednesday of the same week. I met up with a friend on Sunday to catch up on the past week. We decided to go here on a whim because our original place was closed. Thank God. I don't know if I ever would have gone here otherwise. I didn't even know about it! I feel like I've been missing out all this time. Anyway, when I saw that it was a cajun/creole place, I immediately had a taste for Jambalaya. We got there just before 3, which is when they usually switch from brunch to dinner on Sundays. However, Mark, one of the owners told me that they had a crazy brunch and were running a little behind. I asked if they had jambalaya and he said he would go back to the kitchen and see if they were ready to make it. He came back and told me no problem. I didn't see it on the brunch menu, but I figured it was on the dinner menu. Either way, it was delicious and Mark was so incredibly nice. Our server was a little flaky, but she was nice and let my friend and I catch up and we took our time with our Linner (lunch/dinner :P). I had my leftovers for lunch the next day and they were just as good. I told another friend about how good the jambalaya was, and she said she'd been wanting to check them out, so I figured, why not? When I got there, I looked at the menu for the jambalaya just to see how they described it, and it wasn't on the dinner menu either! I asked our server about it, and she said, ""Oh we always have a pot of jambalaya in the back"". I ordered something that wasn't even on the menu, and I had no idea! And they didn't say a thing to me about it. I felt so bad! Especially since they didn't make a big deal about me ordering it at all. That in itself is reason for me to go back.  But back to my Wednesday meal. They had daquiris on special for $5 each, and they had a ton of different flavors. I figured since I couldn't decide between two, I'd get both flavors. I went with the Key Lime first, and I was about half way through it, and I already felt drunk, so there was no way I'd be getting a second one. $5 for such a stiff drink?! I really can't say enough good things about this place. I ended up ordering the Reezy-Peezy, which I had no idea what it really was, but it was so different from anything I'd had, but it was so amazingly good. Oh yeah, and we had the crab cakes as an appetizer, and those were also so delicious. My friend got the shrimp and grits, and there were so many good flavors in her dish too. She got the Red Velvet Cake (which was baked to order) and I got the Mississippi Mud Pie. I really like to bake, so I'm generally disappointed with desserts at restaurants when they make something I know I could do just as well at home. Big Jones had not disappointed me all night, and did not do so with dessert either! The bartender (I think she was another owner or manager) came and talked to us and I told her how impressed I was with everything, including the jambalaya incident.  Bottom line, amazing food, and friendly staff that is attentive but leaves you alone?! I think Big Jones is one of my new all time favorite restaurants. It will be yours too when you go.

The cuisine is ""coastal southern"" which works out to lots of hearty southern fare with a more than your usual mix of seafood, crabcakes, etc. This isn't diner food -- while brunch is clearly a great idea, it's up a notch from the Golden Nugget. The food is, without question, among my favorites in Chicago. It's also locally and sustainably sourced, which is rad.  Things I like there: they do a biscuits and gravy that is so complicated you feel like that traditional white gravy was somehow cheating you. It's a redeye gravy over sweet potato biscuits, and comes with a big pile of southern greens and andoulle sausage. Mwah!  The Eggs New Orleans is also ridiculously good. Poached eggs over crab cakes over hash brown potatoes. So money.  There's other things to like about Big Jones -- wait staff is friendly and prompt, decor is interesting, drink list is complicated and good (a Bloody Mary is  thick with actual spices and veggies, not pulped mixer).

I reviewed Wishbone (aka the best place for Sunday brunch ever) yesterday; Big Jones has a similar feel to much of their menu, but it's just more upscale. And it is absolutely delicious! I went there for dinner two weeks ago; I started with an amazing spicy corn chowder. It was velvety, smooth and full of complex yet subtle flavors. It was better than the smell of dew drops on a honeysuckle blossom in the warm Savannah Sun. My entree was the Catfish Pecan, which was more victorious than the Union soldiers at Gettysburg! It was perfectly balanced between the flavor of the fish, the pecans and the mustard; it was a great savory and sweet combination. And please do not go here and simply order wine with your meal! You must order a specialty cocktail! I had the Carolina Julep, which is, ""Firefly Sweet Tea Infused Vodka, Lemon, Cane Syrup, Mint, Club Soda."" It is the amazingly refreshing and sweet and just perfect for sipping on as you watch the lazy Mississippi River drift by you. The enviroment is very relaxing, quiet and simple.

For appetizers we shared the pork, fried green tomatoes and the crab cake--all amazing. And for dinner my boyfriend got the fried chicken special and it was out of this world. Melted off the chicken practically and was perfectly seasoned. I had the catfish and grits and might consider getting it for a takeout dish in the future--totally scraped the plate clean.

We started with some cornbread that was hot from the oven with some melty butter.... then we had squash in a sauce that was to die for. It was almost ranch flavored but so much bolder. After that was a salad with plums and a plum dressing. I couldn't believe how good that was. So fresh! For the entree we had the Carolina wreck fish which the waitress said was bass. It was SO fantastic and meaty. It was almost like a steak. There were fingerling potatoes cooked perfectly... I ate everything on my plate. For dessert boyfriend had the Mississippi Mud Pie and I had the bread pudding. He actually said, ""This may be the best dessert I've ever had."" Wow! That's a compliment from him. My bread pudding was also ridiculously good. I ate until I couldn't stuff any more in my mouth :) It was awesome and all for $62 including our two specialty drinks.

2009-08-25,2.0,"After spending the previous week in New Orleans and thoroughly enjoying the Southern, Creole, and Cajun cuisine of the region, my cravings continued upon returning to Chicago. I could have died for some spicy Gumbo or Jambalaya or maybe a tasty, sugary sweet Beignet or slice of Red Velvet Cake...  I found Big Jones on Yelp, checked out the menu and was pretty intrigued. The other day I decided it was the day to fill my taste buds and stomach with some southern wonders. Upon walking into the restaurant, I really was struck by the design. It reminded me of the charming, old world Galatoires Restaurant in New Orleans, but mixed with a good dose of modern urban chic.  For 7pm on a Monday the restaurant seemed oddly dead, I believe there was one other table occupied. It would fill up a little more as the evening progressed, but still an underwhelming crowd.  Our waiter and the rest of the staff were extremely attentive and helpful, but something was amiss. The service seemed friendly, but still cold and uptight. I would have loved a little more relaxed and warm staff. The menu looked great - a ton of delicious looking choices. I asked the waiter what was the best entree the on the menu and he recommended the Country Friend Steak and the Gumbo. For appetizers we ended up ordering the Beet Salad and the Gumbo. The salad was very good. The Gumbo was good, but not great. I found that it was thin and seemed to resemble a spicy vegetable beef soup more than anything. They also brought out cornbread, which again was good, but nothing great. It was moist, but just bland.  For entrees we ordered the Country Friend Steak, which was good, but nothing special. I did find the deep friend mashed potatoes very interesting, though. We also ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich, which was good.  For dessert we had the Red Velvet Cake. It took about 25mins for the dessert to come out. We thought they just forgot about us - I mean how long does it take to get a slice of cake? What they didn't tell us was that it was made-on-order. Which is great, but we need to be informed of that. As for the cake itself: like all the dishes, it was good (a bit too dry), but nothing great. It did have a tasty sweet cream on top. Everything at Big Jones looked great: the restaurant itself, the menu, the actual presentation of the food... but the food itself was ultimately very underwhelming - seemed to have a lot of style, but little substance.",0.999,0.721,0.248,0.031,0.510983381025754
2009-08-23,4.0,"I'm from the South, so I guess that makes me a legit judge of sweet tea in the non-Southern parts of the country, right? And I do like the kind that they have at Big Jones. It's syrupy sweet, just the way we like it in the South. But it has a stronger hint of freshly brewed black tea that is often absent from the classic Southern variety. Served with lots of ice and free refills - perfection. The interior is very modern and well-lit and prices are reasonable. We went for brunch, and the server brought a little complementary plate of the tastiest freshly-fried beignets completely doused in powdered sugar. So good I wouldn't have minded just having coffee and beignets for brunch if that were an option... The brunch menu does not lack in choices, however, and it was difficult to make a decision. I ended up having the corn cakes with Creole-spiced ratatouille and poached eggs. It felt like a healthier alternative with the savory ratatouille full of veggies and the corn cakes bursting with crunchy whole fresh white corn kernels in each bite. The eggs were poached to perfection, runny yolks and all. It was a great, comforting brunch, and with so many menu items, I'll have to be back.",0.9905,0.799,0.19,0.011,0.47503105590062117
2009-08-23,4.0,"Have been to Big Jones twice now with hubby. Both times have been a hit.  Hubby is rather old school when it comes to his soul food, so this nouveau Southern cuisine is a bit over the top for him (braised rabbit and similar) so he sticks to the bbq sandwich or the chicken fried something.  Last night I had red wine and hubby had an Old Fashioned, and shared a Mint Julep. Hubby was skeptical of their ability to make a ""real"" Southern drink but he was quite impressed (I'm talking about the Mint Julep - perfectly muddled).  For an app we had  the beet salad and I would have licked  the plate had the place not been so full of other patrons.  For din din I had two apps - the sauteed mushrooms on grits and the smaller portion of the chicken and andouille sausage gumbo.  Hubby had the pulled pork sandwich with fries. I wanted okra, but hey...it was his meal.  Food quality was excellent. Even the fries were great and I'm not a fried potato person. The roux in my gumbo was wonderfully spiced and the sauteed mushrooms were wonderful.  Our waiter brought us the okra anyway ""to try"" (he heard me whining about it), with a side of green goddess dressing. It's sooo good. Just like mom's okra (if you have a southern mommy).  My only issue is the cornbread they bring out at the start of the meal. As with most midwestern restaurants that serve cornbread (unless it's really old school), is that ""cornbread"" it's more of a ""corn cupcake"". In my mind, there should be a crunchy snap to cornbread (hence, far more cornmeal than flour) and absolutely no sweetness to it. But to each his own. Hey, it comes with the meal gratis.  Otherwise, excellent food with lovely plate presentation.  Love the interior of this place. Seating is quite comfortable. Great vibe in the restaurant on the whole. Great restaurant.

The food was scrumptious. So, naturally, we expected roughly the same on our second visit. Both times we arrived right around 6 pm (mid-week), and were one of only two-three occupied tables, but this time we were greeted by an obviously ""new"" waitress (possibly new to waiting tables ANYWHERE?) that was so soft-spoken we struggled to hear her. Okay, that's cool... everyone has to start somewhere, right? The wait between courses was excessive for the number of tables occupied. Because the waitress from our first visit had given us a heads-up that the Red Velvet Cake takes quite a while to make, we ordered it before our entree arrived. Or so we thought. Turns out this waitress either didn't understand why we were ordering the cake ahead and didn't bother to ask anyone else about it; or she completely forgot about it. So when she came up after dinner and asked if we wanted to see a dessert menu, I reiterated that all we wanted was the piece of cake. She didn't mention not having ordered it -- until maybe 10 minutes or so later... and then she said it would be ""a few minutes yet."" After entertaining our 2-year-old son for another 15 minutes or so, still no word on the cake, so we finally just asked for our bill. I'm not entirely sure what the floor management was doing this entire time -- either they were not paying attention at all or they just didn't care. With 3 occupied tables in the restaurant, I'm not sure either option is at all acceptable. There was a guy with a chef's shirt on sitting at the bar this whole time, and I have to assume he could have done something if he cared... but he seemed to be more interested in sending the busboy to neighboring restaurants to spy on how many customers they had. The waitress muttered an apology a couple of times... but of course that didn't really help. It's a shame, because the food really is good... but I can't take the chance that we're going to go through this again. Good food can still cause indigestion when the experience is like this was.",0.9609,0.846,0.107,0.047,0.4823292448292449

2009-06-07,4.0,"I've been three times for brunch now, and 1 out of 3 it was amazing, the other two I was underwhelmed. But on a good day I'd say it is potentially one of the top places for brunch in Chicago.  The good trip: Saturday brunch, no wait. To start off, they give every table complimentary plates of beignets. I had the Eggs Romero ($13), which is organic grits, topped with [free range organic] pulled pork, two poached eggs (Amish farm eggs), onion chives, then sauced with a carolina style vinegar sauce. one of the best brunch items i've had in chicago. the grits were delicious and creamy and i ate every bit of them. the vinegar sauce went well with everything.. the onions were fresh and tasty, and to me made the dish complete. Everything on the plate went well together. SO had the Eggs Rochambeau ($14), Poached eggs, char-grilled Tallgrass sirloin, potato cakes, béarnaise sauce, and potatoes O'Brien. again it was very well prepared. the beef was top notch, actually tasted like beef should taste. their menu has 10 or 15 types of tea, i opted for tea instead of coffee.... service was attentive, prompt, with a great sense of timing. when our plates were cleared, we weren't rushed out with the handing over of the check, we sat and had another cup of tea/coffee. The bad trip: at 2pm on a quiet sunday, the food took unacceptably long to arrive (over 45 minutes).  the waitress knew it was a long time and offered us more beignets (which to me tasted like the grease needed changing) I had the shrimp and grits this time. the grits were nowhere near as good as the first time (too creamy?). the shrimp themselves were tiny, I was expecting 12-15/#count sized shrimp I guess. The sauce was nothing remarkable. for $14, it was a tad underwhelming. everyone else was pretty underwhelmed with their food choices too... one friend had a frittata thing, he said it was kind of bland. and he's from Alabama so he ordered a side of grits, which he didn't think were good. my other friend ordered a side of greens with his entree... when it came, there was a side of greens on the plate and a separate plate of the side he ordered... friend ordered OJ... she said ""i'm not sure if we still have any, but I'll check"" ... she came back with a half empty glass ""well this is the last of it"" ... we were charged $3 for it.  (update: i got a PM and this is how they serve their OJ to everyone) We were seated at the first table behind the register, every time someone came in the door a gust of wind blew directly towards our table.  I had to wear my coat. There are ways to mitigate the effects of wind when someone opens a door, they don't seem to be bothered by it. The coffee was good, but they don't offer real sugar, just watery simple syrup.  Not great for coffee. ...The third trip... Was bad.  The service was horrible.  Our waiter was obviously new (I hope?) and spent 15 minutes at a time behind the curtains poking at the register.  We sat and watched our food multiple times just sit on the counter for 5 and 10 minutes at a time.   We didn't get any beignets until we asked halfway through. They don't have a bartender, instead they make their servers pour the drinks.  I imagine this results in inconsistent drinks... My friend ordered a hurricane and it was gross.  He asked the waiter to fix it he replied ""oh do you want something not sugary?"" as if the issue was he ordered the wrong drink. SO's burger was overcooked. Friend ordered a small portion of gumbo to start. when we were ready for entrees, he decided he wanted a big portion as his entire meal instead. waiter said no as if it was a big deal to just bring out a bigger portion... so i took his small portion to make everyone happy. Rice in friend's gumbo was crackly bottom of the rice cooker inedible.  The waiter said it was supposed to be al dente... Mine was a bit al dente (but I liked), but his was just inedible.  Gumbo was great, fantastic even. SO told the chef how bad our server was and they comped our whole check.  So at least they have good customer service. For those complaining the prices are high... you really have to look at the quality of ingredients. Garbage in, garbage out holds a lot of truth in the food world. And I'll be the first to complain if a place is overpriced, but I really think their prices are justifiable based off of their ingredients (and they go out of their way to make it clear on the menu what is going in).  You can't complain that a $15 brunch item is too expensive if that plate contains a Tallgrass grass fed beef sirloin on it. Those things come at a price.  (though using high quality ingredients alone doesn't = great food obviously). If you want the cheapest cut of unnatural corn fed meat you can find, go pretty much anywhere else in Chicago and pay only a few bucks less a plate and enjoy all the high fructose corn syrup and corn fed crap you can find.",0.9912,0.827,0.112,0.061,0.5175950258891436

I am vegan and I cannot tell you how wonderful they have been and how many times they have gone out of their way to accommodate my diet. They have some great things on the menu that are vegan or can be altered to be vegan.  They have made me special dishes when I let them know I am coming in advance. Most notably, the chef made our table vegan snicker doodle cookies one night after having a nice three hour evening there. He came out to the table and explained to us that he realized he was out of soy flour and decided to make them out of pulverized almonds instead. I mean, really? That is amazing. And thoughtful. Warm vegan snicker doodle cookies made from fresh pulverized almonds on the fly?  Please patronize this restaurant. They deserve to stay around for years and years to come. You will not be disappointed. The menu is seasonal, the iced tea and cocktails are great, and in the summer they bring boiled peanuts to your table when you sit down.

2009-02-15,4.0,"As a native Southerner, I was skeptical about brunch at Big Jones.  My concern was the use of the terms ""low country"" and ""cajun/creole"" in the same sentence to describe the same place.  This may seem petty, but to me these two terms mean two completely different things.  When I hear ""Low country"" I think of the flavors & elements of coastal Carolina (mainly Charleston & surrounding areas).  ""Cajun"" & ""Creole"" mean for me New Orleans & the Mississippi Delta.  In my mind, the two together are too much; too broad of a reach.   Luckily, I was wrong.  We started brunch with fried green tomatoes.  Not normal brunch fare, but I couldn't pass up the chance to try.  The tomatoes were great - still a little firm.  The batter was perfect.  My wife had Eggs New Orleans.  The hollandaise was outta sight.  I ordered shrimp & grits.  The shrimp were cooked to perfection but the grits were the best.  Maybe it's just been too long since I've had grits, but I thought Big Jones' grits were right on with the perfect combination of ""gritty"" crunch and creaminess.   I skipped the brunch coffee & went straight to the sweet tea.  Mmmm!  Good enough to make this Southerner homesick. The service lacked a bit.  When it was time for the check our otherwise attentive waitress was no where to be found.  Nearby waitress chatter about other guests and the kitchen staff detracted from our overall dining experience.",0.9883,0.768,0.172,0.06,0.4863991960420533

To serve seafood that has been shipped frozen is a sin to call it a ""New Orleans"" dish. My girlfriend and I passed by Big Jones randomly this afternoon and decided to stop in for brunch.

Still not convinced though, I ordered a regular breakfast meal with nothing New Orleans in it. They make their own breakfast sausage and it was amazing! My girlfriend ordered the sweet potato biscuits with andoulle sausage and gravy. I tasted it and was shocked. It was dead on! The gravy was made with a base of onion, bell pepper and celery, the trilogy of all New Orleans dishes, and it was perfect! The sausage was perfect!

When something says that it comes with fries and okra I expected almost equal amounts of both. Not a hundred potato sticks and 6 delectable fried bits o' heaven. Alas, this was the case. Next time, I will order an entire side.  That being said, the BJ is pretty good in my humble Southern raised opinion.  Appetizers...The fried green tomatoes? TO.DIE.FOR. The only place in the city that I've found that they were actually ""green"" tomatoes, served with a remoulade which is just a fancy name there for spicy mayonnaise. The chedder herb croquettes? Ooey cheesy herby fried goodness, swimming in a pool of green goddess dressing. Are we sensing a theme here? Fried. It be good.  Dinner...I order the Baby Back Ribs. Not amazing, but not awful. I like my ribs wet, some like them dry. These were kinda in the middle, so that was weird. They probably could've been smoked longer because they weren't as fallin' off the bone as they should have been, but tenderness aside the flavor was okay. I won't go into another fried okra diatribe...you know how I feel about that already. Other courses ordered at my table were the Shrimp and Grits, the Pecan Catfish, and the Porterhouse. Ain't nothing wrong with a creamy cheesy bowl of grits, with or without the shrimp, and the catfish had a mustard sauce on it that I would be happy at any point in time to lick off any willing friend or stranger. My dad ate the porterhouse before I could get a taste; so my guess is that it was good.  Dessert: I'm biased here. I'm a pastry chef, and almost never order dessert because I'm always disappointed. Well, I'm going 50/50 on this one. The Apple Crumble Fruit Tart - skip it. I don't know why they didn't peel the apples beforehand, but it gave the tart a rubbery consistency. the brown sugar ice cream that they served with it was too frozen, super icey and over-churned. Not good. However...the Mississippi Mud Pie was awesome. Warm fudgy chocolaty heaven on a plate. With unsweetened whipped cream - which was fine because it didn't need any more suga'. Oh, and it was topped with toasted mini marshmallows. I love toasted mini marshmallows.  Overall, service was, well - odd.

The interior is laid out nicely and decorated quite tatstefully.  The service is friendly.  However, since there were only a few other occupied tables, I shouldn't have had to wait almost 10 minutes for a glass of wine.     For an appetizer, I was going to try the gumbo, but the waiter (a very personable guy, by the way) steered me away from it.  He told that it just wasn't that good lately.  So, I opted for the the crawfish fritters.  Interesting is the only way I can describe this dish.  The flavor was actually good, but the rice gave the whole thing a weird feel in my mouth.  I'm used to any kind of seafood cake/fritter made with bread crumbs, not rice.  I should have paid closer attention the the menu.  The order comes with 3 decent (not huge) fritters.  However, the chef is a bit stingy with the cayenne mayo, only squiting a thin, decorative squiggle on each one.  I had to ask for extra just to taste it.  My biggest complaint with the dish was the fact that it was lukewarm.  I know this is a southern restaurant, but geez.  Just reading the descriptions under the ""Hearty Entrees"" section of the menu gave me a tummy ache.   I opted for the pecan catfish, off the ""Light Entree"" section of the menu. The fish was lightly battered with cornmeal seasoned just right.  It was then fried and topped with a delicious sauce with pecans in it.  The mashed potatoes were bland and cold.  No seasoning to them at all.  Not even salt.  The organic greens consisted of one leaf of a par-boiled, cold, tough unknown green (I think it was a collard green).   The only thing warm in this dish was the fish, which I actually had to let cool down before I could eat it.   Between the appezitzer, entree and 2 glasses of wine, my tab came to $48.  A bit steep for what I thought was just mediocre food.  I did mention to my waiter that he should let the chef know that he's serving up cold food.  Since my fish was piping hot, I don't think it's a matter of the plates sitting, waiting to be picked up.   I can sum up my  visit in one word.  Overrated.  I don't think I'll be giving Big Jones another visit.   I work hard for my money and once a restuarant let's me down, it doesn't get another chance.    I can't justify another visit with the huge choices Chicago has to offer.",0.0672,0.88,0.056,0.064,0.6038593215063803
2008-11-05,2.0,"So my wife and I have eaten 3 times now and we both agree that there are some hits but quite a few misses.  The past two times we went for brunch and my wife had the crab cakes Benedict and I had the French toast with caramelized pecans, peach compote and maple syrup.  The flavors were spot on but the chef seems to have a problem with textures. The crab cakes were wet and the poached egg was runny. Combine that with hollandaise sauce the whole thing had such a bad texture, like saucy mush, but the flavors were great and the large lumps of crab were very nice. My French toast had a texture issue. They use a homemade bread that either was stale or not soaked in the egg mixture. I love fluffy French toast that has a pan fired exterior and a soft, fluffy interior.  The bread they used crumbled in my mouth and was dry or stale. The peach compote tasted like canned peaches fresh from the can, complete with the tinny taste, and the caramelized pecans were really hard. Like they make them way in advance and keep them in a container.  We love their coffee, and they have some truly fantastic items like a pulled pork served on a really delicious pan fried grit cake.  We will wait a while before we go back because Cheryl and I both moved from Birmingham 8 years ago and miss coastal food.  We want this place to be great because it's obvious the chef has a good palette, just needs to work through the recipes a bit more.",0.9939,0.732,0.205,0.063,0.4712301587301587
2008-11-02,3.0,"This place excels in inconsistency. The hubby and I love brunch, so we went here for his birthday breakfast last week. We ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes to start, which were fabulous, but we asked for them to be served with our meals, which they were not, which I could deal with if it weren't for what followed. I ordered the Creole Creme Cheese Omelet and he had the Big Jones Square Breakfast. It must have been birthday luck because his was a simple breakfast cooked to perfection. Mine, however, was not. The spices used in the omelet completely overtook the thing, but that still was not my problem. The omelet was so rubbery you could bounce it off the floor and I am entirely convinced this was due to the fact that it had been kept warm in the oven for eternity while waiting to be served. The cheese grits suffered the same rubbery fate. I just wish they would have been served when they were made so I could write an accurate review.  So, alas, my experience was not great but the hubby was perfectly pleased. We returned this weekend in need of a pick-me-up after a Halloween party. I thought I would give something simpler a go and got the Two-Egg Breakfast with Fried Green Tomatoes on the side. My poor tomatoes were burned to a crisp, but the rest was delish. The hubby repeated his breakfast, but found his sausage and bacon to both be way overcooked.   You might luck out and get the good stuff. Or you might not. Head here if you're a gambler. And just on a personal note, I enjoy my Southern food with a touch of love of comfy coziness. This place is not as fancy as it thinks it is. And with the crazy inconsistencies, it's way overpriced.

My side salad was good,  with a citrus-y balsamic dressing.  Sharon ordered a fish entree, which I forget, but she enjoyed it also.

After considering most of the specialties, I chose the Eggs New Orleans and it was possible the best breakfast choice I've made all year.  Perfectly poached, perfectly beautiful eggs sitting on top of savory crab cakes sitting on top of the most wonder popovers, all generously drizzled with a tangy hollandaise.  Clearly, I was looking for low fat options (um...no).

One of my dining compatriots made a meal of appetizers and sides, opting for the bean salad and pulled pork topped grit-cakes. The grit cakes were delicious, and judging from the fact that my pal polished off her bean salad with a satisfied smile, I gathered that was alright, too, The only blemish for the evening was my other friend's selection, the ham and cheese sandwich with a mac-and-cheese side. The ham was thick and tasty, but she didn't like the pimento cheese it was paired with at all. The mac was also pretty uninspired, though not actually bad. But perhaps in an era of mac that's been buttered, bechameled, truffled and smoked by every chef this side of the Mason Dixon, we expected too much.

I ordered the Carolina Shrimp Burger which had far fewer shrimp than I would have liked to have had; seemed to be too have to many components that for me got in the way of enjoying the Shrimp; the fries were good especially for dunken in the Cajun sauce.  Overall I thought the food was good but thought the service was challenged because there were not enough to service the brunch rush.  Our waiter was pleasant but was seemingly rushed;  I thought the price points a bit high.  The flavors were a nice coastal Cajun expression transplanted to this north Chicago neighborhood.",0.9916,0.766,0.2,0.034,0.6596296296296296

(I was spoiled by my sojourn in the South, and have found few places to enjoy ""real"" mac and cheese since moving to Chicago!) The restaurant itself was really lovely.  The simple decor evoked a sort of mint-julep-on-the-veranda kind of atmosphere (minus the pop art on one wall that seemed completely incongruent with the peach/mint color scheme).  The tables weren't packed in too tightly, and seating was friendly to people of all sizes.  The service was uniformly friendly and attentive, too. I started it off with a house made ginger beer....which was really great.  It walked the line between too spicy and just spicy enough, which I like in a ginger beer. I got the ham and cheese sandwich with some sort of shrimp spread, and paid an extra $2 for mac and cheese on the side.  The good news?  The sandwich was tasty, though I had to work for it.  The bad news?  The ham was *tough* (maybe a little overcooked?), and the bread could not handle its contents and immediately fell apart.  Also, the mac and cheese was....I don't even know how to properly describe how unlike any gourmet mac and cheese this was.  It wasn't even up to Kraft mac and cheese quality.  It was like boiled macaroni under some sort of bread crumb cover...I did not taste a lick of cheese.   We also ordered dessert - the red velvet cake (my favorite).  While it was not like the traditional red velvet cake that haunts my dreams...it was tasty.  The cake itself was lighter than I expected, and had a very light, citrusy flavor; the frosting was some sort of citrus cream cheese, and was the perfect complement.  Definitely thumbs up on dessert. Overall, I enjoyed the house-made soda, dessert, and the flavor of the sandwich (if they could just get the textures right, too!).  The mac and cheese - which ought to be compulsory for a Southern joint! - was just...sad.  That fact, the lack of vegetarian options (seriously, EVERYTHING was covered in ham or bacon), and the price tag, will probably keep me from going back to give Big Jones a second chance.  I might consider stopping in for coffee and dessert, but probably not.",0.9677,0.9,0.084,0.017,0.45440781440781447

Obviously, Big Jones has taken a lot of the criticism on this site to heart, because my second experience at this Southern Coastal Cuisine spot reversed all of my sad experiences with everything on the line: brunch with the IN LAWS! I've been meaning to go back and give Big Jones a second shot. I had hoped that the flops of my initial experience would just amount to kinks of a new establishment, I am thrilled to admit that they have been worked out! Sure, I was in for brunch, but what I experienced the second time around was an entirely perfect dining experience, full of exciting and unique menu options, perfect preparation and brilliant service! Beignets are as advertised: light, moist, buttery and sweet. Cocktails are refreshing and unique--a greyhound cooler was the perfect post-party remedy.  Sharers rejoice! A very diverse menu offers savory new-school takes on Southern Comfort food, incorporating spicy, buttery and fresh into every bite. It is only with friends that you can dig that fork into the many options that seemed to be prepared to perfection all around us. My Eggs Rochambeau were addicting and likely horrible for me. Sirloin slices were rare and juicy, sitting above some of the best potato pancakes I've ever had..better than my mom's latkes! The Tasso ham & cheese sandwich is delicious, perfectly crispy and rich. Those damned fried onions, potatoes and okra with a zippy cream dipping sauce are awesome! My mother-in-law's fried green tomato BLT was the perfect combination of tangy, salty, crispy and creamy. Seriously, I don't think I stopped eating, whether it be off of my own plate or someone else's. I trashed the grits in my last review. I loooooove grits. I am so excited at how nicely prepared the cheese grits were this time around. Perfect! Creamy, cheesy, buttery, damn! A little hot sauce on top and you have a knockout compliment, as if one was necessary. I'm such a pig, I ordered them as a side. I'm very glad I did. Service has a taken a huge leap forward. Our server was bubbly, gracious and happy to have us. Front staff were incredibly polite and offered happy waves to us on our way out. I would highly recommend Big Jones for brunch.

Big Jones is a nice brunch and dinner spot in the Andersonville neighborhood serving up Canjun/Creol food in a bright and airy space with lots of beautiful atmospheric touches.  Things that are always consistent, the few times I've been in the last month:  the coffee has always been spectacular, the beignets always warm, airy, and melty on the tongue, the staff always friendly and efficent.  There are some dishes on the menu that I find to be real winners.  Both my boyfriend and I loved the Carolina Pulled Pork Benedicts but thought the standard Benedict, was a little heavy on the ham and a bit dry. My ham and pimento cheese sandwich was a little overwhelming; the sandwich was so big that after a while the flavors were no longer appetizing a quarter through. (I boxed it up and too it home for left overs). I thought the Andouille & Sweet Potato Biscuits were a real standout; covered in holy trinity gravy (celery, onion, bell pepper) the savory and the mild sweetness came together very well.  I think it's a pretty credible attempt at Creole food and will certainly go back if only for the beignets, which my boyfriend can't get enough of and now asks if I can make every few days.

We had the ginger sweet tea; it seems expensive at $3.50, but the presentation and quantity more than make up for the perceived cost (heck, Starbucks charges more for coffee). It's served in a tall carafe with at least three glasses worth of tea, with the flavor syrup in a smaller carafe nested in the larger, so you can mix your own.

I got something with potatoes, rice, and a few other things in it that was decent(lol, certainly dunno why my memory of small details sucks from time to time). Also tried a few other things on the menu too, such as the Gumbo Ya-Ya, and the Tallgrass Beef Burger. Both were surprisingly good, especially the latter. In addition, I liked the fact that the server gave us complimentary boiled peanuts, okra, and 1-2 other vegetables on a dish while the wait for our food took slightly long, as I enjoyed those too. I will add that since I've tried more than enough Southern food in my lifetime to count(thanks to the fact both of my parents were born in the south, tho ironically hadn't had boiled peanuts till going here), I looked at the dessert menu, and thought it was very strange to me that their Red Velvet Cake is made with pomegranate syrup. Especially since all the times I've seen recipes for such, and/or have eaten one, that I've never once seen/eaten one made with that kinda syrup. Still in fairness to them, I'm glad the server I had told me that they serve beignets on weekends, and look forward to trying them on a future visit, if they're as good as what I've heard. Also will look forward to trying other things in the future, such as a drink off their tea menu.

Our waiter Andy was very attentive and spoke so clearly and so nice that I have to praise this place just for having him. He is a real professional. My friend ordered wine and I ordered a locally produced beer, when my beer came it was at room temperature and sadly not good enough to be consumed that way, but I pointed out and got a cold one in no time; again points for Andy.  We noticed that every table had a plate of peanuts and we wonder if we have to order them or if was complementary, in the latter case we felt left out as nobody brought us anything, even a neighboring table that was seated way after us got a plate. Andy again seen to had read our minds and discreetly said something to a busboy and suddenly we had one nice plate of boiled peanuts, never had them before and definitely can live without it, again points for Andy, not so good for the house. We decided to order the crawfish croquettes appetizer. They were bland and over fried, made with rice as a filler which is OK but the overall looks and taste did not amount to more than something made with leftovers and not even the sauce was unique or at the very least appealing. I have to tell you the house is still losing. I ordered the shrimp burger and my friend ordered the shrimp and oyster pilau. The burger was Ok but it tasted funny and when I said funny I mean cheap and not any better than the next greasy spoon burger. The pilau was definitely a complete let down, who thought of charging $18 for canned tomato soup mixed with a few sad shrimps and oysters accompanied by some unappealing rice; was definitely wrong. I don't mind spending money for good food but this was ridiculous, this was an awful dish for an outrageous price tag.  I have to say that that our choice of dessert was good, the bread pudding taste homemade but again not any better than that one you get at Country Buffet.

The a'plenty was tasty as promised, and the ginger sweet tea was great - the sweet ginger syrup was sitting in its own small flask perched on top of the sleek pitcher of tea below.  We had no room left for dessert, though on our way out we saw a slice of something amazing-looking that made us wish we'd saved some.",0.9847,0.791,0.197,0.012,0.5218954248366013

Great fried chicken!  However, our entrees were a let down.  I had the scallop special which was ok, my friends had the Etouffee and Sirloin Steak.  The etouffee was poorly seasoned and it tasted highly of burned roux, it even smelled burnt, we each had a taste of it and left it on the table.  The sirloin was super chewy, overcooked and also very bland.  We were hoping for better entrees after such good starters.   We decided to try the red velvet cake and were sorely disappointed.  The cakes texture was hard, like an overcooked biscuit. We almost needed a knife to cut it.

I asked what a ""Pilau"" was and the waiter said--""It just means Pilaf""...which I take to mean American fried rice or Rice-a-Roni.  What actually showed up was something more like shrimp and oyster (2--I counted) tomato soup with rice on the side.  It wasn't bad, it wasn't good--it was something I'd make at home if I were trying to figure out how to clean out my fridge and I had too many tomatoes, some shrimp, and some oysters. My friend had the Fried Green Tomato BLT which looked impressive, but she ended up eating around the bread which was kind of sweet and voluminous, so she basically ended up with bacon and fried green tomatoes for dinner. And they DO take your plates and silverware super quickly!  After all of this, we didn't have the nerve to try the red velvet cake--which looked the wrong color on the table next to ours anyway, so we decided to go down the street to ""Taste of Heaven"" and share a lovely piece of banana boston creme cake.

The pros is that the service was great, I enjoy boiled peanuts that are given to each table, and my food was yummy.  However... My boyfriend came up with the idea of plate size meal size.  We figure, the food should be almost as big as the plate. And then if you want to charge a lot of money, that's fine, but at least we know what we're in for. I got the bean salad with a side of coleslaw.  I didn't want anything too heavy, and I (gasp) don't eat seafood.  The salad was so tiny in the very middle of the plate and I ate it in no time at all.  It was $8, which is not cheap for a salad that would not even fill up a small bowl. My boyfriend got the jalapeno gator sausage, which was basically served like a hot dog, rolled up in bread.  It was good, but nothing to write home about.

So far, I have not experienced these insane lines/waits that everyone keeps talking about, but it's possible I am just lucking out with lunch hour as opposed to weekend brunch outings. But the place is pretty tiny, so I can see where you would have to wait on a weekend. M. Henry (down the street) was the same way until they were able to expand a few years after they opened.  The price for food is not ultra cheap, but the portions are more than enough to share, so it's a good way to cut the cost a bit.

It ended up being just fine but it was awkward).   With that being said -the food was delicious!  I  got so excited when they put boiled peanuts on the table to start instead of bread.  When I was visiting my fiance's family in the low country of South Carolina - they sold these at every corner and it was a nice little touch.  We tried the pulled pork on grit cakes, blue crab salad with johnny cakes and the barbequed shrimp for appetizers - all of which we left nothing on the plates.  I had the pork chop with this phenomenal relish concoction, cayenne mashed potatoes, and corn and jalepeno succotash and I can't say enough good things about it.  One of my friends had grilled soft shell crabs (instead of the traditional fried) and no one hesitated to help him finish.  We did think that the dry rub version of the baby ribs was far too on the dry side for our taste - but the bed of fried okra it came on was so delicious that it nearly made up for it.  The cafe au lait were served in HUGE mugs with simple syrup or some sort of naturally occuring from a root fat free sugar free version of the same (which I appreciated) and  the desserts were just as yummy.  We had read in previous reviews that the bread pudding was a must have - which it is - but that it was only big enough for one- they must have changed it since then because it was plenty to share.  I have already made a reservation to go back with all of my friends when my fiance can be there to enjoy some of his favorite foods with us.",0.9958,0.803,0.159,0.039,0.5389387798962267

When our 5th friend arrived (4 minutes later), he said ""oh yea, your party is here, just walk back until you find them"".   Our waters did not get refilled - even when asked for more water.  The food was mixed reviews by everyone - some liked it, some did not.  My one friend had been there before and ordered the same dish - the first time it was amazing, this time, it was flavorless and tasted bitter.  It was a vegetarian mushroom entree.  All in all, the host should lighten up a bit, they should direct bus boys (or someone) to fill water and maybe after being open awhile longer will be more consistent with the food.

I was sad that there were only three... until I took a bite. There was so much flavor in each bite, it was definitely worth the price. The accompanying spicy mayo was tasty. For the main course, I ordered the special- I have no idea what the name of it was, but it was THE BEST PORK CHOP I HAVE EVER HAD. The meat was succulent, and it was drizzled in savory sauce with perfect spiciness. The pork chop was served on some excellent cheese grits, with a wonderful spicy okra/ rice/bacon mix on the side.

Very attentive without crowding.  He kept up the great service, even bringing us new forks for each course, and keeping our tea filled.

The crawfish fritters were yummy, though.  Had a nice spicy kick to them and good chunks of crawfish.  Might have been nice to have a creamy sauce to balance the spice.  My friend had an omlette, which he said was good, but not great.  The coffee cups are huge and cafe au lait is a nice touch. They also have a good selection of hot teas of all different sorts -- black, white, red, etc. Our server was friendly and chatty, but not overly so.

2008-04-18,4.0,"We typically avoid restaurants that are at a minimum less than a month old.  However; having lived in Andersonville for 10 years you can get the food blahs from the neighborhood.  Needless to say when a new eatery opens up the neighborhood flocks to it.  Our original destination was to be Broadway Cellars but it was a little too chilly for the walk so Big Jones it was. We walked in at 7:30 and the host stand was empty...I was a little concerned because prior reviews stated an aloofness to people walking in.  The host quickly appeared and asked us how many and sat us immediately.  As others have stated we  too had many a hangover breakfasts at Augies so we were taking in the changes. The server promptly came to the table asked for a drink order and told us the specials which was a soup.  It did take us almost 10 minutes to receive our drinks which were a simple vodka cran and a beer.  Since my back was to the bar I could not see what was happening but my partner could see that the bartender was over whelmed.  I guess one of Big Jones specialties are drinks that need to be muddled...mojito, juleps not sure.  They may want to consider a barback/tender that is there to only service simple drinks so that the other can concentrate on the specialties or a manager could pop back there and help her get caught up.  Drinks came and we ordered the Pulled Pork Grit Cakes.  You get 3 which was a good size to split between 2.  I found it to be very tasty and the ingredients blended well with the sauce and slaw combination.  One thing that we both questioned was the menu stated they came on a crisp grit cake and the cake was not crisp what so ever.  I wasn't deterred by it but wondered if they were crispy at one point and then not?   I ordered the Tallgrass Burger and my partner had the Fried Green tomato BLT.  There seemed to be a concern by the manager that we had waited to long for our meal because he came up to us and apologized for the wait, shortly afterwards he appeared with our dinners.  I found my burger to be delicious as well as the mac and cheese side.  My partner was not too fond of his meal but I did eat some of it and did enjoy the BLT.  Had I tasted his first, I would have thrown one of those fried tomatoes on top of my burger. The Green Godess dipping sauce for the fried plenty was very good. We paid the bill and left.  We were told thank you for coming as we left by our server, the host and some other gentleman standing at the door.  It's nice when people recognize when leaving as I see more times the not it is a get out I have to turn the table. We will be back to Big Jones as we enjoyed ourselves.  It is maybe 3 weeks old so there are still some kinks to be worked out.  My recommendations are 1.  If you are going to have the bus person clean the table after appetizers you should have them replace important things like silverware prior to the next course.  The table next to us as well as us did have to ask for utensils.  2.  With the specialty drinks you may want to cut down the wait time with an extra pair of hands.  Other than that...great job and welcome to the neighborhood.

I've been waiting for something -- anything! -- to open here, so when I saw activity over the past month, I was excited. The sign on the wall indicated a web site for ""bigjoneschicago,"" which made me fear this was going to be a chain joint. Luckily, my fears were unfounded. The restaurant features ""Southern Coastal"" cuisine, which made as much sense to me as it does to you right now. I was thinking Carolina, but the menu posted in the window seemed more New Orleans. If you think ""hurricane alley,"" you've got the region just about right. Some Creole, some seafood, some fried green tomatoes. Whatever it is, it works. The decor was just what I needed on a chilly day in April. The room is wide open, with pastel walls (seafoam, salmon), bamboo flooring and accents, plantation-style chairs and paper lanterns. Very spring. Full length windows let the sunlight stream in, and curtains drape along the walls. I stopped in mid-afternoon, which is ""tea"" -- light plates, sandwiches, and desserts, and lots of tea. I had the tasso ham and cheese sandwich, which is served with a side of fries and fried onions and okra. I could have made a meal of the side. I skipped the tea and had the home brewed ginger beer, which was delicious. But more gingery than you may be used to. If it was later in the day, or if my schedule was free, I might have gone for a sazerac. Since I am a pig, I forced myself to have a piece of rum raisin bread pudding. I like my bread pudding with a bit more texture, but it was good. Jones also serves brunch from 11 to 2, and dinner starting at 5. I passed by the restaurant about noon on Sunday, and it was packed. Not a surprise on a weekend, but forewarned is forearmed. I looked at the dinner menu, and in addition to the standard gumbo and etouffee, there are some very intriguing choices. Jalapeno Gator Sausage. Fried Chicken Salad. Brunswick Stew made with rabbit, not the chicken which is often substituted. Tallgrass beef is served both as a steak (sirloin) and a burger. Which ties in with Big Jones' desire to serve local and organic ingredients. Other reviews have complained about the service, but I found everyone very welcoming, knowledgeable, and accommodating. Granted, this was a Monday afternoon, rather than a Saturday night. The restaurant is still a work in progress. Quite literally -- there was some construction going on while I was there. But I'm looking forward to having more meals here.",0.9786,0.889,0.082,0.029,0.41677435064935053
2008-04-13,3.0,"Well, we actually did eat here. Friday, relatively early in the evening. They put us as a couple in a back room that was dominated by a table of 8 or so people who were having a grand time. Their boisterousness was a somewhat good sign until we realized that they didn't even have their drinks yet. It was tough to hold a steady side conversation without being drowned out. Great space for a small semi-private party, but a bad one for multiple conversations. Regardless of atmosphere, we were enticed by the menu's Louisana style offerings. As such, one of us had the gumbo, the other got a shrimpburger. Both arrived in relatively short time, but were a bit bland. We were really hoping for some actual spice, but to no avail. Perhaps if we go back we could specify to increase the heat? The gumbo's presentation, consistency, and many of its flavors were there, but it really lacked any umph. The shrimpburger seemed to have not been seasoned at all. The waitstaff helped make up for the lacking food and atmosphere. Our waiter was attentive and considerate. We will try this place again if only because of that and a hope that the kitchen will up the heat (and flavor) quotient in the near future.",0.9415,0.844,0.118,0.039,0.4205128205128205
2008-04-13,5.0,"--------------- I have updated my previous YELP to reflect an experience, now that I actually was able to be seated and dine at Big Jones.  ---------------- I previously yelped about Big Jones, attempting to dine opening weekend. I must admit that I am beyond impressed with the owner/staff that went above (and COMPLETELY beyond) for me to give the restaurant another shot.  We ventured there this evening, after a movie, massage and a very relaxing Saturday in A'ville.  Our reservations was for 7:30, and we were seated just a minute or two after our reserved time. Our table was near the kitchen, but along the wall.  Service-  Our waiter was Andy (Andrew) and he was INCREDIBLE! If only all restaurants I travel to had someone with his charisma. If you sit in his section, you will understand what I am referring to. Instead of the ""yup"" , he uses actual English, and wonderful adjectives to describe the food, from memory. As Victor said, ""he is just fluid"" in everything he does. With all my travels, I eat on the road 45 weeks a year, from no start to 5 star restaurants, and Andy could easily fit into some of the best restaurants I have experienced in the continental US and overseas. Thank you ANDY!!! ( I could not return unless in his section) Our water glasses were never empty, and the chef/owner stopped by many, if not most the tables throughout the night. The place was exceptionally busy, but all went well.  Food---  Where to begin? The other half loves the culinary arts, and this restaurant had many items which left his mouth watering for more.  Appetizer-  Of course the boiled peanuts! YUMMY!  Soup of the Day- Was a roasted corn soup with pieces of ham. Honestly had to be one of the best, and most flavorful soups I have ever devoured. I have had many corn chowders, but this was robust in flavor, and the bread served was the perfect compliment to the palette.  Appetizer / Side -  Fried potatoes, Okra and Onions served with a ranch sauce with fresh herbs. The sauce accented the flavoring of the fried items.  Main Course-  I enjoyed the sirloin with the potato cake and green beans. The steak was a perfect Medium, and the tenderness as perfect for a sirloin. Understanding, sirloins are not a filet, and will have different taste/feel. The mushroom sauce went well with the meat, and overall, a wonderful entree.  Dessert- We were confident we were going to pass, UNTIL the mud pie passed by. We had seen the Red Velvet Cake, but the Mud Pie was heavenly.  It has an Oreo crust, chocolate cake (brownie like) with pecans inside the cake, covered with melted/roasted marshmallows. We shared one, but I could have enjoyed plate after plate.  Beverages-  The hurricane had a passion fruit base, with a bit of a fizzy pop to it. Not a typical Hurricane, having been in New Orleans 2 weeks ago, but unique and just as good. I liked the fizzy ending to it, and the rum selection complimented the entire beverage.  The Riesling was excellent with my steak. Not being a fan of reds (gives me a headache), Rieslings rank high up on my list. This did not let me down!  Feedback to other posts, since my first review of the restaurant-  - Yes, the restaurant is narrow, but uses the space very well. Compared to the new Frida restaurant that has half a kitchen table bolted to the wall, this restaurant was very fluid in design, decor, and style.  - With the wait staff directly behind us, never had any bump our table or either one of us, nor was anyone ""bending"" over as someone mentioned. Then again, I think ANY restaurant has people bending over, and that can be an unattractive view regardless the size of the restaurant.  - The lights were dimmed as the sun began to set, the music was brought up a bit, and the ambiance remained perfect. The place is very loud, and with a deep voice (yet incredible) server, that was the only challenge, but not a deal stopper by ANY means.  I am so glad I returned back to the restaurant and was able to finally experience what the buzz was all about. The soup, I could eat BOWLS of, and the dessert... well, enough said about that. I noticed that the servers were very attentive to the guests needs, and if they noticed you did not eat something, or had a problem, they worked quickly to make it right.  Thank You Paul/Mark for bringing Big Jones to A'Ville, a great addition to our community. It was great hearing how the recipes came about from days of the past, orchestrated perfectly.",0.9995,0.788,0.198,0.014,0.5303019136947708
