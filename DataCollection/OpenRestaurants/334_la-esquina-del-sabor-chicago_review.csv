2015-12-08,5.0,"Great and Excellent food! And so fresh. The Lechon frito y Morcilla are two of my favorite foods to get there, been eating there since I was a teenager. It's very good Puerto Rican food, good amount given for very reasonable prices. Try the food there you'll be happy you did and you'll go back for more. Being Puerto Rican myself when I say food is awesome it's awesome. We take great pride in our culture and our food is a huge part of it  YA TU SABE!",0.9915,0.631,0.369,0.0,0.7542857142857143

2011-01-06,5.0,"Talk about a GEM. My friend and I were driving through Humboldt Park just admiring the community, park, and people and we stumble across this food truck. Mind you I was considering eating at Whitey Castell's (White Castle) before we spotted this truck. I had to try it. Although it was freezing cold and there was about five people in line, I had to see what it was about. For $5 I left with three very tasty and filling greasy goodness that are pastelilllos (essentially empanadas that are huge filled with beef) and huge platanos maduros. ALL THIS FOR $5 we were able to be filled and have our taste buds satisfied. I definitely will recommend this to anyone wanting quick, but tasty Latin street food. Chicago is a city that has the Michelin-ranked restaurants such as Alinea and the best street food in the country, perhaps the world. La Esquina del Sabor adds to that panache. Definitely get the Pastelillos! They are so good!",0.9789,0.824,0.169,0.007,0.5458333333333334
2010-04-13,2.0,"Took a walk around Humboldt Park today and figured we would stop and pick up dinner from the trailer that always seems to have a line in front of it. The menu is all in Spanish with no english translation at all. The girlfriend and I speak a little bit of spanish but could not translate everything on the menu. We decided on a couple of ""mixtas"". I had the pork and the girlfriend had the chicken. The rice was tasty but the meat was pretty dry and bland. Most likely we should have been ordering something else but without any explanation we had no idea what to order. That's not their fault, but most likely I will not be back to give them another try.",0.4917,0.896,0.057,0.047,0.5294871794871795
2010-02-18,4.0,"So-I have been here 3 times and have never been disappointed. I love the rice, the carne frita is pretty darned good, alcapurrias are always fresh-although the last time they were out, the lady in front of me bought the last one, and they had just made 6.. and I was #3 in line. :( had a pastelillo, a papa frita and carne frita with arroz con gandules.  Was just there on a Sunday afternoon at 2pm and there was a line. Food was just being cranked out, but it was going to be 10 more minutes before they had more alcapurrias. But I digress (am a little bitter about that, can you tell?) Then today I went to Sabor latino on Kimball and Fullerton, and was so sad. Was not at all happy with the rice. I will go back again and again to the little trailer in the park!",-0.9238,0.852,0.038,0.111,0.5722222222222223
2009-10-30,3.0,"I've only tried two items here: the morcilla and the alcapurria. Both were excellent.  The morcilla has alot of spice and no intestinal flavor.  The alcapurria is soft with plenty of pork filling.  Its a good food cart  in the middle of the park, with alot of business.",0.6597,0.833,0.125,0.042,0.5900000000000001
2009-08-25,1.0,"""Errrhmmm... next time you're in the city, let me take you to something I know..."" -me telling a guest of mine who was trying Puerto Rican food for the first time I don't claim to be a Puerto Rican food expert, but I was highly disappointed with the food here after having tried some of the more local restaurants. 4 mini jibaritos - Meat was dry, the plantain was tough, pretty much everything a jibarito should not be.  Culprit?  Likely sitting under heat lamp too long and no longer fresh. Carnitas - Hit and miss.  Some pieces were phenomenal with the fat and meat a perfect combination of crisp, smooth, and tender.  Unfortunately, 3/4 of the pieces were too chewy, too fatty (fat was dried like eating cartilage that stuck to your teeth), or the meat was just dried out.  Culprit?  Likely again sitting under the heat lamp too long. Lechon - Soft and tender, the lechon was respectably decent.  Far from good, not horrendous. Yellow rice with pigeon peas - We pretty much filled up on this to fill ourselves.  Rice was fine.   Overall price?  Less tahn $20 for all the food... unfortunately even the frugal side of me has standards for what's enjoyable.   Verdict:  One star.  I'll never be back again. P.S.  I want to note that when I came to get food, it was the evening time (around 6 PM) so perhaps the quality of the food has continued to go down from during the day when the first prepare it... but regardless, there's no excuse for serving up poor quality food, even if your just a trailer set up.  From various other people's reviews, the food quality is likely better earlier in the day.  Unfortunately, I won't be going back to find out.",0.9572,0.77,0.14,0.09,0.5296497584541062
