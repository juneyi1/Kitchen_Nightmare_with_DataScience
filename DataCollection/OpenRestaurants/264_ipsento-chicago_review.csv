I had their Ipsento latte which featured cayenne, honey and coconut milk.  Spiced heaven (equally described as a hellacious brew)!  It may be out of the way, or maybe Ipsento is the center of the world and everything is judged as the distance from there. I guess it's clear.  I really enjoyed my first visit.",0.8685,0.864,0.136,0.0,0.37777777777777777
2017-08-24,5.0,"Recently attended a coffee class here and will be returning sometime soon.  The Cafe itself has a nice balance with a  bar area and small table up front with expanded seating a few stairs up in the back with tables and chairs. Could be served with a sofa or reading chair. Overall the interior has a great wooden design interlaced with some varied paint jobs and scattered art.  The main attraction of this spot, however, is the coffee itself. These folks really care about every step of the process, from their direct farm partnerships to their roastery down the street and brewing methods in house. They are committed to fair pay and conditions for people at every step of the process and transparent about what goes into it. I got to try a  few different pour overs and a seasonal cold Latte. All of which had strong yet balanced flavors that presented a solid buzz.  The particular class I attended, their ""coffee 101"" was originally a birthday gift I received from a friend. After finally clearing a Thursday night to attend I got to meet some classmates of varying familiarity and learn quite a bit alongside them (while enjoying some mini Donuts baked down the street) . The instructor does a fantastic job of disseminating a lot of fun facts along with history and key components of what goes into each cup. They covered country of origin, processing methods, roasting techniques, grinds, and brewing. Then it all finished with a demonstration and tasting of a few different roasts and approaches.  Whether you are stopping by for a quick cup or a whole class, this place is certainly worth checking out!",0.9906,0.832,0.158,0.01,0.4492831541218637

2017-07-15,5.0,"This is one of my favorite coffee shops in Chicago! I used to live a block away and came here several times a week, and now whenever I visit the city I make sure I stop by here. Their staff is genuinely kind and interested in getting to know customers. They can sometimes take a little longer to make their specialty drinks or breakfast croissant sandwiches, so just know that if the line is out the door and you're in a hurry, it may not be the best choice for you. They're also very good about always asking if conventional dairy milk is okay or if you prefer something else (which just allows me to proclaim my love for dairy each time). I often get their iced coffee (though sadly it's only available in the warmer summer months) and when I want something special I get the ipsento latte or one of their specialty lattes that seem to change about every month. They also have nitro coffee on tap, which I definitely recommend trying just as something new if you haven't had it before. It's served in a smaller cup but without ice (so the coffee content is probably just the same as an iced coffee if not more), and looks a bit like a draft beer. In my opinion it's smoother but a bit stronger than traditional iced coffee.  Their ipsento latte is SO SO GOOD and so unlike anything else I've had. It has honey, cayenne pepper, coconut milk, dairy milk, and espresso and you must persevere past whatever impulse you get after the first sip because it will grow on you. Definitely try this place out and treat yourself to an ipsento latte!  If you're on the 606 or closer to Wicker Park, check out their other location on Milwaukee just off the 606. I've also seen them selling coffee at the Wicker Park farmer's market, and if you're at this location on Western and walking back towards the blue line, you can see their shop/coffee lab where they come up with their newest concoctions!",0.9854,0.86,0.119,0.021,0.47535652087376223

The Ipsento (honey, cayenne, espresso, and coconut milk) was worth the wait.  Don't be fooled by the cayenne - the drink has a slight bite but the honey and coconut override that.  I tried this hot and iced, you can't go wrong with either one. I was intrigued by the Cardamom Rose latte, but I had a sip of my friend's and was glad I went with the Ipsento.  It was good but not as unique as I thought it would taste based on the name and ingredients. The drinks took a painstaking amount of time to prepare and reminded me of my first Intelligentsia experience in the Loop.  But if you have time, it's worth the wait. There are seats available if you walk up 4-5 steps.  There are no large areas to study, but a few nice benches, sofas, and a mishmosh of furniture.  The temperature in the front part of the shop was blazing hot while it was only in the 60s outside, but it was more comfortable in the seating area. Some of the patrons here aren't so friendly.  One girl working on her laptop barely noticed we were there, while a guy sitting on a bench interjected himself into our conversation more than once and was trying to start a fight about discriminiating against carnival workers.  I swear, some people are offended by everything...",0.9527,0.822,0.119,0.06,0.5595238095238095

Lol I know I'm asking for too much, but they really got everything else going on. For starters, the women that operate Ipsento are truly a pleasure. I mean honestly, I've probably been to every independently owned coffee establishment south of Fullerton to grand avenue and east of California all the way to the lake front and I have never seen such an awesome group of cheerful employees like this in my life. They all work seemlessly together, with the perfect amount of playfulness with each customer while still getting their assigned task accomplished. I love it. Super professional, yet approachable and efficient.  While most of my reviews tend to be service driven, with Ipsento I can comfortably say they exceed in both the product that they offer as well as experience. I frequent intelly for my morning cortado and scone, but definitely prefer Ipsento's cortado now. The espresso didn't have as much bite to it, which made it easier for me to drink at 8am and had the perfect milk to espresso ratio.  The space is well put together, not overwhelmingly recycled-chic like many other shops and they have a cute little back area for studying.

The people that work there are usually super friendly and fun. If you need to grab a coffee and a sandwich quickly, this won't be the place for you.

2016-07-07,3.0,"Any coffee shop that can serve up a delicious latte where cayenne pepper is a significant igredient gets a round of applause.  My hat's off to Ispento for coming up with an original idea that really does work, despite all of my doubts.  What am I talking about anyway?  Well, of course I'm taking about the appropriately names Ispento Latte which is made with coconut whole milk, honey and...cayenne?  Yes, cayenne pepper.  Ispento provides a new meaning to ""sweet and spicy"", and yes, it's weird but it's really very good once you can get past the oddity of this combination.  Granted, this gem of a latte is a little on the pricier side, but then again so are all the other offerings. I ordered a jalapeño and cheddar scone which I suspected to be around $2.50, but it was almost twice that much...and I'm still confused as to why, especially when the scone was almost as a dry as a piece of leather that's been laid out in the sun.  Even with the latte to wash it down, eating thar scone was a challenge.  Granted the flavor was alright, but overshadowed by it's unfortunate texture.  I would have been a little more upset with this, but because the cashier found out it was my first visit he put my order on the house.  I don't think this is to be expected for every first-timer, but this was definitely appreciated. For that and the generally welcoming attitude, the service at Ispento gets an A+, but they didn't exactly pass my test on the atmosphere.  It's not that I didn't adore how cute it was inside the cafe, but I couldn't get past the fact that I felt extremely over-crowded.  What had initally drawn me into Ispento was a work meeting, but it was nearly impossible for me to finding seating, much less find a seating near an outlet.  The majority of the seating is located in the backroom, but it's so conjested back there, and believe me - on those hotel Chicago days it feels like a sauna in there.   I did like Ispento and I would most likely come here again, but only for some coffee since their snacks- /pastries didn't astound me.  Yes, some of the sandwiches sounded very good, but a tiny bit pricey as well.  It also helps that Ispento is in a good location; speaking of which, there's parking in front of it (though I don't know if you have to pay), but there's free parking in the neighborhood to the right of the cafe.  I'm always looking out for that free parking!",0.9947,0.791,0.163,0.046,0.5842654435511578

I had an experience here where I ordered a clever, but the grinder broke shortly after I placed my order. It took roughly 30 minutes for my coffee to come out, but the staff was ridiculously nice and apologetic for the mishap. They eventually brought out a card for a complimentary drink for my next visit, and gave our group two lattes on the house. The staff here went above and beyond to satisfy the customers, and I am forever grateful for wonderful people in this world.

2015-11-16,3.0,"My third cafe in the most recent visit to Chicago was Ipsento. This place came highly reviewed and I was pretty happy with the quality. Ipsento is on a standard main-street like street with some nicer shops around but hardly the feeling of a gentrified neighborhood. The cafe was pretty small for how busy it was but ordering was quick and they had 5-7 people working @ once at 9AM on a Friday moving people through as fast as possible. I ordered a Chocolate Croissant, Espresso, Pour over Geisha cup and a Chai Latte w/ Almond milk and the total was around $17 which isn't bad considering I ordered for myself what usually 4 people would drink but that's the commitment I have to these reviews :) Ipsento roasts their beans a few blocks away so not on-site but close enough for this reviewer. Espresso: My Goodness, it was so amazing! Thick, fudge-like with a little bit of berry, tree bark and even some vanilla creeping in there. This would be a daily drink for me if I was just walking by on my way to work...a dangerously good espresso shot. I hope this wasn't some accident never to be repeated again. 10/10! It was served with a chocolate malt-ball and Pellegrino. Geisha Coffee via Clever Pour Over: Another example of a third wave cafe / roaster using half the beans needed to make a cup of coffee. I know Geisha coffee preparation tends to be a little weak compared to a blend but it basically tasted like black tea to me, thin, almost no lingering flavor at all except bitterness. Really disappointing for the price, 4/10. If anyone can clue me in on why cafes are making their coffee so sweet outside of the goal of providing ""nuance"" to the drinker of aspects of beans, I'd really like to know more. Pastries: GF and I split a chocolate croissant. Cold, not flaky or even buttery. Had a frozen and reheated quality to it and I didn't get clarification of where they source pastries but unfortunately it was not great. 4/10 Chai Tea Latte: I forgot to snag a sip but I was told it was really great and not too sweet. They're probably using unsweetened almost milk. Closing thoughts: I'd come here for the espresso only or perhaps buy their beans to brew @ home.",0.9892,0.77,0.156,0.074,0.558875968992248

I was impressed in a the-coffee-was-good-enough-and-it-looked-like-they-were-hard-core-enough sort of way. The only thing I tried was some delicious nitro cold brew. Five ounces of it. I was also impressed that they have such a small option, for people that don't want much to drink or don't want much caffeine. To my unrefined taste buds, cold brew usually just tastes mostly like cold brew. This stuff tasted a little different; a little smoother; a little more pleasurable.  I was unimpressed in a it-looks-like-they-just-threw-the-place-together sort of way. Or maybe they just kinda got an old house and turned it into a coffee shop. Some coffee shops have a sort of sickening daycare atmosphere; this was more of a scummy old house atmosphere. I definitely prefer scummy old house over daycare.

Even if it takes close to an hour for me to get to Bucktown, I decided ome Sunday afternoon to make the trek. It was worth it. When I arrived, there was a long line that reached the entrance. While I am no fan of lines, I understand good artisanal espresso drinks take time. I can wait.   I browsed the menu and was having a hard time deciding between the Nutella latte and the signature Ipsento latte. I decided on the latter because the combination of coconut milk, honey and cayenne seemed too good to pass up. The Nutella latte would have to wait another day. When it came time for me to order, the cashier/barrista at the front counter was friendly. Waiting, however, was a little uncomfortable. The wait area is a narrow space between the pickup counter and a cream/sugar station, as well as being the main route to a study room in the back. I kept getting bumped around and came close to making a staff member carrying dishes fall over. Awkward. I munched on a canele from Floriole to distract me while I waited for this critically-acclaimed latte. The moment of truth finally came and I grabbed my Ipsento latte and took my awkward Edgewater self out of there. I am clearly not hip enough for this area. But one sip of that latte made me forget it all. It was creamy, decadent, but not to sweet, and that cayenne kick provided a nice finish. This is definitely one of the best lattes in the city!

2015-09-15,3.0,"I've been wanting to try this place for quite some time and for some reason I thought that the coffee shop itself would be bigger. They have a little room in the back but not much other room to sit in the main room where you order. That was kinda a bummer since I was waiting for my coffee it would have been nice to have some more tables in the main area. It was a super hot day in Chicago so I definitely wanted to get one of their iced concoctions so I went with the much talked about Nutella iced drink. I asked for the small but they told me that the ice drinks come at a minimum of the 12oz portion. Also, not the end of the world. I asked for them not to make it overly sweet since I know nutella is very sweet on itself and I wanted a mix of coffee and something sweet so I was hoping they would make it quite to my liking. And they did. The drink was wonderful, super super tasty and I would definitely want it again. However, the price point for that tiny drink came to about $5 which may compete with Starbucks prices. So all in all, I thought the drink was very good and I would spend that much if I was having a coffee date or a meeting with a friend but the atmosphere itself has to be a little better and more upscale for me to spend that amount. It's a little rustic, barn like which is great for the look they were going for but the prices are a little over the top for me for the amounts that they serve. Plus, my drink wasn't filled to the top making it like closer to 10oz, also a little bummer. Overall super tasty drinks, nice staff, didn't love the atmosphere nor the price tag. But if you live in the area then I can see you coming a lot, but I wouldn't make the trip from the burbs since Starbucks is everywhere.",0.998,0.743,0.231,0.026,0.5535087719298246

I think it had a lot to do with my preconceived notions of what this coffee shop is. I thought it was like any other hipster coffee joint in Chicago: sure all the sour looking baristas can make a decent cappuccino, but the attitude and the price are never worth it. I was totally wrong about Ipsento! Sure, the baristas look like regular Intelligentsia-like coffee shop workers, but they actually smile! And they are totally patient and helpful and engaged with their customers! And they made artful and well crafted beverages.  I had a cappuccino, and the foam to espresso ratio was right on. My date had their Ipsento special: basically a latte but with cayenne pepper, honey, and coconut milk. I had a sip, and it was just the right amount of both sweet and spicy. We also tried their new nitro cold brewed coffee. I am not a huge fan of iced coffee, but this offering was very smooth and not bitter at all.

I immediately liked this place after walking in due to its hip ambiance and as soon as I took a look at the menu. There are a ton of awesome sandwiches named after authors! The English major in me totally geeked out. I knew I had to order the Jane Austen, which was a croissant breakfast sandwich with cream cheese, honey, and apple. It was. Absolute. Perfection. This is one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had! It wasn't even anything particularly complex; all the flavors just worked together really well. (And I promise it's not just my Pride and Prejudice nostalgia talking.) It was so filling that I managed to count it as my lunch, as well.  For my drink, after some hemming and hawing (the drink menu looks stellar, too, with plenty of appealing-sounding options), I decided on the signature Ipsento drink. GET THIS! If you're reading this review and you've never been to Ipsento, you absolutely must get this signature latte. The cayenne and honey just work so incredibly perfectly. To this day, the Ipsento was the best latte I've ever had. I'm not much of a ""coffee person"" and you can barely tell this baby is coffee. (But trust me, it has plenty of it, as my racing heart told me after I downed the whole thing in 20 minutes.) The flavors work perfectly. Don't be scared off from the cayenne. Trust me, the honey has the sweetness taken care of on this one! I enjoyed sitting at one of the many diverse tables in the back, filled with books on the bookshelf, framed pictures, candles, etc. It really felt like I was in someone's personal nook in their home.

I don't know how these flavors work so well together but they do. At first, you taste the coconut milk, which is creamy and sweet. Then the caynenne kicks in and gives it a spicy taste. Sounds weird, but somehow magical!!  I hgihly recommend it, you'll be thanking me.",0.6953,0.726,0.159,0.114,0.6569444444444444

We arrived there about thirty minutes before closing and converse with the barista a bit before making our trip back to dinner. The baristas here are super nice and knowledgeable in the art of coffee.  I try the ipsento coffee while my other friends got the nutella coffee and the espresso. Like any other store, the espresso came with a sweet biscuit and a glass of water so you can wash down your palate after. For the ipsento and nutella, the barista drew latte art on ours. If the place isn't busy, you can definitely request a specific image like a fern, leaf, or heart. Besides the front part of the store, there is a back part that is intimate and cozy. This area offers a homey aspect and you can read a book or study here since it is pretty quiet and there is free wifi. I will definitely come back!",0.985,0.82,0.18,0.0,0.4381944444444444

It has two floors and it's very cozy. They have nerds behind the counter that know what they're doing. Best coffee I've probably ever drink. If you're in the state of Illinois you need to drive all the way down to this place even if it takes you three hours. I rank them higher than intelligentsia. Also they have a new nitrate brew that they just came out with and still experimenting with it but it's only 1 in Chicago. Come check it out it out,0.8248,0.909,0.091,0.0,0.6244949494949494

HOWEVER, today I noticed my cup was smaller than the normal 12 oz small. It was almost like a Cortado size.  Did something change? Am I out of the loop since its been 3 months since my last Ipsento? For 8 bucks and change I would like a little more.  2nd HOWEVER, when the barista gave me my drink and I went through my mental shock at the size for what I spent , I still went off in my car and tried to take the puzzle off my face. Once I tried my Ipsento, it was BETTER than I remember, that it almost drove me to tears of joy and I was fist pumping in the air while driving.  Such a great finish in my mouth after my first sip. Its hard to explain how yummy this drink is as I am not a coffee tasting expert at all. PLUS THE O M G of that Almond Croissant. I was truly satisfied.  My lovely Ipsento had me charged  and nicely buzzed for the morning at work.  I viewed the menu via Yelp and noticed that now Ipsento has a small 8oz, Medium and a large.

The latte has a great creamy texture, the perfect amount of sweetness, and the cayenne pepper adds a nice little kick to it. I'm kicking myself for not getting a latte to go as well...

It's something that is sweet and sassy I think that it reminds me of ME.  This drink was fabulous.  If all coffee tasted like this I would be a converted coffee drinker.  Since I am normally a tea drinker in will have to go back to try their chai tea and of course the ipsento.  This place is worth a visit.

2014-11-23,4.0,"This is by far my favorite coffee shop in Chicago, and up there with some of the best coffee I've had anywhere- and this is coming from someone who lived in Seattle for a bit.  I LOVE the Ipsento latte, made with coconut milk, honey and cayenne pepper. Sounds strange, I know, but it is amazing. One of my favorite lattes anywhere. Not too sweet, not too spicy, just an awesome flavor.  My husband's favorite is the Nutella latte, which is also very good, but a bit rich for my taste personally.  I've tried their other special latte, the Cardamom Rose, but personally didn't love the flavor. A bit too much of a floral taste for me.  Their breakfast sandwiches are good but absolutely sinful. They are made with fresh croissants, baked in an oven with melted cheese. I've tried the tomato basil one, the salmon one & the goat cheese/ mushroom one, (I forget the names) and all delicious- though I feel guilty every time as they must be loaded with calories. I noticed today that they use a grain bread for their lunch sandwiches, so next time I may try to sub the bread to make it slightly more healthy.  We always get our coffee/ food to go, but there are a few tables if you want to dine in, and in the warmer months there is a small patio with some benches outside, if you want to sit and enjoy your coffee with your dog.  The only reason I give Ipsento 4 stars instead of 5 is the consistent long wait times. Like others have said, it doesn't  seem matter whether or not there is a long line or a short line, be prepared to wait 10+ minutes for your coffee and potentially longer if you ordered food. Its definitely worth the wait, but I don't love that you can't seem to get out of there quickly, even when there isn't a long line.",0.9957,0.728,0.212,0.06,0.571376306620209

2014-09-23,5.0,"After long-awaiting to try Ipsento, I finally had the chance!  I had read about Ipsento from many articles rating Chicago's best coffee shops and knew I had to come here.  It was an extremely tough decision on which latte to try.  I wanted to order both the Nutella and Ipsento lattes but decided not to be greedy *sigh* and chose the Ipsento.  It did not disappoint and was a delicious blend of flavors in my mouth.  This latte has coconut milk, honey, cayenne pepper, and your choice of milk (soy for me).  The coconut milk is fairly strong so if you aren't a fan of coconut, you may not fully enjoy this latte.  However, the coconut milk makes the latte smooth and VERY creamy since it has a higher fat content than other milks.  The addition of honey lends the latte a slight sweetness without being sickly sweet and the cayenne pepper adds an interesting warmth.  YUM. I also tried a sip of my sister's Nutella latte and it was superb as well.  Creamy, chocolate-y, and rich.  I can't say which one I prefer more since both were awesome in their own ways.  I highly recommend trying both at some point. I also had the chance to try their chocolate chip scone and boy was it good!  I am fairly picky about scones since some are too dry and crumbly for my liking.  I prefer mine with a slight crisp crust but a moist, flaky center.  Their scone was perfect and made even better since it had chocolate chunks rather than chips.   Ipsento is as good as everyone raves about and you should get your tuchas over here ASAP to try their coffee and baked goods.  If not, your loss!",0.9972,0.733,0.235,0.032,0.6045402298850575

I have tried: - the Ipsento Latte (hot): cayenne? oh yeah! - Cardamom Rose Latte (hot): delicious, but a little disappointing (I think I had unrealistic expectations going into it) - Chai (iced) - great for the summer and a great balance of sweet and spicy Prices: around $4 My favorite sandwich here is by far the Mark Twain (egg, tomato, basil, and cheese on a croissant), although I admit it's a bit salty.  The C.S. Lewis is good, too (and a little less salty).  Rewards program: They had punch cards at one time but I don't think they have them anymore (at least the last time I went they didn't). Wifi: Free. Be sure to ask for the password when you order -- just know that they're clever, meaning usually the reply you'll get to ""What's the wifi password?"" IS the password (gets me every time and I love it!).  Sitting/workspace situation: Ipsento is bigger than it looks; there is near-hidden room in the back up a couple stairs. It's usually busy so sometimes finding a place to set up camp is a little tricky but I've never not found a seat. Also, Ipsento does a ""Coffee 101"" class, which is GREAT! The class begins with coffee history (which was my favorite part, but I'm sure I'm in the minority on that one) then goes to demonstration/hands-on. Our class was tailored to our group's specific interests, which was nice because he focused on demonstrating home brewing methods that we suggested. I highly recommend checking this class out if you're even remotely interested in coffee.

2014-08-10,5.0,"This is an incredible coffee shop. As I pen this review, my mouth is watering thinking about their Ipsento drink. It's out of this world. They brew great coffee here, that's for sure. But what might be even better are their specialty drinks. I've had both the Nutella and the Ipsento. The Nutella was great, but the Ipsento is phenomenal. The best part is that the ingredients are ones you would not expect to taste great together, but they do. It's essentially a latte made with coconut milk, honey, and cayenne pepper. You can get a spicier version (with more cayenne) upon request. The result is insane. The atmosphere probably isn't the best out of all of the coffee shops I've been to, but it's not bad.

2014-05-08,1.0,"They have very good coffee and sandwiches, no doubt. The Ernest Hemingway is one of the better breakfast sandwiches around and Hipsento has, if you catch it at the right time and with the right employees working, okay service. Yet, if you catch this place with any sort of line, or with the wrong lineup of employees......yikes, yikes, yikes.  I get that this place is setting a hip vibe, and I get that the people working there and the customers conducting work there feel as much.  Hey, not going to lie, Bucktown is pretty hip (but lets not kid ourselves Chicago, you are not Oakland, Portland, Seattle, Milwaukee, Wellington, New Zealand, or even Charlotte for that matter; you need some diversity and at least an apparent sense of outrage that this city is so horribly segregated, or acknowledgement of the lunacy that this city makes one sacrifice being outdoors for 1/2 of the year for the sake of showing off one's hispter-fanhood when the sun finally comes out in May.  Chicago, you have a long way to go).  Being hip doesn't mean that customer service should move at the same pace of the hipsters cadence; or that the greetings from the kid working the register, with the ironic tattoo on the forearm visible, has to be rude when he doesn't understand the underground hip-hop shirt one is wearing.  This leads to said hipster cashier and barista deciphering that the said customer is hipper than he (note, being hipper than a hipster without such an intention is a recipe for an emotional hipster, and horrible service). Take precautions before visiting and ordering...... So I went there today because Hipsento is right down the street and I like to mix up the coffee spots I frequent in Bucktown before work.  The queue had 0 people in front of us, and just a handful of people waiting for their coffee and food.  I ordered the very good Ernest Hemingway and a coffee at 10:40.  By 11:08 my Hemingway was completed.  And just as Ernest Hemingway in real life was notorious in the monotony of repetition, Hipsento is now becoming notorious for the longest waiting time for a simple sandwich in Chicago. The Sun Also Rises, and I will move on and I think I will be ok.  As Nietzsche once philosophized, that what we find words for is something we already despise in our hearts, so in some ways there is always a sort of contempt in the act of speaking.  With that in mind, and as I was finally handed my Ernest Hemingway sandwich w/coffee in hand, and upon my exit of this establishment I threw up a ""hang-loose"" sign and let out an exhausted ""FFUUUU*****KKKK!"" just loud enough for it to upset the tension that had been created by the five employees working, scrambling at a hip pace to recreate the masterpiece of Hemingway, just as Hemingway had always struggled to best Joyce. I find the service here closer to Narcissus observing himself -granted only a few of the employees are guilty of this - checking the mirror at each step of the coffee making process, making sure their hair is just so and their accessories follow suit. Or, if you have an angry hipster, again, YIKES. Due to this -- and again, sorry Hipsento, but two or three players on a roster can ruin a team -- I have to give this place its proper placement.  I think next time I cruise over there I will down a bottle of cough syrup and but on some chopped and screwed music, that way the pace will be if nothing else ironic.",-0.954,0.876,0.047,0.077,0.597399951899952

But the goodness here at Ipsento doesn't stop there.  They also have their signature drink, the Ipsento, which is wife's favorite and delicious as well.  Their standard coffees are above average as well, but really you should consider one of their specialty coffees. The fun doesn't stop at the coffee, though.  I also recommend the macaroons right at the check out (the chocolate covered ones reign supreme) as well as the breakfast sandwiches, which are prepared to order.  I prefer the Mark Twain.

Hire some extra people on Saturdays for the rush, Ipsento, so I can fully overwhelm my senses as is only fitting of your fine establishment. I mean, the nutella latte alone is enough to make anyone enjoy their coffee drinking experience and transcend them into another sugary, caffeine-laden, hazelnutty world of awesomeness. So I guess what I'm saying is, try the nutella latte if you haven't already done so. If nutella/hazelnuts isn't your thing - SUCKS TO BE YOU!  Don't forget to check the back room for more space.

It is a true coffee experience. If you are a coffee drinker, then you owe it to yourself to drink what Ipsento is roasting and brewing. Word of caution, the best doesn't come cheap... Thank you so much for understanding that soy is not an acceptable, nor healthy alternative, to lactose products. They offer both coconut and almond milk. Warning: Ipsento's almond milk chai will ruin you for all others. Sigh. Same with their coffee products.  Do yourself a favor and order their signature drink, aptly named the Ipsento. It's a brilliant concoction of coconut milk, espresso, honey, cayenne and ""cut"" with the milk product of your choice. Go with almond. The coconut and almond blend wonderfully with the spice from the cayenne and the sweet from the honey. The cayenne will warm your throat much like a solid bourbon. If you're a bourbon drinker you know what I'm talking about. It's a beautiful thing.  I know they recently changed some things around, but the front is still incredibly awkward. The flow just doesn't work. The back room is funky. Again, not the most comfortable seating options (hard benches, etc), but the relaxed vibe makes up for it. I've been on a weekend and on a weekday - it's always busy.

Great parking, free, right outside on the street (luckily no snow) gave us a good headstart to our mood. At about $4 for a 12oz Ipsento signature drink, it was well worth it; my friends loved their choices of the mocha and the nutella (I liked the nutella too). If you have a sweet tooth, nutella is great; if you like a hint of pepper heat on your tongue, the Ipsento is great. All in all, the coffee was a different experience than most other places. The only thing I'd to complain about is that the baristas did not seem very friendly. I mentioned it was the first time we were there, and expected a bit of history or explanation of the layout of the cafe (which is cool, actually, almost like a tavern); however, I got none, nor any suggestions. My questions were answered curtly, leaving me with a feeling of unwelcome. However, while making the coffee, they were really professional and I liked that. Maybe it was just a very tiring and long day for them, so I'll try visiting again. Also, it is kind of small and most people with taken seats looked like they are there to stay more than a bit.. So if you're there as a group (2 or more) more on a evening, I think it might be difficult to find a spot to enjoy your coffee. We carried ours out and into Lazo's next door. So, 4 for the coffee; 4.5 for the decor; 3 for the experience. Oh, and did I mention that this coffee and a taco at lazos is enough to stuff you for dinner.

After slaying the Hydra, cleaning the Augean stables in a single day, obtaining the girdle of Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons etc. etc., who has time to truck all the way up to Mt.

And who has time to do it yourself in the morning while you are running around gathering your armor and swords before shipping out with Jason and the Argonauts for who knows how long until you find the golden fleece?  You know you are not a morning person. The last time your wife woke you up early without coffee - you ended up murdering your family. (Thank Zeus for the ancient work-release program for family murderers.)  Fortunately, Ipsento has your back.  The aforementioned Zeus himself, while taking a break from assuming human form to seduce hipster chicks in Bucktown, has been known to drop in on Ipsento unannounced and order a large ipsento with almond milk.  And why wouldn't he? The large ipsento rivals the gods' Ambrosia, a nectar that confers ageless immortality upon whoever consumes it. Plus unlike ambrosia, you can do it lactose-free by substituting soy or almond milk for a small up charge. Sure it's not cheap and pushes six bucks with the almond milk substitute.  But six bucks seems like a small price to pay to not murder your family and have a drink that confers ageless immortality. The Ipsento staff run a tighter ship than the aforementioned Argonauts.

The challenge was hard, but skipping my morning latte routine was even harder. Corporate morning zombies ain't cute.  See, I avoid soy milk like the plague. Based on some remedial internet knowledge, I'm just paranoid about its cancer and elevated estrogen related links, so with Starbucks and Caribou and all the major chains alike only opting for soy as their non-dairy offering, it usually leaves me totally in the dark - literally - if I'm skipping real milk. But not here! Not at Ipsento!  After hearing much griping from me re: missing coffee drinks, the lovely Erin P. asked me if I had tried Ipsento's coconut milk or almond milk based offerings yet. And I was all ""what the what, coconut milk lattes?!"" I think my smile shined brighter than uranium.  I hopped in the car, hightailed it to Western Ave (near Armitage... where the parking sucks, mind you), ran in like Prefontaine, and ordered up the finest non-dairy espresso concoction my lips have ever touched.

I will go completely out of my way in order to stop by and order a drink here instead of any number of closer places. The food, by the way, is also fantastic. I've ordered one or two sandwiches, and they were phenomenal. The Ernest Hemingway I vividly remember loving. That's right, the sandwiches are named after authors. Bonus points in my book.  The actual interior is great, too. Although there isn't a ton of space, they have a back room that's relatively quiet and great for studying and getting work done. If you happen to come on a day that they're roasting their coffee in house, feel blessed.  My church has also used their beans for a large event, and the coffee was amazing. I believe it's their Brazil roast I love; can't get enough of it. They were also super accommodating to our crazy large order.  In all these different areas, Ipsento hits five stars, across the board. My search for the best Chicago coffee shop has long been over.",0.9977,0.74,0.234,0.026,0.5665898617511521

2013-12-04,4.0,"I came and tried the two most popular drinks on the menu, the ipsento and Nutella latte. The ipsento sounds like it would be a weird combination, coconut milk with cayenne pepper but it was good. It smelled amazing because it had a strong coconut smell. The cayenne pepper was there but it's just a hint of it so it didn't overpower the drink. This drink had so many strong flavors mixed together but when you drink it, you can taste how well they complement each other. The Nutella latte lived up to the hype. It smelled so good and tasted amazing. I just wished the Nutella was mixed better. When I was almost finished, I noticed there was a lot of Nutella on the bottom of the cup. My gf swirled it around and it got mixed in but it was super sweet.  There is free street parking so I can study here without worrying about my meter running out. They have a coat rack by the door, which is really convenient. I like how they have a second floor away from the door and counter so I can study with less distraction.

A couple of things that in the early morning hours drive me to Ipsento over any other place: Hours - they are open earlier than any other place...I roll in around 6:20ish every day and I think they open at 6am = THANK YOU. Customer Service - even if their coffee wasnt as (or more) delicious as other places, I would come to Ipsento every time b/c the people there are so friendly.  Let me put it to you this way - at some coffee places around me, I feel like it's almost part of the experience to be treated as if my mere presence, much less my coffee order is annoying someone.  At one of the local places my husband often remarks that he's sure the manager hates having customers b/c it destroys the perfect hipster camaraderie of the staff (but, I digress).  I have some favorite guys at Ipsento and am always happy to see them in the AM.  I want them to be my best friends and come to my house and watch TV with me b/c I am sure they would be fun.  And, as aside, they all wear vests on Fridays.  Come on now! Coffee - their coffee is absolutely delicious.  Even the standard cup of coffee is delicious.  The lattes are generally punch someone in the face good.  They roast on site and in plain sight - which is so fascinating.  There's a quiet guy that's always observing, caretaking the beans, making sweet roasting love to them.  He's likely the mad scientist behind Ipsento's deliciousness. Reward card - yes, this is just basic common sense, yet easily overlooked.  In a neighborhood with this much caffeine competition, you reward your loyal return customers...and they do happily. Food stuff - their sammies are really delish, made in house, and fresh.  Doughnuts are definitely solid - and the almond croissant - YUM.

Here's what will keep me from coming to Ipsento as frequently as I'd like: The location - Not too far from the Western blue line, but if you've got a computer and heavy bags it feels like a bit of a trek. If you're driving, good luck finding a spot on Western, a lot of the neighborhood parking is permit only, and the one way streets are infuriatingly inconvenient. You cannot park close to the cafe. The space - I have been fortunate to find seating at a table every time I have come here. The front room seats around 10 people, the back room seats maybe another 12 or so.

This drink has a solid KICK to it so if you like a strong taste of cayenne and almonds then this is the drink for you. I don't so I ended up tossing it (sorry you yelp fans) and tried the nutella instead. $8 later I was further disappointed by my second attempt. It tasted like almond milk with a modest and disappointing hint of nutella. This time I had to complain. I really wanted to enjoy SOMETHING from this acclaimed coffee shop. After some back and forth chatter with a hesitant barista (even though I already spent over $8 on disappointments) she finally offered to comp me a chai latte with almond milk... the first 3 sips were nice. The fourth however...nothing but almond milk. Sigh* So I tried and simply cannot understand what it is people are ranting and raving about here. I also didn't love the seating arrangements of this spot. I felt like no matter where you sat people could see your business (aside from a couple of spots in lounge chairs that were all taken) Very crowded spot...hence it's popularity (mystery to me).  I thought the staff could have been friendlier but they were decent and kind of tried to please me.

2012-12-02,5.0,"Since finding out this past June that we have a baby on the way, I cut my caffeine intake down. Way, way, WAY down. From a girl who routinely thrived on a venti/large/effing BIG AS HECK, YO cappuccino a day, it was a bit of a shock to my system. I still go mostly caff free, but now that I'm rocking out the home stretch (roughly ten weeks until baby girl arrives), I had to try Ipsento. It just...couldn't wait. I had to try it. Had to. Wanna know WHY I *had* to try Ipsento? Two words: Nutella Latte. Listen, I don't eff around with my drinks. I'm a straight up soy cappuccino kinda girl, but once in awhile a ""fluffy"" drink captivates my attention. And let's just call a spade a spade, shall we? The word ""Nutella"" in anything leads me to believe it will probably be a big ""mouth 'O'"", if you will. So when I read the words ""Nutella"" and ""latte"" together, I had to give it a whirl.  My husband and I embarked upon the greatness we were hoping to find at Ipsento. By the five stars you're seeing above this review, I'm guessing you're probably able to ascertain exactly what we thought of said ""Nutella Latte"", no? oh.my .Flippin'.Goodness. Um, yeah. You like Nutella? You probably need to be here, like, now. If they're closed, just wait outside. In whatever elements (blinding heat, relentless hail, whatever), really. Even overnight if you must. No, seriously. It is THAT good. My husband is a straight up coffee drinker. No espresso beverages, etc. Just coffee with a little cream and a little sugar. He vacuumed down his drink like a twenty year old at a kegger and before he even finished, he was planning our next Ipsento outing. Oh, and of note? He's not obsessed with Nutella. I mean, he digs it, but I love that ish with an almost freakish intensity.  That said... My personal impression of said Nutella Latte? Perfection. Not too Nutella-y (I'm not even sure if such a thing exists, but if you're worried you'll be overpowered, fear not :), and the texture was creamy deliciousness in a cup. It was rich, but not in a Paula-Deen-This-Recipe-Has-Eight-Sticks-Of-Butter-And-Now-I-Feel-Sick way, more like a,smooth-like-drinking-liquid-silk kind of way. It was the perfect temperature. Hot, but not so hot that I had to wait-ninety-minutes-only-to-have-that-first-sip-burn-my-tongue-off-anyway kind of hot. (Man, I just used a lot of dashes in that paragraph. Fear not, they were all entirely necessary.)  In short, it was heaven in a cup. The coffee art was lovely and the staff was warm and friendly. Also? Our friend Ips earned a megaload of bonus points simply due to the fiftteen minute ""standing"" parking spots out front. No meters, no parking police, nothing. Just drive on up, run in for your liquid lovin', and depart. This alone makes it worth the trek to Ipsento.  In short, if you can hang with Nutella, you need to get up on this. And savor every beautiful, delicious drop. And the rich, creamy, velvety texture. Oh, and bring one back for me, please. :)",0.9975,0.739,0.19,0.071,0.5165331196581199

Unfortunately for Ipsento, I don't drink coffee.  However, I am a huge fan of fun, local establishments and made it a point to visit here on more than one occasion. I used to glance through the window on walks (in a totally non-creepy way) and see a living room-like space that looked wonderfully relaxing. Since then, I've been back on multiple occasions for a quick breakfast or to grab coffee with one of my actual coffee drinking friends.  The first thing to note is that it's not a Starbucks. The quality of coffee (from what I could tell) seemed well above what you would get from a popular chain and (bonus points!) they draw designs on the foam. I know, it's the little things for me. The breakfast sandwiches are pretty unique, but the past few times I've gone they have taken FOREVER to get made.

I appreciate a staff of barista's that understand the artistry of pulling an espresso shot. When it's busy things move slowly, and in coffee that's a good thing because you know they're taking the same amount of time and care on your drink as they are the first customer of the day, and a good espresso drink takes time. Milk and foam in their lattes are always a perfect consistency. I wish there was more seating, everytime I've gone in there hasn't been a place for me to sit and stay, but I love the interior vibe. If I worked from home or was a student, this would be the place I'd chose to set up base.  I actually live much closer to Bucktown beanery, but I'll walk the extra 1/2 mile to ipsento. Coffee is never stale, employees are never rude, and barista's know what they are doing.  My only complaint, and it's minor, is that they do not make their own Chai. I lamment the fact that I can't find more than 1 or 2 places in the city that actually make real chai tea for their lattes. But they have a leg up because they don't use a syrup, just a powder and overall it tastes good. Syrupy Chai's are the worst. I like my chai's spicy, not like a dessert drink.

I felt as though I may be able get a caffeine buzz simply by standing there and inhaling.    A quick scan of the menu left me with two lattes I knew I must try - the 'Nutella Mocha' (because, well, Nutella ANYTHING would have my attention), and the 'Cardamom Rose.' I wanted desperately to want the 'Ipsento,' but with Cayenne listed as an ingredient - I knew it was for the more adventurous (translation: not me) and had to pass.

Seriously, ALL I wanted when I lived there was an awesome indie coffee shop, and there was none nearby, save for a Starbucks near my Logan Square pad.  Well, I heard about Ipsento some time ago, maybe a year ago, and book marked it...and never made it over. Till today. It is a really cute place, and the service was friendly and helpful. I ordered nutella coffee, which is a latte with actual nutella in it. Yummy & not too sweet. I also ordered the gingerbread rooibos latte for my husband, who is giving up caffeine for health reasons. His long-standing addiction to chai lattes had been unsated all week, and he was cranky as a hungry woman. I brought this tea latte home and he LOVED it and said he would get it again any time. I grabbed an Emily Disckonson sandwich, and it was really very good. I liked that they gave you a choice including healthy sides (chips, carrots, or apples). What's more? They carry one of my most favorite things-- chobani yogurt.  The only downside is that I live in LIncoln Square, which is SO FAR AWAY. Okay, so it's not actually far, but it's off the beaten path for me to get a daily coffee there. How about a second location? At, say, Rockwell & Lawrence?

They deserve it.  So it's time I give this place the nod for doing everything about a coffee shop right.  Every day I come here, I get a black coffee. They tell me the kind of coffee, just in case I wanted to know--I don't really care because I don't have the memory capacity to become an aficionado, and I know that no matter what kind it is, if it's coming fresh from Ipsento, it's going to be the best--I take it to work with me and sip it so slowly that some of it is still there after lunch.  Then I'll drink it lukewarm. And it will still be good.  That's how good this coffee is. The Ipsento, The Drink, is like a warm embrace from a strong man.  I'm not trying to be poetic, that is honestly the best description I can give you.  The answer is yes; yes you want it sassy.

I know that this small coffee shop probably cares about the reviews on Yelp, unlike the cookie cutter Starbucks chains, which are all a bit to pretentious to me. I will say the following about this place: Atmosphere-I would give it a nine! I, personally, am not a hipster, but I don't judge someone on their looks. I do, however find it hard to swallow that the ""artsy"" type can afford a Mac and I can't, lol. It's all good, and that's not the reason it's not a ten. It's not a ten because they don't do any ""artsy"" stuff, like open mic night in their spacious back room. That would really bring in a nice sight not only to Ipsento but the community!  Product-WOW! Like I said, the Ipsento was AMAZING, as the reviews provide. I was a bit apprehensive trying it, after being so content with their freshly roasted coffee-really, they have a roaster staring you in the face, blending in with tables, and suitable decor! The cayenne really makes it unique. I have even tried the food there, which I never do, and found it depressing that so many raunchy Mexican joints and hot dog stands surround such a beacon in the night! Nothing I have had from here has been less than exceptional! Price-Well, an 8. For a boutique coffee shop, I do expect a higher price, but not as high as Intelligentia (sp?-like I care). I hate to give an eight, and by eight, I might mean 9, yea, a 9...the prices are fair I suppose!  Extra's-10-they offer ample amount of extra's, including staff picks playing on an iPod, to ALWAYS great staff!

2010-10-23,5.0,"My review is a response to this review by Dan S.:  yelp.com/biz/ipsento-chi… That previous review is completely false and unreasonable. Ipsento is a great coffee shop, not a diner. As a bonus, they also have a menu of about 10 delicious sandwiches. They DO NOT HAVE A KITCHEN so you really can't expect a more extensive food menu than that.  Regarding the sandwiches; I crave them when I'm not eating them. My favorite, the Jane Austen is a croissant with cream cheese, apples, and honey. Regarding the coffee, every time I've been there the coffee has been truly exceptional. First time visitors should try their signature drink, the Ipsento. It is espresso with coconut milk, sweetened with honey, and optionally made sassy with cayenne. It's a brilliant combination. I buy coffee beans from ipsento, and my coffee is never as good when I make them at home. The baristas know what their doing. If you can't stand to wait more than a few minutes to get coffee you should just go down the street to McDonald's. Regarding the service, I'm no more a fan of snobby baristas than the next person, but that is not how I would describe the staff at Ipsento. In fact, I have been there many times and never had a bad experience. Come on, Dan S., the secret to getting good service from anyone is to be a decent and polite customer. It's a two-way road. Now the real reason why I am responding to Dan S. Here's what he had to say, ""I don't have a profound reason why, but the fact that they're over 30 and work at a coffee shop should say something about where their work ethic has got them to this point."" You don't have a profound reason, because there is no reason. The unemployment rate in Chicago is currently hovering around 10% and obviously we are in the worst economic situation since the Great Depression. In times like this, work ethic is irrelevant when considering why someone does or does not work and where they work.",-0.4492,0.851,0.072,0.077,0.5856630824372759

2010-09-11,4.0,"My favorite part of Ipsento is the Clever Coffee.  Not to be confused with the Clover, which is that truly wonderful but insanely expensive apparatus at places like Zaleski and Horvath and Intelligentsia.   But the Clever coffee dripper has an important upside that can't be said for a french press or even the mighty Clover - it uses a paper filter.  Paper filters are important for regular coffee drinkers - they remove cholesterol raising agents like cafestol and kahweol, which are present in high doses in espresso and french press coffee and boiled coffees like Turkish coffee.  It's not a huge deal if coffee is an occasional treat, but for those of us that drink coffee everyday, the effects of unfiltered coffee can be significant.   Yet the Clever apparatus has an advantage over a regular coffee machine with a paper filter - you can control infusion and steeping time.  Which enables a barista to make wonderfully customizable coffee, cup by cup, without the sediment of french press coffee.   I tried the Clever apparatus myself, at home.  It's cheap, and pretty awesome, but I assure you that it's a pain in the ass.  You have to put the filter in, then rinse with warm water to get rid of the paper taste and warm the Clever.  Then, before it cools down too much, you have to place freshly ground coffee in the filter - a grind that's too coarse will require a steeping time that's too long and will cause the coffee to get bitter. A grind that's too fine with cause the water to pool.  Steep, and then stir after a minute and a half (the coffee enthusiasts online said a minute and a half - I waited two minutes and fucked up my coffee) and then cover again and wait, this time for a undefined amount of time that you can figure out only from experimentation with your own taste, and then. . . . Fuck it.  Ipsento is a four minute walk from my house.  And while my own dalliance with the Clever Coffee Drip resulted in perhaps a 70% success rate of a good cup of coffee,  so far they're still at 100%.   My second favorite part is staring at their sandwich menu and trying to make imaginary connections from each sandwich's ingredients to its namesake, which is a famous author.   Why does the sandwich with apple in it have to be named Jane Austen?  Seems sorta sexist.  The Henry David Thoreau has mushrooms in it - surely mushrooms are unequivocally Jane Austen, right?  Because of her time period and her writing style.  But then what does Thoreau get?  What ingredients could possibly convey both naturalism and anarchy?  And the Ernest Hemingway - smoked salmon is perfect for him, so they got that right.  But does he really belong on something as frou frou as a croissant? But of course it's all random, and even if it weren't, I can't come up with a menu that's both critically accurate and delicious.  It's difficult for the eclecticism of food to represent narrative history.   Maybe it's because I'm American, and have the inherent bias that there *is* a singular literary narrative.  Such is life.",0.9974,0.764,0.182,0.055,0.6032768620268621

We stopped in for a quick beverage and wifi while on the go. I got a small chai, which was one of the better versions of a chai latte that I've had in the Windy C -- not overly sweet, but not bitter. The staff and patrons alike were pretty nice and laid back.  The place is obviously popular -- the back room had tons of people camping out and we had to perch on some awkward chairs, but still -- I didn't mind.  The place s crowded it seems specifically because they are doing things right! Interesting artist prints (though I couldn't tell -- are they just digital?), and overall good music, too.

The spaces (one on the main level and one in the back and up a few steps) are small, but in a charming European kind of way. If you're lucky, you can grab one of the couple tables outside too! The food is phenomenal. All the sandwiches are cleverly named after classic poets/authors/philosophers that would be the coffee shop kind if they were still around today. (As a side note, I generally don't like my food to have weird or silly names b/c ordering them makes you feel like an idiot, but I found these to be rather pleasant.)

2010-05-25,5.0,"I think I've found my new home. Since arriving in Chicago, it has been my mission to find a place with an iced white mocha to die for. I'm not by any means a coffee connoisseur; I prefer specialty drinks loaded with sugary syrups and chocolate to anything else. So, when I go to a cafe and find that they don't make these drinks because, ""Eek, they're not sophisticated enough to be listed with their fine roasted beans"", I leave feeling like my $5-a-day-every-day addiction is not enough for them to consider slumming down their menu. Well, Ipsento isn't slumming it by any means, BUT they do offer a drink that may have just filled my lacking iced white mocha's place.  I decided to order their Ipsento latte. As others have said before, it's a latte made with coconut milk and honey and, if you want, a dash of chili powder. I got mine iced and with the chili. Hell, why not give it a-go, right? I also ordered their almond croissant and made my way to the back room. I sat down and looked around, and took my first sip. Creamy and spicy, taste buds totally confused. I took another sip, creamy, spicy and now sweeter; I take a third sip and now my taste buds are on board. Beautiful. I can't think of any other word to describe it. Heavenly maybe? Oh, and the almond croissant? YUM. Diet, screw you! I'm not going to apologize for eating it and loving every second.  The staff, mainly the very pretty strawberry blonde, was a total doll. She told me there was a back room if I didn't want to sit in the front and then welcomed me after I told her that it was my first time there. Most places (*cough, cough* Intelligentsia) don't seem to care enough to talk to their customers let alone welcome them. Ipsento, welcome to my wallet. I will be back, and back, and back again.

I am no coffee connoisseur... but my drink was good. And my fancy mini-chocolate bar was also good and not too expensive for what it was.

The space is small, and awkwardly broken up, which makes feeling ""relaxed"" and wanting to stay a while hard for me. Even a few people in Ipsento feels like a crowd.  Also, I feel like their tea selection is limited and the staff isn't really knowledgeable about it. Last time I was in I asked what the iced teas of the day were and was told, ""A black and an herbal,"" as if this was obvious. Yes, sir, your sign states as much. What kind of tea are you brewing, though? You see, there is no such thing as ""herbal"" tea. Herbal is a category, not a type. It was, in fact, mint. But somehow they didn't want to disclose this fact. Perhaps it's their secret blend of mints and they don't want to share. Regardless, they have things that cater to the coffee crowd, but between their lack of tea knowledge and their slightly bizarre location, I just never feel inclined to go in. Tea Essence is three blocks away and has about 80 teas for me to try. I have maybe 70 left to go through.

2010-04-16,5.0,"I don't see how anyone can not love this place. Situated on a homey stretch of Western, Ipsento is everything that's great about a (the) local coffee shop. Great product - The signature drink is every bit as strong as Naomi''s signature walk (and I wonder why I am single). Coconut milk, honey, chili (for kick and a little heat). Coffee. Duh. This is inventiveness. This is delicious. This is why supporting your local coffee shop is so vitally important. Drinks like this say ""Chicago,"" ""study break,"" ""all-nighter,"" ""first date,"" ""break up"" and anything else one goes to the coffee shop for. But, don't just settle for the Ipsento. Get a Nutella Mocha. Get a sandwich. Nosh on some treats (Violet Hour donuts, anyone?). Cool layout - Ipsento takes a mullet approach to the layout: business in the front and party in the back. I like it. The front room is all coffee presses, foam, windows, chairs, conversation, and lots of light. Get your food here, check out the street scene or shoop. In back is where you'll find the shabby chic (do people still say this?) furniture, cool tables, and fun seating. If you're doing something a bit more intense (studying, having 'the/a' talk), I suggest you do it back here. And, then drink an Ipsento. Awesome staff - Tim (the owner) is great. His managers are great. The rest of the staff is great. They offer brewing classes that educate folks on the coffee you're drinking and how/why you make the perfect cup. Much like wine and beer, the perfect cup of coffee is an art & science and the folks at Ipsento are well-versed in what you should drink, how, why, and when (I'll throw in a who just to round it out).

I've never had the food so can't talk to that aspect of the cafe.  Nor shall I comment on the interior space for lounging/studying/eating.  I've heard people describe it as walking in on someone's living room and I'd have to agree.  It's kinda odd walking in or by the place but it gives it a unique feel, which helps differentiate it.   Next time you're in Bucktown and are in the mood for a walk, I say stop and pick up a drink here before you do so.  It's a great way to enjoy a Sunday morning.",0.9794,0.803,0.152,0.046,0.5678571428571428

Ipsento is wonderfully cozy, has a hippie literary (kind of Nerdtastic) vibe to it--check out the names of the sandwiches (love it!), feels utterly organic, and is the sort of place you can park your behind in for an afternoon (free wifi).  One thing I really like about it is the split level floors as it can cater to different crowds & needs. 1st floor some tables, a nice window seating area, and the counter where you order.  2nd level--room for your more quiet study or work--have a very library feel to it--I tried to sit up there, but felt I had to be uber quiet, so I meandered back down to the 1st level (ah, much better for this chatty chic!).   Food & Drink---yum!  Coffee is brewed nice & strong just the way I like and served in generous mugs (Yay!).  I had one of their scones on a recent visit and even though it was in the evening (half off baby--yay!), it was still delicious.  Looking forward to going back for lunch some day and you should too. Location is conveniently located about 2 blocks from the Western Blue line stop, has plenty of street parking...NON-METERED (woot woot!!), and is open till a decent time for a coffee house in a non university area.",0.9928,0.809,0.176,0.016,0.49215465465465463

OK, specifics:  Already mentioned here is the Ipsento.  It is a latte with part milk of your choice, part coconut milk, honey, and cayenne pepper.  I do not drink lattes.  The caffeine wigs me out, makes my heart race.  But somehow (and it might be just my enthusiasm about the taste.  I LOVE COCONUT MILK), somehow the mix of coconut milk and espresso measures the way the buzz hits my body and I can easily function after a large (with 2 shots instead of the offered 3).    I had the Ernest Hemmingway sandwich along with my first Ipsento (OK WHERE do they get these croissants!!!!????

They have free coffee on friday mornings. FREE. And so much more. The only negative is that I wish they were open later!

However, I am a sucker so small shops so that fits my needs. The play a mix of music including Cold War Kids, Brandi Carlile, and other current names. The staff is really chill, even when you are struggling to decide. (RARE!) I got the Ipsento with soy and the trail mix scone. It was love. They delivered it to my seat as I red the paper. The coffee is sweet with a kick, and is super smooth. The scone is savory and somewhat salty so it was the perfect mix with my drink. I have been back several times since. The Ipsento is also good cold and I am hoping to try one of their sandwiches soon.

Not enough outlets to plug in computer (only 2 tables next to outlets, two other outlets near comfy chairs, meaning that I am currently typing this with my computer on my lap) 2. Early hours - no night time hours and closes early on the weekend 3. Music all over the place depending on who is plugging in their iPod. Hell thy name is shuffle. 4. The foam on my capp wasn't very well made. My dry capp was more wet than I like. Unacceptable things: 1. Lack of abundant power makes it more challenging to settle here for more than a couple hours. Not an ideal location for 'office away from home' unless you happen to snag one of the 'good' tables. The best thing about my visit to Ipsento was that I was not subjected to the AOR whims of the barista. I am still recovering from the Phish album I was forced to listen to yesterday at Star Lounge Cafe and my ears and brain needed the break.",0.9383,0.784,0.136,0.079,0.5468137254901961
2007-10-26,5.0,"Last year I was walking to McDonald's to get a coffee while working from home, when I ran into Rachael cleaning her windows for Ipsento's opening.  I stopped and asked when they would be open and told her that I was so excited that a coffee shop was opening up so close.  After being to McDonald's and some other coffee shops in the area I was very optimistic about Ipsento.  Other coffee shops in the area had weird hours and didn't provide quality drinks.   After going into Ipsento a couple times and trying a variety of things, I fell in love with the place and the owners.  I applaud their willingness to listen to their customers and really evaluate the changing needs of the neighborhood.   Within one year Ipsento has added more sandwiches, salads and breakfast ""goodness"" to their menu and also adding outdoor seating, making their shop even more appealing than just a coffee shop.  Not to mention they have music nights, movie nights and participate in promoting local artists as well as promoting neighborhood activities.  I love walking past every day and seeing the forecast for the next two days.  I also love how the owners make the atmosphere very welcoming.  Not only do I talk to the owners when I go there, but because of the welcoming environment I've struck up conversations with other customers.  How many places in Chicago can you really feel like you are part of a community.  Not many!  This place embodies what Chicago really stands for a big city with a small town feel.  I strongly recommend trying out Ipsento...and on those COLD COLD Chicago winter mornings, when you get your coffee and a smile..you'll remember why it is you moved to Chicago in the first place.",0.9803,0.86,0.123,0.018,0.458611111111111

Not sure where the funeral parlor comment came from, it's certainly a far cry from anything of that nature. I would highly recommend venturing over to Ipsento if you haven't already.

2007-10-22,4.0,"my only real complaint is that ipsento seems to have weird hours.  it does not open until 7 am and closes at 7 pm.  i guess it's understandable-family owned business...but still.  considering the work day that most people hold, it seems like you want coffee before 7 and want to hang out and study past 7...especially on the weekends.  i have no idea what the hours really are on sundays--everytime i walk or drive by it seems to be closed.  latte was great-i like that they give me the option of how many shots i want.  obviously, i went with the full 4.   i definitely will be back again...assuming i happen to walk by during business hours.",0.5423,0.847,0.1,0.053,0.4538461538461538
2007-10-10,2.0,"NOTE TO OWNERS:  Do not hire people that risk ruining your reputation. I went there today excited and hopeful at another promising coffee shop experience and was disappointed solely by the rudeness and frigid behavior of the woman behind the counter.  Instead of greeting me when I walked in, she was reading something and finally asked, ""do you know what you want?""  Yes, I said.  A cup of coffee. (thinking to myself, do you think you can handle handing me a cup, or is that too much of a distrurbance for you?) That immediately turned me off.  There was only one other person there, so you think they'd be grateful for your business, and I felt unwanted in a place that could be so homey and welcoming.  The one-room area feels like a living room, the music is relaxed, and the space is clean and nice.  I would've gotten food and stayed for awhile, but after my cup of extremely stong coffee, I wanted to get out of there. Don't waste your time.  Walk up the street toward Pura Belleza where the people actually want you there and treat you with respect.",0.9692,0.794,0.165,0.041,0.6482142857142857

2007-07-27,4.0,"I have some basic rules for any coffee place I'll give money to, namely 1) that it not be Starbucks (really any humongous chain) 2) have good coffee that's not ridiculously overpriced 3) have that intangible but vital 'vibe'.  I know, it sounds pretentious, but sitting if I wanted to sit in a sterile cafeteria I'd hang out in a hospital's lunch room.  Bonus for free wifi. This place has all those points covered, which is surprisingly difficult in Chicago for some reason.  It's a bit quieter than other places (like Alliance Bakery), but that's cool - it's much smaller, and I have headphones on all the time anyway.  There's the free wifi here (don't abuse it you slobs who buy a tiny coffee and park yourselves there for five hours playing World of Warcraft!), outdoor seating, and the husband/wife owners are far too cute for their own good.  This is no see-and-be-seen place (like Filter is... was... still is... whatever) but that's a good thing.  Also it's in an area that needs a good cafe. Slightly later hours would make this place a five star...",0.9919,0.744,0.227,0.028,0.6224999999999999

2007-03-27,4.0,"I was waiting for the Western Avenue movie theater to open and needed a place not too far away to grab some more coffee, and damn am I glad I stopped in here instead of going anywhere else! The place is small but cozy and the pixie behind the counter was not only friendly but she complimented my tee shirt, which is an automatic 'i like you!' in my book. The cranberry scone was great (from Red Hen, according to the chalkboard out front), and the coffee was terrific. I noticed a lot of well placed, well organized art--seemingly local--on the walls, and the unisex restroom was adorably up some stairs, and it was nice and clean. I don't know why I liked that it was up some stairs. I just did. The music was soft but nothing whiny, and they started playing Led Zeppelin (quietly) just as I was leaving. From the other reviews, I now know they have free WI-fi, and I might make this a regular joint!",0.9883,0.727,0.222,0.051,0.6152389277389279
