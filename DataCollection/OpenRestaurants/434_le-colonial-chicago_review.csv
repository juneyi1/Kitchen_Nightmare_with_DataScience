For entrees, we ordered the Mi Xao Don Chay (tofu and veggies), Ga Xao Xa Ot (Lemongrass Chicken - delicious), Crispy Duck, and a Beef Filet Noodle dish.

The staff was very attentive and flexible when we added an additional guest to our reservation. At any moment in time our waiter could be found nearby and taking care of anything we needed.  Our group ordered several appetizers to share before the meal. Each dish came with plenty of garnish and a delicious homemade sauce. After hearing rave reviews, I ordered the scallop salad as my entree. It was tasty, but definitely not my absolute favorite. In fact, my scallops were slightly undercooked.

Everything continued on the right track throughout the evening.  Our waitress was lovely, polite, attentive and efficient. We started out with a Pho and numerous appetizers, including the Cha Gio(crispy, fried spring rolls) and the Bo Nuong(grilled beef short ribs) to name a few. Each appetizer was unique in its flavor, each with a different, light and tasty sauce. Excellent.  The entrees were equally spectacular. The duck was crispy and tender and delicious.  The others were also excellent.  There was not one dish that we didn't enjoy.  The Crispy Banana Wonton with the dark chocolate sauce hit the spot and finished off a wonderful meal.

My friends and I (party of 4, all Vietnamese btw) made reservations for dinner here on a Friday night. Best to make reservations for this place. We ordered chao tom for appetizer (comes in 4 small grilled shrimp rolls). It was delicious and the sauce was addicting. We shared an order of pho (the famous viet beef noodle soup), ca nuong la chuoi (grilled trout wrapped in banana leaf), mango chicken salad, and bo bitet tom nuong (filet mignon & shrimp). They were all fresh and perfectly flavored. I cannot say anything bad or negative about the food. I would skip the grilled trout though..a bit unique taste but my friends and I loved the pho & filet mignon/shrimp dish. The only issue here is the pricing...honestly, if you go to Argyle/Uptown area for the same viet dishes, your bill would be 1/2 the price (if not, even cheaper). But..you are paying for the fine dining experience and freshness of the quality of the food. A cool thing that happened was our waitress was so kind to give us complimentary dessert for the birthday girl after we inquired if there was any specials for birthdays (they normally don't have complimentary desserts).

They sat us promptly. The room is old style, with what looks like a hammered tin ceiling. The tables are a bit snug--we ended up overhearing and conversing with the people at the table next to us, but the room was very comfortable. The food was uniformly good. We started with the tuna tartare, more sweet than spicy, with crispy triangles and cucumber slices, a great start. I then had the oxtail soup, a mini-pho with rice noodles in a deeply flavorful beef broth with beef slices.  For our main courses, we had a mixture of dishes. My spouse had the shrimp curry with jasmine rice, also a bit sweet, with nice large shrimp. I had the roast duck with chili dipping sauce. The duck was well seasoned (tasted like five spice seasoning) with crispy skin, a nice-sized portion. I love duck and it was very well prepared--the dipping sauce was great. There are various desserts, and we tried the tapioca/banana pudding--delicious, if a bit more watery than you might expect. With a couple drinks, it came to $140, including tip.

I've been to Chicago many times since the last time I ate here, but tonight was the first time I had the chance to come back here for dinner. One of my favorite things about Le Colonial is the atmosphere they have created. I haven't been to Vietnam, but this is what I would envision without ever being there first hand, complete with spinning fans hanging from the ceiling. The staff has been wonderful on both visits from the manager, to the hostess, and everyone else in between. You won't have an empty dish on your table long and you will never run out of water. Long story short, the red snapper. Order it. It's delicious, and quite frankly, one of my favorite meals I've ever had. It you're adverse to some small pin bones, well, I can't help you much there, but I do prefer the table-side filet option to save myself from the effort. The sauce is wonderful, not too sweet, not too spicy - and perfect with the side of rice.

The squash and Japanese eggplant soaked up all the complex flavors of the curry. I was planning on bagging half of the dish to-go, but ended up devouring the entirety of it with some much needed rice. The drinks were phenomenal also. I loved the lychee cocktail I got.

I came for restaurant week and ordered off of the $44 price fix menu. I had the tuna tartare, the bo sate (diced filet mignon with green beans and sweet potatoes) with a side of fried rice, and the chocolate mousse cake to round out the night. My favorite part of the meal was the extremely tender filet mignon in the bo sate. The fried rice was also surprisingly good, considering I picked it as a side dish and didn't expect much. It was made of fluffy long-grain rice, with scrambled egg, scallions, shredded chicken, and broccoli, and it was not greasy at all. Yum!  I also ordered the S.V.G. martini (mango, lychee, and lime flavored, if I remember correctly). It was sweet and refreshing, but for $13, I expected to be impressed and it was underwhelming. I wouldn't order another cocktail next time.  Ultimately, the prices felt a bit steep for the portion size. I don't consider myself someone with an overly big appetite, but I was able to finish pretty much everything on the 3 course menu without a problem and I didn't even feel stuffed at the end. I guess that's what you get for eating in Gold Coast. Another complaint is that the tables are too close together.

It was just the right level of spice and I kind of wanted to steal all the pho for myself (instant regret with the sharing!) We also got the chicken curry (with mango)...the chicken was juicy, the curry complemented it quite well, and the mango just added an extra ""pizzaz"" to the flavors, everything went really well. We also got their shrimp with asparagus and that was very good/a nice contrast the chicken curry. Keep in mind they encourage more family style dining so get dishes to share! We also tried the drinks, I got the spicy le piquet and my friend got the eternal youth. The eternal youth is on the mintier side if that's your taste, while le piquet was well...on the spicier side.

Usually Vietnamese foods are quite tasty and they are cheap as well. This restaurant was just the opposite. They serve bad food with high price. The only thing we liked was the decor.

They serve it atop lettuce, cilantro, mint, carrot and onion. The idea is to wrap your fried spring roll with the lettuce and other ingredients. It was sooo good. You get four small rolls and is good for 1-2 people. For the main course I ordered the Tau Hu Cari which was an array of vegetables with tofu in a coconut curry. It had a good assortment of vegetables, the curry was balanced and tasty. It also came with a large plate of rice. The amount served was just right for me. Finished the meal with the Coconut Macaroon. It was good, not overly exciting though. The vanilla ice cream hardens the macaroon so it's hard to cut into. It has toasted coconut shavings which I liked. It's drizzled with chocolate and has a rather elaborate presentation which made the dessert worth ordering. I do think it's a bit pricey for what you're getting and hence the 4 star. Another reviewer commented your paying for the ambiance and location - I agree.

Here it's good to know what condiments are and which ones compliments the dish you are choosing to order.  Some dishes it's good to already know how it should taste because once you eat it, you'll appreciate how well it was prepared and will be able to compare it what you've had before.   It's great to talk to the staff because they will tell you all about it.   I've tried pretty much everything on the menu and have not found anything that i did not like.   One of My favorites is the Bo Luc Lac (beef salad) the beef is as tender as can be.    Served over watercress and other bitter greens.   Topped with a light red wine vinegarette dressing and lightly fried onions.    Absolute yum!    The Pho is very good as well.   Served with beef and oxtail.  The broth seasoning is exquisite!  The ca ri ga and banh cuon is also a must try .  The lunch portions are small IMO, so if you're hungry i would suggest ordering a side dish.

Service was exceptional - very attentive and super friendly.   For the food, we literally wanted to order all the appetizers and salads.  Alas, we are just 2 people who couldn't eat all the things... though we tried:   - Scallop Salad: Our favorite salad, hands down.  The garlic noodles and crisp flat green beans, mixed with fresh herbs and fried garlic made this a combinations of textures and flavors that is to-die-for.  We'd order this again for sure. - Lotus Root Salad: Also good, but a little underwhelming as we tried it after the Scallop Salad.  Loved the crunchy lotus root and freshness of the dressing. - Beignet Shrimp: Good, but not great.  The orange sauce was a little too tangy for my taste, but the shrimp was tasty.  Beignet interior was a lot softer than I expected.  - Grilled Beef in Rice Roll: Really tasty! It's like dim sum (churng fun/rice crepe), with vietnamese sesame beef.  It sat in what tasted like nuoc mam sauce - so, so good.  A bit of mint and fried garlic on top and it was perfection.  Inhaled within seconds, and it was a great portion size. - Monkfish with Sesame Crackers: Another really interesting and well executed appetizer.  The sesame crackers were nice and crunchy - thicker than I expected, as I thought it would be more like a shrimp chip.  It held on to the monkfish mixture very well.  There is some spice to this, so beware if you can't handle it! - Chilean Sea Bass: Delicious, and truly like butter (as was mentioned in some other reviews). A bit too saucy for me, but I'm glad I tried it! - Chicken/Veg Fried Rice: Tasty, a little different than the chinese kind, though I can't decipher why/how.  There are some nice crunchy greens added in. - Macaroon w/ Ice Cream: REALLY GREAT!  Ice cream and macaroon was awesome.  We could barely fit anything in at this point, but had to finish it.  The macaroon was quite dense and not so easy to break into.  Once you do, it is all chewy coconut-y goodness.  Ice cream was fantastic. - Banana Tapioca Pudding: Took this to go - haven't tried it yet.

For was just average and not as good as our favorite Thai restaurant. The restaurant was supposed to be atmospheric and romantic, but to us it was just dark and too hot upstairs. Bouillabaisse was overpriced and under seasoned. Broth tasted like water, without the anticipated saffron richness. The duck entree was tasty, but rather tough. Veggie side was mostly book Chou, which we like, but wanted more variety.

2016-04-06,1.0,"I would like to start out by thanking Le Colonial for RUINING MY NIGHT!! I had several reasons to celebrate a special occasion with my wife and decided to give this place a try.  I heard that it was really nice and many people gave the restaurant some really nice reviews.  I actually felt that I made the right decision when we arrived because the atmosphere looked promising.  Sadly, that was the last positive memory that I will take from tonight. I made reservations a week in advance and the restaurant seemed to have many open places were we could have sat and enjoyed our night.  For some reason they opted instead to place us against the wall where they had placed several long tables pushed so close together that the host had to completely remove our table from this area so my wife could get to her seat.  Since she is pretty skinny she did not have much difficulty, I would hate to see what they would have done if we were the size of the average American. We were so close to the couples on either side of us that it felt as if we were joining them for dinner.  That probably would have been ok at most places with decent clientele but the customers at my left were some of the most obnoxious people I have ever met in Chicago.  I would not have been shocked to find out that they were auditioning for their own reality TV show.  They honestly made the Kardashians seem like humble and caring individuals.  ""I could not vote for Hillary, her assistant is married to Anthony Wiener.""  ""I actually could reject marrying someone based on their last name."" ""Why do you still have that person on your FB.""  BLAH BLAH BLAH. The waiter approached our wonderful table to give us menus and the only pleasantry that we received from him was a question on the type of water we want to drink.  He did not care to see how our evening was going or if we have been to this restaurant before.  He did not even care to describe anything on either menu or indulge my request to be placed at a better table in a location where we would not have to listen to the pollution coming out of the mouth of the lady next to me. The wine we ordered was mediocre and I would consider the food ok for a place like Panda Express but a lot more expensive.  It came out fast and simple enough that I could have made it at home.  It was such a disappointment that I could not even stomach looking at the desert menu and left as soon as the check was paid.  I am even embarrassed to tell anyone how much I paid for this experience because it was a huge ripoff and a complete waste of money. After we left, I felt that Le Colonial is in a perfect location to serve the people of the Viagra Belt. While the atmosphere can fool many people into paying more than they should, my recommendation is AVOID this place unless you are from the area and prefer this type of experience.  If yelp would have allowed me to leave Zero Stars, I would have.",0.8658,0.811,0.106,0.083,0.4921382189239331

Let me preface this review by saying that I had to listen to two college-age girls at the table next to me talk endlessly about their bad dating history. Seriously these two girls had too much drama. Back to the important stuff. The restaurant decor is so nice with the white table linen, staircase, and decorative plants and mirrors around the dining rooms. The food presentation was great, the quality of the food was excellent, and the service was very attentive. I ordered the Chao Tom which was grilled shrimp wrapped around sugar cane.

It was dimly lit with candles on every table and soft music gently drifting through the air. He dragged me out to try to ""turn that frown upside-down"" and this place had promise. It seemed to be a very nice reprieve from the hustle and bustle outside. We were seated (immediately) behind a folding screen and tucked away in a corner. High praises for intimacy because I'm all about that while dining....or anything else. With Saigon Sisters being my favorite Vietnamese restaurant, I couldn't help but compare though. And Le Colonial just came up sort of flat for me. We always order a lot of food. I'm sure we look amusing. --two people at one tiny table completely filled with food. Drinks barely clinging to the edges. We both are types who like to try a bunch of things and have no qualms with packing it up and bringing the rest home. Goi Cuon (soft salad rolls with a plum dipping sauce). They were exactly as all spring rolls always are. Light and good. I've yet to have any from any restaurant that stand apart. Whether a chain restaurant or an independent, they all taste good but all taste the same. Vit Quay (Marinated Duck). Duck is either hit or miss. I'm compelled to order it in hopes of getting a hit, but this was definitely a miss. Very, very bland. Not tough though! They earned points for that! Cari Tom (Jumbo Shrimp with Japanese Eggplant in a Coconut Curry Sauce). I did indeed like this dish. The shrimp were plump and cooked perfectly. The curry was delicious.  Mien Xao (Stir-Fried Cellophane Noodles with Crabmeat) Pretty greasy and would have preferred bigger pieces of crab. It was fine. I'll just leave it at that. Nothing I ate was off-putting by any means, but nothing seemed truly innovative for being a Vietnamese Fusion restaurant. Nothing was truly captivating. We had plenty of leftovers yet opted to leave them all behind. I can't even remember the last time I turned down leftovers from a restaurant; it's the hallmark of every dining experience for me. But neither of us loved our food enough to eat it twice. At least not when the curry was already gone. And while I liked the intimacy of the corner table behind the folding screen, what I didn't know is that I was near a swinging door and I would have the wall next to me shaking throughout the entire meal. --Shaking and a lot of banging. It was such a distraction that I couldn't concentrate on anything else.  Parking is easy in this neighborhood. With an adequately priced $12 valet or a parking garage around the corner, it's all convenient.

2016-03-05,4.0,"Went here with some friends for a fine dining night out. Thankfully, Le Colonial offers a vegan menu! Pros: Vegan menu, delicious food, vegan-friendly dessert options and you actually get enough food for leftovers.  That's rare for fancypants places. They usually charge $40 for about two bites of food. The lychee sangria is basically a lychee sugar rush. I tasted more lychee than wine (not a complaint). Also, they were able to sub rice with noodles for dish 50V: Tau Hu Xao Xa. They charged me for the substitution, though. At least I still received a plate of white rice along with my entree. When I go to a Vietnamese restaurant, I want noodles. But I wanted lemongrass tofu dish, not the dish that was already a noodle dish. The noodle dish was basically tofu and veggies in chili sauce, which is pretty standard, I think. Cons: The vegan menu is very limited and one of the vegan dessert options is two scoops of Ciao Bella sorbet for $7. Ciao Bella? For $7? You can get a pint of that at Whole Foods for $5. Puh-lease. I went with the banana pudding in coconut milk. That was good stuff, but tasted like breakfast. My inner activist is also not pleased with naming a restaurant after colonialism. I mean, really? I wouldn't name a cajun/creole restaurant La Antebella, even if the cuisine was a fusion of French and foods native to the southern US. Despite my politics (I pick my battles), I enjoyed the food and definitely will come back when I want to treat myself (or a friend) to a fancy dinner.",0.9677,0.866,0.111,0.023,0.4005723443223443

The restaurant is very dimly lit with candles, perfect for a romantic dinner. The menu can be overwhelming with so many unfamiliar options to choose from, but the waitstaff is expert with recommendations. For our anniversary dinner, my boyfriend and I decided on the GA XAO CARI : Sautéed diced chicken with Japanese eggplant, mango, yams, string beans, & cashew nuts In a yellow curry sauce and the VIT QUAY: Ginger marinated roast duck with tamarind dipping sauce. The duck was perfectly cooked, juicy with crisp skin and the tamarind sauce elevated it to another level. The curry was the best either of us has had, with each layer of flavor melting into the next. The restaurant is very formal yet we saw many under dressed patrons come in. Do yourself a favor and dress nicely for this restaurant, or your food will look much prettier than you.",0.9846,0.812,0.173,0.015,0.4756944444444444

The Ca Song (tuna tartare) is not to be missed- the fish was so fresh it was buttery, and was delicately flavored so as to gently compliment the flavor of the fish. I was less impressed by the soft salad rolls that lacked any real flavor, but the monkfish appetizer was another standout that was unlike anything I've ever had before. I had the Ga Nuong Xa (lemongrass chicken) as my main dish, and while it was quite good, I think there was some room for improvement. I was essentially served a plate of chicken pieces- the whole dish would have been enhanced with some sort of vegetables on the side to make it more of an entree. All in all, a wonderful restaurant.

Atmosphere:  The whole restaurant is dimly lit, and there are candles at the table to help set the mood for a relaxing dinner. We were seated on the 1st floor in a wrap around booth which allowed us to sit close to each other. The restaurant also has a second floor area where there is a bar, tables, and bathrooms. The second floor also looked like it would be the area in which private parties could be held.  Service: The first floor dining area was at full capacity when we arrived for dinner, but service was prompt. The time in which we received our cocktails, appetizer, and meals were timed perfectly. Our waiter was professional and friendly towards us.  Food: Cocktail- I feel bad because I completely forget the name of my cocktail, but the taste was memorable in a positive way.

With Vietnamese food being less explored compared to Japanese or Chinese food, there's plenty of surprisingly good dishes to discover here. Besides the more traditional Pho which is also offered here, there's pan fried salmon with rice noodles, stir fry that isn't too heavy and yet plentiful enough, and lots of other things I've yet to try myself. Even the basic Vietnamese egg rolls come with lettuce wrap, parsley, carrot and daikon is different compared to standard rolls.

2016-02-16,4.0,"Great combination of Vietnamese-French fusion cuisine. I've been back and forth between the hub of Asian fusion cuisine on the west coast to Asia and Le Colonial definitely hits the spot. Two levels for dining: 1st floor is great for larger groups and the 2nd floor more suitable for couples / more intimate setting. For starters the drinks ordered hit the spot , properly mixed. For appetizers we ordered the 'Cha Gio' ( Crisp, fried spring rolls of shrimp, pork, & asian mushrooms, with chili lime dipping sauce) and the 'Tom Cuon Ram' (Crisp beignets stuffed with shrimp, chicken, & vegetables, served with orange ginger dipping sauce). Both were bursting with freshness and flavor - I could eat these two appetizers for another 3 rounds if I wanted to (Highly recommended!) For the entrees we went for the 'Cari Tom' ( sautéed jumbo shrimp with japanese eggplant in a coconut curry sauce) and the 'Bun Thit Nuong' (Thinly sliced, barbecued pork, served warm, over angel-hair noodles, with mesclun greens, lime garlic fish sauce & peanuts). I'm not a pork fan so I didn't try the 'Bun Thit Nuong' but from what I was told and how fast my friend ended up eating his dish, it was delicious and met his expectations. The 'Cari Tom' with jumbo shrimp was simply delicious with the creamy coconut sauce in combination with the eggplant.  Lastly the 'Le Colonial Macaroon' ( vanilla ice cream in a coconut macaroon drizzled with dark chocolate sauce) was out of this world. I was pretty full before the point of dessert but somehow redeemed myself with this dessert. I'd come back to Le Colonial for the sole purpose of this macaroon dessert!  Overall I would rate it 8/10, a bit on the pricer side for Asian fusion food , however the ambiance and quality make up for it .",0.9836,0.896,0.099,0.005,0.4432258064516129
2016-02-15,2.0,"For those who just want the summary. (15% GRATUITY APPLIED AUTOMATICALLY IF YOU LOOK YOUNG!) Not the place for Valentine's Day, very crowded in upstairs dining area, laid back service, very expensive considering the only option was a $70 3 course meal that neither of us had the appetite for and that was the only option. On the plus side, the food was fantastic! Read on to see my full review. Seating: our reservation was for 9:00 pm on Sunday night, we arrived 5 minutes early and we were sat at 9:00 exactly. We were sat in the upstairs dining area at a table that was very very small, about the size of a door mat, the chairs were small as well. The couples table next to us was exactly a foot away and we could hear everything they were saying. Neither of us felt relaxed what so ever, very uneasy feeling throughout the night. If you are over 6 feet tall and or on the heavier side, this restaurant is not the best choice. Overall rating 2/5 Service: We were sat at 9:00pm, not a single waiter, waitress, busboy, or host approached us until 9:15. For me that already set the night off to a bad start. Finally a waitress greeted us. First off, she placed the menus on both of our plates, where our napkins and eating utensils were, another strike in my book. She asked if we wanted water and then left. 9:25 pm she came back with 2 5oz glasses of water, would probably only fill up a sippy cup. Sense my girlfriend nor I are 21 and didn't feel like spending $5.00 on a glass of soda we suck with water. We had to be very conservative with it because they were only refilled 3 time throughout our night. Upon ordering she informed us that our only option on the menu was a 3 course meal for $70 a person. Now this is what really set me off, I was never noticed that our only dining option was a 3 course meal, nothing posted on the website, no emails, phone calls, nothing. They had it posted on their website for a promotion but no where did it state that you couldn't order just 1 entree. Very very poor advertising, none the less we decided to stay because we had driven 2 hours through a snow storm to get there because there was a $50 per person cancelation fee if you didn't cancel within 2 days, another strike. At 9:40 she came back to take our order. At 10:00 pm our soup and salad arrived. After finishing those, someone cleared our plates and we awaited the next course. This is where the service started to get really really slow. At 10:45 our food finally arrived, and to say the least... We were the least bit disappointed with that. I asked for a Togo box at 11:00 and we awaited a slice of chocolate mousse cake and a something else I cannot remember the same of. At 11:45pm, she finally came out with our dessert. I was absolutely fuming, it shouldn't take any restaurant, let alone any food place in the world 45 minutes to cut a slice of cake put it on a plate toss some powdered sugar on it. My girlfriends dessert had a scoop of ice cream and chocolate drizzle on top. Both of those can be ready to serve in 10 minutes tops! Upon her arrival, before she even set the plates down I asked for the check. She brought back the check and we're practically slapped in the face by it. $180, oh and not to mention the 15% gratuity included ($25 tip). Oh I lost it, our waitress did not deserve that money under any circumstances nor did the restaurant deserve it. What I also found very unpleasant was that the couple next to us and the couple next to them both left cash tips, as if the 15% wasn't automatically added. Me and my girlfriend are both 19 and we're definitely the youngest couple in the building. To me it felt like the restaurant added the tip automatically because they felt like we were not going to tip. Now it's 12:15, we have been at the restaurant for more than 3 hours and we parked in a parking garage, $55 dollars for parking. So $235 for what was supposed to be a simple night out. Very upsetting. Rating 2/10 Overall: The food was very very nice, delicious and hefty servings. We both would have enjoyed our night out if it wasn't for the reasons above. Great atmosphere . Even for the terrible service, I would be willing to go here again hoping for a better turn out. 2/5 Thanks for reading.",0.5821,0.853,0.073,0.074,0.473999748047367

The restaurant offers much more than great food; it provides diners with ""an experience"" - the new currency. --- Le Colonial is one of my favorite spots in Chicago. The food is always on point; the ambiance perpetual perfection. In terms of decor, you can't beat the French-Vietnamese influences nor the scripted neon signage out front. The end result of Jean Denoyer's careful curation is a Gold-Coast mainstay with a vibe that is light and sexy, even in the dead of winter.  From the second you arrive outside, you'll feel as though you've been whisked away to a foreign country. Between the cocktails and curries, you simply cannot order wrong. (I recommend the Ga Xao Cari, but the entire menu is a win). Dinner or drinks always feel intimate, thanks to a well-designed space with a strategic use of greenery. Never stuffy, Le Colonial works for both a clandestine business meeting or steamy second date alike. You don't need to dress-up to dine here, but you'll want to...

2016-01-30,5.0,"Le Colonial is absolutely fantastic... one of my favorite asian restaurants in all of Chicago! Would highly recommend anything from the restaurant week lunch menu! The rice paper rolls were a fantastic appetizer airing on the lighter side due to the restaurant's use of fresh, crisp carrot slices, bean sprouts, jicama, and lettuce. In addition, I really enjoyed how a faint peanut essence translated across the dish. The crushed peanut pieces inside of the rolls added the right amount of texture to balance out the soft and sticky nature of the rice paper covering, and served to complement the peanut plum sauce. All in all, a noticeable nuttiness brought the dish together while striking the careful balance of not becoming too overpowering. I also really loved the lemongrass chicken, although the portion size of the main course was a bit on the heavier side. The tangy yet slightly spicy chicken was tender/ easy to cut into and was soaked in a fresh, sharp basil sauce. Lastly, the mango Caio Bella sorbet was also mouth-watering, extremely sweet and sticky, similar to how a ripe, freshly picked mango would be! The food was fantastic! The service was great!

I originally came for Restaurant Week, but upon seeing the menu, I changed my mind and ended up ordering off the normal menu. #6 Banh Cuon (steamed ravioli with chicken & chili lime garlic sauce): I didn't enjoy as much as other Yelpers seemed to suggest I would--the texture of the ground chicken was a bit tough and didn't quite go with the rest of the filling-- but nevertheless I still appreciated the delicate flavors.  # 8 Banh Uot (grilled beef wrapped in rice noodle): I loved the juiciness of the beef and the sesame marinade, which went very well with the cucumber and lettuce salad. A bit on the salty side, but one of my favorite orders. Other noteworthy things I tasted included the cha gio (#1, fried spring rolls). Normally, I tend to stay away from fried spring rolls because the batter tends on the oily side; however, at Le Colonial, the skin of the spring was light and crispy, and the chili lime garlic sauce made for a delicious addition to the light, fragrant flavors of the spring roll. The bun thit nuong (#25, barbequed pork over rice noodles) was quite good as well--the barbequed pork had was deliciously fragrant and the perfect balance between sweet and salty.

2015-11-20,2.0,"Le Colonial is no longer the Five star Vietnamese restaurant it was a few years ago.   My husband and I were in Chicago this week for the Chicago Architecture Biennial and fondly remembered a delicious lunch we had at Le Colonial approximately five years ago; at that time we had one of their signature dishes, the whole Red Snapper.  We had a great lunch and great memories. Upon our return to Chicago this trip we went back to Le Colonial and were given an initial warm greeting followed by an incredibly condescending and hostile waiter.  I don't need to describe this person because anyone who has dined there recently will know who this male waiter is.  He has a distinct and easily visible chip on his shoulder. There was nothing we could see about our waiter that would justify his arrogant and condescending manner, towards not just us, but everyone in general.   The white table cloth was also dirty with a white sauce from previous customers smeared on the upper top corner, which the staff member who seated us simply rubbed off with a rag while seating us.  It was off putting but we wanted the window table so we overlooked this unpleasant fact.   In any event, as things progressed, it was quite clear that our waiter was barely tolerating our presence (perhaps because it was at the end of the lunch hour and they were busy).   From the moment my husband requested the wine list to the ordering of our food, our waiter was unfriendly, condescending and borderline rude.  Despite these disappointing facts, we shared several delicious dishes including eggplant, prawns, chicken and the whole Red Snapper which we paired with two bottles of German Riesling from the Mosel, and we had a great time. The food was delicious but a dining experience is not just about the food, it's about the ambiance and experience; so, as a result of the dirty table cloth and unpleasant condescending waiter we had, I doubt we will return. management needs to make some changes to their restaurant staff.",-0.4827,0.798,0.099,0.102,0.4561660561660561

2015-09-27,3.0,I haven't often written a review on yelp- but my experience here last night with my mother and aunt compels me to. When we were first seated we had a lovely experience- the environment and ambiance of the restaurant is really amazing and our waiter was nice and attentive. However as soon as another couple was seated next to us our waiter literally stopped mid sentence to attend to them. For the rest of the night we were treated like dirt and neglected. The couple which had arrived 15 minutes after us had their wine and appetizers before all three of us even had a drink.  Things were awkward and uncomfortable the rest of the evening. The waiter knew we weren't pleased and lost us. He rarely came to check on us and when he did spoke to us in a condescending manner.  I was really disappointed because the food was great and I was excited to show my aunt and mom the place as they were just in town to visit me. However the waiter truly ruined the experience. I hate to say it but if there were a man at the table I believe we would have been treated with a little more respect. Update: a few days after posting this review a customer service representative contacted me to apologize for my experience.

Don't expect French fusion cooking, as there is little French culinary influence, but the setting will definitely transport you to 1950s French Colonial Vietnam. We put ourselves in our waiter's hands, and he knocked it out of the park, serving us two appetizers, two salads and two entrees. Nearly all of them were something we would not have ordered, but will definitely order again. We preferred the appetizers and salads to the entrees, and would concentrate on those areas of the menu on our next visit. We began with a ravioli that was made from amazingly thin and delicate layers, and bursting with flavor. This was probably my favorite dish. We also had the wok seared monkfish, which was slightly spicy, and served with crisp sesame crackers. Our salad course consisted of a filet mignon and watercress salad (reminiscent of Thai waterfall beef) and a lotus root and crispy tofu salad that was a knockout. Not being a big tofu fan, I would never have ordered this, but it was my other favorite. Our entrees were a sautéed shrimp dish, and sautéed filet mignon with yams and green beans.  These were both good, but not as good as the previous dishes. For dessert we had an ice cream and macaroon dish that was fine, but not special. A nice selection of wines designed to accompany the food is available, with a particularly fine selection of Champagnes by the glass.

Service was decent, but not as attentive as I would have expected for the price (e.g. tried flagging down our waiter twice before getting his attention to get the bill, and he only had 2-3 tables to cover). The decor is very agreeable and indeed ""colonial."" Food was very fresh, healthy, like it had been in the past. That said, I really don't think the price is justified by anything other than the neighbourhood, and I suspect that one can travel to Argyle and have equivalent culinary experiences for half the price (based on previous experiences, I have not verified this statement recently).",0.9544,0.829,0.136,0.036,0.4090277777777779

If you're familiar with Asian cuisine or have an Asian background, avoid this place and head to the Vietnam town in Chicago instead. The food quality does not justify the high price tag. We ordered multiple dishes (don't remember the names), but the soup was bland, the noodles only came with little meat which doesn't justify the ~$30 price tag, and the chicken stir fry was so average I would rather eat at Panda. Pho was good but it was too expensive. You could get just as good pho for much cheaper somewhere else.

In regards to the service, our waiter was really weird.  He hardly ever approached my table, and whenever I flagged him over, he would look away, wait, and then approach.  Really weird. However, there was another waiter that came by to chat with us, his name was Alfredo, he was extremely sweet.  Nevertheless, it was an uncomfortable experience, and I do not believe I will return to this restaurant.",-0.4388,0.888,0.052,0.06,0.4951754385964912

Anyway, it was my birthday so we got a sitter, then I was stressed about choosing the best place to go! I have heard Le Colonial mentioned a lot, but never been and it definitely isn't new, but I was intrigued. I made a reservation on Open Table (which my husband thinks always puts us in the worst seat in the restaurant, lol) and I think some of the reviews on here said it was a dressy place. We were a little worried when we walked in and we saw a guy in a 3 piece suit! Haha, anyway, it's not intimidating, but I wouldn't wear your beach outfit.  We got there early so we had a drink at the bar even though our table was ready. I got a tropical martini and it was super strong, and delish! We took our seats and we would up at the best table in the place! We were seated upstairs on the balcony (it's heated in the winter) in the very corner. Super quiet and romantic spot. It was fun looking down on Rush street around the holiday time.  We started with the Banh Cuon, which is like a ravioli, and Tom Cuon Ram, which were like deep fried yumminess. Both were great, I think the Tom Cuon Ram was the favorite. We had to try the Pho while we were there so we split an order. It was so good! Definitey enough to share too. For dinner I had the Bun Thit Nuong, which is BBQ Pork of thin noodles and it was awesome. In fact, I think about it a lot and how great it was. It was light which I really liked and full of flavor. My husband had the Bo Sate, which was also really really good. For dessert we had the banana wonton and it was super delish and kinda different, a nice change of pace. They had a great wine list as well, which I think it worth mentioning.  I was so surprised at such a great time we had. Not that I didn't expect it, but I didn't think it would be as awesome an experience as it was! Would love to go back!",0.9992,0.692,0.288,0.021,0.5740500240500241
2015-01-04,4.0,"When my friend, Sonya, suggested Le Colonial, I thought she meant the family restaurant Colonial Cafe that serves ice cream by the kitchen sink. She said no...no...no...no...definitely not that Colonial. Phew!! Of course I should have known better, since she's a chef, that she would suggest a good restaurant to go to. She didn't let me down. She actually never lets me down. What a great night! It has been awhile since I saw my friends from culinary school. With a bunch of trained practising and non practising chefs, being critical was going to be part of the flavor tonight. I thought I was always the responsible dependable one at school. Sure enough, I was the first one there, on time. While waiting at the bar, I ordered a lychee sangria. Whoah!! That was good!! It had me by the first sip. I drank it so fast while hungry that I felt the alcohol quite quickly. The ambience of the restaurant was definitely swanky downtowny type. There were some gentlemen sitting by me that got pretty loud but they were not obnoxious. It was a fun upper scale atmosphere.  They had two dining rooms, upstairs and downstairs. The downstairs looked very ""colonial"" style, of older quaint almost southern look. It was intimate and romantic. It would be a great spot for a date. Upstairs, by the bar, they had sofas for people to wait, drink, eat, or make out. I saw them all being done on those sofas. There were make believe banana plants all around that made the room looked like we're somewhere in South East Asia. When the girls showed up, we started ordering appetizers and we were all famished. We ordered a bunch and they were all delicious! Those appetizers really started the mood right and no one was being critical but we chowed down and cursing and talking about Valerie's second butt hole. Apparently she tore her butt open at a drunken party where a guy fell on a coffee table she was sitting on and one of the shards of glass impaled her in the ass. It was a good time talking about shit like that as we were wolfing down egg rolls, shrimp beignets, tuna tartare, and spring rolls. Each of the appetizer was tasty. We were pretty happy especially after we finished the first round of cocktails. The entrées weren't disappointing either. I ordered the fried wide rice noodle with shrimp and beef and it was superb. It didn't have the charred taste like I would have had it in Asia, but it was still tasty. The shrimps were humongous and they gave me a lot of it! Val got the thin rice noodle with marinated pork. She liked the pork but she was confused with the amount of noodles on her plate. It was way too much noodles. Sonya loved her vegan tofu curry. I tried a little and it had a nice taste of mango in it. Christina got the sea bass with cellophane noodles. It didn't look good to me but the fish was very tasty. Natasha got the seafood bouillabaise in coconut milk, now that's hells yeah delicious! That thing filled with fish, shrimps, lobster in this silky yellow saffron broth. Wish I ordered that! Desserts.. I ordered the pearl tapioca pudding that was mild. It was a good palate cleanser; but it could withstand a little more flavor. It was a little bland to me. The banana wonton with crème anglaise was great though. It was crunchy and banana-y and hot and sweet and creamy. What's not to like? I didn't get a whole lot of the French influence in the food, more that it was elevated Vietnamese food. Yea, we had ""bouillabaise"" and ""crème anglaise.. But I dunno, I couldn't go as far as it is a mixed of French and Vietnamese. Now, if I saw coq au vin cooked in Vietnamese rice wine and fish sauce, maybe. The French influence was in the light side I guess.  Service wise, it was just ok. Our server left in the middle of our meal and she didn't even say good bye. All of a sudden, we got two new people helping us. One more thing, we can't transfer tab from bar to the table.  In summary, I was pleasantly surprised. I had been up and down Rush Street in my Chicago days and I never really saw this place before. It was tucked in nicely between all these fancy stores in Gold Coast but it's a cool nice place. I'd go again in a heart beat. People also said that they have the best pho in town. I just couldn't get myself to order pho there though. It doesn't need to be fancy schmanzy to eat pho, but I thought I share what I heard.  We had such a fabulous time! Not only the food was great, the conversation was borderline insane! I forgot how crazy we could get. I didn't remember last time I talked about fake boobs and choo choos in the same sentence. It was great to sit back and have fun with old friends and reminisced about classes making nantua to tying your cravat correctly. Now, we have all gone our separate ways but we can always connect through food and friendships. Till next time, friends.",0.9995,0.773,0.196,0.031,0.5312564419707279
2015-01-02,3.0,"Will preface this review by saying I will definitely come back, and would recommend it as a great place to have a relatively high-end Vietnamese dinner in the area.  Came in with reservations and was promptly seated by the hostess. Service thereafter was spotty, at best, thereafter. Aside from waters being refilled, it took roughly 25 minutes for a waiter to inquire on our order for drinks or dinner. The food was very, very good and was brought out probably in 15-20 minutes after ordering, and the wine shortly before that. We had the Cari Tom (shrimp in a curry sauce) and Bo Sate (beef with sweet potatoes & long beans) and both were excellently prepared.  After we were done eating, and our plates had been cleared by bussers, it took another 20-25 minutes to be presented with a dessert menu (declined) and the check. Again, the food was excellent, but the service drops the rating down a point (and dropping down another point for the price I guess - dishes were $23-28 / ea, wine ranges from $40 - $150++).

The cocktails were also well received.  It was a little pricey but I don't mind paying for good service and well prepared food.

It was at that moment, I knew...my life was going to change. I ordered the #24 as my main course. Oven roasted chicken with a small bowl of chili lime dipping sauce.  I was overcome with so many emotions at that time. Never in my life.  Never.  Have I had chicken like that! Juicy. Succulent. Omg.  Of course the lady wanted desert so we were recommended the Banana Wonton with Vanilla ice cream. I took one bite and began speaking fluent French and Vietnamese.  When I came back to my senses I enjoyed every bite of the crispy pastry. Besides the obnoxious table of 15 behind us,who's inside voices were like at a 110 with 5 being the maximum, I have no regrets or reservations about Le Colonial.

2014-10-16,3.0,"Knowing this restaurant is an institution on the Gold Coast, I was curious to check it out. I did enjoy taking in the decor, which put me in mind of another restaurant, Les Nomades, with its French interior (think: dark furnishings, antiques, Oriental Rugs). I was the advance party as my dining companion had not arrived, so I checked in with the hostess downstairs and made my way to the bar and dining area on the second floor. As a note, there are stairs to climb to get there, which I point out because I had a recent hip surgery. Fortunately, I was hale enough to take on the staircase, but those who aren't able to manage stairs might need to make sure they are accommodated, seeing as how there was no elevator in evidence. The second floor bar was excellent and my dirty martini was really good. My companion and I ended up having a drink at the bar, before being shown to our table. I guess this is an intimate restaurant setup, as the table was a two top and it was pretty close to the adjacent table. We actually needed to move off the small orchid vase and candle - thankfully there was a ledge nearby - to make room for the food. When it came to wine, we were told that the bordeaux was out of stock, so ended up going with a serviceable Oregon Pinot Noir. The food itself came out very quickly. No complaints here, as we were  hungry, but I found it curious that the pacing was more evocative of a PF Chang's, while the ambiance bespoke a leisurely dining experience. I was a fan of the appetizers - spring rolls and a mushroom-dumpling type dish more so than the entrees. I went with the salmon, which came with some vegetables and vermicelli noodles. My dining companion ordered something that looked like it had a chili sauce, with meat and bits of yams. It was difficult to see the food, as the restaurant was dark. I prefer to see what I am eating. I would also have preferred the dishes to be hotter- by temperature. The dishes came to our table tepid.I probably won't add this restaurant to my rotation, but I'm glad I finally had the chance to check it out, thanks to an out-of-town dinner guest, and see what all the fuss is about.",0.9827,0.845,0.114,0.041,0.5754960317460318

It took a few minutes before I was handed a menu after I was seated. I could see the bus boys trying to discreetly flag down a waiter for me. I got the pho. Smallest bowl of pho I've had in my life. Broth was a bit sweet for me, all the pho fixin's were already in the bowl when it was served (bean sprouts, cilantro, scallion, chili), with a like wedge and sauce on the side. There were also only 3 pieces of beef. My food came super quick, not sure if it's because they just wanted to get me out (just kidding) or because pho is that easy (I prefer to think the latter). The waiter checked on me once, when I was basically done eating, and I asked for the check.  2 stars because it was an $11 meal for a tiny bowl that wasn't the best I've had, for 3 pieces of meat.

My aunt and I ordered five dishes total: two appetizers, two entrees, and dessert. We started off with the Goi Cuon Ga--salad rolls that were light, tasty, and full of flavor. I think the cilantro made all the difference. It reminded me of summer rolls that my friend's mom made for me earlier this year. We had the Banh Cuon, which was basically the most unique ravioli I've ever had. Personally, I liked the lightness of the salad rolls better as an appetizer, but the ravioli was still delicious. Never heard of it before, so probably worth a try. For our main dishes, we ordered the Bo Bitet Tom Nuong. O. M. G. The steak was amazing. Definitely the highlight of the meal. It was so flavorful and juicy. Definitely get this! The shrimp was pretty good, the rice was okay, but the STEAK. Just, go get it. We also ordered the Ga Xao Xa Ot. Very very good, and a pretty nice complement to the heaviness of the steak dish. For dessert, we had the Banana Tapioca Pudding. So. Delicious. It was warm and sweet, and the perfect end to a filling meal. I left the restaurant stuffed beyond all belief, but happily so! We might have gone a little overboard, but whatever--when food is that good, you shouldn't think about the uncomfortable fullness that comes after. The next time I'm back, I want to try the Vietnamese coffee. The table next to us had it after dinner and it looked delicious.",0.998,0.717,0.272,0.01,0.603063063063063

First off the place is a very cute, yes I said cute, restaurant that reminds me of an old fashioned home down by a river. We were seated on the second floor and the waitress was very nice. We ordered the pho and the steamed chicken dumplings in rice flour roll. The pho was incredible, hands down one of if not the best pho I've ever had with the broth being so intensely beefy with a nice herbal finish that exemplifies the perfect bowl of pho. The pho also had slices of beef that were just melt in your mouth tender. The dumplings on the other hand were a little flavorless and I would have preferred another bowl of pho. For he entree I ordered the filet with shrimp on tomato pilaf and salad. The beef and shrimp were cooked perfectly and the rice was a perfect mix with the proteins in the dish. The salad was a little bit too sweet for me and I found the sweetness to be almost overpowering of the other flavors on the plate. But everything else on that plate was divine. Overall I'd definitely come back to get more of that pho and the rest of the entree minus the salad.",0.9919,0.787,0.19,0.023,0.5707818930041152

They made them veggie for us. There may have been too many carrots for my liking. You do get 4 rolls, which is quite a bit. For dinner, I had the lemongrass tofu, which was actually entree where they substituted the chicken with tofu for me. Appreciate the flexibility there. It was good. Comes with portabella mushrooms. Overall good flavors. We also had another dish with rice noodles and vegetables. Also really good. The service was a little slow - I expected better from a ""high-end"" place.

For our entrees: #31: chicken, eggplant, yam and mango in a coconut curry sauce served over rice. #41: lemongrass chicken with a chili lime sauce. #49: rice noodles with veggies in a garlic chili sauce with chicken.

The manager was there and was telling his staff members that he ""didn't have all day"" when his co worker asked if he had taken our order. They asked if we were ready once & we said we weren't.

From the minute you walk in, the hostess could not have been more welcoming and pleasant.  The servers and those supporting the servers top notch.  The ambiance, tasteful and an otherwise authentic representation of the colonial Asian period and influence.  More than adequate wine list and large offering of unique, atypical menu items for a restaurant that caters primarily to the local empty nester, out of towner and suburban weekend night out and date night crowd.  Prices were not unreasonable for the Gold Coast area, 6 drinks, 2 appetizers, three mains, two desserts and 3 coffees for about $60 person incl tip. Soo..what up?  The food, while not bad, caters to its above described clientele and has necessarily sacrificed some of its authenticity as many high end ethnic restaurants in the tourist zones have and need to do. I also understand that having worked in Vietnam for sometime and dining at some to their best restaurants also makes me an atypical reviewer.

Seeing this receipt made me curious: of all the times I had ordered carry out, the host had never once asked for my name. Next to Sarah's receipt, I found my order receipt on the table and checked for my name. Instead of my name, I found that he had just typed the word ""CHINA"". I was angry and shocked. Yes, I look Asian but I am not from China and my name is NOT ""CHINA"". I realized he never asked for my name because to him, I was just another one of the Chinese tourists walking around downtown Chicago. It seems I did not deserve my own name, despite being a regular customer that visited their establishment multiple times a week. I have to say I found this outrageous behavior very rude. They did not even care that I could see what they typed on the order receipt. I will never go back this restaurant.

Yes, it's great for a romantic evening out, but I'm not sure that the food would keep me coming back now that I've experienced it once. To start we ordered the Banh Cuon, which was good, although might need a sauce to go with it. For my main course I chose Bo Sate, which very tender filet mignon in sate spices with yams and green beans and very delicious. This dish was certainly the star of the night. My boyfriend got the Ca Hap, or Chilean sea bass, and we were not wild about it. For a side we opted for the Ca Tim Nuong, which was grilled japanese eggplant. I thought this was a great side, although it might have been a little too grilled for our tastes. The best way I can sum up Le Colonial is that I wouldn't go back.

Of course we had my favorite fresh spring rolls, with shrimp. It was served with a peanut sauce which was alright. Liked the bite-size pieces the rolls were cut in since usually these things are not so easy to eat, which is of particular concern when you're at a white-table-cloth Vietnamese restaurant. We also had ravioli with chicken which was delicious. For drinks we had sangria with lychee. Might seem like a strange choice but with all the salty flavors I think it does actually make sense.

When I saw they were participating in Restaurant Week at three courses for $22, I was on board. Fortunately, I was blown away by the experience and the purpose of Restaurant Week was actually achieved! First things first, the interior is stunning. The decor feels plucked right out of an old photograph. The food was delightful, fresh, flavorful, and fragrant as Vietnamese food should be, but there were interesting finesses that I'll have to explain by the French influence. Highly recommend the vegetarian curry and the banana wonton dessert. Service was impeccable, which makes the difference. I'll keep going to Argyle for my Viet fix because the food for the money is unbeatable (except maybe in Vietnam), but I'll definitely come back to Le Colonial for a special occasion.",0.9789,0.843,0.147,0.009,0.47441102756892234
2014-02-04,4.0,"Most Asians bristle at the idea of fancy, expensive Asian restaurants - because, let's face it: really good, authentic Asian food should cost you next to nothing. By way of comparison, the entrees at Tank Noodle (up in Argyle) are around $10 or less, and food in Chinatown will be similarly priced. Since I firmly subscribe to that philosophy, I avoided Le Colonial for years. But I finally went for a lunch during restaurant week, figuring that a $22 bill for 3 courses was an acceptable price for me to see what all the hype was about. Luckily, since I went in a group of 3, we managed to order all the options on the menu (literally, everything!): First Course: - Bo Bia (veggie rolls in rice paper) - your typical rice paper rolls (they were good) - Banh Cuon (""vietnamese ravioli of chicken & mushrooms"") - these were a little hard to separate (the rice noodle/paper kept tearing), but otherwise good? not too memorable - Sup Ga (chicken soup) - my personal favorite of the appetizers! more viscous than traditional American chicken soup though, so be warned about the texture Second Course: - Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio (BBQ Pork over noodles) - my (close) second favorite: the lime garlic fish sauce made everything very refreshing - Com Chien (fried rice; we chose the satay) - the satay was a bit dry, but the fried rice was otherwise delicious! my favorite from the entrees - Tau Hu Cari (Veggies in a Coconut Curry) - strongly reminded me of thai curry: a slight spice to it, and the veggies were cooked well Third Course: - Gourmet Ice Creams - you're at a French-Vietnamese restaurant, and you want ... pre-packaged Ciao Bella (that you can buy at the supermarket)? Try again. - Crispy Banana Wonton - a moist, cooked banana inside a crispy wonton, served on a plate of sauce & chocolate drizzle. Wasn't a huge fan of the spider-web-like drizzle design, but it was delicious. Other thoughts? + Ingredients all tasted very fresh + Decor & ambiance are both very nice - as was the service (our waiter was cheerful and friendly) + Portion sizes were enormous (especially for a restaurant participating in restaurant week) Bottom Line: The premium prices at Le Colonial mean added comfort (ambiance, decor, setting, service) as compared with a typical Vietnamese restaurant. So for those to whom comfort matters, Le Colonial will probably be the best thing ever. As for me, I really enjoyed my experience at Le Colonial, and would maybe consider going back for another lunch prix fixe / special occasion. But for every day food, I'll probably seek the greater bang for my buck that I can get elsewhere. (I'd feel too guilty not to!)",0.9967,0.808,0.162,0.03,0.5890542328042327

2014-02-03,3.0,"Another restaurant week choice, but this time I did a lunch.  Lunch is a great deal, and I'm going to have to do more of them.  For $22 you get a full 3-course meal.  My sister got the restaurant week menu and had the spring rolls and coconut curry vegetables.  I didn't try the spring rolls, but the coconut curry was good.  The veggies were well cooked and the coconut curry was really flavorful.  Sadly, the sauce was watery and didn't coat the veggies or the rice very well because of its consistency. I ordered from the regular menu because I can't go to a vietnamese restaurant and not order pho.  I was shocked they didn't offer the pho on the restaurant week menu.  The pho was good, flavorful and had a lot of noodles.  There were only 3 pieces of beef, and while they looked overcooked, they were tender and well seasoned.  Overall, it was good, but the bowl was far too small for my taste.  A bowl of pho is supposed to be massive and cheap.  This bowl was just not the big bowl that I'm used to, and for $7.50 there should have been more meat.  I also ordered the fried rice and this was delicious.  The chicken was tender and moist and the rice was perfectly cooked, although again a bit skimpy on the meat.  Nothing was greasy or oily, it was all perfectly seasoned for a fried rice.  My little sister got the vanilla ice cream for dessert, and it was good, but nothing noteworthy.  The other option was a banana wonton. I have to agree with some of the other reviews, the ambiance in the restaurant is great.  The decor really took me to a tropical location.  However, maybe because I was there during the day, maybe because I was seated by the bright lights coming in the window, but all of the waitors and staff seemed just a little unkept.  The whites weren't white, the pants had stains.  Just little things that I seemed to notice that put me off.  Service itself was good, nothing stood out as being great or bad about the service. Overall, I love vietnamese food, especially pho and I haven't been to any vietnamese restaurants in chicago, so I give it a 3.  I'll go back, but likely only for lunch.  It did inspire me to go find some great, cheap pho in the city!",0.9977,0.788,0.186,0.026,0.5731908831908832

2014-01-30,2.0,"I am Vietnamese. So when I moved to Chicago and heard about a nice restaurant with Vietnamese food, I was naturally curious and looked for an excuse to take my fiance here.  Based on reviews/description, I thought Le Colonial would use really really good ingredients and classic French techniques to elevate traditional Vietnamese food, or offer a fresh/modern take on the classics with caring and eloquent service.  Instead, it gave me watered-down, less flavorful versions of many dishes I or my mother can make better, for about eight times the price you would pay up in Argyle Street, with service I can only describe as untrustworthy. Good news first: the ambiance is quite incredible.  Soft candlelight and sconces, some crowding of tables but no NYC-level awfulness, potted palms and slow ceiling fans create an intimate and beautiful vibe.  One of the hosts offered to take our coats but the other one interrupted her and took care of us instead: awkward. I should've known looking around: the only asian people were in large groups of  business dinners.  But we gave it the benefit of the doubt.  We ordered wonderful cocktails (the lychee sangria was the essence of lychee, with a bit of mango in there.  My Le Botanique was a nice herbal bitters-heavy gin mix with mint and lime, a touch darker than expected).  When I asked our server what was in my drink (I was surprised by the color) and she started stumbling ""mmm pomegranate syrup I think, and... I'll go ask.""  No pomegranate syrup, and I appreciate her coming back to tell me, but at this price point I expect extremely good service: I want my servers to know the menu and drinks very, very well, as if they care about the product. Onward to food.  I ordered off the restaurant week menu, he ordered off the regular menu. Note: the toxin to our entire dining experience were the dry rice noodles.  They were brittle, dry, and extremely sticky.  I didn't even know there was such a thing as bad rice noodles until the night I ate here. GOI CUON (summer rolls): why would you pay $11 for two tiny rolls that lack flavor?  Go to Lotus Cafe for six of these for $6 which are slightly better.  The plum sauce was disappointing, the noodles were terrible, and there wasn't enough mint.  I appreciated the inclusion of bean sprouts for the textural effect, but these were watered-down in flavor and sadly dried out in texture. PHO (oxtail noodle soup): pleasantly surprised by the lightness and clearness of this soup.  A few good pieces of beef with lots of those infamous noodles, and a small handful of mint/basil.  Served with plum sauce/sriracha, which the server explained to me.  Was it tasty?  Sure.  Was it good pho?  That's arguable.  Pho is an unexpected soup, with the star anise adding a sweet-spicy something and the daikon root/carrots leveling the broth.  This was a yummy if plain bowl of soup.  Could've used some of those spicy leaves/bean sprouts/more lime generally served with pho.  Note: you can get about three times this amount (enough for a meal, and then one to take home) for around the same price at Tank Noodle. SUP DO BIEN (Vietnamese bouillabaisse): I've just returned from a trip to Marseille where I've had wonderful bouillabaisse twice, so when I saw this on the menu I was quite intrigued.  DELICIOUS.  I loved this dish!  This dish is why there are two stars instead of one.  At $33 it's pricey, but good bouillabaisse in Marseille (where the dish originates) will run you about 50 euro, so this is quite reasonable.  The soup has wonderful notes of saffron and the heady creaminess of coconut milk tempering the rich broth made of a lot of seafood.  The bowl is packed with white fish, scallops, shrimp, lobster, mussels, all of which are delicately, perfectly cooked.  Served with a plate of basil, cabbage, and a brick of those awful noodles.  We tried to put the noodles in and eat them, but they stuck in our mouths and didn't capture the flavor.  TIP: PUT IN THE CABBAGE AND TREAT IT LIKE NOODLES.  Cabbage captures a lot of broth, it wilts a bit into a lovely texture, and the homeliness of cabbage balances the rich seafood broth.   CA NUONG LA CHUOI (roasted trout in banana leaf, topped with vermicelli and mushrooms): my mom makes this dish a lot, sans banana leaf.  The flavors didn't sparkle (I mean it was quite plain) until I poured on the ""curry sauce,"" which tastes exactly like a Thai peanut satay sauce.  He enjoyed this.  It may come in family style?  I wasn't sure how to eat it. MANGO SUNDAE/COCONUT MACAROON: I liked the sundae a lot.  Very mango-ey.  The macaroon was both brittle and chewy and we expected a shell?  With chocolate?   More on service: I think I scared our server when I ordered and pronounced the words as they are in Vietnamese.  She explained the dishes to my fiance and decided to not do so to me.  Leaving and getting our coats was confusing.  This whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth.",0.9985,0.773,0.16,0.067,0.5858031851550369

2014-01-22,4.0,"I've been to LeColonial 3 times, each time for lunch, and every time left more than satisfied. First off, it's not cheap but it's not profusely expensive either. For 2 people for lunch, without any alcoholic drinks, it'll run around $50. I have to say as far as decor and ambiance, this is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. I really love the old Vietnam look/feel it has to it. From chairs made of wicker, colonial style white paneling, slowly spinning ceiling fans to even the plants ... once you step through the gates of the front doors you've stepped into another time. To make matters better, there is an upstairs that is equally if not more impressive, featuring a very cool and unique bar setting (with sitting area) that is a refreshingly deviant setting from the surrounding fish-and-chops heavy restaurants in the neighborhood. People do dress well here, so don't be caught off guard, but if you show up in nice jeans and a button down you should be fine. It's also worth noting that while I've never found it on any sort of 'romantic restaurants' list and I've never been for dinner service, while passing by many times I've thought it is definitely more list-worthy than many commonly listed places. On to the food! Le Colonial is a French-Vietnamese restaurant. To the untrained eater, it may seem ""kind of like thai"". There are definitely many overlapping points but the main nuance I found was the level of spice and some of the other techniques employed here. This isn't a thai restaurant, in other words, but if you do enjoy those flavors you won't be disappointed here.  Over my numerous visits I've had a number of items, all of which were quite good. Here were some of my favorites: CHAO TOM This is shrimp wrapped around sugar cane, and comes with vermicelli noodles and a plum dipping sauce. Probably the most memorable dish I've had here as the shrimp takes on this interesting almost smoky taste and afterwards you can suck on the sugar cane just for the flavor. SUP GA This is a simple yet delicious soup of chicken and baby corn, finished with cilantro. It almost reminded me of a mulligatawny if memory serves. PHO I know this isn't Argyle so there couldn't possibly be good Pho right? I disagree. This is a great soup and actually very filling. After eating this I just remember thinking how the heck am I going to eat my entree?! Great value. CA NUONG LA CHUOI A trout smoked with 2 types of mushrooms and noodles in a banana leaf. You had me at banana leaf! And they give you a side of a tasty creamy curry sauce to spoon over each bite as you go along. Delicious ... I'm drooling for this as I reminisce :) GA XAO CARI Chicken with eggplant and some other veggies with a yellow curry sauce. Very good, but I prefer the Ca Nuong La Chuoi still I think. This particular dish has a vegetarian version with tofu I believe too so, vegetarians enjoy :) The portions are pretty perfect for an average person, so you don't really need an appetizer for lunch, but maybe for dinner if you're particularly hungry but you can share one. Overall this is a great spot with amazing ambiance, and food that will leave you smiling on your way back out into the present day world.",0.9992,0.769,0.212,0.019,0.5774276377217555

Drinks were good, ambience was great, but after 25 minutes we went to check on the table and the hostess said another few mins.  After another 5 mins the hostess came to us and told us the table would be another 25 mins so they had a smaller makeshift table in the corner of the lounge.  At that point we took it because we were so hungry.  They sent a complimentary appetizer our way which was delicious.  It was my first time there, the waitress just came to us and asked if we are ready to order I asked her to recommend something and she said everything was good.  Our drinks were super delayed.  I am glad our friends had been there and recommended some dishes they had.  However I would definitely come back because the downstairs looked so nice and intimate, and the food was very very good.  The flavors came together perfectly.  Other than service Le Colonial was amazing, I will definitely go back, but back sure you sit in the main dining hall!",0.9968,0.704,0.268,0.028,0.567088888888889

I can get the same quality and taste in Vietnamese food from the little hole in the wall Vietnamese restaurant in my hometown in California for 1/4 the price. I'm not sure if it's just that Vietnamese food is much more rare here in Chicago than it is in California or what, but I was quite underwhelmed with the food considering its cost. I also was a little disappointed with the fact that none of the food had any French flair. Since it advertises itself as being a French-Vietnamese restaurant, I thought Le Colonial would have more creativity to its dishes. Instead, I found the dish I ordered (#41) was simply lemongrass chicken and the dish my boyfriend ordered (#28) was pretty much just Peking duck. I would come back for a drink at the bar or if someone else was picking up the tab, but for $50 a person including tax and tip (we shared one appetizer and had one drink each), I don't think I'd recommend the place to people for dinner in general.",0.9876,0.806,0.168,0.026,0.5827513227513227

2013-08-19,2.0,"Le Colonial was a restaurant I was highly looking forward to; I love French and Asian cuisines, it's higher end but not too pricey, and friends of mine are regulars and highly recommend it. However, overpriced bottom-shelf cocktails and HORRIBLE service will keep me from this place permanently. If you'd like to know why, just skip to the 5th paragraph. The taste of the food wins back a star. First of all, we couldn't get a reservation until much later than desired, but a quick call to American Express concierge changed that. Upon arriving to the restaurant, they had trouble finding the reservation, which turned out to be for sometime in September. American Express sent an email confirmation, but the staff put it in incorrectly. Thankfully, they quickly found us a table along the wall downstairs. Things go downhill from there. The tables are all crammed in so they have to be moved for ingress/egress; good for a tiny person, bad for claustrophobic individuals. Prices are as to be expected, but somehow the menu has no French flair that I can see. All dishes are in Vietnamese, but we all like Asian, so no worry. We look at the drink menu, and it's honestly pathetic. I love a good vodka-based cocktail, but even as a college student I drink better than SKYY. Seriously, $13 for a SKYY vodka cocktail? HIgh end clubs and bars and better restaurants charge $11-16 for Belvedere, Grey Goose, or at least Effen. Next thing I know, the lights are dimmed about 40% making it almost impossible to read the menus without straining. After whipping out bright iPhone LED flashlight apps and irritating our neighbors, I kindly asked the manager if he could turn the lights back up, to which he laughed and replied, ""Uhhh no there's nothing I can do about it."" But then decided adding more candles would help (which it doesn't). I asked again when he came to the table, and he very snarkily replied, ""It's better, more romantic."" Nothing more romantic than blinding your neighbors. I'm in a bad mood, but looking forward to good food. We ordered an appetizer and several varying entrees. Appetizer was delicious, one entree was very good but a bit complicated, the second was just average, but mine was almost inedible. I had the #25 shredded pork dish. I will note that the pork was excellently-flavored and the accompanying spinach and other vegetables were crisp and fresh; the vermicelli was good, too. Unfortunately, the pork was disgusting. The pork on top was warm, while down below it was ice cold (obviously sat under a heating element for a while). It was incredibly gristly. It was shredded and held together by fat; we ended up using teamwork to separate the fat. I can eat a lot, but I had to stop and just ate the fluffy rice. I took the veggies home and look forward to eating the vegetables and noodles. A true French chef would never let something so revolting leave his kitchen. **I actually just checked the photos of the food tonight, and I genuinely did not know the vegetables in my entree were of such varying colors. It was so dark all I saw was shapely darkness on my plate... Soon before finishing the meal, the young lady in the adjacent booth passed out, and we of course helped her and called 911. A table was moved and she was on the floor recovering, and everyone in the restaurant was asking us if she was alright. Thankfully it is unlikely anything serious, but the manager did not take kindly to the situation at all. One of the many busboys was helping out, but the manager didn't seem to care. In fact, I heard him mutter something along the lines of ""They'd better pay and tip well; they've ruined our seating for the night."" WOW. I was floored.  After waiting quite a while for the check, I absolutely refused to tip and wrote many notes on the back of the receipt. First of all, I wouldn't know who to tip because none of the servers/busboys/waiters introduced themselves, and we had at least 10 different people attending to us; the service was highly impersonal. Upon leaving, I requested my friends wait outside while I speak with the manager. The manager was incredibly nonchalant about my concerns, and denied his attitude and his comments. He laughed a bit, genuinely not caring about our horrible experience. If the owner of Le Colonial happens upon this, I would LOVE to speak with you about the matter. I thought I'd regularly be coming here, but never again, and my friends who come weekly are strongly reconsidering it as their lunchtime place.",0.9974,0.735,0.171,0.094,0.4864646873594242

First, I was welcomed in with open arms and the service was incredibly warm and attentive. I ordered the shrimp Banh Pho Xiao (rice noodles sauteed with soy, sprouts, shallots, red pepper and garlic chili sauce). Wow. Completely satisfied my noodle craving.

2013-08-17,5.0,"I dined here with my father this week. Our server was Liz, she was excellent and took very good care of us! I've dined in many upscale restaurants over the years and I hate when serves act as though you don't belong there or look down on you because you are unsure how to pronounce some of the menu items. This was not the case with Liz or any of the other people who helped us during our visit.  We sat out on patio outside since it was a nice evening. The inside of the restaurant is beautiful however, and I would very much like to come back and eat in there. We shared the tuna tartar and monkfish apps. Both delicious. I could probably have just ordered more of the tartar and had that as my meal. My dad got the red snapper and I had the stir-fried shrimp, scallops, and calamari over egg noodles. Both delicious. The red snapper was the better of the two and next time I will likely order that, it was delicious!  Neither of us had any alcoholic beverages since my dad does not drink. However we both ordered hot tea which was enjoyable. I know many restaurants and servers prefer their patrons to order alcohol since it is an easy mark-up on bills. As I noted my dad does not drink so that is why we both had tea instead. I've been served at some places where I feel as though servers are annoyed with us due to us not having some type of drink. This is always uncomfortable, once again I felt that the servers here were very attentive despite us not ordering more upscale drinks and continually brought us hot water and fresh tea. Additionally, Liz brought us out a delicious macaroon and ice cream dessert, which was the perfect way to end the evening.

2013-07-14,2.0,"I was really looking forward to our first trip to Le Colonial, but I was quite disappointed. It was an expensive meal with consistently bad service in a restaurant that seemed to have no air conditioning in the middle of July. We had dinner reservations for 8:15 and the hostess seated us at a table upstairs where we just sat and waited until eventually we flagged down the hostess again to ask if she might give us menus to look at. Although a waitress did ask us what kind of water we wanted, she never came back to take our drink orders or food orders even though we seemed to be sitting in the middle of her station. Eventually the hostess saw us just sitting there waiting again and offered to take our order. I ordered the bun thit nuong - bbq pork - and was surprised to find that half of the plate was covered in lettuce - sort of a salad without dressing - with very little pork. We had to wait again for someone to notice that we might like to order dessert even though the restaurant was not very busy by that time. And when the dessert arrived, it came without silverware. After we ate our dessert, one of the servers mistakenly set someone else's dessert on our table until we explained that we had just had dessert - that he had the wrong table.

2013-03-22,4.0,"Man another week of prix fixe menus rolled around so quickly.  Initially, upon dining at Le Colonial, I thought that it was a French Vietnamese fusion restaurant.   This prompted me to do a little research since I had seen this them at another restaurant.  Soon I learned that Vietnam was a colony of France from 1887 to 1954.  That length of time in control of the country would explain the french influence on the Vietnamese dishes. Walking into Le Colonial, you would initially feel like you are transported into a French Bistro in the early 1900's. The romantic atmosphere is heightened by dim lighting and mellow jazz.  It is a quaint white tablecloth sort of place that is well decorated from the ornate red ceiling with very elaborate dark brown molding bordering it.  The vintage theme is further achieved via black and white photos dotted throughout the establishment.  The place does gain a bit of stuffiness by virtue of the fact that the servers are all wearing jackets. I have an affinity for lychees.  They are one of my favorite fruits.  Naturally when I saw a Lychee Sangria offered on the menu I had to order it.  The drink was very tasty.  It was made with a moscato but some how didn't come off as too sweet. and the cinnamon was a nice touch.  The downside of the drink is it had waaaaay too much ice.  I felt like I was in a drive through or something honestly.  I wasn't offered another drink which saved me some money in  then in probably because it looked as though my drink was still near full because of the overwhelming amount of ice. The spring rolls were perfectly fried.  Frying can be difficult to pull off but these spring rolls were crispy on the outside and not greasy.  They were very light and refreshing as well.  It was served with lettuce, to wrap the spring rolls in with your choice of accompaniments.  The light slightly pickled cucumber and mint cilantro in the wraps, mean you could have total control over the intensity of those vegetal and herbaceous tastes. The best part of my visit here was listening to the guy two tables over describe his encounter with the ghost that is haunting his apartment.  Apparently it's some lady that was killed in the early 1900's.  I don't believe in ghosts, but this guy sounded really convinced.  Eating alone you rarely get the entertainment of an interesting conversation going on two tables over. The pho was quite divine.  I ordered it in addition because I'm a huge fan of pho.  What I wasn't expecting was the huge portions of beef that was included with it.  It has to be the best value on the menu there.  The beef was very tender but a little cumbersome to eat with the large chunks it was left in.  Still overall as a dish it is pretty satisfying. I went with the seafood stir fry for my main it it was a dish that delivers nearly everything from the ocean.  Fresh tender sweet scallops, calamari and shrimp.  It was combined with broccoli, onions, mushrooms  snow peas and green beans.What made this dish unique that it was served over pan fried egg noodles.  This made for an interesting difference in texture as the noodles around the edge of the plate which were not under the rest of the stir fry kept a really crisp texture while the noodles under the stir fry had absorbed some of the very garlic and oyster sauce to get this nice chewy texture.",0.9973,0.816,0.148,0.036,0.4916836734693877

2013-03-17,4.0,"Can't find another better place to kick off my long list of sampling plan for the Chef week. Le Colonial has been on my hit list for quite while. Finally, I was able to find a partner in crime to enjoy this French Vietnamese fine dining on a sunny Sunday afternoon.  Of course one will not be disappointed by the ambient and architectural/ interior design. It gives one the sense of slowing down especially among the different shops and establishments on the heavily commercialized Rush street. My lunch started with Bo Bia, a soft rice roll with bundles of veggies. Considering a balanced protein meal, thin sliced BBQ pork over angle hair rice and veggies noodle was my choice of main course. Surprises came when it was served. I was not expecting how fresh the veggies were. Besides that, the lightly hinted fish sauce reminded one the exotic tropical country but without an overwhelming intense sauce aroma. I confessed that I failed to  resist the temptation of my friend's entree, sautéed diced chicken with eggplant, mango, yam, etc. Who would know all of these can come together so seamlessly. Yes. And the dessert was worth of a real photographic moment.  Delightful Sunday lunch after St Patty's Celebration on Saturday.

The old school host greets you from his desk, leads you to your seat, pulls out the table, escorts the lady...the entire deal. Very pleasant. From there the service was attentive, quick, not overbearing and friendly.  I  had some jasmine tea which was excellent and enjoyed the ambiance...French restaurant meets the tropical climate of Thailand. There was trees and nice decor throughout. We came in for lunch ( a very decent crowd there, but only the front end of the dining room was open) and started with the spring rolls. The peanut sauce was some of the best I've ever had.  From there, the Pho was a good sized portion, came with two different dipping sauces and was tasty. I would've loved to see some bean sprouts, fresh mint and peppers on the side, but the beef tenderloin inside the pho made me forget that gripe in an instant. It was very juicy, tender and delicious. Most traditional pho I've had, the beef tends to be cut much thinner, but the slightly thicker cut meat was delicious. I also have to mention that I loved the chopsticks! Sounds like a little thing, but I hate those heavy, plastic ones used at nicer restaurants, and it was nice not to have to compromise for a cheapo pair of wooden ones. My boyfriend and I also split the Goi Bo salad which was beef, lemongrass, chili, basil and a chili garlic vinaigrette. The salad was nice, light, a good portion and the perfect complement to our lunch.

The dessert was my least favorite.  What I received was not really a macaroon, and it was definitely not what was described on their menu. When I think of macaroons, the first word that comes to mind is ""light"".  I would describe what I got as more of a dense coconut-flavored bread pudding with ice cream on top. It tasted fine, but it just wasn't what I was expecting to get. Service was very good up until the end.  The lapse of time between our main and the dessert was about 40 min.  It wasn't a huge deal because I was with good friends and the conversation flowed easily, but we did all notice that it was taking a long time for the end of our meal to come out.

For my entree, I ordered the Vit Quay (ginger-marinated roasted duck). It was excellent, although I would have liked to have had some greens on the plate. For cocktails, I had the Mekong Sunset, which was good although a bit watered down.

The service and decor are always topnotch.  When the weather is nice their second floor balcony is a great place for enjoying a delicious dinner outside without sitting right next to the street.  Of course, in those months you can't sit outside to eat (and there are plenty in Chicago) the dinning room is gorgeous and comfortable.

Even worse, we spent the whole evening unable to escape the arguing and crying of the couple on a date at the table next to us. The service and food, on the other hand, were definite positives. I had the tuna tartare and red snapper and they were both fresh, light, and delicious.

It's not everyday we drop $125 for a meal, so we thought anniversary dinner would be just a perfect occasion to finally give it a try.  We made a reservation for a Friday night, past 7 only few tables were taken. We got seated upstairs and the atmosphere was just lovely. Palm and banana plants, soft lighting and creme walls with dark wood accents got us reminiscing about time spend in Vietnam and were a promising start to the evening. Strong, tasty drinks kept the ball rolling.  Goi Ngo Sen - lotus root & tofu salad with cucumbers, tomatoes, & chili lime soy dressing - was light and refreshing. Tom Cuon Ram - crisp beignets stuffed with shrimp, chicken, & vegetables, served with orange ginger dipping sauce - were good, but nothing spectacular. The ball dropped entirely when our entries arrived. Ca Nuong La Chuoit - grilled trout served steamed in a banana leaf - was dry and tasted as if reheated. Noodles it came with were all soggy. Vit Quay - ginger marinated roasted duck was on a dry side and had skin that was anything but crispy, barely browned. When I called for our waitress and asked her about it, she stiffly replied ""This is the way we make it"", left me speechless and walked away. Nice, right? Our table was rather tiny and we had to stash away cumbersome menus ourselves because the waitress couldn't care less about how uncomfortable we were. To top it off,  we had to refill our own water glasses, and nobody bothered to ask how our meal was, except at the end, when they cleared the table and offered a dessert menu. Really? In a restaurant of this caliber?  Needless to say, we skipped desert and left with a bitter aftertaste. This was by far the worst dining experience we ever had.

It has been my experience that over an extended period of time restaurants can get tired, concepts lose their freshness, food gets boring and service gets perfunctory.

2012-10-29,3.0,"Long before Wolfgang Puck's global celebrity inspired a myriad of knockoffs, and ubiquitous Korean taco joints, Le Colonial was all the city had for fusion cuisine. As with all pioneer establishments, it's important to distinguish between those places that open the door for superior iterations of a concept, and those that are truly revolutionary. Judging by my experience, Le Colonial unfortunately falls into the former category.  The idea is simple enough: the French took over Vietnam, and the cuisines legitimately have influenced one another, so why not fuse the two? I was expecting a nice interplay of exotic ingredients and French technique; alas, this menu is better characterized as ""compartmentalization"" rather than ""fusion"". Cha Gio ($10) are basically just regular eggrolls, with lettuce leaves to superfluously wrap them in. They're pretty good, but not special considering they are $2 each. Banh Cuon ($10), chicken and mushroom dumplings, are certainly interesting in flavor, but are virtually impossible to eat without falling apart. Pho ($7) shines among appetizers (and in my opinion, all dishes here) - the beef tenderloin is a welcome indulgence, and the soup is very piquant and balanced after adding the supplemental sauces. Still, $7 worth of Pho feeds 3 people in little Saigon, but not here.  Ca Nuong La Choi ($25) is a subtle and well-executed dish - trout and vermicelli noodles steamed in a banana leaf, served with a peanutty curry sauce on the side. Is it any better than standard Asian steamed whole fish, with sauce on the side? Doubt it. Bun Thit Nuong ($21) is one of the stronger entrees in terms of flavor - rich barbecued pork served with a melange of mostly raw vegetables. The issue here is that it's unclear how to eat everything together without getting messy/unpleasant. Vit Quay ($23) is nothing special - slightly overcooked but pleasant roast duck served with a decent tamarind sauce. Not bad, but again, where's the French twist?? After sampling a decent portion of the menu, I have to conclude that there is little in the culinary domain that sets Le Colonial's savory offerings apart from standard Vietnamese fare. The desserts, which we didn't order, are mostly French - I guess their idea of fusion is Vietnamese food with French desserts. Furthermore, there is no justification for paying double what you'd ordinarily pay for this kind of Vietnamese food - the decor is nice, I guess, but that's not enough for me. All in all, Le Colonial does little in the way of interesting juxtaposition of its purported culinary influences - it just places them side by side and expects us to be enthralled. To me, it looks like fusion cuisine's evolution into food trucks and fast dining is a welcome development.",0.9876,0.821,0.125,0.054,0.4885780885780886

Fortunately, Le Colonial delivered a pretty good meal, even though it wasn't necessarily worth the prices we paid. My friend took me and my other friend here while I was home for a week because it's one of her favourite restaurants. The inside of the restaurant is very old school fine dining, with dark wood tables, white table cloths, and servers buttoned up all the way. Per my friend's recommendation I went with the goi bun so (sea scallop salad) and the oxtail pho. Both of them were very good. The pho was an interesting take on the traditional Vietnamese dish -- while it had all the elements of a hearty bowl of pho, the seasoning was definitely more refined and unique in many ways. The salad was light but filling at the same time. The scallops were a little overcooked and rubbery, but the noodles were delicious. We also split an order of egg rolls, which, while good, were not worth $2 each. I'm not sure I would recommend this restaurant, because I still firmly believe that the best pho is made by Korean people in tiny hole-in-the-wall restaurants with C restaurant inspection ratings, but it's an interesting experience if you're craving Vietnamese food and aren't drunk enough to put up with dirty tables and absent servers who don't speak English.",0.9709,0.814,0.135,0.051,0.5266329966329967

We sat upstairs on the balcony on a beautiful night and I must admit the space was beautiful.  Inside was a little dirty and even a little tired (the fake plants were bizarre to me) but overall not bad.   The standout of the evening were the specialty cocktails.  Yes, they're $14 each but they're huge and delicious.   Overall an ok experience but you're definitely paying for location and ambiance.  If you've never had Vietnamese the food will probably be ok.  If you're into Asian fare and don't care about 'scene' I advise you go somewhere else.",0.9888,0.677,0.242,0.081,0.586231884057971

One of the bar tenders was easy on the eye, and that never hurts.  We started with the pho, which was very good, but the main courses were just average. I ordered the Mi Axo Do Bien and my dad got the Bo Bitet Tom Nuong. Mine was decent at best. It was a good portion, but I thought the flavor was too mild and it took away from the freshness of the seafood. The noodles were a weird crunchy texture that I didn't care for either. My dad's was much better, but not what he remembered from 20 years ago. I think my favorite part of his was the rice. It was like a tomato based sauce with pineapple and a flavor I've never had before. Apparently it's the only dish on the menu with it, but next time I might ask for a side.  Even though it was way overpriced, I would go back for the soup and to try the lettuce wraps. I'm just not in any hurry.",0.9717,0.819,0.146,0.035,0.5875438596491228
2012-09-09,3.0,"Le Colonial had been on our list for 3 years, so maybe it was the build-up in our minds that led to my general disappointment. Ambience.... Was great, but (in addition to the wine prices) was probably the only thing ""french"" about our experience. It looked ike a cute little french restaurant, and I liked the experience of walking in. Service.... was mediocre. I was initally impressed that we were offered a vegetarian menu. However, we were sat out on a balcony with a huge draft, and I was shivering visibly. I asked to move to a warmer table, and they moved us to a table just one row in from the edge of the balcony. After appetizers, it started pouring, and we had to ask to be moved inside, though the rain was making its way in edgewise! Lastly, one of our entrees was cold when it got to our table. After all of the commotion to get to our mains, that was unacceptable. Our new waitress inside was gracious about it, which was nice. Food... was also mediocre, and not worth the money. As a vegetarian in 2012, I expect to go to a top-rated restaurant and be offered more than two versions of spring rolls (a crispy and a soft) and what amounts to 3 versions of tofu stir fry (one over noodles). Really? Sadly, everything we ordered I felt like I could get at one of the better places up on Argyle, if not a pan-Asian chain like Stir Crazy. We ordered the soft spring rolls, which came with a disappointingly uninventive chilli peanut sauce. We got the chilli tofu over wide rice noodles and the lemongrass tofu with portobello. I couldn't see any of the colonial influence in the food, either. Tasted like generic Asian food to me. Our desserts were also blah. There was one item on the menu that looked interesting, with bananas and tapioca. But everything else could have been the dessert menu anywhere. The ""gourmet ice creams"" on the menu were two scoop sof Ciao Bella for $7... those are available at the Jewel now. Gourmet? Really? Also, isn't gelato Italian? We got a creme brulee and a lemon tart. They were both average. Overall, this restaurant seems to lack focus on its core appeal, the French-Vietnamese. They need to find a way to be more inventive, and offer an experience that is both French AND Vietnamese, not one where each part of it is either French OR Vietnamese. To make this place worth the money, they need to differentiate the uniqueness of the food against plain old vietnamese take out. Until then, I'll order vietnamese takeout for $20 online instead of spending $130 like we did last night.",0.9858,0.834,0.113,0.053,0.4736909915481344

It's the kind of place you'll return to, where you don't have to wait usually but a reservation is a good idea. It transports you to another era without seeming like a theme restaurant.

2012-08-17,4.0,"I'm not exactly a fan of the prices nor the slower-than-I'd-like-for-lunch service, but the food here is great! I love that I found a good place for Vietnamese food (home food to me) around my work place.  I like the bo luc lac (cubed steak) salad. It wasn't exactly what I thought it'd be (where was my rice?), but it was delicious nonetheless.  The pho is small in quantity, but honestly, this is the perfect serving size for me. I don't need a gigantic bowl of noodle soup. The quality of the beef was excellent. I do still like my pho dac biet (special pho w/ all the works) at cheaper, less elegant, hole-in-the-wall restaurants though.  I especially love the cha gio (summer egg rolls). They present it to you w/ lettuce, mints, cilantro, carrots and daikon garnishes and a small bowl of nuoc mam (fish sauce). Here's what you do: Wrap everything up in the lettuce and dip. Yum!  The gio cuon (spring rolls) were good too, but there's nothing special about them. The bun thit nuong (vermicelli with grilled pork) has good flavor. What I didn't like about this dish was that the noodles were cut... I am not a chopsticks novice, and I felt a bit offended that they presented it to me in this manner. I ended up having to use my fork to eat this plate of food, and it was strange for me.  Now, the food has been great so far, and I love it. I want to come here again and again to try the cari (curry) and the banh cuon and pretty much everything else. The weekday lunchtime service, though, could use some improvements... Please, please, please figure out which ones of your lunch time guests want to sit there forever and be served one course at a time over a time span of 2-3 hours. I am NOT one of these people. I work in the area and I only have one hour for lunch so speed it up and/or be attentive and notice me when I want your attention. I ended up overtipping my server one afternoon because I didn't care to get change. If I had asked for change, I'd have been over 10 minutes late returning back to my office thanks to the staff's ridiculously slow service. I even told my server, ""I want this wrapped. I need to go."" and ""No, I don't want the dessert menu. I need to go."" After two ""I need to go,"" he still doesn't bring me my check until 5 minutes later. Then he asks, ""Do you need change?"" when he saw me getting up to leave. ""No, I need to go."" Seriously? Pay attention. This is not acceptable to me, not at a restaurant where the prices are way more expensive than prices I'm used to in places like Argyle, not at an upscale restaurant decorated so elegantly and classy, etc.  Dinner service... Still a bit slow and inattentive, but I'm okay with this since I'm usually not in a rush to go anywhere afterwards.  Also, the business prix fixe lunch is cheaper (at $22.50 for an appetizer, a main entree, and coffee compared to getting each of these items individually), but it's too much food. I was surprised that they gave me four eggrolls (cha gio) for the appetizer followed by a good sized portion of the bun thit nuong. I didn't end up getting my coffee (just plain regular coffee, I'm told, not ca phe sua da / Vietnamese coffee) because I was in a rush to get out.  From now on, if I come here again for lunch, I'm ordering one item and one item only.",0.9986,0.789,0.177,0.034,0.5654914529914528

The spring rolls had a good ratio to noodles, vegetables and meat and seafood.

2012-08-03,5.0,"Woah! Hold up. Back up a second! I don't know what's happening. My pho experiences keep getting bettah and bettah. Like, seriously. I am in love with lil' Saigon Pho in Forest Park, but Le Colonial has me second guessing my loyalties because it just freakin' blew pho outta the ballpark! So, this is how I resolve that cognitive dissonance: Saigon Pho is good for around the corner fixes whereas Le Colonial is for when I want the high class experience. I've been to Le Colonial twice now - once for lunch and once for din din. The service was really exemplary both times: genuine, friendly, knowledgeable, attentive, timely, accurate. Our server for dinner explained that they have THREE WEEKS of training culminating with a written test! Now that's what's up! And they're so not stuck up. I mean, both times I visited Le Colonial I was under-dressed in walking shorts but I was treated with as much respectful attention as if I had a million bucks. I can't say that I was the biggest fan of the spring rolls (definitely superior at my darling Saigon Pho), but everything else was really lovely. This is what I've had and my thoughts on it: Pho (#11) - The serving was a regular size bowl of soup - not the traditionally overwhelming portion of pho. The garnishes (other than the sauces) were already incorporated into the soup. What really set this pho apart from any other kind I've had lies in the high quality of the meat. It was lean and easy to chew. Thom Cuan Ram (#9) - These were huge shrimp covered in a beignet. All of us were a HUGE fan of these lovelies and we all highly recommend them. They were light on the stomach but flavorful on the tongue. The textures ranged from crispy on the outside to soft on the inside. Goi Cuan (#2) - The spring rolls. Eh. I was surprised that there were shrimp in them. I think I would have liked them better without the shrimp. Maybe you'll like them with the shrimp, but I did not. I thought that the whole thing was just a flat note in my Le Colonial experience. The flavors weren't explosive (I depended heavily on the sauce) and the texture was monochromatic. My other dinner guests got an additional dish that was recommended by the server. They flipped over it, but I didn't try it and I don't remember what it was. Per our brilliant server's pearls of wisdom: we hope to visit many more times so that we can sample all of the delicious dishes from Le Colonial. Last point of order - the ambiance. It was most certainly upscale, but somehow upscale tropical. Like, imagine you're a raja on a tiled patio being fanned by beautiful women by huge palms. Le Colonial is like that. There were potted plants all over the place, dark wood, tiles, and open windows. There are two levels and lots of dining space; however, it's not noisy and maintains a sense of intimacy.

I requested to be seated upstairs by the front terrace (as others have recommended) and it truly was beautifully set up there. Very romantic ambiance, perfect for any special occasion. We also ordered the melon and passion martinis, which were very fruity - I especially liked the passion one. Men beware - the glasses are super girly, so if you don't want to be carrying that around from the bar to your table (like my boyfriend haha), but I suggest getting another one of their fabulous cocktail options. For our appetizer, we had the #15 salad (Bo Luc Lac) and it was AMAZING! Honestly, one of the best salads I had. The meat was very juicy, tender, and rather sweet. The dressing also complimented the filet very well. The greens were all very fresh tasting - the perfect combination of ingredients! For my entree, I got the #31 (Ga Xao Cari) which was very delicious. If you are an eggplant person and can handle spicy foods, I would definitely recommend this dish. I had no complaints and it really hit my sweet spot for good curry. My boyfriend got the #38 (Ca Nuong) which he raved about. I only tried a bit of the salmon, which was cooked to medium rare and was surprisingly sweeter than  I would have expected. He kept telling me how delicious it was and how he had to consciously pace himself to not eat all of the salmon in one huge bite, so I imagine it to be very good. He also said that the salmon and noodles were surprisingly a very good combo (if you haven't noticed a trend yet here, it's that this place is full of wonderful surprises for your taste buds!)

One was attracted to my wine glass, another just wanted to crawl on our table and the third just liked flying in our faces. This started off our meal- oh joy. The Pho was very good and the ravioli appetizer also pretty decent. We shared 2 main dishes that were nothing special, especially for the price. They were fine to eat, but nothing to rave about at all, I am really baffled by the reviews of people who love this place. Also, one of our main dishes had 2 pieces of hair in it-YUM! We were on a time crunch, and just picked it out and didn't complain, so I am not sure what they would have done. The food even without the hair is like food I would usually pay $8 for, if even that.

2012-06-13,4.0,"Le Colonial has never disappointed. I came here a few years ago for an anniversary dinner and had a great time. I was excited to find out that we had a work dinner scheduled here and couldn't believe that years had lapsed since my last visit. Upon arrival we were seated towards the back of the restaurant near the kitchen. The lights were low, creating a very classy (and romantic if you're on a date) atmosphere. The restaurant was bustling at 6:30 on a Tuesday night, so make sure that you have a reservation. We had a very attentive waitress who took our drink orders as soon as we were settled and gave us some helpful suggestions regarding the appetizers. We ordered three appetizers for our group of four to go with our wine. I don't remember which appetizers we had specifically, but one was a lettuce wrap with deep-fried pork and shrimp with a spicy chili sauce. This was the most memorable appetizer as it was extremely flavorful and the chili sauce was fantastic. We also ordered an ""Vietnamese ravioli"" that I wasn't a fan of--it was luke warm and boring. It consisted of what I believed to be chicken and/or bean sprouts and was missing a lot of spices. Although the waitress was extremely enthusiastic about this dish, I could've easily passed on this one. The last appetizer was a basic spring roll which wasn't bad but wasn't great, nothing was memorable. For the main entree I went with #39: Bitet Tom Nuong which is grilled filet mignon  and sautéed shrimp served with tomato rice pilaf and mesclun greens. Upon ordering this I was surprised that they didn't ask what temperature I preferred the beef to be cooked to. Regardless, when the dish came out it was a very thin filet mignon that appeared to be cut in two, and it was cooked to a medium-well. It had a fantastic glaze on it that was chili-sweet and paired nicely with the tomato rice pilaf. As for the shrimp, they were slightly spiced and incredibly succulent. A small bite of the beef, shrimp, and rice pilaf was to die for, and I made sure to dice up my steak and shrimp into small bites to get the most out of this flavor combination. As for the mesclun greens, they were tossed in some sort of light olive oil/spiced dressing that was delicious and a great compliment to the steak and shrimp. We sadly passed up on the desserts, but they had a great offering that I would love to try the next time I'm there. If you're in the mood for an interesting fusion, or if you just love Vietnamese food with a twist, I'd highly recommend this restaurant. It's in a great area of the city that's always bustling at night, resulting in a great Chicago experience.",0.998,0.766,0.194,0.04,0.6435222222222221
2012-06-09,2.0,"Le Colonial is the latest in a series of sub-par Asian restaurants I've tried since coming to Chicago.  Perhaps it's my roots on the West Coast, or the extensive time I've spend in Asia, but I've had more misses than hits in this category recently. Le Colonial bills itself as a French-Vietnamese restaurant harking back to the French-Indonesian period around the turn of the century.  They got the ambience right, but that was about it.  The service tended toward the snooty, and the food was just average.  Most of the dishes were exact duplicates, or slight adaptations of what you'd find at street corners in Vietnam, or hole-in-the-wall eateries on the West Coast.  But the good thing about street food is that you get it piping hot off the grill and you can try lots of tasty little bites.  The food here was overwrought and nearly cold by the time it got to our table, and the flavor profiles varied from bland to over-salted.  We also tried a few of their ""famous"" house cocktails and were equally underwhelmed.   Oh--and it costs about five-times as much as the tasty hole in the wall joints.  I really wanted to like this place, but just couldn't bring myself to wright a positive review.",0.8911,0.93,0.057,0.013,0.4506591892955528

2012-05-11,5.0,"During my first year of college in 1998 I was taken to Le Colonial on the first date I had ever been on in Chicago. I was a ripped jeans wearing mess and an unadventurous eater. I only ordered the baby-back rib appetizer because I had no idea what the hell anything else was. I felt extremely out of my element and couldn't wait to leave. After a way too hot cab ride where the driver tried to get me to join his ministry to my discomfort,  I returned to Le Colonial  today and fell in love. I wanted pretty much everything on the menu. I had to have the grilled shrimp on sugar cane. It was beautiful and so tasty. So amazing. I really wanted the grilled sesame beef too. It was so good. And the cold spicy beef salad with lemongrass was every bit as perfect as I had hoped it would be...especially once you worked your way down and the greens were fantastically drenched in spicy chili garlic vinagrette. For a cold salad the heat was so wonderful. The highlight of the meal was without a doubt the trout. This was obviously fished for in heaven and steamed in a banana leaf with cellophane noodles for my pleaure only. This dish included oyster mushrooms and a truly magnificent curry sauce on the side. The leaf was opened delicately by a server. This was so incredible that I can't even describe it and would fail if I tried to capture the magic. All I know is that if I were Cher and could turn back time I would still be eating this at this very moment instead of writing this review. Service couldn't have been nicer and what a great interior. How had I not noticed ANY of this on my first visit? As I enjoyed this meal with my husband I couldn't help thinking serveral times about how happy I am that I have grown up into a person that can appreciate every thing Chicago has to offer. Le Colonial is amazing. I'm sure that it always has been. Thank God I at least knew enough when I was young to date men with better taste than me.

Sliced beef sirloin with lettuce wrap:  WARNING! this shares the same idea with a lettuce wrap appetizer. Beware what you order SIDE DISH- Grilled Eggplant! This is heavenly. It's nothing like the soggy grilled eggplant you get in  Italian restaurants. This is legit thinly sliced small cut eggplants marinated with Asian spices, garlic and a kick of lemon.

We selected from their RW Dinner 2 menu: Beignets stuffed with Shrimp, Monkfish, Diced Filet Mignon, Shrimp Curry, Shrimp Fried Rice, Cellophane noodles, banana wonton and Mango Sundae. What can I say expect that everything was delish.  The servers were attentive, but not over bearing. Everything came out right on time. Very nice atmosphere. Upstairs there was a DJ and the music was nice. This is a nice place to hang out with a few friends and a great place for date night any day of the week!",0.9796,0.796,0.204,0.0,0.7857142857142856
2012-02-24,5.0,"I've wanted to go to Le Colonial since forever and finally got to go today for dinner. Thank you, Chicago Restaurant Week! I heart you so much! Valet was $9 here which isn't too bad for a city restaurant. We got to our reservation about 10 minutes early & were seated immediately. Our table spot was a bit out of the way which was great for me so I could snap pictures of my food to my heart's content! The downside was it was right next to the door so would sometimes get reallly cold as we sat there. There was a little heater near us (see picture!) that kept showing me the tempature right by us. It stayed around 72 the whole night but at some points when the door was open it would get down to 59 & 60 degrees...toooo coooolllldddd! The portions were huge here! Sometimes places cut the portions for restaurant week patrons down quite a bit, but I'm pleased to say the portions was humungous here for every course. To go with my $33 Restaurant Week Menu, I got a $13 guava liquor infused drink to wet my palette. It turned out to be a great compliment to my meal. For my first course, I had the pho and was surprised at the size of the bowl. It wasn't the full size I'm used to at Vietnamese restaurants but it was much bigger than I imagined a pho appetizer would be. Plus it was fantastic! The broth had good flavor with just a dash of spice. The noodles & beef in the pho were cooked perfectly. I loved the dish! As my main dish, I had the Ca Nuong...again a huge portion! This dish is salmon cooked medium rare over vermicelli noodles in fish sauce with a salad on the side. I didn't need the salad at all but I loved the main components of the dish! The salmon may have been the best I've had----cooked to perfection! And the vermicelli noodles in fish sauce were (licking my fingers right now like those cheesy people in movies)---Delish!  My dessert was one scoop of mango sorbet & one scoop of raspberry sorbet. Both were amazing! They were so refreshing & fruity! I liked the raspberry the best but both were an amazing end to an amazing meal. Go to Le Colonial during Restaurant Week!!! Go other times! It's all sorts of awesome!",0.9987,0.767,0.224,0.009,0.6256330309901739
2012-02-24,5.0,"I'm completely smitten and madly in love with Le Colonial. Since moving out of the city, Le Colonial is what I miss the most. ((Well, and frequently trying hot, new restaurants)). I went back recently, and my experience was just like every time before - fabulous.  Visually, Le Colonial is gorgeous. Mind blowing gorgeous. It's intimate, romantic, dimly lit,  and beautifully decorated. I imagine it's what it would feel like dining in an extravagant restaurant in French Polynesia.  The service is fantastic. The servers are extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the menu and drinks. They time dishes perfectly so you have time in between courses to sit back for a few and have a drink.  Clearly, the food is the star of this show. Le Colonial merges two of my favorite cuisines....French and Vietnamese. The food is elegant and full of flavor. Portions are on the smaller side which is good because you can try more, but it also can increase the size of your bill. Is it worth it?? You're damn right it is! Although you can't go wrong with anything you order, these are my recommendations... + PHO Hearty oxtail soup with rice noodles, beef tenderloin slices, & aromatic herbs +BO BIA Soft salad rolls of julienne carrots & jicama, bean sprouts, egg, peanuts, & aromatic herbs in rice paper, with peanut plum dipping sauce + BANH CUON  Steamed Vietnamese ravioli of chicken & asian mushrooms, chili lime garlic sauce + BANH UOT Grilled sesame beef rolled in flat rice noodles, With cucumber, lettuce, basil, & lime garlic sauce + GOI CUON GA Soft salad rolls of grilled chicken, cucumber, basil, mint, cilantro, bean sprouts, rice vermicelli, & crispy rice paper with coconut plum dipping sauce + BO SATE Sautéed diced filet mignon with sate spice, yams, & String beans + GA XAO CARI Sautéed diced chicken with Japanese eggplant, mango, yams, string beans, & cashew nuts In a yellow curry sauce + TAU HU CARI Lightly fried tofu with eggplant, asparagus, mango, yams, & cashew nuts in yellow coconut curry sauce For dessert, the banana wontons are a MUST. If you leave without ordering the warm bananas fried in a crispy wonton, laying in a small bath of creme fraiche and chocolate, you will regret it.

We started with the Pho and Ca Bam Xuc Banh Trang.  I loved the Pho, and my Dh preferred the Monkfish.  Needless to say after starting the dinner with tasty apps were were ready to be blown away. Next we had Ca Nuong and Cari Tom, the Salmon was perfectly grilled, nice char marks on the outside and a beautiful medium-rare on the inside.  The rest of of the dish was OK, and my husband was underwhelmed by the coconut curry, said it seemed watered down.  On to dessert, I had the Banana Wonton and he had the Macaroon, both were delicious, but I wish that the Wonton came with Ice Cream.  I still give them 4 stars even though 1 course wasn't the best.  The ambiance, wine list, servers, and Pho make up for any mishaps.

I had one mingled with cucumber, basil, and pear while my friend had a delectable pineapple concoction. My only complaints are the tables are teeny tiny and you have to maneuver around the plates scattered about, they rush you, and the busboys don't communicate with each other and ask you every few minutes if you're done eating.

2011-10-03,5.0,"Fantastic up and down! Absolutely tremendous in all facets! My wife took me to Le Colonial for my birthday and it was such a treat. I loved the decor and ambiance in LC, from the trees to the dark wood shutters to the perfect lighting. I did feel like I was dining in another country.   The staff was excellent, from the host to the servers. I must say that our server (I wish we caught his name) was one of the most attentive, kindest and helpful servers we've ever had. He was such a joy to have and went the extra mile. When we sat down we were brought a glass of champagne each and told ""happy anniversary."" Well, we know this was a mistake as we've only been married three months but we played along!  Anyways, that's not why we loved the server, it was more about how he was attentive but not overbearing, and knew how to properly space out the appetizers and entrees we ordered. We started with the oxtail pho (vietnamese soup, sounds like fa) and the server knew we were splitting this and the beignets stuff with shrimp and veggies. The pho came out split for both us and shortly after we finished the beignets came out.   First off, my wife and I both love Vietnamese food and frequent spots on Argyle and Broadway and have had pho many times. But we've never tasted anything so delicious as the oxtail pho. The flavors were well balanced but complex. Rich flavor and great texture with vermicelli noodles and thin tender slices of beef tenderloin that just melted in my mouth.  I literally could have 5 bowls of this pho. The beignets were fantastic and a perfect compliment to the pho. The beignets were fried around the shrimp so the tail acted as a sort of handle. The veggies were stuffed inside and the combination with the sweet and sour sauce was really nice. For our entrees we split the mussels (an app) that is cooked in a basic butter cream sauce and the bo sate, which is chunks of filet mignon with sate sacue, yams and string beans. The mussels were great and the basic butter cream sauce provided a great flavor profile. While I was a fan of the mussels I still prefer ordering them from Hopleaf or Purple Pig.   Now, for the bo sate...wow! I've never tasted anything so delicious and well balanced as this dish.  The filet was so ultra tender and juicy and the yams and string beans were cooked to perfection. The sate sauce that the meat and veggies were cooked in was complex but no overpowering. There was such a great explosion of flavor but everything was almost subtle.  The dish came with white rice which was great for using every bit of sauce left on the plate. Before we get to desert we did have some cocktails. My wife had a martini and a glass of wine (I think...I can't remember now) and I had a Ha Long Fizz which had Hendricks gin, basil, lime, mint and club soda and another cocktail that was great but a little too candy-like for my taste (gin, pomegranate, fruit juice and some other ingredients). So, the desert. I had head that we should try the banana tapioca or the banana wontons but after seeing another couple next to use order the macaroon, we were sold. This was a really great end to a fantastic meal. The macaroon was cut into a large square, topped with Ciao Bella vanilla gelato and drizzled with chocolate. The macaroon was moist, chewy and flavorful and the gelato with chocolate sauce was a nice compliment. I really can't say enough about the overall experience my wife and I had at Le Colonial and can't wait to come back.

What we ordered (4 people): Appetizers:  Shrimp Beignets -- delicious, but I expected a true, funnel-cake like beignet.  It was more of a shrimp wrapped in wonton to me??  But the shrimp was so plump and delicious, and the dipping sauce was SO YUM! Mussels in Saffron Butter sauce -- omg, probably the best mussels I've ever had.  We tried to get more bread out of the waiters to dip into the delicious buttery sauce...but they were a little sparse haha.   Entrees: Ginger Duck with Tamarind -- yum!  but no sides, so be sure to get some (definitely recommend the grilled Japanese eggplant) Filet Mignon with shrimp rice -- THE BEST ENTREE AT THE TABLE.  Ssoo tender and flavorful. Shrimp with Asparagus -- ssoo flavorful yet light!  My friend cleaned her plate it was a perfect entree! Desserts: TOTALLY RECOMMEND BOTH: Banana tapioca and banana wonton.

2011-09-01,5.0,"It's been a number of years since I had the pleasure of dining at Le Colonial, but judging by the meal I enjoyed last night, suffice it to say that it won't be nearly as long for me to return next time.  My beau and I had made a reservation a long time ago for a table outside (all the better for people watching on Rush Street). I wasn't sure if the weather would cooperate, and truthfully, it wouldn't have mattered as the interior of the restaurant is lovely too. I always feel as if I'm an extra on the set of ""Casablanca"" when I'm here. It has that exotic and romantic ambiance. it's one of the prettiest restaurants in the city, imho.  But the decor isn't the only thing to rave about at Le Colonial, their food is nothing short of spectacular. They do everything right.  Mother Nature didn't open the skies and rain on us yesterday so we were able to score a table outside. To be honest, I almost wish we were seated inside as their chairs on their outside seating area are some of the most uncomfortable chairs I've ever sat in. They're like cheap lawn chairs. My ass hurt during my entire dinner :(  But back to the food --I've been reliving the menu in my head all morning. Each and every dish was fantastic, in both flavor and presentation.  We ordered two appetizers, a salad, and an entree, intending to share. I couldn't have been happier with our selections:  Banh Uot - grilled sesame beef rolled in flat rice noodles, and served with cucumbers, basil, lettuce and lime garlic sauce. This was love at first bite. All the flavors and textures worked well together. The beef was tender, the rice noodles soft, and the vegetables were crunchy. Perfection.  Ca Song - LC's version of tuna tartare. This was easily in the top three tuna tartares I've ever eaten. It was delicate but flavorful, and very fresh. And I loved the won ton crackers that it's served with.  Goi Bun So - this was a grilled sea scallop salad served with garlic noodles, roasted peanuts and lime vinaigrette over mesclun greens. Listen, I didn't even like scallops until about two months ago, so I don't have a lot to compare them to, but again, this was a great dish. The scallops (four large ones) were meaty but not overpowering, and the garlic noodles were a great complement, especially when combined with the lime vinaigrette.  Ca Hap - steamed fillets of Chilean sea bass in a light ginger broth, with tomatoes, oyster mushrooms, scallions, and fried ginger with cellophane noodles. The fish was light and the vegetables gave the dish that extra ""oomph,"" and I especially enjoyed the fried ginger.  Their cocktail list is quite extensive and I had a hard time narrowing down my choices as each drink sounded better than the last. Their delicious concoctions feature lemongrass, ginger, and fresh herbs. We ended up choosing the Ha Long fizz which was Hendrick's, muddled cucumber and mint, green tea and club soda. i don't think I've had a more refreshing drink, and it was ideal for the warm evening.  With all that food you'd think there's no way we'd saved room for dessert, but the food is so light that even though you feel quite satisfied, you don't feel stuffed. I was surprised that their dessert list featured sorbets and ice creams that weren't house made and instead were the brand 'Ciao Bella,' so we opted for a caramelized lemon tart instead (even though sorbet would have been the perfect finish).  The pleasantly tart lemon tart came with a shortbread crust, a lightly bruleed topping, and whipped cream on the side. Polished off in record time.  Dinner at Le Colonial was definitely five-star worthy, but the service was a tiny bit slow at the end (it took a while to get the check and close out), and those chairs (my ass still hurts) keep this from being a truly five star review, so consider this 4.5 stars, with room for improvement.  I cannot recommend Le Colonial highly enough; truly one of the best meals I've had all year.",0.9992,0.751,0.206,0.043,0.5827601410934744

2011-08-06,3.0,"""This place reminds me of New Orleans."" Before I came to dinner, I read that Le Colonial was ""Chicago's noted up-scale French-Vietnamese restaurant which vividly recaptures the beauty, romance and spirit of French colonial Southeast Asia from the 1920s."" Apart from the waiters who were appropriately dressed, nothing about the place in terms of the interiors screamed ""French"" or ""Vietnamese"". It was very old-fashioned and it did make me crave for some cajun food. Alas, I was not here for that. Still, I was a but curious to try some new flavors since French and Vietnamese were two types of food that I had yet to try together. I went with a group of seven women (thank god they all refrained from girl talk for most of the evening!). The group was served a unique tasting menu as follows: Cha Gio (spring rolls w/pork, shrimp and mushrooms served with sauce), Bo Bia (salad rolls w/carrots, jicama, bean sprouts, egg, peanuts served with sauce) and Banh Cuon (Vietnamese Ravioli w/chicken and mushrooms served with sauce). Both rolls were very good; the ravioli didn't have enough taste to me.   The entrees we had were Mi Xao Don Chay (Stir fry veggies w/tofu over egg noodles and sauce), Bo Sate (filet mignon w/sate spice, yams and string beans), Ca Nuong (salmon over noodles w/dill, greens, and sauce) and Ga Xao Cari (chicken w/ eggplant, mango, yams, beans, nuts and curry sauce). I thought three of the four entrees were excellent; they all had a flavorful mix of ingredients and tasted really good. I thought only the Don Chay was ok. For dessert, we had coconut macaroons w/ vanilla ice cream on top. YUM. I sort of felt guilty that I didn't go for thirds because there was a lot of portions left. With a table full of women, you know they all are going to force the guy to finish it! Ah well, it was not to be.  I also ordered a mekong sunset, which was mainly vodka, ginger tea, and club soda. Not bad, considering it came off of their low-cal cocktail menu. Thank goodness I also wasn't in proximity to any men or else I would have had my man card revoked for drinking a girly cocktail.  Service was good, although when the group decided to divide the cocktail bill individually, the waiter gave us a bit of attitude.  Overall, I was expecting to go to a french/vietnamese restaurant that served a mix of both of those types of cuisine. I'd categorize my experience as going more to a vietnamese restaurant. It's only french by it's name. I don't think you should claim to be a french restaurant if you don't serve that type of cuisine.

Perfect portion for appetizer. Then we had number 25. ""Bun thit nuong"" for entree. It was a great combination of noodle, bbq pork, different kinds of greens and a special mix of lime garlic fish sauce. I totally love it.  We also had some cocktails ..

Ca tim nuong (roasted eggplant)- it was a nice veggie side and tasted just like how my mom makes it.  the only thing that was missing from the dinner was a fried banana with vanilla ice cream dessert....but they didn't have that on the menu and thats all that we wanted to eat! lol.  overall it was a great dinner. overpriced for vietnamese food but you get the nice ambiance and great service. a good place to start if you're wanting to try vietnamese food and not brave enough to go to a less main stream place up on argyle.",0.9961,0.778,0.194,0.028,0.5030753968253968

I ordered a curry dish, and it was good curry, but I kicked myself a little for ordering the wrong thing. After tasting everyone else's, I realized I should have ordered one of the more traditional dishes. They know what their doing with their flavor combos.

It's very welcoming, warm and good on the eyes. High ceilings, large plants and orchids are on all the tables. It made me feel like I was on an island. Very relaxing. Todays menu consisted of the following: -BANH CUON Steamed Vietnamese ravioli of chicken & asian mushrooms, with chili lime garlic sauce. This was really good and light. The flavors all went well together. -CA BAM XUC BANH TRANG Wok-seared monkfish with chili, turmeric, lemongrass, peanuts, & crisp toasted sesame crackers. The aroma of this dish is intoxicating. Smelled so good and tasted even better. They give more crackers than the monkfish, so go easy on it. -CA SONG Tuna tartare with tomatoes, cilantro, & cucumber, Tossed in ginger soy dressing; with wonton crisps. This was extremely refreshing. I love Tuna Tartare and this was very good. Ask for some lime and squeeze it over the wonton crisps to add more flavor to the meal. -CA NUONG LA CHUOI Grilled trout with oyster mushrooms, dried mushrooms & cellophane noodles, served steamed in a banana leaf with curry sauce on the side. This is served with a side of rice, but it's not needed since there is a good amount of noodles on top. The curry sauce is very light and the noodles absorb it all and makes the dish very good.

I was really impressed by the clean, exotic, romantic appeal when I walked into this restaurant.  I've always been slightly interested in going, but this venture in to grab a menu really sealed the deal for me. It is now only a matter of time.  The music was low and seductive, the palms and white decor reminiscent of a different place and time. After arguing with a lady on the phone the next day when trying to place the lunch order for myself and my colleagues (I had been assured they *do* deliver to the Millennium Knickerbocker) a nice man took over and completely took care of me. Our food arrived in nice containers with ample utensils - and ingredients (like my fish dumplings) separated out to keep them from getting soggy before their arrival.   I found the soup a bit more oily than I like, but the dumplings were very scrumptious and the seasonings in the soup were delightful. Also delightful was the scallop and ginger noodle salad.  I really had no idea what to expect from this dish, and found it fresh and light. All in all a great lunch.

Next for our main course we got the Ga Xao Xa Ot to split and this was seared lemongrass chicken over mushrooms and a basil chili sauce. We also got  a side of shrimp fried rice. The dish had a wonderful presentation and the chicken was tender and spicy! The fried rice was so-so and could have used a little more flavor but their homemade chili sauce helped with that. For dessert we had vanilla ice cream with dark chocolate hot sauce over coconut macaroon and it was so tasty (recommended by Francisco of course).

Thank god I have excellent night vision, I saw people using cell phones, table candles and key chain flashlights to read menus.  The darkness might be used to encourage the noise level to come down a notch, but it wasn't helping. I felt like I was in a diner after the bars had closed. The woman to my left was telling a story about how she and her fiance were going to wait awhile, who here bridesmaids were going to be and how she was going to be a ""bridezilla"" while the group to my right was discussing a mans post traumatic stress and how he disliked sitting with his back to the door. It was so loud I had to lean across the table to speak to my boyfriend while still raising my voice. Ridiculous. My boyfriends chair also kept getting run into a lot. The place was over crowded to the point of discomfort. The food. Lets start with portion size. Typically appetizers are portioned about the same as other appetizers on the menu, same with entrees. Not here. The apps it wasn't as noticeable because we were sharing, but the entrees... I was done 15 minutes before my boyfriend. His dish was easily 3x the size of mine. It made no sense. Desserts were the opposite, mine was huge and his was tiny... Presentation and taste were meh. The apps were ok. The cold beef salad was decent. The tuna tartar had good texture, decent flavor, presentation sucked (molded and surrounded by a few chips on a plate with some cucumber slices) I have made better at home. Entees were sub-par. My fish was mushy and tasted as though it had been frozen. My boyfriends chicken was mediocre at best. Desserts were unoriginal and  also lacked presentation. Service, wow... You know how you will be sitting in a restaurant and you will wonder if they have forgotten about you? Just about the time we would start wondering was about the time our server would show up. Any time our server would pass and we would try to flag her down she would conveniently be looking the other way. She was nice, but seemingly on autopilot. In total we got 2 apps, 2 entrees, 2 desserts and 4 drinks. Our bill totaled $170. We had 2 gift certificates ( not groupons, not  restaurants.com   coupons, actual gift certificates) that we had received as gifts to use for our bill. They argued that we couldn't use both at once.

Our server was helpful and attentive.  I really liked him and appreciated the good service.  He even checked to make sure we had enough time to get my husband and coworker back to work- even though they can take as long as they want at lunch.  Thoughtful.   The highlight of the meal was the cha gio- a fried roll with a side of  veggies to wrap around it.  Totally delicious.  I will be back for this appetizer and a cocktial next time. The other parts of the meal were not too exciting for me:  banh Pho Xao and Crispy banana wonton With crème anglaise & DARK CHOCOLATE SAUCE.  The entree was fine but dull.  It was very similar to lad nar, and unfortunately, I have had better versions.  The dessert would have been delicious with chocolate inside the wonton with the bananas.  They do something similar at Ben Pao, which is not as nice of a restaurant as Le Colonial.  The dessert at Ben Pao is much better.

2011-02-21,3.0,"I went to Le Colonial with my girlfriend last Saturday. We went on a last-minute whim and the restaurant had no problem seating us. Overall the service was great, the food was good, but the price point was too high. I expected Le Colonial to have much more of a  twist on Vietnamese classics (which already have some French Influence), however what I found was that although the flavors were spot on, they weren't any better than I would find at a standard Vietnamese restaurant on Argyle.  The one memorable dish was the Bouillabaisse (a French Shellfish stew). It brought a good amount of seafood and the flavors were great. However, this was a standard French dish in my opinion and was missing any fusion factor.  We had some other items on the menu such at the Spring rolls and the Vietnamese ravioli. Again the food was good, but missing the extra ""uumph"" to justify the price. All in all the restaurant was good. My expectations may have been skewed because I was expecting more of a fusion factor, however what I found was an offering of standard Vietnamese fare at a premium.  Summary: if you have never had Vietnamese food before, and want to start at a place where you can feel comfortable with the menu and guarantee consistency I would recommend Le Colonial. However, if you are more adventurous, venture down to Argyle (thinking Tank Noodle specifically) or even Chinatown (Cafe Huang) for some quality authentic Vietnamese food at a MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE price point.",0.9793,0.821,0.135,0.044,0.3942114695340503

We went for a friends birthday which also happened to be Christmas Eve. There were 7 of us in the party and we were all looking forward to eating here. The waitress seemed indifferent at first and this theme seemed to continue through the night. Drinks and food were ordered and she went on her way. Plates started coming out however only a few at a time. The staff served some of our party and left the rest hopelessly salivating over the others food. It was a good 20 minutes before the whole table was finally served. During this time, we asked the waitress and other servers where the rest of our food was. The waitress said she had called down for it and it should be right up. This was prior to the 20 min wait and she never once apologized or offered to take anything off the bill for us. She walked past us 3 or 4 times without even a reassuring glance our way to let us know that we wouldnt have to wait much longer. By the time the whole table was served the people who had been served first were already finished with their food and they were clearing away their plates. Really? Isn't this supposed to be fine dining and on Christmas Eve/special birthday none the less!  We grumbled a bit over this but were generally happy with the quality of the food until we received the bill. We all agreed the reason why the server did not seem to care to much about whether our food ever came out or not was because the restaurant had already slapped a 20% tip on to the total. We are all very generous tippers, however with her uncaring attitude we probably would have only left around 10% given the chance.  We mentioned this to the hostess who claimed she was also the manager and she said next time we come in she will give us free appetizers. Not sure how she was going to identify us the next time we come in, but it wont be a problem as we wont be back.

2010-12-10,2.0,"Came here on a coworkers recommendation.  Was really surpised to find a 25 min wait at 9:00pm on a Tuesday night.  Luckily the hostess told us we could grab food at the bar upstairs. I gotta say the bar tender was great, very cordial, great with recommendations, she aptly warned us when we might be ordering too much but didn't impose when we didn't go with her recommendation. Ok, maybe it's cause I'm from LA but the prices are a little steep for Vietnamese food.  Then again, there didn't seem to be whole lot of Asian food in the area.  Flavors were spot on though.  Here's what we had. 1) Ca Chien Saigon - Crisp, seared whole red snapper with a light, spicy-sour sauce - market price (about $35 see picture in gallery) Apparently this is one of the dishes they are know for.  The waitress recommended this.  Nice spice, not overly hot.  Goes really well with the rice and deboned so you have very accessible fish fillets.  You may want to steer away if you're not used to asian corn starch sauce. 2) Ca Hap - Steamed fillets of Chilean sea bass, with cellophane noodles, oyster mushrooms, tomatoes, scallions, & fried ginger in a light ginger broth - market price ($33 i believe).  A good dish, but not as flavorful as the Red Snapper.   3) Bo Luc Lac - Salad of warm, seared filet mignon over watercress with red wine vinaigrette $12.00.  Well seasoned, not a lot of places keep the beef warm on this salad.  Vinaigrette was nice, not overly potent. PHO - Hearty oxtail soup with rice noodles, beef tenderloin slices, & aromatic herbs 6.50.  As a rule of thumb you don't order Pho from restaurant in LA if it's not the first item on the menu (probably mean's it's not their specialty).  Not sure if that applies in Chicago and my coworker was sick so we let it slide. Noodles were a little on the soggy side and the broth was a little week but acceptable as far as Pho goes. We ordered a dessert as well.

2010-11-13,3.0,"OK the interior is adorable, and I felt like I was stepping into the 1920s.  I did not enjoy the layout of the restaurant, since it was so tiny, the tables against the wall are literally side-to-side touching -- meaning they lock you into the booth, and the manager comes over to move the table if you need to get out. We used an A-la-card and shared 4 appetizers -- #1, #6, #8 and #11.  Yes, I gave you numbers. I mostly enjoyed the crispy spring rolls.  It was nicely fried w/o being oily.  And I enjoyed the pickled carrots & daikon, and mint & cilantro to fill your little wrap with.  Oh yeah, you're supposed to wrap the spring roll in a piece of lettuce. The ravioli was tasty as well -- get it! For the prices, I felt the presentation of the dishes should have been better.  The flavors are cleaner than what you'd get in Viet-town, and you're paying for the service too. Funny story: A dude in the group next to us was claiming he was allergic to fish sauce and demanded no fish sauce in any of his food.  Seriously, if you're allergic to fish sauce (I'm pretty sure he just secretly didn't like it), you should not be visiting a Vietnamese restaurant.",0.9826,0.765,0.181,0.054,0.6659722222222222

2010-11-05,2.0,"I really wanted to like Le Colonial more. Reserved a table here for my anniversary with the bf after much research into good Chicago restaurants. The ambiance is indeed wonderful, and every detail is thoughtfully beautiful. It's a crowded restaurant with small tables, so I'd recommend going earlier in the evening (we went at 5:30) to avoid too many people. This is a very romantic restaurant, and they are definitely catering to couples by playing really nice romantic music.  On to the food. We both ordered cocktails. They were tasty and unique, which I like, but very expensive ($12-13) and low on actual alcohol. For an appetizer, we ordered the Banh Uot (sesame beef rolled in rice noodles). This was ok, but in my opinion nothing truly special. Not quite worth the $10. My entree was the Bun Thit Nuong, or barbecued pork over noodles. It basically tasted like plain old barbecue pork you can get for $7 at any Vietnamese restaurant. Not that exciting, and definitely not worth $20. The bf had Bo Bitet Tom Nuong, or the steak and shrimp dish with tomato rice pilaf. His entree was wonderful. The steak was tender and juicy, with absolutely exquisite flavor. I didn't try the shrimp (they gave him only 3), but the rice pilaf was also delicious. His meal was very unique, and I believe worth the $28 it cost.  A note on the service.... all of the waiters were polite and accommodating. However, they majorly hovered (a pet peeve of mine!). An army of servers positioned themselves throughout the restaurant and waited. The result of this was that 50% of the time, there was a server literally standing 6 inches from our table. He had his back to us, but it truly made me feel as though we could not have a private conversation. I'm all for good service, but I also appreciate privacy! Overall, I was pleased with our meal but not thrilled. The ambiance was beautiful and romantic, but overall the food was mediocre and VERY expensive. I was especially disappointed with my entree, which was quite plain. I guess if you order correctly (as my bf did), you would have a better experience. But I believe that if a restaurant is going to get away with charging huge prices, they sure as hell better have the food to back it up. I don't think I would come here again.

It was also kinda noisy, and I had a difficult time conversing with people at the other end of the table. Now the food. Because I am Asian, I actually know about Asian food. Although the restaurant is advertised as French-Vietnamese fusion restaurant, to me the food is more like overpriced Chinese food. I mean, these are modified Chinese cooking, but the foundation is the same. Fried rice, fried noodle, kungpao chicken, some Vietnamse sidedish here and there, you get the idea, with fancy names that I can't even pronounce. The food is presented in good visual quality, but I don't think it is worth the price. The lounge upstairs gave us a better experience. The waitress was more appropriate and nicer.

The ravioli was a little dry unless you make sure to put the sauce on it.  Once the sauce was put on it was pretty good.  For entrees we ordered Ga Xao Xa Ot (lemon grass chicken) and the Vit Quay (duck). The lemon grass chicken was a bit average to be honest, nothing really special. It was tasty though.  The real gem in this was the mushrooms that were in with the chicken - they were divine.  The duck was good, crunchy skin, moist meat, and tasty sauce.  Overall though the appetizer and chicken which were both recommended to us dragged the weighting down from the duck, which was excellent.

The waitress (I think there should be more of a title given to her since she was incredibly knowledgeable and friendly) was very attentive and provided excellent suggestions for a wine that would go well with our dinner. We started off with two appetizers (the wok seared monk fish and the shrimp beinget stuffed with chicken and vegetables). Monk fish is not a pretty fish. If you watch any of the travel channel show, you can bet you will see a freshly caught Monk Fish on one of the No Reservation shows and say that there is no way you will ever eat a fish that looks that fugly. But, put those thoughts aside my friends because that is one delicious appetizer. For my main course, I had the barbecued pork over angel hair noodles. The pork was well seasoned and cooked perfectly. The great surprise about the dish is that it has an amazing salad along side it. It seemed like the perfect dish could fill you up and not have you sweating uncontrollably if you were in heat and humidity of Vietnam. If there was anything that I could have improved on the dinner would have been the cocktail. I had the Saigon Sling and was expecting it to have more of a pineapple taste to it. But hey, if that is the only thing that I have to complain about, then it was a great evening all the way around.  I also have to say that the atmosphere was very nice. It gave the place a very elegant, but yet relaxing feel. I was expecting the the atmosphere to be much more stuffy and serious, but it was a lot of fun.

Can't complaint about the food at all. The server on the first visit was great. She was friendly and caring. She always noticed when out glasses are empty and filled it up promptly. She also tried not to disturb our dinner and conversation. It seemed like she read our minds and knew when we need her. The first visit could be a 5-star experience. BUT, I give it a two-star rating because the server on the second visit was horribly rude and didn't care much about us. He was ok until the entrees were served.

But we're kind of easy-going, so it was ok.) After the entrees were served, we didn't receive any attention that a restaurant like this (with this price tag) should give.

I'm a slow eater, so when  the rest of my party finished their dishes, I still had almost a half of mine.  Then, all of the sudden, one of the servers came to us and asked if they can take them out. We were kind of shocked because we didn't expect it while one of us were still eating. So, we all didn't respond, then he started taking all of the dishes but mine. It was too fast (and shocking) for us to stop them. I was pressured by the circumstances and rushed to finish mine as soon as possible.

We were seated just long enough to settle in and enjoy the view for a moment when we were greeted by one of the managers of the restaurant, Amy Myers, she explained that the servers were in a transition of one leaving and one arriving but she would be happy to get us a drink in the interim.  Not being quite sure what was the best choice for wine by the glass we left the decision making to her and she did not disappoint I had a lovely white wine which I enjoyed and my partner had a red that we have since ordered a case of to enjoy at home.  When she had gone to get our drinks my partner and I discussed that being unfamiliar with French Colonial Vietnamese food that we would seek Amy's advice on a couple of appetizers to share when she returned with our wine.  Once again she did not disappoint she recommended two of the appetizers which she said were her favorites, both of which were absolutely delicious.  By the point that we finished our appetizers the new shift of servers had arrived and several of them had checked on us to make sure that we had everything that we could need.  We decided after having enjoyed the wine and appetizers we would share an entrée lest we stuff ourselves and later regret having eaten too much.  The entrée recommended by our waiter was the Ga Xao Xa Ot (#41 which is easier to remember).  The lemongrass chicken with Portobello mushrooms was so delicious we both wished we had ordered our own instead of having decided to share.   The concise version of this lengthy review is that Amy Myers and her team deserve an A+++ for the service and attention to detail as well as their knowledge of both the wine list and the menu.

That being said it was interesting setting for a guy who lives on the North side and doesn't frequent downtown too often. The menu was a great mix-up of from your normal cuisine (at least for me) being French Vietnamese. I liked the assortment of dishes that included vegetables, rices, seafood and assorted birds. I ordered up the Sup do bien: Bouillabaisse of coconut saffron lemongrass broth, lobster, mussels, shrimp, scallops, & whitefish, with vermicelli noodles & aromatic herbs. Very delicious but honestly not very filling. Hell, if I am going to an expensive place why not order the most expensive thing on the menu? A mistake on my behalf because a chicken, duck, or fish dish would have suited my palate (and stomach) a little better. So next time I won't stray too far away from what I am comfortable with. Overall of the three plates we ordered were spot on. Desserts were fresh and at seven bucks a pop it's a price I can tolerate. For me this is a place to drive across town for a nice evening out. The service was not abrasive but attentive and the food came out very quickly. I have to say I enjoyed myself thoroughly. So if you are looking for a twist on seafood or just after a feathered friend dish I would stop in. Plan on about 40-60 a person with dessert minus the drinks. Expensive and diverse but worth it.",0.9963,0.799,0.176,0.025,0.560515873015873

Downstairs is certainly pretty, but a bit formal, and upstairs offers a a small patio and an incredibly comfortable lounge area.

In my time here in Chicago (over a year and a half) this was the only restaurant where the service ruined my dining experience. The server was rude, pretentious, unresponsive, and acted like we just didn't belong there. The thing is, I'm one of those people that can care less about service in the scheme of dining experience. But I found out, if you don't have service at all, it'll ruin everything. So to sum it up, if you are into horrible service and over-priced average food, Le Colonial is the place for you. To the restaurant's defense, my bf didn't exactly look like one of the Gold Coast snobs with a shiny Bentley parked in front of the restaurant, nor did I look like one of the shallow housewives that feels home at ""Viagra triangle"".

2010-07-15,2.0,"Le Colonial was previously one of my top restaurants in Chicago.  The last few times my husband and I have dined here we've left unimpressed and after the last time, we won't be returning. We were seated in the back of the very beautiful restaurant (which is fine), but the tables are so close together that it is nearly impossible to slide between them to sit on the bench, let alone to hear your dining companion over the next table's conversation. Our server was rude and pretentious.  On a previous visit, a server had recommended ordering the lemongrass chicken with tofu instead since I'm a vegetarian.  I took her suggestion, absolutely loved the dish and have ordered it ever since.  On this occasion when I ordered, our server said that the chef has paired each meat to the proper sauce believing that this is the best combination, and couldn't make any substitutions.  As I've ordered this dish before, I asked if he could check with the chef.    He returned and said there would be a $3 up-charge.  Really?  How tacky, especially since everywhere else charges more for chicken than tofu. To add insult to injury while the flavors were delicious, the tofu was incredibly greasy.  Overall, we were disappointed in all the food we ordered.  The Bo Bia salad rolls that were incredible on previous visits had very little of ""aromatic herbs"" this time around.  My husband was not a fan of the tamarind sauce that was served with his duck, but after the previous lecture from our server on the proper sauce being served with each meat, didn't comment. As we were waiting to order dessert, my husband overheard our server commenting that he didn't think we'd ever leave so he could turn over the table.  At this point, we'd been at the restaurant for only 45 minutes.  Well, we did leave, and we won't be back.",0.0754,0.845,0.074,0.082,0.4636363636363636
2010-07-07,1.0,"This is my original review, and as a courtesy to the annoying idiot who owns/runs this place, I've pasted his flame below. My Original Review: Maybe this place is good, but I just don't appreciate it because I'm not asian and haven't eaten in many chinese fine dining places - but wait, I am asian, and I've eaten in some of the best chinese restaurants in Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong. This place is pathetic. You walk in and you can smell the over-salting of the food that makes everything taste like there's MSG in it (whether there is or not). (and yes, I understand this place claims to be Vietnamese, doesn't make the food any better) On its worst day, any decent local chinese place could cook these guys under the table. They certainly couldn't do worse than the bombastic mediocrity that plagues this pretentious bag of wank. If you have no earthly idea what chinese food is (or japanese, or korean), I'm sure you could have a good time here - the faux decor that keeps this place as a colonial abomination should make you feel completely charmed. Usually undistinguished places, I just forget about, but this place was just the kind of place that makes me want to stab myself in the chest. There should be a big sign outside that says ""sham"" and ""bull."" This place was so bad, it almost convinced me you can't get good chinese food anywhere in Chicago - and it's taken me years to recover from the experience. Go there if you want (and if you're gullible), but get ready to poke your eyes (and tongue) out with chopsticks. Business' response (sent to my e-mail address): Well, I have read some uneducated reviews in my life, but this takes the cake. I feel compelled to respond if for none other than for humor sake. First, your first words are that, ""this place is good"". The next paragraph states, "" this place is pathetic"".....Which is it? Then, and this one is good,..... ""When you walk in you smell the over-salting of the food"" I have never smelled, ""over-salting"" of food. What exactly does this smell like?  I've been in the business my entire life and I've never heard anything like this. Clearly there is no MSG in our food and clearly you aren't familiar with Vietnamese food in the least. I'm pretty sure you are Chinese and proud of your culture. That's great, but since we are not a Chinese restaurant (which you seem confused about) you should probably not compare us to your local Chinese spot that can cook us under the table.  And, you really threw me off again with, ""If you have no earthly idea what Chinese food is, you will have a good time here"". ???? Hello... We are not CHINESE and we are NOT a CHINESE restaurant.  Now how about the faux décor?? Are you referring to the French Moroccan floor tiles, the live plants flown in every 8 weeks from Florida, the historical shutters and hardware made by the same company that re-built the Statue of Liberty and the MOMA in NY? Wow are you hopeless! I have never responded to a review like this I my life. I'm fairly certain I never will again. However, I just had to respond to this, the most ignorant, uneducated, moronic review I have ever read. You are a pretentious uneducated bag of wank and should probably steer clear of restaurants that are not Chinese.

We had a reservation for 24 (2 tables of 12).  Upon arriving and finding that the tables weren't ready, we were told we'd only have to wait 10 more minutes.  We had to wait an additional 30-45 minutes past our reservation time to get one table for 12.  The second table for 12 ended up not being free until several hours later.  It appeared that the groups who were 'just above to leave' from the second table had in fact just been seated when we arrived.  The other 12 people in our party split up and sat themselves around the restaurant in a fit of frustration and confusion. The maître d was less than helpful throughout and in conversation refused to accept responsibility for the errors in seating -- instead pinning the blame on our late reservation.  To her benefit, we did end up getting some free spring rolls once we were seated.  I don't know if these are typically free or not. 2)  My food had to be sent back.

I'm not sure whether it was because it was Chef's week and we went off the Chef menu, or whether it was because it was a very slow Tuesday night, but the food underwhelmed and we will not be returning. The service was impeccable - friendly, just enough information, professional.  However, the food was in short, for the most part boring - and in particular not worthy of the hefty prices ($31 for a bland Bouillabaise). We had 4 starters - the Lotus Root and Tofu Salad was superb - the ribs, spring rolls and spinach crab soup were all ok, but nothing special. We had 4 mains - the Bouillabaise was remarkably bland, the chicken was dry and likewise for the pork.  The ambiance is great though.

Very fresh, lots of nice healthy tasting veggies too.  For dinner came the beef medallion filet.  Perfectly prepared and delightful.  Drink menu was interesting too.

2010-02-25,2.0,"With Le Colonial on my restaurant radar for the last 3 years, you can imagine my disappointment after dinner last night.  What's this? Restaurant week prix fixe you say? Well don't mind if I do! Maybe the prix fixe is to blame, but I was incredibly bored with most of our dining experience.  The atmosphere is amazing and beautiful, though the tables are very close together and our server had some trouble maneuvering to even get to our table. Speaking of the server, he was pleasant enough, but very off-putting, strange, and seemed to avoid eye-contact whenever we really wanted his attention.  We ordered drinks, me with a Lychee martini on the recommendation of our server. It was fine, but after the first drink or two, I felt like I was sipping on perfume. My boyfriend had a glass of Pinot that was fine, however.  First Course Pho: Decent, but I've had tastier up on Argyle without the gummy, overdone noodles. Goi Cuon Vit: Basically a salad roll with duck. This was really good, but you could tell it had definitely been prepped earlier in the day. Still, the flavors were nice and the roll was expertly prepared so it didn't fall apart when you took a bite (I hate that). Main Course ca nuong: Grilled salmon over vermicelli noodles; with dill, mesclun greens, & lime garlic fish sauce. I just realized the description mentioned dill which I don't remember even remotely tasting. Add to that list of phantom flavors the lime garlic fish sauce. The noodles were gummy, overcooked and tasteless while the salad was fresh tasting with some pickled veggies, but not dressed, so it was pretty disappointing as well. The salmon was the star of the evening, though. It was cooking incredibly well and very tasty, so I'm pretty sure it was the only thing that was freshly prepared.  Tau Hu Cari: Lightly fried tofu with eggplant, asparagus, mango, yams & cashewsin yellow coconut curry sauce. I talked my boyfriend out of getting the filet because I wanted to split this with him. I apologized. The veggies were all good and the tofu was cooked perfectly, but I don't remember any yams in the dish at all. Maybe they left mine out or were running out from the increased restaurant traffic. The curry, which was the main reason for my selecting the dish, was BORING and BLAND. I was SO disappointed. I'm actually going to say it was the worst curry I've ever tasted.  Dessert: Fried Banana Wonton. I'm pretty sure it's safe to say this was our favorite all-around dish of the night. The wonton was crispy and delicious. This was the first dish that brought a smile to my face. Still, I like my desserts simple, so if you're looking for refined and complex, this isn't it. It is delicious, though.  Overall, I thought the portion size was generous and the menu was intriguing, but the food just didn't follow through on flavor. Maybe going during restaurant week was a mistake since they were very busy.

2010-01-19,2.0,"A visit in Chicago and a search for a restaurant near my hotel on yelp lead me to Le Colonial. I'm not sure why I picked this place. I guess I was expecting it to be a mix between French and Vietnamese cuisine (like a fusion restaurant). It was a quick cab ride (5mins) to this joint. It was Friday night so the area was busy with lots of people walking around.  We were greeted by very cute hostess with a huge smile. After some small banter about the weather and nightlife, we were lead to our table. The décor of this restaurant was very soothing and relaxing due to the dim lighting, wicker and host of Vietnamese/French decorations.  It makes this place ideal for a romantic date-ish restaurant.  I open the menu to see what the restaurant would offer. Going through the menu, all I could think about is my mom.  I pictured her first almost having a heart attached due to the high prices (for Vietnamese food) then slapping me on the head for going to this restaurant then finally giving me a long lecture about how I should save money. I had to try to erase this mental picture so I order vodka on the rocks (total of 3 before we left).  I proceed to order the soup which was the Pho and Mi Xao Do Bien entrée. My date ordered the soup Sup Man Cua and Bo Sate entrée. The soups came out first and both were very small bowls with adequate taste and flavors. When my entrée came out, it seemed like the noodles were over cooked. I didn't finish my entrée because it just didn't taste great. I tried the Bo Sate and the meat was cooked perfectly but again it wasn't anything to go crazy over.  I was quite perplexed about the high rating of this restaurant. The food here is mediocre at best. In general, I was expecting more of a French style restaurant and for the price I was expecting even more from the food. If you're a connoisseur of Vietnamese food as I am (eaten it all my life with the combo of home cooking and eating out), I would NOT suggest you going to this place for the food. For the price of this dinner for two, I could have taken a family of 8 to your local Vietnamese restaurant for a feast and better food! This restaurant is more for your NOVICE Vietnamese food eater. The service was exceptional but that couldn't make up for the lack luster food. =(  I'll leave you with this ""GOooooooooooooooood Morning, Vietnam! Hey this is not a test! This is rock and roll!

2009-12-29,5.0,"Just to clear the air, I don't frequent these kinds of establishments that often.  This may make my opinion more on the novice end; however, for those of us bargain eaters, I'm certain you'll be able to identify.  I am the type of consumer who feels a greater sense of satisfaction when the delicious meal I devoured was ONLY $___ (insert some ridiculously low price).  Makes me feel like I've got a little secret that those fancy pants counterparts know nothing about.   Yet, here we were... My sweetheart and I.  At a $$$ restaurant, a little out of sorts for us simple folks.  I was certainly transported to a different time and era.  The big plants and lazily spinning fans created a certain aura.  The restaurant was fairly busy, but thanks to reservations we were seated promptly at a window table as our hostess wished us a happy anniversary.  Although, I am unaccustomed to 1) pricier menus and 2) such romantic settings, I was quite delighted - and I haven't even eaten yet! We perused the menu - I am always grateful when there are numbers next to dishes as I am an ignorant to the ways of how to pronounce Asian dishes outside those indigenous to my homeland.  We placed our order with our extremely attentive waiter - I noticed that they don't wear name tags... probably to avoid patrons, such as myself, calling out their names... or perhaps it is to reinforce the idea of a caste system that I'm sure existed in the colonized Vietnam, but I digress!  Our waiter, restated our order saying that there was a first, second, and third course.  Again, this vernacular, I am only  vaguely familiar with. We ordered pho (#11), chao tom (#4), banh uot (#8), tom chon ram (#9), ga xao cari (#31), and ga xao xa ot (#41).   ""First Course"" began with pho and chao tom.  Pho is a spicy soup with vermicelli noodles and it was absolutely delectable.  The soup itself had a slight kick to it, but did not over power the flavor of the meat (oxtail).    The banh uot is a MUST eat.  I was blown away with how the beef was delicately laced with sesame seasoning and ""oh"" so tender.  My mouth waters at the mere mention... Both dishes 5 *s in my humble opinion. ""Second Course"" consisted of chao tom and tom cuon ram.  This round was still good, but neither is something that I'd crave enough to repeat in the future.  The chao tom is an upscale lettuce wrap where shrimp skewered by sugar cane is laid upon noodles accented with cilantro/lime/carrots.  Perhaps my taste buds aren't sensitive enough, but I haven't the faintest idea what the sugar cane did for that shrimp.  The tom cuon ram was pretty good - these are spring rolls consisting of shrimp and chicken goodness fried with the shrimp tail used as a handle.   The ""third"" and final course? Ga xao xa ot and ga xao cari more fondly known as 31 and 41.  31 is a chicken dish with mushrooms - delicious again!  I don't know how they got the chicken so tender and so smoked with flavor, but instead of postulating as to how it is done I was just grateful that it was done this way.  41 is a light curry with chicken, mango, and eggplant.  Certainly different from its Indian cousin, but still very flavorful. After each course, they clear your entire table.  I almost stopped the waiter as he took my plate which still had my utensils on it.  Luckily, my quizzical expression as he pulled everything away was replaced with relief when the waiter returned with entirely new place settings.  Like I said, this was a new experience for me.  Normally, you can get me a Big Mac and would have won me over.  Overall, this high class experience was definitely enjoyable =)",0.9987,0.816,0.169,0.015,0.5454485164759136

2009-12-28,5.0,"So one thing I don't do is spend money on lavish restaurants. Why spend $75 on a meal for two when you can spend $20 and pick up a pair of Levi's 514s ($32.99 Levi's sale at Kohl's today 12/28/09 btw)? Therefore, it usually takes a special occasion to get me to go to a place like Le Colonial. A lot of places create the ambience but don't have the quality of food to back it up - see Sushisamba Rio. Instead, Le Colonial transports you to French colonized Vietnam and has the culinary experience to match.  The place is uber romantic - the best I can describe is a low key dimly lit Rick's Café in Casablanca. The place definitely has the French feel, wicker accents and palm leafed plants. We tried six different items - thankfully they have special tasting portions of their entrees for $10 on every Sunday of the month, albeit I'm not sure it is an ongoing deal. For starters, we tried the Pho, Chao Tom, Banh Uot, Tom Cuon Ram. For the entrees, we tried the Ga Xao Xa Ot and Ga Xao Cari. Pho (Oxtail soup) - This tasted extremely authentic. The meat was tender and the broth was delicious. Argyle approved. Chao Tom (Sugercane Grilled Shrimp Lettuce Wraps) - With all the hype regarding this dish, it somewhat disappointed. The grilled shrimp comes wrapped around a stick of sugarcane, which you have to remove before eating. It was good but it left me wondering what the sugarcane had to do with the dish at all. Banh Uot (Sesame Beef in Steamed Flat Rice Noodle) - This had the 'Wow"" factor. The Sesame beef was perfectly flavored and the garnishes made the dish complete.This is a must. Tom Cuon Ram (Shrimp and Chicken Fried Spring Rolls) - The sauce here makes the dish - it had some hints of orange peel, maybe a little ginger? They are reminiscent of fried shrimp spring rolls at Thai Restaurants but are triangle shaped instead. Ga Xao Xa Ot (Lemongrass Chicken over Portobello mushrooms) - This is another must. Perfect lemongrass seasoning and with a grilled smoky flavor.  Ga Xao Cari (Curry Chicken w/ Mango and Eggplant) - The curry sauce was lighter than Thai or Indian curry but it is also very good. The mango, yams, and eggplant felt like it should be part of the dish. Overall, the place is amazing and is a perfect setting for a special occasion. Total bill came out to $66. Of course the tasting menu hepled. Tip: When I reserved a seat on  opentable.com  I noted in the 'Special Requests to the Maitre'D' that it was my girlfiend and I's anniversary. They remembered by greeting us about the occasion upon arriving and led us to a reserved window seat. Nice touch! p.s. You know you're not used to fine dining when 1st, 2nd, and 3rd courses don't mean anything to you. When they first took our plates away after the first course, we were a second away from screaming, ""Wait, don't we need our silverware?""

We ordered some spring rolls with lettuce which were okay, not the best I've had. We ordered this other filet mignon appetizer, which my fiance prefered, I was also okay about it. The main entree was a sweeter noodle dish with a bunch of seafood that we shared because it was a huge portion which was also okay.

The temperature, the place, the time. It has been said times and times again but as soon as you push the door you find yourself transported in Saigon circa 1920. I fell in love with Vietnam through the screen; the movie 'Indochine' (a French one, and kinda of a chick flick even though it's supposed to be historical) showed off the country in the most beautiful way - and I discovered the Halong Bay.

I ordered their seafood dish in oyster sauce and found it to be rather bland. My wife ordered another seafood dish in chili sauce and found it to be too oily. We enjoyed the salad rolls appetizer but overall the place was too crowded. The waiter wasn't at all attentive and the staff including the host have a snobby attitude. That was especially noticeable from the staff upstairs especially the bartender. I was seated right next to a column and was hit no less than 4 times by staff who were walking past from the kitchen. I would go to Trader Vics or Roys before returning to this place. To enjoy this place you probably have to have the soup or something with curry flavor to really get the Asian taste. I would also say that you probably will appreciate the decor better during the day rather than at night time.

Only negative - the smart-ass waiter (not ours) who, when in desperation I asked him why it's been 7-8 minutes since the server had taken my snapper to be deboned (at his suggestion), leaving my wife to watch her meal get cold, said smugly and with no effort to find out what was happening, ""I'm sure it's almost ready."" Nice blow off, jerk. But every other aspect of the service was fine - I'll just be sure to avoid this guy's tables on future visits.  The décor has a great classical Vietnam style to it. Long established restaurants in old spaces can have their own style and vibes, which Le Colonial definitely does. It's a nice feeling, classy but inviting. Somewhat like the better New Orleans restaurants.  Some Yelpers have said they love the upstairs, some the downstairs. We were in the bigger room, the downstairs one, and it was fine. The upstairs area is clearly more intimate, but I think we'd be happy either way. And the bar area looks inviting to come back just for cocktails.  We shared two appetizers: Tom Cuon Ram: crisp beignets stuffed with shrimp, chicken, vegetables, and an orange ginger dipping sauce, and Banh Cuon: steamed Vietnamese ravioli of chicken and crimini mushrooms, in flat rice noodles with lime garlic sauce. The ravioli was unique, soft- as rice noodles always are, very Asian tasting. And full of flavor. It'll be hard to pass the ravioli on future visits. For my main course, I had the Ca Chien Saigon: a crisp, seared whole red snapper with a light, spicy-sour sauce. It was delicious, moist and tender, just the way great fish should taste, with the extra kick that comes from Asian spices.  All the food was wonderful. Wine selection was good.

The main dishes were still good, mine, with chicken, was  solid but not too extraordinary, the seafood my companions had was better.  What I disliked was the bottle of pleasant but rather mediocre wine they sold for 60$ - definitely overpriced. Without tips, the final bill showed 220 $ - pretty hefty, I think, considering that one can probably have slightly less exclusive but similarily tasty food at a more low-key BYOB Vietnamese place (somewhere around Argyle) with better wine for about half the price, without an arrogant maitre d' and lights being dimmed so low you can barely see your friends at the table...

2009-08-17,4.0,"I went to Le Colonial for a dinner date and I was reasonably pleased with the restaurant selection. This place has a very quaint touch to it, high ceilings with ceiling fans, huge fake windows and a tree right in the middle of the dining hall. The lights are very dim and does make this a romantic setting, however, the proximity of tables to each other is very close and often intrudes into your privacy. You do get used to it after a while though, just make sure not to talk very loud. I would give the service a 4/5 over all. Although its a French-Vietnamese restaurant, the menu is 90% Vietnamese, though not all of it seemed authentic. I went on a Sunday and they had a Sunday Sampler Menu with 5 of their popular entrees available in a sampler size (1/2 plate) for only $10 (compared to the usual $20-30). For the two of us, we ordered one appetizer (the Vietnamese Ravioli - I def. recommend it) and ordered two samplers (Basil Chicken in Lemongrass - again, really good and the diced Filet Mignon with Yams which was decent as well). The food was more than enough for the two of us, we didn't even end up finishing it. They have a fairly good wine list, the cheapest glass was about $8-10 and cheapest bottle was $60ish I think.

2009-07-04,4.0,"All in all, a very interesting concept reflects the history of what was once French Indochina, even if if the perspective is rather class based and somewhat myopic. Nevertheless, the food is excellent, the décour interesting, and the service outstanding. Food: This place has some really interesting items on the menu, and for that they get credit. I've been here a few times and anything with beef is exceptional - it's not a steakhouse, but they cook beef well here. The sauces are rich and alive with complex and complimenting sweet and savory flavors. The one bad experience I had here was ordering the duck with the tamarind sauce (there was more to it but I don't remember). The duck was too gamey and dry; in a word, it was overcooked. It's a shame because I love duck. You might have better luck with that dish; I tried it only once, and it might have been an off night. It's a shame I don't eat seafood, b/c most of the really interesting dishes had fish or seafood - not surprising since it's, in essence a Vietnamese place. Ambiance: Very cool. I love the faux antique, irregular looking chopsticks. I mean, I usually don't ramble on about the décour (I save that for the food), and I won't here. Suffice it to say that the place has taste, which I do appreciate.  Service: Excellent and what you would expect at a place like this.  Great place all in all. I deduct a star because of my unfortunate duck experience and, in general, I have a hard time giving expensive places 5 stars. Don't get me wrong, it can happen (i.e. Alinea), however, it's easy to have a great meal when you're paying $40+ per person. As unfair as it sounds, the expensive places need to show me something intangible.

We had a lovely patio table and started out with cocktails. I had the framboise limonade (their version of raspberry lemonade, with limoncello and many other ingredients).  Strong, but nice and light.  My other cocktail of the evening was the lychee margarita.  Also light and delicious.  Two drinks was enough, they packed a punch.  I also tasted the Lychee Sangria, which was a good choice as well. We shared a few appetizers, I believe they were the Bo Bia, Banh Uot, and Goi Ngo Sen.  Everything was spot on, and filled me up.  Yet somehow I managed to make my way through part of the Ca Hap (sea bass), but still have enough for a large lunch tomorrow.  It was lovely, flaky, delicious.  One of my companions had the red snapper which was fabulous as well, I would probably order that next time. My friend had a tofu dish which I did not try but looked good and she seemed to enjoy.  Although we were stuffed, we somehow found room to split desserts.  My friend had the mango sundae, and I had the banana wonton with creme anglaise and dark chocolate sauce.  Mmmmmm mmmm good.

2009-03-01,3.0,"i've said it before, and i'll say it again, if you're going to charge high end prices, you better be delivering high end food and high end service. we made reservations for 9pm on a tuesday, arrived a bit early and grabbed drinks at the bar. a gin/tonic and a vodka/tonic totaled $21. after we were seated we were given 2 menus (one for restaurant week and the regular menu). the restaurant week menu was a prix fixe, pared down version of the original that included a first and second course followed by desert and coffee. i decided to go with the restaurant week menu whilst my mans (not being big on dessert) ordered from the original. apps: the first course was the highlight of the meal for both of us. i had the banh cuon, a sort of chicken & mushroom ravioli in a garlic lime sauce. the flavors were complex and interesting with a subtle spice. quite nice. my mans had the crab and asparagus soup that was also quite good, but more subtle. entrées: all around, completely boring. we did the bbq pork with noodles and the lemongrass chicken with portobellos in a basil chili sauce. neither was very flavorful or interesting. the chicken basically amounted to a snoozy, chinese stir fry; the pork was slighly better but nowhere near the caliber of food i expect for $20/plate. dessert and coffee: my choice was between a variety of sorbets or ice cream. i chose the raspberry and mango sorbets and while they tasted great i'm nearly 90% sure they did not make them in house. service: fabulous! no, not really... its just that our server must have used that word at least 15 times throughout our meal. the service was actually fine up until the end. the patio was nearly empty and it was fairly clear that our server wanted to go home. the check was placed in front of me as soon as dessert was served, i paid, signed the receipt and while i was still finishing my dessert and coffee, our server came to ask if the check was all set for her. i said yes, she took it and and i never saw her again. i never had my plates cleared or my coffee refilled. once again, not the kind of service i expect when i'm spending so much money.",0.9863,0.87,0.11,0.021,0.5181175213675212
2009-02-27,4.0,"Le Colonial has a romantic ambiance.  It seemed like a good place to take a dinner or date or go with a small group of friends.  The atmosphere was pretty romantic and intimate though the restaurant was pretty crowded on the Saturday night that my boyfriend and I went. I actually liked the food that I ordered.  I had the Banh Uot (sesame beef rolls) appetizer, Tom Xao Sate (sautéed jumbo shrimp entrée), and the sorbet (for dessert).   The sesame beef rolls taste so good and were wrapped in flat noodles.  I became and immediate fan.  The sautéed jumbo shrimp was a little spicy (but I like it like that) and the asparagus in the dish contributed well to the robust flavor of the dish.  I was glad that they served Jasmine white rice with the entrees as it was perfect to top everything off.  The rice helped to balance off the spice and sauce of the sautéed jumbo shrimp dish.  I was VERY pleased with my meal.   My handsome dinner date on the other hand thought otherwise.  He ordered the Tom Cuon Ram (beignets) appetizer, Vit Quay (ginger marinated roast duck with tamarind dipping sauce), and vanilla bean ice cream for dessert.  Hot oil exploded out of the beignets which made the first bites unpleasant.  But after that, the beignets did taste good, but nothing too special about them.  He thought the roast duck (Vit Quay entrée) was also pretty mediocre.   I was disappointed that nothing more creative was served for dessert as part of the Restaurant Week pre-fixed menu.  Though the ice cream and sorbet tasted good, it would have been nice to have fancier options for dessert.   Service was average though.  Our waiter seemed aloof and insincere - just doing his job and nothing more.  The bussers and food runners even seemed a bit more personable.",0.9747,0.794,0.157,0.049,0.6683261183261183
2009-02-26,4.0,"So when you think of U.S. Marine war vets having a reunion, after not seeing each other for a few years,  I'm sure bottles of wine, dressing up and fine dining are not the first thing that comes to mind, but in true Erin P. style, it would be no other way, right? After finding out an old military buddy was in town for the week, I scrambled and made last minute restaurant week reservations, luckily Le Colonial could fit us in with one day's notice!  After reading about their upstairs bar, we coordinated meeting early to get pre dinner cocktails to begin the catching up/war stories/gossiping.  The bar was a little tight, but beautiful and dimly light.  Although not normally a ""fru fru"" drink kind of a girl, I opted to try one of their ginger martinis- it was pretty good, but on the sweet side.  My boyfriend got a martini with lemon cello, mint and ginger which was also tasty (sweet again, though).  Our friend had some really great wine from their by the glass menu.  Unfortunately the hostess did not come get us like she had promised when it was time for our reservation, so I eventually checked back and then we were seated right away. Its not like we really cared- we were in a bar, thus happy, I just wonder if they would have come to get us if I hadn't asked. . .  Dinner was fabulous!  While the dinning room is a beautiful as everyone has mentioned, it is a bit of a tight fit, especially if one of your guests looks like he plays for the Bears, but the owner/manager was very involved in walking around the room and making sure everyone was comfortable.  Service was great- there was absolutely no snobieness about ordering off the ""restaurant week menu""- in fact they have a weekly Wednesday night ""date night "" special anyway.  They were also very accommodating to my hatred of cilantro and offered to make all of my dishes without the vile herb.  For starters, two of us had the had the ravioli, which were three little pockets of heaven with basil on top, and one had the crab and shrimp croquets, which were fried bits of goodness with an amazing ginger sauce.  The Spanish blend bottle of wine we ordered went surprisingly well with the Vietnamese flavors.  For dinner I had the ginger duck with tamarind sauce- it was good but a little dry, although the skin and sauce were amazing!  My visiting friend had the duck as well and raved about it so, maybe his wasn't dry.  My boyfriend had the lemongrass chicken with sautéed portobello mushrooms- which was a very generous portion.  We were also given jasmine rice for the table.   Dessert was a two sorbets- the prefect refreshing dessert..  They have really great strong coffee too!  Excluding the pre-dinner drinks, the meal came to about $65 each, including tip, coffee and bottle of wine- not too shabby! Catching up with an old friend, over amazing food, great drinks and in a beautiful atmosphere, I could not have asked for a better night, it was also a perfect way to show a visitor a beautiful part of town.",0.9996,0.69,0.284,0.025,0.6175565175565175

After the dinner I talked to the same manager and he apologized that we had a bad experience and then had the nerve to say that next time we dine there we should ask for him personally, as if there would ever be a next time.

Since I am a picky eater I scoped out the menu ahead of time to get an idea of what I wanted. Service was pretty attentive.

I also had the peanut, jicama, and something else rolls with plum-peanut sauce. They were fine, but not remarkable. I went cheap ($6 for the soup and I think $8 or $9 for the rolls), but still didn't feel I got my money's worth.

For the appetizer we order the Pho which was absolutely delicious. Making it even better was that the kitchen without even asking split the soup into two bowls for us because the waiter knew that we were sharing.  Pho ain't easy to share otherwise!  We also order the Goi Ngo Sen which was a lotus root salad with fried tofu.  The salad was a huge hit and the portion was ginormous.  Our entre was the Bun Thit, which was a bed of rice noodles topped with barbecue pork. Once again Le Colonial delivered with a yummy well seasoned dish.  In addition to the above we also added a side order of Mien Xao which was glass noodles with crab meat and mushrooms. I wasn't a fan, but Audrey seemed to like it.  To finish off the lunch we had the Coconut & Mango Sorbets.  Yummy, but $7.00 for two scoops of Ciao Bella I thought was a bit steep. The interior is great!  Plenty of plants and tasteful color palette hammer home the French meets Vietnamese inspired motif.  The service was attentive and knowledgeable.  That's all that I ask.  I can't believe it took me almost 14 years to finally eat here.  My next visit will most definitely be much sooner. 1 Business Prixe Fix 1 Lotus Salad 1 Glass Noodle with Crab & Mushrooms 1 Sorbet 1 Mango Margarita ------------------------------------------------------- $70.00",0.9868,0.857,0.124,0.02,0.5054166666666666

2008-04-23,4.0,"I don't get out much. I mean, not to swanky places like Le Colonial, at least. But tonight? I was in Chicago for work, without the 3 yr. old in tow that usually keeps me from going to places like Le Colonial unless I've hired a babysitter, and I decided, what the hell. I'll splurge on calories and $. I'd been here before, but it was years ago (in the late 90s to be exact), while I was actually living in Chicago. My FAVORITE French/Vietnamese place was Pasteur (RIP), but Le Colonial was a close second. The restaurant itself is lovely. A very romantic, transporting setting. The service was very good (although, not great). And for a Wednesday night, this place was packed.  So on to the food: I was with two co-workers, and we started with the Bahn Cuon (steamed ravioli of chicken and crimini mushrooms, in flat rice noodles with lime garlic sauce), Tom Cuon Ram (shrimp/chicken beignets), and Banh Uot (grilled sesame beef rolls in flat rice noodles with cucumber, luettuce, basil and lime garlic sauce). Yum, yum, and freakin' yum. Everything smelled, looked and tasted phenomenal. And the rest of the appetizers on the menu sounded just as good as these three, so I don't think we just got lucky... Entrees: Tom Xao Sate (sauteed shrimp/asparagus), Bun Thit Nuong (bbq pork over angel-hair noodles) and Vit Quay (ginger marinated roast duck). Again, aside from the duck being a tad on the dry side, everything was bursting with flavor and absolutely gorgeous to behold. The portions were ample w/out being obnoxious.  And believe it or not, we ordered desert: A lemon tart with shortbread crust and a banana tapioca pudding. The tart was excellent--perfect texture and (no pun intended) tartness. The tapioca was okay, but was not a good consistency (too runny) and was less flavorful than the rest of the meal had been. I had a lemongrass martini that was also heavenly. Yes, it's pricey. But I'm willing to splurge on such wonderfully prepared and presented food.  The reason Le Colonial doesn't get 5 stars? The dining room is too crowded. The waitstaff and busboys were practically having to do Cirque de Soliel moves to keep from tripping over one another as they tended to customers and delivered food. The closeness of the tables is an unfortunate distraction to the otherwise beautiful atmosphere. I mean, if they removed even two of the smaller tables and rearranged things, it would be better. Also, our waiter was a bit absent at times. But perhaps he was in the back, practicing his contortionism/ninja skills so that he could get through the crowded dining room without bumping into anyone or anything. ------ Update: Oops! I TOTALLY forgot to write about the sides. Holy crap, I should be spanked for that omission. The three of us each ordered a side, however, we could've gotten away with ordering only 2 dishes, as they were ample servings. What we ordered: Ca Tim Nuong (grilled eggplant in a spicy basil lime sauce), Rau Xao (Stir-fried pea shoots in a light sauce w/garlic) and Mien Xao (celophane noodles w/crabmeat, tree ear mushrooms & cilantro). They were all fantastic, but the standouts were the noodles and the pea shoots. Seriously, don't skip out on these sides when you order.",0.9953,0.848,0.119,0.033,0.589017094017094

Located in a vintage rowhouse, Le Colonial immediately transports you back to 1920's southeast Asia.  With its uniquely tiled floors, louvered shutters, ceiling fans, rattan furniture and lush potted plants and banana trees- this place removes you from the day to day and transports you to a bit of fantasy.  There are even photos on the walls of 1920 Saigon (I asked!) to add to the fantasy of actually being in a different time.   If you can- try to sit upstairs- the large mahogany bar, oriental rugs and overstuffed sofas in the lounge add to the intimacy of the place. But the real winner here is the food.  While French Vietnamese fare sounds odd to me (I love French food yet real Vietnamese food leaves me a bit cold) the food is very good.  Do what we did and order a variety of things to share. We started with the crab meat soup with herbs and asparagus (delicious) marinated tuna with tomato, cilantro and cucumber (my favorite) and the grilled shrimp wrapped around sugar cane.  Very good. Next for the entrees- we had the sea bass with cellophane noodles and vegetables, the rack of lamb, and as a side the fried rice with shrimp and vegetables.  Way too much food but all of it was delicious. The service was attentive without being pushy and there was never a pause to answer our every question.  As for cocktails- I stuck with my tried and true dirty martini but my friend had a ""saketini"" (in fact he had several!) and he declared his the overall winner- I am still undecided about that but both were good!

Btw, I'd recommend sitting upstairs, which is quite a bit more intimate than downstairs (although we ended up sitting on the terrace, which may not have been the best choice).

Our waitress was very helpful in recommending what to order. We shared: - the seared monk-fish with sesame crackers (appetizer): this was very good, and I really enjoyed the crackers. I wish the portion had been a little larger. - the grilled sesame beef rolls in rice noodles (appetizer): just delicious (and that's coming from someone who does not normally eat beef). - the sauteed jumbo shrimp with asparagus: very good, but could have been a little more original. - the bbq duck: prepared Peking style. It was very good also, if a little dry. We also were going to get a side dish of pea shoots, but they forgot to bring it to us... which was probably a good thing because we had plenty of food without it.

We got seating at 9pm as was our last minute reservation. We had an awesome table near the window where I could see my former employer from long ago - starbucks! The appetizers were really good - the monkfish with sesame crackers was soooo good! 5 stars basically for that. It tasted so freshly made and so delicious.  Boyfriend had soup with asparagus and that was tasty too.  The main dishes I have to agree - double the price for something that you can get cheaper at an actual Vietnamese restaurant. Though the sea bass was good and yummy with glass noodles, my chicken dish was just ordinary. it  had a kick to it with chilli but not too amazing.

2007-01-11,4.0,"I've been to the Le Colonial in San Francisco a few times and loved it, so when I moved to Chicago I was thrilled to see they have a location here as well. The food is fresh, inventive and beautifully prepared. Le Colonial was my first experience with French Vietnamese food and I absolutely love all the unique flavor combinations they put together.  The restaurant is divided into two floors. The downstairs is a more formal dining room and the decor reminds me of Casablanca - lots of orchids and ceiling fans. It's very peaceful, for lack of a better word. The upstairs is more of a lounge - there's a bar and comfy couches for having a pre- or post-dinner cocktail. It's very dimly lit with lots of candles and smaller tables, as well as a sort of covered patio. They serve food upstairs, but I really prefer to eat downstairs and then have a drink upstairs afterwards. All in all, this place is great for a romantic meal or for out-of-town guests, as well as a nice place to stop in for cocktails (all of their specialty drinks are delicious and pack a punch) before a night out in the Gold Coast.",0.986,0.788,0.19,0.022,0.6087301587301587

I'd go to restaurants on Argyle for cheaper(yet good) Vietnamese food if I wanted only Vietnamese. The place is really crowded. They jammed in too many tables and chairs, I kept elbowing a person sitting at the next table.",-0.0644,0.914,0.041,0.045,0.47000000000000003

2006-12-05,4.0,quality food- fresh and abundant and worth what you pay for just because they throw-in so much shrimp or beef to the dishes.. the taste and presentation isn't all that great though. you would expect so much more from it just by looking at the cute rush street setting. the vietnamese and french colonial motive is very trendy. romantic.,0.6688,0.781,0.15,0.069,0.55
2006-11-08,4.0,Visiting from LA we bumped into Le Colonial while strolling down Rush St. Ended up sitting outside  in the cute patio since it was a crisp September day and enjoying a very pleasant lunch. All the dishes we ordered exceeded our expectations. I had never had French-Vietnamese fusion before but loved the marriage of the two and how the flavors of each cuisine complemented the other.

2006-10-26,4.0,"Other reviewers have it right.  I like it upstairs here- it's a great spot for a drink and appetizer date.  And I generally hate ""upstairs"" lounge hangout places, but this place doesn't irritate me like most- maybe because the space itself is nice, and doesn't rely solely on people watching. Nobody else has mentioned it, but this place is a chain- there's one in San Fransisco as well as New York too.  I generally avoid national restaurants, but this place's atmosphere just gets it right.  I wouldn't go out of my way to get here, but this is my favorite low-key spot to ""get away"" when I have to come to this neighborhood for other reasons.",0.9408,0.792,0.167,0.041,0.629634002361275

That said, the dishes at Le Colonial are light and refreshing.  I don't know that I'd say that anything I had was amazing.  The food is very fresh and delicious.  For dinner I had the beef salad.  It was very good, filled with basil, lemongrass and with a delicious chili lime vinaigrette.   People say this is an expensive meal, and I agree that it isn't cheap, but I think the price is well worth it.  Fresh ingredients prepared well is worth the cost, I think.  And, for 3 appetizers, one main course and dessert, $55 wasn't too bad!",0.9849,0.741,0.259,0.0,0.6896296296296296
