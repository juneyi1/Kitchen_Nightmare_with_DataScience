I had ordered the Chicken Lemon (Leh-moan), which consisted of two pieces of chicken smothered in a lemon wine sauce accompanied with a small bowl of rigatoni pasta. My oh my was it heavenly. Due to the amount of people that were in attendance for the festival, the service was much slower and poor unfortunately, but I understood the circumstances. The prices are a bit higher than most Italian restaurants (my entree was $17) but the quality is outstanding.

2017-08-06,3.0,"We have seen ads about Mart Anthony's and decided to give it a try.  The restaurant is actually in a very quiet area on Hubbard and parking can be tricky.   We found there is plenty of parking 1 block south of the restaurant but we later learned they offer complimentary valet service too.   Service - Excellent!  We met the owner and he was super friendly and inviting. Our waiter was likewise very friendly and efficient.   Atmosphere - The interior is quite dated but it was obvious there are tons of regulars because it is really like a neighborhood bar.  There isn't a tremendous amount of seating inside but the patio is lovely because the area is so quiet.  You can also get a glimpse of the city if seated at the right table.   Food - The presentation certainly looked impressive and the entrees were very generous but we found the flavors for a few items certainly not what we expected.  Grilled Shrimp and Calamari - very generous portion but it was served in a large amount of reddish sauce that looked like chili sauce.  The seafood was very tender but we were a little thrown off.  Good thing we like spicy food because it had a little kick to it. Cesar Salad - Typical salad...nothing remarkable.  Black Linguine In a vodka sauce with Shrimp & Scallops- had generous amounts of seafood that was very tender but the pasta was overcooked and the sauce too thick and creamy for my liking. The pasta was all stuck together. White Fish Vesuvio was sautéed in garlic, white wine & spices, served over cappellini.  It was a huge portion and delicious.  The pasta was cooked just right and the fish was very fresh.  Definitely the best entree we selected.   We would definitely give Mart's another try because we love family owned businesses and their hospitality can't be beat.",0.9989,0.688,0.297,0.015,0.5021130952380953

Some pieces were charred and the sauce that they use is not marinara, but it tasted very close to a mole sauce (pronounced mo-le, which is a Mexican thick sauce). The sauce wasn't bad;however, we were expecting a homemade marinara sauce with it...I had the lobster ravioli which was the most delicious from both our entres. My husband had the shrimp diavolo, which he said came out too salty and they threw in 5 of the smallest shrimp they could find. It wasn't worth the price.

The restaurant would probably not have made it onto my radar if not for a buddy, who walks past it regularly on his way to work, suggesting we try it out for dinner. This unassuming neighborhood joint, with its subdued signage and location on a quiet section of Hubbard Street, could easily be missed.  The restaurant maintains an old-school Italian vibe. The wood panel walls are adorned with black and white photographs of some famous and some not-so-famous people.  The menu is packed with traditional Italian fare, the portions of most of which are very generous. The Black Linguini with shrimp and scallops and the Chicken Vesuvio were both difficult to finish in one sitting.  Polishing off the Lobster Ravioli, with chunks of lobster in it, posed no such problem for me. The prices for the food and drinks are reasonable. The offering of beers is displayed above the bar. As with any good Italian restaurant, Mart Anthony's maintains a decent wine selection. Ever since the surrounding streets became permit only, parking in the area is difficult.  Luckily, Mart Anthony's offers a free valet service. You'd be wise to use this amenity as the parking police in the neighborhood is very quick to ticket.

They use sandwich wrapping paper for table cloth. The waiter was also the host and the busser.  They redeem the Groupon right away before ordering. Then, they tell you that Groupon gets special pricing. For example, a $32 bottle of Chianti all of sudden costs $47. So the $30 dollars are designated for wine can only be used towards Coastal Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon which sells for $4.99 at 711 and gas stations.  OK... The appetizer. Grilled calamari and shrimp. No details. Sounds good, right? No. The calamari and 4 small shrimps were baked, not grilled and they were doused in a disgusting red sauce. My girlfriend asked the waiter about it, he said he doesn't know, it's just what the 'chef' concocted. Onto entrées. She ordered linguine and I ordered Veal Saltimbocca. The linguine was once again doused in a strange sauce that wasn't on the menu. The Veal on the other hand was drier than beef jerky, and it came with pasta that looks and tastes like it was cooked by a 7 year old. 'check pics, it's hilarious'.  The owner was getting drunk at the bar while watching ESPN. When my girlfriend politely informed him of what has been happening, he rudely shrugged her off saying that it's a Chicago thing, insinuating that she's clueless because she's a tourist.

They warned as well as the reviews that it was smoky and they were right. It was good, maybe slightly overwhelming on the smoke, but after adding some lemon we really enjoyed it. The bartender was great and friendly. For our take out pastas we had a rigatoni arrabiatta and a tortellini Romano in a pink cream sauce Both were good. Not fantastic, nothing we would rave about, but solid. The pasta was cooked well and the sauces seasoned well.  I felt they were a little expensive given that it wasn't homemade pasta or anything spectacular but again, no real complaints on flavor.  Last night we did a take out order with a Groupon we purchased. We ordered a meatball, antipasto salad, and cavatelli. The salad was good, it was your typical antipasto salad. The meatball didn't impress, it just didn't have any flavor that stood out, but here is where the rating went down...the cavatelli...was total mush!  I think it was probably too mushy even for a toddler. I don't think I have had pasta that overlooked before let alone for a $14 charge.

Our server Juan came to greet our table and shortly after finding out that we had a Groupon, his service changed drastically. He didn't explain the menu, he only told us what our options were for the Groupon (which we knew already), and didn't make any recommendations. He didn't serve us our appetizers nor our entrees,  but only served the wine. When asked to obtain the WiFi password, he told us to ""enjoy the moment"" (was that a no?). He only checked on our table less than 5 times and was more friendly to the other tables. The server assistant was more attentive than our own server (tipped him $10). When the check came he made an open liquor of $40 and while our Groupon said the wine would need to be a $30 value (Reisling $36), the difference would be $4; he corrected that. Due to Juan service we did not leave him the best of tip,  but while signing the check he came to our table while we were still seated to see if he could take the check and as soon as we left and barely turned the corner, he went to grab it and made a smart remark about his tip. I hope the server assistant throw it in his face of the $10 he received. IF you do go and you get Juan maybe you'll have a better experience than we did.

I expected this place to be an hidden Italian  gem but it was not. The shrimp and calamari app. Was cooked well but the sauce was a bit too smokey. I haven't ever tasted a smokey sauce in calamari, goal figure. Then I went with the chicken saltimbocca and my date had the braciole (pronounce Bra-cole). We were assured that these were two of the best items on the menu; both came with a side of pasta as well. Well, my date's braciole  was extremely salty. I don't know if it was the kind of meats in it or maybe just their recipe. My chicken saltimbocca was fine. Not salty, not cooked bad, just fine.

I don't know why I ever kept going back because it is very over-priced. 2 glasses of wine and 2 pasta dishes, $65+ dollars every time. But it's walking distance from my house so I always put up with it. One time I called to see how busy they were on a Saturday night and they were ""already closing down"" at 9:15pm. What a joke. Saturday night!! Pitiful. Another time my BF ordered to go on a Sunday night and when I went in to pick it up the bill said $75. I was SHOCKED but figured my BF over did it when ordering. NOPE--got home and checked; they forget both our salads and charged us $75 for two fettuccine alfredos. They also forgot the chicken and shrimp on one and the chicken on the other. When we called back they said they had to call their kitchen girl to see what happened because she had already left. When they did call us back they said they forgot the salads but were ""positive there was chicken and shrimp on the pasta"" but there definitelty was not. They said would discount my card $20 (STILL NOT WORTH $55 IN PASTA DISHES). And 2 weeks later, here I am, still no refund on my credit card. I will never go back here.

We order our appetizer and we got our wine and bread. After a while, we noticed all tables around us, that were seated after us, were getting their food. My husband ordered a beer and the waiter said it was going to be on the house since the food was taking long. Our appetizer came an hour after we ordered.   We got the grilled calamari and shrimp and it was good. Our entrees were in the same fashion. We kept asking the waiter where is our food. He would claim that the official chef is off so it's crazy, however everyone else around us got their dishes quickly. He came he ask what was my order again. So frustrating and all they would bring us is more bread. By the time our food got there more than an hour, I was not hungry anymore. We got there at 6:30 and left 9:30 full of bread, wine and beer. And there was no beer on the house like the waiter said. Food might be great like ppl say but we were treated like they were doing favor for us.

I've been coming here for a few years. Have tried several of the pasta dishes, and my favorite is the lobster ravioli with a rich vodka sauce. Yummy!  When I have a taste for meat, I order the braciole because most restaurants don't offer it any more... too labor intensive. And if I'm in a low carb mood (difficulty zipping my jeans), nothing beats the grilled calamari.   The service is efficient without being intruisive. My water glass and coffee cup never seems to be more than half empty. Dinner plates are not cleared until everyone at the table has finished. (It really bugs me when they take my plate away while companions are still eating.) The place isn't very big, and there can be a wait, especially on weekends. Best to have a reservation.

We couldn't even eat half of it it was SO much food but it was very delicious. We got the stuffed artichoke appetizer (based on yelp reviews)...i wish we had chosen something else.

I started with the grilled calamari based on the reviews I saw on Yelp.  I really liked it.  The sauce is not your typical marinara.  It has a smokey characteristic that I think is the result of paprika.  It's pleasantly spicy and really flavorful.  It's a large portion that can easily be shared by several people.  I ate the entire order and honestly did not need the entree I ordered :)  The lasagna arrived, smothered in sauce and packed full of meat and cheese...delicious!  I only had room for a few bites and had the rest packaged to go.  I looked around the dining room at the other dishes being served and everything looked fantastic.  Sitting at the bar makes for a bit of a wait because the bartender is pretty slammed making drinks but this is to be expected on a Saturday night. The wine list is a little thin.  Not too many Italian choices by the glass.  They seem to serve a lot of vodka looking cocktails which are not my cup of tea so more wine choices would be a nice improvement but all-in-all this place is a keeper.  I will be heading back again very soon and look forward to trying some of the other fantastic looking selections.

2015-03-04,4.0,"Jumping right in with the food. Amazing - grilled calamari and shrimp appetizer hands down best I've had. Great peppery sauce.  They have a great menu with a range of Italian classics and some surprises.  I ordered off of the ""specials"" menu; a crab stuffed gnocchi in vodka sauce - fantastic and clearly home made; could detect a hint of crab but it was rather mild - would have like a bit more meat in there or some in the sauce. Still, the gnocchi were pillowy and delicious.  My wife had the Fettuccini Carbonara with shrimp added. Several shrimp cooked perfectly and a great portion of pasta.  Wine list is OK; not huge and perhaps a bit pricey - I think least expensive bottle was $32 - but I'm not much of a connoisseur.  I might go with cocktails next time.  I noticed the steaks were on the pricey side too, but if they match the downtown steakhouses, they may be worth it. Based on the food we had I'd expect they would.   The atmosphere is fantastic. Not huge but not cramped; cozy and warm.  Nicer than a corner pizza & pasta place, by far, but not overly formal either -  you'd be comfortable here either way in jeans or a suit. The walls covered in photos of patrons, famous people, Sinatra records, etc.  Everything you might imagine in a nice neighborhood Italian joint; Half expect to see the Rat Pack casually dining at a back table. We came with a groupon that had a few limitations, and they had no problems (some places, I've found have lesser service when you present them with such a coupon - Mart Anthony's did not do this! Great service!) and we bought an additional bottle of wine.  Overall a great experience; the food was amazing. I'd definitely go back and would bring some friends.

We drove a bit, trying to pick ""plan B"", when I remembered seeing Mart Anthony on Chicago's Best. We were delighted to see the complimentary valet service.  One reason we hadn't gone sooner was fear of unavailable parking. We were greeted and seated immediately on a Saturday night. There's some street side tables available for al fresco dining, but we stayed inside. The place is an old school charmer with a long bar and hardwood floors.  Immaculate, lots of pictures on the wall, with a section devoted to Sinatra. The atmosphere is laid back. Nice! The wine list was adequate, we enjoyed a bottle of pinot grigio. Refreshing! Service was casual, friendly, and attentive without being intrusive. Spiro and his helpers did a great job! Owner Marty stops table side to greet his guests, which is a nice touch! Caprese salad was good, served on a bed of iceberg lettuce. Chicken Vesuvio was simple and tasty. Ditto for the lemon chicken.  Nicely done. Limoncello sorbetto and a couple of decafs capped off the meal. Prices were reasonable, portions generous.

It's close enough to my own neighborhood (Ukrainian Village), so the drive was cake. This is a far cry from commercialized and a quintessential family-run, classic Italian restaurant. That's why I liked it so much!  After trying the black lingini di mare at Siena Tavern, I had to try it here. They do it just as good here as Fabio Viviani does it in River North, but for about $5 cheaper - AND with a groupon! At Mart Anthony's you get all different sorts of seafood, not just lobster. Props! The seating inside was intimate and the noise levels were minimum, as many families and couples were trying to emulate that same intimate experience my date and me were. The ambience is definitely awesome!  The wine and cocktails were just ok - come for the food.

It's old school Italian, dark, old, and with the kind of large menu you'd expect with all types of pasta and all types of other dishes coming with a side of pasta.  There was two of us with a large amount of money to spend to use the groupon so we sat down for a feast. First of all, the meal comes with bread- I love a restaurant that serves hot crusty bread and butter with your waters, though my waistline hates it. Eating the bread didn't give me enough of a guilt trip, apparently, because we ordered the cheesy garlic bread and the stuffed artichoke, which is stuffed with breadcrumbs. I ate all of my half of the garlic bread, so I clearly enjoyed it, but it's hard to go wrong with buttery garlic bread covered in cheese. The artichoke was just ok for me, but my friend loved it. For my entree, I ordered the stuffed gnocchi, which were large pillows filled with spinach and ricotta in a spicy sauce. They were tender and delicious and I looked forward to eating my other half later that week, as the portion was large. My friend ordered the chicken marsala, which comes with a side of pasta, and enjoyed her meal as well, taking half of it home. We ordered a tiramisu to share for dessert, and it was just ok. I've had better. I like my tiramisu soaked with a coffee liquer flavor and this one just tasted of sweet cheese. We finished it off anyway- who can complain about sweet cheese? Sure, I'd come back if I'm craving another enormous authentic italian dinner, but it won't be anytime soon.

We had baked claims and fried calamari which were both perfectly cooked and reminded me of the old Como Inn. For main courses- I had Veal Malanese which was pounded thin and very delicious with fresh brocoli & cottage fries. My wife had Veal Marsala with a side of pasta that she said was excellent and my daughter tried the escarole, beans & sausage that she said was one of the best ever. For desert we had a piece of canoli cake from a local bakery. This was such a nice evening and the food, wine and service couldn't have been a better experience.

The waiter came by almost immediately and took out drink orders and brought waters (a great sign of good service).  As an appetizer we got the stuffed artichoke which was terrific! Not only was it  delicious, but it was hands on as well. You have to manually pick off the scaly leaves that are filled with stuffing and garlic and butter. For meals I got the lamb chops which were perfectly cooked and came with a wonderful savory sauce that paired perfectly. My friend got the veal parmesan which was a huge slate like portion of veal lightly breaded and covered with mozzy cheese!  The wait staff was spot on. Our waiter knew it was our first time and had great suggestions and wine pairing ideas. The service was that kind where you know they are keeping your water glass topped and dirty dishes out of the way but they are never intrusive which is perfect. Also, whom I can only assume was the owner, would make his rounds to his regulars and socialize and entertain throughout the restaurant which really shows that he was enjoying what he does and strives for the happy customer.

Service: excellent. Just attentive enough to not be intrusive. (happens to be my preferred level, by the way) Food: delicious, high quality, but hearty and generous. You won't walk away hungry, and you will most likely enjoy experimenting by ordering something you may have never tried before, even though there's plenty of stand-bys and specials. If there are some regrets, it might be that you can only eat so much/order so much, meaning you'll have to come back to try the other thing or re-order what you liked last time if you don't order it again this time. Prices: reasonable. It helps that this place is not in the heart of the Loop. But if you have to be near the United Center, it's a great option. I'm happy enough to drive there from a half hour away. If you know people that are carless and in the Loop, you can easily swing by in your car, pick them up, take them there, and it's a quick trip. Practically free valet service is a major plus (you DO need to tip the valet, who's very friendly and professional even if he does technically not get paid by you).

We both had a glass of wine.  Their wines are always good and a generous pour.  Our server seemed exhausted so she was a little off on the attentiveness.  For example we knew what we wanted and indicated that by closing the menus but she only took the drink order to start.  Its ok b/c we like hanging out here.  The bread is always solid.  Then we tried the grilled calamari which had a symbol by it indicating that its a house specialty.  I over heard our waitress talking to the table next to us that the sauce was great.  We get the plate and its shocking.  The menu doesn't describe a sauce or anything so really I was expecting the usual small pile of grilled meat, slice of lemon, and some sauce in a cup - since we're at an italian place I suspect marinara.  Not the case.  It was a large amount of meat covered in what I thought was a mole sauce.  It was spicy and that reddish brownish color.  We didn't like anything about it.  The meat was obviously cooked a long time ago and reheated (we suspect microwave since the plate is hot and its only hot in the middle) I wish they had warned me b/c it was too spicy for me.  I can't say cooked perfectly but it wasn't chewy so that's good.  We left a lot of it at the restaurant. I had the risotto special with shrimp and scallops and a lemon sauce.  To me it was rice and not a true risotto.  It didn't have the right consistency (to me). The flavor was nice but nothing memorable.  My boyfriend had the chicken Siciliano - it was very saucy!!  He said it was just ok too.  We struck out for the 2nd time on dessert.  When we were here with a group on a sunday night in Feb they had limited desserts.  Again there was a choice of a cannoli or spumoni.  We had spumoni which was a little burned,,,very small serving and kind of a weird consistency.  I'm sure they didn't make it there. But we will be back b/c its like an old friend.  We forgive!",0.9789,0.818,0.118,0.064,0.5177473826409995

It was spicy, a good-sized portion, and there was a lot of shrimp in it. My boyfriend has the chicken marsala. He said it was good, but not the best he'd had.

If you are ok with that, then go ahead and dine here. If not? Go somewhere else. Here were the 3 issues when you first walk in: 1) No hostess stand or greeter. Just walk in and are standing in a pack of other patrons looking around waiting to be greeted. Shoulder to shoulder and the door open straight to the elements so you get a nice blast of cold air every time a new person comes in. 5 minutes went by before an older gentleman walked up and kind of took a head count of who was waiting from memory. My date mentioned we had a reservation, but this made no matter.  2) There is no reservation book! How do I know this? He didn't ask our name or our time. How can you take a reservation over the phone but not actually take it??  I'm ok with restaurants saying ""no reservations"". That way you are prepared to wait when you walk in. This restaurant will take a reservation aimlessly hoping you still come, wait an hour and order alcohol at the bar. Cheap ploy in my opinion. If you don't have tables avail, don't take a reservation!! Haha. Seems trivial but come on...we ended up eating at the bar after waiting 45 minutes after our scheduled reservation time. 3) So they offer free valet, but the valet guy doesn't have valet tickets, he just flashed his t-shirt and said it was his uncle's place and took my keys. A small but important detail considering valet tickets are how much to order for a business? Maybe 2 cents per card when ordered in bulk? How was the food? Good Italian. Tomato marinara sauce was delicious. The bartender (younger girl with dark hair) was very friendly. Good wine prices and pours. Good prices for food (Veal Parm was $24).  Ok, so again, if you are cool with no front-of-house organization and know it going in, this may be your spot. Unfortunately, with so many amazing restaurants in the city that take & hold reservations we won't come back. First impressions are everything.",0.9911,0.79,0.153,0.057,0.5141547049441786

The seating here is limited so I highly recommend having a reservation. The service was a bit slow but the place was packed and I swear the waiter had the whole place. That considered the service was very friendly and did a great job. For dinner we started with the antipasto. The antipasto had a generous amount of meats in it and the lettuce was very fresh. The dressing was also very good. I really enjoyed the Salami in it also. For dinner I split a large thin crust pizza with my mom. The pizza was served piping hot and I can tell it was made fresh and had a nice amount of cheese on it. The pizza was quite good. My dad had the brasual (excuse the spelling) and said it was also very good.  My boyfriend remembered that he had a  restaurant.com  coupon from 4 years ago and they still took it.

By the way the neighborhood is fine, and not dangerous like some others have mentioned.  Anyways, it was a busy night and the owner, who was great, helped us get a table very quickly.  After sitting for about 10 minutes our sever decided to help us out. No warm welcome, just a super quick ""Hello, what do you want to drink and are you ready to order?"" We were not ready with our food order, which was a bad idea, because he did not come back for at least another 10 mins.  When the food did come out it was lukewarm. Needing to wave down the server, because he never checked back with us, he was less than interested in the quality of the food and sent  a busser to take care of it.  Second try on the food only resulted in a slight increase in temperature. Who knows why the kitchen could not get the food to a proper serving temp.  Towards the end the server never asked if we would like another round of drinks, boxes for our food, or dessert. Once again I had to wave him down of the check in which he ran by our table at mach speed.  So a 10% tip was a bit much for the horrible service. Oh, he was very prompt in picking up that check presenter. To bad because most servers are great, and do a very difficult job very well.

2012-02-11,4.0,"We went here last night for our Valentine's Day weekend dinner. I was searching for an Italian place because that is something my boyfriend and I both enjoy. He is a pretty picky eater, so I really had to look at the menus closely to make sure there would be something there that he would like. This place wasn't too fancy, with food I had never heard of or didn't know how to pronounce. It was classic, rustic Italian food and it was Delicious! We started off with fried calamari. We get calamari at every restaurant we go to that offers it and this was some of the best! The calamari rings were huge! Plump and juicy. I have never bit into calamari and had juice dripping down my chin. It was definitely a good thing though. It was lightly battered and very crispy. I ordered the Tortellini Romano, which was tortellini filled with cheese in a creamy red sauce with prosciutto and mushrooms. It was very tasty. The tortellini was tender and the sauce was plentiful, but it wasn't too saucy. Just enough to coat the pasta as well as some extra left over to dip my bread in. My boyfriend ordered what he always does at Italian restaurants, Fettuccine Alfredo with grilled chicken. He also ordered a side of sauteed spinach and added that to his pasta. For just $5 he received a full plate of sauteed spinach. He didn't have real complaints about his dish, he did say it could use more seasoning though. The portions were very generous, which I love because I like having leftovers. The food came out rather quickly as well. We were pressed for time to get to our other engagement after dinner but were in and out within an hour.  The place was hoppin' for a Friday night. It's a very small place and every table was filled along with the seats at the bar. We had a reservation but were about 7 minutes late so two other parties went before us, but we were seated within 15-20 minutes. I don't know how well they honor reservations if you come on time though. Overall I enjoyed this place very much and would love to go again. It is slightly more expensive than what we would do on a regular basis but we definitely said we would get the calamari to go if we are every in that area and craving some wonderful fried calamari!

Safest bet is to ask your server and be guided by their recommendations. Mart Antony always has a specials menu of 8 or so options. I reco ordering from this menu to be safe.

2011-03-07,5.0,"First stop on a 22 restaurant tour (thanks  restaurant.com !) ... I would say this was an excellent experience overall, everything from the atmosphere to the service to the food itself. The entrance to the restaurant is very unassuming - in fact, it very much resembles a neighborhood bar. You could very easily walk by it without taking much notice. Enter through the front doorway and you are greeted by a very serene setting - think dimly lit room with very passive colors. The only thing which stood out was the Duke/UNC game playing on the two TVs at the bar. We were welcomed almost immediately by one of the bartenders/hostesses and seated at one of the open tables. We sat down to take in the setting and the menu, and the waiter was very patient with us. We started with a Fried Calamari and I ordered a glass of Robert Mondavi Private Selection Cabernet Sauvigon. The calamari came with a standard marinara sauce and was very good, although I think it is hard to mess up calamari. As a newbie to wines, I cannot comment extensively on the Cabernet Sauvigon other than to say it was very easy on the tastebuds and didn't have the same bitter edge I commonly taste with Reds. For my main entree, I ordered the Veal Saltimbocca and I am very glad I did. The veal was cooked to just the right degree and layered with Priscutto, spinach and mushrooms. While the sauce in which the dish lay was very watery, it was at the same time very flavorful so no complaints there.  Before I made it out of there, I had to order a desert. I went with the Chocolate Truffle and upon tasting it, I confirmed what I already knew was a good decision - a great way to end an already excellent meal. The outer shell of chocolate collapsed to expose an interior of chocolate ice cream. No issues processing the the gift certificate. Although there was a minor hitch of only accepting two credit cards per table, no stumbles in the night other than that. Five stars.",0.9749,0.81,0.126,0.064,0.4776567460317461

I new what my entree would be before I entered the restaurant: white fish vesuvio, which is what I always ordered and always loved.  The waiter said that they only had tilapia, and although tilapia is a white fish, it is not what they served in the past, but I tried it.  It wasn't terrible, but It was nothing like the vesuvio of the past.  It was pan-fried and had a hard shell.  So dissappointing!   My dining companion had the chicken saltimboca and enjoyed it.

As far as Marty's being authentic, delicious, fabulous etc. (which are qualities I happen to base my restaurant reviews on) - it really is all of these. I am 100% northern Italian and having had thousands of homemade Italian meals believe my opinion (and many others here) is solid.  Jeff - I am really happy you love Salerno's pizza. You can have that dump. As far as comparing it to Bella Notte and La Scarola, it is apples and oranges. In my opinion those two are just OK. Very oily, fatty, overly cheesy etc. but again, please understand that there are different types of Italian food and the three do not compare. I am very glad you hate Mart Anthony's so much and that I will never see your impoverished, ignorant ass there.",-0.1134,0.823,0.09,0.087,0.5815134099616858

First off Jeff, you're right about ONE thing. It's never crowded. Because if you have ""cred"" or common sense of whatever you call it, you would realize that they do a good amount of delivery.  It's not pricey for the atmosphere and amazing staff catering to you. If you honestly think its too much money. You should probably not be eating out if you can't afford it. EVERYTHING on the menu is awesome, I haven't tried anything I havent fallen in love with. Sometimes I will just go and eat outside and it's one of the most relaxing meals.

But, we were feeling wild and decided to try another spot (difficult for a Taurus). After searching on yelp, we decided to try our hand at the Italian corner over by Bari and traipse around the handful of Italian joints and see what looked good. It was close to 9:30 on a Sunday, but we wanted to Gnocchi bad. We looked at several of the restaurants on Grand, and they looked bland, and a bit touristy. We ended up at Mart Anthony's and they seated us outside. I liked the grimey-ness of the place. It seemed legit.  First up, warm yummy bread. Score. Next, a couple of glasses of house red...not bad. I ordered the tortellini, and my girl the gnocchi. Both of which get passing grades. The side of garlic/lemon broccoli was fantastic. For dessert lemon gelato...nice and refreshing. And a couple of espresso to finish the night.  The wait staff were very helpful and our waiter must have said 'thank you' a hundred times. Super nice guy. My only beef with this place was that espresso tasted like strong drip coffee, and they charged 4$ a pop. Minus 1 full star.

Also tried the stuffed artichoke.  It was okay, not great.  I'm quickly learning that I only really like the stuffed artichoke at one place.  This one was average, some bites were juicier (more butter) than others which were a bit dry.  I think it's just hard to find that balance in a stuffed artichoke. The spaghetti with meat sauce was delicious.  It looks like there is not only beef, but sausage and a roast pulled meat of some sort.  Really flavorful and delicious.  I used the bread to sop up the leftover sauce.   I'll be eating Mart Anthony's again, I want to try some of the other pasta dishes next!",0.9915,0.765,0.203,0.033,0.5968509984639015
2010-06-30,4.0,"Friday Night Fights?  That's so 50s, palooka.  Times have changed.  It's 2010.  Move over Monday Night Football.  It's Monday Night Fights!   So I ventured over to Mart Anthony over on West Hubbard on a Monday night.  The erstwhile Mart was located over on West Randolph in a rather tawdry white building with a bright red neon sign.  I don't know what happened, but at some point it relocated over to Hubbard into an inconspicuous corner building that looks more like an old bar than an Italian restaurant.  You couldn't get more deeply ensconced in a neighborhood than this place is.  It's really too tucked away off the beaten path, and the dearth of customers testified to this.   Mart is an old school Italian joint.  If you can't attach ""old school"" to an Italian joint it's not real Italian in my zero percent Italian eyes.  At Mart, you've got your wood, your bar, your tablecloths, your olive oil and your old school waiter.  The one problem with the layout is that the bar is the main focus and there are two televisions hovering overhead.  One of the televisions was showing the Giants-Reds game on satellite.  Curious.  The space just feels more like a bar than a restaurant, but that's forgivable because it's a rather casual establishment. As to the food, it's old school goodness.  On my ongoing quest to find the best vodka sauce in the city, I ordered the cavatelli with vodka sauce.  It's hard to determine where exactly Mart's vodka sauce ranks, but it's in the top 10 percent in the city so far in my opinion.   The meatballs here deserve their own paragraph.  They're like buttuh.  Really, they are.  Your fork or knife will go through them like they're hot buttuh.  They are so smooth and refined so well they will float down your gullet like feathers in the wind after gracing your palate with their melting deliciousness.  These are the best meatballs I've ever tasted.   The other side item here which deserves its own paragraph is the chicken tortellini soup.  This is the freshest soup I've ever tasted.  The poor little carrots, onions, potatoes and chicken in this soup must have just lost their lives and ended up in this bowl of tastiness.  This soup has inspired me to attempt to make my own at home.  I must say, mine is not quite the same.  Order this soup! As far as ambiance, Mart is much more of a neighborhood joint than a destination, but don't let that take it off of your radar.  And as to the Monday Night Fights I witnessed here, well that just added to the interesting experience of the place.  The locals apparently sometimes have a few too many and unload verbally on the help.  Honestly, it was probably an isolated one off deal that was handled graciously by the help.  Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown.

2010-06-15,4.0,"Wow, this place is truly a hidden gem!  Situated in a primarily residential area of River West, this is not a place you would just happen to drive by unless you knew about it. Such is the case with me - I've driven down Grand Avenue a million times and never realized that such a great place was lurking nearby.  A friend who lives in the area recently discovered it and has been wanting me to try it. Okay, twist my arm. She last went there on a Monday night and was raving about their soup of the day, so we specifically made plans to go on a Monday night to try the soup again.  Our plans to sit outside were quickly dashed by Mother Nature, that fickle bitch. It's a shame too, because this is exactly the kind of place you'd want to sit outside. It's on a relatively quiet street, with little traffic, other than people walking their dogs.  We arrived and other than a bunch of dudes sitting at the bar and one other table, it was virtually empty.  We were shown to a table and the waiter/bartender came by and he remembered my friend from her previous visit the prior week and greeted her like an old friend. I love places that remember and recognize their patrons. He gave us a wine list and menus and gave us a few minutes to settle in.  She ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio and I ordered a glass of Ménage à Trois Cabernet (which always makes me blush when I say ""I'll have a Ménage à Trois""). She talked me into getting the soup (chicken tortellini) that she raved about and we also shared a starter of sausage and peppers.  The sausage and peppers came in a white wine and garlic sauce and was really good. I liked it better than she did, as she remarked that it was better on her last visit. The soup was good too, but I thought the tortellini in it could have been cooked a little longer and the soup also needed a bit of salt as it was a touch under seasoned. Still very good though.  Since the appetizer and soup were rather filling, I decided to go with a small house salad and a stuffed artichoke appetizer for my main course and my dining companion ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce and a meatball on the side. I was feeling like I should have ordered a pasta but I knew my friend would share hers with me if I wanted. I wasn't about to go hungry.  Our food came out pretty fast. I was expecting an entire stuffed artichoke but instead it was just half. For $10 I would have expected to be served the whole thing. The salad was your basic house salad, but it was very fresh and the dressing was good too. The artichoke was really good. I usually prefer them grilled, but since I am a sucker for a good artichoke, I ate almost the whole thing. The breadcrumb stuffing had good flavor and it wasn't mushy at all, which can be the case sometimes with stuffed artichokes.  My friend's spaghetti looked really good, as did the meatball, and I was able to get a generous taste of both. The sauce on the spaghetti was rich and meaty but the meatball was the best part. It was fluffy and light and not dried out and overcooked, which is usually my hesitancy in ordering meatballs. It was a generous portion and she ended up taking some home, even after sharing with me.  Mart Anthony is a great neighborhood spot that clearly has a lot of regulars and with good reason. The food is well-prepared and delicious and the service was friendly and engaging. Love the atmosphere too - nothing fancy, but very cozy and inviting.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying some more.

2010-05-21,1.0,"To make sure I wasn't nuts, I decided to give this another shot after Vito trashed my review and impliedly called me out.  I must say, it's pretty funny when people talk about this being a ""neighborhood"" place.  Vito says neighborhood and he means he's within walking distance.  I say neighborhood because Mart Anthony's is less than half a block down the street.  Maybe my perspective is different, as my favorite authentic Italian food comes from La Scarola or Bella Notte, down the street (two great examples of the definition of 'neighborhood gem'), mixed with the fact that Mart Anthony's is, literally, in my neighborhood.  I could get to the restaurant without crossing a single street.  I should like it, the same way I love Salerno's pizza.   But I don't.  The food is so mediocre that it isn't funny.  Seriously, red sauce should be better.  Alfredo should be better.  Pasta should be fresher.  Prices should be lower.  It's a ghost town most nights.  I will commend the staff, at least the front of house folks, as being very friendly.  Had the veal marsala again.  It was tough and chewy and the sauce tasted like it came from a can and was watery.  A friend had a steak, and it was overcooked, dry, and leathery.  The veg was nice.  His pasta had a red sauce, and it was pretty average and watery. And the staff nonsense is still loud, making living in the neighborhood unpleasant (as in MY neighborhood, not your neighborhood that is blocks and blocks away). One cook has fit his Nissan Sentra with an illegal muffler system.  Two pipes push exhaust gas, one coming out of each side of the car behind the front wheels.  There are no mufflers on this car.  Ever heard a 4 cylinder with straight pipes start at 2 in the morning?  Ever heard that same loud car warm up for 10 minutes, a car door close, and the sound that car produces when the cook mashes the throttle?  I have.  Every.  Damn.  Day. Those patrons that smoke seem oblivious to the fact that from where they stand, and west on Hubbard to the next light, are residences.  I just heard a loud, drunken conversation about the hawks win, something about a guy being a douche, and the obligatory screech of the wasted drunk girl yelling ""wooooooooO!"" So, as someone who lives in the neighborhood, I have a unique perspective.  On the one hand, I should love this place:  it's so close that I could literally hop there in less than 20 hops.  With all the reviewers saying how awesome this place is, how authentic the food is, and how ""neighborhood-y"" this place is, it pains me to say that these people clearly have not eaten at a good, authentic restaurant, don't care about the definition of ""neighborhood"" and the relationship the establishment has with it, or - and this may be the case - everyone who has left positive reviews are the same people who drink too much, then go outside to smoke and talk as inappropriate loudly as possible.  Or maybe the fact that this place has turned my nice, clean, quiet neighborhood into a loud. lamer version of drunky town has made it difficult to have much nice to say about da Mart.  I can't tell.  Either way, it's all good.  Go ahead and try Mart Anthony's.  Just do yourself a favor and shortly after you do, go try La Scarola (or Bella Notte, or any number of better italian restaurants in the area) and tell me this place is even close to on the same level. Side note: My favorite restaurants are neighborhood restaurants.  I spend most of my dining dollars supporting the businesses in my area and have reviewed a good number of my faves.   And I just realized Vito B. has written one review.  About this restaurant.  Specifically contradicting me, establishing his cred as living in the neighborhood, and saying this mostly dead restaurant is the best thing since refrigeration.  So I'd love to know why this place is so empty most of the time if it is so darn amazing?  Any place can get a little busy on Friday and Saturday night.  Sunday through Thursday are usually so dead that less than 20 people eat there all day.",0.9941,0.77,0.145,0.085,0.5316832187420423

The server was prompt and friendly, he brought out warm crusty bread immediately and got our drinks.  Though they have a full bar, the wine list is a bit limited, but I guess I'm just used to the tomes now presented at newer Italian restaurants.  We ordered our food, which ranged from chicken vesuvius to cheese-stuffed ravioli to gnocchi and meatball.  My boyfriend had ordered the gnocchi and meatball and was so excited when it was presented as one giant ball, the true Italian way of serving meatballs.  Everyone was very happy with their meals and we split a tiramisu for desert.  The rest of the table ranted and raved how it was the best tiramisu ever but I couldn't get over the fact that I think they drizzled Hershey's syrup over it. We came here on a weeknight, so it wasn't very busy but I can see how this place would fill up with regulars on the weekend.  I will definitely be back, it's nice to be served great food in a unpretentious, throwback (but not retro) environment.  This is the sort of place your parents would have gone to for a ""fancy"" date back in the 70's or 80's.  The staff is friendly and welcoming and you feel like family by the time you leave.  But please, one request for next time: put some candles on the tables!",0.9952,0.837,0.152,0.011,0.4809387755102041

We sat in the back and I faced the ""restaurant"" end so I think I had a different experience than my boyfriend who was facing the bar and TVs.  We started with calamari, which I really liked. It was a little chewy for the BF but he still ate it. Please keep in mind that I practically hadn't eaten all day so anything was going to taste good.

The prosciutto was a little bit of a bystander, there wasn't much cheese, and the chicken was slightly overcooked, but the sauce was excellent!

My BF got the veal parmesan with a side of pasta with arrabiatta sauce. The sauces on the veal and the pasta were excellent but, again, the veal was overcooked. It was cut so thin that to overcook it made it a little unpleasant and almost sandy to eat. It was almost like just eating fried batter. We also had the tiramasu which was good.

The service was good.  Food was excellent.  My bf and I shared some pasta dishes and a salad.  We left very full with a bag full of leftovers.  We have been here several times so I have tried a handful of items. It's very dark and romantic in here so I think it's a good place for a date.  Seems like a place where the mob would hang out.  :)  It's also located near some great bars so it might be fun to check it out before hitting the west town bars on grand.  It can get a little pricey depending on what you order but most italian is that way.,0.9952,0.76,0.24,0.0,0.4736345598845598
2010-01-02,2.0,"Came in for lunch recently with a friend. I've been to some of the restaurants in this little pocket off of Grand Ave and always wanted to give this hidden little joint a try. We ordered the fried calamari as an appetizer. It was ok. The calamari was a bit chewy and thick but had a nice light batter. I was surprised that they did not serve it with fresh lemon though the waiter did bring some out when we made the request. I had the eggplant parmigiana sandwich which was one of the specials. It was not very crispy and was unfortunately both soggy and overly salty. My friend ordered the gnocchi with vodka sauce. The sauce was good but the gnocchi did not taste fresh. Seriously, if you come to a one of the restaurants in this area, you expect fresh pasta. Overall, I was disappointed with the food here. Too bad, as I had read some good reviews here.  I'll give this place another try for dinner but you may be better served heading to Bella Notte if you're in the area.",0.9727,0.761,0.182,0.057,0.5791666666666666

There were two equal size chicken breasts side-by-side, each with a spinach leaf (or two) and a small strip of prosciutto. The pasta and sauce on the side was college dorm quality. I only took a few bites of pasta but finished the entree. I agree that the food was surprisingly light.

2008-11-19,1.0,So upon reading all of the other reviews of this place I decided that I need to get the word out about how horrid Mart Anthony's really is. I like everyone else was excited to try this place... really has that old school little Italy vibe about it and I figured since it was packed that the food had to pretty good as well. My friends and I were seated and given menus.  First thing I noticed was how ridiculously over-priced everything was... so that hindered my menu options.  So I settled on a salad with grilled shrimp.  My roommate ordered an alfredo dish and my other friend ordered a salad as well.  They brought us a basket of bread that was mediocre at best while we waited for our main course. So the food arrives and the portions are ridiculously small.  Last time I checked if you are ordering a salad that is 15 bucks... it should be bigger than a side salad.  Well I decided to dig in... took a bite... dressing was horrible (house italian) and the shrimp were definitely over cooked and amateurishly seasoned.  My friend's chicken salad followed suit... disappointing like mine.  But I save the worst for last... my roommate's alfredo smelled of baby vomit.  She had me try a bite and it was literally noodles with some watered down milk excuse for alfredo sauce.  Absolutely no flavor whatsoever.   I come from an Italian family and this crap was as far from authentic as it gets... I've had better food from an Olive Garden (which is by no means authentic either).  The real kicker was when the bill came... it was over 50 dollars for this dinner of disappointment.   So in conclusion... save your money and skip this place...also I could have totally done with out the annoying White Sox fan that was seated near us... yelling at the tv like it was her bastard child.,0.8641,0.761,0.137,0.102,0.4997289972899728
