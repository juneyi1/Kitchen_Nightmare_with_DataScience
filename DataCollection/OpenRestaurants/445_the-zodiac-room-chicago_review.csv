2016-01-13,4.0,"Came in as a curious food taster. I have to say that chicken consomme starter broth was dynamite.  I could have just had that for lunch to be honest.  I ordered the beef wellington. While the flavors were all there, it wasn't really a wellington in the traditional sense. The beef was outside of the pastry rather that inside of it. In spite of this, the beef was high quality, the pastry was cooked well and the mushrooms and sauce were delicious. This was accompanied by a creamed spinach.  I would go back again, but I think I'll ask for extra chicken consomme.",0.5927,0.888,0.09,0.022,0.5854545454545454
2015-08-24,5.0,Fabulous lunch spot. Came her for a fast lunch - maybe better suited for a day off than a power lunch just because the pace of the service tho excellent is a little more suited for a long lunch.  Steak salad was literally a steak and a salad which I'm not used to (the steak is often sliced) but I thought that it tasted wonderful and was cooked perfectly.

It really motivates me to grind harder in life. That shimmery ocean blue $300 velvety soft silk shirt?? Do I need it? (no). Do I love it? (gorgeous).  *works harder in life* Can I justify spending $300 on some fabric with buttons?? sadly not today. good bye beautiful shirt! Pros: -Excellent service- everyone was so friendly, responsive, helpful and it definitely had an air of high quality service.  -Loved how fast items were removed or arranged onto our table and how fast the waters were filled.  -Our waiter even commented on the ""wait time"" of the salad which I definitely did not think was that long.  -Food was delicious- I had the orange mousse chicken salad which was amazing and the sister had crab salad which had avo- yummy!  -Dessert was great- sister had the pumpkin creme brulee and I had NM cookies that was presented in a NM box with recipe card (so cute!) -They have the most adorable after lunch mints that come tucked into NM envelopes post lunch with the bill.  Cons: -Pricey for lunch- our meal was $60 w/o drinks.  Everything else was decent- will likely return if I'm ever in the area or in the mood for that chicken salad.

I'll continue to visit this Zodiac Room mostly out of convenience because I hate to wait for lunch (especially now that I have a little one), but it won't be my first choice like it always is back in Boca.

2010-01-01,4.0,"I am not really a fan of Neiman Marcus in general, but I have mad love for the Zodiac Room. Since not much gets in the way of my love of food, I just avoid the store and head straight up the escalator to the Zodiac Room. I am a true creature of habit and always get the same thing when I come here, which isn't too often anymore since I no longer work in area. I don't think I've ever not ordered the mandarin orange soufflé with chicken salad. I'm not sure why they call it a soufflé, it's more like the most delicious jello you've ever tasted. Silky-smooth and fruity, with mandarin orange segments on the bottom. The chicken salad is perfect. It's all white meat, with very little mayo (which I loathe when it's overused), and just enough celery for texture and crunch. I never order chicken salad anywhere else as it usually grosses me out by either having dark meat in it, too much mayo, or worse, both.  The rest of the dish is accompanied by a fresh fruit salad. The fruit is so ripe and sweet and it amazes me they can get fruit like that in the dead of winter, and the best part is no ""filler fruit,"" aka melon. You're brought a complimentary cup of chicken consommé (my little niece calls it ""chicken finger tea""), and a warm, eggy popover served with strawberry butter when you sit down, which is the perfect prelude to this delicious meal. The server overheard me raving about the chicken salad and just about made my day when she informed me that they sell it by the pound for carry out. Whenever I get a craving for chicken salad, this is the only place I go. It's always consistently good and never disappoints.",0.9941,0.703,0.207,0.089,0.6188194444444444

When the consommé came out with the puffy bread, we thought it was the hot tea we ordered!  I honestly thought it was a stingy small serving of tea!  Then we sipped it and realized it was broth!  The puffy bread was called a popover and came with all the meals.  Those popovers were really good! It's served with strawberry butter, yum! We enjoyed our sandwiches (all we could afford, right!) Looking around, patrons are of the elite class and obviously taking a break from expensive shopping.

I've been there several times and while I was never really impressed with the service today it hit an all time low.  I went with a friend for my birthday and even though we had reservations we got an awful table and the service was horrible. They had two private parties going on and apparently not enough staff to cover the overflow of people. We had to flag a waiter or any staff member down several times to get any kind of service. We tried to complain  to the manager on staff but he was so busy he was nowhere to be found (actually, I saw him cutting cake for one of the parties before we left). We tried to complain at the customer service desk. However, we got a manager who kept apologizing but gave us no reasons to want to return or any reasonable explanation for their poor planning. It would have been nice if they had at least comped us for the expresso they gave me, which by the way sucked.

2008-08-19,4.0,"The Zodiac Room is more of a destination restaurant than it used to be. In the good ol' days mother and daughter [typically] would stop in for lunch after a morning of shopping at Neiman's and perhaps up and down Boul Mich. Popovers, strawberry butter and [true] chicken consommé started the meal usually followed by some form of mayonnaise salad in a croissant and a fresh fruit garnish all served in a white and pastel room with linens and silver. Throw in a fashion show with expensive dresses on leggy models tempting enough for any bank account and you have an experience that feels like it should be out of reach of the typical nine-to-fiver but where everyone is welcome ... if you can find. Tucked above Michigan Avenue through the marble halls of Neiman Marcus and up the back escalators, The Zodiac Rooms oddly comfortable fluorescent glow welcomes you and before you know it you're being served popovers with strawberry and chicken consommé. Things haven't really changed. The menu is a little less familiar, but the waitstaff is still just as uninterested in moving you through the meal as they ever were [they'll accommodate you, but you have to tell them you're on a schedule: something many of them are still trying to comprehend] and while the mother/daughter combo is less likely than a group on their lunch break, you'll still find the leggy models trying desperately to figure out which table might be most likely to feign interest in them. If you've never lunched at The Zodiac Room and it's in your bubble, I'm going to go ahead and recommend it.

Great salads here, first of all.  Very unique, filling, tasty, and seasonably appropriate.  I recently had an arugala salad with glazed pears and goat cheese - even better than it sounds.  They change their menu up here and there, so I used to also be a big fan of the cesar salad - the dressing was delicious.  Also, one can never beat the popovers with the strawberry butter.  Yum.  I'm getting hungry thinking about it.

2006-05-10,4.0,"Tucked away on the fourth floor of the Neiman Marcus building on Michigan Ave. is a huge, spacious, and airy restaurant that is surprisingly reasonably priced (for a ""fine dining"" place in Neiman Marcus) and also pretty good. Overall, this place gets 3.5 stars. I have a theory on restaurant and store fixture placement: the more spaced out things are, the more expensive the place will be. The Zodiac Room surprised me because, although there is TONS of room up there in their restaurant and tables are not cramped or crowded at all, the prices really did not match the sometimes outrageously exorbitant ones found in the store below. Upon being seated (there was quite a wait on Friday), miniature cups of chicken with a scone and gigantic, excitingly funny-looking popovers and strawberry butter arrived at our table. The wait staff was very friendly, and, even though they were busy, we never once felt rushed to order or finish our meals. The pan-seared yellowfin tuna with pasta that I had was pretty good. It was tasty, but a tiny bit dry (despite my asking for it medium rare). I would, however, recommend the tuna salad (tried someone else's and thought that was better). We ordered one of every dessert, and I must say that I liked the chocolate cake a LOT (very moist, delicious...and I'm not even a big chocolate fan!) and the creme brulee was also very good. As a side note, the bathrooms on the fourth floor were surprisingly run down. I was a little disappointed. I noticed the stalls had a little chipped paint and the soap was pretty standard fare. Not so ab fab in my books. So, in the end, 3.5 stars for good food, good dessert, spacious setting, pretty affordable prices, and below-expectations Badezimmer.",0.9921,0.817,0.166,0.017,0.5768128654970761
