I also want to point out some issues with the online presence in hopes it gets fixed. The phone number is incorrect on the website and with Google, I had to find it though the Yelp page. The PDF menu on the website is also something like 150MB. It's crazy to have a file size that large for a menu and it takes long to download (even with fast internet).  While Cozy Corner has the charm of a local diner, it could improve with better service and correcting the phone number online. I recommend: eggs benedict and corned beef hash.

As soon as my boyfriend and I walked in we were told we could sit anywhere we wanted around the corner. There were only 2 tables available by the trash, literally across from the trash with flies all over aaaaaand I wasn't having it. So we were sat in the other dining room. Our waitress was super sweet and was ON it with our drinks. I ordered the Spicy Malibu Chicken sandwich, which comes with jalapeno, swiss AND mayo. I ordered easy swiss and light mayo . Clearly, the kitchen & Expo waitress didn't give a *bleep*. When I got the sandwich, it had ONE single large jalapeno, was wrapped in Swiss and had NO mayo. So I sent it back and our lovely waitress Laura was sweet enough to put in a new order and take my plate. Unfortunately, the Expo waitress brought the plate back to me, RUDELY put it to my face and asked me, ""you don't want it?"". As a server myself, I'd NEVER bring a plate back to a customer. So I rudely explained why I didn't want it in response to her nasty attitude. After our nice waitress came back with my new order, Ms. Expo waitress walked over to check on us. Understanding it might have just been a slight on the kitchen and just a bad choice in sandwich and presentation, I APOLOGIZED for being not too nice about my response to her shoving my plate in my face. She responded with, ""mmm, Yea and well, that sandwich doesn't come with mayo"". I had to side check my neck. Lady I'm the customer and I just apologized to YOU. Unbelievable! So I responded with, ""...mmm, no your menu explicitly states 'swiss & mayo'""... I just ate my sandwich and left with a bad taste in my mouth. I would never drop that kind of attitude on a customer at my restaurants. Feeling sorry for our other waitress I still left %20 tip.

Always friendly, fast and she is usually 2 steps ahead of us. Knows our order and gets us the check quickly. This place is spacious, which most breakfast places in the city are usually pretty tiny.

Today was an exception I would have given them 5 stars but the service was to say the least horrible. We were seated fairly quickly didn't have to wait especially since it was lunch time.  My biggest complaint that stopped from giving a 5 star rating was our waitress. It took her a good 10 minutes to ask what we wanted to drink. Then another 10 minutes passed by when she came over to ask if we were ready to order. Which was unlikely since she never brought over menu's. Once we got our order taken she got it wrong. This has never happened to me here ever. I guess there is always that one time.  All in all its a wonderful place to dine and relax.

2016-05-30,3.0,"I have mixed feelings about this place.  On the plus side: 1) It's a comfortable place that's consistently busy. The counter seats were perfect for a quick meal alone, and the booths looked great for couples and families. Lots of people from the neighborhood seem to eat here. There aren't a lot of other places for breakfast or lunch close by; you have to go to the next Blue line stop (Logan Square) for more options. 2) The service was good when I was there, around lunch on a weekday. My food came quickly, and my waitress checked in on me. 3) The portion sizes are ample. On the minus side: 1) There was almost nothing under $11 on the menu, which seems high to me for eggs and bacon. That said, it's not completely out of line with the area. 2) I'm personally not a big fan of brunch food, which is what this place serves: pancakes, waffles, eggs, bacon/ham, skillets, and some sandwiches. I got the vegetarian skillet, which was a large cast iron pan of shoestring hash browns and veggies with 2 eggs on top; it needed hot sauce, which was readily available.  3) This is a small nitpick, but they don't do substitutions (e.g. tomatoes) for the toast/pancakes, which forced me to waste food, since I can't eat either.

I don't speak Spanish, but the girl I was with, does and she understood what the waitress said. The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because the hot chocolate was a large serving for a good price, but the service was terrible.

We went on a Saturday so of course it was insanely crowded. The Cozy Corner parking lot literally has 5 parking spots, but street parking was readily available so it's wasn't that much of a problem.  When we walked in it was pretty chaotic. People were just standing around everywhere waiting to be seated. We put our name down and were lucky enough to snag some seats on a bench to wait. We ended up waiting around 15 - 20 mins. Not bad for Saturday morning brunch.  When we got to our table we got our water and coffees pretty quickly. They were also on top of the refills which was really nice.  I ordered the Abuelita Skillet which came with a side of toast or pancakes, I chose the pancakes of course. The chorizo in the skillet wasn't the best I've ever had in my life, but definitely not the worst. It was cooked well for a diner style restaurant. The Jalapeño cheese, salsa, and pineapples were the best part of the dish for me. However, they only give you this little container of salsa, I wish they gave you more. The pineapple added a really unique flavor to the dish. Not something you typically taste in a Mexican style skillet. The pancakes were soft, fluffy, and delicious. No complaints here.  Overall, a good brunch spot. I'll definitely be back as it's so close to me. Looking forward to trying some of the other items on the menu.",0.9573,0.77,0.144,0.086,0.5749183006535948

Pros: We got seated right away, and service was fast, from taking our order to pouring the coffee to bringing out the food.  The restaurant was clean and the bathrooms were clean. The dining room was comfortable with plenty of space and natural light. The decor was cute.  We ordered the greek omelette with a hash brown and a pancake.  The omelette and hash brown were pretty good.  Our nephew liked his belgian waffle.  For diner coffee, it was decent tasting, although kind of weak.   Portions were huge.  Cons:  The bacon was inedible.  Our nephew like most teenage boys does not have the most discriminating tastes, but even he could not stomach it.  I tried a little bite and it tasted of grease. Our pancake was also pretty bad.  I had to cut it with a knife, because it was too rubbery to cut with a fork.  I ate it anyway because i was hungry - so it was edible, just not tasting very good.   The prices weren't terrible compared to other restaurants in the area, but all things considered I think we could cook something better-tasting on our own.  I usually give two-star ratings to restaurants in which I didn't care for the food, so here we are.  Ok in a pinch, as long as you don't care too much about how it tastes.",0.8658,0.82,0.114,0.066,0.6242985842985842

2015-07-31,4.0,My good friend (known her since freshman year of high school ) lives in this area and she invited me for brunch here. We came in and it was packed! Here is the list of pros and cons: PROS ------- 1. Parking lot 2. Large menu options from breakfast to lunch 3. Ticket system for seating. You go to the register and get a deli style ticket with a number and wait to hear your number in order to be seated.  4. Skillets that are delicious. They roast their jalapeños in the morning too! They also had corned beef hash (nothing like Teds bulletin in DC but still decent).  CONS ------ 1. Too many mistakes. We both asked that our skillets not have cheese or hash browns. They brought both of ours with hash browns. They went and took one back. We also asked no cheese but the second batch they tried to bring had cheese. The waitress Maria was very apologetic. She didn't charge for the coffee. She even went and brought proof that she had written it down correctly but that the chef was then culprit.  She was sincere and apologetic so I won't mention beyond that. It's a cute diner and the food was scrumptious. I would definitely be back.,0.9534,0.858,0.116,0.027,0.448009768009768

On the way back to the CTA I decided to stop for lunch. Ambience: it reminded me so much of the south. Where I am from. It felt like I was back home at a local diner where the usuals would go every morning for their cup o' coffee and gossip.  That's about all I enjoyed about the place. The food was way subpar for the price. What baffled me was that PANCAKE is in the name of the restaurant, yet I can't recall having a worse pancake in my life. Me and Aunt Jemima could have made a better pancake. Dense, flavorless, and completely artificial tasting.  The Mexican Omelet. Had so much potential. Except I couldn't really taste anything because it was so drenched in the oil of the griddle that a film of grease was covering my tongue and thus, I barely finished half.  The hash browns. Okay. Much better than the omelet and galaxies better than the pancakes. Service. It took my waitress 15 solid minutes just go take my order. I sat right at the bar; in front of her. The restaurant was busy, but they had plenty of wait staff to accommodate customers accordingly. She had a good attitude, which is why this review won't receive 2 stars. Price. As mentioned earlier, I don't think that I was served was a $11 plus tax meal. I could have received a better breakfast at McDonald's for a third of that honestly.  If you're not used to true diner style cooking, then one would probably love this place. However, I've been around diners all of my life and this just didn't fit within my expectations.

The waitresses have always been so nice and everything I've had has always been delicious. I don't recall our order ever being wrong. They are usually busy when we come here and have recently switched to a numbering system which is much better than taking people's names, especially because there is little standing room and people often go outside to wait. The wait is usually no longer than a half hour. Fast forward to today. My boyfriend and I went to our normal spot for brunch, and expecting a wait, we weren't surprised that people were outside. We've come here almost every week for the better part of a year. Today they were busy and doing the number system. We got the number 1 and someone had just turned in the number 99, which technically would get called before 1 because they were about to hand it to the next person who came in after us. My boyfriend politely asked to have 99 instead and the manager very rudely says ""We have a system"". This would have been fine, except he REPEATED it 6 times and talked over my boyfriend who kept trying to say he understood along with acting like we were causing a big scene. He just happened to be walking by as the woman at the register was about to ask how many we were and if we minded eating at the counter. They always ask this when they've been busy. We've both worked in restaurants so I understand it's incredibly stressful when it's busy, but that's no excuse to treat regular (or any) customers like that. So we walked out and are currently looking for somewhere to eat. Still deciding if we're angry enough to never come back again. **Update**  We almost decided to just go back home until we remembered that there was another location near Pulaski and Diversey. We really wanted Cozy Corner food so we trekked over there to see if we'd have a better experience. They listened to our story about the Logan Square location along with seating us immediately and providing amazing customer service.

Exactly what you yearn for when hung over and sleep deprived. The biscuits and gravy looked sexy too for this corporate zombie going on 4 hours of sleep and too much wine. Again though, I gotta stay strong and not even think about such delicious fluffy things. Unless it's below -7 then I'll let myself have a heart attack induced warm loving hug through thick sugary fried French toast... Mmmmmmmmmmm. But I have three family weddings to go to soon people and that means my grandma will be there at all three and I don't want to hear that I've really let myself go living in the Midwest. The shame. She's as blunt as they come as are my parents. This is operation stay looking not chunky.  I had the vegetable skillet with sunny side up eggs, no cheese cuz I kinda hate cheese except for the bad shit = oozy nacho fake cheese. Or velveeta. Yeah baby, yeah. This skillet though. It hit the spot with lots of veggies mixed in with hashbrowns. Douse it with habanero sauce and ketchup I had at the desk and it was so good! It's definitely large enough to serve two people. It comes with toast or pancakes and I gave that to my coworker. I didn't get any coffee here for obvious reasons.. when I can barely stand shitty burnt Starbucks as it is but I'd eat that veggie skillet again for sure. Delicious.

2013-12-14,1.0,"My girlfriend and I were excited to find a cool looking breakfast spot near our apartment to call our neighborhood breakfast place. Turns out this isn't going to be the one. Instead of a locally owned, mom and pop shop kind of feel, this place is just a fancy Denny's with Mexican burritos.The burritos were fine, but I don't avoid Denny's because the food is bad, I avoid it because there's nothing but a bunch of miserable, unfriendly servers just looking to turn a table. I think that's the best way to describe ""Cozy"" corner.  The moment we walked in the door we were greeted with disdain of our patronage and a very unwelcoming gesture pointing us toward the general area of our table. This table apparently had a time limit because not only were we rushed while looking at the menu (the moment we sat down after taking our layers of jackets off once coming in from the snow we were asked if we were ready to order, then another three minutes after that, which is fine if they didn't give us the impatient vibe of trying to get us in and out as quickly as possible) we were also asked to leave the moment we signed our check. Sorry, just got a refill of this swill you call coffee, and I just tipped 35%, give me a minute. But they didn't, and we left, and we didn't even get as much of a nod from the manager or hostess or anyone at front of the house, all who were present, while exiting. No ""thanks for coming in,"" ""come again,"" or ""have a good one."" All of this I expect from Denny's, and I understand you're busy, and I'd even accept one or two of the issues we had with our dining experience, but from the moment we walked in to the moment we left, there's only one nice thing I can say about the experience: the burritos were fine.",0.9262,0.817,0.114,0.07,0.507986111111111

The proportions of everything crispy/greasy/fresh/salty/hot were spot on, and the accompanying pancakes were just small enough to keep me wanting more but big enough to remind me that a larger portion would probably be more exciting in theory than practice.  $11.39+tip equaled a $14 meal, which was more than the $10 mark I was shooting for, but the quality was better than the Golden Nugget or any other cheapster pancake house.

We have been regulars at the Cozy since moving to the neighborhood - both on the busy weekends and during the week for before-work early bird specials. Nery and several of the servers know us by name and always chat with us and tell us to have a nice day and to come back soon. Regrettably, we have made the difficult decision to no longer give this establishment our business. The new owner who came in a few months ago has ruined the Cozy for us, and we cannot in good consciousness give that man another dime. He fired some of our favorite servers and replaced them with much younger (and very physically attractive) waitresses. Last time we were there, our favorite waitress left in tears. He condescendingly speaks to the cooks using bad Spanish with an awful accent, which is rude and patronizing. He also gives preferential seating to certain customers, when it has always been first-come, first served in the past. Our Nery had lost the spring in her step, too, and that made us very sad. We decided we might give them one more try last Sunday, but when we went in, we noticed several people crowded in the foyer waiting to be sat, while there were a few empty tables and some seats at the coutner.

And once you do get seated, you're treated to high quality breakfast.  Their chicken fried-steak & eggs always hits the spot, but the real highlight for me is their sausage, and that's coming from a loyal bacon & eggs guy.  I hardly ever order sausage instead of bacon, but at Cozy Corner, I order sausage everytime because it is that good.  It's like that high-end turkey sausage.  It's the bomb.  Quite tastey.   Makes me happy, just like Cozy Corner in general.

2012-10-19,3.0,"Well I was looking for a new breakfast place and found this one on Yelp and decided to give it a try. I really kind of hate to give it a 3 star rating considering so many others rate it higher, but to me it really was an A--OK kind of experience for me so that's what I'm having to go with. My server was attentive to my needs and made sure I was not left needing anything so that is one of the reasons I will probably be coming back here from time to time.  Another positive point in my visit was the food arrived very quickly.  I was seated at the counter and had a ringside seat to watch the cooks.  When I saw 4 cooks in such a small cooking area I thought it would be a comedy show to sit and watch them getting in each others way.  I was wrong!  Even though the space they work in is small they worked together like a well oiled machine and pushed out a LOT of food very quickly. The reason I've gone with a 3 star rating instead of a 4 or 5 star rating is the flavors.  Now I did order what I would consider a risky new type of omelette that I would never have thought to make myself just so I could experience something new that I wouldn't eat at home.  It turned out the omelette was ok, but considering I knew when I ordered it that I very well might even dislike the flavors I'm not taking that taste into account for this review since it was just a combination of tastes that didn't thrill me and certainly was not the fault of the cooks. What convinced me to go with only a 3 star rating was the fact that the hash browns were cooked, but not hardly browned except for about 4 bites which were browned nicely.  Maybe it's just me (always a real possibility), but if hash browns are not browned and made to have a light crunchy texture to them they are just boring soft potatoes cut in strips.  I have to agree with another reviewer who stated the hash browns need some sort of spices added to them.  Just a little salt and pepper would have taken them from being very bland to good.  I know restaurants are hesitant to add salt sometimes because so many people are on low or no sodium diets, but there are several good salt free spice blends that could perk up their hash browns and take them to the next level. Overall it was a good experience and I'm sure I'll be back many more times.  Who knows maybe after trying some other items on the menu I'll be able to raise my rating up to be more in line with what so many other reviewers feel.  I'd feel comfortable recommending this place to others as a good diner, I just couldn't honestly say it was great.",0.9934,0.8,0.141,0.059,0.5476845171289617

Although CC is pretty packed, they move people along really fast. Service isn't necessarily friendly, but its efficient. I ordered the chocolate chip banana pancakes with a side of sausage to split with the bf. The pancake portion was great for $6.99 and they were pretty good. I liked the crispy outside with the soft inside. The bf also really enjoyed his Denver Omelet. We scarfed all our food and got out of there for under $25.

If you want a one-of-a-kind brunch that takes two hours out of your morning, this isn't your place. It's a no-frills diner that has its operation down to a science: and gets you in, out, fed, and cured of your hangover in less than a half hour. In my book, that's a winner.  PS: I suppose I should mention: The food was good!",0.8661,0.899,0.075,0.026,0.3652777777777778
2011-05-18,1.0,"All of the reviews about this place crack me up so much. First of all there is literally NOTHING special about this place at all. It is an average diner with average prices, and average service. To make matters even worse, they rush you out the door as soon as soon as you are done eating your average meal, which is just insulting. At a REAL diner patrons are encouraged to linger after their meal, finish their coffee, and chat with friends. Not here though. As soon as you walk in there is a sign reminding you to leave after you finish your meal (are you f-ing serious?!). In addition, there are employees that come up to your table as soon as you take your last bite (not exaggerating) and literally tell you to leave. Is this the type of ""family atmosphere"" that the reviews of this place speak of? I think not.  After meeting a co-worker at this place and experiencing all of its ridiculousness, I stopped to wonder why it was so crowded. I mean our coffee was burnt, our waitress was border-line retarded, our ommelettes were over-cooked, and our hash browns were burnt. Why would so many people frequent such an average establishment that is blatantly disrespectful to its customers? Well the answer is simple: People just go to places because they think it's cool to do so. In this case people think cozy corner is cool because  it's ""divey"" or ""local"" or ""family-runned"" or whatever you want to call it. Bottom line is that if this restaurant wasn't located on one of the trendiest corners on the north side, it would have failed years ago. However they are kept in business because all of the single-gear hipster trend-bots that buy into its schtick. Meanwhile they thank their loyal customer base how? By throwing them out on the street as soon humanly possible. What a great place! Average food, and rude service: Lets go here for breakfast! blech.  With a plethora of great diners in this city, there is absolutely no reason to frequent this place. If you want the same food for a cheaper price with better service and a staff that will respect you go to the golden nugget for god's sake. So if you are a regular person that enjoys good food, good service, and a friendly atmosphere DO NOT go here. But if you are a trendy hipster douche who could care less about quality and would rather eat at a place just to feel kitchy and sweet than by all means head over to the cozy corner for some mediocre food, a horrendously obnoxious staff, and a general lack of decency.",0.9717,0.808,0.119,0.073,0.549673641960876

There is always a wait, because the food is so good, and cheap!  We usually pay around $20 for two, which includes yummy breakfasts with add ons and coffees.  The food is delicious, I recommend the steak skillet, any of the egg specials, the pancakes with fruit or chocolate chips, and the french toast.  Their breakfast sandwiches are good too, and one of my favorite salads in all the world is their mixed green salad with chicken, dried cherries, and balsamic vinaigrette.  My only complaint regarding their food is they use nasty ranch.  That is their only downfall.  Otherwise, for what it is, the food is excellent.  We usually fall into a deep hibernation of pure laziness after eating here, even if we have just woken up! The food always comes out super fast, the busboys are always on top of refills and serve us coffee within seconds of sitting down.  The booths are very comfortable.  I always want to lounge around for a minute and drink coffee after my breakfast here, because for some reason I am filled with motivation and I can see clearly after eating, as I sip on some delicious coffee, and their coffee is GOOD.  I literally become full of ideas on how to make life better and take over the world after eating my breakfast here.  My boyfriends says it is the caffeine, but I don't know... it's not like that anywhere else, I tell you~!

The hairnet wearing waitresses who I can pretty much guarantee have been working at Cozy Corner Diner since Christ was a child are essentially wordless and efficient meaning they take your order, bring you mass quantities of coffee and diet Coke, drop off your food and put a check on your table.  Truly a no-frills diner experience. The menu includes pretty much anything you can think of that would be served at a diner.  I was debating on a skillet vs. an omelet, but made a game time decision and asked for the Cozy Corner version of a Grand Slam breakfast: 2 eggs (scrambled for me, thanks), bacon, French toast and a side order of hash browns.  Um... I ate almost everything on my plate.  It was just what the doctor ordered to combat my lurking hangover.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled.  The bacon was super salty and crispy.  The French toast was on the boring side, but really... it's a diner, not a 5-star restaurant.  It was still tasty and I still devoured it. While I've certainly had fancier fare, I appreciated my breakfast for what it was: Straightforward, honest diner food.  Sometimes it's challenging to find a non-fussy breakfast in Chicago, but by gosh, I've found it at Cozy Corner.  Sure, I've had better breakfasts, but if you're in the mood for, you know, regular stuff, you may want to check out Cozy Corner.  It's a win for sure!",0.9962,0.766,0.197,0.036,0.5363419101223978

It was a random afternoon. On a whim I decided to get my hair done in Logan Square, travel over to a mish mash Thrift store, and then...hunger struck me. And a caffeine headache. So I grabbed a RedEye (last resort) and hit Cozy Corner for enough food and liquid alertness to power me through the rest of the day... Wow, 3pm on a Friday and the place is nearly full! Crazy. My dreams of a ""cozy"" booth were shot, and I took a seat at the counter, to leave room for other parties wishing to conversate and not just stare idly into the distance or at the Redeye, both of which require the same amount of stimulation. I digress, I sat at the counter solo...and I liked it.  Counter guy:  ""Hiya Larry, Hiya Gerry!"" ::::looks at me::::: ""Hiya...lady."" Well, ""hiya"" back atcha sir, I'm here for some eggs.

It arrive approximately 4 minutes later, piping hot, fresh (the avocados were a brilliant shade of green, I almost thought they whisked this off a foodie photo shoot or something).  Bill comes: $17.85.  huh? I figured it quickly in my head, and for that to be the total my utterly fabulous omelette would've cost approx $15. Huh? Right.  So I give it to the lady at the register and she laughs and makes the correction and we joke that that would've been the bill when they enact the new ""egg"" or ""diner meal"" tax in the City of Chicago. She was so damn pleasant and fun, I nearly just dropped her a 100 percent tip, just because she didn't snarl at me, and did apologize profusely for the mix-up.

Also, I've been noticing the gradual aesthetic transformation of the previously kitschy/worn 80s look with a newer, more understated styling, and I think this weekend we may have seen the finished product, unless they're also planning to remodel the kitchen, which still looks the same as always, tin-foil and all. It really looks great, and I like the improved seating and the design. The food and service are as good as ever, and they have not (as of yet, anyway) jacked up any prices to compensate for the improvements to the design. So woo-hoo!

The guy behind the counter really did an amazing job directing traffick and addressing incoming patrons. Coffee is unlimited refills as all great diners are. I went with 2 other people and we were seated at the 3-person counter. I ordered the Fiesta skillet with chorizo, jalapeno, salsa, and 2 sunny-side-up eggs. It came with potatoe hash inside the skillet. It was the perfect size and flavor for a hearty breakfast meal. Each meal came with two slices of toast of your choice. My husband got the meat-lover's skillet and he looooved it. It had three kinds of meat (hearty portions of meat might I add), cheese, and sunny side up eggs as well. My friend ordered a Hungry Man's Special that came with 2 eggs (she had it scrambled...it was scrambled perfectly, not burnt, not soggy, just right), 2 pancakes (they smelled soo delicious, like a perfectly mixed batter), and a side of hash and sausage. Food was just the right amount for a hungry sunday morning, service was fast, no frills, and if you sit at the counter you can watch the fast grill cooks work their magic.  I think I even saw Mickey Mouse pancakes for the kids, but thats my own speculation.  Overall for the 3 of us with lots of food and coffee, it came out around $12 each including tax, which got NO complaints from anyone!

We found parking right in front, there were three of us and we were hungry. All good until it took us 35 minutes for a table. You place your name on this list and they simply call you. Well after 20minutes I checked and there were 5 other guests that had been called after me. I was a bit upset, explained it to the ""lovely"" lady and she said that we would be next. 10 minutes later we were seated. The waitress took 15 minutes to take our order. The prices were way too high for a simple egg, toast and sausage plate. ( I highly recommend HOLLYWOOD Grill on North and Ashland for both price, quality and service.) So as I am waiting for our food. I call my cousin to simply chat about this place and she is in shock when I tell her where I am at. She beings to tell me that when she ate at the Cozy Diner for breakfast she was disgusted to find a cockroach in her meal. All the management did was say I am sorry. She had to pay for her meal and that was that. Well after hearing that we all checked our meals...no little guests were found. The waitress came back within a minute after giving us our food with he check...ummmm you might want to wait a bit. What if we wanted an extra refill or a dessert or a to go meal. The waitress never came back to our table to check on us..The ONLY person who constantly did was the busboy and so we decided that the tip should go to him and not the waitress.

2006-11-16,5.0,"One of my favorite restaurants in the entire City of Chicago.  This place is a monument to greasy spoons and Americana!  Simply the best. The Mexican breakfast options (skillet, omlette, etc.) are simply incredible.  Even the basic eggs, bacon/ham/sausage, hashbrowns, and toast tastes delicious.  Everything is hot off the grill, all served from Mama's loving hands. If you're like most people and you work during normal hours and days, you'll have to make it a point to get up early on Saturday or Sunday to beat the crowds this place attracts.  It's well worth it, trust me.",0.979,0.757,0.243,0.0,0.546938775510204

2006-10-26,4.0,"i can't believe i hadn't gone here sooner. this place gets crazy busy on weekends, and it's easy to see why. i was solo, so i sat at the counter and marvelled at the speed & efficiency of the line cooks. everybody was really friendly, at least three different people came by with refills for my coffee. and the food was quite good, not the usual ball of grease i was expecting...not that that's necessarily a bad thing, but it's nice to feel like you're moving up in the world.",0.8763,0.798,0.16,0.042,0.605

2006-10-12,4.0,"Good, cheap and fast and a very lively croud. I noticed that everyone was friendly and the hostess made special effort to bring me a paper even though i did not ask for one. This appears to be a place where people from all walks of life eat. Looking around i saw tables full of screaming kids, to 3 cops (eating as usual ).  Spanish is the official language of this joint, however english is understood.",0.8553,0.814,0.153,0.033,0.44214285714285706
2006-09-08,4.0,"I wish this place were open 24 hours, but as they open at 5am (except sunday) you can have a cup of coffee in the dark and leave as the sun is coming up and still feel appropriately deviant. The soup and sandwiches are always reliably tasty, and the pancakes are the best you can get for under five bucks. The restaurant has a vague high-turnover, carry-out feel if you sit too close to the door, so try to secure a booth in the corner if you can. The walls are decorated with old advertisements and pictures of classic celebrities which adds a nice kitschy aura. I stopped in today to try out the praised omelets, and true to form the food arrived in just a couple of minutes. The waitress was somewhat neglectful (the place was packed, so it probably wasn't her fault) so in desperation I had to make eyes at the bus boy to get my coffee refilled. Actually, this worked out extremely well - my coffee was kept filled to the brim for the rest of the morning! ;) All in all, it's not my favorite diner, but the staff are super friendly (and will always gently steer you away from anything on the menu that's not especially impressive) and the man at the counter still remembers my name. It's a fun place to sit and people watch, but as far as diners go it's a little noisy for my taste.",0.9868,0.769,0.167,0.065,0.586231884057971

2006-08-13,4.0,"Went in for breakfast after our first night in Logan Square.  I don't think I've been to a diner with a warmer or more friendly staff.  I was introduced to the owner and formally welcomed to the neighborhood.  The service was great.  My coffee always filled and hot.  The hobo skillet was well-prepared and ready very quickly.  The hostess sat down and went over the menu and specials with me and even gave me free soup to take back home to my wife.  The soup is the pride of the house, apparently.  They offer several specials daily.  I'll definitely be back.  EDIT:  Also, I was greeted as ""Papi"" upon entering.  Way to make me feel like Tony Montoya.",0.9769,0.788,0.212,0.0,0.4281481481481481
2006-08-09,4.0,"I could literally see cozy corner from my old living room.  I would go here a lot with my companion before work ( I have to work on weekends, booo) for a nice skillet.  Super crowded on the weekend mornings but they try to get you in and out quickly.  I've also been for lunch and enjoy the turkey sandwich and cream of chicken rice soup.  Of course breakfast at Cozy Corner for me is not complete without a giant glass of tomato juice.  Good, friendly service and they have an ATM which saved my ass before I had the Chicago Plus Card for the EL.",0.9408,0.783,0.176,0.041,0.6513888888888889
2006-07-06,4.0,"WHY IS THIS PLACE NOT OPEN 24 HOURS??? Honestly, they could make a killing. But, I'll settle for the 13 hours it is open (5am-6pm Mon-Sat, 6am-4pm Sun).  I usually roll in Saturday or Sunday mornings anywhere from 11am-1pm for some brunch.  Just this past weekend I got the banana and pecan pancakes, and they were fabulous.  I have another friend that regularly enjoys the egg white delight, and another who prefers the mexican skillet.  Breakfast sandwiches are good, too.  I guess they have breakfast specials before 9am, but I'm NEVER there that early. When I'm not feeling like breakfast, I'll get the soup and salad a lot - chicken noodle soup is always good and get the garlic dressing for your salad, yum! The one matronly older woman who works there is always very pleasant, and when the guy's manning the counter he's very efficient as well.  It always looks pretty crowded when I go for brunch, but I've never waited more than about 20 minutes for a party of 4.  You can always eat at the counter, too.

2006-03-22,4.0,"The best greasy-spoon in the city! Yummmm! Try the veggie skillet. Or my favorite, just plain old eggs, toast, hashbrowns, and bacon. Very reasonably priced and not nasty like Golden Nugget. However, the atmosphere isn't the best. I live near it so I usually get the food to go.
