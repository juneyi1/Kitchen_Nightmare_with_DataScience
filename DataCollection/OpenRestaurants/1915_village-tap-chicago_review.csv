We had the Kafta kababs with side salad and an asparagus/mushroom salad--both were delicious and far more than we were hoping to discover at a pub. The bartender (Meghan) was incredibly accommodating and the chef (Monica) popped by and shared some of her recipe secrets (locally sourced produce and extra attention to the seasonings).

We went yesterday Friday 4/14 around 5pm and we're literally standing in the entrance for 5 minutes.

There were about 3 waiters/waitress that kept looking at us as well as the bartender like what we're we doing there. Absolutely not busy at all. They kept glancing at us from the bar and the woman gave a very odd stare. Made us uncomfortable so we just went ahead and left. Really disappointed in the service here. Won't be back.

2016-08-17,2.0,"This was during the Roscoe Village Fest so that might have been a factor. I did feel that the wait staff was overwhelmed since service was on the slow side, and sometimes we had to flag down our waiter. Overall I did not have a good experience there. My $6 draft beer was served in a PLASTIC cup. For dinner I ordered wings. I read the description which said that it had their signature sauce. I got it, and it was spicy. I am kinda a wimp when it comes to spicy, but I can handle a bit. I tried it by sampling a bit with my finger first, and it was too spicy for me. They did offer to re-make it BBQ style. BBQ sauce was fine, but the skin was rough to work though at times. I believe they might have been a bit overwhelmed from the fest crowd, and also rushed re-make, and get it to me. Still I only at about half before I got tired of trying to eat it which is rare since I'm usually a human disposal when it comes to food. My boyfriend ordered the Fish and Chips dish. The tartar sauce was spicy as well. Nothing on the menu said anything about those things being spicy. The menu did say the coleslaw was made with jalapenos, but nothing about the tarter sauce. I was just disappointed that this was not explained to us in the menu or by our server. I really wish I could post the menu to this review since I took a picture to prove there was no spicy warning. Because I wanted to be sure I had someone in our group who likes spicy food try the dishes. She said that she could handle them with no problem, but that they were a bit spicy. For me I'd put the wing sauce at a 6 out of 10 with a zero being mild (not spicy), and 10 being a Jalapeno. The tarter sauce I would but at a 4.5 out of 10, but it was also creamy which helped with the spiciness. -Sorry I feel I have to prove my experience with spicy food- Despite my low threshold for spiciness I do have some experience with it, or more a fear with great respect for it's power. I've had jalapenos before, and accidentally had an encounter with a Serrano pepper that still had seeds. That was not fun, but definitely a learning experience. Also, I do not trust anyone who is into spicy stuff when they say something ""isn't that spicy"". I remember you ghost chill pepper wing sauce *shakes fist*",-0.9601,0.832,0.062,0.106,0.498989898989899

Also, there was only 1 server working the entire patio and she was sooooooo slow. For our first round we all ordered ciders, and were brought beers about 15 minutes later. She apologized and said she'd come right back with our correct order, but never came! Throughout our entire experience, she was very unfriendly and seemed annoyed at us anytime we flagged her down(yes literally....) to try to order something  We also ordered a couple of different menu items to share and all were blah.

2016-03-04,5.0,"What a win! I recently moved to Roscoe Village and I was desperate to experience the restaurants and nightlife. We weren't particularly set on any place, but wanted to grab a beer before dinner. Passing the neighborhood bars, Village Tap looked welcoming and lively. It took a few minutes to find seats at the bar for two, but an off duty employee gave up her's for me. Who does that as a paying customer? That's just awesome customer service that's cultural.  Speaking of customer service, our bartender Mike wrote the book. He has impeccable timing - a hello and enough time to actually review a drink list before asking. It was their ""Stout Spectacular"" so I needed a lot of time to examine the listing. The Stone chai stood out and I loved it. Picking another to follow the strong flavors though was tough for me. Luckily mike was there to decode my preferences - what do I like, did you like the chai, why don't you try this first... I took his recommendation and ordered the Pollyanna Nitro vanilla bean... So good, I ordered it twice. Good thing we had crispy, creamy Wisconsin cheese curds to shove down our gullets. They stood up to the stout and were amazing. I only recently became a fan of deviled eggs, and I couldn't say no to Village Tap's version with feta and kalamata olives. Holy hell, they came out looking like brains in cut open scalps, but they were good. Like tiny,creamy Mediterranean salads.  My boyfriend and I were supposed to go to dinner later that night (9pm reservations elsewhere) but after hanging out with Mike and enjoying the apps, it was an easy decision to stay. We split the bacon and egg burger - so glad they have a potato bun instead of the tired pretzel. Yes, pretzel buns are delicious, but they're so ubiquitous I'm not impressed anymore. I had a great time at Village Tap and I'm looking forward to many more here in my new neighborhood!",0.9977,0.699,0.244,0.057,0.5984287317620651

While this is an OK spot I recommend skipping the food and sticking to the beer at Village Tap. I'm not quite sure what they're trying to do with their menu but the upscale options do not quite fit the divey atmosphere at Village Tap. On my most recent visit my boyfriend and I opted to share the Fish + Chips from the ""large"" section of their menu. The portion size was definitely not what I would deem ""large"" as we were only given two pieces of fish. The meal was fine but not enough for us to share and I would've appreciated a regular tartar sauce instead of the bland tarragon remoulade that comes with this dish.  Where Village Tap does shine is their carefully selected tap list which has a ton of different options and is well organized for those who are not beer experts. Every time we come in here I end up trying a new beer that I really enjoy. My boyfriend also loves that they typically carry Aquanaut beers, brewed by a small local brewery owned by a friend of his.

While the village tap does accommodate the space for large groups, the restaurant does lack a bit in the finer points of a community watering hole.  First, their beer menu is diverse, but over sells what is on it. I don't know of many places that charge 8 50 for a glass of ipa, but if you spend 4 sentences of your menu describing it, it must be worth it.  Second, the wait staff was not as inviting as you would like. I came in and started a conversation with the bar tender. They were clearly there just to take my order.   Third, it seems as though the management double booked the back room as there was a birthday party occupying the same space as our event. Things got out of hand when an organizer asked the table to be quiet while announcements were taking place, and then the environment got a little hostile. Certainly it was a miss understanding, but as a public service announcement, make sure you are firm with management if you need to reserve space.

A pretty good suggestion it was.  We started off with the cheese curds, and it was a promising start. Definitely the softest and flakiness I've ever had. It doesn't hurt they give you a hefty portion. Well it may hurt your arteries, but whatever. We decided to share the burger and an order of fish & chips. The burger was on point. Thick, juicy and well flavored, and the bacon and egg complimented it well. The fish and chips had potential to be some of the best I've ever had, except it was way under salted. It's a shame because everything else about it was fantastic.  Another point is deducted for the funky beer. We noticed some of the beers we ordered tasted off.

After I moved into the neighborhood and came back, I saw they changed their menu. At first I was dubious, but this has become a standard that I go to at least once a week.  Their menu changes with the availability of their ingredients, and while they've ditched the cornucopia of burgers, they have amazing other choices like hong kong brisket, or thuringer with sauerkraut and stone ground mustard.

That sounds like standard pub fare to me!"" BUT IT'S NOT. It's so much more. These nachos descended from heaven on the 7th day of Genesis when God proclaimed a day of rest, but quickly realized one can't properly rest with out Nachos. And all was good, Amen.

I have gone there twice in the past 3 months-both times were disasters. The kitchen, which is partly opened, was disgusting. Food spilled all over the floor, the counters--terribly unappetizing. The food, several years ago, used to be fantastic-particularly the burrito and burgers. They have now gone, I guess, more upscale. It is not working. I had fish and chips-some of the worst I have ever had. A fried chickpeas app was appalling salty-it was inedible and I told the waitress. On both of my visits, they were out of several beers on the menu and some of the beer did not taste fresh. What has happened to this place? I am shocked at the decline. Roscoe Village is lacking in bars and restaurants that are not complete dumps so I guess that is how they stay open.

However, after three attempts to give this place a shot, The Village Tap's chances have run out. The service is absolutely atrocious. Not only did we sit at our table for close to 15 minutes without so much as a greeting from any staff person, they actually glared at us as though we were imposing on them as they stood around chatting. While there were a handful other customers in the bar,  there was no readily apparent reason we were being shunned. Even a quick ""Hey, I'll be right with you"" was apparently too much to offer.  To make matters worse, all three times that I've been to the joint, the servers were rude (3 different servers!), and I felt very judged when I didn't order an exotic beer. Apparently drinking an Amstel Light makes me an offensive person. And the condescending chuckle my mother received when she ordered a Corona Light was the last straw.  As a person who has been in the service/hospitality  industry for nearly 15 years, I was appalled. Rude, slow, judgmental service and sub-par food. Sorry Village Tap- as a neighborhood resident who loves the pub scene, you've lost my business and the business of my friends and family. Step it up.",-0.8789,0.799,0.08,0.121,0.5462159863945578

The space was great and allowed us to move around and talk to everyone without disturbing other patrons.  The service was excellent all around from our server to the bus boy.  Our server even recommended that we spread out the pace of the appetizer tray, so the food was always fresh and everybody could enjoy.  We loved the variety of beers offered and had a great time trying lots of different options.  This was our first time here, but we'll definitely be back!",0.979,0.791,0.209,0.0,0.5435185185185185
2013-07-06,4.0,"Nice neighborhood spot in a slightly off-the-beaten-track location.  A long, narrow room with some art deco tendencies in the décor, with one of Chicago's few year-round beer gardens at the rear.  Their strong point is an excellent craft beer selection, 25 or so quality drafts, all available in pint or 12-oz. pours and 8-oz. pours, the latter a boon to us ""tickers.""  Some items also available by the pitcher.  Just a few bottles, of which the only one of much interest is Duvel.  The food menu (which I didn't try) is fairly limited--salads, sandwiches, charbroiled items, three Mexican items; dessert is limited to a chocolate brownie a la mode.   I tried four brews, all new to me:  -Great Lakes Rye of the Tiger, 7.5% ABV.   Nice bronze color, rich and intensely hoppy. -Great Lakes Silver and Gold India Pale Lager, GL's 25th anniversary special.  I may question their made-up style category, but the product is excellent.  Malt and ethanol nose, initial taste dominated by sweet malt, with hops coming in at the middle.  Slight medicinal note in the fade. (By the way, a shout-out to Great Lakes Brewing:  I don't think I've ever had a beer from them that I didn't like.  If I ever find myself in Cleveland, which God forbid, I'll definitely have to drop in on them.) -Green Flash Palate Wrecker.  Heavy head, red-bronze color.  Aromatic hops dominate the nose.  Intense hop front well balanced against a sweet malt base.  Hint of coconut.  Something ""chewy"" in the mouth feel.  A superior IPA. -Southern Tier Crème Brulee Imperial Milk Stout.  9.5% ABV.  Opaque very dark brown, with only a slight head.  Nose primarily chocolate, almost reminiscent of Bosco (remember that?)  Taste combines milk chocolate and something reminiscent of vanilla baby custard.  This is definitely only for those with a sweet tooth in beer--and, yes, it's available as a float with a scoop of ice cream. Public transit access only fair by Chicago standards.  Best way from the Loop would probably be the Red, Brown, or Purple Line to Belmont, and west to Hoyne on the 77-Belmont bus, then walk two blocks north to Roscoe.  Also located two blocks west of the 50-Damen bus line, which provides good connections to Piece, the Map Room, Resi's Bierstube, Fountainhead, Hopleaf, and Hamburger Mary's.",0.9962,0.774,0.187,0.038,0.5267703994119087

I like many things about this place but the food is not one of those things.  First off, it's a cozy little tavern.  We had a great bartender who knew his beer, they have tons of local beer on tap.  My husband and I went one night to watch his beloved college football team.  We went in and immediately asked them to put on his game, and they happily did so.  And there was a guy at the table next to us, he needed to watch the notre dame game and they accommodated him too with his own tv... Both men were happy.   Now the food.... I ordered fish and chips since I was craving some fried food.  The fish was fine/good, the fries were terrible.  Incredibly soggy with no flavor.  My husband ordered a burger and fries, he ordered it medium-rare and got well-done!  Again no flavor whatsoever and his fries were soggy too.  I decided not to eat any fries because at that point they were a waste of calories.   I like this place, I will go back... but not for the food.",0.9267,0.802,0.129,0.069,0.5574074074074074

2010-08-19,5.0,"The Village Tap is located right in the middle of my old stomping grounds. It's two blocks away from my Grade School and 4 blocks away from the house I grew up in. Other than a couple of years in Europe and a year trying to co-exist with the Seniors in the God's Waiting room that is Florida, I have been in this area my entire life.  I spent many a night destroying brain cells with the locals at this pub. I have many fond memories of sipping Bourbon, talking politics, the futility of the Cubs and even deeper topics like who was the hottest chick on the Facts of Life. The one thing I never did in all the nights of Liver Damaging, debauchery is order food at the Tap.   My wife and I stumbled upon the Tap on our Visit to the Retro on Roscoe Street fair. After dodging the strollers driven by  Yuppie Mom's, we were exhausted and famished.   The Beer Garden is just as I remembered it. It's cozy and welcoming.  The place was packed with people that were tanked up at the early afternoon Cubs game who wandered over to the fest.   For some reason, I had a major hankering for a Burger, so I ordered the Village Blue Burger. It's a generous portion of meat that is stuffed with Blue Cheese on the inside. The Burger was fabulous. The only other time I tried something like this is when I hung out with the Lawrence Welk crowd at Hackneys. The Hackney's burger was a Ass-Bomb from hell. The only good thing about Hackney's is that it gave me the chance to catch up on a lot of reading due to the fact that I spent two days in the bathroom after my meal there.  The Burger at the Village Tap was quite the opposite. It juicy and delicious, without the side effects.   The one thing that really impressed me was the service. I remember the day's where the servers at the Tap were so slow that I actually tried to go behind the bar and make my own drink. Our server was wonderful. Our food was out quickly and she kept our glasses full.   The bottom line is, I was impressed by my most recent visit to the Tap. The food was fabulous, the service was wonderful and it still has that Corner Bar vibe to it that drew me there many years ago. If you haven't been there in a while, I would give them another shot.

They'd be well served taking out a few tables and allowing more room for folks to mingle. That's really the only complaint I have.   Our waitress was fine but not stellar, food came out at a reasonable time, pretty standard bar grub.  I enjoyed the nachos, but not for eight bucks.  Thankfully the relatively affordable mixed drinks and nice beer selection made up for it.  The photo booth, for which I'm a sucker, was a definite plus.

2008-12-07,4.0,"A former co-worker would call Village Tap a ""sweater bar."" And you know what? That's just fine with me. I think it's her made-up term, but it gets its moniker for several reasons: * It doesn't have a menu full of froufy martinis longer than your arm * The beer selection outweighs the signature drink selection (I'm just guessing here, but I think it's a pretty safe bet).  * There is no DJ; they play a variety of music, including the Eagles.  * You can watch sports here * The decor isn't sleek or trendy and there is no VIP section or bottle service. * You can get real food here - burgers, chili, fries, etc.  * The people who come here don't dress up to be seen or make a fashion statement. To clarify, I'm not saying they look like slobs, I'm saying it's pretty normal to see most people in sweaters, jeans, or other casual attire (at least in the winter). So, why do I like this place? See above. I guess ""sweater bars"" are my kind of place. I'm not trendy or cool and I don't crave martinis with made-up names; beer is just fine with me. Don't get me wrong, once in a while I like to get dressed up and go to places with froufy drinks et. al, but that's more the exception than the rule if you get my drift. We dropped into Village Tap after our dinner up the street to have a few more drinks before calling it a night. I really loved the cute neighborhood feel about the place. We stood right near the fireplace, which kept us nice and toasty on a bitter cold Chicago night. If our one friend hadn't needed so much assistance staying vertical we would have been all over the photo booth.

Honestly, I just don't think it makes sense to be set up so much like a restaurant and not have table service. For instance, making your paying customers have to get up to have their empty drinks refilled in the middle of eating a meal annoys them, especially when it's busy and they have to stand around waiting to be served while their food gets cold. I will also complain, as many have, about the weird seating inside. The tables along the wall leading to the beer garden are just too tight. Part of the tight feeling has to do with the ridiculous choice of bar stools that are there: The backs of the stools are so wide at the top that they touch each other and make moving difficult.

You also get glares from the other tables if you even dare to move in your seat...since the backs of the chairs touch each other and therefore you must be annoying them. The prices seem pretty steep...was there last weekend, and for nachos, one order of horrid ""fish & chips"" (aka...overly dried fish sticks and fries), 2 vodka crans and 2 newcastles...the total was $67! But, if you just want to stop in for appetizers or a sandwich (try the guac chicken, turkey BLT or fallafel sandwiches...they were all really good!) and a beer or two it's a good place.
