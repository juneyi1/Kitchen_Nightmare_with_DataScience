Maybe removing one or two of the tables will force people to at least say, ""Hi, can I share this space with you?""   I have been here twice and have had an americano twice. Sadly each one had about as much personality as the chain cafe around the corner. I have since had my favorite beans flown in from home and continue to make mine in my apartment. Robust and full of flavor.  I don't blame this on the baristas either, not completely. Perhaps it's the bean they use? Or too long a pull ( makes the espresso too watery).

The cafe has a very small local neighborhood feel.  It is a small cafe with many smaller tables crowded in the sitting area.  Their offering goes beyond coffee and does include some baked goods and lunch offerings.   We ordered a cold brew and a dirty chai latte.  And with a quick service we had our drinks quickly crafted.  The cold brew was good as it wasn't sugary or overly sweet but allowed the true coffee flavour to shine.  The dirty chai latte was not as flavourful or tasty as Sawada but it is a solid option for this northern neighbourhood.  I found it to a day conventional sweet.  It's a cute little place and a great neighborhood spot but it's not a destination must do for Chicago.",0.9876,0.773,0.183,0.044,0.5307142857142858

After doing a little research, we decided on The Grind. After reading reviews, people said the house is small, so I decided to get there a bit early to snag us a table. She was running late, and I must have gotten there before the crowd - which showed up after she shortly followed. As I looked around, I noticed many people on laptops (note: there is wifi, but only for paying customers!), friends chatting, books being read, etc. Many seemed like regulars - just the atmosphere I was looking for. They have a nice menu of food, to my surprise. Many different sandwiches, salads, baked goods, and soups. I originally only was going for the coffee. As I waited, my stomach started growling, so I ordered a Mediterranean Veggie Sandwich. The vegetables were so fresh! It had cucumber, tomato, red onion, etc - and you could either have hummus or cheese on it. Obviously I chose the hummus. The sandwich came on lightly toasted multigrain bread and had a side salad next to it. You had two options of dressings - I chose the raspberry vinaigrette on the side. Alongside my meal, I had an iced coffee, which was also quality, although small - whomp whomp.  Boy, is this place a GEM of a find!!! Great atmosphere, quality food, awesome service (ok, I admit it took a bit long to make the food, but there were only two people preparing the food, the drinks, the smoothie, everything!

With a relatively quiet and subdued atmosphere, it's a great place to do work, as well as chat with the friendly servers and patrons. Because Old Town School of Folk Music is just down the way, The Grind also seems to be a meeting ground for musicians and artists. The place has a very open, supportive and compassionate vibe, due largely to the servers, who knew me by name by the second time I visited. Liam, a barista who I miss dearly, was a joy to talk with, always expressing genuine interest in my life and how the job hunt was going. When I obtained a new job and returned to The Grind after not having been a while, Liam even offered me a congratulatory drink on the house. Although space is relatively tight and can sometimes be limited, it contributes more to the communal vibe than anything else and has never been a real issue for me. Their sunny patio in back is a peaceful place to enjoy a good book and some iced tea. Since moving out of the Lincoln Square neighborhood, this is the place (and the food/drink) I miss most.

Very few places knock it out of the park. Monorail Espresso in Seattle has been my benchmark for years. There's something magical about the combination of their espresso and milk that is far and away better than most other places.

It was a nice change of pace to have a table all to myself. The only small setback and mean small is that they no longer have their poundcake. I swear that poundcake was the best that I ever had.

When it's springtime the outside patio is a lovely place, beautifully decorated. The bathroom is always very clean and smells nice.

One of my main criteria to asses coffee shops is the ability to sit there calmly for hours on end studying.

BREAKFAST RECOMMENDATIONS: Breakfast Croissant Sammitch with organic ham (divinely delectable);  Scrambled Eggs with toast (very simplistic)  Quiche of the Day (ask what it is -- it is rich, fluffy and fantasically fab-u-licious) LUNCH RECOMMENDATIONS: French Melt brie, honey, almonds, and cranberry on a buttery croissant, melted (this is my favorite one) -- the croissants are baked fresh daily (lusciously lovely with the sweet and salty combinations -- spot-on and oh so yum-yum);   Tuna Sandwich cucumber, tomato & greens on multigrain (very healthy); Caprese with pesto, tomato, smoked mozzarella & greens on ciabatta bread (served hot or cold); Italian Mediterranean with hummus, artichoke salad, feta, baked with cucumber & greens on ciabatta bread (my second fave); My Editor (a die-hard vegetarian) highly recommended:   The Med which is hummus, tomato, cucumber & artichoke salad on pita;  Veggie Dream cakes, tomato, onion, greens & hummus or cheese on multigratin bread (she described them as poignantly tasty -- she really enjoyed the hummus) Price-Point:  A little less than Panera Bread, but similar in prices. I recommend that you arrive at The Grind EARLY on Saturday morning (if possible before 9:00 a.m.).  Otherwise, you may be in for a long, long wait to get a table.  Also, it is a fairly small place.  Gentrification has definitely changed the neighborhood for the better.  My Editor recommended The Grind for several breakfast and lunch meetings.  I definitely plan to return again, on my own, and look forward to trying their scrumptious baked goodies and aromatic coffees.  UPDATE:  I made it back to The Grind over the weekend.  I ordered a latte with no sugar and one cranberry scone.  The coffee was robust and flavorful.  It was served in a huge white coffee mug -- beautifully presented.  The scone was a bit on the dry side.  I thought I was going to choke on it, but I managed to push it down with my latte.  The coffee was worth the price.  I would go back again for coffee, but will skip the scone(s).",0.9924,0.827,0.153,0.021,0.4653703703703704

He's the one who said, ""form ever follows function."" His most brilliant work was done when he was young, as he was possessed of an intolerable personality, worsened by drink, he got less and less work as he reached what should have been his most productive years.  Near the end, he got a minor commission do design the Krause Music storefront, probably in part because the owner pitied the once great mentor of Frank Lloyd Wright.  It was just a small storefront, but working feverishly with the knowledge that this would be his last project, Sullivan went way, way, way over the top, trying to include every architectural idea he ever had into the Krause Music storefront.  The result wasn't artistic, it was, well, ludicrous.  It's a very interesting and historic reminder for anyone trying to work on a 15 minute speech, don't try to throw in every brilliant idea you ever had, instead, get some perspective and make your statement fit the space.  So, if you have to work on a brief speech, hop on the bus, and come down to Lincoln Village, check out the last Louis Sullivan, then get a coffee at the the Grind, and make use of their free WiFi, look up the story of Louis Sullivan online, then finish composing your speech, grab a bottle of bubbly next door at the Fine Wine Brokers so you can celebrate after your speech.  If you're the best man, avoid the temptation to try to embarrass the groom, keep it respectful, and for the love of all that's holy, don't stretch it out to 15 minutes, make it 5 minutes, tops.",0.9945,0.795,0.17,0.034,0.442390289449113

2009-10-13,4.0,"""Would you like to open a tab?"" While I hesitate to begin my review with the one issue I had with this establishment, please keep in mind that this was, in fact, the only issue I had with The Grind.  Apparently they are not fond, as the barista told me, of accepting credit cards for a low total purchase. So my lonely Americano was almost accompanied by whichever random pastries I could tack onto my bill, until the barista said that it was ok for me to order just a coffee.  While I am not bothered by this rule, it would have been nice to have a posted notification of this information beforehand. I cry easily, and do not like to feel semi-annoyed glares from waitstaff who are breaking a rule I did not know existed.  Since that is out of the way? I was very impressed by the vegan and gluten-free selections offered by The Grind. Several items from the menu, from spinach/feta pies to vegan chocolate cheesecake, were purchased. Not a single complaint was issued regarding any of the items beyond subjective differences of opinions (""the cupcake's frosting was too sweet,"" ""the flavoring in the pie was too spicy,"" etc.), and many noted that they would recommend The Grind solely because it offered a cozy atmosphere in combination with above-average cafe items and beverages.  The...intimate nature...of The Grind caught me a bit off guard. I was not used to sharing my table with strangers, so while my heart was temporarily warmed when I was a chosen table sharer? My instinct was to hiss at the innocent man and tell him to find his own space.  That is assuming this would have been possible. That visit, just like several subsequent trips, found the seating area filled to almost 100% capacity. This led to wonderful conversation eavesdropping, or my being made aware that perhaps others were listening in to my pseudo-intelligentsia warblings. Another area of note is the background music. The extremely eclectic selections were much appreciated. I doubt I have ever heard Atari Teenage Riot,  Lucinda Williams and Stevie Wonder played in the same venue at all, much less within the timespan of a few short hours.  I definitely plan on returning to The Grind whenever I am in the area, and will likely make a trip to an ATM beforehand as to not ruffle any unnecessary feathers. While the staff struck me as incredibly nice overall, I certainly would not want to test this theory. I may end up listening to Miley Cyrus while slurping my way through burnt coffee.

Bright things are inside. I like the art and the artsy feel the nice baristas give off. The big board when you walk in tells you right where to head. I like not being confused or made to feel like an outsider, especially in a place as insular as the Grind. The vegan chocolate chip cookies (which are made by a local woman and which I haven't seen for awhile) are AWESOME and I like this because I'm not a vegan. But... prices are steep, people are ""shooosh""y (even half-glaring at you simply for ordering above library decibels) and the seating is crowded and on top of one another. If I feel like something different that supports my local businesses, I go to the Grind. If not, I head up to Dunkin' Donuts on Lawrence, spend $0.99 and work outside at Welles Park or at the Sulzer Library. At least when someone shooshes me there it's deserved.",0.9936,0.755,0.213,0.031,0.49214285714285716

Their salads are delicious. They've also got spinach pies from a Middle Eastern place on Foster. Your for-here mug gets a free refill.

2008-10-17,5.0,"Helpful suggestion on Ratings on Yelp reviews tells me that five stars mean, ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!"" and in my book, the Grind gets it right. It seems that the biggest complaint is about the seating, and I can see why -- the tiny tables are packed in the snug shop as tightly as they coudl be, and not only would you typically have to shuffle them around to sit and get up, but you'd have to be careful not to bump other people in the head as you walk about, if you are slinging a backback.  BUT, this type of sitting somewhat seems fitting for the cozy atmosphere at the Grind.  The exposed brick walls are lined with artwork of various sorts, and the street-facing side are large, airy windows.  The cafe will probably feel a bit stuffy on hot summer afternoons, but perfectly cozy in autumn evenings like this. Service is friendly -- they'd most likely greet you before you would -- and their small counter and display case is stuffed full of baked goods from reputable places (cupcakes from Southport Groceries, anyone?).   Best of all, coffee is good.  Having exhausted my caffeine limit for the day, I did the unusual -- ordered decaf --and braced myself for the typical sharp, bitter taste.  To my surprise, it was actually a very good cup coffee!    My only complaint is that there aren't enough places to plug in your laptop here, and unless you were sitting very close to one, the tight packing of the tables/chairs will make it pretty much impossible to snake your cable between legs without causing hazard. One final bonus -- this is probably the only coffee shop between Montrose and Lawrence on this stretch of Lincoln Square that has free wi-fi, until you reach Cafe Decartes at Lawrence.",0.9925,0.807,0.156,0.037,0.6357053571428571

I'm originally from the SF Bay Area - the land of great coffee and better coffeehouses.  When the Grind opened, I thought I'd died and been resurrected in my hometown - Berkeley, CA.  Its original owner - sweet Jenny - recreated in Lincoln Square the same atmosphere I grew up in.  Warm, casual, loose, but with an emphasis on great noshes and premium coffee.  (The tea's awesome as well.)  When Jenny recently transferred the ownership, you'd hardly have noticed.  The only change I spied were recycled-paper napkins and more vegan eats.  Even the staff stayed... The only problem with the Grind is its popularity.  In prime time, getting a seat can be difficult.  Yes, its wireless is popular, but the patrons tend to abide by the house rules - if you stick around, pay up at the counter.  Fortunately for me, I'm usually getting stuff to go before a class at Old Town. As for those vegan eats, fear not!  They're delicious.  The cupcakes are tremendous - and I've tried a lot of cupcakes in this city.  The cake is the moistest I've found.  If you want real butter icing, head up to Selmarie, but the vegan alternative could almost fool you.  Creamy texture, good flavor - better than those at Sweet Occasions.",0.9745,0.738,0.176,0.087,0.6414677276746242

I am a tea addict and the barista recommended what turned out the be a very robust and flavorful black tea.  As the tea is looseleaf, when I asked for two bags he said he would punch up the bag with two scoops for me.  Yes please!   I also ordered a scumptious apple turnover something-or-other, which was I was quite looking forward to when the bairsta offered to warm it up and bring it out to me.  After about 15 minutes sans apple turnover, I had to approach the barista and remind him I wanted my fat and sugar, which to his credit arrived immediately and was in fact warmed to the perfect temperature to really bring out the dessert's goodness and gooeyness.   The place was packed with people studiously typing away on laptops, enjoying small meals (the quiche looked amazing), and relaxing into good conversation.   The Grind also recycles, which is pretty spiffy in my book.

Yes, I said no need for sugar, for there is no bitterness because they actually know how to make the espresso properly.  Congrats Grind!  Plus, they make pretty lattes and I haven't really been to a place that makes pretty lattes (i.e. - leaf or heart designs on the top) that doesn't know how to make a pretty decent one.   It's the equivalent of pouring a bottle of beer.  You can either really mess up the top of it or really make it special.  The Grind makes it special and I love them for that.

2008-01-03,3.0,"Yes, The Grind is small and cramped.  Yes, you have to sometimes share a table with a stranger and yes, it's a bit pricey, but...it's an independent coffee house located on one the best strips in all of Chicago - the Lincoln Avenue shopping strip between Wilson and Lawrence in the Lincoln Square neighborhood. I don't go to coffee houses just for the coffee and baked goods - The Grind serves Intelligentsia which is fine coffee and a Chicago product, excellent pastries and, as pointed out a tasty if not slightly over-priced quiche - I go to coffee houses for atmosphere and amenities. It's The Grind's atmosphere and amenities that sometimes make me want to go there and other times keep me away. When I go, I go to work.  The place has a nice vibe that inspires me creatively.  I take my laptop, pull a wooden chair to a square, wooden table and I start writing.  I'm a writer, so I often bring a bunch of papers and notes with me to refer to when working on an article.  This means I have to spread out a bit which isn't usually a problem, though on occasion, I've had to pile everything up so another customer could join me at my table.   The Grind offers free WiFi, a nice feature which should be a staple of every coffee house.  I have WiFi at home, so this isn't the draw for me.  It is nice, however, to have the option of surfing the web when I need a piece of information for an article.   My guess is many of the customers here don't have internet access at home.  OK, we're all on a budget, but it I get a little annoyed watching customers with empty coffee cups spending hours IM'ing their web buddies while potential customers turn and leave, unable to find an open table.  If you're going to stay there a while, at least order a couple of things.  If you don't, then soon there won't be any independent coffee houses with free WiFi left. During the warm months, an outside table is fairly easy to get, especially mid-day.  Not only is the WiFi accessible outside, but the Grind's outdoor seating does an excellent job of providing one of my other favorite coffee house amenities, people watching.  If you need to take a break from your work or from your studying, this is a great spot to watch the world go by - often with their dogs and children in tow. There are two main things that sometimes cause me to choose other places over The Grind.  First, is comfortable seating.  When I just want to get out of the house and read or write by hand, I never choose The Grind.  There are no comfortable chairs or couches here, which is another amenity every coffee house should offer.  The seats are fine if you need to sit up straight and use your computer, but if you want to spend an hour kicking back and relaxing with the paper, don't go here.  Comfort is not an option.   The other factor which sends me elsewhere is the cramped space.  I understand just how difficult it is, with high rental costs and taxes, for a business with a slim profit margin like a coffee house to be able to afford a roomy space, that's why I give them more latitude with my critiques and support them when I can, but when I need to spread out a little, I make a different choice. I gave The Grind three stars.  If it offered comfortable seating, I'd give it four.  It's worth checking out.  A good place to grab a snack before or after a movie at the Davis Theater across the street or to sit outside on a warm day.",0.9976,0.818,0.159,0.023,0.5184444444444446

It's that creamy, light, sweet mouthfeel that is a perfect complement to good espresso...and if you don't understand that it takes time to create drinks this good, get out of the way and go to the Starbucks down the street while those of us who appreciate and know great coffee spend time knowing and appreciating our great coffee.",0.9945,0.665,0.313,0.022,0.5905864197530865
2007-11-16,3.0,"My vet sent me a thank you gift certificate for The Grind after giving him a glowing review here on Yelp so we decided to check it out after a vet appointment for our puppy since it was just down the street. We found a table outside and I went in to get some stuff. I ordered two slices of quiche and two coffee drinks. It was $18. $18 for coffee and quiche? Glad I had the $10 certificate. This better be damn good quiche for almost $6 a slice! Well it was. Really damn good in fact, however I think it was still over priced. We also had to ask 3 times for one of our coffees that the waitress was supposed to bring out to us. By the time we finally got it we were ready to leave. Overall it's a cute place but the service was a little lacking and I think it was overpriced. Ok though.",0.9137,0.835,0.135,0.03,0.5183760683760684
2007-08-30,5.0,"You know, I really love the Grind. I tried that newfangled cafe under the el, but there was NO comparison...it was filled with way too many Trixies - and since when did they start infiltrating Lincoln Square?! Yes, The Grind is small and no they don't have a ton of tables. Also, some of the staff sometimes overindulges in hairspray and angst...but it's a fantastic place. For everyone who is complaining about a lack of tables -- ask to share! Table sharing happens a lot here, and that's one great thing about this place. It really does help build a little community. People who work here regularly know each other and chat, the baristas have always been really sweet to me, and the pesto bagel is to die for.  In terms of food, the vanilla cupcakes, and the apple carmel squares (warmed) are fantastic. My only complaint is that the coffee often is a little acidic for my taste. And remember, next time you see me feel free to sit down and chat, I can't promise I won't be busy - but I'd love to meet you! :)",0.988,0.678,0.225,0.097,0.5448005698005699

2007-08-10,4.0,"I think a lot of the negative comments about the Grind that I've read are 1.) true to an extent and 2.) posted by people who would clearly be happier at the Starbucks that is just 3-4 doors down.  I'll admit, the place can get crowded -- most decent places do -- and yes, there is a policy in place that dictates table sharing, so you may have to sit across from a stranger. Are we really so jaded and entrenched in the fast-food culture that we can't handle waiting 2 min for a cappuccino to be made properly? Or some spinach and feta pie (get one, they're delish) to be warmed up?  I think this place is great -- and precisely BECAUSE it is overcrowded and loud and because the door doesn't seem to shut all the way, the ""greasy, goteed slob(s)"" that inhabit the place (I've never seen them...and I live right next-door.) or any of the other things that make this place an authentic experience instead of the cookie cutter, fast food, impersonal, just-add-water, insta-life places that you can find on every street corer of every major city in the world.  The coffee isn't the best I've had. It is enjoyable though, and I recommend the place to anyone who appreciates the quirks of the universe as opposed to seeing them as a distraction from the sterile and formulaic nature of one's modern life.",0.9297,0.817,0.122,0.061,0.47617157974300833

2007-07-12,4.0,"Several years ago I lived right around the corner from the Grind (before it opened) and I made a list of the things LS needed to make it complete. Two on the list were a new coffee house and an Indian restaurant. I went to Europe, and when I returned, both had arrived. Wow. I should be a neighborhood planner. Because I have been hitting up the Grind for caffeine fixes since the days when it was fairly empty, this place has a special place in my heart. I don't know why. Sometimes the baristas are so filled with ennui that it pains me to watch them muster up the strength to work, but whatever. The food is pretty tasty, though I think the coffee is brewed on the strong and bitter side. Not a fan of that, but my love for the cheese bagel and hummus edges out my dislike for a lot of their coffee. Nice selection of teas. Everyone has said it's crowded, and it is. I have a solution: Grind staffers, I hope you're reading! Turn off your wifi for the first couple of hours so that those of us who are not looking to camp out for the rest of the day can come in, enjoy some breakfast and hit the road. Then all you freeloaders can set up shop. I think this is a darn good idea. It's impossible to get a seat in the morning, but that's simply because people get there straight away to claim seats with their laptops.  Great food, okay coffee, fun place to hang if you have a golden ticket and can get a seat.",0.9938,0.762,0.195,0.044,0.5798042537172972
