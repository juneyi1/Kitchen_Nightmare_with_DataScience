2017-09-03,1.0,"This is one of those bars that has a tight knit feel to it. That is to say, the servers are unfriendly, slow to take your order and quick to get irritated when you ask a (any) question.  Bad service is one thing, but they also support bullies who physically threaten people all while while they're blacked out drunk.  Instead of kicking out the bullies, they ask them to calm down, even after violence has been clearly insinuated.  I've been here a couple of times before, but it feels like this is the last piece of the puzzle in figuring this place out. When an unprovoked 6'6, 45 year old man that everyone knows all staff by a first name basis can come and intimidate customers simply because he feels like it, that's an establishment to be avoided.  I seriously thought I was going to have the call the cops to get out of there in one piece.  But I quickly or ordered an uber  and jumped in the car before anything could escalate.  Be wary of this bar after 11:00.",-0.7876,0.792,0.082,0.126,0.4525793650793651

We finished our waters and never had an opportunity to ask our server for more. She never checked on us or asked if we needed anything else.

2017-06-21,1.0,"Was excited to try this place after a game of sand volleyball at North Avenue Beach.  It was crowded with other post-sports teams, so I won't go into detail about the slow service or missing appetizer, because I understand that stuff happens on busy nights. The reason I won't be back is because one of the men in our group was called an a**hole by the manager when we pointed out that one of the entrees was missing.  The manager got really frustrated and claimed it was the burger with an egg on it, NOT the burger with goat cheese on it that was missing.  Mr. Manager made sure to put his finger about 2 mm from Goat Cheese Burger to point out that it was goat cheese NOT AN EGG on this burger and that Egg Burger isn't at the table.  But it was my friend that was an ""a**hole""... The missing burger came out about 25 minutes later, after the rest of us were done eating, but not before Mr. Manager decided to yell ""SHUT UP"" to our entire table as we discussed the night's absurd events. A different man (another manager?) felt sorry and told us we could leave without paying our bill.  He was really nice.  That night, a girl in our group reached out to the owners about these events, and they graciously offered her a gift card - unfortunately we won't be going back for another Shut-Up-It's-Goat-Cheese Burger.

There were multiple times when we all had empty drinks and wanted another. One of us even made eye contact with the server to come over and she didn't come. I was a server so I understand being busy but at least let us know you'll stop by in a few. The food was also very scattered. One of our members got their food like 20 minutes before the rest of us and we all ordered together. We are planning on trying it once more this week because it could have just been a bad night.

Came here on a Tuesday night and their Tuesday special was a $7 pub burger. Cool. My friend and I each ordered one: mine medium well, hers was well done. Both with Irish cheddar cheese. 4 innings of a Cubs game later (Oh I came when the Cubs were in the playoffs and it wasn't crowded - should've been a warning sign) and our waitress chased down our burgers. But they weren't ours - they served us the wrong burgers. Manager came over and took our plates away. 10 minutes later he returned with our burgers and said he would take them off our tab. Cool.  I bite into the burger and it's cooked how I wanted - because I think they microwaved my burger. Fries were cold. Burger texture was weird and completely flavorless. And you couldn't taste any of the cheese. So basically you are paying 7 dollars for the privilege of them heating up a quarter pound of ground beef in the shape of a patty. Because they didn't add any seasoning. Ask for our checks once we finished - it was like 9:30pm and we were starving otherwise we probably would've sent it back. The burger was silk on the bill. After some more back and forth with the waitress, we finally get the burgers off the bill and only pay for our drinks.

The weather was nice, our waitress was nice, and the manager who helped take our order was friendly and entertaining.  But the food? Yeah, no.  I'm not a Bloody Mary person, but I know what they should look like. Five or six people in my group ordered them, and they came out looking like iced tea. I don't think anyone made it more than halfway before ordering something else. Once I saw that, I ordered beer in a bottle. As for the actual food, never again. I ordered the chicken nachos, which were literally the worst nachos I've ever had. The chicken was some sort of pulled, sodium-ladened monstrosity doused in cheese, some of which was melted, some of which wasn't. The guacamole on the side was tasty, but that's it. I ate about half this dish - only because I was starving - before passing it along to two guys in my group who ordered salads. They were not impressed, either, eating maybe two nachos apiece before pushing the dish away.  As for the rest of my group: One girl got a turkey burger, which she said was a ""5 out of 10"" and did not finish, and three people got burgers. One guy who ordered a burger stopped after three bites. The patties were clearly frozen and didn't look very flavorful. All in all, this was probably the worst collective dining experience I've had in nearly three years of living in Chicago. I didn't come here expecting five-star cuisine - or anything close to it - but calling what we ate ""bar food"" is an insult to ""bar food"" establishments everywhere.

2015-12-03,5.0,I am amazed this placed is rated more highly.  I lived in chicago for 4 years and this was my favorite bar.  Its a traditional irish pub and more!  They have specials on food/drink daily on a rotating menu/schedule so you can always get a deal. My favorite food here are the wings.  The things are bigger and juicier then typical wings and have a great crispy exterior.  The other dishes ( I have tried almost all of them) are really good as well and all can be had for a very fair price. If you are looking to grab a few reasonably priced drinks and some finger food or even dinner this place is great spot. A favorite of mine is the seating area out back which is a beer garden like area.  This area is especially great during the summer to cool off and get a few drinks. The service here is also above average. The waitstaff make sure to get you order in and out asap which is much appreciated especially if you are in a rush just grabbing a fews drink before seeing a show next door.

I've had the wings, hummus, quesadillas, cheese curds, a salad (that has goat cheese in it and is quite good), mini burgers, and pretzels.

They have (what looked like) a bar in the back and plenty of tables/seats. We sat along the side wall, which was fine as we wanted something more low key. There are TVs outside, which seems a bit out of the character they are going for, but the sound is off so they are tolerable. It's a big place though, you should be able to stop in with any size group and be set. Bathroom: unknown Staff: Our waitress was normal. Not bad, not great. Drinks: Like I said, we just stopped in for a quick drink. We had beers and sangria (the beers were fine, the sangria was not to our liking - much too lemony for some reason).

The server stole our drinks (a few of us left full shots to get cocktails as to not take too many shots too quickly) when we went to the bar to order another to sip on. The bartender said it was our fault for leaving our drinks un-attend. When I explained that in the 30 minutes we had been there, the server hadn't come, he said it was because we had ordered our first round from him. When I said well, if she wouldn't give us drinks what can we do when she takes them when we stand up to order more. He said it was my fault for not ""watching"" my drink and he went to the busted drink stand, grabbed some drink, and handed it to me. I said I refused to drink a random drink that had already been disposed of. He asked if  I was accusing him of trying to roofie me. Which is inappropriate, and unexpectable. As a fellow bartender I would never make a customer drink a drink that literally came from the trash then bring up a date rape drug, making them feel already more uncomfortable. I kept calm and said I didn't think he was going to drug me but I didn;t know where that drink came from or where it had been. He finally agreed to make me my CHEAP WELL DRINK we had been discussing the whole time. I drank it but gave him a low tip after everything I had been through. He chased me down after I left and told the bouncer I wasn't allowed back in. AFTER MY DRINK WAS STOLEN AND HE BROuGHT UP DRUGGING ME WHEN I ASKED FOR A REPLACEMENT. It's disgusting and appalling.

I started off by sampling the Affligem Blond on tap and really liked it, so I ordered a full goblet of it. It's a good option if you're into banana-esque Belgian Blondes. Part of Crunkmas tradition includes doing a shot reminiscent of a grasshopper. They only had certain shots on sale when we were there, so we tried to figure out what would be the closest to that. They had one called the Clit Lickin' Cowgirl #2; however, we were bummed to find that they were out of peppermint schnapps and a few other alcohols that we were interested in. Instead, we decided to create our own shot similar to the CLC2. It was made with Bailey's Irish Cream, crème de menthe, and Goldschlagger. We named it the Cockring Clit Girl #3 (whatever that means), and it just didn't quite hit the spot the way the listed drink might have. Our total came to about $60, which isn't bad at all for how many people we had and the various drinks we got.

The menu descriptions sounded great - including mac & cheese with toppings, grilled cheese with bacon, ham with arugula and gouda... but what a huge disappointment.  The grilled cheese looked like the plastic type you probably ate as a kid with a mealy tomato where more cheese should have been. The ham & cheese was ONE measly slice of ham with 2 pieces of SPAM - I kid you not!! - and the so-called gouda and arugula had no flavor at all. I would not serve any of this food at my house, even to young kids. Flavorless, questionable quality. I'm sure their food costs are low but this was ridiculous.

I was here for a birthday party a few weeks ago and it was great. They rented out the entire coach house and had a $30 drink package from 9-12am I believe. Bartenders were nice and it was quick to get drinks. I would highly recommend this place for a party. I came back this past weekend. Other places we tried were packed... 90 minute wait at Old Town Pour House? Yea right. No tables at Benchmark so we ventured over to Corcoran's. Always a solid bet. It was during the NCAA basketball tournament and a Friday night so it was understandable that most places were packed but we were happy to see that Corcoran's had tables available in the Coach house out back. These tables were small and kind of tucked away in the corner, but there was still a great view of the TV's for the game. Not too bad for going out at 8pm on a friday. We drank and had good times. We also ate and I got the Corned Beef Sandwich with a side of Mac and Cheese. It was pretty good and filled me up perfectly. The mac and cheese was a little bland, needed salt. Could have done without the mac and cheese for an extra $2+ but who can resist mac and cheese when they are drinking?  I'd definitely come back here, it's a smaller and quieter option to the other bars in the area. Probably wouldn't come here purely based on the food though.  Oh and our waitress seemed pissed to be working, she started out pretty good but quickly fell off. She didn't write down any of our food orders, which annoys me but nothing was messed up.

I like my husband are not super uptight about service or think it's something that is the number one reason we go somewhere we go out to eat to enjoy a good meal but even I have my breaking point.  So my husband & I headed over to Corcorans for a late lunch & a few Bloody Mary's. Since it was still sunny & nice we decided to sit outside. We sat down our waitress came & took our order. Mind you this was done at 2pm. We drank our Bloody Mary's. I had one then my husband had a second. The table next to us (4 people total) showed us 20 minutes after us and quickly received not only their drink orders (2nd round) but also their meal came VERY fast.  By this point 45 minutes went by and we still hadn't received our meal or have seen our waitress. A full hour went by & my husband went to feed our parking meter while I TRIED to flag down a waitress. I got the bartenders attention then kindly told her we had been waiting a whole hour and wondered if our order was even put in. When I told her what we ordered she said ""oh I think I saw that in the window lemme go check."" My question was for how long was our meal in the flipping window! Our sandwiches come out, & I had to send mine back (I hate doing that & usually never do but after an hour of waiting I would expect it to be correct,) I ordered the sweet potato tots & got fries instead. Then 15 minutes went by and my order finally came back, cold. So was my husbands.   I got the BBQ chicken wrap, sweet potato tots which was  generic, cold, & flavorless. My husband got the corned beef sandwich, mac & cheese this too was  bland, cold & nothing special, the mac & cheese was flavorless & in fact tasted like it came from a box. The meal was very disappointing especially since we waited so long for it. I am willing to over look bad service in return for a great meal. In this case it was a bad all around. We got the bill & for $46 we were left a little annoyed given we waited an hour and fifteen minutes for two sandwiches, crappy service, & bad food. When you work 50+ hours a week & go to eat you expect a pleasant outcome. This was just a damper on our day off a waste of money & time.   I did take notice that the  place was not that busy & it seemed as long  you were ordering numerous beers, food, shots, & buckets of Miller Light you were served quickly & your order was correct.

Each time I have had a friend or league hype up the place and then they have ended up apologizing for the service saying that it's not normally like this, even though for me it is. The most recent was the evening of 3/11. I came in with a friend and we sat at the bar. Unfortunately we had sat in the dreaded section of the rude bartender. She was too busy flipping her hair and restyling it (no washing of her hands either!) to pay attention to us.  So we finally cashed out and went to a booth to possibly order some food because that wasn't happening at the bar. We then got the worst server possible. Took our order, came back with the check. That's all we saw of her. We tried multiple times to catch her attention for more drinks but it was for naught. The food runner was at our table more often than she was. But after she gave us the check she was hovering, waiting for us to pay. I've been there, stuck working late when I want to go out. But that is part of the job.  Previous trips have been based on a CSS football league where we sat on the patio and were ignored, even though this bar was listed as our sponsor bar. And previously a friend had the back room reserved for a party.

I feel if you don't place cheese on the burger, you should always mention that you don't, leaving little room for disappointment.  Enough of my little rant...the burger was i-ight.

2010-07-29,2.0,"The 'Grill' part of its name makes Corcoran's seem fancy. When I went a few years ago after a Second City show, it was divey inside. Last night I went for a date with my boyfriend and it seemed a lot nicer. Outdoor seating, a cleaner inside, a beer garden in the back and then a strange little ""party room"" or something behind the beer garden with another full bar and big open windows. Kinda cool. It only looks that way. I should let you know we only went because, when you sign up with Vaughan's for your birthday, you get a $20 gc. Since Mystic Celt, one of their other restaurants, continually disappoints, I thought we'd try the food here. When we walked in, quite a few waitresses ignored us. I don't stand like a lost puppy for too long before speaking up, so I asked a waitress if we could sit in the beer garden. ""Yep,"" she said with a chuckle AT us and only a slight tinge of annoyance. ""There are lots of empty seats so you can sit anywhere you want."" It's true. There were lots of empty seats. No sign to instruct us what to do, nor hostess, but lots of empty seats at 7pm. Should have known. We sat and were greeted by our very nice waitress. She told us that the Blue Moon drafts special we had come for wasn't applicable because all the taps were broken. We ordered $4.50 Miller Lite bottles and chips and salsa and gagged instead.  The chips came out unsalted, a little chewy and generally stale with a salsa that reminded me of something... It took awhile, but I realized it was Jewel brand.  When our food came out, his quesadilla was just OK. My caprese salad was not. I asked for the salad with no oil, vinegar on the side, and please not the balsamic vinaigrette dressing on the menu. She looked as though she had memorized it, but it came back coated 3 inches thick in olive oil. If I had ASKED SPECIFICALLY for olive oil -- LOTS of it -- this still would have been overkill. It also had the dressing I didn't want, so I sent it back. Our waitress was perplexed by the mix-up and totally apologetic. She and the nice waiter who, unprompted, removed the umbrella that was blocking our view of each other are why Corcoran's rated even 2 stars.  The salad came back fine, with no olive oil (or seasoning) and the balsamic vinaigrette on the side. I decided to cut my losses and dug in. The salad consisted of one whole tomato cut four ways, lazily, with four hunks of once-fresh, tasteless mozzerella on top. I can see why they drenched it in olive oil. These quarters of tomato were hard. Crunchy. Unripe, I finally figured out. Miserable, I just ate the cheese, went home and got a stomach ache. How do I know I'm not crazy or over-picky? When we walked back through the restaurant to leave, I saw my original salad sitting in the kitchen with fork and knife lying there and about two bites gone.

I guess I can take it back... if you want' and then 'the guys in the kitchen tend to overcook the meat'.  If you know this, why not mention it to the woman who orders her steak medium rare? My friend decided to just eat the meal, since I'd already got my order and she didn't want to watch me eat. Understandable.

Obviously, this woman wants us out of there.   She stops asking if we want anything, and after taking my plate, she slaps down the bill.  Gee, it's not like we wanted to order more drinks or anything.  So we get waters, and then refills because dammit it's hot, and we're parched. She comes up to us and goes sarcastically 'More water ladies? It's free after all'.  Um, bitch please - we'd  be buying drinks still if you hadn't thrown our check down without us requesting it. Just because we ask for a water each after drinking 2 vodka tonics doesn't mean we're done for the evening.

Our server was very nice and she left us alone for the most part which was fine, but when it came time to give us the bill she was kind of slow with it, so I just decided to get my change for the $20 bill I had on me from the bar tender, who was super cool about it. All in all, this is a great place to stop in at if you're in the area looking to warm up or have a funny night planned at Second City with good friends.  I  would also be interested in coming back when the weather is warmer to check out their outdoor beer garden with the sun beating down on my face.",0.9934,0.719,0.226,0.056,0.4931623931623932

Several tables flood the rear with options for larger parties. Past the kitchen there is another outdoor patio and then another indoor bar. Pretty cool actually. Really nice set-up.

2009-11-25,3.0,"I've always had a good, if not interesting, time here, but I think that's primarily on account of the people I've been with, not the place.  My favorite Corcoran's memory is of a former co-worker hitting on a guy, while the entire patio looked on in horror. To be polite I'll just call it a failure of epic proportions. Said overserved co-worker then went on to hurl insults, complete with hand gestures at a nearby table. Fortunately, that table, fresh from their Second City class, thought she was hilarious and didn't want to rumble. Good thing, since a black eye totally would've clashed with the outfit I had picked out for an important meeting the next day. Ah, good times...  Corcoran's outdoor space is really what draws me here. There's a patio out front, sometimes complete with curbside entertainment, and a small patio in back if you prefer something a little quieter. They've also added a detached back room, across the patio, which is perfect for smaller group events like a One Brick knitting event I attended. That room has its own bar and set of bathrooms so you don't need to traipse back and forth.  The food is ok, that alone wouldn't make this a destination for me. Last time I was there I ordered a quesadilla appetizer, hello peppers! It was decent and nice sized, but way overstuffed with fillings. While that may sound like a good problem to have, most people don't enjoy wearing their meal. At $8, I didn't find it worth the price. I would say if you come for the food, try to take advantage of the specials. I was bummed to learn after I ordered, that the Tuesday $5 burger and fries gave you the option of beef, turkey or veggie burger - much better deal IMO.

2008-08-03,1.0,"I don't understand why this place has such a high average rating. When I looked at the menu's I was first taken aback at how expensive some of the prices were for simple pub food. $9 for a plain burger and fries. $1 per extra topping. $.75 for cheese. $12 for fish and chips (and peas?) Drinks were also on the more expensive end. I decided that it would be fine as long as the food was good. The mimosa I had was good, albeit way to expensive even with the drink special. When the food FINALLY arrived I was disappointed to save the least. I had a paltry portion of french fries, and my turkey burger looked like a store bought patty that had been heated up in the microwave. At least the cheese and avocado I ordered came in generous portions. My friend ordered fish and chips for $12, and his dish came with two lousy hunks of cod. He subbed the peas for a ""vegetable medley"" which looked -- and probably tasted -- like they came straight from the frozen food aisle. In addition, the service was less than spectacular. The waitress had little to no conception of restaurant service. I'm sure she was busy, but she was a little clueless when it came to my table. On my way out, I saw a plate of nachos on somebody else's table, which looked like tortillas chips coated in plastic cheese, topped with what were supposed to be condiments.

2008-06-21,1.0,"I visited Corcoran's today for lunch, and be it safe to say I will never return again. When we arrived the place was not too busy (most of the tables were empty), but after we placed our drink orders, we did notice that there were only 2 waitresses. When our waitress did come back to take our food order, she did not write anything down. I do have experience waiting tables, and I know it is never good when the waitperson doesn't write down your order. So we requested an order of mozzerella sticks and a house salad for an app, and then we both ordered appetizers as our main courses (so we didn't order anything that should take an extraordinary amount of time). 45 minutes later, we still had no food, but nor had our waitress even come over to refill waters, refill our bloody mary's or reassure us about our food. Another 20 minutes later, after finally getting her attention, she returns to confess ""I'm so sorry guys, I completely forgot about your order. I don't even know what you got. Do you want your check?"" Again, I do have waitressing experience and I do know these things happen, however,not only did she forget about our food, she just completely forgot about us as customers. Nothing else was done to alleviate the situation on the restaurant's side. After, we went to O'Brien's down the street (yummy food, and they definitely do not forget their customers!), but while there, we saw a huge table of about 10 that we had seen go into Corcoran's after us, and we overheard them complaining about the same exact things we were. I will not be returning here due to their lack of respect and care for their customers.  UPDATE: A few days after this horrible experience, my boyfriend was checking his credit card account, and the waitress charged him way more than he had spent!!!!! We called the manager, and still have not heard back.....They should not have even charged us for the drinks in the first place, but charging us more is just the cherry on top... UPDATE 2: It took me a long time to come back to this for some reason. But they took off the extra credit card charges and I think they gave my boyfriend 25 dollar gift certificate to the 4 or 5 places that they co-own.",-0.3667,0.842,0.075,0.083,0.4566666666666667

When we got sick of beer, a few colleagues and I went to the front bar to drink booze (sort of a no-no until later at work functions). The bartender seemed pissed to be serving us. Strange, he was bartending... I get it, sometimes groups aren't fun, but we were not obnoxious, we ordered properly and we had one tab. I used to bartend, I know an annoying group when I see one, and we were not. So I say, ""Dumb"" to the crabby man behind the bar. I do say, ""Ho-lee shit,"" to the lady behind the bar.
