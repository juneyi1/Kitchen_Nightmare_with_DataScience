I pointed out that we had a 10pm reservation and showed my email confirmation. He said ""sorry, we're closed."" I again asked why the restaurant accepted a reservation for a time when they would be closed? He said he would get the manager, which he did, and the manager said, ""sorry, we're closed.""

The scallops were cooked well but were a bit salty imo. The Caesar salad was not good. It was a lot larger than I expected but the dressing was non-existent and the croutons were crappy.

Thinking it would be busy on a Saturday night, my wife and I made reservations and arrived a few minutes early. We maneuvered our way through the hotel and into the bar for a pre dinner drink, that never happened. There were two people together at the bar chatting up the bartender, with no one else in the entire bar area. The bartender looked at us, didn't acknowledge us at all, and went back to his conversation. So we stood there for a few minutes, totally ignored. The host/hostess stand appeared to have no one appointed to it. After a number of minutes of us just standing there making small talk, I asked the waiter walking by if there was somebody who could sit us down, so he did it himself. This is when things started to get really strange. The same waiter who sat us, advised that he would take our orders. Understand, the restaurant appeared only half full/empty, and it took an unusually long time to get our drink orders filled (simple stuff, glass of wine and a gin and soda), the waiter then appeared really irritated when my wife simply asked that there be no mushrooms in her risotto. The orders came out, my risotto was ok, I've had  better, but her risotto arrived and, in my opinion, it was just straight up bad, no other way to describe it. Im not a chef, but I can venture to guess that we weren't the first customers that asked for no mushrooms. So she ate very little of it, and the waiter arrived back at the table and copped some attitude ""what...you don't like it"". Not in a questioning her as if to help her out, but in a snarky insulting fashion. At that point, it was time to go. We ran down the street and ate another dinner. In fairness, the place looks cozy and romantic, fireplace etc, which is worth a couple of stars , but the bizarre evening we spent there will likely prevent me from ever returning.",-0.908,0.832,0.074,0.094,0.4072751322751323

The menu showcased seasonal ingredients, and the wine list was simply perfect to select from for the food offered.  We sipped Coppola Pinot Noir which was reasonably priced and familiar. Though the wine service lacked enthusiasm and knowledge.  The meal began with veal meatballs and mushroom bruschetta; both delicious and perfect portion sizes.  Chef Steve's short ribs and polenta was a dish that I wanted to savor for many moments.  In fact, I may or may not have licked the plate clean.  The tasty and tender meat melted into the creamy polenta.  Truly soul food and a dish worth spotlighting.  If you saved room for a dessert, indulge in the tiramisu for a pleasant finish.   A lovely Chicago Restaurant Week prix fixe experience that left me craving a return to taste the remainder of this season's menu.   Fornetto Mei is definitely worth considering as your next spot for a romantic date, a small celebration or an intimate conversation with a friend.",0.9946,0.8,0.2,0.0,0.5269999999999999

We made same-day reservations through Open Table for a Friday night at 8:00 pm, although it seemed they had available tables even without the reservations.  -----  Location - tucked away and intimate:  The restaurant is in the back of the Whitehall Hotel - the signage wasn't so clear, but the staff were helpful and it felt like a bit of an adventure finding it. The setting is simple but quiet and good for a nice conversation.  -----  Cuisine - tasty and simple:  We started with the beef carpaccio with micro greens, capers, and sea salt. The sea salt was a lovely crunch, the carpaccio was soft and delicious. I would definitely get it again. It isn't served with bread, so we had to ask for it, but ate it on its own and would probably have it that way again, it was so good. For the main course, we both had beef short rib with creamed polenta. The flavor was lovely and I ate it easily. I could tell my friend was a bit put off my too many soft textures, so it could be accompanied with something crunchy for people with similar sensibilities. For dessert, I had the lava cake, which had a nice flavor and came with a good raspberry sauce. It could have been more melty in the center. She had the tiramisu, which also had a good taste, but after all the rich and soft textures, it was probably a bit too much for her.  -----  Drink Selection - choose wisely:  We had a bottle of the lowest cost chardonnay, which wasn't a great choice, and the wine service left a bit to be desired.  -----  All in All - great spot:  All in all, this was a great value for a solid meal that I wouldn't hesitate to repeat.

2016-01-23,4.0,We decided to kick off restaurant week at Fornetto Mei which we probably would have never checked out because it's pretty difficult to find. It's inside a hotel so we didn't see the name until we walked inside the hotel. Aside from that the ambience inside is really nice and the music they were playing yesterday was just what we were looking for. A little Billie Holiday and Frank Sinatra. The pre fixed menu had some really interesting choices and we decided to go for the veal meatballs and the mushroom bruschetta for our appetizers. We scarfed them down so fast I didn't get a chance to take a picture of them. The meatballs were amazing and the bruschetta was good also but it had a little too much raw onion on it which overpowered the flavors a little more than I would have liked. For our main course we went with the bolognese and the polenta with braised beef. The bolognese was not all that. It lacked seasoning and was just bland. I consider myself a little bit of a salty person but it just had no flavor to me. The braised beef on the other hand was really amazing. The polenta was nice and smooth and the gravy on top of it just brought it all together. Let me also say that the service was phenomenal. Our server was very attentive and checked up on us enough times where it wasn't annoying but where we felt like we were actually being taken care of.  Lastly we had the lava cake and the tiramisu. It had to be one of thee best tiramisus I have had in a long time. The lava cake was also good but that tiramisu!!!!! Yum!,0.9937,0.811,0.171,0.019,0.5830862713675214

My friend had The Netto, an interesting combination of sausage, grapes and goat cheese, while I had a gourmet Pepperoni with taleggio instead of mozzarella cheese. It was good, though the crust is very thin and crunchy and has none of the soft, airy goodness I like in traditional Italian pizza. But, hey, I am Italian so maybe I am being over sensitive about this.  Service was very attentive, to point of occasional awkwardness: like asking 3 times if we liked the pizza. We did, but I wonder if they expected my opinion to be very different between the first, the second and the third slice... also minor glitch with the wine. The server forgot to point out that the deal was only for the house wine, so we chose a glass from their regular menu and, when he came and revealed the mishap, we were half way through our wine and had to reassure him we would pay for it nonetheless --- awkward. In the end, he graciously included the wine in our deal, but I still feel it was a bit unprofessional to ask.

I came on a Thursday night, and the place was practically empty...which I liked, I just wanted a quiet little Italian place to duck into after shopping. The decor was ok, just a little dark but not something that bothered me too much.  Because it wasn't particularly bustling with customers, my server frequented my table often to make sure everything was alright. The bad part about this restaurant by far is the food. I'm not sure that the other reviewers ate at the same restaurant that I did, or if I simply ordered the wrong thing...i don't know but my food was pretty gross. I ordered the seafood risotto, which is one of the more expensive things on the menu, but judging by the look of the place (which reminded me of the ""hole in the wall"" gems I used to go to when I lived in Rome and the UK) I assumed the food would be worth the price. I was wrong. The risotto was a really off-putting color that even I could see in the darkness. It was a Kraft cheddar cheese orange towards the edges of the plate and yellow on the actual rice. Speaking of Kraft, it had the consistency of mac and cheese, which again is off-putting. The seafood was way overcooked and was the antithesis of fresh. I'm no food expert and I know I can't compare Italian food in Italy to Italian food in Chicago, but I've had better risotto from Olive Garden. Taste wise, it was ok--i managed to eat most of it (I was starving!) but the after taste was not so good. I'm just grateful I had a wonderful server who made sure I had enough water to wash out the taste. On the bright side, it was a decent portion size... so value wise this restaurant is good.

Neither one of us was impressed, but we were already too low to be disappointed. The decor was dark and dated (I'd say late 80s, early 90s) with the shining gem being the bar area and the fire stove. I would have liked to sit at the bar... The bar tenders seemed sharp, it was empty, and it looked nice. Unfortunately, we were ushered to the dining room where I sat on a chair that threatened to break if I leaned back. To say that it wobbled would be an understatement. It was definitely a hazard. Our server was friendly (even touching me kindly on the back when taking my order), but too spread thin to be attentive. It wasn't his fault. I think he might have been the only server. We mused that he might have been selected as the server because his English was the best out of the other staff. We had an amusing situation when M asked a staff member for another glass of wine and he simply brought her another glass (sans wine). Eh - he tried. The food was unimpressive. The beef carpaccio was tasteless (completely overwhelmed by the arugula and bread) and had a slimy texture. The margherita pizza was bland... Something just wasn't right about it and we couldn't quite place what. My gnocci with oxtail was the shining star of the evening, but it didn't have enough oxtail. After two glasses of wine, one glass of port, a martini, and the food mentioned earlier, our total bill came to just under $100. We were surprised by the bill considering the quality of the food and experience. We decided that it was our alcohol that jacked the price.

From the flavorful soups to the crispy-thin Milanese pizzas to the artfully prepared pastas, this place knows flavor. I have never been disappointed, and neither have my guests. In my estimation, Fornetto Mei is one of the most comfortable, relaxed, yet upscale places to dine in the Gold Coast. It's impossible to remember that they are housed within a hotel:  I swear whenever I go in there it feels like a familiar neighborhood gem along the lines of Antica Pizzeria (see my pst about that Andersonville treasure).

2011-05-17,3.0,"We went to Fornetto Mei for breakfast on one of those Spring mornings when you really don't want to get out of bed with a chill and rain in the air. But once we were seated next to the fireplace, all of that faded.  Surprisingly, while the Whitehall hotel that this sits in was packed with people checking out on a Sunday morning, this restaurant was quite empty. I walked through a couple of bar areas (they looked like nice places to cozy up with a loved one with the soft couches nestled in little nooks) and finally found my way to the dining area.  The menu is not large- more functional but with the favorites that everyone is looking for: omelettes, Eggs Benedict, crepes and more basics like eggs and bacon and oatmeal.  Our server was quick with the coffee and our food came up pretty fast and was pretty good as well. My omelet was well put together and they substituted fresh berries for the potatoes that usually come with it for no charge.  The mis steps were more in the service areas. Coffee refills were slow to come (and I'm a girl who needs her coffee), butter came out with the toast instead of jam. And my biggest gripe? A larger group left and they started moving the furniture around adding a table to our two top to make it a four top (and also the corresponding chairs) which just felt like that should have not happened until we left our table. I felt like I was in the middle of ""change over"" in the restaurant while what I wanted was a leisurely experience.  Prices were reasonable for the area with breakfast running about $50 for the two of us. If you drive- try the parking garage across the street or you may wait a long time for the valet especially on a Sunday morning.

2011-03-21,4.0,"Very simple menu. The place is supposed to be an asian/italian fusion. However, only the appetizers contain the asian. But, this is not to say that the Italian was not good. Their old menu had an item that was a crab and shrimp pesto pizza. When we went there, that had been replaced by a chicken pesto pizza. We asked if we could get the crab and shrimp pesto pizza but they did not have any crab but could make a shrimp pesto pizza which we got. The pizza is cooked in a nice brick oven and hand made in front of everyone.  Well. The shrimp pesto pizza was unbelievable and probably the best thing that we had gotten. They made a cream sauce that was put on top of the pizza which complemented it perfectly.  The pizza was an appetizer and was ordered along with bruschetta and grilled calamari. I really like it when a restaurant puts the calamari on top of a bed of spinach salad. However, the only problem here is that there was not enough calamari which was a real downer. The bruschetta wasn't bad either. The waiter had recommended it but I probably wouldn't get it again next time. I ordered the Gnocchi for the main course which was very good.

2011-02-19,1.0,"Without a doubt, Fornetto Mei is the worst restaurant in the Mag Mile/just south of Gold Coast area. The bulk of the Yelp reviewers seem to have eaten at a different restaurant entirely. The one even somewhat positive aspect of the experience was the passable service--i.e., no drinks were spilled and the waitstaff was attentive.  But, decent service does not make up for abysmal food. My dinner companion and I were seated immediately, near the windows looking out onto Delaware at about 5 PM in the nearly empty restaurant. Perhaps, it was our mistake dining in the daylight, but the shabbiness of the space that might have gone unnoticed after the sun went down, was undeniable and distracting frankly--carpet and furniture that hadn't been updated in years, noticeable filth (may have been wear and tear) in the corners, and a really ugly vent in the otherwise tolerable front windows. Also, the silverware was quite spotty, assumedly due to poor polishing or no polishing.  I'm more of a food guy, so I can see past shortcomings in ambiance. However, the most important component of any dining experience--the food--was the worst part. We did not order much, two salads, a pizza, and a pasta dish. The salads were very casually thrown together and the quality of the ingredients was bad enough that I thought to myself: ""Hm, I can't remember the last time I ate produce this bad, and at home I frequently eat veggies well past their sell-by date..."" It was like eating a salad prepared with bargain bin components by someone completely unconcerned with presentation or attention to detail--maybe it was a bad day for their food distributor. The pasta was the highlight of the terrible meal--exceptionally boring linguine with chicken, noodles only slightly overcooked. But really the reason I'm writing this review at all is to attempt to set the record straight on the 'amazing pizzas.' We ordered a seafood pizza that was to include shrimp and crab with pesto sauce and red bell pepper puree. Fine. I did not expect to be wowed, I guess, but I honestly thought someone was playing a joke on me. The shrimp were the tiny kind found in cheap Chinese take-out shrimp fried rice (i.e., low quality) and the crab was blah. The pesto sauce was fine. But the kicker was the fact that the pizza crust was suspiciously similar to that of cardboardy cheapest frozen pizza crust. All my dinner companion and I could do was laugh and think about ways to significantly improve this (frozen) pizza with a better frozen pizza and better ingredients for the same price at home. I was shocked.  With all of that being said, I enjoyed the time spent with my dinner date, despite the meal, and I believe Fornetto would be an OK choice for out-of-towners looking to have a sit-down dinner for a fairly reasonable price in an otherwise ""culinarily"" very expensive area of town.

So if the food was good, why the two stars?? We should have known better when we walked in and it was quite warm, although we gave them the benefit of the doubt since it was a 90 degree humid day in chicago.  As they prepared our table we all started sweating and inquired about their AC, and the manager sheepishly admitted that they had someone working on their AC at the moment, and offered to seat us on the screened in patio where there was a nice breeze.  The waitress, although a seemingly sweet woman, had to be reminded for soda refills and forgot to enter our calamari appetizer order.  The blame is hard to place on the waitress, the chef and the manager for the next set of complaints but the entrees were brought out all different times, so two had no choice but to eat before our food came out.  My pizza apparently fell on its way out from the kitchen so they brought out my pizza after everyone had finished. And they didnt mention it until a few minutes until after it had happened, as though they were trying to cover the mistake before we noticed. When we recieved the bill we sort of expected to be compensated for the missing appetizer, the late food, or the practically missing pizza that - but that was not the case.  The icing on the cake was when the manager mentioned that their credit card machine was broken and they would need to write down all our credit card info - which was frustrating for two reasons.  If they knew it was broken, they should have disclosed that before we sat down for dinner (as well as the AC), and moreso because in the age where idenity theft is a very real issue, having someone copy down your entire credit card info on scrap paper is slightly unnerving, especially for out of town guests.  When the manager started fussing over the bill, and I told him we were sort of in a rush, he snapped at me that he was going as fast as he could So in summary decent food with some of the worst service I have had in a long long time.",-0.9443,0.802,0.084,0.114,0.4937634408602151

I really had no expectations for the restaurant when we decided to go here. Hadn't heard of anyone going here, and Asian-Italian fusion sounded a little odd, but we're willing to give anything a try. The atmosphere was warm, cozy and inviting. The fireplace was a nice feature of the area we were in.  My husband and I started off with grilled calamari and the crab cakes. The calamari was great with a balsamic sauce and a nice grilled flavor. The crab cakes were nothing out of the ordinary, but well presented.  The main dishes we tried were the 8 oz. tenderloin and the lobster/crab ravioli. We were a little surprised that my husband's tenderloin came out in chunks, but maybe I missed that on the menu? The ravioli came in a generous portion, was stuffed with filling and had a tasty sauce.  My only real bone to pick with this meal was the dessert. I ordered the molten chocolate cake and my husband had the tiramisu. The tiramisu was good-again nothing too special. kind of looked like it had been cut out of a sheet pan and put on a plate. The molten cake, which I normally expect to be warm and melty in the middle when it comes out, was not. I could tell they basically had the desserts lined up in back-cold. The powdered sugar was not really powdery any longer (it had sort of absorbed the moisture from the cake), and the inside of the cake was sort of cold and goopy. Not what you'd expect for a dessert they normally sell for $9 each on their non-Restaurant Week menu. We were glad we tried Fornetto Mei. The atmosphere was great.

Though I'm sad to say things were less than spectacular. Fornetto Mei bill itself as an Italian and Chinese restaurant, though not fusion. It's located at the White Hall Hotel and is walking distance from the Water Tower. We opted to sit near the pizza bar in the glass alcove facing the street. It's a nice area that, despite the heavy storm at the time, was still warm and pleasant. The servers had nice personalities but need to work on their tact a little more. There was some confusion at times and at one point we overheard them discussing our order without subtlety; it created an awkward moment.  I opted for the 'Mei's Handmade Postickers with Seafood', 'Pan Roasted, Dry Aged 8 Ounce Steak Tenderloin', and the Affogato for dessert. The potstickers had a nice crispy and yet doughy texture; the filling was about on par with the usual pan-asian places around the city. The vinegar dipping sauce was subdued and had a decent kick. All around not too bad. Then comes the salad... I mean steak. My entree's presentation was basically a shrub stuck on porcelain. There was a TON of arugula covering the meat and roasted potatoes, I had to eat my way through about a fistful until my protein and sides emerged. Now, I love my greens... and I love balsamic vinegar... but the whole thing was absolutely drenched in it. Not to mention my meat was also doused. I order the tenderloin cooked to 'medium', it arrived ranging from rare to medium-well at the tip. I love my meat cooked across all temperatures so it didn't bother me as much; though I know a lot of people would find that unacceptable. The potatoes were nice and had a slight crisp to the skins, the carrots also get a thumbs up. Andrea had the Berkshire Pork Bolognese, I sampled a couple bites and was left thinking ""meh"". The linguine was overcooked and the sauce a little under-spiced for my taste. Dessert was the Affogato. From the menu ""An 'Affogato' Coming from the Italian word for Drowned,  Consists of Vanilla Ice Cream ""Drowned"" in our Lavazza Espresso; Served with a Homemade Biscotti"". It's a neat idea but I found the ice cream to melt a little too fast. Not a bad flavor combination though.

The worst part was the food. My salad was incredibly disappointing for $8. I would have preferred a salad from Panera anyday over the Fornetto's salads. Despite the ""salad"" name, the only vegetable was shredded lettuce. No tomatoes, no onions, no cucumbers, nothing else! My friend ordered a turkey sandwich for $7 which came with no sides, and looked like it could have been made at home. The sandwich was supposed to have garlic aiojli on it, instead they slathered on lots of mayo. We ended with splitting one of their enormous cookies for dessert, which turned out to be stale and hard as a rock.  do not go here. do not be fooled by the american flag umbrellas outside.",-0.9532,0.795,0.061,0.144,0.6465773809523809

2006-04-17,4.0,"One of my favorite places to go in Chicago for a quiet, relatively inexpensive meal (unless you go crazy on the $12 cocktails). They have a full bar, and a great wine. I always sit at the back bar right by the pizza oven, where you can watch the pizza chef go to work. Their pizzas are excellent - all thin crust and in the $10-14 range, and the potsticker appetizers are great as well.  I love to try out new restaurants, but this is the one place I come back to consistently.",0.872,0.838,0.144,0.018,0.5315728715728716
2006-01-23,4.0,"Fine dining is possible for under $25 even on Michigan Ave.    You really don't have to bust out the big bucks to dine in style on the Mag Mile.  I'd say that one of the best kept secrets of the touristy, shop-aholic's paradise is Fornetto Mei, nestled discretely on a tree-lined street adjacent to the Whitehall Hotel.    A mere student, such as I, can get excellent service at a fab-o restaurant that has the right amount of pizzazz, delicious cuisine, attentive service, and money left over for some Mich Ave shopping.  The ambience is very warm and welcoming.  As soon as I step in, I face the bar and the star of the show, the wood-fire pizza oven.  The pizza chef always welcomes guests with a smile.   As soon as I sit down, a busboy will come out on cue with warm rolls and present me with the choice of chili-infused olive oil or the olive oil originale and freshly grated parmesan cheese.  I go through the motions of reading through the one page menu, but I'm usually set on the same old deal.  The spinach salad ($8-9) and a sausage and grape pizza or the porcini mushroom pizza ($10-$14).  The crust is the right amount of chewy and fluffy and the cheese is fantastic.  I could rave for hours on end about the fontina (porcini pizza) and goat cheese (sausage pizza) they use.  Just divine.   Their special chocolate dessert is fantastic - a molten flourless chocolate cake with ganache in the center.  It is the cheaper alternate to Roy's chocolate dessert and tastes just as scrumptious.",0.9903,0.849,0.151,0.0,0.45666950113378685
