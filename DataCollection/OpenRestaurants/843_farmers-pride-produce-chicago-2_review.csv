2017-04-19,5.0,"Looking at the storefront, you wouldn't know for sure even if it was operational. I moved to the neighborhood assuming I would have to shlep to Mariano's. Turns out, Farmer's Pride holds down the basics and beyond. The kind of store that you might take for granted in New York, but in Chicago is a real treat.  I've been falsely accused of shoplifting twice in my life, once at Whole Foods and another at Farmer's Pride. I was manhandled and treated like dirt at Whole Foods, but at Farmer's Pride they were totally cool when I explained what had happened, the cashier apologized, shook my hand and made it clear that he wanted me to return. I was booted out of the garage at Whole Foods even after it was clear I hadn't taken anything! That speaks to the difference a quality independent business like Farmer's Pride makes.   Consistently quality produce and a nice variety. They have a good blend of higher priced items & healthy stuff along basic staples.  Highlights: a bunch of different gnocchi, noodles + sauces, wide variety of coffee and big local beer selection, oats/grains/beans, frozen fruit, all the La Croix, squashes, almond butter, beyond basic produce like leeks + two varieties of kale, cheap nuts, variety of onions and potatoes, cornish hens in the freezer, simply OJ.",0.9921,0.736,0.216,0.047,0.4396589521589522

This beats walking around a giant grocery store for an hour, realizing you forgot something at check out and then having to run a quarter mile across a warehouse to get it. And in Logan, add another 30 minutes of traffic to get to any decent grocery store in the area with fresh produce and a deli counter.

The negative = the service is terrible. In just the past couple months, I've had these experiences: The guy who works there bagged two crates of eggs vertically with other things, which I didn't realize until it was too late. About half of both were broken by the time I got home (that's roughly $6 worth of eggs). I guess I can take partial blame because I didn't check, but I didn't think I would have to. Who puts a carton of eggs in the bag vertically? Just a few weeks ago, I was walking around the store with one of their baskets. A huge portion of one of the edges had worn through the protective plastic, and the very sharp and no doubt very dirty metal tore my palm open. I showed it to the girl and she basically said, ""wow,"" and offered me a paper towel. That was it. Against my better judgement, I went back today and bought a few things. It wasn't until a few hours later that I realized my old friend eggman had neglected to give me back the bag of apples he rang me up for. So, I'm out even more money but I guess I should be happy I'm not going to have to deal with my hand bleeding all week like last time.

It's not a big chain grocery (it's probably less a quarter of the size of the Dominic's down the street); but somehow Farmer's Pride manages to have everything I need.  I know the owner makes it a point of, well, pride; because he laughed and told me. 'We have EVERYTHING!' one time when he was able to point out the one obscure item on my list I was sure I'd have to look for elsewhere. A little while ago I heard someone on the radio recommending that, in order to maintain a healthy diet, shoppers should avoid the middle section of the grocery store, where all the frozen and processed foods are.  Ever since then, that's how I've thought of Farmer's Pride: as a grocery store that just eliminated the middle section.  You know, for our health. They've got your basic produce, snacks and dairy--and a lot of other treats like organic cereal, locally-roasted coffee, and heat and serve Indian entrees.  They've got the best butcher counter around, and have me cooking up animal-protein like a fiend (much to the chagrin of my vegetarian boyfriend).   So much to love about Farmer's Pride; but the best thing has to be the price.  I am always amazed how many bags of groceries I can fill for less than $20 at Farmer's Pride.  They always leave me with a little extra in my pocket for when I'm just too lazy to do the right thing and cook.",0.9946,0.746,0.215,0.039,0.3639924085576259

I appreciate everything about this cornerstore.  The first time here, I just stopped in to buy some fruit. I figured with the name ""Farmers Pride"", it would be superior to Stanley's Fruit Market. I prefer the quality and variety of fruit from Stanley's BUT this place does offer a decent selection of fruit, nice variety of cereals, European pastries, and there is also a deli department. Haven't tried the deli but will soon, it seems like a decent place to get cheese and sandwich meat. Oh and that aloe vera pulp juice is fun to drink/chew too. It's also closer to me than other stores, so I find it to be a good place for a snack/lunch on the run or mini grocery shopping.  I really dig their containers of fresh mixed fruit and hot soups. I was in line when I noticed the cardboard menu on the wall behind the register, listing the kinds of hot soups that they offered. Greek Egg Lemon Chicken? I like all of those ingredients and I've never tried it before so I had to give it a go and now I'm hooked.  I like this soup so much, I've researched recipes because I thought I may have to try to make it myself but nooo....those recipes had me at egg whites and they all seemed never-ending, just like my reviews. I'd rather just applaud anyone who knows how to make this soup that good and fork my soup money over when I need it.  I like that they also offer oyster crackers for your soup. However my most recent soup dine out experience did not go as planned. As usual, I crushed the package of crackers then emptied it into my soup, only to find out the crackers were grossly stale. It really offset the texture and taste of one of my top favorite soups, turning my big smile upside down, like so :( Therefore, I recommend testing your crackers out first before crushing and emptying the contents into your entire bowl of any soup or chili because ya just never know.

Their selection of The Republic of Tea tea canisters is amazing. Plus, it's a good $2-4 cheaper than other places I've found it. Produce is also much cheaper than chains and while everything isn't SUPER fresh, the items that aren't are severely discounted and you don't feel like you're getting ripped off ever.  Everyone is always really friendly and it's never too crowded either.

Very large selection of beans (dry & canned) and spices. And they even carry Dubliner cheese! Their only weakness is salad greens--don't expect to find much beyond spinach and lettuce.  They've recently started offering hot soup a la the Whole Foods hot bar, but I have yet to try it.

2008-12-30,5.0,My favorite grocery store in Chicago. They cram many diverse items into a small space.

I live closer to Dominick's but I will walk the extra block to go to this place.  Highly recommend it.  Stretch your dollar and support a great local independent store.",0.9895,0.709,0.256,0.036,0.4811263736263735

The meat is also cheap and good--they have Boar's Head meats and cheeses, and they offer sales. They recently expanded their non-perishable items.  Here you will find foods you might find in the ""ethnic"" section of chain super markets--but at half the price.  Ethnic, here, is not ""exotic"" as it is in other places.

2008-09-09,5.0,"I guess the cat is out of the bag on this place. I've been shopping here for a few years and yes, it has awesome produce and some sweetheart deal with the local Chicago bakeries (Turano, Gonella) that benefits the customer's wallet, but what really sets this place apart is the deli and butcher. Boar's Head products for a fraction of the cost that you would normally see at other delis, and decent second tier deli meats and cheeses as well. Honestly, how do you buy from a deli that offers Boar's Head and not get Boar's Head? Delicious. The meat counter is top notch. Freshly butchered chickens lead to the cheapest per pound price of boneless skinless breasts you will ever come across. Their pork chops, while thick and plentiful, never top out above $3.00. The ground beef is always dirt cheap and fresh, and steaks are priced the best around. My brother and I got a couple of two pound sirloin steaks for under $10. That's a lot of meat, and all 32 ounces of that cow were superb. Nick The Greek butchers as much of the meat as he can, in house, in order to keep prices that low, plus, that allows him to keep an eye on the quality as well. The less handling between the wide-eyed animal roaming the fields of downstate Illinois and the delicious slab of seasoned heaven on my plate is a good thing in my opinion. The perfect marriage between Ukrainian and Greek concessions for sale is another thing that will always top that sterile, low-rent Whole Foods they call Dominick's down the street. Just pick up any of the Ukrainian desserts or Greek cheeses and yogurts. You won't be dissapointed and you'll have broadened your horizons.  Win win.",0.9968,0.775,0.209,0.017,0.41774691358024696

2008-07-29,5.0,"Welcome to a study in the demographics of Humboldt Park/W. UKV as represented by food products: Produce is excellent, and centrally located in the store to serve everyone. Avocados and bananas are not expensive here, which tells you that the people who shop here don't find these exotic. You could eat your weight (and perhaps your height) in the tortillas they stock. Organic yuppie foods appear to be encroaching on the peanut butter and jelly section. Are yuppies pushing out families, or is that a sign they're bringing their kids? Random Greek foods like jars of tahini, baklava, and homemade spanakopita are scattered throughout the store. Greek is represented, but not organized to create a strong presence. The Italians seem to be divided as well, with a great selection of locally manufactured pastas, sauces, and gnocchi a store's-length away from the wall of Caputo spices. There's a bit of Eastern European food, but all signs point to turning around and heading back across Western to Rich's in Ukrainian Village proper. Even though your landlord told you this was West Ukrainian Village, be assured that you live in Humboldt. Ice cream is right up front.

Farmer's Pride is within walking distance of both my house and my work, so it is super convenient...and I am grateful for that. My true rating for FP is 3.5 stars. The produce is pretty good, especially the fruit. I've found the veggies to be kind of hit or miss, but I can usually find everything I need to make fresh salsa or guacamole in decent condition.

I'd do ALL my shopping here. The Greek selection is great, and most of the time their produce and meat are cheaper than at your neighborhood Jewel or Dominiks. There isn't a frozen area (except for a little case with ice cream), and the cold foods (milk, eggs, sandwich meat) are in an open-air space, which can be bad. A few weeks ago I bought some Heavy Whipping Cream and it ended up being curdled when I got it home. I imagine sitting in the open-air cooler probably did this. My other gripe is that the cheesecake they have is DRY and really unpleasant. Otherwise, the food is always fresh, the staff is friendly, and it's small enough you don't have to go searching for anything! They have fresh bread daily and their baked goods (kolaches, cheesecake, etc.) are made by a local bakery.  For a neighborhood market, it's pretty killer.",0.872,0.83,0.113,0.057,0.4829365079365079
