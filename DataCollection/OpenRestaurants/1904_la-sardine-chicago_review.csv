That said, it is certainly a slightly hidden treasure with amazing bread, seafood and steak frites. Ordering is never easy because there are so many great items to choose from.

2017-04-18,1.0,"-I have been going to La Sardine for the Tuesday pre fixe for about 17 years. Once a valet driver did not know how to drive my stick shift car and instead of saying anything caused it damage. He apologized but the clutch smelled of smoke. Next, I went there recently with an older lady. When I called back to make another reservation I was told I can't because the server had cleaned up ""defection"" from the bathroom, bar area etc. and assumed it was me. Interesting. I never went to the bar that night and I will be asking the owner for a copy of the receipt to prove I was at the bar... because I was not. I did not even wait at the bar. I walked in with the lady together and we immediately sat at the table. I called back and the person told me I could talk with the server but I asked for the manager. Instead a server got on the phone and said the manager was not available. Then, I asked for the manager to call me. Nothing yet. The food quality has gone down also considerably and now the price $35.00 pre-fixe without drinks is getting absurd given the quality of the food. They are often out of the wine I ordered and generally rush you along. I am also not sure if they assumed something because I am not white. I would not say this otherwise but once my white husband dropped bottle of wine knowing I was dining there with friends for a special occasion and the server stated one of our white dinner companion's husband had dropped for her... assumption much. La Sardine this is sad on many levels An update on this review is that since I posted Daniel the server (white male) addressed none of the other issues, I mentioned, the valet who caused the clutch on my car to smoke, the bottle of wine given to a white woman because it was assumed she was married to my white husband, the smoking of the staff in the kitchen ( let's talk about odor) and told me to look in the mirror and then said don't pull the race card. I think Daniel, you just proved my point. Also, write me again and I'll the consequences will be a letter from a lawyer. Still no call or message from the owner. If she called I would also address the smell of marijuana from the kitchen area.... explains all the server errors",-0.1761,0.933,0.031,0.035,0.3043015873015873

We had dinner elsewhere, but my cousins wanted to bring us to La Sardine for the amazing dessert after dinner. We were a party of 4 at 9pm on a weeknight, and the host sat us right away. We told our waitress we were there for dessert and she immediately left the table (mid-listening to our drink orders). The host immediately came back to our table and started snatching up our menus, apparently miffed we were not having a full meal. Meanwhile it was 9PM ON A WEEKNIGHT, not like there was a huge wait or it was prime dinner hours. We asked the host if we should sit somewhere else since he was giving us so much attitude, and he just said ""nope, it's fine"". Didn't even make eye contact with us. The waitress continued to be super cold to us our entire time, even though we ordered several rounds of drinks and multiple desserts. With the icy attitude as our side dish, we had a delicious chocolate souflee, creme brulee, ice cream and multiple cocktails and glasses of wine.

2017-04-07,5.0,"For a couple years I've been looking for a truly authentic and wonderful French brasserie in Chicago. Unfortunately, I was looking in River North, where there are quite a few choices, some good, but none wonderful. Then I stumbled upon this place. How I'd overlooked it I don't know, since it is just off of Randolph's restaurant row, but it is a bit of an obscure side street. Anyway, it's the real deal, with all the classic French comfort foods, impeccably prepared.  It's really the small details that make the difference: the warm, crusty French bread and sweet butter served before you even order; the exactly correct Dijon mustard that accompanies the country-style house-made terrine of pork pate; the croutons on your Salad Lyonnaise that have obviously just been toasted; the perfect crust of gruyere on the French onion soup; and of course the right ambiance and soundtrack to accompany a classic French bistro meal. In addition to the delights listed above, we also tried the mussels, a new recipe for the Spring, and they were easily the best I've ever had, done in a cream sauce loaded with herbs and just a hint of spice from a confetti of tiny chorizo bits. The Burgundy by the glass was top notch, and they have my favorite Republic of Tea bottled teas. Service was not French, but definitely charming and helpful, and everyone seemed glad for our business. This will definitely become a regular hangout for us.

I don't remember the names of any of them, but they were some of the best wines I have had recently. To start, we ordered the mussels, escargots, and beef tartare for the table (yes, I know very predictable for a french restaurant). They were all excellent, and the quantity was quite much larger than one might expect for a restaurant of this caliber and price scale. For our mains we ordered the Bouillabaisse (3x - everyone at the table who had it LOVED it), French Onion Soup (rich, flavorful, and oh so good), and the Pheasant special (tender and excellently spiced). We ended our meal with some celebratory absinthe.  The service was excellent, the food was great, the alcohol was better.

The bar was full and got a seat half an hour later. The bartender, an older man, took a good 10 minutes to notice us. I was trying to be patient/understanding seeing as how busy they were. He got us some bread but never got us water when I told him I was ready to order. I placed my order and later had them move us to a table, hoping the service would be a bit better. Nope, I was there for two hours, mainly because the food took forever to be served and the server checked on us once. I wasn't even sure who our server was. I had to flag down several servers a few times to get their attention.  Food: They offer $1 oysters on Friday nights as a bar special but by the time I got there, they were all out. For appetizers, I ordered the escargot and bone marrow. Escargot had an overwhelming amount of garlic and that was all I could taste. There was also A LOT of oil/butter. I thought my arteries were going to get clogged.The bone marrow was nothing special and didn't have any flavor. The bread that came with the bone marrow was burnt. The entree came out half an hour after my appetizers. For entree, I ordered the bouillabaisse. There wasn't a lot of flavor and the mussels and clams were so tiny, like 1/4 size of a dime. No, I am not exaggerating. I wish I could take a picture but the room was so dim. For dessert, I ordered a creme brûlée and a grand marnier soufflé. The soufflé was probably the best thing I had all night since it was very soft and fluffy. The creme brûlée was good but they burnt the hell out of the sugar and what was suppose to be a sweet dessert became a bitter one.  Overall: My bill turned out to be $83.  Service was 2/5  Food was 3/5 due to dessert.

It was described as codfish purée which did not sound appetizing to me but I gave it a try anyway and was very satisfied. Other great appetizers were the escargot and steak tartare, both authentically French.  For my entree I had the rabbit. It was nothing special and just a little dry. I was able to taste the bouillabaisse and the sweetbreads, both were excellent.  For dessert we had soufflés, chocolate with a creme anglaise and grand marnier with a raspberry sauce, again both were great, delicious with the right texture and served hot out of the oven.  The huge disappointment was the service. Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable but never asked if we wanted soufflés for dessert which take 45 minutes so you need to order it early on. On the positive side she made sure I was aware that the gratuity was already added.  The worst part of the service was the other service people were too quick to remove items from the table and neglected to ask if we were finished with those items. Then one of the back waiters or busman practically sat in my lap in an attempt to clear items from the other side of the table! So I thought is this a hint that they need to turn the table? It was not. It was 10:00 pm there were many other empty tables and only 2 people sitting at the bar.  Typically I blame poor service on the management due to improper or incomplete training.

He was on a first name basis with more than one of the patrons at the bar The house chips were very good. Not super crispy, but just the right amount of salt. I was a fan.  OYSTERS: I did three west coast and three east coast oysters.  The West coasts were from Hammersley Inlet in Washington state, but I was not given a name. The east coasts were Beausoleil's from New Brunswick. The Beausoleils were sweet and small, and chewy with a rounded and overall neutral taste. The  Hammersley Inlets were veryyy creamy and full, with soft, plentiful meat. They had a slight sweetness to them and were not fishy or oceanic at all. I loved them so much I ordered six more.  What surprised me most about these oysters is that they are not at all the kind of oysters to find their way into a dollar special, typically. But I can see that la Sardine has no qualms about serving excellent quality oysters, even during their dollar special.  ATMOSPHERE: Because this place is a bit more expensive, it seems to draw an older crowd, 40's and 50's. A lot of couples seemed to be on date night here. Everyone was very nice here, I had a good conversation with the guy sitting next to me, who suggested a few other places in the neighborhood to check out. And I had a polite conversation with the woman on the other side of me as well.  When I want good dollar oysters, I'll definitely be coming back here for Friday oyster specials.

To start, we ordered the foie gras with honey truffle butter, bone marrow, escargot, and gnocchi with oxtail. All were outstanding. The foie gras ""cream puffs"" were delicious, the bone marrow melted in your mouth, the escargot was perfectly executed in its classic bistro preparation, and that oxtail argue on the gnocchi was just spectacular. For my entree, I ordered the canard a l'orange, which was excellent. The duck was perfectly cooked medium rare and the sauce was delicious. Also on my table were a side of English peas and frites with garlic aioli. Both were good, although the frites were a tad on the soggy side. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate souffle and the fresh baked mini madeleines. I have to say, knowing that this place make souffle was one of the reasons I have been wanting to come so badly, and their chocolate souffle certainly did not disappoint. Other than I could have used just a little more chocolate flavor, it was perfection. The texture, the molten center, just excellent. In addition, the mini madeleines were served in the baking tray and were piping hot and fresh. Perfectly crisp on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside. I would definitely recommend at the very least taking a batch home, although nothing quite compares to a madeleine fresh out of the oven. Overall, I really enjoyed La Sardine and will certainly stop in when I'm craving a hearty French meal.

Entrees were delicious as well.  I selected the braised rabbit, large pieces of tender meat in a creamy dijon mustard sauce.  Others in my group had the duck l'orange which was outstanding, and the bouillabaisse.  We also tried their pommes frites which were a bit disappointing and the buttered English peas which were properly tasty and textural. This place is known for souffles and we tried the chocolate souffle which was was incredible.  Crusty and light, it is served right out of the oven with creme anglaise poured over the top.  The result is reminiscent of the best chocolate lava cake ever.  Delicious.  We also tried the made-to-order madeleines.  These cuties also arrived right out of the oven still in their mini-madeleine-pan.  Piping hot but so delicious and a perfect way to end a delicious meal. The wine list is big on value.  I think the most expensive bottle was around $150.  We had a very nice burgundy from Morey-Saint-Denis which was marked up 2x (what would we do without wine apps?).

Service was professional - and our server was happy to answer all the questions and the bus boys came in to the remove dirty plates quickly.  My pinot noir was perfect. My friend requested for the sweetest wine they had- and our server poured a tasting before fulfilling the glass entirely.  The menu has lots to chose from so definitely ask questions! I started with the french onion soup with gruyere cheese. It was perfect- warm and soothing broth with a generous amount of cheese and bread inside!

I spent a lot of time reading about different restaurants, and decided that French was the way I wanted to go. Then I had to find one that I could afford, but one that had gotten good reviews....in the end I chose La Sardine and I'm glad I did. First off - for those Oprah fans, it's right across the street from Harpo Studios - if that really means anything...it would have to my wife, but not to me. We started with a selection of cheeses and meats - my favorites were the grumpy goat cheese and duck galatine, wow both were excellent. The duck was especially tasty. The cheese was served as expected with almonds, apple slices, and honey - the meats with an excellent Dijon mustard. Both would have been better if served with crackers or thinly sliced bread. Two of us at the table had the French onion soup and it was to die for! The cheese was thick, flavorful, stringy, and toasted to a perfect golden brown. The broth had the right depth of flavor and was full of perfectly cooked onions. A must try! Since we had read so much about their seafood bouillabaisse, two of us tried it and it's everything they say it is. Full of all kinds of seafood with a broth that has a richness (probably from the saffron) that is excellent. One person had the Cassoulet Toulousain (basically a duck confit and a duck sausage) - outstanding, but a huge serving. Lastly, our vegetarian friend got the French version of gnocchi and although not a big eater, ate all of it and enjoyed every bite! So with all the food we ate (and a bottle of Pouilly-Fuisse) you ask - did you have room for dessert! Of course we did, when the dessert is their famous souffle....we got one chocolate souffle for the table (with four forks of course) and ate every bite - wow, it was delightful, light, not overly sweet, and very delicious. By the way, the service was outstanding, our waiter was knowledgeable, the overall wait staff was very competent and not obtrusive.

We visited this past winter,because they offer a chocolate souffle for dessert.  Technically that is true -- what they serve has the puffed up souffle appearance.  But unlike classic souffles, this one did not collapse when punctured -- it had none of the lightness of the real thing, which was sacrificed for the security of a sure thing.  Equally bad, then broke open the roof and dumped in the creme anglais rather than letting us add it as needed.  Our conclusion about the rest of the meal was, sadly, similar.  Not worth a return visit.",-0.6088,0.754,0.109,0.136,0.4292929292929293

I've never had beef tongue before but the way it was prepared here was similar to bacon (so obviously delicious!). For entrees, got ordered the Bouillabaisee and Rabbit Ragout. The bouillabaisee was full of great seafood and the broth was so good it was drinkable. The rabbit was perfectly cooked and fell off the bone!  Dessert - we got the caramel apple soufflé, which takes 30 minutes to prepare. It was ok but I probably wouldn't order it again  Altogether, most of the food was delicious.

We had a reservation and there WAS a table available for us when we arrived- right in front of the front door, sort of in the bar area, rather than in the main dining room. But it was my husband's birthday so it was a special night out, and being cold out (end of Feb) we didn't want the tiny table right in front of the door and right next to the hostess stand.  So we wound up taking a seat at the bar to wait for a table away from the front door and in the main dining area. After about a half hour our new table was ready.  The ambiance of the restaurant is nice. It's cozy and warm and felt very inviting. The crowd on a Saturday night seemed a little older- so we sort of felt like young'ins.  We got an order of pommes frites which was of course delicious! I ordered the bouillabaisse which was huge and stuffed full of delightful seafood. I loved it! The birthday boy got the rabbit pasta. There was SO MUCH meat in this dish! He almost couldn't finish it!  For dessert we ordered a chocolate soufflé, however the one they brought to our table definitely was not chocolate. We didn't bother mentioning it because we had to order the thing when we ordered our entrees because it takes so long for them to be made. We didn't have another 30 min to sit and wait for them to make a chocolate one. So that was a bummer because we were both really looking forward to that dessert.

2014-02-19,4.0,"My boyfriend and I went on a Tuesday night, which is the time to go since they offer a prix fixe menu for $27.50. You can pick any appetizer, entree, and dessert off the regular menu. For appetizers, we chose the Queue de Boeuf (braised oxtail with potato gnocchi) and the mussels. The oxtail is a standout here. The meat is tender and the sauce is just right. The mussels were good as well and were served in a light white wine cream sauce. For entrees, we had the Râble de Lapin (rabbit) and the duck. I was a bit nervous about the rabbit since I've never tried it before, but it turned out to be quite good and was nicely complemented by noodles and gravy. The duck was served with brussels sprouts and quinoa. It was good but didn't impress me as much as the rabbit. For dessert, we ordered a pear soufflé and a selection of cheeses. The pear soufflé was beautiful and had a nice subtle pear flavor. The cheese selection was also good, but at that point we were honestly so full that we couldn't eat it all.  Overall, the food was quite good. However, I was not as impressed by the service. Our waiter seemed frazzled and took a while to take our order. I was hoping that he might offer some suggestions as to what to order, but he didn't stay at our table long enough to answer questions. The fact that our waiter would only stay at our table for a minute or so also made it difficult for me to let him know that we were there for my boyfriend's birthday. I ended up telling the hostess. They put a candle on the soufflé, which was nice, but when I got the bill nothing was comped. I'd hoped that they would at least comp something-- a beer or the soufflé perhaps. They also didn't make much of a deal at all about it being his birthday. I wasn't expecting them to sing and dance, but they just presented the soufflé with the candle and maybe mumbled happy birthday. It's worth noting that this was my second time coming to this restaurant. On my previous visit, I did not have an issue with the service. The waitress on that occasion was helpful and spent time going over the menu. Another complaint, though minor, is that, although we had reservations, we were seated in a cramped location. Luckily, I am petite and was able to squeeze my way to my chair, but if I were any bigger, I don't think I would've been able to even get to my seat.

Had cassoulet for the entree.  The thing with cassoulet is that when it is prepared traditionally it takes hours and hours to make.  Restaurants of course cannot do that, so they must make some kind of compromise.  La Sardine's cassoulet came in an individual ceramic baking dish.  What I think they did was put sausage, duck confit, beans, and broth in the baking dish and then baked that for about 20 minutes.  The dish was good but lacked the rich, blended flavor from a cassoulet that has cooked for a really long time.  I'm not quite sure how a restaurant is supposed to achieve that effect, so perhaps it is my fault for ordering cassoulet at a restaurant.  I would be curious to learn how other restaurants handle cassoulet.  FYI there were a ton of beans in the cassoulet, easily two cans worth.  Not that there is anything wrong with that.  (I did eat them all).  Just saying.

The bone-in rib eye is listed as being for two, but easily fed three of us. They initially brought the entire roast and presented it. After slicing it they brought back to the table. along with some tiny sweet onions which were so tasty, they may have been my favorite part of the meal. They only prepare steaks one-way, medium-rare (which to me is absolutely perfect). It was a great dish. For dessert we had a pear soufflé. That combination was new to me and it was quickly gone. We also had a perfectly prepared, yummy crème brulee  We had a great Saint-Émilion red that I had heard about and that the waiter heartedly endorsed. It was delicious and reasonably priced.

I love me some garlicy buttery snails Brussel sprout side dish- I am a child about brussel sprouts, however these were actually so good that I ate half the dish, they weren't bitter at all yay! Cassoulet- the sausage white beans and broth were really delicious, however the ham and lamb were both super dry and hard to chew, i ended up picking around that Steak tartar-pretty good, I've definitely had better, but the portion size is pretty good. Service- Our waiter (I don't recall his name) was very nice, he was attentive offered good recommendations and didn't hurry us in the least. Bartender. yikes. he was a grump from the second we arrived, barely acknowledging us for the first 10 minutes we were trying to get a drink.  We decided to order a bottle of Champagne, so I pointed to the first Brut listed which was a $50 bottle, when the tab came, he charged us $85.  I got his attention and explained to him that we must have been charged for the wrong bottle, and then he got on his high horse saying that I requested a Brut, which I did. HOWEVER evidently on the menu there is on one ""TRUE"" Brut, whatever that means. I guess I'm not sophisticated enough to realize that even though 7 different bottles reference being a Brut, only one of them actually means it. WHATEVER.  The fascinating part is that even the one he pointed to and tried to charge us for was $75 so no matter how you slice it, the $85 charge isn't right.

2013-11-05,4.0,"La Sardine is a solid venue that does not seem to generate quite the buzz it deserves and seems to be overlooked. White linen tablecloths create an upscale impression though tables are packed fairly close together despite the largish space. The decor creates the ambiance of an authentic French Bistro; casually elegant this is a great place for a date night.  The menu here is wonderful; first time in a while a server had to make three trips to the table before we were ready order due to so many dishes sounding appealing. Tuesdays is definitely the night to come here; one of the best values I have seen in Chicago - for $27.50 you create your own three course meal and the entire menu is fair game, nothing excluded. Our primary server was jovial and attentive and helped narrow down our selections in a helpful manner. Beverage wise there was a moderate sized list of French wines (prices by the glass ranged from $9 to $13) as well as a mixture of classic and some modern cocktails ($12 a piece).  Most of the dinner was a success. My wife loved her hearty braised oxtail with potato gnocchi appetizer and I was quite pleased with my veal bone marrow served with fried onions, flavored salt and toasted bread. We also shared an extra appetizer of escargot that was nice as well. For entrees my wife opted for the steak tartare; while typically I see this listed as an appetizer the portion was generous (three quenelles) and a large side of delicious hand cut French fries was included. My entree was the bouillabaisse which was the only savory I would classify as fair; the broth was flavorful and there was chock-full of seafood, but sadly aside from the fish the rest of the seafood was bland and much of it rubbery and likely overcooked.  The kitchen had some pacing issues with desserts but our server made up for this by bringing out some complimentary sorbet as we waited. The wait ended up being worthwhile as my grand Grand Marnier souffle ended the meal on a high note; the presentation was impressive as the cake overflowed well over and beyond the perimeter of the ramekin. Taste wise it was light, airy and delicious. As a fan of macarons (and after having viewed a colorful array of these delicacies on the La Sardine website) I was hoping these would be brought as mignardises at the conclusion of the meal, but alas just the check was delivered. All in all a pleasant evening out and definitely a place I would consider returning.",0.9974,0.773,0.208,0.019,0.6115343915343915

First our server REFUSES to find out from the kitchen which dishes are safe for the food allergy at our table. It was before dining rush hour and we were one of two tables in the restaurant. He insisted we should tell him what we want and HE would tell us whether it has the food allergen. Every other restaurant I've been to has been extremely accommodating to this issue, so I don't understand their resistance here.  Fast forward to the bill, we were trying to figure out the proper amount to put on each of our cards, and in the process of writing that down on the check, making sure it's easy for them to charge each one. The hostess came over and ROLLED HER EYES and when we told her what we'd done, she just whips the check away like she was totally annoyed. Getting this attitude after dropping over $200 here was NOT pleasant at all. I gathered from the people waiting by the door that maybe someone was waiting for our table.

We got the escargot and lyonnaise salad as the appetizers and both were very good. The escargot was plump and tasty (of course slathered in butter) and the bacon/egg portion of the lyonnaise was delightful too. The croutons were no joke either. I have to say though, the lyonnaise salad at Maude's was better, but this was still good. For main dishes, we got the rabbit pasta and the seafood bouillabaisse, which I saw mentioned in a lot of reviews. the bouillabaisse was amazing. The broth was the right balance of fishy and saffron-y and the seafood was delicious. The rabbit was perfectly tender and a great balance with the egg noodle-like pasta and mushrooms.  But the real winners were dessert. I have never had souffle before and this place has ruined it for me. We got the chocolate and Grand Marnier souffle with raspberry sauce. Both were just incredible.

2013-03-13,1.0,"I headed to La Sardine with Ginger D. and Howie M. to celebrate Howie's birthday, which happened to fall on a Tuesday. This made La Sardine the perfect choice for us due to their Prix Fixed Menu, appetizer, entrée, and dessert for $27. A STEAL when you consider the fact that some of the entrees are $27 individually. Being a picky vegetarian there were not many options for me, however I must mention that the gorgonzola potatoes were absolutely delicious! I would go back just for the potatoes. Dessert is what sticks out regarding my experience at La Sardine. My white chocolate raspberry bread pudding was heavenly, and perfectly portioned for one if you are a ""dessert person"" and two if you just want a taste. I did sample the birthday boy's lavender ice cream.......big sigh, I love lavender ice cream when its done right and this was ""done right"". So smooth, so refreshing........ I would return to La Sardine just for dessert if not for the atrocious service we received. I know that wait staff are people, they have bad days, colds, rude customers etc. I also acknowledge that this was a busy night due to the Prix Fixed Menu, however there is no excuse for the behavior of our waitress Callie. She acted as if we were keeping her from something extremely important and we were bothering her with our silly questions about food and requests for items such as honey for tea (quick question- how can an establishment serve honey on a cheese platter but not have honey to serve with tea?).  Some specific examples of our horrid service include; upon explaining that it was Howie's birthday she did not bother to smile or say ""happy birthday"" (actually she did not smile at all- but she did send out a candle with his ice cream); when I asked her questions about some of the menu items she spoke to me as if I had an IQ of 50 because I was not familiar with French cooking styles; she never asked us how things were, poor Howie had his hands in the air like a school boy trying to get her attention to place requests; in response to a question Ginger D. had regarding post dinner coffee drinks she again began the ""I am talking to someone with an IQ of 50"" tone; after we received our café au lait (which was not made in the kitchen, she poured coffee and then handed us the tiniest side of warm milk I had ever seen) I took a sip and felt it was really too weak for my preferences. Ginger D felt the same way and when Callie came back, Ginger asked if she could please remove the coffee from the bill as we did not enjoy or drink it (both of our cups were full) and she received a blank stare. I piped in that the coffee was ""far too weak for my tastes, and I was sorry but could she remove it from the bill"", she did not say ""sorry"" or ""okay"" or ""I will see what I can do"" she said ""well have you had our coffee before?"" Ginger stated that she had eaten at the sister restaruant Bouchon previously and enjoyed their coffee, Callie replied ""well its the same."" That was not the point. The coffee at Bouchon is relevant to the taste and strength of the coffee we wished to enjoy at La Sardine THAT night.   At this point we felt so bad that Howie's bday dinner was being ruined I just stated ""No, this is my first time here, I prefer much stronger coffee, can you PLEASE remove this from the bill?"" and she replied ""fine"". Ginger D. stated that we were ready for the check and she said ""Good."". She then proceeded to drop the check on my tea pot and walk off in a huff. She did not ask if we needed anything else, she did not say thank you, she did not ask us to come again to La Sardine. I suppose our questions regarding the menu items, requests for condiments and coffee were just SO DEMANDING she was glad to be rid of us! For the record we did tip 20%, as I know that tips are often shared and the Hosts were very polite and helpful. I would not want the bus people or hosts to suffer because of one indignant server. If you happen to have a pleasant server I am sure La Sardine would be a ""go-to spot"" for french cuisine, however a bad taste has been left in my mouth. Sadly I will not be back to La Sardine despite the wonderful dessert given that I do not need to attend a restaurant or spend my hard earned money and feel as if I am a burden.

My co-worker is a bit on the stuffy side and was beyond pleased with the fact that there were some older patrons wearing jackets, and details like the cut of the potatoes in the bouillabasse. Personally, I liked that there were also casually-dressed younger folks, and that the food tasted great. The staff was knowledgable, yet warm and quick to give recommendations when asked. I was so stuffed by the end of the meal that I couldn't finish my apple tart. My bow-tied co-worker gleefully finished it while marveling over the lovely cut of the apples.

So we ventured there early on a Sat night and the place was empty.  OK, more space and food for US!  Service was polished and prompt.  Ordered drinks, Lyonnaise salad and Escargot.  Escargot was fabulous, lots of garlic and butter.  How can anybody get this wrong?  Maybe the Canadians do but I wouldn't know...Salad was nice too with plenty of lardons.    Ordered the Dover Sole for 2, which sounded fantastic.  About 15 minutes later, an anonymous woman (cook? runner? streetwalker?  I have no idea) brought out the entire portion of the fish and I thought, wow, we get all that food!  A few minutes later, a much smaller plated portion was brought to us.  A bit disappointed at the size, but the flavor was on the mark; warm, buttery, and slightly fishy like it should be.  Melted in your mouth.  Green beans were a bit undercooked but the sauce and butter made up for it.  Split the apple tart which was extremely satisfying.  Left extremely impressed.  What a nice bistro!  Can't wait to go back and then I heard that I can get the same meal for $25 on Tuesday.  What a deal!",0.9751,0.782,0.143,0.074,0.5008680555555556

2011-05-29,4.0,"TRUE STORY (If you don't care, skip to ""ONTO MY REVIEW!""): It was my 10th birthday, and my mom decided to bring me a surprise lunch to school. Anticipating the event, I told my friends it was going to be something amazing. When she showed up, I saw the aluminum-foil wrapped styrofoam container and I yelped with excitement. ""What is it? What is it?"" my friends asked. ""It's FROG LEGS!!!!,"" I exclaimed.  Not surprisingly, most 5th graders in a Northwest Indiana parochial school found this to be disgusting, if not perverse--and they watched in horror as I nibbled each tiny little leg, garlic butter dripping from my chin.  I had no shame then, and I don't now. ONTO MY REVIEW! On our most recent visit to La Sardine, bone marrow was one of the specials, so when my husband suggested we give it a try, I said, ""sign me up!"" We also partook in the secret foie gras appetizer, which is always available, but never on the menu. We discussed the sweetbreads as well, but decided against for this visit. I can't remember why.  Food: Always good. I never pass up the chance to have the Lyonnaise salad and my husband absolutely loves the onion soup--both excellent starters. The mains are consistently good--pretty traditional French fare. Rabbit or duck--can't go wrong. And, although I'm not a streak person, I believe my husband when he says they're usually very good. Get the chocolate souffle, but order it early--it takes 45 minutes to make. Price: The secret foie gras seems a bit pricey at $20, but it's worth it and the price tag never deters us. Salad prices are a bit steep, but again, they are quite good. Main course prices are pretty standard. There aren't many affordable options on the wine list--and who wants to eat good French food without a great wine pairing--so this really adds to the overall bill. I don't think we've ever walked out of there (with the exception of the Tuesday $25 prix fixe deal) without a bill less than $200. Atmosphere: Cozy French feel--makes for a nice romantic night or a fun dinner with friends. Service: The servers must love their jobs. We've been going there for several years now and we still see the same friendly faces waiting on us. Attentive and helpful!

Tonight we had some great wine at the Tasting Room on Randolph and were passing by La Sardine on the way home, we then remebered we have been wanting to try it!  We saddled up to the bar since we had already been drinking we felt like that was where we belong.  The baretender, Alexa, was very personable, made us feel welcome and made me want to be her friend!  She was great!  And now I always want to eat at the bar there!   We had, some French Pinot and a Bourdeux, we loved both...again, we had already been drinking wine though.  Starters:  Escargot.  I am a little picky with my escargot and have to admit first taste of this I was thinking too much parsley, then I dipped some bread and had another and I was hooked!  It was great!  The parsley was actually a great balance to the garlic/oil.  It was in my top 3 of escargot (and I have tried many).

2011-01-31,4.0,"I couldn't say if this is authentic French bistros food. I still love what I had in Paris. La Sardine is worth to try if you are free on Tuesday night for the Prix Fixe. We had been going there on and off for more than 5 years. I wish we could go more often but we are 30+ miles away from downtown. Initially, the Prix Fixe was $20. It's now $25 and still worths every penny. As you may know, it is only offered on Tuesday night. Prepare to wait even if you have a reservation. The place is usually packed on Tuesday night. You may also know that the Prix Fixe let you order any appetizer or salad, entree and dessert. It is a steal for $25. For appetizer, I highly recommend the La Queue De Boeuf. The oxtail was first braised and the meal was stripped off the bone and stew with potato. I have eaten better pate elsewhere but it's not bad here. The highlight of the escargots isn't the snails but it's the garlic butter sauce. I usually end up eating too much bread if I order it. For entree, avoid the steaks. If you want to eat steak, go to Chop House or anyone of those steak house in River North. Lamb Shank is one of the best entree there, the portion is good, meat is tender and sauce tastes wonderful. I also like the Bouillabaisse, the beef Bourguignon and the duck breast. Once a while, they will offer cassoulet. My wife doesn't care about it too much but I like to each the beans. Another thing to avoid is the rabbit. Rabbit meat is so lean that is very hard to make it juicy. For dessert, you have to order the souffle.

2011-01-01,2.0,"I should preface this review by mentioning that it concerns a meal we had at La Sardine on New Year's Eve, so perhaps our less than satisfactory experience was due to the evening in question. However, as neighborhood residents who've been to this bistro many times, our most recent dining experience there was subpar. We had reservations for 8 pm and when we arrived our table wasn't quite ready, but we ordered cocktails at the bar and were escorted to our seats within just a few minutes. The bartender, hosts and server were all very accommodating (although our server was not very attentive, perhaps due to the number of tables she was handling) -- my complaint is with the quality and value of the food we were served, which was not what we had come to expect from La Sardine. We started with a tomato tart appetizer that arrived lukewarm and was fairly tasteless. For entrees, my dining companion ordered (from the special NYE menu) a filet and I ordered the lobster thermidor -- and it was here that the dinner went downhill. The filet, ordered rare to medium rare, arrived medium and was clearly overcooked.  After getting our server's attention to request a filet cooked to the requested temperature, she returned within about 3 minutes with another steak that, while rare, was lukewarm at best and plated with two overcooked pieces of asparagus. For $30, this was a very small (perhaps 4 oz?) piece of meat and a lackluster presentation. The lobster thermador was even more disappointing. The dish was also lukewarm and was such a meager portion -- the crustacean was split lengthwise and was so tiny that it looked like a large crawfish rather than a lobster -- that I was able to dig out maybe 6 or 7 bites total. In addition, there was virtually no trace of the sauce or seasoning one would expect in a dish labeled ""thermidor."" This appetizer-sized portion was $32. We finished with the featured raspberry souffle, which was decent, and after coffee, paid our bill and left.  All I can say is that I hope this was an anamoly as we've dined at La Sardine many times before and had much better meals -- this one was a very poor value and we left feeling hungry and, frankly, ripped off.",0.9536,0.872,0.086,0.041,0.5040741121623474
2010-11-10,3.0,"Initially three of us had plans to dine at ""Hot on Yelp"" Davanti Enoteca, but one of our party had to bow out due to car trouble, so two of us ended up here instead.  We both love French food and I hadn't been here in over a year so we were both looking forward to it.  La Sardine has been around for years, so I was a little surprised at how busy it was on a Tuesday night. Maybe that's due in part to the special prix-fixe menu offered, but either way, it's a good thing we had a reservation.  This place is charming. Lots of wood, exposed brick and a sea theme going on. The tables are somewhat close together and it was also very hot in there, perhaps because it was unseasonably warm weather, but I am never too hot, and I was schvitzing in my sweater.  As I mentioned, it was Prix-Fixe Tuesday, so for $25, you got your choice of appetizer or soup, entree and dessert, which is a pretty good deal, especially since the entire menu (including specials) was fair game.  I started with a glass of Bordeaux, which is my favorite French wine, and my friend and I both ordered the French onion soup, roasted chicken, and for dessert, the chocolate souffle.  The onion soup was good, certainly not the best I've had, but not the worst either. It lacked a deep, rich flavor and the cheese was a little bland.  The chicken was somewhat flattened and de-boned, and served over a potato puree with a melange of julienned vegetables. The chicken was tasty, but the vegetables (zucchini, carrots and yellow squash) added nothing to the dish. I wish it would have been served with haricots verts. I am such a sucker for skinny green beans.  After we finished our main courses, we were served the chocolate souffles. They make a show of presenting it by cutting open the top and pouring in the creme anglaise. I'd rather have gotten to do it myself. The souffle was light and airy, but it could have been a little more chocolaty.  Service was perfunctory; not warm and enthusiastic, but certainly not brusque either. Unfortunately though, he did forget to bring my friend's leftovers.  I liked La Sardine, but I wasn't wowed. There are certainly better French restaurants in the city and most definitely there are worse ones. The prix-fixe is a good deal; if I go back I would go back on a night this is offered.

We then transferred to our table where I was eagerly awaiting the special of the night - rack of lamb - and it did not disappoint.  Two double cut rib chops, perfectly and juicily cooked rare.  I took one home and I think it will be a delightful midnight snack tonight.  The other special of the night was mustard pig's feet - a super-savory cross between a meat loaf and hash topped off with an explosive jus with red wine, champagne, and savory notes.  Here's hoping that creation is added to the regular menu.",0.9954,0.703,0.284,0.013,0.4952811893988365

2010-08-29,4.0,"If I could give 4.5 I would. We came on a Wednesday, and it was not very full, but we also went at 5:30 because two people in my party were coming straight from a matinee downtown.  The food was really, really good and the service was excellent - attentive but not hovering. We did have a problem with our orders.  The kitchen had a mix-up, so the waiter informed us my brother-in-law's food would be another 5 or 10 minutes.  They were extremely apologetic, and offered my brother-in-law an appetizer on the house in the meantime.  He declined, because we had already had appetizers, but they brought him a few orders of frites on the house while he waited.  They also gave him a complimentary glass of wine and later comped one of our souffles and brought a trio of sorbets on the house.  Obviously the mix-up is annoying, especially when the restaurant couldn't have had more than 15 orders at the time, but the point is that they went above and beyond to fix it.   Here's a breakdown: Escargots - very tasty.  Of course, anything drenched in garlic butter is very tasty. Charcuterie plate - not the best I've had, but solid.  Country pate and duck rillettes were very good, although could have used a bit more seasoning.  Peppered salami was great (although I'm pretty sure it wasn't house-made, which is totally fine, just a note).  The small beet salad that accompanies it was delicious.  (We had 5 people, so I only got a few bites...darn.)  Cornichons, as always, were a much-needed acidic brightness to balance the richness and fattiness of the meats. Braised oxtail with gnocchi - OMG I have dreams about this dish.  Perfectly cooked oxtail, velvety and rich sauce.  Delicious!  The gnocchi are not really gnocchi - they're more like large, soft dumplings, but they complement the texture well.  I would eat this every day if I could. Roasted rabbit with mushrooms over pasta - Excellent!  The rabbit was tender and very flavorful, and had just enough gaminess to be satisfying.  I will say that the pasta seems odd at a French restaurant, but who cares, because it went very well with the dish.   Chocolate souffle with creme anglaise - very good.  Maybe not the best ever, but how good does chocolate souffle really have to be?  It's very light and airy, and not too sweet.  The creme anglaise is perfect.  (Other places make it so thin that it doesn't stick to anything - La Sardine's is just substantial enough, not too thick.) Grand Marnier souffle with strawberry coulis - tastes good, but the coulis overpowers the taste of the souffle.  It's good and I liked it, but it's really more about the novelty of the souffle.  I think there are better desserts on the menu. Peach melba - delicious.  Peaches are in season right now, so they were soooo good.  The raspberry sauce and almond topping were a perfect complement to the beautiful peaches.    Sorbets - lemon, mango, and cassis.  All house-made and delicious.  The cassis was my favorite, but the 3 flavors went really well together.   My dining partners had the lamb shank (2), the bouillabaisse, and the steak au poivre special, and they were all very, very happy.   All in all, we were extremely happy with our dinner.  Was it perfect beginning to end?  No.  But, it was one of the best meals I've had this year.",0.9994,0.691,0.26,0.049,0.614828890245557

Alright, so I guess I'm not the best judge of French food and that's why I wasn't overly impressed with the menu. The best deal on this menu is the $27.50 three course deal.  I ordered the salad with supposedly amazing croutons, the steak and fries and the chocolate dessert option.  The best thing on the steak was the garlic butter.  Very tasty and great with the steak.   I don't know if I was just agitated due to a late dinner, but I felt like service mirrored that of Europe.  (Authentic, I suppose.)  It took our waiter like 80 years to give us our bill and run our credit cards.  Meh.   But, the reason I want to request a refund is that all of us, all 5 of us, each felt ill after the dinner.  Actually, one friend felt sick even before we left the restaurant.  Like, wtf did they put in the food to cause all of us to get sick?  Perhaps this is oversharing, but I had some serious stomach cramps going on for a good 2 hours.  Thank God for tums, yo.   That's all I can say.

I had a nice glass of sancerre to start - sancerre is great for a hot day.  Then I had their house salad, which had a *perfect* dressing and a nice assortment of greens and tomatoes.  I have one small ""observation"" about the salad, though - the tomato in the salad was obviously refrigerated after it had been diced.  This isn't a huge deal, but details do matter, and tomatoes do lose something when they're refrigerated after being cut.  It's a misstep, but not enough for me to dock them a star. For the main course I had their special beef tenderloin, which came with watercress and pomme frites.  And the best bearnaise sauce I've had since the first time I had it in Paris.  So many places make some thick, heavy goopy sauce and call it bearnaise, but this was the real deal, light, full of flavor, and not heavy at all.  This is the way the sauce that made me fall in love with it should be made.  The meat was cooked perfectly to order, perfectly seasoned, and the watercress was lightly dressed and nice and fresh.

We came for a 7pm reservation and the place is packed.  We had to wait about 10 minutes for our table but we sat at the bar and my husband ordered a drink.  Once we were seated, bread was delivered.  I could make a meal out of their bread.  Their baguette and I believe oatmeal loaf was amazing!  I found out that their bread is from Red Hen Bakery and have been going there for my fixes! I got the escargot, braised lamb shank and their souffle.  I love escargot and if it's on the menu, I'll order it.  These were too salty for my taste.  I like salt and it definitely helps add flavor but this was over the edge.  It was hard to eat the last two.  No biggie.  It didn't ruin the entire meal.  The braised lamb shank was heavenly.  The meat fell off the bone and I don't think I used my knife once.  A few carrots and other veggies accompanied the meat but it was a small portion that they almost could have done with out it.  I didn't finish the lamb shank and took it home.  It made a great meal the next day and in the privacy of my home, I was able to get the marrow out using a chopstick.  YUM.  The souffle I got was huge and I only ate a little of it.  So much food.  They did make us order dessert when we gave our appetizer and entree selections.  I guess with the souffles, they take a while.   The hubby got the grilled blood sausage (his favorite part of the meal), bouillabaisse (he still claims Cafe Bernard is the best) and the apple tart.  He enjoyed his meal but probably not as much as me. Overall, the place was good.  It does get loud and busy on Tuesdays but I can understand why everyone wants to go that night.  It's a steal for getting a three course meal with selecting anything off the dinner menu.  I have only gone this one time but am looking forward to going back.  I hear at lunch they have a prix fixe menu but only a couple dollars cheaper.  With it being so close to work, maybe a long lunch at La Sardine is coming up in the near future.",0.9943,0.853,0.127,0.02,0.4908854166666667

The server genuinly seemed to be trying but she was quite overworked.  After being seated, we got very little attention.   After a quick stop by for our food order (when we had still not ordered drinks or wine), our entrees was delivered timley by someone other than our server, who dropped off the food and disappeared.  Now ""how is everything"", no ""can I get you anything else?"" we were treated like an inconvienance.  The food was average French bisto, nothing stand out at all about it. When the server finally returned, we had to beg for dessert, and then forgetting about coffee, we gave up, not expecting to see her again. . . needless to say we won't be returning.",-0.3291,0.905,0.039,0.056,0.503125
2008-03-21,3.0,"3.5 stars. Most points docked off for service and price. The waitress seemed friendly but made some subtly rude comments and while the food came fast, the service for getting orders, getting the check, etc was very slow. For a place with such steep prices, I'd expect a lot more than getting dumped with a bunch of ice onto my place setting during water refills. She also obviously did not know the menu nor food very well because she responded only with enthusiastic ""it's GREAT! it's AWESOME"" Um...that tells me nothing about the food!  We came for a birthday celebration and upon hearing that they charge $6/slice for cake we already PAID for, we had to find somewhere else to sing and eat cake. Major turnoff.  now on to the FOOD! (since we just came here tonight, this is fresh from my memory so as a stream of consciousness, I'll write as much as I can remember from all my friends' dishes and their thoughts) Complimentary bread: 2 different kinds, I liked the baguette one. Too bad it wasn't toasted and warm. But hey, nothing that butter can't fix.  Escargot: topped with pesto and while fragrant, is not as good as the usual garlic and butter topping found in most French restaurants. Mussels: savory white wine sauce a little light on flavor and  the quality/freshness of mussels was only so-so.  Roasted duck leg and duck sausage with zucchini: DELICIOUS. SO glad I ordered this! Duck was tasty and tender, could easily separate meat from the bone and came with mashed potatoes--yum. I thought the duck leg was better than duck sausage. Plenty of veggies with it, too.  Veal sweetbread (thymus/pancreas): well cooked and tender but as expected with this kind of meat, very gamey. The fried parmesan macaroni fritters (sorry, forgot its name) was interesting. Besides a burnt taste, it didn't have much flavor to it.  Grilled steak: most of my friends seemed to really enjoy their steak and the pommes frites it came with was especially satisfying hot and fresh out of the fryer Halibut special: No flavor in the fish but the sauce and risotto that complemented had a lot of flavor to go with it.  Grilled chicken: dry and not very flavorful SOUFFLE: Ok, some minor parts were burnt as my friend pointed out but this was sooo light and fluffy, moist, and well portioned. It came with strawberry sauce on the side but I think it tasted better without. I'd just come for the souffle!",0.9969,0.762,0.181,0.057,0.5809703504043127

For an appetizer, I had the mussels, which are served in a white wine, cream and herb sauce.  They were so delicious!  In fact, the sauce was so good I sopped it up with like six pieces of bread. However, I still had room for my duck leg and duck sausage, on mashed potatoes with courgettes (I don't know why I didn't just say zucchini there, but I know the french word for zucchini so maybe I'm just showing off).  This was also delicious, in fact I can't tell if I liked the duck leg or the sausage better.  Hmmm, decisions, decisions.

Anyway, funny story aside... great place.  The wines I had both nights were fantastic, the escargot was not served too hot (one of my pet peeves), and everything is delicious and how you expect it at a classic French Bistro. My first waiter last night was problematic, he was insistent on me ordering my dessert at the beginning of the meal (I'm sure because souffle takes forever to bake which I can appreciate).  I told him that I wasn't sure, but I knew I didn't want souffle, well that wasn't enough... and he could tell that I felt pressured and a bit faklempt but still insisted on the order to ""ease the flow of the dinner service"" whatever.  Anyway, I asked a specific question about the wine list and then adopted a new waiter.

The food was phenomenal.  The table bread was so delicious, we had to make them take it away or risk eating the whole basketful.  Oxtail and escargot for starters, and my mouth is watering just thinking about them.  I got the beef bourguignon, which was equally tasty, and my fiance got the leg of lamb which was huge and was off-the-bone tender.  Creme brulee for dessert; mmmmm.

2007-09-20,5.0,"Tres Bon!  I went to La Sardine for dinner last night and I think I might have just found my new favorite French restaurant! From the time I walked in the front door- I was transported to a small bistro in Paris (it's just that the people were nicer and I didn't need to use my college French!)  Taking a seat at the bar, I ordered a drink and took a look around.  There are whimsical murals painted around and cafe curtains on the windows.  The wine list is great- and if you come on a Monday- all the wines are half price. We had our choice of tables and sat by the window.  Perfect.  I made the mistake of trying a piece of bread out of the bread basket - fresh and chewy and it was so good it was impossible to stop eating it.  For our appetizers we split the gnocchi with oxtail (this was amazing) escargot (very good) and some special lobster and goat cheese mixture which was a combination of fascinating flavors and textures. As for our entree's, we went with the sweetbreads, the halibut and the braised lamb shank (a friend of mine swears by braising and I have him to thank for the most tender lamb I've ever had!)  All were delicious and the portion sizes were enough for two meals.  About mid dinner, we ordered a souffle with creme sauce for dessert which was decadently wonderful and perfectly timed!!  I wish I could bottle the smell! The service was impeccable (they must work on a team basis as there were at least 3 people fawning over us) and the atmosphere comfortable.

2007-09-14,4.0,"Solid French place across the street from the ominous Harpo Studios complex.  I was led to belive that La Sardine would be snooty & expensive, but the dining room is comfortable & not overwhelmingly elegant, and all the regular dinner entrees were priced under $20 each. They have daily specials which can be more pricey, I tried a tenderloin with gorgonzola cheese & frites special which was well worth the extra $$.  The frites were mildly crispy & melted in the mouth, just like frites should.  From the regular menu we tried the lamb shank, served in a huge portion & very tender.  A highly recommended appetizer is the Blood Sausage, I've sampled plenty of good and bad blood sausage over the years, and this was probably the best blood sausage I've tried in recent memory. La Sardine is affiliated with Le Bouchon, and I chose to visit Sardine over Bouchon because La Sardine offered souffles for dessert.  Service was a bit bumpy on the night we visited, so they gave us for free both the Grand Marnier and Chocolate souffles!  Both were delicious, though I had to essentially wolf down both desserts myself as my dining companion was on a diet.  I can still taste both souffles this morning (burp!)

2007-09-14,5.0,"SOLID BISTROT EXPERIENCE Let me start first off by saying that I'm pretty picky when it comes to French food served in the U.S.  Living in France as an expat for two years will do that for you. Every now and then I get a hankering for some solid, cafe classics and I need to go take care of that.  Today was such a day and La Sardine did just that. AMBIANCE:  The place doesn't scream France or Paris.  It screams industrial U.S.  However, the owners have done their best to soften it by painting everything and adorning the tables with crisp, white tablecloths.  They might think about changing the music selection, though.  Deonne Warwick's ""Do You Know the Way to San Jose"" (wo wo wo wo, etc.) just doesn't take me back to France no matter how good the food and service are. SERVICE:  Very solid.  Servers are francophones or know enough French to understand the whole menu in French.  On the whole they were very attentive, friendly, not obtrusive and gave great recommendations. PRICE:  I went for the 3-course prix-fixe lunch (appetizer, entree and desert).  At $22 this is very reasonable indeed even when you add wine and coffee to round out the experience. FOOD:  The food is the real star here.  Most of my meal was very similar to or as close as you can get here in the U.S. to what was served to me in France. Appetizer:  I started with the pate and saussicion.  The latter was pepper-encrusted and most excellent.  The former was what I would call 'safe' and not truly representative of a real 'pate de compagne'. Entree:  I went for the classic steak frites.  Best I've ever had outside of France.  Hands down.  The frites were truly and really that and not some adaptation of American 'freedom fries'.  Doneness and seasoning were impecable.  Same could be said for the steak. Dessert:  I had an apple tart that wasn't a true 'tarte tatin' but very good served atop caramel (handmade, I'm sure) and with a dollop of caramel ice cream. Wine / Cofee:  Both very good.  $9 Cotes-du-Rhone was an excellent value for the price paid.  Espresso with desert was most classic and appropriate. FINAL RECOMMENDATION:  If you're in the area for lunch, I highly recommend La Sardine.",0.9894,0.857,0.123,0.02,0.41179398148148155

2007-08-20,4.0,"A Brief Aside This is my first Yelp review since having moved back from NYC. ::::the author weeps tears of blood:::: The hardest part about leaving--friends and inconvenience aside--was leaving the food. Eating, appreciating and/or condemning food is more than simply an obsession, it's an art: like throwing a wicked curveball, or recovering an onside kick. Manhattanites, in particular, seem to have perfected this art.  But after tonight, I'd be willing to bet that places like La Sardine show that Chicagoans are following suit--and not for ""Second City-zen"" status, either. Let those ignorant Yankees and so-called Mets ""fans"" take note: there are smaller market franchises making better food with half the pretension. And, indeed, half the price.    The Review Proper I noticed quite a few foodies around me, ooh-ing and ooh-la-la-ing at the suitably comfy digs at La Sardine. I had my drink at the bar, thrilled to be showing off my city to a New York friend, and all on ""half-price wine night"" (every Monday). Once handed the wine list, I knew it was--as the kiddies are saying--""on"": four first growth Bordeauxs, a shit-ton of respectable (even reasonable) Burgundies, and the prospect of drinking it all 50% off. Priceless. Being seated, my buddy and I gasped lovingly at some of the traditional items offered: sauteed sweetbreads...braised kidneys...and mon dieux!, boudin noir. For the many who've not been lucky enough to get to France, boudin noir is artisanally-crafted blood sausage--and despite how many rare steaks my fellow Chicagoans have had, trust me: blood has never tasted so good. Perhaps next time, Steve and I agreed--there was so much else to be gobbled, and so little time. To borrow a metaphor, we ordered for the fences: he had the escargot bourguignon (perfectly braised in butter and garlic); I had the lobster & morel gratin (claw meat and deliciously woodsy morels in a rich dill cream sauce). He ordered the steak frites (with maitre d'hotel butter and a crapload of crispy fries); I ordered the venison tenderloin (PERFECT, with black peppercorns, roasted asparagus, celeriac puree and a loverly-reduced au jus). We finished the meal by splitting a Grand Marnier souffle, topped with raspberry sauce--a perfect complement to the red Hermitage we were slurping down (for half-price...I felt like a thief).      An Epilogue, and a Hope There are a few minor reasons La Sardine doesn't get five stars from me: first, though the menu is artfully crafted, it could benefit from a few more selections--everything is in large type and confined to two pages, leaving little wiggle room for those unsure of what they want; second, the quality of the food cries out for a nightly tasting menu, rather than the Tuesday-night $25 prix-fixe they have presently (with absurdly long waits, I hear); third, and most important, a place as traditionally-grounded as this should tell the enforcers of the foie gras ban, in as many words, to fuck off. Feature the foie prominently--lord knows I'd trust this chef with MY liver, let alone a duck's. So fowl and fair a thought I've not seen. There! I said it!

2007-04-25,4.0,"My gf and I had dinner with a couple of friends last night at La Sardine.  As other Yelpers have already noted, La Sardine offers a prix-fix menu on Tuesdays: $25 for any appetizer, entree and dessert (used to be $22, I believe -- damn inflation).  Given our past experiences with restaurants offering prix-fix menus, we thought there was a good chance that the place would be packed so we made 7 pm reservations just to be on the safe side.  When we got there, the place was indeed very full, with every table occupied and plenty of people waiting by the bar.  Whew -- good thing we made reservations!    One problem: our table wasn't ready yet.  The hostess told us it'd be a few minutes before our table would be ready.  Ok, no biggie.  15 minutes went by -- still no table.  We asked the hostess again when our table was going to be ready and she said it'd be another 15 minutes.  After the next 15 minutes passed, still no table.  When we inquired one more time, the hostess told us that we may need to wait a little while longer.  How much longer?  Probably another 15 minutes.  Not cool.  But before we had a chance to get huffy, the hostess offered to buy us a round of drinks, which we happily accepted.  I won't say the free booze made everything ok, but it definitely helped the last 15 minutes go by a little more quickly.. In any case, we finally got seated at around 8 pm, a good hour after our 7 pm reservations.  As for the food, everything was pretty good.  I started with the pate, which was sizable and quite tasty.  For my entree, I had the braised lamb shank.  The meat was tender but not quite in the fall-off-the-bone kind of way that I was hoping for.  Flavor-wise though -- no complaints.  For dessert, I ordered the Grand Marnier souffle.  Best part of the meal hands down.  I also tried some of everyone else's desserts (the chocolate souffle, the molten chocolate cake and the white chocolate & raspberry bread pudding) and they were all delicious.  Great way to finish the meal.  Service was also top notch throughout our meal.  Only minor gripe would be the noise level, as it was difficult at times to hold a conversation at my table.

Its also one of the few French places that isn't lazy and still takes the time to make a good, traditional souffle....  You need to order it way ahead of desert time (they should ask you mid-meal or prior usually).  Definetly try the chocolate souffle (the grand marnier one isn't my favorite...), since its one of the only places in Chicago to get it. ..They have some great specials.  Monday night is half price wine night.  Their wine is already reasonably priced, so its possible to get a really great bottle of wine for the same as you'd pay retail.  You're getting an even better deal on the more expensive wines. Thursday they have a prix-fixe menu. My only real complaint about this place is their menu seems to never ever change.  Its a pretty traditional, somewhat limited menu.  Though there are some very good things on it. My other half tried the sweet breads and found them to be dry and awful, too. Everything else seems reliable, though. The place is always packed, but usually even in peak times you can just walk in and get a table for 2 quickly.",0.9202,0.865,0.105,0.03,0.5729148629148628
2006-11-13,3.0,"I went with two friends at 8pm on a Saturday night - prime dining time.  The place was packed, and had a warm, cozy feel to it.  The wait staff was very friendly.  Service was good.  Although I'd love to gush about the place, I have to admit, the food just wasn't great.  I got the grilled steak, and it was a bit on the tough side.  One of my friends got the hangar steak, and it, too, was a bit tough...  I might go back simply because I loved the atmosphere, but overall, I'd have to give them only 3 stars.....",0.8689,0.805,0.161,0.034,0.5979853479853479

2006-09-20,4.0,"La Sardine has everything it takes to set the mood- nice ambiance w/ dim- lighting (but bright enough to see the person you're with) :) They have excellent food- the salmon is a must. GREAT desserts- creme brulee and vanilla or chocolate souffle. YUMMY! Plus they have an awesome wine list, so if you're feeling ""love in the air"" you should check this place out. The service can be comme ci comme ca, but other than that ...GO!",0.9501,0.766,0.234,0.0,0.7525
2006-09-08,5.0,"I love this French restaurant. It has a great location in the West Loop, making it a great date place. The wine selection is wonderful, and the food is very very good. I had the best salad of my life here. That may be a bit of an overstatement, but I like to exaggerate. I've heard the deal nights are worth it. Our waiter had a French accent, which made the evening that much more enjoyable.",0.9653,0.673,0.287,0.04,0.4890909090909091
2006-07-19,5.0,"My favorite Chicago Bistro.  The Mon & Tues deals can't be beat.  Service has been very good.  Food is great!  But it is a Bistro- don't come expecting high end, formal French dining.  Do come expecting tasty, authentic French food and wine in a nice, but less formal setting.  It's Le Bouchon's cousin, but doesn't feel nearly as cramped to me, the drive is worth it for the better setting.",0.903,0.812,0.188,0.0,0.4905555555555556
2006-07-08,4.0,"I have been to La Sardine a few times and have had a very good experience each time. This is bistro style French and they do a very nice job. My favorite and recommendation here is the Bouillabaisse, which is a seafood filled soupy dish. The flavor is amazing and nice to dip french bread/butter. But I have also had other dishes here and they were also good. Word is that on Tuesdays they have a deal on Average entree is about $14-$25. Prefix menu for $22 where you get an appetizer, main course of your selection and a dessert. Staff is casual, helpful and not snooty. Definitely worth trying if you like french food.

2006-03-24,4.0,"The food here was excellent, (and you pay for it).  I had the hangar streak (amazing) and creme brulee (solid.)  However, I found the ambience a bit underwhelming and casual for dinner time, since we were paying so much.  (I was on a date and felt overdressed.)  I bet it's fantastic for lunch though.",0.8271,0.811,0.164,0.025,0.6611111111111111
