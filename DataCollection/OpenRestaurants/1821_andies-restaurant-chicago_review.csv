2017-08-06,2.0,"Food is decent tasting but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way for it. The restaurant's atmosphere is adequately nice. We visited on a Sunday night, and the restaurant was not busy, but we still waited nearly an hour for our main courses, and when they finally came out, one was wrong...our server even admitted she entered it wrong! After waiting that long for what was an incorrect order, I would have expected a bit more than a cold apology and a measly $4 discount. Thy also gave us a couple coupons for the next visit (with the purchase of two entrees, of course). At that point, the coupons were a slap in the face and certainly not the way to get repeat customers. There are much better and more reasonably priced options for this type of food in Chicago. Needless to say, we left the coupons on the table, because we'll not be back.",0.9199,0.857,0.118,0.025,0.5480725623582766

We ordered feta & olives as an appetizer which was ok, I mean you can't really go wrong with that. However our meal was subpar at best. I ordered the sautéed spinach with garbanzo beans. From the description I was expecting something amazing but what I received was room temperature dill rice topped with something that resembled creamed spinach with about 6 garbanzo beans on the entire plate. My friends ordered the crab cake salad and the other had curry vegetables with couscous (which she loved, maybe I should've ordered what she had).

I didn't want to make a fuss, since I was nearly done with my drink before I discovered it. The Mojito itself tasted a bit watery.  Second, my friend was served the wrong soup that was ordered.  Third, our entrees' sides were mixed up. My Filet Mignon Kabob was served over basmati rice instead of potatoes (as ordered), and the other entree was over potatoes instead of rice... We wish the food would've made up for this mistake but the Trio Kabob was quite bland. The basmati rice tasted like microwaved store-bought rice in a box.

I didn't enjoy it very much, so I ended up not being able to enjoy my baba ganoush to the fullest extent. The lemon chicken soup was pretty average. I liked the portobello and lentil dish over basmati rice. It was pretty good but nothing to write home about. I enjoyed the peanut butter brownie because it came out warm and it just melted in my mouth.  Overall, I thought it was a bit too expensive for a meal that was pretty average.

2017-03-04,3.0,"After encountering a wait at a nearby establishment for Saturday brunch and time on the parking meter, we decided to give Andies a try. The mostly empty restaurant should have been an indication. The fireplace was nice and the waitress was attentive. She did go out for a smoke break but only had one other table. The service did not suffer since we had just placed our order. Our water was constantly refilled.  As for the food, the complimentary warm Pita bread basket was great to nosh on while we waited for our entrées. The Gyros plate had a good amount of meat and the meat had some nicely charred edges. It wasn't the best but a pleasant change from Kronos and had good spicing. The shoestring fries were just fine but I should have gone for the rice. For the price, an included cup of soup would have been appreciated.  My dining companion got the crab cake Benedict and it was nothing special. However, I wouldn't expect the best crab cakes from a Greek restaurant. I would expect the English muffins to be toasted though so that was a bit of a disappointment. The price was right.   I would not rush back but the meal was average, hence the three stars.

2016-11-25,1.0,"Made the mistake of going to Andies for Thanksgiving dinner as a friend suggested it because she liked going their for dinner on occasion. Made a reservation for dinner and had to wait almost half an hour . The Thanksgiving buffet was not exactly as advertised and was not replenished, and at  $26 dollars per person, it should have been. The turkey in the serving warmer looked like unappetizing scraps of the meat you would give your dog. SERIOUSLY!  DISGUSTING! There were NO mashed potatoes until about 40 minutes after we were seated!  They replenished the turkey after I noticed several people complaining. However due to poor planning there was no way you could eat your warm turkey with warm potatoes at the same time. What was missing from the ""Thanksgiving"" buffet - Stuffing and Pumpkin Pie! Can you imagine? There were many other things I could mention, but I don't want to spoil your appetite. The one decent thing was the dessert buffet (which as I mentioned earlier did not have Pumpkin Pie on it) but that's because it included fruit; and pastries that the restaurant didn't make  -  cookies petit fors and macaroons, etc. - they came from a local bakery. OH, yes and they overcharged us, but we caught it in time. A waste of our time and money.

The waitstaff was very nice and did bring water and bread, as well as take our drink order immediately.  Soup and salad came quickly, and I did enjoy the lentil soup.  Dinner entrees were a different story.  My boyfriend's cheese ravioli was tasty enough, but my seafood turine special was not even close.  The shrimp was fine, the salmon was ok albeit overcooked, but the mussels were awful.  It wasn't even that they weren't properly cooked, they just weren't fresh - fresh mussels are supposed to be pink, not gray.  I ate half of one just to see and couldn't do any more.

2016-03-06,2.0,"I hate to write a review like this one, but with so many choices on the stretch in Andersonville I wish we'd have chosen differently. We arrived to a strangely half empty restaurant with no music playing. I was excited to see a cozy fire lit in a nice fireplace, but that's where the excitement ended. We were seated and promptly brought a basket of pita - which was warm and nice - however we didn't have silverware, napkins, plates, or salt and pepper yet which made enjoying it difficult. We also didn't have olive oil or something to dip the pita in which seemed odd -- probably just personal preference but a disappointment nonetheless.  Looking back, my husband and I agreed the experience as a whole was just very odd.  The food was fine but not great and not what was reflected on the menu.  We split an order of crab cakes and though they were fine, though they were very tiny and the sauce they were served with was not good -- almost a tomato paste. I ordered the organic half chicken and chose the all white meat 2 chicken breast option. The flavor was very good, but I received a very meager portion of chicken and only 1 chicken breast portion-- a very disappointing result when a half chicken was expected. One of the chicken portions had NO meat on it-- not an exaggeration. Again, the flavor was good, but the meal as a whole was strange: The chicken came on top of raw/half cooked spinach and was served with mashed potatoes.  Additionally, we were a little bummed out by the service. Though everyone was nice, they just didn't pay much attention. Our server didn't check on our meals after they'd been delivered and a totally different server dropped off our check. The restaurant at this point was not busy, and she spent a large amount of time with the table near us (whom the owner had come to greet and apparently knew). Totally fine if we'd had what we needed and/or was checked in with to see how everything was, but that didn't happen. Thank goodness for the busser who filled waters and was a sweetheart- he got my husband more sauce, made sure our water stayed full, and wrapped what was left of our dinners at the end of the meal.

As a vegetarian, this place is heavenly.  They have - by far - the best baba ganoush in the city.  I have had baba ganoush everywhere, and nothing comes close.  I think about it all of the time, and crave it.  It has just the right smokiness and creaminess.  They always garnish their appetizers with slices of pepper, cucumber, and olives.  Did I mention the pita bread is to DIE FOR?  Best pita bread ever.   Everything I've had there - from vegetarian combinations to pasta dishes to Morrocan Eggplant to mousaka to the delicious and nicely spiced vegetarian cous cous - has been outstanding.  I've been eating here for years and if there is every anything wrong with an order or missing or not quite right, the service response is impeccable.   My favorite dish here is the spinach pie, paired with the perfect Greek salad.  The yogurt sauce accompanying this dish is something I fantasize about on a regular basis.   One last tip:  Brunch.  They have a full buffet on Sundays that is good, but I actually prefer to go on Saturdays, when they serve truly delicious omelets and potatoes with a Mediterranean flair.  And it's usually empty, so don't tell anyone.  Brunching in this neighborhood can be pretty annoying.  Not at Andies, though.   Almost forgot - don't order the baklava unless you want to have a foodgasm.",0.9109,0.798,0.118,0.084,0.6245171495171497

OK, things happen, but it should have given me a sign of things not going well.   The waiter Derrick was great, I will say that the service was good.

2015-10-22,3.0,"Ms T and I went to Andies for dinner while house sitting in A'ville.  It sounded good and came well recommended.  There was no problem getting a table even though it was a Saturday evening.  I started with a seasonal soup offering; Yellow Tomato with carrot threads and faro.  I found it harshly sour and one dimensional but it kind of grew on me and I did eat it all.  It just needed some balance.  I did like the texture that the faro added.  Ms T had a cup of the lentil soup, very simple.  She found it to be fine, nothing exceptional.  We shared a plate of Fried Calamari as we are wont to do.  Ms T thought it needed salt.  The calamari were fairly predictable except for the harissa that was almost like wing sauce, with vinegar in the chile.  I liked the change from the typical marinara that accompanies marinara. Ms T likes gyros and ordered the platter this time.  She ordered without onion, but it was delivered with onion anyway.  Fortunately the onion was extremely mild and did not stink up the table.  The serving of sliced meat was generous.  We both found it to be sliced too thin and dried out.  It was also too salty.  Flavor was rated OK, but this would be 2-1/2 stars on the gyro scale.  It was served with couscous. I decided on Chicken Breast Curry.  I do not know if curry in the Med area is typical, if so and if this is representative, it is certainly not like Indian curry.  It was in a clear-ish broth with lots and lots of the mild onion.  It was billed as being cooked with green and red bell peppers, but they were almost nonexistent.  There was a little summer squash.  It was served on the same couscous and the gyro platter.  This dish was also one dimensional, this time, just salt with some cumin.  To be honest, it was boring. We may always be expecting Greek style and flavors when we hear Mediterranean.  I wanted richer flavored dishes, kind of like when you want Hunan cuisine in a Chinese restaurant and get the Chicken in Snow Peas with the clear sauce.  I have it on good authority that this is a good place to eat and it warrants more sampling.  This meal was a weak three on the enjoyment scale.",0.9953,0.808,0.162,0.03,0.5417366946778712

2015-10-13,4.0,"I'm not sure how to express my love for this place. Maybe I can tell you that I've spent numerous Christmas Eves here. Maybe I can mention the fact that when asked where I'd like to eat around North Side Chicago I always answer: ""ANDIES!"". Or maybe the dreams I have of their dill rice. Put simply, this place deserves 5 stars when it comes to their menu. My tastebuds are alway enlightened and somehow my guests and I always end up with something complimentary... Whether it be sangria, saganaki, or desert. I highly recommend ordering off of their Specials menu!!! Usually seasonal, the specials menu has become a good friend of mine along with all of the vegetarian entrees. The Moroccan Egglant being my favorite. Prior to my pescatarian declaration about 3 years ago, I experienced the bacon wrapped, chorizo stuffed dates in some sort of delightfully light tomato sauce. This is the last meat dish I remember eating, though I know many followed. Writing it now is almost enough to convince me to drop my lifestyle diet and indulge in these beautiful dates wrapped in things I haven't tasted for years. How lovely the flavor combination, along with texture. How tragic when the plate was scrapped clean. Ahhh, the emotions sizzling inside me all thanks to these dates!! Andies has a menu that can accommodate the American steak lover, the vegetarian, the GF cousin, the ""I'm allergic to everything"" individual, and even the pizza eating, overly picky friend we all have. The venue is spacious. The service is decent (though the owner/manager  and some of the servers provide impeccable service). The food is unforgettable!

It would be nice if this were discounted or they increased the volume of sangria. other than the sangria, I felt the serving sizes and price points were pretty great.

2015-09-28,2.0,"I regret giving this place another chance. I used to come here all the time years ago and it was always great. Then the service, quality, and quantity of food changed and I just stopped going. I came in on a Friday night by accident...so we decided to stay for dinner. The service was 2 stars, maybe 3 because of how they handled the following described experience. The food was 0.5-1 star. We ordered hummus and calamari for appetizer then the combination kabob. We received the hummus and pita...pita was stale and hard, hummus was ok but I noticed they only skim a thin layer of hummus on the plate then thicken it up around the circumference on the plate....so you don't get much hummus it just looks like a lot lol.  The waitress asked if she should put our order in now because the calamari takes a long time to make. Which confused us because as soon as she walked away another waiter came to give us the calamari. The calamari was the worse I have ever had. It looked like it was fried in a ball, it looked awful on the plate and it tasted that way too. The calamari was hard, chewy, and tasted very fishy! I refused to eat the rest because I was scared to get sick. The waitress asked how we liked it and we shared our opinion. AND she admitted that most people say the same thing lol Then she asked if we wanted another one.....we said no. Our kabobs were ok. The steak kabob was hot and done to our liking. The veggies and rice were cold though. The dill rice seemed like they had regular long grain rice, went to their backyard to rip some dill leaves, then without chopping it just toss it together with the rice. I've had so much better from the restaurant next door to this place.  The manager handled the situation well and offered desert on the house and took out the calamari off our order. When the waitress came with a platter of all the deserts they offered, my BF chose the tiramisu. 7 min later she came back and said they actually don't have any tiramisu. She offered something else and at that point we just really didn't care for desert and asked her for the check. She came back with the check and insisted we take a brownie to go. I'm just never coming back here again because of the food. I felt like I was on an episode of Hell's Kitchen lol",0.9515,0.811,0.114,0.076,0.47036468433527256

Every time I go now, I always request to be seated in Josh's section because his service is superb. I always have my two young children with me and I know servers usually dislike waiting on tables with children, but Josh was always so accommodating and never seemed annoyed, which has always earned him generous tips.  On to the food.. The food has always been consistently delicious. I always order either their seasonal risotto or their shrimp risotto. Their portions are generous so you'll have leftovers. For dessert, I typically order the cheesecake which has crumbled pistachios and drizzled with honey. Their red wine selection is only okay, but I'm kind of a wine snob, so I usually let this slide at restaurants. They do have a decent white wine list, but I don't drink white wine.

My husband and I like to enjoy date nights alone, but sometimes we have to bring our 3.5 year old son. We couldn't believe the first two times we came in, the staff opened their arms to us and by the time our son was seated there was a brand new toy for him to play with, a bowl of crayons and a water cup with lid ready before we could even sit down. It's not a restaurant you would think is super kid friendly because there are usually adults with sans kids, but they went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and allow us to still enjoy a great ""adult"" evening. The atmosphere is great too! We love sitting by the open windows to take in the great restaurant ambiance but also to have the exposure to the sidewalk and people watching.

The way they serve it is with diced red onions, cucumber, kalamata olives and carrots. They serve it with a bowl of warm pita bread. And, wow, it was good. They have an extensive menu, and they also have a seasonal menu making the choice even harder. But, I settled on lamb cous-cous while my son chose a stuffed lamb burger.

There was a little pink with much grey - med well. She returned it to the kitchen willingly, offered soup or salad which we declined, and brought back a new steak. It barely had touched the grill!

The so-called Saffron sauce was also inundated with Rosemary - no subtlety at all.  I was able to ""down"" about 1/4 of the dish beforte the chest and esophagus pains made me think - this is not a good idea.  I couldn't touch the rest.  My brother in law was kind enough to oiffer me some of his gyros plate.  I'm giving one star because the service was very solicitous and the restaurant manager was friendly and experienced.  Chicken Basil should be Chicken Basil though - not Chicken ROSEMARY....  Perhaps a better name would have been Atomic Chicken Rosemary and Rosemary Saffron Sauce that would have warned the unsuspecting diner.  Haven't tried Andies for a few years.  Probably the last time although I'm a forgiving sort (next time Gyros or Chicken Kabob - how can you Rosemary-ize that?).  Reza's next door in Andersonville and the Mediterranen Cafe in Lincoln Square are so much better.  I don't enjoy being negative, but I can't say how much the Rosemary drenched chicken dish disappointed me - and was physically painful.",-0.7567,0.74,0.125,0.135,0.5975308641975308

2014-01-19,5.0,"I've enjoyed Andies on Clark several times in the past.  Andies' offerings are a cut above other 'mediterranean' restaurants- Andies' fare is MORE SAVORY, and rates lower on the grease-o-meter. I am particularly fond of their LAMB OSSO BUCCO. The better entries at Andies are not CHEAP, but I think given the quality of  their ingredients and preparation they offer honest value for money.  And they do have sandwiches and lighter fare which are less costly if your bank is light.  I've experienced good service and a nice quiet-but-not-dead atmosphere. So tonight I thought I'd try their DELIVERY. I live near Western and Lawrence, which is pretty far from the restaurant- even so, the food arrived within about 35 minutes and was fresh and hot.  That was quite impressive.  The delivery meal was just as tasty as the same dish (Moroccan B'stilla) eaten in their dining room.  For delivery food, it really is one of the better options. Their delivery charge is very reasonable. (Their b'stilla is a little different from some others I have tasted- Andies b'stilla is not nearly as sweet as others I've tried, and it stands more on flavorful seasonings and skilled preparation than the over-salted versions I've had elsewhere. ) Another thing I like about Andies is that they are open ""late-ish.""  I'm a night-owl, and being able to get a really nice meal after 10 PM is a big plus in my book.

I like the menu so much because it isn't boring. This is not just a gyro place, this is not just a restaurant for kebabs and couscous. Yes you can get that here but I think they do really well at offering more unique dishes than I'm used to getting at the Mediterranean restaurants I've been to. Short ribs over polenta with hearty vegetables, lamb osso boco, pumpkin and squash soups, salads and appetizers on their Fall Specials, risotto and gnocchi, Indian inspired dishes like lamb Biryani and Tandoori with dates and yogurt, seafood and Moroccan dishes and Tagines! God I could go on. There are so many amazing looking choices and I want them all. I highly recommend looking at their menu on line and being floored by all the amazing choices you have to pick from.  Plus they have an entire vegetarian and gluten free menu! They have their own gluten free pita! As best as I can remember I have had the Spicy Beef & Chicken Biryani that was super delicious served with lots of vegetables and rice. It was great leftover. I've had the Trio Kebab which is beef filet, beef kefta and chicken served with couscous. Their couscous is really excellent, well spiced. I've had their special Chianti braised Beef Short Ribs over polenta with veg, plus their huge Greek chicken salad when I'm pretending to be healthy. Boyfriend has recently had their Lamb Couscous and their special, the pork loin with chimichurri sauce. I couldn't believe how many pork loins he was served, they were melt in your mouth with delicious asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes. He had a mushroom gnocchi in a cream sauce from their specials that looked pretty sinful. We've had their Medjool dates stuffed with chorizo and bacon for an appetizer.

This place is awesome for its variety and everything is really delicious.

2013-10-09,2.0,"This was an unfortunate night for my mother and I. We had been here a few times before, and had positive memories of the place. Now she's moved back in the area so we decided to check it out because we had a hankering for Greek food. Outside of the saganaki, which was pretty good, the food was pretty disappointing. Like really disappointing. We additionally decided to split a large Greek salad and also got taramosalata. The salad probably cost the restaurant less than $2 to produce because it was almost all iceberg lettuce, with very little feta cheese or olives or anything else and the dressing was lackluster. Biggest waste of money I've had in a long time. Then the taramosalata that broke my heart. My mother and I both love it normally, but when it came out it was more liquidy than hummus, and warm. We both had never received it this way, and did point it out to our waiter. He extremely apologetic, and said it had just been made so that's why it was warm. But in my opinion then he should have said we're actually out of it right now, because if I were Greek I would have been very upset receiving that. Generally our waiter was cordial and professional, though I have to say when he said ""I'm so sorry this has never happened before"" I got the feeling he has said that line a few times before... But as I said, he was very nice, we replaced the taramosalata for the dolmas which were okay. Also lacking in flavor. But we received a complimentary box of four small pieces of baklava which weren't bad.

2013-08-12,2.0,"Short version: Bad food, poor service - I've had better in small towns in Indiana! Having looked over the reviews other people have written, it seems that you either have a great experience here or a crappy one, with no in-between.  Unfortunately for us, we were here on a crappy night, with bad service and mediocre food.  I hate to write a bad review, but this experience was so unusual for most of my experience dining in Chicago that I feel compelled to share it. The pita bread was good, but it was dropped off well in advance of the hummus we'd ordered as our appetizer, which meant that by the time the hummus arrived it was no longer warm. The hummus itself was okay; it was a little lumpy (not necessarily a bad thing) and the flavors were boring (I actually squeezed the lemon slice over it in an attempt to liven it up a bit). Maybe a little salt would have helped, but there were no seasonings on any of the tables, so I guess this is a no-salt sort of place? For dinner - which took a while to order, as our waiter was somehow responsible for both the outside tables and for us, and kept disappearing - my husband had the chicken pastry (b'stilla, I think it was called?) and I had the pomegranate chicken.  Both were... okay.  His pastry seemed fine (I tried some) but the couscous that came with it was pretty blah, although the cucumber-yogurt sauce was good. Mine? Oof, where to begin. The chicken itself was pounded into a flat piece of meat that tasted a bit overdone, and was slathered in a thick layer of pomegranate sauce with raisins and some almond slices.  It was mostly just thick and sweet, and lacked the tanginess I was hoping for. It was okay. The mashed potatoes - which the waiter had warned me would be ""garlicky"" - were lumpy and not very flavorful at all.  Again, having some salt might have helped. (Is the chef on a low salt diet or something?)  But it was the ""seasonal vegetables"" that were the worst. In August, when the farmers' markets are full of all kinds of interesting things, the ""seasonal vegetables"" were nothing more than broccoli and carrots.  Worse, they were badly cooked broccoli and carrots; the broccoli was grey and looked boiled _and_ burnt, and all of it was spiced with some African spice that overwhelmed without actually being tasty.  I ate one bite and couldn't bear to try another. And then it was more waiting, first for the bill, then for the waiter to return to pick up the card, and then to return with the card and credit slip.  And no one checked in to see how we were doing, leaving us to just sit there, bored and still somewhat hungry, until we could escape. Honestly, this is the worst meal I've had in a Chicago restaurant in several years of eating out in the city, and it was disappointing to have it come at a price point that led me to expect something not only better but much better. We did not, needless to say, stick around for dessert, and I do not plan to eat here again. If you choose to take a chance on this place, hope that you get them in a good moment, because if you don't, it is awful.",0.8903,0.759,0.129,0.111,0.5937158469945356

(yikes) ... I also tasted the steak because it looked good on the plate but when I took a bite it was grizzled and unseasoned.. the other late dish was a chicken tandori that was apparently inedible.  Both dishes ended up being comped, which I do admire, but it didn't make up for this bad experience.  After we were out the door, I heard they then wanted to comp us a cheesecake... but uh.. we were already outside so we took a pass...

We ordered the baba ghanouj which was creamy, lemony, and served with the softest and greatest tasting pita. Nothing like you get in those greasy, quick- medi places on Belmont.

I almost had enough to take home for leftovers -- the portions are HUGE, but I finished almost all of my chicken so I passed. You could easily split a lot of different dishes here for about $14 a person! We splurged with the tiramisu since we are both May babies and she gave us a huge corner piece! Love it.

The interior of the restaurant is actually nicer than the pictures I saw on here prior to going to the restaurant( at first I thought we were going to some kind of half way fast food mediterranean place). Also, they have hand towels in the bathroom, which reminds me of luxurious bathrooms in hotels.  However, the big downer is the food. Very mediocre and not authentic. Lacks flavors as well. We ordered the Kibbeh with mashed potato side and Moroccan eggplants with dill rice. For appetizer we had the dipping sauces platter of hummus, yogurt, baba ghanouj and mashed red pepper. Is it sad to say that I almost like their complimentary pita more than our entrees? The kibbeh was way too dry and hard, it came with this sour sauce that was dark brown in color (the worst part is the sauce). The Moroccan eggplant was a tad better, but it was just average overall, the dill rice tasted better than the eggplant. The appetizer of different dips was below average, the best out of the four choices being the yogurt sauce. We paid $12 for that appetizer, that was a disappointment to get such blahh food. We ran out of pita on our table when our appetizer was carried out to our table. The person who carried our food out was not intuitive enough to refill our pitas. After he dropped the food off he soon left, no one came to refill our pita or was our waiter anywhere to be found. How are we supposed to eat dips without bread, oh it gets better, we were also never given utensils either until we finally asked for them when our main entrees were carried out, which took at least a good half hour.  What I was not happy about was our waiter completely disappeared on us after he took our order. When we were first seated he wrote his name on our paper table cloth...very unique but what is the point of knowing your name if we will never see you again? Well our experience was somewhat redeemed at the end when ANOTHER waiter came to help us, she refilled our water and then after that the owner of the restaurant asked us how our dining experience was. We didn't want to be rude, so we gave the standard, ""it was good"" reluctantly.  As we paid and were walking out of the restaurant, we were handed a $5 coupon to come back as a ""thanks for dining with us"" deal. Well, looks like this restaurant needs a customer boost huh... Overall this restaurant is overpriced, the food is very average and the whole logistics of the restaurant needs to be smoothed out, too many overlooked details. The owner needs to train his staffs better! P.S. in the front of the restaurant under the name Andie's, it says ""Greek, Moroccan,  and Lebanese Cuisine"".

Like almost everyone there, we ordered the flaming cheese. What's not to like? It gives off what is probably the best smell ever, it bursts into flames, and it's deelicious. Everything else we ordered off the specials menu, which our waiter suggested we look at closely. The chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in proscuitto were spectacular: the tomato sauce they were served with had an unusually distinctive flavor profile, and we mopped it all up with the pita they put on the table as a starter. My husband had the seafood tagine, which was full of seafood and vegetables and served in a rustic stoneware tagine. He gave it two thumbs up. I had the moroccan chicken b'stilla, which I'd read about in a cookbook once, and was excited to have a chance to try. It was delicious, full of chicken and raisins and other delights, and less sweet than I'd imagined. The couscous it was served with had a slightly smoky tomato flavor, and was very pleasantly aromatic. The waitstaff were extremely accommodating, and brought over a tiramisu with a candle for my husband. To our great delight, they comped it! We had it with the turkish coffee for two, which was dark and unctuous.  We got there fairly early - a little before six - and the place filled up by the time we left around seven fifteen. It's very spacious and pleasant inside. We joked about how the service was so good that we would have to deduct a star from the yelp review because the perfectly honed balance of attention and space was a little disconcerting.

I've been here several times and tried many dishes, and can honestly say I haven't had anything I didn't like. The sangria is also delicious! Service can be a little slow, but that's really just part of the dining experience. This isn't an eat and get out sort of restaurant, but rather somewhere to have an nice long meal.

I absolutely LOVE the service I receive there.  All of their servers are well-trained, professional, and courteous.  I watched how they worked with all their tables and everyone gets the same treatment, which is outstanding.  I couldn't believe how attentive, yet not overwhelming the servers are.  The manager also made himself present and known and walked around the restaurant making sure everyone was doing well. The ambiance is great; there is a fireplace, a skylight, and a separate bar area.  The lighting is nice as well. not too bright and not too dark.  they have a coat rack in the front too so the restaurant isn't cluttered with handsbags, scarves, and purses since it's winter. The food is incredible. I have tried the herb greek chicken, the greek stufffed chicken, the flaming cheese dish (the name escapes me), the chocolate/peanut butter dessert, the pita, the crab cakes, the rice, and their arugula salad.  Everything left me wanting more.  They also cook seasonally appropriate foods which makes me very happy. I take my friends to this place now when they come from out of town. its amazing. I have tipped $20 every time I have gone there because of how outstanding my experience is. This place is just so damn good, all around! The Mediterranean cuisine has never been my favorite, but this place has greatly changed my opinion.  With so many great Italian places nearby as well as other fun, popular restaurants, this restaurant is ALWAYS my first choice in Andersonville &  Edgewater. Seriously - eat here. The pita alone is also hot, fresh, and fluffy. so delicious. mmmm. now i'm hungry again. oh, and prices are totally reasonable too. def. afffordable. i love this place! they also brought us complimentary desserts tonight for staying around and just chillin' in the restaurant. how nice!   mad love and respect for Andies.",0.9957,0.73,0.211,0.059,0.6039351851851852

2013-01-08,5.0,"After not being here for a few years, things have actually improved since I was here last. I thought Andie's was a great place for Mediterranean food after the first time I went, but now they've got that traditional edge with their style of cuisine as well as some GLUTEN-FREE PITA. I've been on a hunt for a long time for gluten-free pita, and I always imagined finding it and having to spend an outrageous amount of money for some. However, Andie's treated the gluten-free pita the same as regular pita, and they brought it out free of charge at the beginning of our meal.  Gluten-free items are also clearly labeled on the menu which is not a usual thing for most restaurants(although a lot of restaurants are starting to catch on to the trend, thank the lord). Aside from Andie's becoming my new GF savior, the food was delicious. We got the sampler plate with the usual hummus, ghannouj, patata, and harissa. The harissa was probably the best thing on that plate. It was spicy, yet surprisingly sweet.  I went with a simple chicken and beef kefta kabob order. I was in need of some solid Mediterranean staples. Nothing to complain about there. Our server was extremely friendly too. My friend and I were there to catch up on the past five months where we had barely talked to each other, and although we didn't tell him this, our waiter caught that we weren't in a rush at all so he gave us some space.  We also left with some five dollar gift certificates for the next time around which I hope will be in the near future.  Also just realized that it's called Andie's because it's in Andersonville.

2013-01-03,4.0,"Admittedly, I love Mediterranean food.  I love a little tang, a little grill action, lemony essence, vegetarian options front and center, herby flavors and generally eating below the fat danger zone.  So a place would have to either execute poorly or have service issues to earn a thumb's down.  Andie's serves good food, and graciously. It's among the most solid and reliable places in my orbit.      My faves include the baba ghannouj, which is smoky and smooth.  They take up some precious plate real estate with a couple nasty little olives, which I realize some people like, but that's the only drawback.  Their pita is fat and thick, so factor that into your carb calculations for the day.  But the b-g itself is great.   I recently tried the lentil soup, and I never met a lentil soup I didn't like.  Theirs is in the good, but not super special category.  There were whole lentils, which I wholeheartedly approve of.   My favorite vegetarian entree is the sauteed spinach and garbanzos over rice.  They combine two superfoods and flavor it up with a little onion, feta and lemon.  My only wish would be more garbanzos and fewer supporting veggies (onion, etc.).  I've also had the chicken kabob which was just right.  The basil and chicken over rice was good as well but could use more basil (but what couldn't?).     The service is probably the friendliest on Clark, and we always leave with a coupon for next time.  When we were there recently with my husband's parents, the gave us a complimentary plate of baklava.  The staff bring their W game (w for warm) every time.  It's possibly to entice customers to return instead of trying Reza's next door, but whatever, it's nice.

2012-09-05,5.0,"A simple truth suddenly crystallized in the murk of my mind last week:  Andie's is one of my favorite mid-range restaurants in the city.  And it probably always has been, but now that I live in the neighborhood, I've been eating here often enough to call it so.  It has become a regular option for casual Friday night dinners, not to mention frequent carryout. They STILL make probably the best restaurant baba ghannouj anywhere.  The kabobs are excellent too, but recently I've been branching out and trying some of the more non-standard menu items.  Under the vegetarian section, there is a dish called ""portabella over lentil""; such a simple moniker belies the wonderful flavors of this dish.  There are carrots and onions as well as the two main ingredients.  Last week I ate the vegetable mousaka--another winner.  Pair it up with the dill rice and take home your leftovers for a knockout lunch.  Or breakfast. A note on the fried calamari:  it has a unique flavor that I can't put my finger on, but which I've never detected in any other calamari (and I eat a lot of it).  Plus they put parmesan on top and serve it with a haressa-tinged marinara.  It adds up to an unorthodox calamari, but it works. Service is always so gracious--everyone is all smiles and practically falls all over themselves to help you.  The last two visits, we've had Jessica, who is fantastic.  Plus they give out $10 off coupons as a ""thank-you""/""please come again soon"" but in our case, we hardly need any further incentive (although we appreciate the savings).   Honestly, I can't think of a more consistently pleasant and satisfying dinner spot.  I love Andie's.",0.9972,0.78,0.22,0.0,0.5441514041514041

2012-07-21,2.0,"Had to edit my review after looking at my left overs in the daylight.  Wow!  I really didn't eat my main entree when I ordered it at 10 p.m. on Saturday night because I got a salad and a dip before dinner.  By Monday morning, the veggies wouldn't have turned bad that quickly.  The food was simply not fresh. The broccoli was yellow/green (i.e. not fresh).  All of the vegetables were clearly stuff they had to get rid of because it was going bad.  The vegetables were all soggy and clearly not fresh. Yuk! I wish I could give this place more stars but I really can't. A++ for service.  My waitress, Casandra, couldn't have been nicer and more accommodating.  I really liked her. As for the food, the taste is mediocre but the portions are really really way too small for the price.  It's a bit on the pricey side, which would be OK if the portions were at least average, but they are not. I've been there a handful of times.  Love the atmosphere.  I really like their big windows and outdoor seating.  I like the location as well.  I think I returned to Andie's more for the atmosphere than anything else really. Their saganaki is ridiculous.  Cost as much as any Greek/Mediterranean restaurant would charge, but the portion was so small it really ended up being all burnt cheese with no cheese in the middle after it was done cooking in the fire.  That's the best way I can describe it.  I've had their vegetarian entree before too and it really could pass for an appetizer.  Not much food.  How expense could hummus be to make?? Come on...  I make it homemade and the portion they serve would cost me 15 cents to make, literally. If you're really hungry you should probably order something else or go somewhere else to eat.  Not a lot of food. Tonight I got the beet and mango salad.  It was delicious but way too small.  Again, one more hand full of mixed greens wouldn't ruin the business. Serve a decent size or lower the price.  I also got the garlic dip, which was good.  Maybe just a bit on the small side for the price, but unlike the salad, not really way too small I suppose. I also got the chicken and shrimp kabobs.  The kabobs were cooked well.  Not over done. Chicken was moist and good.  The portion for the meat/seafood for this dish was on the small side considering the price.  The chicken could have used more flavor.  They, of course, gave plenty of rice and cous cous of course to make you think you are getting your money's worth when you really are not. Load up the plate with the cheap filler while not giving enough meat to justify the price of the dish.  I was leaning towards the cous cous but couldn't decide.  The waitress said she thought the dill rice was good.  She was nice enough to offer to give me half cous cous and half dill rice, so I did that.  She was right.  The dill rice was much better than the cous cous, which I did not enjoy.  I really wish they would serve the yellow rice that is found often in many Middle Eastern kabob places.  That rice has so much more flavor than the dill rice they serve.   I had a coupon that I used tonight.  I would not go to Andie's again because of the food not being fresh and the portion sizes (especially in light of the prices). Perhaps Reza's next door is more generous in their portions so I suppose I will give them a try next time.",0.9957,0.827,0.126,0.047,0.44432485322896276

We told the server that it was bad and we didn't want anything else and just the check. He took 50% off the 4 meals that we didn't eat instead of taking it off the check. Server did not seem to care that we had a bad experience nor did the manager who didn't even come by our table but we had to tell on the way out the door. Wrote a letter and never heard from them. I have never written a review but this experience was so awful I felt compelled to tell people DO NOT GO!!! We had to go across the street and have brunch someplace else after wasting our time and money there.,-0.9635,0.836,0.011,0.153,0.8154761904761906

We were disappointed that we couldn't get what we were craving but ended up having a great experience at Andie's. The service was stellar.

As for the food- phenomenal! I had the shrimp and steak kabobs, both were cooked perfectly.  I tried the dill rice, first time I ever had it, and I am already craving it again.  It was light and fresh, the distinct punch of dill balanced quite well with the basmati.  My brother raved about the meal he had, and we both agreed that the pita was amazing. There were just a few missteps that keep me from giving 5 stars-  The baba ghanoush needed salt, but our server overheard us say this and promptly brought some out.  And with dessert, they had a caramel custard.  I asked our server if it was a baked or set custard, he said set so I ordered it, expecting something like a  panna cotta that's set with gelatin.  It was a baked custard (no biggie) but was pretty far overbaked and coagulated.  The flavor on it was great, just texture was off.   Those minor setbacks are not enough to keep me from coming back though, I've found a new favorite restaurant!

Negatives: I'm not opposed to small portions (in fact I love small dinners), but I thought that everything was somewhat overpriced for the amount you are given. My friend ordered the crab cakes for about $13. There were 2, and they were a little dinky-looking. I had the vegetarian combo plate however, also about $13, and it was more than enough for me (my friend also shared some of it, and there were STILL leftovers!) Also, our waiter was kind of awkward at times. He just seemed a little harried, probably because he was so busy. Positives: Definitely outweigh the negatives! When I asked where the cucumber sauce was on my veg platter, our waiter informed me that it was drizzled over the falafel, but he brought me an extra little serving of it anyway to try by itself! Also, my friend and I had to rush through dinner, so at the end of the meal I was looking for our waiter to get the check. When I couldn't find him, the gentleman standing at the host station noticed me looking around and came over to bring our bill for us. When he did bring the bill, he also brought out a couple of pieces of baklava for us to have. Yum!! Also, I asked our waiter if I could take my leftovers home (because it was so good) and he said yes, but may have forgotten. I asked him about it and he apologized for forgetting. I told him it was absolutely no big deal and was getting ready to leave, but he AND THE HOST insisted on dishing me up more of everything that was on the vegetarian platter (including more pita).

The food was not as good as I was hoping it would be.  My older brother and his girlfriend frequent Andie's, and it was on their recommendation that we went.  We started with appetizers which were pretty good--the combo of delicious Mediterranean spreads, fried calamari (the only app my dad would touch), and falafel.  The entrees were what left a little to be desired.  I had a trio of kebabs--kefta (ground beef), filet, and chicken.  My biggest criticism would be that the food was under-seasoned.  Not enough salt.  And that's coming from someone who often under-seasons his own cooking; I like people to enjoy the flavors of the foods and not just the salt.  I remember seeing a note on the menu to not ask for salt for your table, as well.  This is another pet peeve of mine: when a restaurant tries to control your tastes for you.  Anyhow, I also tried my mom's dinner which was a lamb couscous.  It was hearty and had nice spice to it, but didn't knock either of our socks off.

The Sea Bass didn't look or taste like Sea Bass and came with a potato casserole layered with phyllo.  The Casserole was frozen solid in the middle.  We alerted the waiter who took the plate away and told us that her dinner would be on the house.   A few minutes later her replacement meal arrived.  The person who brought it out told us it was ""extremely hot"" and then set it down right in front of our daughter, who, as 15 month old children will do, reached out and touched the fish which burned her hand.  Thankfully it wasn't too bad. The food was scorching hot, in only the way that a microwave can heat food, and proved to be unappetizing as well.  She managed a few bytes before sharing some of my chicken.

It's just a pity that traffic on Clark is usually so heavy & the street almost butts right to the tables that you end up eating more exhaust fumes then food if you sit there but that's Chicago. With any restaurant that has a great many items on the menu, quality will always suffer as it will when a restaurant is so popular that it's often totally packed and so it is with Andie's like on weekend nights. It's a trade off, you either go to  Greece or Italy or Lebanon or get a meal that is reminiscent of it, at places like this. So what we have here is a basic tourist Feed Hall and the tourist can be actual tourist from like Iowa or Nebraska or working in Chicago residents that are also from like, allover the map, sort of resident tourist.

The atrocious decor that would have been considered dated 30 years ago was illuminated in all the wrong places with very harsh lighting.  My date and I asked to be seated at an open window table but were informed that the section was closed and instead offered an internal table (rule #1 of window tables...fill them FIRST to create a lively environment which lures passers-by into the restaurant).  Our waiter wrote his name on the table with a sharpie...I wondered if that was for our benefit, or to remind himself which tables were his. On to the food.  The menu is ENORMOUS and reads like a Greek tragedy.  It is not possible to highlight fresh, imaginative items when there are over 100 dishes competing for your attention.  Plus a full page of specials.  Hoping to set the bar low I ordered the Trio Kabobs of chicken, steak (medium-well) and kefta with dill rice.  The chicken was tender and juicy (if a bit oily) but the chef confused ""medium-well steak"" with ""dry shoe leather"".  The rice had so much dill that I'm still picking it out of my teeth.  It is a powerful herb and just a kiss, softened with a squeeze of lemon juice, is normally enough for even the least discriminating Chicagoan's palate.  It was inedible.  But the worst was the kefta, which looked and tasted like something extruded out the back of a cruise ship and plopped into the Mediterranean sea.  I've had better Greek food at Chinese carry-outs. Upon settling our bill (but not my stomach) we bolted for the door.  The manager handed us two $5 gift certificates for a future visit.  It was a friendly gesture, but with food that bad, I will not be redeeming them anytime soon.",0.9239,0.781,0.128,0.091,0.5245312499999999

Grubhub is AWESOME. After checking with the restaurant, they assure me that our food will be here in about 10 minutes and then give us a gift card to Grubhub to make up for our inconvenience. 15 more minutes pass, our food FINALLY arrives, and we are missing one of our drinks.

2010-11-12,2.0,"I guess there's a reason why places do restaurant dot com....they just aren't all that great.  I've purchased a lot of $25 for $2 coupons and for the most part, have been either moderately satisfied or downright disappointed.  Here's another example of the latter...though there is a major caveat for Andies, and that is the outstanding service we received from the owner's Son who was the floor manager the night we came...if i'm honest, it actually pains me a bit to give the place a 2 star b/c he was so genuinely nice and gracious about the whole ordeal. Aesthetically, the place is a bit contrived but still maintains a comfortable charm about itself.  The complimentary pita bread was decent, not warm iirc and tasted pretty pedestrian.   Chose the $12 Pinot Noir wine flight which came with 3 wines - about a 3-4 oz pour each.  The wines were Alice White ($7 bottle at the store?) and two others I recognized name-wise but can't recall right now...not bad but would stick to a glass of my choice if done again. The main courses were where things went downhill.  She chose the Lamb Kabob which was listed as ""20 inches"" (insert phallic joke here) but came out with a meager four pieces of lamb which were dry, somewhat fatty and definitely not flavorful.  When we asked our server about the 20 inch claim he stated that the veggies betwixt the lamb counted as well.....lolz, fine.  It came with Basmati Dill Rice and even  that was dry, seemingly undercooked and overall just pretty bad. I ordered the shrimp and salmon which came with a white wine sauce (overly rich) on a bed of mashed potatoes (reminiscent of Uni dorm room boxed style).  The worst part though ??  The Salmon was bad...and I mean like irrefutably and literally.  The Salmon was outdated and left the worst aftertaste after the first bite.  Starving, I ate the shrimp (decent) and put the salmon to the side.  We mentioned this to our server and he summons the manager who quickly addressed the issue by 1. giving us a full Steak Kabob  with Veggies and rice 2. two orders of some of the best tasting Baklava i've ever had 3. a complimentary entree upon next visit and finally 4. (and the best part, as even average to bad food for free is, well, still average or bad,right?) was his honest to goodness sincerity about our negative experience.  The guy was born for the restaurant industry imo as this is something that not may can pull off, he basically made a pretty bad dining experience seem like an afterthought to his good natured personality in empathizing with our situation.",0.9872,0.737,0.166,0.098,0.5899675324675325
2010-10-11,3.0,"Three lovely ladies (myself included) went for lunch/brunch at Andies on this past, picture-perfect, 80-degree Sunday. Andies has tables on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant, and I quickly spotted a 4-top that had been vacated recently. It still had the remains of dirty plates and the payment booklet. I went indoors and asked a waiter at the host desk if someone could possibly clean that off, so we could sit there. He did dispatch a busser, and we sat down very quickly. Within about a minute, we had water, silverware, and a plate of their hot, homemade pita bread. Very delicious! The scene was lovely, and all the other tables on the sidwalk were occupied by people at various stages of their meals. Now, my friends, comes the part where I tell you why Andies does not get another star from me. The lovely ladies who really, really wanted to be lunch ladies chatted, lingered, looked longingly at the other diners getting food, getting drinks, paying bills, all sorts of restaurant-y things, all from servers. Friends, we sat there, literally, 20 minutes, with our water, rapidly-diminishing basket of bread, and growling stomachs, hoping, praying, that one of the serving staff would notice that we were sitting there sans menu, sans service. You'd think the sound of my growling stomach alone would be enough to bring over a horde of restaurant personnel, desperate to do anything to quiet the roar. We did get our water refilled regularly. No waiter. Finally, I said to the other ladies, I'm about to get up and go get a waiter, when one of the ladies - more action-oriented than talk-oriented - DID get up, go inside, and ask for service help. She was back in about a minute, closely followed by a waiter. Well, we finally did get service. Two of us ordered the Tunisian Eggs, which was served with potatoes and fresh fruit. The third had crepes with apples and walnuts. Everything was delicious. The price was reasonable. And once the server was notified that we were actually living breathing adults who might possibly have credit cards, things were okay. Friends, I worked in the restaurant industry for 20 years, until my knees couldn't take it anymore. I am very, very understanding and sympathetic and empathetic to what happens in restaurants. BUT -- there is no excuse for letting a table sit that long. The servers were not slammed. They were just unprofessional. Would I go to Andies again? Probably, if there's a group going, or someone really really wants to eat there. I might have a snack beforehand, in case of poor service. If you're eating at a sit-down restaurant, service is an integral part of the successful equation. A day later, I am still disgustipated about this.  Food - 4 stars. Service - 2 stars. Average - 3 stars. And I think I'm being generous here.",0.9716,0.862,0.1,0.039,0.5181939356939358

Service wasn't bad, pretty straightforward. I went with the hummus, falafel, and these interesting potatoes stuffed with vegetables. All around just regular. Hummus was a little too garlic-y with little bread to dip it in. The falafel was good, but really was just four tiny falafel sliced in half. Meh.

I ordered the lamb kabob and - let me preface by saying I have never had lamb outside the gyro setting so maybe all lamb tastes like this - it was a bit chewy, overdone by just a little.  However, it was served with side salad that was fine (standard cucumber, lettuce, dressing) and the grilled vegetables that were also on the kabob were cooked perfectly, with great seasonings. They gave me Tzatziki sauce on the side which worked perfectly both on the kabob and as a sub for the unsatisfactory salad dressing.  Oh! I almost forgot about the bread basket. The pita bread they served was standard, and would have been much improved with a little oil / vinegar, or dip, even butter would have been fine. Plain pita bread is better than no pita bread - but I was surprised they served it up plain like they did.

2010-04-02,1.0,"Dear Andies, Not okay to serve: a) hummus that has been sitting out on a counter, neither heated nor refrigerated, long enough to be hard and dry around the edges, b) ravioli that pretty clearly contains a different filling than the one specified on the menu, c) ravioli has been microwaved to the point where the asparagus on top looks like it was overcooked and then thrown in the trash and then taken out again, or any plate of food that is hot in the center and lukewarm on the outside, d) any food, especially pasta, that has been microwaved AT ALL, especially at $13 a plate. Also not okay to have downright miserable service, give me attitude when I've been super nice to you ALL night (even though you made every effort to completely ignore me) and ask you really nicely if I got the wrong ravioli, or charge me for both the nasty special I ordered, AND the nasty replacement dinner I ordered.

2009-12-30,5.0,"The meat on my entree was basically inedible yet I'm giving this place a solid five star rating.  Why, you ask?  Well, its all about customer service. We decided to bring an out-of-town guest to Andies upon her arrival to Chicago last night.  Remembering the fabulous meal I had there last month, my mouth was salivating at the thought of another great dinner at Andies.  However, when my entree of kabobs arrived, I was incredibly disappointed.  The steak kabob was particularly chewy and gross.  It was like gristle.  Getting through the first bite was tough and by the second, I ended up having to use my napkin to spit out my food.  Urgh.  Such disappointment.  But at the same time, I was engrossed in conversation with my dinner companions so I didn't say much.  After a bit of time, our server came to check on us and noticed my plate was barely touched.  He immediately inquired and I politely told him why I had stuck to the couscous and left the beef.  He was very apologetic, without being overbearing and offered to bring me another dish.  By then, I'd filled up on the couscous enough that the thought of another meal was just not something to consider.  He apologized once more and instructed me to let him know if I changed my mind.  A few minutes later, the manager came over and we had a similar round of conversation.  I never felt pressure and he certainly didn't waste time on being defensive which I appreciated.  Instead, it was clear his genuine desire was to make it right.  He insisted on taking the entree off our bill and in tern, I assured him that I was full enough not to require another meal prepared.  We continued on with our meal and as my friends finished their entrees (which they said were delicious), the manager came out with a complimentary baklava.  It was amazing and left the meal on such a positive note for everyone at the table.   What it boils down to is this - despite a poor entree, Andies has secured a spot as a Chicago favorite for one simple reason -  I know that if I go there, they will do anything and everything to make sure I walk out a happy customer.  And really... what more can you ask for?",0.9936,0.802,0.165,0.033,0.42721669583371713

Years of loyal patronage meant nothing. Worst of all though was the food. It just wasn't the same. It was like they had traded off flavor for decor.

2009-09-06,3.0,"I have been to Andy's 3 different times now and each experience was very differening, but overall I would say I like it a lot. The first time I went was with my friend Liz.  The only thing that I really remember from that particular time was that when they brought me the bill, rather than charging my debit card $32, they charged it $3200.  It all got sorted out, and despite that I still very much like the place. The second time was for my birthday after a Cubs game; I was pretty enebreated (sp?) so I don't really remember much about what I hate, but I was there with family and friends so I had a good time. Andy's is right next door to Reza's which is another VERY good mediterranean restaurant, however, I feel that Andy's menu is much more expansive.  They also have a healthy and vegan/veg portion of the menu (albeit I didn't order from that last night) which I think is very helpful.  They honestly have everything.  My cousins, aunt and I all had a hard time landing on exactly it was that we wanted to eat because there was so much to choose from and everything sounded so delicious. My one cousin who was not exactly ecstatic to eat there because she has very particular tastes and doesn't like anything non-American, actually found something and she seemed to like it. What I love is that they put warm pita on the table and I don't know what it is about their pita, but it's very fresh and delicious.  Honest to God, I think I had like 5.  For appetizers we got calamari (which was fabulous, however, I thought the sauce that it came with was a bit too spicy), and hummos.  Honestly, their hummos was not the best that I have ever tried.  As my cousin and I acknowledged it needed something more. I honestly hought a bit of salt would have done the trick, but she mentioned that some garlic would have been fabulous; it was quite a bit bland.   One of my cousins, my aunt and I got a bottle of sauvignon blanc, which was good, but coulda been a bit colder.  My other cousin got a pomegrante martini which she appeared to like, as she got another and remarked how strong the second one was. For dinner, we all got something different. I had wanted to get the grilled salmon, but they accidentally brought me the wrong dish, but it was still good.  It had salmon, shrimp, mashed potatoes, and a dill sauce on top.  A little heavier than I would like to eat, but nonetheless it was still good.  Two of my cousin got their combination vegetarian plates with which they got to choose what they wanted. They got some classic favorites like:  spinich pie, dolmas, falafel, coucous, potato pie, dill rice, etc.  My one cousin let me try all of hers and they were all delicious, but not the best I've ever had.  My aunt got lamb kabobs, which she said were perfect:  very tender and delicious.  Then my cousin who is not that into international cuisine got a stuffed chicken breast and from everything I could tell appeared to like it. For me the best part, despite my aunts remark that my stomach had expanded, was dessert.  Between the 5 of us we got 3 different desserts.  We had the classic baklava, which was very good.  This was the first time I had had it where I could tasted cinnamon and it was quite tasty.  We got a chocolate mousse which was really good even though I don't normally like my chocolate like that.  The best though had to be my choice, the chocolate peanut butter pie a la mode (that part we requested).  It honestly tasted like a gigantic Reese's Peanut Butter cup -- absolutely fabulous and I would have liked to have had that one all to myself. We sat out side despite there being five of us, on a very nice night.  Andersonville, in that area, can get very hectic, especially on a Saturday night.  The one thing that my aunt remarked on as to why she liked this place so much is that they always check up on you to make sure you're enjoying everything!  It was a great time, however, I think I liked it more because I was there with my cousins and aunt.",0.9995,0.707,0.238,0.055,0.5587811091514794

It's fresh and has a hint of a crunch to it, like it was grilled. Even leftover for a few days it's still good. +1 for the pita, because I could eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The hummus is good, but just a warning: it's a bit on the tangy side.  One of the best things about Andies is that they deliver and they're very fast. I've ordered out from here many times and I never had any complaints. And they're on GrubHub! Unfortunately there's a $20 minimum for delivery, so if you're eating alone tonight be prepared to have lots of leftovers, which is not necessarily a bad thing.

Additionally, I'm going to miss the warm weather, because the sidewalk seating is excellent.  Andersonville is a great place to have a great meal and people watch.

2007-06-30,3.0,"So there're a few non-raving reviews mixed in with the raves. Let me try to be balanced here. It was a toss-up between Reza's next door and Andies. And don't let the menus posted outside Andies deceive you. It isn't complete. According to our waiter, the takeout menu prices are slightly cheaper that the restaurant menu. That's a headscratcher to me. I didn't bother asking. Firstly, I'm glad there were 4 adults and a child in the group for us to try a few dishes. I shared an original mojito with a friend since I'm such a light drinker. It's so refreshingly fresh that I could easily down the entire drink had I not been feeling so unwell from the night before.  Our waiter, Jesse, was fabulously attentive, and not excessively so. He recommended the Moroccan eggplant and we enjoyed every healthy bit of it. It was cooked to the point of it falling apart but not mushy. Jesse was also paying attention to the generous pita basket and was replenishing it before the last slice was snatched off.  I would like to give it 4, based on my schwarma/gyro dish, and eggplant, alone. But I had to try the other dishes and get the assessment of them from my group. Here it goes: Avgalemono (chicken, lemon and rice soup): It's easy to like the soup. It's hearty. But I couldn't quite place the flavor of the broth -- it tastes like it comes out of a can, the husband begs to differ. It's salty, and it's the first dish out, so the table couldn't get enough of it. Greek salad: The dressing is nicely flavored but what I love the most is the long chunk of feta that comes with it. It's tempting to eat it by itself. Labanese steak gyros (Schwarma): Great flavor. The husband and I had a fabulous schwarma at a Wichita, KS mediterranean restaurant when we lived for a while, and had never since found any schwarma that rivals it. We got it here at Andies. But we disagree on the sauce that accompanies it. I prefer the yogurt sauce he had with his kabobs, and he likes the tahini that comes with this dish. Combination kabobs: The husband asks for medium and they are well-done. But the basmati rice is wonderfully fluffy and fragrant. Spinach with dill rice: The spinach is sauteed in olive oil, topped with feta. Unlike my companion, I'm not impressed with it even though I love spinach and feta.  Tunisian chicken and artichokes: Not my favorite but the rest of the table enjoys it. Is it good for children? My picky nephew devoured everything placed before him. I was stunned. Furthermore, his overexuberance got the attention of the manager who returned with a gift for him -- a portable radio cum flashlight. Will I return? Probably. But there are so many options along Clark Street. Prices for entrees start at $9. *Photos shot",0.997,0.801,0.162,0.037,0.5497076023391813

He, rife with attitude, asks, ""Is there a table out there??"" I told him yes, and he leads us back out to the sidewalk, tosses the menus onto the table and spins on his heel back into the restaurant without saying anything else. We waited about 10 minutes for the waiter to arrive, which was fine because they have a huge menu and it took a while to decide what to eat. Unfortunately, in that 10 minutes, I saw two other tables have to bring their check and credit card back into the restaurant so that they could leave. That should have been a sign of what was to come- I'll be more aware next time. The waiter was friendly but didn't have his A game by any stretch last night. He took our order, totally misunderstood what the girlfriend ordered (not sure how you can mistake ""basmati rice"" when she asked for ""greek salad""... she repeated herself and it was taken care of. It took, quite literally, 50 minutes for the food to arrive at the table. The busboy was phenomenal, never letting the water get lower than half a glass, and keeping us stocked with the amazingly delicious warm pita bread. Seriously, dump the waiter and/or host and hook this guy up. Only once in that 50 minutes did our waiter come back- he was checking because he thought he'd forgotten to take our drink order (which he had). Also during the wait, two guys sat down at the table behind ours and waited a good 15 minutes before our waiter stopped to ask if they'd been helped yet, to which they said no. He said he'd check for them, and a short time later, one of the other servers brought our waiter out with her and had to point out to him which tables were his responsibility- including the one in question. Funny, because he'd just finished serving that table 20 minutes earlier. Anyway, the food finally arrived, and it was fantastic. The girlfriend had the kabobs with greek salad; both were terrific. I had the stuffed chicken breast with basmati rice, which was also great. The busboy had to point out to our waiter that we were finished eating, at which point he came to take our plates and offer the check. 10 minutes later, the check arrived. While we were eating, a group of 6 had arrived and was sitting just inside the restaurant. Between taking their drink orders and bringing their appetizers, he pretty much put us on the back burner. Free tip from your Uncle Patrick: if you're a server, and someone is about to pay their bill and leave you a tip, THAT would be the ideal time to try to work more quickly, not less quickly. The slow service may have been almost passable if the host hadn't been such a jerk.

Got there right about noon and the place was almost completely empty.  We were seated promptly, ordered our coffee and drinks (I recommend the tequila sunrise over the bloody mary), and hit the buffet. Food:   Average, but with some Mediterranean offerings you don't typically see at a brunch.  I was suprised that it was so heavy on meats - a vegetarian dining companion decided not to have the buffet and ordered something from the menu instead.  I remember seeing bacon, sausage links, gyro meat, pepper steak, salmon, shrimp salad, and 2 chicken dishes.  Only 1 egg dish - a sliced spinach omelette that was just ok.  Very tasty little dessert pastry selection.  Generally, the food was nicely presented, warmed appropriately and replenished regularly. Music: A jazz trio started a little before 12:30 and provided a good background accompanyment to our conversation.  It wasn't so loud that we couldn't talk, but wasn't so good that we wanted to stop and just listen.  One problem is the speaker system... a music technician friend of mine pointed out that the ceiling-mounted speakers are almost parallel to the floor, making the optimum listening space about 9 feet in the air.  But, overall, it was very pleasant.  After a little over an hour, the band took a break and ate some brunch. Service: Initially very good but after our first coffee refill, our server disappeared for quite a while.  Maybe she had a 15-minute break that went a little long?  Needless to say, we were quite happy when she reappeared with carafes of coffee.  It would be nice if they added a self-serve coffee station to the buffet for patrons who want (need?) a 3rd cup of coffee.

First things first, they have great wine bottle specials, usually every week they pick three bottles of wine that are half price, this price can be as low as $12 for a bottle of wine, that's superb.  They also do make some nice drinks, their glogg has been nice to me this winter.   A couple of things that upset me about the restaurant: they try and do too much and really fall out of bounds with the mediterranean theme quite frequently, with bbq ribs and mojitos.  The pita bread has butter on it! GRR.  They even go out of their way to mention things that are vegan and then you can't have the pita, you can request it without butter, but really why even put butter on pita?  Their dishes tend to be quite quite large and somewhat flavorless, too much rice and too little of whatever it was that you wanted on top.  With all these negatives though, I do think it is a much better restaurant than reza's next door and that the food is smaller in portions sometimes to reza's which is nice.  So go here for their lunch and grab a bottle of wine if you come for dinner but don't expect spectacular food.",0.8686,0.872,0.083,0.045,0.4904761904761905
2006-12-17,3.0,"Interesting to have two Mediterranean spots right next door to each other (see review for Reza's below), but this one is trying to get into another niche.  Andies bills itself as the healthy Mediterranean restaurant which is evident on the menu which has a separate vegan listing and several vegetarian dishes.  But not to worry meat eaters the best dish I was able to try was the stuffed lamb, very flavorful!  However my chicken with artichokes was standard and the humus was a little bland (see ala turka and reza's for chicago's best).  I would get the stuffed eggplant if I am here again.  The menu might just have been a little too extensive.  It is as if they are trying to cover too much ground while not being really good at any one specialty. The service was moderate, the owner did come out and make sure we had a good time, their interior is a little hokey and a little bright.  And the server signing their name on the paper tablecloth, felt macaroni grillish and not appropriate for an independent in a city!  I did think the holiday offering of gloog was a nice touch.",0.9707,0.831,0.136,0.033,0.4720096371882086
2006-12-09,4.0,"Since I moved here, I've been unable to find a shwarma that comes close to the ones back home (Ottawa, Ontario).  Andie's comes the closest so far, and for that I'm thankfull. I went for the beef shwarma sandwhich, which is the best shwarma I've hand in Chicago so far.  My girlfriend got the shwarma platter on dill rice, which was even better than the sandwhich.  We also shared a decent hummous appetizer. The great thing about Andies is that they deliver.  There are few places besides pizza joints and Chinese that deliver these days, and even fewer that will make you a shwarma after lunch hour.  It also bears mentioning, the delivery guy was great.  When's the last time you met a delivery guy who acted like he had the best job in the world? Now, I've never eaten IN the restaraunt, but if you want something different for delivery, Andie's is definitely worth a shot.",0.9645,0.847,0.153,0.0,0.4422222222222221
2006-10-23,1.0,"Aw jesu, until I ate at Andie's, I never experienced food poisoning quite like this.  Grape leaves. It was the damn grape leaves. There were 14 of us in our party. Every one of us who had a stuffed grape leaf suffered terrible food poisoning. Fever plus the works. We called each other and figured it out.   The worst part: this was my friend's birthday party, and her mom paid for the entire thing. She was given a refund (I called and made the complaint) and a gift certificate to come back. But those of us who didn't get the gc don't much feel compelled to return.",0.4568,0.743,0.141,0.116,0.5375
2006-09-04,3.0,"I don't love this place as much as I once did, but I still like it well enough. Yeah, that's lukewarm, and I'm stickin' by it. Andies used to be a true hole-in-the-wall. It was about 1/4 of its current size, and it was the Little Engine That Could. The menu was limited, but the food kicked the ass of big bloated Reza's next door (which also used to be much smaller -- but that's for another review). The waiters were all older and ethnic, and knew what they were talking about. I'm happy that Andies is doing well enough to expand. I don't need time to stand still. The drawback, as other reviewers have mentioned, is that the menu and service have both suffered. I will say that I've never had bad service here. The place is big, so I can imagine that food might take a while to come out. But every server I've ever had has been competent at least. The owner (Andie himself) spends enough time in the restaurant to keep an eye on things. But there's much more turnover in wait staff these days, and the servers are no different from what you'd encounter at any mid-sized restaurant, so you can't count on them being knowledgeable. The menu has changed and gotten away from its roots. I still mourn the loss of my beloved spinach bulgur soup. And Andies is not the place I go for blackened salmon or seafood linguine. They still serve falafel, but it isn't very good -- it's usually pretty dry. And whatever became of the grilled octopus salad? But there are still some good traditional items on the menu. I've always been a fan of the kibbie, and the hummus and baba ganoush are both first rate. The braised lamb, the stuffed chicken breast, and the Moroccan eggplant are all good bets. I tend to order delivery from here more often than I eat in, and delivery is usually pretty quick. But I'm not that far away. The menu is indeed much more expensive than it was ""back in the day,"" especially when it comes to entrees. And Andies has always been more of a Mediterranean blend than strictly Middle Eastern. (Greek-Lebanese is how they used to describe themselves.) So be aware of that going in.",0.9251,0.815,0.107,0.078,0.5316550522648082
2006-08-27,4.0,"I actually really like Andie's.  I could be happy forever on a diet of their hummus.  And the rest of the food I've had there is pretty delish, from the gyros to the tabbouleh.  Every time I go to shop at Women and Children First, I make a stop at Andie's.  And I ordered it in last night, and it was fast and tasty.  I also thought that the quantities were rather large, for the price.

2006-08-07,3.0,"Went to Andies on Saturday night and thought it was ok.  I wouldn't say it was memorable.  I thought the food was pretty typical.  The service was a little slow.  We got to the restaurant around 8 so there was a little wait.  We waited about 20 minutes, so we headed to the bar.  The bartender was nice, but overwhelmed and definitely showed it.  However, she did go out of her way to make a special drink my boyfriend requested.  They had good, tasty drinks at the bar, but expensive and light on the alcohol.   We had stuffed lamb shank and filet mignon skewers.  Both were good.  My filet was ordered medium, but appeared a little more rare than I usually prefer.  Nevertheless, it was very good.  My boyfriend and I came to the conclusion that the service was slow because even though the restaurant started to clear a bit after 9, the number of waiters on the floor had also declined.  So everyone had a full load.   I don't think I am going to get cravings for Andies, especially when Chicago has so many restaurants to try.  However, I'd go back if I had a friend who wanted to have some mediterean food.",0.9858,0.836,0.164,0.0,0.5933904761904762
