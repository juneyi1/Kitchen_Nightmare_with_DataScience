The pasta was actually good and hearty. I liked it. Then again, this is an Italian place, anything less than good and hearty would have been a major fail.

What I was served was quite literally the smallest cup of soup I've ever seen in my 40 years of dining out. More on this later. Next I had order the rigatoni Bolognese, what I got resembled no Bolognese I've ever seen!  It was basically pasta, some tomato sauce, and a bunch of large chunks of meat with little flavor other than the Parmesan I liberally covered it with. Finally the piece-de-resistance, I got the check and saw that they charged me $5 for the soup! And to add insult to injury $5 for a small bottle of Pellegrino!  I went to the front and asked to talk to the Manager and was told he wasn't there.

The portions of food are pretty generous, so we skipped the appetizers (last time I ordered appetizers and did not touch my entrée) and went straight to the entrees.  I ordered the salmon and substituted the mashed potatoes which were delicious.  The best part of the salmon dish was the sauce--very tangy to help offset the fatty salmon.  Yum.  My boyfriend got baked penne and was very happy. The wine was fine.  It's served in a little juice glass.  My boyfriend is a beer drinker and unfortunately, no craft beer served here.   By the time we left, there was a large party in our area of the restaurant and I had to crawl over them to exit.  Like I said, it's a really small restaurant.

I provided my phone number and was told the manager would call me. I waited for a few hours and did not receive a call so I called them back. The person working had called and texted the manager to call me but I received no call. They recommended I called back the next day to try to get ahold of him but I should expect a call from him. I called Tuesday and got the same lip service and called back Wednesday and am finally able to speak with the manager. The manager says there may be a room rental fee. He said a party of 14 would take up a quarter of one of the rooms so I'm not very clear on why there would be a room rental fee. Anyhew, he would not specify if a room rental fee would actually be necessary and he would not specify what the price is for the room rental. He just kept saying the price would be ""minimal"". Seeing as how he is the manager and is also the only person apparently allowed to take larger reservations, he should have that information readily available.

My boyfriend and I risked showing up on a Saturday night with no reservation, and while we had to wait (about 30 mins) no one at any time made us feel forgotten. I sat at the bar and had a glass of wine while we waited and it was very pleasant. The bartender was very nice and chatted with us. You should absolutely make a reservation though. When we were seated, our waiter Mike B. came up right away and was incredibly kind, apologized for the wait and everything. He advised us on the specials and we ordered the Lasagna (with meat sauce) and the Shrimp and Scallop ravioli (the daily special ravioli), as well as the meatballs to start and tiramisu and sorbet to finish. Meatballs were amazing! Juicy and cooked perfectly, and you could tell they were fresh and mostly meat vs. mostly filler. The ravioli was incredible and I'm jealous my boyfriend ate it all. It had big chunks of tender scallops, whole shrimp and a light sauce that didn't make me feel like I was eating a stick of butter. My lasagna came without meat sauce at first and I wasn't a huge fan - very mushroom-y (and I love mushrooms, but the flavors were imbalanced) and the regular marinara was meh. The noodles were housemade but too thick. With the meat sauce though, the lasagna goes from 3 to 4 stars, because that sauce is amazing. The tiramisu was great, nothing mind blowing but very good, and the sorbet was actually delicious. It was black raspberry and it tasted fresh and light and not too sweet.  Service in general was a little slow since we came at prime time on a Saturday night, but our waiter himself was very attentive and kind, didn't charge me for the forgotten meat sauce and all the staff made the 2 1/2 hour long experience very pleasant.

I was more than embarrassed that I suggested this place by the time we got out of there. I do have to say that honestly the food is great. Kudos. She enjoyed it as much. Although our mother did not. We did not get seated immediately despite there being only a few tables occupied. Instead an older guy pointed to the back and said ""wait over there"", so we did, slightly confused. When we were eventually seated, we all ordered Cokes (None of us are drinkers really). The Coke was disgusting. Tasted like it came from a bottle that had been opened a week before. I called the waiter over and mentioned that the soda was just awful and his reply was ""oh yeah the coke here is not good. Terrible really"" and just looked blankly at me. I thought at first maybe he was pulling my leg, trying to make the most out of the situation. But nope. Just continued to stare until I asked ""Well could we get different drinks?"" It was from this moment, we might as well have been invisible to the man. He managed to bring us ginger ale in bottles adding that ""it's hard to mess this up"". He took our order eventually and continued very lively conversation with the other groups around us. I got the feeling because we were not ordering wine or cocktails, we were deemed unimportant. Towards the end of our meal, we noticed a nauseating paint odor and see the first older gentleman going around our table painting over chips in the paint on the walls and the booth we were in. I was more stunned than anything, and with a headache quickly developing I asked what he was doing, pointing out that we're right here and the smell is awful. He commented that he too thought it smelled and went back to painting. This was by far the strangest part of the night. I couldn't believe it. Well, gee do you think it's the best idea to do this while you have patrons in your restaurant? It seems like common sense to me that if you need to do that, do it after you're closed and you won't make your customers sick and nauseated. The final straw was our waiter walking by, literally flopping dessert menus in front of us, without saying a word and walking away. Then he came back to see the menus stacked together, and said with an attitude ""so no dessert then?"".....you're right...why not spend more money and time in a place that has welcomed us so graciously.

The server, host, and bus boys were pretty quick considering the amount of people in the restaurant. They were nice and attentive.  The food was good. It was good portion. I had the salmon egg Benedict. The salmon was good. Nothing to complain about. The potatoes were good. It's a great place for brunch.

I called a few times for reservations and find out more information and no one ever picked up any of my phone calls or called back after making a reservation over voicemail.

Although what I did experience was that I had made a reservation and then was told we had to wait well over an hour for our table and service was not good and food was meh.  Last nite I returned for dinner. I had purchased a Groupon and hey it's PRIDE so why not whoop it up. I have to say I was pleasantly surprise what a quiet retreat is was during the first weekend of pride yeah now they drag it out over 2 weeks. Although parking was HORRIBLE. Yeah I should know better. Be sure to check the Cubs schedule too because that really make a difference for parking. Anywho the service was friendly and adequate. The salads caprese and pear walnut Gorgonzola were both fresh and tasty. The gnocchi I had was good but slightly over cooked leaving them overly pillowy. The scallop and shrimp scampi was more pallenta than its named entree. And the seafood although good were not overly fresh and plump but were certainly good enough. The wine list is adequate mainly basic low end wines which are all featured by the glass. I recommend a bottle as they have tiny Spanish style water glasses. And unfortunate even if u order a bottle they don't have real wine glasses unless you ask and then bring u cheap tiny tea cup stemmed glasses ...BOOO!

The portions are gigantic and the service was super attentive. My coffee cup was never empty and neither was my water glass, so that was great. Now the less than great- it was SUPER loud inside- both conversation-wise as well as the music. I'm all for a festive Sunday brunch, but I felt slightly deaf upon leaving. Also not ideal was the waiting area- the Sunday brunch is not a secret, so everyone was packed like sardines in the very small bar area and it was quite hot inside. The other small-ish gripe was that Sunday brunch is cash-only. Totally their prerogative to be cash-only, but I don't know many people that carry cash.

2015-12-05,3.0,"Complicated experience. Our primary  server was pleasant and appeared competent, but one of his associates was overly aggressive (one of my companions - we were 6 - thought him rude). The decor is pretty and the atmosphere loud. It's a small place yet we had to speak loudly to hear ourselves over both the other diners and the music from the speakers. The two under servers working our table had to shout to each other while holding - and ultimately passing - one dish over our heads. It was somewhat surreal.  The food - when we finally got it - was, for the most part, quite good. We waited too long for appetizers and there was confusion about those. Too many of one appetizer was brought, others didn't make an appearance until the entree was served - and only then after a reminder - and one appetizer we didn't order was placed on our table until we asked them to take it away.  Skip the calamari - 3/4 of the appetizer remained on the plate before being removed; try the cheesy meatballs and garlic sautéed Brussels sprouts instead. The Caesar salad with fresh anchovies was a hit as were the 4-cheese gnocchi, eggplant Parmesan, and - to a lessor degree, tho still tasty - the linguini w clams.  The prices are reasonable with one exception: $10/shot for Bailey's is excessive. Wine was a far more acceptable $6-8/ glass.  I might return on a less busy weeknight, but there are so many better places to go for Italian fare, it's not a certainty; I'm far more likely to order take-out from there than attempt another meal in the restaurant.",0.9557,0.891,0.084,0.025,0.6651515151515153

The food potion of the menu is a little limited, but we were both able to find good lunch side options. I had a surprisingly good turkey club with impressive pesto mayo included. Chips were a nice change from fries. Bottomless mimosas. I just couldn't get over it. So exciting! Be advised that it's cash only and will be about $22 per person for brunch menu item + mimosas.

2015-11-25,2.0,"I've gone to this place several times for brunch. The first time was actually really nice - food was decent and the bottomless mimosas were fantastic. The experience was good enough that I decided to have a larger group of my friends all meet there for brunch. I had a reservation several weeks in advance and were told upon arrival that it would be a few minutes as the party before us was not done yet. We were told to wait outside and we did. After 10 minutes I went back to check on the status of our table and was told to go to the bar next door to wait and we would be called in. Ok... so we went to the bar next door. FORTY-FIVE minutes later our table STILL wasn't ready and we actually got kicked out of the bar next door - not because we were drinking - on the contrary, because we weren't drinking enough! Mind you there was nobody else in the bar so we weren't taking up valuable real estate or anything. So after over an hour I said screw it and we went to Revolucion down the street - no wait there. So I was pretty peeved after that experience. Nevertheless, my friends and I decided to try it ONE MORE TIME. This time without a reservation, just to see. This place is small, cramped, and stuffy, not to mention loud. I tried to flag down anyone just to see what the wait time was. Nobody paid me the time of day. Finally I got the attention of the manager who is always working there. I was not even able to get a word out of my mouth and he just put his finger right up to my face and said ""wait a minute"". WTF!? I know you're busy but I wasn't being rude or disrespectful - on the contrary, I was being very patient quiet just trying to give you my business! Horrendous service.  In short, this place is basically just a glorified gutter of people who want a boozy brunch in Boystown and nothing more. With so many better options a short walk or cab ride away I am completely perplexed why anyone would endure the cramped, loud quarters, awful service, and ok food. Never again, and I hope nobody else wastes their time going to this place.",0.9401,0.866,0.088,0.046,0.4404850088183423

The Short Ribs were the ultimate comfort food. I already can't wait to go back in the winter and tuck into this dish!

For $21, I received bottomless champagne (AKA any variation of mimosas, bellinis, and kir royales!) and a brunch entree. Honestly, I wouldn't have been surprised if this combo cost $40+ anywhere else, so you're really getting an amazing deal on all of these delicious options.

Upon walking in, we noticed it looked a bit fancier than we originally thought it was. We weren't dressed for the occasion and didn't have a reservation, but they took us in anyway. When we walked in, the restaurant looked very small, but there were two sides to the place--two different rooms. We were seated in the second room. The ambiance was just perfect: dim lighting, small and intimate tables, empty wine bottles lining the walls behind the tables, classic oldies music playing - Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, etc. Our server was very attentive and kind. When we weren't sure which kind of wine to order, he made a suggestion for us and let us taste a small amount before giving us our glasses.  Now for the food...everything was superb! I ordered the Fusilli con Pollo: roasted chicken, baby spinach and a vodka tomato cream sauce. My friend ordered the Baked Penne with bolognese sauce. The wait time was average, but when our food came out, I was in awe of how beautiful everything looked - not to mention the huge portion sizes! The vodka sauce in my meal just gave the dish such a unique taste. The chicken was what made it all the more filling, too! I ate to my hearts content and STILL had leftovers. We shared a tiramisu for dessert. Their tiramisu had more of a cinnamon taste than a coffee taste, but it was still very sweet, which I loved. We had a wonderful experience here and I wouldn't change a thing. I've found my new favorite Italian restaurant!",0.9969,0.774,0.212,0.014,0.6275425685425685

We had a blast and would definitely go back.  Only down side was that we could tell our waiter wanted us to leave, and we felt a little burdensome towards the end because he dropped our check without asking if we wanted any dessert or more mimosas.

2014-11-02,1.0,"I expected Angelina to be a very good restaurant based on its warm decoration and because it is quite crowded almost every day. However our dinner was very very disappointing.  My summary in few words is: if you like Italian food, don't come here.  I'm Spaniard and I've been to Italy quite a few times. I also have several italian friends who love cooking and are great cooks. So I've tried lots of pasta dishes, which most of the time turned out to be an amazing combination of a few ingredients. I want to make this clear, because my first complain is the menu. It has few dishes -I don't mean this as a criticism- and they are all far from italian, both in terms of the recipes themselves and execution. I tried three dishes: a salad, which was decent but pricey, overall because it was a very small portion, and two pasta dishes. The pasta dishes were kind of pretentious and both came with a lot of cooked basil. This was the first disappointment. If you add basil to your sauce you want to do it at the end, so you don't (over)cook the leaves and ruin them like they were in Angelina. The ""Ricotta Cheese Gnocchi"" were literally swimming in some type of tasteless, liquidy, tomato-colored soup, which I guess was the sauce. As to the gnocchi themselves, they weren't bad but nothing spectacular. I also had some ravioli that were overcooked, and with a pretty tasteless filling -some of them were empty and the filling was floating in the sauce. The sauce itself wasn't too bad but anything to remember either. And definitely nothing you can't do at home in a few minutes. I can't say anything about the dessert, because based on the first three dishes we decided not to try any.  To be fair I must say that the wines we tried were pretty good (french and italian) and the olive oil (with touches of rosemary) and bread that they gave us as antipasti were pretty good. These two things were the best of our dinner. A part of me feels like going to Angelina one more time. I ask myself if the chef had the worst night of his life, if he was sick or something like. If I do so, I'll update the review. But to be honest, and based on our disappointment, I don't feel like doing that anytime in the near future.",0.9917,0.763,0.168,0.07,0.5156341575091574

If he asked us that he would've known we were celebrating our 5 year anniversary and we felt uncomfortable mentioning it as the tables were extremely close together and didnt want to impose that on diners next to us. He only checked on us once and made it seem like we were a burden just taking up his table probably assuming we wouldn't tip well because we're young. I've worked in the service industry for the past 7 years and know how it goes, I always tip above 20% because I know even if you give amazing service there are people out there who will still stiff you on a good tip.

Parking is available - free in some spots on Addison if you are lucky, or pay-and-display on Broadway.  My one small quibble is the glasses in which wine is served.  They use the traditional bistro-style glasses, but it takes something away from the experience for me, so I no longer order wine with the meal there.",0.9781,0.768,0.178,0.054,0.6333333333333334

2014-06-26,5.0,"I tend to visit Chicago often and usually stay downtown, however I have started to discover that some of the best places are located away from the core business district. While I am a die-hard Cardinals fan I love Wrigleyvile and the surrounding community, one trip I decided to venture down Addison towards the lake and discovered Angelina Ristorante, which is an intimate Italian restaurant serving up some amazing food.  I have already dined here several times, and have never been disappointed. The entree prices are moderate, starting at $14 for Pasta Pomodoro and maxes out at $24 for the Short Ribs. My dish of choice would have to be the Garganelli Piselli & Pancetta, which is hand rolled penne, crispy pancetta, peas, and parmesan cream. This dish is pure heaven, and I swear that they are in the back rolling the pasta themselves, this is not something out of a box, the pasta here is prepared with love and it shows. I have also tried the Ravioli which is equally as good however Garagenelli piselli & Pancetta has won me over. Seating here is more intimate, with a mood to match. Service here has always been top notch, with a friendly staff who ensure you will enjoy your experience. On my most recent visit our waiter recommended the Chocolate Bread Pudding, which I couldn't resist. It was simply amazing, luckily it was shared with the table otherwise I could had probably eaten the entire thing myself without any guilt. Overall I highly recommend Angelina Ristorante, as it has quickly become one of my go to spots when visiting Chicago.",0.9957,0.783,0.213,0.004,0.45645593869731793
2014-06-09,3.0,"This restaurant definitely has a romantic vibe and has a nice ambiance :) Low lighting, nice rustic italian decor, and white tablecloth tables with white paper on top so you know it's not TOO fancy, lol.  We had reservations for 2 on Sunday at 5:30pm and the place wasn't too crowded though it definitely filled up as the evening progressed into ""prime dinner time"". I was a little caught off guard that there was no host/hostess..wasn't sure if that's the norm or it was understaffed that night. But I was seated on time with my date right away. We were prompty given cold glasses of water and bread. While the bread was a little crusty on the outside, the olive oil dip at the table was so delicious! Make sure you ask your server to grate some fresh parmesan for you! It was delicious!! We decided to get 3 dishes for dinner - Calamari Siciliana as an appetizer and shared the Rigatoni Napoli pasta dish and Braised Beef Short Ribs. All 3 dishes were very delicious and we asked our waiter to bring it to us one at a time so that our table wasn't overwhelmed with too much food. The calamari was probably my favorite because they cooked the calamari perfect, the flavor of all the ingredients together was perfect, and the fresh tomato sauce was so good! I was dipping my bread and the sauce and probably could've wiped the plate clean because I liked it so much! Next came our pasta dish which our server kindly helped split into 2 plates for us.   It was a very tasty chicken pasta dish with marsala cream sauce, onions, and mushrooms. It's a very typical dish I've had in other places before and this one was not exceptional but it was good. Our last dish took forever to come - almost 30 minutes after our pasta dish arrived. I have an inkling the server forgot to put it in or something because he came at about the 20 minute mark and asked ""so are we just waiting for our last dish...the duck?"" And of course we said no and reminded him it was the short rib. Around this time is when the restaurant got filled with diners since it was prime dinner time and we didn't see our waiter that much - he looked like he had been running around so I'm thinking they were short staffed. When the dish finally did come, it was again split on two plates for us and was a good amount of food! It had a really nice flavor gravy and the mashed potatoes and short ribs were delicious! Short ribs weren't fall off my fork but tender and flavors were perfect. While we were waiting for our food the restaurant also got super smokey, so much that my eyes started hurting and watering. It turns out that their air system was not working and the temperature in that place got up to 79F despite being set at 68F. Needless to say, I just wanted the rest of my food and get out of there. They tried to do their best of the situation by opening out the front door to let some air in but the smoke from the kitchen was somehow not getting picked up by the kitchen exhaust fans and was continually creeping into the main dining room. So much for the romantic atmosphere :( Not sure if I would come again based on this first experience...food was good but not so good it's worth all of the other things that weren't so great about this experience.",0.9969,0.807,0.148,0.045,0.5885154061624651

2014-04-28,1.0,"I am so bummed out to say this, but I had an extremely upsetting experience at Angelina's yesterday and will never frequent this place again. This restaurant really needs to polish up their act, and learn to MAKE ALL PEOPLE FEEL EQUALLY WELCOME, GAY OR STRAIGHT (not just gay).  I used to live nearby and would go to the restaurant nearly once a week because their food was so amazing and ambience quaint. Yesterday, I wanted to bring my boyfriend to their well-known Sunday brunch. When we got there, we put our names on the list, were told the wait wouldn't be long, and that we could wait at the bar. The bartender never acknowledged us even though there are only 4 seats at the tiny bar. About 5-10 minutes later, we asked the bartender if we could just eat our meal at the bar, to which he responded No and proceeded to bitch about his fellow coworkers slacking off and why isn't so and so doing his ""f$&$%* job"". Still no offer for a drink. His friend was sitting in the corner seat at the bar (with a drink in hand) and they just chatted away.  A few minutes later, we noticed tables opening up, and we were next In line! I was pumped to get a table and eat! But then, the owner sat a gay couple that had clearly arrived after us and added their names to the wait list after us. It caught me off guard because I've never seen something like that blatantly happen-- the manager glanced at my boyfriend and me, and then at the other couple, and then proceeded to seat them first.  I asked my boyfriend if he had noticed what had just happened and he did, so I figured okay maybe if the manager/owner guy seats us in the next second, it would just be a matter of two tables opening up at the exact same time. Or maybe it was a simple mistake? Unfortunately, that was not the case. A couple of minutes later, we still had not been seated and I asked my boyfriend if we could leave. After the situation sank in a bit, I really felt like discrimination or an odd form of favoritism had taken precedence to common restaurant service decency. We were clearly unwelcome in their restaurant.  We got up to walk out, and the same owner/manager man yelled to us ""hey we are clearing off a table for you now in the other room"" (why in the other room? There were open tables in the main room) to which I replied ""sorry we are leaving. You seated that other couple minutes ago and you knew we came in before them. That's kind of rude."" To which he loudly replied ""WELL SO WHAT?"" So it hadn't been an honest mistake, it had been a blatant act. As we left the restaurant, he followed us out, and made a bit of scene out of the situation, saying ""are you seriously leaving because of that!?! Come on I'll buy you guys a round of drinks."" Which clearly shows that he really didn't understand how upsetting his actions had been. I really hope it wasn't discrimination but that's sure what it felt like.",-0.6124,0.828,0.08,0.092,0.4345163222521713

Angelina's menu changes seasonally, so you always have something new and fresh to select.  I believe they keep a few of their classics on-hand year round, too.  They keep both standard fare and twists on old standbys available.  Their dishes are always flavorful but not overpowering.  I've never ordered anything here that I did not thoroughly enjoy; it is by far the best Italian food in the area.     This time around my girlfriend and I ordered the caprese salad, gnocchi and the rigatoni with a veal bolognese.  The gnocchi is handmade and is pasta-based rather than potato, with a light cheese filling.  My bolognese was not heavy, which I found refreshing, and the veal was tender and juicy.  I find the portion sizes and the prices to always be appropriate, as well.   I love this place and highly recommend it!",0.9851,0.819,0.153,0.028,0.5256739811912226

2014-02-08,5.0,"Love this place. I would give it a 4.5 because the service can be hit or miss, but the food is so good that I'll round up to 5. Haven't tried the brunch because it's typically crowded, and my loathing for waiting/crowds is greater than my love for bottomless anything-alcohol. The appetizers are good but nothing special. I would recommend saving yourself for your entree. The menu is small, which I like because you aren't overwhelmed with options. I HIGHLY recommend the gnocchi- it's not potato-based so it has a wonderful, light texture and doesn't leave you feeling like you have a wet sack of flour in your stomach. The garganelli piselli is awesome (though doesn't reheat well) and the meatloaf italiano is yummy if you want something carnivorous.  My only complaint is the service is hit or miss. It's usually great, but when it's bad, it's bad. Last time I was in, the host sat us at a 4-top, asked us to move to make room for a bigger party (we declined because our appetizer has just come and we were comfortable), came back 5 minutes later and demanded we move to a table near the door, then asked us to move again a couple minutes later. Our server threw us a free dessert for our troubles, but the host was a dick and the manager (older guy with long grey hair, usually posted up by the bar) saw it all go down and didn't come over to apologize or thank us for not throwing a hissy fit about the whole situation. However, the time before, I had the friendliest, funniest, most adorable waiter who made great recommendations, hooked us up with a free glass of wine, and subsequently got the biggest tip I've left to date. Also, as a side note, I was the other patron referenced in the extremely negative review dated 9/5/13. I gasped because the customer/reviewer was indeed being as asshole, and I couldn't believe what a scene he was making or how horribly he was berating the poor server for something that wasn't his fault.

Bruschetta--a variety of 3 different types. All were delicious--especially the black olive tapenade. Caesar salad--typical Italian caesar salad. Garganelli Piselli & Pancetta--delicious!!! Thick, flavorful parmesan cream sauce. The pancetta had a lot of flavor and was not rubbery like some I have had at other restaurants. Pollo Angelina--This is supposed to be a half roasted Amish chicken with sausage and peppers. As we split this dish, they gave us one plate with the breast of an Amish chicken (delicious) and one plate with a fatty chicken breast. Had I known this plate would be split like this, we would have split it ourselves to save us from the really awful chicken breast we were given.  Brunch- 2 stars.     We walked in and were sat right away. There were maybe 4 other tables on our half of the restaurant. We could see two bussers, two servers, and a bartender, yet no one came up to us to give us water for 5 to 10 minutes. Frustrating as everyone made eye contact with us.

Angelinas has a nice decor, friendly staff, and a hopping and fun gay vibe.  The only significant downside was the music which was both LOUD and erratic.  Meaning, it bounced from country, to ambient music, to pop, and even a few random sound effects like what seemed like gunshots.  Perhaps this is done on purpose, to help drown out the tipsy mimosa drinkers whom I'm sure tend to get quite loud themselves after a number of drinks?  Nonetheless, it subtracted a bit from an otherwise good experience.",0.9643,0.734,0.223,0.043,0.5508169934640523

2013-09-05,1.0,"First let me just say that Angelina's WAS once our favorite restaurant in the neighborhood.  We frequently patronized the establishment with many friends and family.  Then we went there last night to celebrate a friend's birthday. After a great meal, wine and even a Tiramisu birthday slice complete with candle, we asked for the check (our server was also one of our favorites). When he returned with the check, he tells us that the credit card system is not working and we would have to pay cash. WHAT??? CASH??? Who walks around today with over $200 in cash in their pocket...certainly we don't! At first we thought it was a joke, then he hurried away and the ""manager"" came over. (Now if you have ever been there, you've seen this manager who walks around with a cigarette behind his ear, long grey greasy hair and dirty t-shirt.) So he begins to tell us the same story about the credit card system at which time, we tell him that we should have been told this BEFORE we sat down. Then he tells us that there was a sign on the front door, explaining this. There was no sign when we walked in, but of course he denies this and continues to insist that we just didn't pay attention. We then tell him....why didn't the ""disappearing"" waiter tell us it was CASH ONLY? No answer for that, so he walks away. We called him back over from the bar to further discuss it...at which time he asks what he can do to ""better"" the situation. I tell him how ridiculous this all is at which time...and yes no exaggeration...he calls me an ""asshole"". A woman at the next table gasped when she heard him. Mortified, we proceeded to leave after gathering as much cash together as possible and gave it to him...at which time he stumbles and drops it on the floor (maybe the bar isn't the best place for this manager to hang out.)

2013-06-18,3.0,"I am torn while writing this review, while we have had previously good experiences here this last time was a bust. We came here with a Groupon and were pleasantly suprised that the restaurant was not packed yet at about 5:30pm on a Monday night, we were seated on the other side of the restaurant away from the main door and with only one other couple there it was very quiet and intimate (for the moment, I'll get to that later) The waiter was very friendly and took our order fairly quickly. I ordered the Pear Gorgonzola salad and the Short Ribs. Hubby ordered the Beef Carpaccio(sp?) and the Spicy Sausage dish. I also ordered a glass of Riesling that was not good at all, kinda bitter and dry but I know these can vary so I did not complain.  The salad was good, not exciting but good, hubby liked his Carpaccio. Prior to getting our meals though and huge group of moms and daughters were seated in the room with us. It felt like someone was leaning on the remote control as the volume went from 3 to 50 in the span of 30 seconds. I am not one of  those people who thinks children should not be in restaurants better than Chuck E. Cheese, however, I do believe that if you bring your kids to a nice restaurant then they should act the part. These kids were loud and obnoxious and to make matters worse the moms sat at one table and the kids at another? Picture that 12 adolescent girls at a table without supervision?! Only 1 mom even bothered to attempt to quiet them the rest simply ignored them. Major bummer even more so because no one at the restaurant seemed to care either. No attempts to quiet the group or at the very least compensate the rest of the patrons that had to endure the onslaught! Dinner finally came after what seemed like hours because of the torture across the aisle from us but was likely only 20-30 mins after we finished our apps but was still a bit too long. My short ribs were good, I subbed mashed potatoes for the pasta and they were good. Nothing great but good. Same for hubby's sausage he said it was good just sweeter than he would have liked.  We tried the bread pudding for dessert at the waiter's recommendation, it was pretty good, the ice cream was the best part. We waited quite some time for the bill and then a while for the waiter to bring it back for us to sign. The price was to me, way too high for what we got, even after a $40 groupon with tip our bill was $80, that is crazy for 1 salad, 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 dessert and 1 glass of bitter wine! Don't think we will make any special trips to come here again, there are just better options around.",0.9947,0.762,0.163,0.074,0.5623679653679655

Everything about this restaurant is just ""fine"".  I had no complaints about my meal, the service, or the dinner check, but nothing stood out to me either.  The food tasted like something your mother (meaning an American mother, not a first generation Italian mother) might be able to make at home if you gave her a couple shots at it, the beer list was underwhelming, and a fair amount of noise from Broadway traffic drifted through the restaurant here and there.  The portions were nice but I was hoping for a more extensive menu, or at least more unique takes on the dishes they did offer.

2013-03-01,2.0,"The worst Italian and the worst service I've yet to experience in Chicago. Maybe the worst Italian ever - yes, the dreaded Olive Garden is better. Holy crap. This place was a joke. Terrible service, blah food, and beyond overpriced. (For details, read on.) First of all, we had reservations for 4, and when we arrived at 7:20 on a Wednesday night they sat us in the empty, cold dining room by the entrance at a super tiny table that had a weird side bench. After sitting there for 10 minutes and not a single employee walking into that side of the restaurant, a busboy finally came by with some waters and we asked to be moved to the other dining room where it was warmer. Finally, after at least another 5 minutes, our server came by and told us that we could move. This was not off to a good start, but I was hungry, so I sucked it up. We moved over to the other dining room and informed our server that we had a Groupon for our dinner. The restaurant had a $20 for $40 value (2 people) Groupon and a $40 for $80 value (4 people), however, we had technical difficulties purchasing the $40 for $80 good for four people, so Groupon customer service suggested we just get 2 of the $20 for $40 ones since it worked out the same. Fine. I informed our server of this and he was very confused and said that it wasn't allowed, so I asked to speak to the manager. He came over (in his kitchen apron?), and we explained the situation to him. It took over 5 minutes to finally make him understand that we were NOT trying to use an $80 value PLUS a $40 value, just two $40 values for 4 people, which was the SAME THING as the $80 value. Ladies and gentlemen, this guy runs a restaurant and can't do simply math. Whatever. Anyway, when he finally realized it, he apologized for the confusion (you think?) and said it would be no problem! Phew. A long, frustrating conversation for ""no problem."" Yikes. After that, the server took our drink order and came back with it about 30 minutes later to take our order. So, at this point we've been here about 50 minutes and haven't even had a chance to order! Hubs and I shared the Caprese salad - I was *super* disappointed because the server described the salad as having Buffala Mozzarella, but it was just regular fresh Mozz - huge difference in quality AND price. If I had known I was getting 4 tiny slices of fresh Mozz and 4 slices of tomato, I would have made it with those exact ingredients that I already have in my fridge, not paid $10 for it. TEN DOLLARS. That's more than Spiaggia or Prosecco charge for the same salad, but larger at their restaurants. Our friends had the calamari, which was boiled not fried, and they said it was soggy, fishy, and chewy, served in a fairly runny marinara sauce. Finally, at last, dinner! I ordered mushroom risotto, hubs had the duck, and our friends had the spaghetti and meatballs special and the shrimp scampi. Reports from others: Duck - good, good size, but not the best duck he's ever had. A little chewy. Shrimp Scampi - tails still on shrimp, didn't like the polenta (which I did enjoy, btw) Spagh & Meatballs - decent Now, the risotto was honest to God the absolute worst risotto I've ever tasted. The stuff in a box from Target is MUCH better. That's pathetic. I absolutely love risotto, I make an awesome one myself, but this one was unbearable. It was flavorless, covered in goat cheese (on risotto? bad idea), and just so awfully blah I didn't want to eat it. In fact, I ate more of my husband's side of polenta than I did the risotto. KILL ME. Alright, so once dinner is over it takes another 20 minutes to get our plates cleared, and when he finally comes to offer us dessert, it's 9:15 and we have a movie to catch, so we have to pass. It then takes him another 15 minutes to bring us our check and once we give him the Groupons, he wants to TAKE our phones to punch in the codes. No way, holmes, you're writing down the code, 'cause I have a you break, I break you rule. ANOTHER 15 minutes passes and he comes back with the credit card receipts for us to sign. Ladies and gentlemen, I kid you not, dinner for four with ONLY appetizers and entrees took from 7:20 until 9:45. For those of you not good at counting, that's TWO HOURS and TWENTY FIVE MINUTES. Ridiculous. Now, about the prices. Our bill was $75 before we deducted the Groupon. Crazy - $19 for worst risotto ever, $23 for ""just ok"" duck, $10 for the lamest Caprese salad, and $20 for drinks - 1 glass of wine and 2 beers. You've got to be kidding me, Angelina.  I will never, ever, ever be back. Even though their Sunday all-you-can-drink champagne Brunch *sounds* amazing, I have no doubt it will be just as mediocre as dinner. (And btw, it's misleading to say bottomless champagne when there's no way it's actually champagne for $21 - call it what it is, sparkling wine or cheap Prosecco, ugh.) Sorry I'm not sorry, Angelina.

2013-02-26,3.0,"This place is my go-to Italian restaurant in the neighborhood - not because it's necessarily particularly good but because it's decent and really close by. The service is usually quite good too (although I have noticed kitchen snafus happen to other tables.) The food tends to be over buttery and over salted -- and I am not always sure what's particularly ""Italian"" about some of the dishes - unless the presence of pasta automatically makes a dish ""Italian"". Some of them just seem to be solid non-specific dishes without any particular Italian flare. But if you are hungry and want decent food, I suppose it's not bad. However, I did notice that some of their menu staple items have shrunk in size. For example, I used to like the beef carpaccio and would order it occasionally until they shrunk the portion dramatically. I think they did that with the mussels too. The wine glasses are small .... if you can call them wine glasses. They look like juice cups. And please stop over-pricing your wine! I know restaurants do that but it seems especially bad at Angelina. Anyway, 3 stars because food has been decent and the service good. Most importantly, convenient location.

2013-02-15,4.0,"My boyfriend and I live in Lakeview and had passed by Angelina Ristorante on a few occasions. We thought it looked charming and liked that it was close to home, so we decided to take a chance on it for Valentine's Day. Our reservation was at 7:00, so we got in without a wait, but it looked like 8:00ers were crowded into the bar area. To say that Angelina is cozy is a bit of an understatement. The host originally tried to seat us at a table that seemed to share elbow room with the two adjacent tables. Fortunately, he moved us against the wall, where there was a bit more space and which felt more private. However, it's a testament to Angelina's romantic decor and lighting that such a small, crowded restaurant can indeed be great for something like Valentine's Day. You will almost certainly be up close and personal with your fellow diners, even if you thought you were only going to be intimate with your date. That said, I greatly enjoyed the ambiance, and the service and food were top notch. To start, they brought out a bread basket, which was warm and soft, and we ate it with the table oil.  We split an appetizer off of the special Valentine's Day menu: three jumbo shrimp and three oysters on the half shell for $14. We thought it was a bit amusing to serve three for Valentine's Day, but we had no problem choosing which of each we wanted more of. For our entrees, my boyfriend had veal marsala off their regular menu and I had a lobster and scallop ravioli off the Valentine's menu. I sampled his veal, which was a little dry for me, but the baby spinach that accompanied it was divine. He enjoyed both, though. I ordinarily don't order ravioli, because I think the serving sizes are a bit small, but I am so glad I did this time.  This dish was fabulous. The ravioli was stuffed with lobster, and bite-sized scallops and chopped asparagus peppered the rest of the dish. Our server was all smiles and lingered long enough to be helpful. He was also exceptionally prompt with drinks, additional menus, and the check. All in all, it was a very enjoyable meal. I'd recommend Angelina for a romantic special occasion.",0.9976,0.789,0.196,0.015,0.5878218864468864

My husband had the veal marsala which came with spinach. The spinach was cooked perfectly, the veal was decent but not the best he's ever had. The portion was generous.  The wine list is OK, nothing special.  We had the chocolate hazelnut creme brulee for dessert. It tasted more like the consistancy of a pot de creme, but the flavor was true to word.

Not only was this the best risotto, I ever had, golden beets, with asparagus. Italian sausage, goat cheese and topped with freshly grated parmesan cheese. The half order not only sufficed I still had enough to take home with me. I am one that puts a lot of weight in service at a dining establishment, so when a server goes out of his way to do recommendations that suits the patron and not concerned about the final tally in reference to his tip, says a lot to me about the caliber about the establishment.

2012-03-27,1.0,"Let me preface this by saying that I used to LOVE Angelina. I had a great first date here, I had my anniversary dinner here (with a different person...awkward...), and it was one of my go-to local Italian places. I also recommended its ""drunk brunch"" to everyone I knew. That, friends, will no longer be possible. I'd gone to brunch at Angelina at least three times before, and there was always a massive (worth it!) wait. The day after St. Patrick's, my visiting friend from out of town wanted to meet up with some of our local friends and continue the drinking fest. Around noon, I finished teaching Sunday school. I live right across the street from Angelina, and as I passed, I saw the usual long line. When I got home and finished changing, I called the restaurant. Here's the gist of the conversation: Host: Angelina! Me: Hi! Can you tell me about how long your wait is right now? Host: Yep, it's about an hour. Would you like me to put your name down? Me: Wait, you guys do that? Host: Yep! We don't take reservations, but I can put your name down now. Me: Great! Yeah, it's Meggie, for six. Host: Maggie? Me: Meggie. With an E. So you'll put my name down, and then I'll make sure to be there before you call our party in an hour? Host: Sure thing. I show up about 45 minutes later with three friends (two bailed). I see the host and flag him down. Here's our conversation: Me: Hi, I called and put my name down-- it's Meggie. About how much longer for our table? Host: Oh, hi. I took your name down. Yeah, it'll be about an hour. Me: ... Host: So you can wait out here. Me: Wait, I don't understand. I called to put my name down about an hour ago, and you said, ""About an hour."" So why is it ANOTHER hour until we get to sit down? Host: Oh, I thought we were on the same page. I'll make you my first priority, but it'll be at least half an hour. We proceeded to wait about 75 minutes for a table because we're suckers. Here's what I want to know: WHY DID HE TAKE DOWN MY NAME? What did he DO with it in that first hour? Is he just a name collector? ""Look at the list of all the people who called and gave me their names! For FREE!"" He thought we were on the same page. I was on the page where I LIVE ACROSS THE STREET and would have just gone and waited at the restaurant for an hour instead of in my apartment for an hour if the host hadn't given me the impression that I was holding a place in line by giving him my name.  Worse, he didn't even attempt to make it right-- no free drinks while we waited, no apology; he straight-up ignored us until the moment he led us to our table. Where we proceeded to drink our feelings. Angelina, you just lost a loyal customer (and big tipper!).",0.9877,0.845,0.113,0.043,0.4388026224982749
2012-03-15,5.0,"Every once in a while the stars align in spectacular ways. An initial screw-up turns into something better than you ever expected. Such was our experience with Angelina Ristorante. Groupon led us here, by accident. When I purchased the Groupon, I mistakenly thought it was for another Italian restaurant in the area, that was within walking distance for me and for my friend, Lucky Linda. Nope! It was for Angelina, which is in a neighborhood that's kind of awkward for CTA from our residences, and has absolutely no possibility of free parking. Yes, friends, I am still carrying on my fruitless and never-ending revolt against Da Mare's insidious parking meter deal.  Anyway. . . Lucky Linda called me late Friday afternoon and said, hey, let's use your Groupon for that Italian place. I looked at the fine print and saw that a reservation was required. A quick call to the restaurant resulted in a ""I can get you in at 6:00pm."" Perfect! As expected, there was no free parking to be found, so I bit the meter bullet and found a spot directly across the street.  First impression: the restaurant is beautiful. The lighting is muted, but not dim. It's easy for our middle-aged eyes to read the menu. I don't know what to call the Italian-style decoration, other than elegant. Lucky Linda remarked on the crystal chandeliers. I particularly liked the two penguin statues seated at a reserved table. Kind of reminded me of Monty Python. (""And now it's time for the penguin on your television to explode."") I didn't catch our waiter's name, but he was friendly, professional, prompt, and informative. He quickly presented us with the wine list, the menu, and a list of the specials. Lucky Linda had a glass of the cabernet, and I had the sangiovese. Both were excellent. We were given a loaf of fresh bread with an olive oil infused with rosemary. Very good. We were in a pasta mood. I ordered Garganelli con piselli and pancetta. Lucky Linda had the special ravioli of the night, which, I regret to say, I've forgotten exactly what it was. The important thing is, both were outstanding, fabulous, wonderful - as good as it can get. We took a sample of each other's dish, and jealously refused to share more than a bite. We each used a piece of bread to wipe up every last bit from the bowl. We left those plates almost as clean as my cat leaves her plate when I give her canned tuna.  We decided to share a creme brulee for dessert, since we had seen one being prepared with a blowtorch while waiting for our table. OMG - just out of this world. Maybe the best I've ever had. We skipped the after-dinner coffee. Bottom line: I never planned to go to Angelina, and Lucky Linda thought it was pretty hilarious, at first, that I bought a Groupon for the wrong place. Based on the results, I should make an effort to screw up more often. This was one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long, long time. Everything came together in a harmonic convergence of atmosphere, service, and food. I can't wait to go again. And I won't wait for another Groupon.",0.9983,0.75,0.201,0.05,0.615137207425343

[lost in the headlights look]...[pause]... You don't get fooled again!"" We had reservations for four, and the restaurant was packed. As others have mentioned, tables are right on top of eachother and our 4-top was the smallest I've ever seen. We crowded around the table and waited ten minutes for anyone to stop by to offer drinks, and another ten minutes before they were served. Still another ten to fifteen minutes later our food order was taken, and arrived served by various people (waitress, bus boy, host) some time later. Up until now, no serious complaints: Salads and appetizers were good, bread was very good (although it would have been better if it had spent a few minutes in a warming oven). As the waiter attempted to place my plate on the cramped table, he caused it to knock over a full glass of water-- which spilled across the table and on to my partner's lap. No word of apology, not from anyone. Extra napkins were delivered, my partner was soaked, and still no apology. The closest to this was when the host explained that because there is paper covering the tables, glasses don't slide, they tip over. Yes, he actually blamed the paper table ""cloth."" The main dishes were only slightly better than average. Now for the worst part: Four people, appetizers and main dishes and one dessert for only one member of the party, four mixed drinks and four beers, and two glasses of port wine.

We ordered the beef carpaccio as an appetizer and I was truly blown away. It was perfect, light, delicious. I ordered the shrimp scampi and thought the shrimp were flavorful (nice and a little spicy). The polenta was a creamy, cheesy dream. The portions were generous as well. I did think that most of the menu looked a bit on the fatty side (lots of cream, lots of cheese, lots of starch), but since I was really happy with my dinner I can't complain too much! Dessert was a bit of a letdown. I had the chocolate bread pudding, but it was much heavier on the chocolate than I anticipated. Thankfully, the pudding was moist and delicious though. Next time, I'd probably skip dessert and just order a cappuccino since they give you two lovely pieces of biscotti along with it. I would definitely come back!

The waiters didn't look like they eat either... how good could it be? Partner and I stopped for dinner shortly before our Groupon was to expire. Evidently we weren't the only ones. I'm not thrilled with their reservation system. The auto attendant didn't say anything about getting a return call to confirm just to leave a number if there were questions/problems with the request. It was a Monday, a day I believed were traditionally light dining nights; I didn't get a call back; we arrived to a packed house and no reservation. It sounded like they had had some miscommunication with a supplier or two as they were unable to prepare several items on the menu. So why the four stars you ask? All my concerns were unfounded. They have a respectable list of wines by the glass. What they presented was well plated and delicious. I had a wild boar ragout which was incredible. Partner thoroughly enjoyed the ravioli. We shared an order of their chocolate bread pudding which was angelic.

After hearing good things, and paying the big bucks I was really disappointed. My boyfriend's meal was better, but still nothing worth writing home about. We had the dessert special, three tiny cannoli's, again just OK nothing great.

This is the restaurant where we had dinner on our first date years ago and we try to come back every year to celebrate that.

Earlier this month, we called to see if we could come over for dinner and bring our 18 month old girl, they said yes, they are family friendly, so we head over for a 5:00 dinner. As usual, they promptly sat us down and set up a high chair for our little one. We asked for a plastic cup with milk, they didn't have anything but glass, but it wasn't too big of a deal as we had a sippy in the car.  We ordered our food as fast as we could, recognizing that ""eating out"" with a toddler tends to go better if it's brief. The food took a while to get to the table, and we were frankly surprised by a significant drop in the quality of the food. I'm not sure if it was just because this was a Monday, or early, or just after NYE but the gnocchi I ordered didn't have any taste and were pretty overcooked. Not too long after that our little one started fussing (nothing too bad) and we got a couple of annoyed facial expressions by our waiter, so I asked him to pack our meal and we left. Bottom line, I wasn't surprised by this place NOT being baby friendly at all, I would've just like to hear that when we called to ask.

It was on a Wednesday about an hour before they closed and there were only two other couples in the restaurant. Wednesday they normally offer a great special of 20% off to all Lakeview residents, but we used a 50% off Groupon instead. The place was small, cozy and intimate. There were lit candles on each table with very nice place settings and tablecloths. After being brought our waters and some delicious Italian bread, we were immediately told the specials and given recommendations by our waiter. However, soon after this first encounter our waiter went and sat on the back bar and began eating his end of shift meal, paying little to no attention to us the rest of the night. After a half hour passed by he finally took our order and checked up on us once or twice following that, but we were rather shocked at the lapse in service.  We ordered the Hand Rolled Gnocchi, which came with shrimp, mushrooms, and leeks for $16. It was suggested we try the Braised Beef Shoulder simmered in peroni, garlic whipped potatoes, and a very unique horseradish apple sauce for $21. I was starving but it was a very robust meal and I couldn't even finish it. Both meals were exceptionally tasty and I would love to try more of their food. We ordered our meals with two glasses of red wine which came in very small 6 oz. Tom Collins style glasses for a rather unjustified price of $8 each.

2011-10-19,5.0,"Fine Italian dining (and prices) and country western music aren't the most obvious pairing to a scots irish guy from california, but maybe here in the midwestern metropolis of chicago such things are commonplace.  Who knows? Not me.  What I do know is that after the horror that is airport food for breakfast and  a day spent mostly in airports, planes, and a crazy long taxi ride I was ready for food and Angelina hooked it up. The tables and chairs are small wooden affairs with white tablecloths and white butcher paper.  The lighting is low but not terribly so and the walls are a butternut squash golden brown plaster decorated with neatly framed illustrations that look like they were taken out of old magazines.  The restaurant itself is two neighboring storefronts joined by a narrow walkway with the kitchen behind. The waiter was friendly, helpful without being intrusive, and when I asked his opinion on what was good laughed and pointed out a couple dishes to avoid and a couple he recommended strongly.  I ended up getting the braised beef shoulder with horseradish apple sauce. When it arrived I was amazed.  This thing is massive, like most of a cow's shoulder was on my plate. It was served in a wide shallow bowl with the mashed potatoes around the base and the beef sitting on top of them in the middle with the large dollop of  the horseradish sauce on top.  The meat  was so tender it practically fell apart on my plate and horseradish applesauce - while it sounds very strange - was nothing short of awesome.  It's not really an applesauce though, more of a horseradish sauce with apple. All said it was one of the best cow-based dishes I've ever eaten.   Bottom line - this is not a place I'd come on a regular basis because it's a bit pricey, but it's kind of awesome so next time you have an excuse I'd recommend it.",0.9847,0.773,0.159,0.069,0.4138403086275426

I started with the fish soup, I'm a soup person and it was amazing, next we ordered  2 entrees, pasta with chicken and a pasta with seafood.  The seafood pasta was a steal with the amount of mussels, calamari and shrimp included in this dish and the red sauce had great depth of favor.   The only problem was the pasta was over cooked, no where near being al dente.  I suppose in Italy it could be considered a crime but this is Addison and Broadway and I'm still a fan of Angelina's.",0.9446,0.747,0.168,0.085,0.5390625000000001

I guess I was just kind of annoyed because she was nowhere to be found when we actually needed her.

A friend and I walked in and weren't sure how to get a table, but some nice patrons directed us to the other door to see someone to seat us.  We were told that it would be a little and said that we can get drinks at the bar.  I saw that everyone had mimosas, and that is what I wanted!  We were able to walk outside to wait with your drinks because it was Pride, but not sure on any other day if that would be possible.

2011-06-09,2.0,"I've been for their so-so-food brunch drunk-fest a few times, but had never been for dinner.  So it seemed like the perfect reason to buy the Groupon. I purposely waited several months after the Groupon came out so as to avoid any ""Groupon rush"" issues. We went on a fairly quiet Wednesday, fairly early. We had a busy night of tasks planned, so the plan was to go early, eat, and come home to be productive.  When we arrived there were maybe 2 tables occupied and the rest were empty.   Their menu is diverse but their wine menu is a higher price point than similar restaurants, the cheapest bottle of wine you can get is $32 or $34, but most bottles are much more. We ordered a bottle of wine, an appetizer to share, a pasta to share, and two entrees.  After ordering, the place quickly filled up with other tables.  Our wine came, our calamari came eventually. The calamari itself was grilled and in a very watery tomato sauce and it was steaming hot. It was OK in parts, and way overcooked in others. Overall not my favorite preparation of calamari.  Then we sat and waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. Meanwhile, at the table directly next to us sat the owner of the restaurant. He was in for dinner with two others, but they had I think already eaten. He was quickly brought out 3 courses and had literally finished all 3 before we even received our pasta course.  One of his courses was a pasta course itself, and he apparently didn't like it because he sent it back completely full, didn't even eat more than a bite, he literally brushed it away.  Meanwhile, this a-hole is eating dessert while we're waiting on our second course.  Other tables that came in long after us had long gotten their entrees as well.  Our server was abundantly aware of the problem and came multiple times to apologize.   At some point we decided we were going to cancel the pasta course and our two entrees and go to Fast & Fresh so as not to waste our entire night, so we waited and waited for our waiter to come back and 10 minutes later he emerged with our ravioli.  We reluctantly took it.  It was OK to start, but some of the ravioli was actually extremely cold in the center. Which makes me question if they really hand make as the menu states, or if they do hand make it and it's just not ""fresh"" .. Anyway, regardless, we then got our check. They had comped our appetizer and pasta. The problem is we had a Groupon and didn't use it because at that point it was only the bottle of wine.  So in the end, we didn't even get food we wanted, wasted our entire night sitting there (literally 2+ hours), still left hungry, AND still paid more than we would have if our food wasn't comped and we used the Groupon. Overall the food is average at best from what I've seen, the service can be good in front, but is obviously terrible in the back of house. The manager/owner sitting directly adjacent to us had to have known what was going on but couldn't be bothered to resolve problems.

The goat cheese really added to the flavor. Despite all the drinking and finishing all my breakfast, I still got creme brulee for dessert which I enjoyed.

2011-02-14,3.0,"Angelina was selected for a long overdue dinner because my friends had a Groupon for it. I've passed Angelina a bunch of times and it always looked cute and cozy, but somehow never quite made it on my hit list. The restaurant is nice, but a bit oddly laid out. The restaurant appears to be shaped like a horseshoe, there are two dining areas connected by the kitchen and a little area diners can walk through to connect them. We decided to start off with a round of cocktails before diving into our meal. The drinks were strong and good, except for the part where my friend almost blinded me with lime juice. The bar is relatively small, so even though I was disappointed that they didn't have grapefruit juice, I wasn't all that surprised. I instead opted for a screwdriver, which had a nice juice to vodka ratio. We split two appetizers, the bruschetta and calamari. Neither appetizer wowed me, but the misstep on bruschetta was our fault. Had we noticed that the bruschetta was actually a trio, one of which was olive (two of us hate olives), we probably would've ordered something else. My one friend took the olive ones, while the olive haters split the tomato-mozzarella and tuna & caper bruschettas. The tuna was my favorite, but I found the tomato one lacking flavor - the tomatoes weren't sweet and flavorful at all. The calamari was the better dish, I like that the calamari was sauteed instead of breaded and fried, but disliked that it was drowned in sauce. Despite being sauce heavy - which erred on the bland side - they weren't stingy with the calamari, which made it a good value. I ordered the Linguine Mare as my entree, which came with calamari, mussels and shrimp. Like our appetizer, I felt like my dish was swimming in sauce. I'm not averse to sauce, but I would have enjoyed more linguine and less sauce. When I finished the linguine, I still had a considerable amount of seafood left to eat, some obscured by all of the sauce. Had the sauce packed more flavor, kick or zing I wouldn't have minded. While I am thrilled that they were generous with the seafood, this dish didn't wow me either. After our meal we perused the dessert menu, but weren't taken with any of the offerings and for that I'm glad. While we were finishing off our bottle of wine we were hit with strong smells of cigarette smoke, twice. We couldn't figure out where the smoky smell was coming from, we saw no one lighting up, but at that point it killed any sweet cravings we had. Bottom line: I wish they weren't so heavy handed saucing their dishes. I also wish the food paralleled the cozy, quaint atmosphere and gave me good reason to return.",0.994,0.736,0.178,0.086,0.5951754385964912
2011-02-10,5.0,"This cute place is literally four blocks from my apartment and I have walked by it countless times. On top of that, I've had in my possession a  restaurant.com  certificate for the place.  Why, oh why did I wait so long to become enamored? Stopped in here last night expecting a nice, simple meal. We were given the choice of seating between the two rooms that make up the restaurant and we weren't forced to sit next to people - which was nice to not all be crowded into one area while the other half of the place is left empty. Right? So delicious bread and olive oil are brought to the table and we order two glasses of red wine. The waiter comes over, so cute and so nice - he welcomes us, offers up the specials - is not the least bit pushy - and leaves us to try to make up our mind on all of the delicious sounding menu items. We. the two of us, decide to split the calamari app, the caprese salad, and the baked cheesy penne pasta. Calamari: soft, lightly sauteed and coated in a fresh tomato sauce with a sprinkling of basil and capers - a large plate, when paired with the bread was so delicious. Caprese salad: hands-down the freshest mozzarella I have ever had, the tomato was tossed with some balsamic, and the whole thing had a dollop of fresh pesto and pine nuts layered on top. Cheesy, penne pasta: I missed the part where it said this was baked, so I was a little bummed expecting something different - but that was completely my fault. This was penne with fontina cheese and mushrooms. Not enough mushrooms, too much greasy cheese. We had a lovely time at Angelina's - the food, the service, the ambience was all 5's. I'd skip the main entree next time and stick with a bottle of wine and some of the appetizers.

Clearly the tomatoes and mozzarella were in the fridge for quite some time, probably overnight or since the AM. The slow roasted tomatoes were good but the cheese was extremely cold and was formed to the tomato, hence the observation that these things were chillin' in the fridge for a while. The cheese was advertised as buffalo mozz but tasted like generic mozz that you buy in a plastic tub a Jewel.  For our entrees we ordered the red snapper and the pollo saltimboca. The red snapper was very very good itself, but the corn, tomato, proscuitto, polenta mixture underneath was very bland. Altogether making the dish not very enjoyable. The saltimboca was not prepared how it usually is. The dish had a large piece of decent chicken breast covered in melted mozzarella with the proscuitto cooked in side the chicken. The dish came with bland and almost cold garlic mashed potatoes with everything sitting in marsala sauce...uh.... is this chicken marsala or saltimboca?  Anyway, the chicken was rather bland and I couldn't even taste the procuitto.

So D and I decide to share and we got the frittata and the smoked salmon benedict.  Not the most inventive foods, but delicious, perfect portions and hit the spot.  After a few more rounds of drinks, we got hungry again so ordered the tiramisu.  Let me tell you - I'm a bit of a tiramisu connoisseur since I grew up on my mom's homemade tiramisu and this one was up there!  Perfect ending to a meal.

The food was delicious, the service was prompt, and the atmosphere hilarious! It's in Boys Town so things often get pretty loud but are always fun. I have no idea what the restaurant is like the rest of the time but it's still a favorite on a lazy Sunday late-morning/early afternoon. I have gone here with pretty much everyone I know and the consensus is that it's a great spot. Be forewarned though, it gets loud inside and the morning goes on and hangovers lose ground to coffee and late-morning cocktails ;) My favorite is the banana-stuffed French toast with homemade whipped cream, real maple syrup, and fresh fruit. I also highly recommend a side of bacon (thick sliced and perfectly cooked) along with a Bloody Mary and beer back or champagne cocktail. Also worth noting is that they have a very reasonably priced special that covers your meal plus all the champagne you can drink with whatever mixer you want (oj, etc.). Forgot the price though as it's been a good couple years or so since I've spent the afternoon at their sidewalk seating getting drunk on mimosas (and going to bed very early as a result). Finally, the coffee is excellent and desserts are always tasty!!!! Parking is usually pretty good on the street. I have never noticed a valet option but they very well may have one, particularly in the evening so double-check with them if it's a needed service.

2010-07-20,5.0,"The 5 stars is strictly for dinner/dessert/service.  I've never had brunch here, so I could not comment on that.  However, I used to live by Angelina and frequently dined there when I could.  It is a somewhat small restaurant and gets crowded quickly.  I suggest reservations for a weekend night if you don't want to hang out at the small bar in the back. It is a dimly lit, cozy spot.  Not the best place for a large group or for kids.  (A personal request from yours truly: for the sanity of other diners, please, please keep your kids out of this place at dinnertime.) On one occassion we showed up and they had lost our reservation.  No big deal though, they offered us complimentary glasses of wine at the bar while we waited about 10-15 minutes for a table.  And this was 7pm on a Saturday, and packed wall to wall.  I was a happy camper. Another time, on a weeknight, there were only a handful of diners, we were absolutely famished and ordered a bottle of wine, salad, appetizer, entrees, and dessert.  Usually, just an entree and dessert (sacrifice the appetizer for dessert, you WILL thank me later) is plenty of food.  The service was prompt and friendly as usual.  And when dessert came -- chocolate bread pudding -- our waiter gave us complimentary glasses of dessert wine.  How lovely!   Now to the actual food.  The menu changes slightly depending on the season.  All the pastas are made from scratch.  If it's the right season, pumpkin ravioli is available and it is usually the first thing I look for on the menu.  I would recommend any of the pasta dishes, the beef short rib dish, and anything that contains polenta, just because polenta should have it's own group on the food pyramid. On to the most important meal of the day: dessert.  I haven't had everything, but I've had the creme brulee, tiramisu, and the chocolate bread pudding.  All are delicious.  HOWEVER, you must try the bread pudding.  It's the real reason why I'm writing this review.  I am craving it...daydreaming about it.  It's just the perfect contrast both in texture and temperature; they serve it extremely warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top--watch your tongue, you CAN get burned.  It's the ultimate dessert, especially in the winter, but I would still slap your hand if you tried to take it away from me in the summer.",0.9891,0.881,0.108,0.01,0.5125457875457876

It didnt even come with bread.  So I ordered a side of toast as an extra because those bottomless mimosas were getting to my head.  I had to ask three different people until I finally got my toast, about 15 minutes after ordering it.   All in all, I had a nice time.  But I just think that I expected a bit more.",0.9023,0.937,0.056,0.007,0.3993107769423559

And, honestly, it was just okay in my opinion. I love italian food. The bread was good, but not excellent. The wine, pretty good. I ordered the fusilli con pollo and I didn't taste any cream to the sauce, as the menu stated. It was spicy, and the flavor was there, but it was not what I expected at all. Just nothing special, it tasted like pasta out of the box and tomato sauce out of the can, with a little extra spice. I don't know. I was expecting something more homemade tasting...  and it just wasn't.  Also, I was really looking forward to the ravioli of the day after reading the reviews. I love ravioli and I was sure it would be delicious there. Our waiter, when mentioning the specials, didn't mention the ravioli. When I asked, they were out of it. :( So, maybe we just went on a bad night and I would have enjoyed that much more, but I really thought my pasta was nothing to write home about.

As we started out downtown, we initially went to Carmine's on Rush.  We'd eaten there once before and had an enjoyable meal - but this time the atmosphere, crowd, and dinner specials (not to mention the boring as can be merlot) all fell flat. We abandoned Carmine's and started taxiing up north with no spot in mind. Then I recalled having walked passed the gorgeous looking restaurant called Angelina's a few times, so we swiftly decided to try it! Thank goodness! From the moment we entered this beautifully appointed and dare I say romantic restaurant, our moods were elevated ten fold.   They sat us in the window seat, which made my boyfriend very happy - and it also meant we had our own semi-private nook of sorts. Our waiter was so fun and good-natured, his smile was contagious and I immediately forgot about the unpleasantness of Carmine's.  We had already had a snack not long before, so we opted to split the Caesar salad. For $8 I think it could be bigger, but it was very well-crafted with just a slight hint of anchovy.  The Linguini Mare, with mussels, calamari and shrimp, specifically made in a spicy marinara sauce (we asked them to make it as spicy as possible) was exactly what i had been looking for.  So good, with just the right amount of seafood to pasta ratio, and large enough to share.    Happily as well, our choice of red wine here was superior to Carmine's. Not as bold as I am used to now, but definitely present and a pleasant accompaniment to our dinner.  I truly cannot wait to go back to Angelina's.  I may have to start a fitness routine!:)",0.9973,0.73,0.23,0.04,0.5152901785714286

I knew that I couldn't stand for a wait at one of the popular spots, so I got on my Blackberry and used the handy-dandy yelp app to locate a spot for us to nurse our heads and fill our bellies.  Angelina popped up, and off we went.  I think it was a fluke, but we were able to get easy street parking right across the street.  If I were planning it out in the future, I'd bus/train it.  Everyone knows that parking in this neck of the woods tends to be a nightmare. And hurray for us, no wait at about 10:30 on a Sunday morning.  Delightful.  Again, it got crowded shortly after our arrival, so I'd make reservations in the future. The menu is small, but full of the essentials.   I wavered between the breakfast croissant, loaded with canadian bacon, smoked mozzarella and eggs and the frittata with a red pepper puree and goat cheese.  The good thing about my P.I.C. is that he is always willing to order in tandem, so he went with the croissant and I did the frittata.  Both were well-portioned and delish.  And the potatoes were quite good as well, seasoned and crispy.  The only thing to make our brunch better?  Have a third person who likes the sweeter brekkie.  Then we could have our bite of 'cakes or french toast too. Service was OK, coffee wasn't great (but real cream, so that helped), but my main gripe is the fact that brunch on Sundays is CASH ONLY.  We did not see this on the menu, yelp indicated that they took credit cards, and our check was brought to us in a credit card holder.  The server barked at P.I.C. that it was cash only for brunch.  I just don't understand the rationale behind that, and the $3 fee we had to endure from the nearby ATM left us a bit sore. Aside from this, brunch was A-OK, but there are some ways that it can totally be a four to five star experience.  Learn from my experience.

But anyway: We split a starter of pasta (and asked the waitress to have it prepared without the cream. Worked fine. Even the half portion was too much, the portion is way too big for a pasta dish (and too expensive, too, with $16) Rigatoni Bolognese Angelina Style - no minced meat in sight but more like braised meat with a tomato sauce - not too bad, interesting combination as I also could taste some cinnamon in t here. Still, too much on the plate (but again, I think that's how they like it in America) Main: Veal in Marsala sauce  - unfortunately the veal was overcooked and a bit chewy and dry. Spinach with it was OK. Dessert Tiramisu, again an Angelina self made creation. The bottom bit was actually Tiramisu as we all now the classic Italian dish, the upper bit was half an inch of chocolate cream - bit weird, tasted OK though, still classic would be much better All in all the restaurant has a good feel, but unfortunately the cooking is not too well executed.

Our waiter looked like Joe Jonas but was so friendly and created a warm environment. We started with the Carpacio ($11) that had this delicious lemon vinaigrette on top- but it was definitely large enough to share. For our main course I ordered the Fussili con Pollo ($16) that had a delicious spicy sauce and was amazing. My boyfriend was on the fence and the waiter suggested the Rigatoni Bolognese ($16) which had a slightly less spicy sauce, but was nonetheless fantastic.  The portions are big though, which is awesome because now I have something for lunch today. But if you're on a budget the pastas will split for two people. We didn't have room for dessert, although I wish I had because Joe Jonas told us, ""the almond cheesecake is off the chain"".

Bad: the bread was stale on the table, but the olive oil quality was high. My wine, which was suggested by the waitress, was not a light red as I'd indicated but a darker red. It was served in a cylindrical glass, meaning it couldn't breathe. It kind of ruined the wine for me. Psychologically speaking, it also made it look like less wine. The pasta that accompanied my dish had a pretty bland sauce.  Decor pluses: Nice looking restaurant, had a very ""homey"" feel. The linens were nice. Decor minuses: They put us in this window table with almost no chair clearance. We are not big people and yet were right on top of each other and there was no room for feet. They should be cognizant of this.  Service issue. The water guy was moving too quick and nearly cut my hand grazing it reaching over my arm without asking to refill my water from a metal jug. He apologized, but twice more during dinner actually grazed me giving me a refill. Come on. It is pouring water. I'm a pianist so I'm really sensitive to people messing with my hands.

We did have a couple of cocktails beforehand though, so we weren't sure if that was part of the reason we thought the food was so great. The menu was fantastic, the service was prompt but not pushy (our favorite kind), and we had a wonderful anniversary dinner.  Second time 2 stars: we went back because the first time was so great! The food was less than sub-par, the service was slow and did not know the menu, and we were overall disappointed since we had such a nice time previously.

We went back after deciding to have a date night and wanting their squid ink pasta again. We didn't see it on the menu, but the red pepper risotto was INCREDIBLE. If I could have, I would have eaten every single bite. The gazpacho was delicious as well, I was surprised at how fresh the cucumber taste was. It certainly didn't taste like they had used it as hot soup and then ""dr.'d it up"" to use it as a cold soup. Yum. After all of that and a bottle of wine, our eyes were bigger than our stomachs (and the dinners that neither of us could finish) so we still went ahead and got dessert. We ordered the raspberry sorbet. Tasty, but worth skipping. Eat more of the risotto if you're still hungry, it's better.  The service this 3rd time was absolutely perfect.

2009-01-20,4.0,"My girlfriend and I went to Angelina's last night for her birthday after weeks of walking past and commenting on the cute interior.  Neither of us had eaten there before nor did I check out Yelp beforehand - she picked it spontaneously and we wanted to roll with that spontaneity. My first impression of the restaurant wasn't even as a diner -- I wanted to surprise my girlfriend by bringing flowers and her present to the restaurant before our reservation, so that it could be set-up and waiting on our table when we arrived.  I called and spoke to a server who immediately understood what I wanted to do, and was happy to help out. When I arrived (3 hours prior to our reservation) he promptly took all of my stuff and set it in the office.  Everything about his demeanor said ""I've got it under control"" and I was completely comfortable leaving my stuff there. At dinner our table was set up beautifully and we were immediately seated.  Ok.  It was a Monday night and we had made reservations, but I felt very well taken care of and our server (the same one who had received the flowers and present) was attentive and polite. Speaking to the food: We ordered a side of the creamy polenta to share, which was delicious and very texturally satisfying.  I would definitely order it again. I had the special of the evening, meat-stuffed ravioli with pomodoro sauce and fresh arugula on top.  The ravioli's were light and my first impression of the dish was that it was underwhelming.  Part of that came from the small appearance of the dish: though good-sized, there were only 6 or 7 raviolis.  The pomodoro sauce was delicious and paired well with the fresh arugula.  As I spent some time with the plate I think I came to appreciate it more and ended up liking it a lot.   My girlfriend had the Ravioli Bolongese.  This was much heartier than my meal (big chunks of pork and veal) and made a real impact on the palate.  I don't think either pasta dish was the best Italian I've had, but they were both delicious and not beyond what I've paid for similar quality food. I'm not sure if I was riding on the professionalism of one server, but I came out of Angelina with a really positive perception of their restaurant.  Great atmosphere, excellent service, very good food.  I will definitely go back and be sure to update here.",0.9985,0.769,0.22,0.01,0.5286742843719588

We waited outside and there were several instances that made us think we should give up and go somewhere else, one involving an old man and a cane.

The poor servers were crazy busy, especially with this all you can drink mimosa special. Which leads me to the best part of the brunch - $20 for any entree and all the mimosas you can drink.

Example: the fritatta was described as an italian style baked omelette with shrooms and gruyere cheese. Sounds pretty good, right? Wrong!! The food itself was what looked like a quiche, was bland and cold.  Others have had not the best things to say about the eggs benedict, and that is a no-no. How can you serve brunch and not perfect such a simple, standard dish?  The service here is also something else. The first time here, we got in at the tailend of champagne brunch service around 2pm (brunch ends at 2:30). We were still able to take advantage of the brunch, but had the slowest service. We literally had to walk up to the bar to get refills. If you're going to advertise all you can drink, then please act accordingly!

Brought us out samples to help decide on wines. Ended up going with two bottles, the montepulciano d' abruzzo and a barbera which we liked. Overall the wine list okay. The prices are LOW, which is great, but I think the place deserves to put some pricier wines on the menu (the food was definitely good enough to spend more than $40 on wine). Before we even get into what we ordered, the olive oil that accompanies the bread is SO good. We don't know why, it's just plain olive oil; it seemed to be more on the fruity side...maybe we're just weird? Anyways, to start we shared the calamari. It was served in a spicy tomato sauce, can't remember what else. Perfectly cooked, not too chewy, the sauce had just the right amount of spice. Next, we had the beet carpaccio and gorgonzola, pear, walnut salads. The latter was not too original but still delicious. The beet carpaccio was fantastic. Interesting presentation, great textures. For our entrees we had the gnocchi in spicy pork sauce and the vegetable risotto. Both were spectacular. The asparagus in the risotto was fresh and still had some crunch to it while the gnocchi was perfectly cooked and the spice unified the dish by not being too overbearing.

Some of them were met while others were not.  The atmosphere is just what I have expected having peered in while others ate numerous times. I was the one to choose this restaurant given the second option of Adesso. Knowing that Adesso is more ""new-age"" Italian, I opted for Angelina's thinking it was a more traditional Italian. I was only partially correct. Both myself and my two friends had looked over the menu prior to our arrival and unfortunately, were presented with a different menu which had just been placed.  The menu was not large and offered little for a picky eater -- there was only one ""traditional"" spaghetti and meatballs type dish. I opted for the spring vegetable risotto asking to omit the spinach. We received our dishes (only after shoveling pieces of bread in our mouths...they use an infused olive oil (basil, i think) which is like crack) and the portions were humongous!

First, I have to say that the food is nothing to write home about... if you're a big drinker, I suppose the unlimited mimosas/bellinis are awesome, but that's about it. My friends and I were sitting around, enjoying our drinks while a couple of us were finishing their food.  Now, it certainly was crowded, and we probably should have hurried up and left in order to be courteous.  That said, we also hadn't gotten our bill yet, and another (bigger) table that had come in before us was still sitting there as well.  The *owner* came over to our table and was incredibly rude and aggressive to one of my friends, telling him that he had to hurry up and get out of there, and then coming back to actually take his plate away and yell at him about the food being cold, so why would he want to eat it?   Oh, did I mention that my friend was the only person of color in the entire place?  What a coincidence that he was the only person singled out-- and the table behind us, with more people, had been sitting there gabbing even longer than we had, but somehow escaped an attack. Then the boss apparently realized he had been a serious jackhole, but declined to apologize.  Instead, he sent over another round of mimosas and a bottle of crappy Brut champagne on the house.  Which meant we had to sit there longer and drink it while the increasingly frantic busboy cleared everything he could off of our table and pleaded with us (very nicely, though) to please leave.  Which we would have if we hadn't just gotten these new drinks.  I mean, WTF?

2008-04-13,1.0,"Angelina, beautiful name....too bad it leaves such a bad taste in my mouth when I think about dinner last night.  Apps- Had the Mozz Cheese covered with polenta. For $9.50 we got 2 silver dollar sized pieces of cheese and a tiny side salad. Also had the calamari, which was sauteed and then mixed with a whole lotta red sauce (gravy). Good value, but I usually prefer grilled/sauteed Calamari to be cooked and served in some nice olive oil.  My entree was the weirdest thing I've ever tasted. I had the Arabiatta, which was described as a fettuccine pasta served with a ""spicy"" saffron sauce, shrimp, capers, olives, and fried salami. I didn't taste much saffron, it wasn't spicy, the shrimp were microscopic, and the entire dish was overpowered by the salty salami chunks, that, if they were fried, they weren't in the pan long enough to have any sort of seared/fried texture to them. I can honestly say that I have no idea how to pinpoint exactly how the dish tasted except to say that it was bizarre flavors that didn't go together.  Other entrees at my table-  Veggie Lasagna was just okay. Nothing too special.  Italian Sausage in a red wine reduction served with creamy polenta. Now this was a good dish, the best thing we had all night. That creamy polenta is like a ""cream of wheat dream"". It came with the sausages but would normally be a $7.00 side. uhhh, ok, that's gotta be a money maker for them.  In fact, everything was a money maker for Angelina b/c this place is overpriced. $7.50 for a triangle sliced piece of taramisu that looked like it was a regular huge square chunk cut in half.  To top it off, the play list consisted of Jamiroquai's ""Supersonic"", and St. Germain's ""So Flute"". I am big into music people, and these are songs you go to a club and dance to, not listen to when you're trying to have a romantic or even casual Italian dinner. Thank God I was here with my family and not on a date. Service is mediocre at best. There were NO special dishes off the menu, and the waitstaff dressed in white shirts and ties doesn't match the unenthusiastic/laid back attitude.
