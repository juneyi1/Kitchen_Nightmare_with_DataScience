2017-08-17,4.0,"I will admit that I am a little biased as they have been my bar sponsor for intramurals for the past 3 years. It's a great deal as they give you 20% back on a gift card for anytime your team spends over $100. Pretty easy thing to do if you have 10 members that show up every week and some people order food or you just order shots. Plus they don't require you to show up every week to keep your sponsorship unlike some bars in the area, but my team does anyways because win or lose we still booze!  Anyways, this is a nice local bar for Old Town. They have a solid selection of beer (always important) with a full bar, decent food, and a nice patio out back. The prices are pretty standard for Chicago with good bar specials on the weekdays. The inside is darkly lit and tries to set the mood, but it has a casual vibe. I mean I come here in gym clothes on the weekdays. On calmer nights, you will hear rock, altrock, and punk music like it was 2005. On Thursdays and weekends, they blast top 40 music. They do have a touchtunes, which is a plus. It gets pretty crowded on Thursday - Saturday nights.  For food, my go-to's are the pretzel bites, chicken fingers, or the Turkey Club with sweet potato fries. Their food is decent and is your standard​ bar food so don't expect anything extraordinary.  The back patio is great! They have big umbrellas in case it rains and heat lamps for those cold Fall days. Overall, this is a solid place to grab a drink and some food when you're in the area.",0.9948,0.793,0.191,0.016,0.5405952380952381

My issue is with the rude waitress. I don't know her name, but she's a shorter brunette in her mid-20's. At first she was friendly when taking our order. However when I asked for my check, she snapped that she could only split the check three ways. There were six of us at the table. I replied with ""ok, that's fine,"" and she walked away. Ten minutes later, the waitress still hadn't brought me the check. At some point one of the girls at my table also tried asking for her check, and also received the snippy ""I can only split it three ways"" response. If there's a policy on this, I completely understand. However saying, ""Sure, I can bring you the check but unfortunately I can only split it three ways,"" would have been a much nicer approach than snapping at me and my friend. Eventually the waitress brought my friend her check, and I was still waiting for mine despite asking for it 10 minutes prior. When I was finally able to get the waitress' attention, I asked for the check again and specified who's orders should be on the remaining two checks. After giving me an exasperated ""oooohkkaaayy,"" she came back with only one check and the following response: ""I couldn't remember who ordered what, so I just put it all on one check."" I have never had a waitress give me such a hard time about paying for my food. I have worked in the service industry in the past, and I would never be this rude to customers. Even though the food was ok, I would never come back here.

The prices were reasonable, even more so because they offered half price appetizers and half price draft beers! Our bill was less than 50$ after ordering four beers, quesadillas, a chicken and brie sandwich with sweet potato fries, and a veggie burger with sweet potato fries. We sat outside (in front) and enjoyed watching the people on this quiet street head home from work.  The staff were friendly, knowledgeable, and let us ""park"" at our table for over two hours. They were attentive when we needed them, but never ""hovered"". Their draft selection was pretty extensive and we were glad to see that they even had a hard cider option. We ended up going with the Angry Orchard and the 312. We had the vegetable quesadilla appetizer. While nothing extraordinary, the app was  definitely better than your standard bar-fare. The tortilla was nicely crisped and the cheese was thick. I modified the veggie burger to include blue cheese and changed out the bun for a pretzel roll. OH MY GOSH, SO GOOD. Their house-made veggie burger was chock full of delicious veg (notably BEETS!), a massive step up from the typical veggie burger offered in other establishments. My dining companion had the chicken, apple, and brie sandwich and enjoyed it quite a lot. We both had sweet potato fries, which we both agreed were perfectly crunchy without being hard. We were also glad that they were served with little to no salt, a big plus for us, since we are both very particular about how much salt we like on things.

I asked them to change the channel to an NFL foodball game, but they failed to do so. I would assume it is because they hated me, or maybe the whole staff had severe finger tendonitis? Instead, we watched the MMA, where some dude kicked another dude in the face until his teeth flew out.  The bathroom was suspect. For some reason, the crapper did not have a stall door. Why? Did they think i was going to go in there and smoke pot or something? I actually was going to, but then I saw the lack of a door, and thought better of it. At that moment, I decided I needed to use the bathroom for its intended purpose. Needless to say, that caused extra anxiety as I was fearful someone would come in and point and laugh at me.

Granted one of my best friends, (who I will not name, but let's just say his initials are M.C.) practically runs the place, as he's there 7 days a week..  Anyways, every time I go, I'm treated top notch. The best games are always on TV, and if they're not, the bartenders will change the channel to make sure they are. Drinks are affordable, and service is quick. For food, I highly recommend a burger on the pretzel bread. Best thing ever!

2007-10-07,4.0,"Great little neighborhood place to grab a beer, watch a game and catch up with friends.  Just my luck that I discover this great little beer garden on that rare 90 degree day in October just as the cool winds are starting to blow.  Oh well- there is always next Spring! Went here to watch the Cubs in the playoff game last night.  Love their beer garden as you sit at communal tables (you can't help but meet people given this format) and they haul out to the garden a large screen TV and speakers and if you squint just a bit- okay- maybe a  lot- you might think you are actually at the game.  The food was pretty good for a bar.  The burger on the pretzel roll was huge and came with those crinkle fries that my mom used to always make.  For a little lighter dish try the hummus with warm pita or the quesadillas.  The Wells salad was also a hit with its tasty,  varied ingredients. The service was great!  We were there so long that the shift even changed but the service remained at a high level. And this beer garden is not an easy place to maneuver when it is full and there are chairs everywhere!  My favorite feature? Old glasses are cleared right away- nice for those of us who really don't want to know how much we are drinking! The crowd?  A little bit of everything.  Spill over from Corcoran's next door, locals, and on my visit last night- Cubs Fans!!!

However, I keep finding myself going back for the burger on a pretzel roll. I really think its one of the best bar burgers in the city. My brother and I go there often on the weekends for lunch when it's not too smoky. UPDATE - 11-14-07 I stopped in at Wells on Wells this weekend to get the burger and it clearly was not the same.

I agree, it is small, dark, and smokey...but it also doesn't host the yuppie agenda either. If you need a large boisterous crowd of Depaul frat boys and thirty somethings reliving their twenties to help you make a decision on where to drink- your a schmuck and you shouldn't be writing reviews. The food is fabulous, and they also have an excellent brunch.  I highly suggest the cheeseburger on the pretzel bun or the grilled calamari.  For brunch (and depending on your hangover) go with the stuffed french toast or the breakfast burrito (chorizo is awesome!!).  I like to refer this place as an ""upscale hole in the wall"" where I have never been served a weak drink or have had bad service.",0.854,0.797,0.128,0.076,0.6255128205128204
2007-03-20,2.0,"I've been down on Wells on Wells since a bouncer very aggressively threw my friend out, choking him in the process, without provocation.  The bouncer was clearly on some sort of 'roid rage, as we'd been there all of 10 minutes, hadn't even finished our beers, and most certainly didn't start anything.  To make matters worse, the manager gave us a fake name, said the bouncer wasn't an employee but just a random patron, and slammed the door shut on my foot.  So much for customer service.   After that episode, I would have given Wells on Wells one star.  In fact, I felt like it was my mission to get the place shut down.  But when I went in the next day to talk to the manager, everyone was very nice, and the owner was quite apologetic when he called me.  Possibly because they feared a law suit, but still, they redeemed themselves a little.  Still, I won't EVER go back.  The bar is certainly not cool enough to justify that kind of behavior.  I don't predict it'll be open long....every time I walk by it's pretty empty, while the much cooler Corcoran's next door is hopping.  Don't bother with this place....",0.9359,0.755,0.159,0.086,0.49489302967563836
2007-03-15,5.0,"Small little simple bar close to my Old Town stomping grounds.  It seemed like a great idea after pregaming (or pre-drinking as Chicagoans say) because the name is easy to say and ""Wells on Wells"" is pretty catchy amongst a room of drunk people.   We got there a little after midnight and 8 of us were able to grab a table front and center.  The bar prices were pretty standard, and the bartender had no problem whipping up shots and beers pretty quick.  The music was great, and overall it was a nice atmosphere.   Aside from that, stopping at this bar brought some inner peace to me.   I secretly have a ""thing"" for Wells Street.  I think it is related to the name ""Wells"" (it just sounds so sexy to me) or something.  I really don't know.  I could give it 5 stars just for the name.  Just say it to yourself:  ""Wells on Wells.""  That's hott enough to make you want to stop in, too.",0.9849,0.712,0.229,0.059,0.5617559523809523
