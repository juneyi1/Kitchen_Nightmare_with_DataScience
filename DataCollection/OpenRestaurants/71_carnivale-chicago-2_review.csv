2017-09-01,4.0,"Verdict: Great all around meal, from the drinks to the desert. We were definitely pleasantly surprised as we expected a touristy place to not be so good. Loses one star cause it's a bit loud.  Atmosphere: Really fun vibe going on. It's bright and colorful inside (like the outside), with fun music playing. Just a bit loud for our taste.  Drinks: The sangria was delicious (all of us agreed), and my girlfriend loved the cotton candy martini.  Entrées/appetizers: We all got separate meals, but ended up sharing everything anyway, so I'll just list it all. We had guacamole and ceviche for appetizers and the shrimp quesadillas and churrasco for dinner. One of the best guacamoles we've had in Chicago (from Texas, so take that how you will). The shrimp quesadillas were AMAZING! The churrasco  was well seasoned and cooked, with these great green garlic mashed potatoes on the side. We also got a side of plantains which were so sweet with a delicious caramelized crust. All around great dinner.  Desert: The coconut tres leches was delicious, just not as moist as I want my tres leches to be. The pineapple and mascarpone brought it all together really well though.",0.997,0.692,0.301,0.007,0.5791666666666667

The food was good, though! Just don't expect it to be a great experience. For the prices on the menu, one should expect more than just good food.  We were a group of 10 who spent nearly $1000.

I came here for lunch with my family, 3 people from out of town hoping this restaurant would wow them. I had come for a dinner party once before and had a great first impression.  Starting off with gauc & chips and the tasty ropa vieja it was all very good. So I would've started with 5 stars. But what was a total turn off was our waiter.  I'm sorry to say, but he was not a good one. While he was taking our order he would not look at us or smile, and instead would be looking elsewhere. My mom even asked him, ""are you okay?"" He was checked out during our whole order. And we had to get his attention again for ordering drinks. He seemed to be picking favorites, talking to a couple for 20 minutes and forgetting to put in our drink orders. Then, when the main entrees came, I think the only delicious one was the creole chicken. Also, my brother ordered medium rare for his steak but ended getting a rubbery piece of meat. So they recooked it. Overall, -1 star for the waiter, and -1 for the entrees and the experience.

I've had more flavorful skirt steak at hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurants. The service was SO SLOW. Told our server we needed a couple minutes to decide on drinks, he came back 15 min later. Once we ordered our food, it took 45 min. He never came back to ask if we wanted more drinks in between. I will say the bus boy was very good - filling water and keeping our chip bowl full for our guacamole. They added a 20% service charge to the bill and when we paid, he didn't return with our cash change. It was embarrassing to ask for the change -but at that point, we didn't feel he deserved a tip over 20% considering the service.

Needless to say - the people watching here is always 100% on point.   The food at Carnivale is good and I love the nicely tart margaritas. I would order a few things to share and focus on the tacos and salads as these are the lighter parts of the menus. They use really fresh ingredients and you can certainly taste it.

Our waitress was very sweet but very busy because they clearly were understaffed. there was a party of three of us and we waited over 15 minutes for her to come to the table to get a drink order. She had all the tables outside as well as inside it was ridiculous and we felt bad for her.  when I went to the host stand to ask if we could get a drink order the young African-American host or maybe manager told me I could go to the bar to get my drinks if I didn't want to wait. like really??  Go to the bar to order my drinks when I have a table sitting for dinner!  he was rude and on the defense and we definitely didn't like it! (I would think he would get the drink order to help the waitress out, Instead he stood with a Hostess giggling and talking!) I ordered a Cosmopolitan Martini with kettle one Vodka and when I got to drink it Definitely was not kettle one but a generic brand of Vodka!  It was not top shelf. I returned it and waited by the bar as he made it when I tasted it of course it tasted completely different than the first one! We ordered go cheese with marinara sauce and it was OK he came with the garlic toast which was pretty good but the red sauce tastes canned. we also got some type of deep fried cheese fritters of sort that was good. Guacamole which was a homemade was really good and that came with chips.  we never got silverware or napkins after getting our first appetizer and we had to repeatedly asked for them. they were really good about continuously coming up to clear our plates even after the first 3 times of us saying Not Yet! We are still eating! it was at a point that it made us feel like they wanted us to leave. Again Bad Customer service.

2017-08-10,1.0,"I visited Carnivale for dinner on a Friday night with a group of 13 girls for a friend's bachelorette.  Let me say this place was super disappointing considering the price point and the number of good reviews on Yelp. We had made a 7pm reservation for 15 people weeks in advance, but had notified Carnivale of the change in headcount 3 days prior to our reservation.  Full disclosure, we arrived late at 7:20pm, but we called them while we were on the way to let them know that we were running behind schedule.  When we arrived, they seated us at a large table by a bussing station in the back, near the restrooms. Prix fixe menus were already at each seat, and we were told that we would be served everything on the menu, family-style.  It took about 10 minutes before a server came by to take our drink order. Everyone ordered a cocktail.  It took, I kid you not, ANOTHER 40 MINUTES before any of our drinks arrived.  By this time, we were all ravenous and the food also had not yet arrived... even though the restaurant knew we were being served a prix fixe menu!!  Finally, our drinks and then our appetizers arrived.  The main course arrived about half an hour after we finished our appetizers, and the dessert another half hour later. We literally sat in this restaurant for a total of three hours, and the restaurant was also uncomfortably cold. What's worse, it was nearly impossible to get ANY decent service despite being located RIGHT NEXT TO the bussing station.  One girl in the group is gluten free/dairy free and she notified the restaurant weeks in advance that she had dietary restrictions. Despite this, they failed to accommodate her at all during the family style service... after the appetizers arrived, she had to request a gluten free/dairy free salad option.  No joke, it took them about half an hour to bring her a salad of iceberg lettuce and tomatoes.  They were super slow refilling waters and getting more drinks.  I asked for some bread at one point because we were starving, and it never came. For our large party, we had selected a prix fixe menu at $40 per person. When the bill came, we were charged $45 per person with no explanation and charged for all 15 people.  They argued with our table about us having signed a contract for 15 people and being liable for the full cost, but we had not signed anything.  They finally agreed to remove the 2 people from the bill but still charged us $45 each. At this point, we were too tired and annoyed to argue.  The food was pretty tasty, but with ~2 cocktails per person and the (of course) automatic 18% gratuity, the bill came out to ~$100 per person.  Horrible, horrible service and I will never recommend this restaurant to anyone.",-0.9732,0.83,0.063,0.107,0.5651629072681705

FYI: Please make sure that everyone arrives at the prompt time for your reservations. You can not be seated unless your whole party is there on time. Respected the policy and your party. That way no one is waiting for you to be seated.  After about 15 minutes pass our time waiting for 3 ppl to arrive. A kind gentlemen came out and said we didn't have to wait. He would allow us to be seated. That was nice of him. He walked us to our table and pulled out our seats.  By that time our waitress walked over to see if we were ready to place our drink order. We ask that she give us a little more time. She came back with glasses of water for our table. Within another 10 minutes the others had arrived and by that time we had placed our drink order.

I never had a flat breaded chicken before and there was no flavor. The waiteress was kind enough to let me and another person exchange it for something else on the menu. I ended up with the ribs. It was a little better than the chicken. But I wasn't impress with their food. The corn on the cob was delicious.  After we were wrapping up our meals.

My SO had the pork al pastor and it felt like they came out about 3 minutes after we ordered them.  I had ordered my arracherra medium rare when it arrived it looked as if it had come straight outta the fridge with barely a trace of ever being on a griddle.  I sent it back. When it arrived it had shrunk significantly but to my surprise there was some added protein crawling on my plate this time.  I tapped the waiter on the shoulder and showed him the gnat on my plate and he squashed it with his finger and told me they had a fruit fly problem.  I'm not usually grossed out by this considering if I was eating my arracherra at a backyard carne asada they would be all over the place.  I must say it was better the second time around.  I tried the pastor pork and was pleased with my choice.  The plantains that were served as a side were delightful.  After the entree the server presented the dessert menu and said that it was on the house.  She order the chocolate dome.   Which looked okay but too sweet for my liking.   The server then brought the bill and told us they were going to cover a round of drinks and dessert a total of 27 bucks. Thought this was a nice gesture but irreparable  damage had been done.  I had been wanting to dine here for years and now that I had I knew I would never return.  Anyway I hope this helps.

I  made reservations at 2:30 for Father's day because, after looking at the lunch menu, I thought it looked good and reasonably priced and that was the only available time the website gave me (I took that as a sign that this must be a great restaurant, but I was so, so wrong). So imagine my surprise when I get down there with my family and learn that they only have a brunch buffet today (which I did not see anywhere on the website) and that it closes at 3 pm and that it costs 39.99 per person. While I was disappointed, we decided to stay and try to make the best of it since we knew it would just be harder to find somewhere else to go at that point.

It was tasty but not my favorite steak/chumichurri sauce combo ever - Salmon with risotto was perfectly cooked and I loved the flavor that the tomato saffron sauce added!

2017-05-10,4.0,"*** 5/11/17 update I spoke with a General Manager on the phone this morning. And he was profusely apologetic about the miscommunication, cleared the air, and it was clear he was genuine and sincerely upset about the misstep that occurred. As I originally stated, the food and the drinks (generally) were good. Service was on point and the experience was almost flawless except for the one miscommunication which was a substantial problem. Given the sincerity of the call I am updating my review from the original 1 star to a 4 star experience, which is what I would have originally given the establishment based on the actual experience itself. While I am still not pleased by the floor manager that night it is clear this is not an upper management level problem and I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt that they do not operate in an intentionally deceitful manner. It sounds like steps were taken to address the floor manager's demeanor and to address verbiage that is better and more clearly presented to customers. ***5/10/17 Post Below *** Almost perfect experience - but the one thing that wasn't perfect absolutely ruined any chance I would come back to this establishment again. First, the good. We had a group of 27 for a birthday party. We were given our own section and the space was quite nice. The food was preordered and preset by the birthday girl since we had such a large party, and all of it was really fantastic. The calamari was perfection, the short ribs melted in your mouth, and the steak was well prepared. From a food perspective this place is perhaps a little more expensive than most but is comparable to other establishments in similar locations with similar flavor profiles. The drinks were, generally, well made. There were at least three drinks that tasted pretty horrific though -- but that was more due to inconsistency than anything (e.g. one drink was too heavy with the lime the second time around) so not a particularly big deal. The problem though that caused this to be a one star review? Management and sheer deception on their part. For the group we had preset the menu and paid a deposit for the space, food, and service -- all fine. However, when we got there a friend tried to order a drink at the bar before the entire party arrived and he was told to put his wallet away because our group had an open bar. When the hostess (birthday girl) arrived, she was told there was an open bar for the group. She talked to the manager and the server and confirmed that it was an open bar and she made it clear she had not asked for that as part of the package. They confirmed with her that it was an open bar. Several members of our party continued to ask about the open bar to confirm it was, in fact, an open bar and each time we asked we were told it was an open bar for the group. Turns out ""open bar"" just means all the drinks on their menu were available to the group. So our tab which started at $1200 (for 27 people - that's not bad) went up to $2,700 because we were all under the impression drinks were included in the ""open bar."" I talked to the manager about this, and he told me that ""open bar"" still meant someone had to pay for it and that in this instance it was an open bar on the hostess (who, once again, did not agree to an open bar for the event). Basically, management tricked us all into purchasing drinks under the false pretense that it was an ""open bar."" Each drink was individually charged and added to the general group tab. This was not an ""open bar"" and I called the manager out on that, explaining that as a person who worked in the service industry he should know better and should know what an ""open bar"" means. Let me make this very clear. If the hostess had asked for an open bar and had paid an additional fee on top for it - there would have been no problem. But the individual charge to each person for their drinks, after repeatedly guaranteeing that it was an ""open bar"" even when asked directly about it through the entire night is a despicable practice. The manager's lack of understanding, condescending attitude, and sheer indifference is 100% of the reason I will never go back to Carnivale again. The food is good -- but you can find just as good, if not better, elsewhere in Chicago pretty easily. The drinks were fine but places that are world renowned for their mixology can be found right down the street. When the management at an establishment is deceitful, upcharges unreasonably, and then does not take any ownership for their error...well... it's just one restaurant and no reason to go back. I am so outraged by this event that I fully intend on making sure the company hears about this through all available avenues.",0.9965,0.811,0.131,0.059,0.5442848788638261

Well at Carnivale open bar means we lie to you about drinks being included the entire three hours your birthday party is here, then spring a check on you later with the excuse that ""open bar means the bar is open, your host(birthday girl) is responsible for paying for your drinks."" That's not how the term ""Open bar"" is used in the service industry, especially when booking thousands of dollars in food and drinks.

However, a 20% service charge was very sneakily added into the bill as a line item listed just like the food and drinks. We did not see this listed on the bill because it was not separated, we tipped another 20% on top of that. When we noticed this later the restaurant said that there was nothing they could do about it. This is a terrible business practice that I have not seen at any other restaurant.

I understand that larger groups can be difficult but Carnivale seemed like a good spot since it's such a huge restaurant. The dining room is spectacular with bright colors and festive décor. For drinks, I got the caipirinha. It was alright, not as sweet as other places but not bad. Others at the table ordered mojitos, the cotton candy martini, or the sangria. People were happy with their drinks. The food was a letdown for me. None of the larger entrees appealed to me so I went with 2 apps and a side. I ordered the shrimp quesadilla, baked goat cheese, and side of papas bravas. The shrimp quesadilla was so bland and barely had any cheese. Basically, it was unseasoned shrimp sandwiched two tortillas. The baked goat cheese was actually tasty. It was goat cheese baked in a tomato sauce that came served with toasted bread. The papas bravas were okay and resembled square tater tots. Service was alright, except the bussers tried to clear some plates without asking (and we weren't done with them yet).

This is valuable to those who care about what their guests think. I attended a wedding here in 2014 and it was a very bare wedding experience. A wedding without food is not the kind of wedding I'm used to. The food that was served was mediocre.  First, wedding guests have to parade through the whole restaurant to get the wedding room. No separate entrance. The ""cocktail"" hour consisted of chips and guacamole served in thimbles. The passed apps were so infrequent and people swarmed the waiters like sharks. (Or like thirsty Yelpers at an elite event #shade). A kindly friend of the groom wrestled guests to get me half an empanada (the empanadas were served to guests cut in half). I actually had to take it from him bc I was going to pass out. On to the entrees which were crazy in a bad way. Choices were vegetarian, non-vegetarian or vegan. Pete and I opted for the allusive ""non-vegetarian"" which turned out to be hilarious. A plate with rice, beans, chicken AND steak.

The decor is as you'd expect for a place called Carnivale, and on my more recent visit they had flamenco dancers dancing in the spaces between he tables all night, which made for a fun atmosphere. The food is very good, and our dinners were served family-style so I got to try a lot of different options.  The ones that stood out to me were the ceviche and the braised short ribs.  Dessert was their hommade cotton candy, which come standing up tall in a glass, and pistachio cheesecake bites, which were phenomenal.  I also tried the sangria, which was delicious. Service was a little lacking-I know that with a large group things are different, but my sangria was empty for at least half an hour and not only did no one offer to fill it (they did for others, so I'm not sure if it's because I was tucked away in the corner of the room or what), but I couldn't even ever get someone's attention to ask for a refill.  It's also very loud in there-they main room is a large two-story space, so it's very echoy.  Add in the flamenco dancers and that makes it even more difficult to talk.  We were in a private room off to the side, but it was on the main floor and there was no door, only curtains, so a lot of the noise spilled in to the room.",0.2101,0.919,0.048,0.033,0.5318283362727808

They have these packages which are like $35+ which are the closest you get to unlimited. We got two which came with two bottles of Moët, juices and berries. It was cute. But let's be honest, brunch is for Shameless day drinking and I barely left buzzed The food however made up for the mimosa situation. My omelette was SOOOO Good.

I went on a Tuesday night so I didn't make a reservation but they were still pretty busy. I'd recommend making one for the weekend. Now the food, I was a little nervous to try it, but it was absolutely delicious! I definitely recommend the arroz con mariscos. So delicious!

Since first visiting this restaurant up until writing this review, I have been here a handful of times and each time I eat the exact same thing and am never ever disappointed! For apps, I recommend the brussel sprouts, ropa vieja and the guacamole. For dinner I always get the Arrachera.  The brussel sprouts are charred to perfection with lemon and garlic. Nice and crispy and not bitter at all.  The ropa vieja is so so delicious especially if you like plantains. The skirt steak is juicy and succulent.  The Guacamole is just plain and simple and very flavorful.  I truly believe that the Arachera is their best dish. I've tried plenty of others, but the combination of the rice, the red onions, the skirt steak topped with the chimichurri sauce is incomparable.

I kind of get the sense they put all their eggs in one basket and forgot you need to have solid food to be considered a great restaurant in Chicago. Their food isn't terrible, but all three times i've been here the dishes for all parties have either been really good or just mediocre that the person dealt the ""mediocre"" hand winds up picking off the other tablemates' plates!

2017-04-02,2.0,"One of my favorite parts of my weekend...outside of sleeping in is going to brunch with my girlfriend.  We live near one of the best brunch places in town but are always looking for new exciting places and today decided to try Carnivale.  It's a massive location right off the expressway and brings back fond memories of one of my favorite places in the city, a club called Drink which was a former tenant. Upon walking in you'll see a nice bar area and then the main room is filled with a ton of vibrant colors and on the weekends, they also have live music which today was really good with lots of energy and passion. I really wish I could say the same thing for the food. I ordered the $12 BANANA NUTELLA FRENCH TOAST as I was in the mood for something sweet to start the day. The dish was listed as Banana Nutella stuffed French toast, fresh whipped cream, brown butter and pineapple syrup. The item was ok at best, it almost looked like a Nutella shaped hot dog opposed to French Toast which to me has a great piece of bread that soaks up all of the inside ingredients. This bread was a bit soggy and the inside ingredients were a bit muddled as you couldn't really taste any of the banana.  The side of the plate had a heaping amount of whipped cream with a few fruits on top. I also had an orange juice which came in a shot glass and hardly tasted fresh squeezed which you would think you were getting for the $4.50 price tag.  Our server Jerry was the highlight of the meal as he was very friendly and informative. He really had a nice demeanor which is always a plus for anyone who interacts with customers. Another plus was that you can make reservations on Open Table which is key as some places have really long waits for brunch on the weekends and we walked right in and were seated within minutes. Our total was around $35 for two people which was about average for two people without any alcoholic drinks.  Average is a good word to describe Carnivale as I think the food is just ok and in a city filled with a good amount of brunch options...I think you can do better.  Jerry was nice, the music was pleasant but for a place with a tagline of Live a Colorful life...the food was a bit bland. One other note, halfway into our meal a hostess informed us that they have a no hat policy but as you'll see by the photo, it's clearly on a case-by-case basis as several other people fresh from the Shamrock Shuffle walked in wearing green hats and nobody said a thing.",0.9988,0.782,0.213,0.005,0.5073773448773446

After the food was finally given to us the waiter came within 10 seconds after receiving the food to ask how it was... he didn't come back for another hour with the dessert menu. After waiting another 15 min for him to come back to take our order the place was closing and there was only one more table left besides us. By the end we received our check and the desserts were left on there after the manager had told us it would be compensated, the waiter then said no one told him that.

2017-03-27,2.0,"Carnivale is a perfect reminder as to why good places close. Every time, I've eaten at Carnivale the food has been progressively worse example: dry, over cooked, and in some cases cooked opposite of the directions given to the waiter. Ugh, you hate to complain, because you don't want to be the negative Nancy at the table, so you suffer through whatever bites you can manage and leave it on the table no doggie bag needed. *sigh*  To be fair, I loved this place. I gave it five stars in 2011. Now, it's just a place to go where you pay more for the atmosphere, and fancy chairs than you consume in your food and drinks.  The mixed drinks are unpredictable and at $18 a glass - I have expectations, sorry! Depending on who's your bartender the drinks might be syrupy and weak or grows hair on your chest strong. I like the strong ones, I guess but when it's less than an ounce of alcohol in a tall glass, I feel like I could have just ordered a soda.  Cons- Not a place to go for cocktails. The drinks are over priced, and weak. No longer a place to go for dinner the food has dramatically dropped in quality but the prices are the same. Portion sizes are large, but if you burnt my steak and sent so dry ashy beans I won't be able to give it away let alone eat it another day.  Waiters are over worked. This place is busy to the point people aren't even making it into the dining area to eat. Bartenders aren't able to keep up with drink orders so waiters with minimal experience are mixing drinks - poorly! Between keeping up with an unusually large amount of tables, mixing their own drinks, and carrying out orders the thing that falls through the cracks is... the customer service.  This place is too busy to create a real customer experience and are frequently under staffed for the volume.

The shots were kind of pricey but it was expected. We must've had food from the catered menu because we had a bunch of small bites, which were all pretty good. We also had a ""Make Your Own Taco"" section and it was incredible. All of the toppings you can think of were part of this station.

2017-03-17,1.0,"Came for a friends birthday. We were a few minutes ""Tardy for the party"".  lol  The ambiance is fun, if say you were 12 years old and wanting to experience Mardi Gras.  It's like a very overexcited Carnival theme. Moving on...The group already had some appetizers to share on the table.  I didn't have any.  Ordered a Sangria, which was okay, an Orchid as decoration, which are actually native to tropic regions of Asia and Australia such as the Himalayas and the Phillipines (Not Latin America lol).  It's the little things.  Our server Vana had an attitude from the moment we were given menus.  She was rushing us from the second we sat down saying that we HAD to order now because she didn't want to have anyone order out of line.  I thought this place was supposed to be a fun Carnivale atmosphere, not a strict nun appointed Catholic school!  She was distant and rude, when asked about separate checks, I thought her eyes were going to roll out of her head similarly to a Looney Tunes character.   My first dish was awful.  Chicken Milanese (as we yelped quickly to get a good idea of what to order, unbiased).  $24 of pure salted overcooked plastic-like garbage.  I ate three painful bites and downed the mustard greens.  Overheard that the Chef was off that night.  Maybe we were there towards the latter part of the evening, but there were plenty of people still dining, and the cooks in the back are seriously f-ing up.  My boys' Arrachera (wood-grilled skirt steak) was dry and chewy like tasteless beef jerky.  The sweet onion was too sweet and inedible.  My fellow diners told me to order something else, as I clearly looked like someone had ran my palate over and my face showed it.  My second dish was mildly better.  Yucca gnocchi with tomato arribata, squash, shrooms, and parm. It looked better than it tasted.  The gnocchi itself was a little gummier than I'd like.  It was SPICY.  I asked Vana if it would be, as I have an allergy, and she said no.  Ugh...  As the roof of my mouth became inflamed, and rather than interrupt my girlfriends birthday experience.... I just stopped eating.  The busser was in a rush to clear our plates, sometimes before we were done.   After my friends funny Cotton Candy on a popcorn cob moment and a sparkler (not designed to blow out, as they contain both fuel and oxidizer and burn at upward of 2k degrees).  Dessert.  The ever popular and overplayed chocolate dome, that disintegrates when hot chocolate is poured overtop.  What do we have underneath, white and chocolate mousse, so OBVIOUSLY made from a powdered mix.  Ask me how I know. Yeah, well.... gross.  The strawberry sorbet, way too much sugar, the strawberries, overripe, bruised and should NOT be used as a garnish.  $105 for 2 people, completely and utterly dissatisfied.  Darrell, the assistant GM, who my bf contacted about the meal, was supposed to send us gift certificates and never did.  Don't waste your money, the food and the experience is like Chucky Cheese for grown-ups.  It may have been good when it opened years ago, but it's become an abandoned circus....",0.9897,0.815,0.125,0.06,0.4667824074074074

I'd never been to the restaurant before, so it was decided that we go here for a belated birthday dinner, sort of to see what all the hype was about. When first walking in, the whole scene hits you. It's very busy on a Saturday night, so it's a good idea to make a reservation. And it's extremely colorful that's for sure.  Because it was so busy, at times it was a bit difficult to get the attention of our waiter, so keep that in mind when you go on a hectic night. Dinner was decent, but not profound. For dessert we got the Cuban cigar which was okay. But the smokey-ness of the chocolate cigar wasn't exactly to our liking. If you order this when you're there, you'll know what I'm talking about.  Unfortunately there was also a slight mix-up with our bill. But it was good we found the fault before it was too late, otherwise we would have been over-charged. All in all, it was an okay night, mainly because the company and conversation was good. But if I were to go back, it would likely just be for drinks.",0.9554,0.845,0.12,0.035,0.5504526748971194

I always forget his name though...But, he's great and has never steered us wrong with any of the things on the menu. The menu is seasonal, which is great because every few months the dishes change around a bit and there's something new to try. One of my favorites is the Ropa Vieja. The super flavorful brisket is served in a little taro(?) taco. You have to start your meal off with an order (or two) of those. The ceviches are delicious as well and you can't really go wrong with any of the entrees.

The carrot and ginger salad paired well with the salmon. As for the Arrachera and the Bolivian Lamb Rack... Hats off to the chef because they were both perfectly medium-rare! Everything about both entrees were delectable and I simply can't get over how amazing the lamb rack was. For dessert, the cotton candy was such a cute gesture. I never thought I'd be served cotton candy and caramel corn as a treat after dinner. I felt like a kid again. Then came the Cuba Cigar. The presentation was worthy of ""Ooh's"" and ""Ahh's"".

We visited this restaurant two years ago and loved it.  So, of course, we wanted to come back.  Some of the items we had 2 years ago are still on the menu, specifically the brisket tacos appetizers, which is still a winning combination.  We had the Yucatán salmon, which promised a Yucatán achiote marinated and cooked in banana leaf, harking the ""pibil"" preparation.  While the fish was nicely cooked, it was bland and lacked the depth of flavor one would expect from the archiote flavors (usually paired with citrus).  The other dish we ordered was a pork chop that promised the flavors ""al pastor"" pork.  Instead, we did get a nice juicy pork chop, that was insipid.  The sauce was reminiscent of BBQ sauce, lacking the flavors of chiles, and it seriously needed salt.  The sides on both dishes were bland and uninspired.   I do not think we will make the trek to Carnivale again.",0.8832,0.845,0.108,0.047,0.6720238095238095

I really enjoyed the short rib paired with the grits.  For dessert it was a sort of cheesecake dish. It was so good! Very light and fluffy.

2017-02-05,4.0,"I celebrated my 23rd birthday at Carnivale last night with my whole family. I made reservations a few days ahead of time for Saturday at 5:15 during restaurant week. The inside of the place is vivid and amazing. I felt like I was in some rustic Argentine/South American eatery. The faded pink, orange, yellow and other bright colors adorned the walls, the lamps, the high up ceiling and the décor. Exotic plants and colorful furniture added a lot of charm to the place. The atmosphere at Carnivale is worth coming for alone, I've never been anywhere like it. We ordered a few drinks at the bar before being seated since we were early and there was a slight delay between our reservation time and our seating time. I personally had a fantastic Caipirinha that wasn't overly sweet. My mom had a margarita and my dad had the sidecar, both of those were delicious too, fairly standard pricing for the city but not outlandish. We were seated in the big open colorful room at a round table. It was adequate and comfortable for 7 people. We perused the menu and started with guacamole, coconut shrimp and the ropa vieja. The guacamole was simple but delicious, it was served cold and honestly made an interesting difference. The coconut shrimp was flavorful, and we especially enjoyed the ropa vieja, which was beef brisket inside these little tacos. A couple of us got the restaurant week menu and had the beet salad as well as the ceviche. I thought the shrimp ceviche was outstanding, the tuna good, the salmon okay. For our dinners a few of us had the skirt steak, one senator's chicken, the short ribs and the wood grilled sirloin. Everyone really really liked their food. My steak was done perfectly medium rare, it was so tender and flavorful, it had a sweet potato puree with chimichurri sauce and wow this was such a unique taste. I really need to eat more south American food because the flavors are so rich and different. We all thought that by far the short ribs were the best dinner on the table though. They were melt in your mouth consistency, braised with flavorful chicha morada  and served over grits; everything about this dish was amazing. Portion size was good on all the food, they are definitely not skimpy here. We did get dessert, my mom and I opted for the dessert trio. There was like a layer cake and a couple of ice creams, the layer cake was the best. They also gave me a complimentary cotton candy for my birthday which was cool! I haven't had the stuff in forever so it was a trip back in time. The service was good, I missed our server's name, he had a very thick accent (maybe Brazillian?) and was sometimes hard to understand, especially over the volume of the music in the big room. He was accommodating and explained everything very well, although towards the end he wasn't around as often. The only reason I subtracted a star was because my grandparents' skirt steaks were served over rice and they both said the rice was cold. I can't vouch for this claim, but the server brought us a fresh side of rice that was hot after we told him. Overall a very good experience at Carnivale. It is a really really unique place that I like a lot. All of our food was high quality, rich/flavorful and exceptionally put together. The restaurant week menu was a super deal. This experience has piqued my interest in this type of cuisine and I will certainly be looking for more places like Carnivale in the city.

I went here again this winter for Restaurant Week 2017 since my dad had never been here before and he wanted to try this place out. Ambience: it looks so fun and vibrant inside! I love that the ambience is so fun, it's like you're in Brazil celebrating Carnivale. The chairs and furniture are so colorful, it looks like Alice in Wonderland haha. Service: Service was excellent as our waiter was attentive and explained the menu. Both times that I've been here, I did not have to wait for a table which was a good thing. Our waters were filled and tables were cleaned when we were done eating. Food: The first time I went here, I ordered the ropa vieja ($11), which were cute little tacos with braised brisket. This was yummy and one of the popular items on the menu. The serving is small but you'll be full because the entrees are huge. Order the arroz con mariscos ($15)! It had saffron rice with mussels, shrimp, clams, and calamari. The rice was cooked perfectly and it felt like comfort food with the seafood. My dad loved his arrachera ($18) which is a skirt steak topped with chimichurri sauce and included rice and beans. It was flavorful and very tender.  For restaurant week, I got the $22 lunch which included an appetizer, entree, and dessert. I ordered the Amazonian Salad (normally $11) which was huge, I couldn't even finish the salad. It had dates, queso fresco, hearts of palm, cherry tomatoes, cashews, avocado, and champagne vinaigrette. It was so refreshing and light.  For my entree, I got the arrachera sandwich (normally $12.50) which was pieces of skirt steak served in French bread, green papaya salad, chili aioli, cucumber, and cilantro. This reminded me of banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich) and it was delicious! As for dessert, I got the Pan Dulce de Queso, which was a cake with guava marmalade topped with pistachio ice cream. This was so good and the flavors worked so well together! I ate the whole thing in like 10 seconds, it was heavenly! Verdict: I love Carnivale and it's such a great place to eat.

When we arrived for our 8:30 reservation, we checked in and still had to wait 25 minutes...my rating is based on the following : Atmosphere- Wonderful! Incredibly lively, colorful, and great music. If you're a fan of noise and bustle, then you'll like this place. Service- The food took a while to arrive and the waiter took quite some time to take our order. The wait for food I understood because it's a 3 course meal. Food- To start off, I got the empanada. Very tasty. The meat was juicy and well seasoned, and the sweet potatoes complemented it perfectly. For the entree I got the pollo criollo. It was very juicy and a solid portion. Finally, for dessert, I got the pan dulce. Delicious! The guava sauce complemented the actual cake perfectly. I got the Carnivale martini to drink and loved it. If you like sour drinks then you'll enjoy this one. I also had the cotton candy martini. It was ironically more sour than the Carnivale martini. I'd opt for The Carnivale martini over the cotton candy (the latter was too sour for my taste). Overall, I'm definitely coming back here. The atmosphere and food combined made for a great dining experience. I do wish we had been able to sit in the main dining area(the one you see in all the pictures), but it was too packed.

The fish tacos were scrumptious and a nice highlight. The lamb was tender and flavorful. I recommend the lamb as the entree. I was concerned about the pumpkin but it was a nice touch.

I enjoyed the burger but it's nothing special than if I were at another burger joint. My friends got the chicken waffle, skirt N eggs, carnitas omelette and tripleta burrito. The chicken and waffles caught my eye because it was served cut in triangle pieces with the chicken sandwiched in between. Overall everyone enjoyed their selection. We also had a child with us which they mentioned a child portion of waffles is available.

2016-12-31,1.0,"I've eaten here a few times now and the food is alright. Nothing too insane. It's a fun looking place though with a fun atmospheres. Good for a birthday. I actually thought it would be the perfect place for a party I was planning. I called ahead and made reservations for 2 tables because we didn't want or need a room. The girl who answered said it was no problem and we could even have the tables together/by each other. She was very nice and helpful.  Moving forward... I was super stoked about it and had invitations made that same day I booked, for the party and people started to rsvp right away. Suddenly, about a week before the party I get a call from a guy at Carnivale (out of respect I won't name names but I've got them all writen down!) saying there was an issue with the reservation and that they needed to inform me of some things so there was no embarrassment on the night of my party. Um excuse me? Embarrassing for who... You? Because you/your staff messed up? Suddenly, if you have a party of over 8 you need to give your credit card and put a down payment? And suddenly, because the party size we have, I need a room and can't use the normal dining area? Oh and it's a 1k deposit and a 2k minimum for said room! But since they already said to me I could do the party... I had to come earlier when they aren't as busy but still needed my card on file in case I cancel they can charge $25 a person. Listen I planned a party at a specific time for a reason. I'm not changing my whole party for the problems you made for me WHICH I WAS NEVER TOLD FROM THE BEGINNING! To make it THAT MUCH WORSE... I said I'd have to call back later and see what I could do because I made major plans surrounding dinner. Hotel and bars and a show all based on dinner here at this location at this time. I was told I had to hurry and call back right away because they are booking up with a lot of parties. Ok how about regardless you hold me a damn room for your errors. I'd probably have spent 3k in the end here and you toss it in my face? As a matter of fact, week notice or not, I'll find a different place and spend DOUBLE there just on principal alone. Listen I don't care about the price. I'll spend whatever, I'm by no means cheap. It's the fact that the guy had an attitude, I was never told any of this from the start, your people made all the errors not me, I'm trying to give your restaurant business!!! Then you wait to inform me of this a week before my party. Plus you rush me like my business doesn't matter because you'll just shovel another party in the room...   It's just bad customer service. Bottom line. I was handled poorly from start to finish. I would never set foot in this restaurant even if the meal was free. I would never recommend this place because like I said to start the food isn't majorly amazing but the service is a joke at best. Plan a party here at your own risk friends!

2016-12-22,3.0,"I went to this restaurant the week before Christmas, therefore their establishment was decked out in beautiful holiday decor with a huge tree in the dining area.  The colorful tree combined with the pre-existing tropical colors was very pleasing to the eye and added to the ambiance of the night. Very festive environment with a nice bar and live music in the front of the dining area (on Wednesday nights).  For starters, we ordered cocktails.  We originally ordered the Carnivale Martini and the Las Flores.  The CM was okay despite the bitter tasting tequila. I personally did not enjoy the Las Flores one bit. It was not sweet nor tasty.  So we decided to exchange the drinks (since we did not enjoy them after one sip), for the Secreto (for two).  The Secreto was a much better drink.  And trust me when I say the drink is literally good enough to satisfy two people.  Especially if you love Vodka, Gran Marnier, cranberry juice or pineapple juice.  I wasn't a fan of the Absolut Vodka, simply because I prefer Grey Goose Vodka.  But anyways, it was tremendously better than our original drink choices. The manager was very kind enough to make the exchange without any charge. We were very appreciative of that.  As for the food, YOU MUST GET THE COCONUT SHRIMP! It is DELICIOUS!  The guacamole was very tasty too! I would recommend getting guac and chips if you you love guacamole.  For the entree, we both ordered the Arrachera.  It was pretty decent. I liked the flavor and chimmichurri sauce.  As a steak lover, I wasn't highly impressed but hey, this isn't a steak house so I wasn't expecting much at all.  I say you should get the steak medium-well.  I would go back again with friends and actually just order the appetizers to be honest.  They are filling and taste really good in comparison to the entrees.   One thing to note, their menu changes frequently with the seasons, so some items are not served year round.  As for price, I felt that the Arrachera was a bit overpriced.  But overall the meal was 110 bucks for two with drinks, 2 appetizers and 2 entrees.

I went home with a doggy bag and had left overs for lunch the next day. :) As far as desserts we had to get the Cuban cigar, the chocolate dome cake and the tres leches.

The original reservation was for 15 people on prix fixe terms which they misleadingly refer to as ""tapas"". In the end only 10 people could make it and we wanted to order off the main menu. The manager categorically said this was not possible as they had already ""cooked the food"" and that our only option was prix fixe, but we should not worry because they would charge us only for 10 people ($45 per head) and serve all the food that they already allegedly cooked for 15. He also said that if we left they would charge the card that was given to them to hold the reservation so we had no choice but to stay. We were served so called ""tapas"" which included Caesar salad (WTF?!), some other kind of salad and three plates of main courses. The quantity of food was scant and sure as hell it was not made for 15 people. Basically we ended up with two plates of some ridiculous salad and three smallish plates of meat/seafood dishes for $450! Plus, they charged children under 10yo the same amount ($45 per head) for the food that they barely even touched. Also, considering the quantity of food I can't imagine that was cooked ahead of time. To add insult to injury, they added a MANDATORY 20% gratuity on groups over 6. The service was so mediocre I would have never tipped such an insane amount.

I'm not sure about that one, but even if I considered the food not to be Latin, the taste and flavor was simply inadequate for me (at least make good fish tacos?! simple enough and not too ""Latin?"").

Our entree selections consisted of their Yucatan Salmon and the Vegetarian Tacu Tacu.  I could spend an hour writing my praises of these dishes.  They were done perfectly, and with the Tacu Tacu, I'm going to swear that I didn't miss the meat.   What are you looking for in a dinner?  Pleasing to the eye, flavors that are nuanced, innovative and surprising to the palate, variety on the plate to add something new to each bite, sufficient volume to satisfy your appetite.  Yup, that's what we got.  Each dish had a surprisingly bright sauce that just exploded in your mouth with the food.  The salmon was done perfectly, moist, tasty, and fork tender.  The rice and lentil base of the Tacu Tacu was crunchy and tender at the same time, with fingerling potatoes, and purple and orange carrots..  The pea curry sauce lit up my taste buds and brought a smile to my face so broad that my girlfriend looked at me and said, ""What?""   The dinner was wonderful.  Absolutely. For dessert, we had the Chocolate Dome with White and Dark Chocolate Mousse.  My girlfriend isn't a fan of white chocolate, but I convinced her that if the Chef, who had made every dish so wonderful up to that point, decided that this white chocolate mousse was up to his standards, who were we to argue?  So that's what we got.  The dark chocolate dome was probably 6 inches high, and Jorge slowly poured a hot chocolate sauce over the center of it, melting the dome, and causing it to crumble in to reveal the twin mousses (or is that mice?) in the center with the strawberry sorbet.  The white chocolate mousse didn't disappoint.   As we savored the dessert and the remaining wine in our glasses, my Park Chicago meter expired at the end of the shortest two hours I have EVER spent.  I added another half hour, and we continued.   It was a truly delightful evening, delicious food in a wonderfully bright and entertaining environment, with a great waiter and sommelier that made the evening perfect.  This is now our new favorite restaurant in the city.  Jorge, we will be seeing you again soon.  Find me a great bottle of wine to go with our next meal.",0.9995,0.755,0.235,0.011,0.5923200061842918

2016-09-25,2.0,"I was really excited to try this place. I've been driving by it for years and always wanted to check it out. We had an 8:45 reservation and were given a pager upon arrival. The hostess skirted around the question when I asked how long we'd have to wait; luckily it ended up being only about 10 minutes. We were greeted a few minutes after being seated by a very friendly waitress who provided food recommendations and was helpful (service is not the problem here). We started with mojitos and margaritas which the group agreed were underwhelming. The appetizers, coconut shrimp and an order of guac and chips, came out promptly. They were DELICIOUS so we were ready to be blown away by our entrees. Unfortunately the entire table was disappointed in our main courses; we could have gone to a cheap Mexican restaurant for better-tasting food and paid way less. The vaca frita was beyond dry despite being ""known for its juiciness"". The lamb was undercooked and practically inedible according to our guests. So next we were ready for dessert. We have a birthday in our group so they brought out the cotton candy - amazing. That was by far the group favorite. We also ordered the chocolate dome. It looked delicious and was presented well. When they bring it out, they pour chocolate sauce on it and the dome melts down to a small portion. The chocolate part of it tasted great but the strawberry sorbet side was left untouched by the group after one bite. We also ordered the Cuban cigar which was my personal favorite. It is presented in a steaming cigar box which gave it the perfect amount of smoked flavor. Overall, I'd say the ambiance and service are great.

I especially gravitated towards the guacamole, beef quesadillas, and the El Jimador margaritas. They provided live entertainment in the form of what I think is a type of yoga (where they climb upwards towards the ceiling on two thick bands of fabric). The only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is because there was something missing a bit in terms of the atmosphere, which may not be Carnivale's fault; it may have been our conference booking out the entire restaurant and not being able to fill it up.  Extra points to Carnivale for their interior design, which became the subject of many conversations during our time there.

The ceviche mixto.. 3-4 small samples of ceviche... $25 for literally samples (PASS ON THIS) And an order of the calamari was good, and crunchy. Dinner: I ordered the Arrachera which was tasty, tender and a decent size, but literally a big chunk of carne asada, Definitely not worth the $30 price .. My boyfriend ordered the Vaca Frita, which was also good, with a side of black beans and white rice .. Tasty.. But again, not worth the price ..  Overall, we enjoyed our dinner, but service sucked ..

2016-08-09,3.0,"My boyfriend has been eyeing this place for ages from the highway and always commenting on how he wondered what it was like inside & wanted to try it out. For his birthday, I booked us a dinner there and we tried it up!  Upon walking in you're met with bright colors everywhere and insanely loud music. There was a live band and dancers right by the hosting stand. It was fun to see the dancers but that music was ear piercing and we couldn't communicate at all while waiting for our table. We hoped hard that we weren't seated anywhere near the band and thankfully we weren't. The atmosphere here is loud & vibrant and on a Friday night, I counted 6 bachelorette parties...and I have a feeling more were lurking. I have a small obsession with cheese plates so had my eye on the platter to start off with. It was a very solid plate with three cheeses, grapes and honey. Those three ingredients are a winning combination for me. Three cheeses were included - a bleu cheese, harder cheese not sure what it was, and a butter like cheese. All were good, loved them all and couldn't stop eating this $16 starter. The Ropa Vieja seemed really strange to me. Well...I should say didn't sound appetizing to me because the name means Old Clothes in Spanish...so....not too sure why they call it this but it's supposedly one of their most popular appetizer items. For $13, you get 5 braised brisket tacos in hard shells topped with plantains, malanga, aji amarillo aioli and queso fresco. I liked this dish, didn't love it. I did love the Tacos de Pescado (ie tempura cod fish tacos) for $12. These 3 little guys were topped with a vigorón slaw and chipotle aioli making them just delicious, albiet slightly soggy from the toppings. Side note: Valet parking is $7 + tip but if you aren't late like us, I'm sure you could find a parking spot with a little hunting.  Pro-Tip: Lighting sucks for food pron...sorry but it just ain't gonna happen here. Maybe I expect too much but I noted it was his birthday on our reservation, they even asked about it and we still had to wait 20 minutes past our reservation, were seated between two big drunk bachelorette parties, no one said happy bday and they didn't do anything special like a dessert or anything for him. Lame. Service was fine and attentive though nothing extraordinary. Very loud atmosphere and not quite my scene but for those in college, I'm sure it's a ton of fun to be here!

(Probably from all the excitement and love for this place) Before coming to Chicago I was searching for a restaurant for my birthday and came across Carnivale. The pictures were intriguing and although it had mixed reviews I wanted to give it a shot, and boy am I glad I did!!!!!!!! We made reservations and arrived around 9 walking into the most colorful vibrant Latin ambience. We still had to wait 20 minutes for a table to open which wasn't bad considering it was a Saturday night. After being seated we were promptly greeted by our wonderful entertaining waiter whose name I wish I could remember (Brandon maybe?). My order consisted of the Senator's chicken and for desert I had the chocolate dome, and of course the free cotton candy with caramel popcorn for being the birthday princess. One bite of the food and I fell more in love than I already was. I couldn't tell you what it was other than you have to try it to know. My friend also was in love with her food choice (I don't remember, sorry) after her first bite. This place is so different from any other restaurants I have gone to and would recommend it a million times to anyone asking for a good place to celebrate something.

2016-07-11,2.0,"If it wasn't for the atmosphere and service this place would have been one star. Yes this place looks amazing inside and waiters are great as well BUT as far as the food goes BLAH!..... Way over priced on my arrechera steak dinner, The meat itself was very tuff to chew they try to sell it as no hormones added type of meat but I think that was a complete lie and I also think that's why they overdo it on the nasty cilantro sauce to hide that cheap meat, The plate itself was $30 really not worth it I see it as a $15 max plate considering the small portions of rice and meat you get, Plate presentation was on point ill give it to them but again doesn't matter because the food itself was not good at all, the drinks are also very expensive and terrible BUT once again the presentation was on point, Overall I really regret taking the GF here for her 28th the only thing she fully enjoyed was the free birthday cotton candy, I personally rather of spent a little extra and go to Mortons/ Gibson etc etc.  One last thing, I called to find out about the parking they told me it cost $4 an hour for self park on the street or $7 for valet PLUS tip she said? really?..... Anyways! I am a cheap when it comes to parking because I am not that lazy I went on  spothero.com  and paid $2 for self park right behind Carnivale it was literally right behind Carnivale on wayman st. on Saturday at 7pm there was plenty of parking, $2 for up to 5 hours to park, Its more expensive to pay the meter so I suggest SpotHero and print it out and just display the paper on your dash...",-0.8795,0.843,0.063,0.094,0.5749404761904761

2016-06-30,5.0,"Carnivale BEATS any wedding venue in Chicago in any shape, form, or fashion! The place is dashingly beautiful and will wow guests with their unique and colorful decor.  We initially worked with Ally, (who later resigned to pursue being a stay at home Mom) to which we were then introduced to Doug. We were skeptical because we laid the ground-work with Ally and almost felt as if we were starting over with Doug. When I tell you this guy is fantastic, WOW! He was EXTREMELY thorough and worked so hard to make sure we had everything we needed. He was so accommodating and he made planning a wedding as painless as possible. We LOVED his worth ethic, responsiveness, professionalism, and his down to earth personality. Doug is also good at getting a feel for your budget and will recommend great ideas based on what he's experienced with other weddings. We are BEGGING for another reason to have to work with Doug just because he's so damn GOOD. He also serves as a day of coordinator to ensure everything runs smoothly. The food... Probably the greatest thing about this venue. We received countless texts and calls about how good the food was! Their menu is seasonal so it's ever changing but we had a REALLY AWESOME menu! We didn't get to eat as much as we wanted but we already had all the food at the tasting beforehand. We don't think there is a bad tasting thing on their menu... Top notch food! We spent about 16K (with consumption bar) for 121 guests. This can be pricey for some but Doug knows how to cut corners and alter things to get the price where you want it. They require at 5K to reserve the date, at least 8K for the wedding to go on, and you can pay the remainder afterwards. We said that we would make it an annual thing to go to Carnivale in honor of having our wedding there because we love this place so much. If you are contemplating on having your wedding here, please do it. Doug will make sure you're in GOOD HANDS!  THANK YOU CARNIVALE!!!",0.9944,0.792,0.17,0.039,0.5972222222222223

Don't be scared to dress up or dress down-it's really for any occasion like a night out with the girls or a fancy date. Only downside I had was my waitress was no where near a Sommelier. I asked what wines she recommended and it was like she gave me the basics: ""We have a good merlot, or or a pinot or a cab-"" noooo really?! Def expected a little more than the Trader Joe basics. Another downside? Depending on where you sit, you can be buried in the back corner arm and arm to the table next to you. I didn't have a good time with the obnoxious pretentious millennials next to me-I tried to tune them out trust me when I say it was next to impossible. Moral of story? Ask for a booth.

There was a bowl with a humongous mound of guacamole....I went so hard on that stuff. Ridiculous. And of course, fresh, warmed tortillas, and chips and salsa rounded out the meal.

The small piece was tender and medium rare. Then as I was done was that piece, the rest was my steak was overcooked, chewy, and a bit dry.

The decor and ambiance is beautiful. I love the dim lighting and bright colours. You honestly feel like you've been transported somewhere els when you walk into the restaurant. Perfect for a date or ladies night. It would also make an amazing night club.  The service was great I don't have any complaints. They were very professional, organized and prompt. There was no personal touch or wow factor to push it over the edge.  The food was good and beautifully presented. Again the food didn't wow me or make me think days later I'm craving that amazing xyz from carnivale. However, the drinks were strong (which is always good) after my second I was feeling a buzz which is rare. I also like that they offer caramel popcorn topped with cotton candy for birthdays. Thats a fun treat to share. The sugar used to make the caramel to coat the popcorn was burnt and I could taste the bitterness in the caramel but overall it was still a good experience. I would definitely come back here. They have an extensive drink selection and cool desserts so I'll be back to try some more.

This is not to say the the food isn't good because it absolutely is but wow hats off to whoever designed this place . Parking is valet;  complimentary  last time I went on a Monday for lunch though it is has been roughly 5 dollars other times I've gone. There is street parking as well. The environment again will grab you soon as you enter . Vibrant colors and Latin based music playing. I mean it really does feel like carnivale. Love it So I been here a few times but I'll discuss my recent lunch . There was a 22 dollar full course entrée which included the  lobster empanada, short rib, and for dessert the tart. I really enjoy the empanada though my guest who has way more experience partaking of Latin food says it was ok. My short rib was mouth watering amazing. I would certainly order it again. The tart was great if you're fond of sweet with a hint of sour. The guacamole was great as well and worth trying if you want to be on the safe side for an appetizer .  Overall, the visual warrants at least one dine in experience and my personal recommendation from the menu off recent memory is the short rib and guacamole. Everything else is enjoyable though and you have a variety of options . One of those spots  everyone should try once .",0.9977,0.72,0.269,0.011,0.43335034013605445

The colors, furniture, pictures and sheer size of this place are all worth experiencing on their own, and although you are one of many people in many rooms being served, you won't feel neglected, and their kitchen moves at a good pace.  We went for Chef's week and therefore had the prefix menu: Lobster Empanada, Mariscada (saffron rice with clams, mussels, a lobster tail and claw and whitefish), Short Rib a la Brasa, and Rhubarb Tart. Although these aren't standard dishes, the two entrees have close relatives on the normal menu, and the tart may be in the seasonal pie rotation. First, every dish was cleverly conceived, the foods were very fresh, cooked perfectly, and covered in delicious sauces and spices. If possible, the lobster empanada should absolutely join their all-star lineup of standard menu items. The Mariscada had a piece of whitefish that I'm assuming was bred and raised in a tank of butter. My boyfriend, whose a picky, East Coast-born seafood snob, was surprised by how well the lobster, clams and mussels were all prepared. Although I don't care much for rice, I was even impressed by the saffron rice. The braised short ribs were everything you could ever want in this great cut of meat, the accompanying charred vegetables and leak puree were worth ordering by themselves, and the Rhubarb tart filling in the dessert was both delicious to a sugar addict (me), and one apathetic to its allure (my boyfriend).    Besides the Caesar salad (boring) I desperately want to try every single thing on their menu.

Although we are all from the area, none of us had been to Carnivale before and we were excited. The atmosphere was great, the decor is colorful and fun and it seemed like we were in for a good time.  We arrived a bit early but were seated just after 9 upstairs. Our waiter Rick came over and went over all the specials and the menu. We said we would just be getting dessert and drinks and his whole demeanor changed. He suddenly became very cold and rude. We needed dessert menus so he left and came back with 1 menu for our 5 person table and said it was all he could find. I don't know what the issue was, it's not like we came in at 7pm looking for just dessert. It was later at night and The restaurant had many empty tables at this time and we still ordered $75 worth of food and drinks.  Once dessert came, Rick did not check back on us a single time until he brought the check. My friend asked for change and he was rude about that also. For a group of people who live in the area and go out often, this was an awful first impression of Carnivale. These servers are supposed to be professional and he put a weird and awkward feeling over the end of the night with his attitude.  In terms of the dessert, they all were amazing. We tried the chocolate dome, ice cream cake, coconut pie and cotton candy. We also had the chocolate cigar but no one really liked it, it seemed to have a weird plastic type taste.

2016-04-16,2.0,"Why I Cancelled My 13-person casual Birthday Party Reservation..... Hello All.  I've hear a LOT of great things about Carnivale, but I didn't get a chance to experience them.  Why? Well I thought the ask was ridiculous for bringing the restaurant a large party when they opened at 5PM on a Saturday afternoon (April 23).  There were three deal killers: (1) Immediate push of a customized menu, (2) A $2.50/person cake cutting fee and (3) only up to 4 separate checks.  Let's start with the customized menu; now as much as I like the ""small plates"" approach, I really feel the strength of the menu was its ala carte selection.  I didn't want to force it on my party nor did I want to be driven into being responsible for $39/per person (or $49/person for a couple added choices).  Next, I understand the burden of how a large party requesting separate checks can wear on a service staff, but at 5PM, when the doors open on Saturday? I've been a server, I've been a restaurant manager in my day and I can count on one hand the number of time I was slammed with customers the moment the door opened... on a Saturday afternoon.  Again, I understand that a place needs to make money off its menu and again it can be a real burden on a staff that's really busy, but charging a $2.50/per person ""cake cutting fee"" at 5:00PM is ridiculous. The revenue the restaurant would make of the liquor (and tips JUST on the liquor) alone would more than outweigh the hassle of separate checks. As for serving ""slices of cake"", my party was going to be treated to cupcakes and that's pretty self-serve. I understand there are policies to make life simpler for everyone, but context is everything.  I guess the one thing that came loud and clear was ""if you bring a large party, please make sure it's as convenient as possible for US, Carnivale.""  Well a quick call around the city and it was easy to find a NUMBER of places that were happy to have us with our somewhat ""unusual"" conditions. Phone called made.  Reservation cancelled.  Maybe one day I'll experience what seems to be a great South American inspired eclectic cuisine, it just won't be for this event.",0.9941,0.732,0.188,0.08,0.6389656938044036

The restaurant was totally open (no party to be seen in the bar area), so we sat at the bar and were quickly greeted.  We ordered a few glasses of wine and some snacks.  The snacks didn't come out quite right, but they did comp us some guacamole (the mystery item that appeared).  The guacamole and calamari were tasty. Service was friendly, but a little slow, considering we were sitting at the bar.  However, we weren't in a hurry, so it worked out ok.

From the desserts the chocolate bomb had a fun appearance-as they pour the melted chocolate, the hard outer covering melts revealing a delicious creamy inside. The tres leches was good. The cotton candy with caramel corn had a fun appearance as well. While the cotton candy was nice, the caramel corn was quite stale and frankly inedible. Service from our actual primary server was very attentive, as well as helpful. The gentleman pouring our waters was just about the clumsiest fellow there ever could be-there was water everywhere on our table, napkins, and sometimes our personally effects. Overall this would be a nice place to take a group, especially if they are out-of-towners. We felt that the overall experience took a very long time, possibly related to the fact that our group is larger, and it was Saturday night as well. After the almost 3 hours this dinner took, some of us were too tired to go out after, which was going to be a big part of our night.  I wouldn't personally return again, but I think it would be a fun experience for newcomers.",0.9879,0.799,0.151,0.05,0.48667388167388176

I requested in the notes section for it to be extra special for my daughter's birthday and they far exceeded my expectations.

I had been here before and enjoyed the food and the fun decor so I felt it was a good choice to take my daughter. The food was outstanding and so was the service. Oscar was our server and made our night extra special. His food recommendations were on point and even though we were there close to closing time, him and the rest of the staff did not make us feel rushed at all and made sure we were well taken care of.

2016-02-21,5.0,"After Da Bulls game my friend Kim and I continued my belated birthday celebration by going to Carnivale to grab a bite to eat.  I did go there once before many years ago but we ate outside as it was summertime and didn't really get to appreciate the full magnitude of what I consider to be one of my favorite dining experiences.  First of all I want to start by saying if you have never been to Carnivale you need to experience it.  Carnivale in every way is a first class experience.  Everything from the restaurant ambiance, to the food and service is stellar.   Carnival is located on Fulton street right off of the Kennedy expressway in a building that looks like a converted warehouse.  The outside has large colored letters with the name of the restaurant that can be seen from the expressway.  There is a smaller building on the side that was an add on to the main building that serves as an entrance.  As you enter Carnivale you go upstairs into a hall your eyes are drawn to the black and white striping on the ceiling.  The corridor is lined with wood paneling and artwork.  As you turn the corner and continue down the hallway where there is a continuation of the wood paneling and artwork.  you come into a beautiful large reception/bar area.  The bar itself is a large curved bar very tastefully decorated with wood panels & granite countertop.  Behind the bar there is a full height display of all the liquor available displayed on glass shelves & mirrored walls behind the shelves.  The lighting in this area is very tastefully done with glass chandeliers, candles on the bar and down lights above the glass shelves that illuminate the shelves with the liquor displayed for all to see. From there you go into a large colorful 2 story dining area.  This area is spectacular with a whole array of items to catch your eye.  The lighting is so cool.  They have checkered lighting panels on the ceiling with a whole color assortment that are back lit & pendant type light fixtures wrapped in an assortment of colored fabrics that give a nice soft lighting effect & bring a beautiful color arrangement into the room that catch your eyes.  There also colored wall sconces wrapped in the same motif of colored fabrics.  The walls are also colored in multicolored vertical color stripes with an assortment of pieces of art decorating the walls.   After we were seated we waited for our server to come and take our order.  This was a little and the only glitch in the evening.  It seems like the area where we were seated was straddling two servers so not knowing neither one came to take our order.  Once this was brought to their attention Sharon (manager) came over a apologized profusely for the mix up.  She was a very sweet lady and as far as I'm concerned no harm no foul on what was an incredible dining experience. Oh yeah the food.  Well it was getting late and I needed to be up at 4am (yuk) the next morning so we didn't eat.  YEAH RIGHT just kidding.  We decided to keep it light and since Kim had been there a number of times I let her do the ordering.  She did a great job everything was delicious.  We ordered 4 appetizers which proved to me more then enough and had left overs to boot.   * Guacamole - the seasoning was awesome * Shrimp Quesadillas - Very simple yet very good, cheese, shrimp, arugula, chipotle and tortillas, melts in your mouth. * Ropa Vieja - Braised Brisket with sweet plantains, malanga, aji Amarillo, aioli and queso fresco in miniature hard shell tacos *Tacos de Pescado - This was by far my favorite dish.    This had fried tempura cod, vigoron slaw (lime & cabbage slaw), & chipotle aioli.  OMG to die for.  The flavoring the crunch of the tempura cod and vigoron slaw.  I savored every bite of this dish. They also brought a glass filled with caramel corn with a paper stem and cotton candy with a little birthday candle. (Nice touch).  Unfortunately I didn't touch it as I am trying to cut sugar from my diet and lose weight.  It didn't go to waste though I gave it to 4 girls sitting at the table next to me. (2 wanted it & 2 didn't) Would I go back again NAH.  Are you F--in kidding me I would go back in a heart beat.  Everything about this restaurant from the ambiance to the food is stellar.  Thanks Kim for a great evening",0.9973,0.835,0.125,0.04,0.5083719135802469

They were smart and offered signature cocktails (pre mixed for quick service) and tray passed appetizers (could have used better timing in the service, seemed a little sporadic) and dinner was family style rather than buffet. Banquet staff was quick to clear plates and make sure you had cocktails.  Decor is gorgeous and the bar looks like a fun place to go.

2016-02-19,1.0,"This is a very long and detailed review. This was not my first time there and my sister have been there on numerous occasions.   My wife called on Valentine's Day and she told me that she was able to get a table for 4 for dinner here. There were 4 of us, my sister, her boyfriend, my wife, and I. We got there and ordered drinks at the bar while we waited for our table to be ready. Each one of us got a drink so that was 4 drinks. When we sat down, the waiter explained the menu and asked us if we were ok on drinks. We said we were ok because we had drinks from the bar still. He left and did not clear the wine glasses off the table. So there are 4 empty wine glass occupying the small table. I ordered the beef tartare to start out with, It came out and looked very nice and a big portion. Upon taking a bite, it was not edible! There was so much salt in there it was as I ate a spoon full of salt. That was the 2nd thing that went wrong. The waiter was busy playing by the computer so did not noticed that we had finished all our drinks. I had to call someone over to get our waiter. I then told him to please take this back because it was not edible and to please clear the table of the wine glasses and empty cups. We then ordered entree. I had the skirt steak, my sister the tenderloin, my wife the paella , and my sister's boyfriend the pork shoulder. Out of everything there, my skirt steak was the only thing that was flavorful and tasted decent. The tenderloin had no salt on it and tasted very bland. The paella was very wet and lack flavor also. I also asked that he make the paella spicy and he said he will bring my hot sauce. Hot sauce did not come out and I had to call him over to ask for him to bring it out. The pork shoulder was very bad also. My sister's boyfriend eats EVERYTHING, and he did not even finish 1/4 of the shoulder. We had 2 steaks so that means you get 2 steak knives, right?? I mean how else am I suppose to cut the steak? Steak knives were never brought out I had to call him over AGAIN to ask for steak knives. He then gave everyone steak knives, even my wife who had a rice dish. Did he wanted her to cut the rice with the knife? We then ordered dessert. Of course something else went wrong. The dessert I wanted was out. So there goes that. We did enjoy ice cream, which was the highlight of the night. We then got the check. The waiter came over and explained to me that he took of the tartare because I returned it....well that's obvious because why would I pay for it? It's a given. He put it on the bill as a ""comp"", as if hes' comping me the tartare that I did not eat.....This is the ONE night you get it RIGHT and NOTHING was done right. The restaurant was NOT busy they had plenty of open tables. I then went to pick up my car to get my wife. I was parked in front and my wife came out and the valet guy blocked us in. I honked my horn as to why are you blocking me in??? He then came out of the car and starred me down and said NO he's not gonna move. WOW. Nothing went right and I could had better food and service going to chili's or TGI.  There were at least 8 things that went wrong that night, all of which could had be avoided. Service -5, food 1, valet -5. I expected better service and quality of food from here. This was not my first time and it seems like it will be my last.

The pasta dish was rather boring and the garlic mashed potatoes seemed just out of place. I loved the home made cotton candy we had for dessert, along with a cheese cake tartlet. I haven't had cotton candy in years. It was fun!!! My only gripe was that it was incredibly noisy. I don't enjoy having to literally yell to the person next to me. I guess noisy is the price of success, or poor acoustics.",0.9574,0.72,0.184,0.095,0.5416666666666666
2016-01-24,1.0,"Went over for Restaurant Week, for which this restaurant was most definitely unprepared. The special menu was south of underwhelming, and it seems to me that whoever runs this place has missed the memo on what the purpose of Restaurant Week is. From my point of view, it's certainly not to make your patrons feel unwelcome, which is exactly how we felt the entire time we were there. From the utterly confused hostesses, who spent about 5 minutes talking to one another, trying to figure out what to do with us (despite the fact we had made a reservation, which they had called earlier to confirm), through the very inattentive and  borderline curt waiter (Juan), and to the runners who would just toss a plate on our table, without even uttering a word. Even our glasses sat empty, even though we had both made it clear that we are ""thirsty"" and we are ready to spend some money. I understand when a place is busy, and I have absolutely no problem waiting. But this was an entirely different ballgame. I'd like to call them rude, but... it's kind of hard to use any adjective to describe an interaction that basically didn't exist. Everyone seemed annoyed and unprofessional. I am most certain that the place will continue to be successful without our patronage. There are plenty of people, even in a demanding food scene like Chicago, who settle for mediocrity.

A hostess got our names, got on the computer and started answering calls. 3 of the hostesses were too busy in their own conversation to be bothered. 5 minutes (literally) later another hostess finally looked us up and took us to our table. We stood there in front of 4 hostesses and a manager for 5 minutes without a word to us!  Our server was Juan. He clearly wanted nothing to do with us. From the moment we sat down, we felt unwelcome. We got our cocktails and ordered food. My date ordered off the restaurant week menu and I the regular. We didn't see Juan after that until our drinks sat empty for 15 minutes or so we finally caught his attention to order another round. My water glass sat empty the rest of the dinner. Food runners brought our appetizer, salad, and entrees. Each time they were quickly dropped off haphazardly without a word. Juan never checked on us. We told him we didn't want the dessert the restaurant week meal came with at the beginning of the meal. He plopped it on the table amidst our empty drink glasses again and quickly walked away.  We had to get his attention again for our check. 25 minutes later we had our credit card receipts and were able to leave. The dinner took over 2.5 hours yet all of our courses came within 5-7 minutes of the appetizer.  I was a server for years so I understand being busy or having an off day but the service ruined this experience. It was a joke.  Carnivale was participating in restaurant week yet they were totally unprepared. The menu consisted mostly of things not normally offered on their normal menu. Little variety and no thought seemed to be put into the preparation.  The food was decent. We had the baked goat cheese, Amazonian chopped salad, the Scallops, and the Chicken Crillo.

As you probably expect with that, no one got refills in a timely manner either. We were never given steak knives with our dinner and were expected to eat with butter knives until I brought it to his attention.

Tucked away in a non descript part of the west loop, right off 90 and randolph, this unassuming looking building is beautiful on the inside and has been decorated to remind you of a circus.

Lots of great latin options. My recommendations are the following. Ropa Vieja - their most popular item. Kinda like barbacoa, this is very flavorful beef with a spicy component. Guacamole. Skirt Steak. For dessert, order the cotton candy to share for the table... you could order the ice cream cake which is a gigantic 3 layer cake with passion fruit cake, mango and guava flavors... this was maybe a little overwhelming but if you love fresh flavors then you would probably like it.",0.9821,0.832,0.168,0.0,0.5612244897959184

We made reservations a week in advance for 9 people. The dinner started off fine; it is a cool venue with elaborate decorations and colors. The goat cheese appetizer was very good. Our waiter definitely had a second agenda and we were clearly not a top priority for him. He was very rude and made a point to ignore our table - by serving other, smaller tables of two people around us but never stopping by our table. There was a full hour that went by when we never saw our waiter. There were other servers, however, that refilled our water glasses and cleared the plates. I had to order an appetizer from one of them because we couldn't flag down our waiter! When our food arrived it was decent but very underwhelming considering the price. When the plates were cleared we waited another 20 minutes with an empty table before we saw our waiter again. He finally came - abruptly with the check - and was taken aback when we asked for a dessert menu, in which case he replied, ""There is a two hour time limit on this table and another party waiting for you to leave."" I was shocked and offended, especially since we had been very respectful the entire time despite the horrible service. The reason our dinner took so long was because he was no where to be found, yet we were being blamed and cut short of the experience.  I will definitely not be returning because I value good service and I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone in the city.",0.508,0.727,0.145,0.129,0.6172605363984676

2016-01-04,1.0,"I - along with five friends - dined at Carnivale Jan. 2 and left feeling incredibly disappointed and frustrated. From terrible service to an incorrect bill (by a couple hundred dollars) I would not recommend Carnivale to anyone.  Let's start with drinks ... on average, it took 15 - 20 minutes for our drinks to arrive. Unfortunately I made the mistake of ordering a second glass of wine after appetizers and before dinner. My wine didn't arrive until well after I had finished my meal. And a friend's second margarita never came. Not to worry, though, we were charged for the margarita that never came. Onto dinner ... which was expensive and underwhelming (especially considering the prices). Three people in my party ordered the same meal. When our dinner was served, they were each given the wrong meal. It took at least 10 - 12 minutes for our server to notice that half of the table was without their food. She said ""where's your food?"" After explaining what happened, she said ""oh, ok"" and walked away. Never once did she utter ""I'm sorry."" We were all nearly finished our dinner by the time our three friends received their correct entrees.  The bill ... not only was it expensive, we were overcharged by almost $200! That's right - they included the margarita that never came and the three entrees we didn't order! And, they doubled the service charge. I beg of you -- if you visit Carnivale, please thoroughly review your bill. After an all-around disappointing experience, I decided to let the manager know about our experience. Maxx Kleiner, who said he was the manager in charge, also never said ""I'm sorry."" Not once. I was shocked. Instead, he held my bill in his hand and said ""tell me what's wrong, specifically."" Then he said ""I refuse to take accountability for this."" You could have literally knocked me over with a feather.  Maxx had to correct our second bill because it was still wrong. Then, he removed the two desserts from the bill as a sign of good faith ... or something.  To Maxx and all the servers that work at Carnivale: know that the words ""I'm sorry"" go an incredibly long way. Take ownership for your mistakes. And even though you don't believe the customer is always right - clearly - know that when a customer has a terrible experience that she will tell all of her friends and write about it on Yelp. If you want to have a nice dinner out, don't waste your time, money and frustrations on Carnivale. I will never be returning.",-0.9329,0.814,0.077,0.109,0.5943452380952381

The food was pretty good.  For appetizers, the ropa vieja was very tasty, as was the octopus.  The tuna ceviche was OK ... but not particularly special.  The tenderloin churrasco was very good and well cooked.  Sangria (by the glass only) was quite good ... but beware the bar up front ($50 for two double Ketel Ones).",0.9701,0.847,0.117,0.035,0.4875534851621807

However, once we were greeted by our server, Antonio, and started getting our food, we now have no reservations about our love for this place! We ordered a Ropa Vieja for an appetizer, which was these really good brisket mini tacos. Definitely teased our appetites because we were so excited waiting for our main courses. I ordered a paella and my boyfriend ordered the short rib steak, though we both kind of shared the entrees. Both were really delicious, and I would definitely go back again. I'm big on paella having that crust at the bottom, and this one definitely had it. Neither of us ordered alcohol that night just because we weren't feeling it, but the tables around us all had really fun looking drinks! At the end of our meal, I really wanted the organic cotton candy since I saw a lot of others with it at their table.

It has a vintage feel with modern accents.  The desserts were decent, we had the chocolate dome and tres leches.  They also were very careful with my egg and dairy allergy. The descriptions don't always make sense on the menu.  They say one dessert has an espresso fondant, but after inquiring further it wasn't actually fondant at all, but instead was a mousse.  The drinks were OK but for $10.50 for a ""signature"" mojito which was more ice than alcohol and blood orange flavor.  The rum flight for $18 was worth it, but everything else was subpar especially for scratch made drinks. For appetizers the octopus was delicious and the guacamole was standard, the chips served with the guac were excellent. For entrees we got the paella, which was mostly rice and shrimp, the mussels and clams (about 6 of each) were extremely small and disappointing. My wife and mother-in-law got the arrachera (a signature dish), but the rice was lackluster, the sauces were bland, and the cut of meat was not trimmed or prepared properly.  For $32, I could make better using skirt steak from Tony's.   My father-in-law got the scallops, which was 3 large scallops for $30 with minimal sides, a baby salad underneath.  Definently not worth $30!! My brother-in-law got the NY Strip with bone marrow and veal marmalade, for $42 it was the best of anything else we got.  I guess in order to get a high quality meal here you need to choose the $40+ entrees. Overall for $60/person I would not return to this place.  The seasonings and quality didn't equal the price tag. Kudos that they have an outdoor roof garden where they harvest their herbs and they support local farms, but in the end the quality doesn't equal the price tag.  Next time we will just buy 10lbs of king crab, some mussels, shrimp, and clams and a few Ny strips and make a better meal at home for 25% of the cost there.

We were seated in one of the side rooms which felt private and cozy although I really liked the feel of the main dining room with the vaulted ceilings. For appetizer we ordered the (4) Ceviche sampler (ok) and Ropa Vieja (loved it!). Luckily our server brought some chips to eat with the ceviche on request at no charge. The ceviche is served sashimi style. I'm used to having the seafood chopped up into small pieces and all mixed together and eaten with chips but that's just me. For drinks we ordered the coconut mojito (didn't like it) Carnivale Tequila flight (never again - tasted like rubbing alcohol to me - never got the hints of sweetness?) and beer (basic.) For dinner we ordered the arrachera (ok), sweet plantains (yummy), chicken Milanese (delicious - the best plate!) & grilled salmon (good.) For dessert our server, who btw provided very good service gave my hubby complimentary organic cotton candy in a glass with caramel corn (both made there) & lit candle (very nice touch!) He recommended we have the chocolate dome for dessert and it was to die for! It's a ball of chocolate ganache filled with white and dark chocolate mousse, strawberry sorbet and fresh strawberries. When the server brings it over he pours hot Mexican chocolate over the ganache and the whole thing starts to open up - OMG. Awesome dessert!

2015-08-12,5.0,"Carnivale had been on my list for a long time and I finally went with the girlfriend the other week.  Carnivale is huge, the dining room is massive and has the upstairs section overlooking the entire dining room. There's also a very nice bar / waiting section in front with an outdoor patio. I assume you can order the full menu out there which would make that area a fantastic option. My girlfriend and I each got drinks and we split the Ropa Vieja appetizer. The Ropa Vieja was great, kinda what carnivale is known for as far as appetizers. Some great brisket and sweet plantains made for a very decadent and tender set of tacos. Would highly recommend and definitely get again. For entrees, we split the short rib steak and the boliche (pork loin). Both were absolutely wonderful.  The short rib steak had some really flavorful rub on the outside and was cooked to perfection. It was then smothered in a chile reduction which really complemented the short rib. Made for very tender meat which was full of flavor and, somehow, not full of fat. Definitely recommend.  The boliche was maybe my favorite. Too often pork lacks flavor and is overcooked/dry. Not the boliche, this was perfectly cooked, tender, and very flavorful. They stuff a column of chorizo into the bottom of the pork loin and the flavor really spreads throughout the pork. As good as the meat is, the highlight for me may have been the yucca mofongo surrounding the meat. It was so complex with interesting texture, bits of chewiness and a slight crunch while somehow looking like mashed potatoes. Very complex flavors as well - absolutely loved it. My only complaint is that while I didn't necessarily feel any one dish was overpriced, somehow the total price for the whole dinner (almost $120) was too much. Next time I go back, I might pass on the drinks I think so as to enjoy the meal just as much but with a cheaper price tag.",0.9847,0.864,0.127,0.009,0.5440579710144927

To start off, you can never go wrong with Ropa Vieja as your appetizer. As for their main dishes, their Arrachera, Salmon, Beef Tenderloin Churrasco, and most recently, their Paella, are all most try/have! The only one dish, I was not impressed with at all, is their Fideo (House made pasta, mushroom ragout, 60 minute egg). Tasted bland and straight out of a box. Their cocktail drinks are always on point. Personal favorite: their Mojitos. The main ballroom area is grand and impressive, and offers a unique dining experience for everyone.  High ceilings, colorful walls, extremely spacious, and decorated with vibrant colors.

It doesn't come with a lot of bread, and I didn't ask for more because I don't particularly mind eating cheese/meat without it, but I'm sure they can provide you some if you just ask. The drinks here are also pretty good, although they are on the pricier side. Other than that, everything is just okay. I do like the decor, it's super fun, but the dim lighting can get annoying.

Even though I visited on a Saturday evening, the restaurant was only about half full and service was extremely fast.  My table ordered several items to share. We tried two appetizers: calamari and ropa vieja. The calamari was a bit too sweet for my liking, but the ropa vieja was phenomenal. It consisted of a subtly sweet, crisp taco shell filled with meat that was bursting in flavor. For entrees, we had the paella, scallops, and the short rib steak. I was initially really excited for the paella, but it turned out to be just average. After we finished all the seafood in it, the remaining rice didn't taste like anything special. The scallops and short ribs were pretty good, and they were served with unique sides as well. Lastly, we ordered the Carnivale ice cream cake for dessert. While the ice cream flavors were cool to try once, I have to say that I would still prefer Neopolitan over the vanilla-guava-pistachio combination. The ice cream was sandwiched between layers of chocolate cake, but I wasn't impressed by the cake at all--it was too dry and dense, resembling the chocolate cookies in a supermarket ice cream sandwich. Overall, it was an enjoyable meal and I believe this restaurant has mastery of Latin American cuisine.

When the waiter came over again, we asked if there was dairy and he said no and it wasn't until after I SHOWED him the cheese that he realized what he'd done. He quickly took the food to the back and the foodrunner brought a new dish but the damage was done. My brother was in bad shape and we had to send the food back so we could leave ASAP. The WORST part about all of this, aside from my brother's birthday dinner being ruined and him being in physical agony, was the manager and how he handled the whole thing.  He came over and said ""I heard something happened to you guys so I came to hear your side of the story."" (not a good way to approach the situation) So my brother, very kindly and patiently explained what happened, mind you if this was anyone else they'd FLIP a SHIT and walk out or even sue for negligence. But my brother being in the industry was super nice about it. After explaining it all, the manager said ""what would you like me to do? Take some drinks off your bill?""  Wow. Anyone in their right mind, anyone who knows customer service or even common decency should know that when you eff up someone's entire meal, leaving them in physical agony, you COMP the BILL! this dude brought us a bill! Yes he took off some of the food items, but the fact that all of this happened and my brother is sitting there fighting the urge to projectile vomit and having to deal with this BS about the bill was absolutely mind-blowing. My brother being the decent person he is even PAID the bill because he just wanted to get out of there as soon as possible because he was so ill at this point. They clearly don't take food allergies seriously. They have a HUGE language barrier/miscommunication problem between their staff, they have waiters who don't know the damn menu and what's in the food they're serving, and they nickel and dime customers even when they trigger a very serious and painful food allergy.  For those of you who have serious food allergies or who are big on customer service, I promise you that this place isn't worth the money! I literally made a Yelp account to warn all of you.  And if there was a 0 star rating, I would give it that. Hell, I'd give negative stars if I could!",-0.9833,0.776,0.092,0.132,0.5932882395382395

We decided to surprise the old man with brunch at Carnival.  As soon as we walked through the door, we were amazed with the decor and live music.  We were seated, ordered drinks and guacamole.  As we began to dig in, we discovered a large chunk of the avocado shell in the guacamole and over ripe, dark bitter chunks in our dip.  But, that's not the worst part.  When they brought my son's entree, carnitas chilaquiles, they had forgotten to add the meat!  I ordered the chicken and waffles, and had to track down the waiter not only to return my son's meal, but to ask him to please bring me the chipotle syrup that was supposed to accompany my meal.  Who eats chick & waffles without syrup?  Half way through the meal, he brings the syrup and another plate of carnitas chiaquiles.  This time, there was meat in the dish, but no crema.  Once again we called the waiter over and told him of the issue we were having.  He brought out a small dish of crema.  Since our expectations were running kind of high, this experience was rather disappointing.  How do you forget to put meat into a dish that has meat in the name and then drop the ball after being given a second shot?",-0.6434,0.888,0.049,0.063,0.5296329365079365

We were brought upstairs as the lower dining room was pretty full.  We started with apps: Ropa vieja & calamari.  The ropa vieja consisted of 5 small tacos. The meat was tender & pretty good, although slightly greasy. The calamari was probably the best I've had in a while. Slightly crispy with an Asian fusion twist, a little sweet & a little spicy. Definitely the highlight of the meal. As we were enjoying our drinks (carnivale martini was pretty delish) & apps, they were moving tables around, which was pretty obnoxious because they scraped the ground like nails on a chalkboard.   Anyway, for my entree, I chose the Arracherra & for $30, I expected to be blown away. I wasn't. It was okay, but nothing spectacular.  Finally, we decided to try the dessert & chose the carnivale ice cream cake. Um, no. The cake was dry & it tasted a little like freezer burn.

2015-05-17,2.0,"My girlfriend and I decided to try something new for a night out. We were both really excited to try Carnivale. We made reservations for 8. We showed up right at 8 and we were told we would have to wait a half hour. What is the point of making reservations if you make people still wait? I can understand a few minutes to get a table ready. I have NEVER had to wait a half hour to get a table when I had made reservations. We finally got our table at 8:33. I realized it was a Friday night and they were busy. But you aren't a new place. You know it's going to be busy. You need to prepare better and if you can't seat your reservations it means you have given out too many reservations. Once we were seated it took forever to get a waiter. I asked the waiter about the tequila flights and when he tried to sell us the more expensive tequilas I went to tell him I like the cheaper ones better (I do, I like the non aged clear tequilas much better than the aged, more expensive tequilas he was trying to sell us), but he cut me off and told me he ""knows his tequila"". I took it as very snobbish. We did not get the flight.  We did get two apps. My girlfriend liked the ceviche but I thought the seafood in it was very plain and all I could taste was the sauce. The goat cheese was very good. For dinner I ordered the skirt steak and my girlfriend ordered the scallops. The scallops were amazing. They were the best scallops I've ever had, but they only give you 3. That never would have filled me up. Wildfire's scallops aren't quite as good but they give you a much biggerr plate. My steak was good, but the sauces lacked flavor and honestly I've had skirt steak just as good at my neighborhood Mexican place for half the price.  Their drinks are really expensive, but that is expected for a downtown restaurant. My first drink was the cotton candy martini. It isn't nearly as sweet as you would expect, but it was good. I then asked the waiter if their margarita or their caiparinha was better. The waiter said the caiparinha. I am very skeptical of caiparinhas. I have been to Brasil and had real caiparinhas. My step mom is Brasilian. My dad learned how to make a real caiparinha in Brasil and American restaurants just don't make them right, but I decided to give it a shot. I didn't expect it to be genuine, but it wasn't even good. It wasn't real at all and it did not taste very good.

My entrée was the arrachera - skirt steak cooked a perfect medium rare atop rice and black beans with a chimichurri sauce.  No complaints on this one, other than maybe a little heavy on the salt, but that's pretty normal for skirt steak dishes.

2015-05-15,1.0,"My experience here was disappointing. I made reservations a month in advance for my boyfriend's birthday. We arrived on time and were seated in the furthest room at furthest table in a corner next to a table of 12 people. Being a table of two next a huge group we couldn't hear each other talk. Not that it is the other table's fault they were enjoying themselves, as they absolutely should, but the restaurant shouldn't seat a table of two right next to a table of 12. I would understand if the restaurant was very busy and had no other tables available, but there were several (more than 10) available tables in the main dining room and at least four open tables in the room we were in. We then sat at our table for a solid 20 minutes with no waiter in sight, so I went to the front desk to complain. They promptly walked over with me changed my table, got the waiter, and gave us guac and chips as an apology. After that I wasn't going to write a bad review, in my mind the situation was completely rectified and I thought the restaurant was very accommodating! The service after that was good and the evening went fine. However the next morning when I looked at my credit card bill, I saw that they run my card for not just my charges but another table. They charged my card for an additional $424.32.  So I called the next morning and talked to a male manager. He was apologetic, and told me that he was positive it was a mistake and he would call me the next day to make sure the charges did not hit my card (since it was still pending). He never called me back the next day, so I called them and talked to a female manager. She was apologetic, and actually went to the accounting department to find out if it was going to hit my card. She said that the waiter realized that he incorrectly charged my card that night and reversed the charges. So it wasn't actually going to go through. Most waiters tell you when they do that so you don't have to go through all of this calling back and forth. So she promised me a gift card, asked me for my address, and went through the whole 9. Did I EVER get that gift card? NO!!! This experience happened on April 4th and it is now May 15th. I gave this restaurant plenty of time to do their do-diligence and they couldn't even do that.  On to the food since that's what reviews are supposed to be about. The short rib tacos are amazing, out of this world good. However, the skirt steak I ordered medium was not medium more like medium rare and I personally don't like cilantro and that's really the flavor of the steak, ,must be in the marinate. My boyfriend ordered the ribs and they were burnt to a crisp. Not sure if that's the style Our sides were really good. Truffle potatoes and quesadillas. Also the Carnivale cake SOOO good!

2015-05-10,3.0,"Finally checked out that colorful restaurant we so oft see driving underneath Fulton Market. Reservations for two were easy to score a day in advance. Valet was quick and relatively inexpensive, putting us back only $7. Professional and hospitable front-of-the-house had us seated only minutes after checking.  A quick once over of the beer and cocktail menu shed light on some serious price gouging, which carried over into our dining experience. APPS WERE GREAT. We tried the Fried Calamari and Ropa Vieja Taco appetizers. Calamari were solid, breading was perfect, and the sweet and spicy, almost Asian influenced dressing was a perfect combo with the accompanying carrot slaw. The calamari weren't fishy or rubbery, a sad sight seen all too often. The Ropa Vieja Tacos were juicy as all get out, unfortunately a little greasy. The meat was tender, queso was underlying yet complimentary, and a spicy heat seemed to complete this fairly well-rounded app. Both the Calamari and Ropa Vieja were the perfect size for a party of two. DINNER WAS MEH! For our overpriced entrees, we went with the Paella and Arracherra, as well as a side of Brussels Sprouts and Cauliflower. Both came out pretty quickly, which was certainly welcome, however the Paella was way overdone, and the Brussels were near raw. The Paella was very dry, and an excess of overcooked, crunchy, greasy rice totally killed it for me.  The mussels, clams, shrimp, calamari, and chorizo were cooked well, but they skimped on every one of them. The dish literally had two pieces of sausage, a handful of cocktail shrimp, and one fully intact jumbo shrimp. For $30, I basically received a Latin American rice mash.  The Arracherra was a bit better, but nowhere near its price tag. Cooked to order, it still remained a bit sinewy and mostly under seasoned; until the Chimichurri sauce kicked in. The accompanying rice and beans were bland, however lightly inspired by the sweet red onion. CARNIVALE ICE CREAM CAKE WAS AVERAGE. The cake itself was moist, but the ice creams seemed freezer burned. Out of the three, the pistachio was the only cold ingredient worthwhile; the vanilla and lemon curd offered nothing. All in all, I price tag around $140 for two apps, two entrées, a dessert cake, and three drinks. Service was friendly yet slow at times. Ticket times were quick throughout, which unfortunately resulted in a rushed product lacking quality control. Very contradictory restaurant...quick yet slow, tasty yet bland, motivated yet uninspired. Probably won't be back for a while...  :' (",0.9887,0.839,0.126,0.035,0.577929724596391

He even enjoyed the seasonal pie (key lime pie), which he's only orders when we're in Florida. Next time we're there, I'll have their organic cotton candy with their house made caramel corn for dessert. I figured since I had the cotton candy martini having it for dessert would be overkill.

2015-04-30,2.0,"I wanted to like this place.When you walk in they have a creative,  fun, flamboyant environment with great service but the value and food isn't worth the price they put on their dishes. You can have a great time her otherwise. The Rope vieja was hyped up, nothing too special about it. The plantains kind of give it the flavor. Beyond that, not sure why people fell in love with it so much. The guacamole is just alright, I would suggest getting the smaller version of it. For my entree I got the $27 overpriced Lechon Asado, I have had this dish several times for half the price if that. So when I purchased this one I had high hopes of something that would blow me away or why else charge that much? I don't mind paying for greatness but it didn't live up to that. Once again I thought it was heavy reliant on the plantains for the flavor, the meat didn't have enough seasoning for my taste. I skipped dessert, they are all around $9 though if you're interested. Overall Fun place, but overpriced for dishes you may have tried elsewhere and paid half. They don't use a ton of spice, of enough seasoning for my taste.

2015-04-20,3.0,"I have been to carnivale multiple times. I really enjoy the food. It is consistently good. The guacamole which appears popular is my least favorite thing on the menu. It is bland and boring. The fish tacos are some of the best I've ever had and the skirt steak is always a winner. I love the mojitos but they are different depending on the bartender. Some nights they are perfect with a great balance. Other times they have so much rum it is overpowering.  I always sit in the lounge and I love my servers. They are friendly and personable. I really do not like the hostesses at Carnivale. They are rude and have no idea about good customer service. For example I had a 8:30 reservation and arrived at 8:10. I told the hostess to seat me in the lounge (every 2 person table was empty). They said it would be a 15-20 minute wait. I understand because I'm early. At 8:35 the host proceeds to seat me in the dining room. When I inform him of the mix up he tells the hostess at the computer and his response was ""oh, well I gave that table away"". After a short wait I finally get seated in the lounge, which is still empty. No apology for the mix up. 4-5 stars for the food. 4 stars for the servers. 4 stars for atmosphere (music can get really loud in the lounge and makes having a conversation impossible). 1 star for the hostesses. They are the first interaction and I've never had a good experience with them.

2015-04-11,5.0,"Honestly, I saw the photos with huge cotton candy and I want to try this place out when I came to Chicago for visit since I am a huge dessert fan. And this place was beyond my expectation.  The interior of the restaurant is colorful with a high ceiling. The service was great. We started off with the coconut mojito, and it was so amazing. The right amount of sweetness made it really refreshing and minty. (a must try) For appetizer, we had the Ropa Vieja (like a mini braised beef taco). It's one of the best mini tacos I ever had. The taco was crispy and the braised beef was well-seasoned and juicy. (a must try) For entree, we ordered the Arrachera and the Paella. The arrachera was a skirt steak. It was super tender and juicy and the sauce made it even better! The paella was pretty good but the only flaw was that shrimp was a little over cooked. Th portion of the two dishes were large. For dessert, we ordered the cotton candy and the ice cream cake. Both of them are huge. The cotton candy was really photogenic and it's house-made. Not only the cotton candy by itself was amazing, and it also came with some caramelized popcorn and that was also delicious. The ice cream cake has three layers of ice-cream: vanilla, guava and pistachio and in between the layers was chocolate sponge cake. The guava ice-cream layer was my favorite: it was not overly sweet Hint: Personal preference, If you eat the chocolate cake with the ice-cream, you can't really taste the ice-cream because the ice-cream is bland compared with the chocolate so I recommend you to eat them separately.

2015-04-11,4.0,"Overall a great must try restaurant. Great food, creative menu, delicious drinks. The decorations inside are a little over the top, and the place is enormous. There are multiple sitting areas, there is a bar/drink room, a main room, side rooms/curtained areas for large groups, and a back room with a few tables that is very very quiet compared to the loud atmosphere of most of the restaurant. I was slightly bothered by the choice of music, there was alot of popular music remixes which reminded me of a club more than a Latin American fusion restaurant. As for the food, the Ropa Vieja is incredibly delicious, and anyone who eats meat should try it. It was juicy sweet and the texture of the taco shells were not too soft but not too hard. The salmon was okay, but it didn't go very well with the sauce and the carrot slices on top. I ordered the Arrachera, which was really quite high-quality and well cooked meat. However, the rice and beans underneath were rather salty and so I ended up only eating a few forkfuls of the rice. But the sauce and onions on top complemented the steak very nicely. The cotton candy drink is really fun (they pour the drink over a glass with cotton candy which dissolves into the drink) and I could tell it was popular with a lot of the tables. Overall I would recommend this place. It's quite unique and is a great place if your looking to explore new and delicious things.",0.991,0.795,0.182,0.024,0.5258491508491507

2015-04-04,3.0,"While the meal was great I thought that the over all experience was lacking due to the services staff. Our plates were cleared before we were finished with our appetizer without being asked if we were done, and while I would not have been disappointed by this fact alone I found that the waiter was beyond pushy. Which annoyed me even more. I felt rushed through my whole meal, which would seem hard to do since we waited for a while for the food to get to us in the first place. The waiters etiquette was deplorable, as we finish our bottle of wine he pulled it from us and didn't bother to ask us if we'd like to buy another. It was a sad mistake on his part as our table was willing to buy a couple more. But then again when you're more concerned about pushing as many tables as possible, you forget that you could be making more money from the table you already have. I really hope that the next time I visit this restaurant I will have a little bit better of an experience. My partner really enjoys it and it's close to our office.

The restaurant decor is really, really cool. All the colors and dim lighting are very inviting. However, there was live music being played on-and-off throughout the meal, which was often too loud and made us shout to hear each other. When there wasn't music playing, they had some sort of belly dancer dancing around the dining room in a bejeweled bra and feather hat (something out of Vegas), which I actually enjoyed because she was quite good, but might not appeal to everyone.  When we first sat down, part of our group had already arrived. We must have waited at least fifteen minutes for the waiter to come and even take our drink orders. Then, once we ordered our food, we again were waiting for such a long time, and the restaurant was nowhere near full. There were six in our party, and FINALLY when the first five meals came out, the waiters mixed up who ordered what and we all had to switch plates. Someone in our group had requested their sandwich without bacon, and it came with bacon so she requested it remade. Then when they brought it out again, they gave it to the wrong person. Meanwhile, the sixth person in our group who ordered a SALAD was the last person to get there food, even after the sandwich was remade. The owner did apologize and comped the salad, which was appreciated.  My meal was actually really great. I ordered the omelette with pork sausage and a side of brussel sprouts and cauliflower. The omelette was amaazing. Loved the flavors. Every bite was tasty and completely delicious. It came with a variation on hash browns, more like potato medallions, which were very good; crisp on the outside  and soft and warm on the inside. The side dish was also very good. It was served in a sauce that was a little sweet for my taste, but still tasty. Someone in our group who ordered the burger was underwhelmed; said the fries were meh and the burger was just average.

They serve awesome fish: the grouper was divine. The ingredients are not the problem. The flavor profiles are, however. My college roommate makes the best guacamole and this Latin restaurant did  not best him. The steak was under seasoned. Also, their signature (ropa) appetizer was bland. I'll have to visit again and try some other dishes. For now, however, the cost compared to the taste earns Carnivale 3/5 stars.",0.9889,0.765,0.22,0.015,0.617702380952381
2015-03-04,4.0,"Unsurprisingly good. I've heard rave reviews from friends and have been meaning to try this place forever. I set a Sunday brunch reservation via Opentable. I got a phone call reminder and a request to confirm. However, when I called to confirm there was no one to pick up the phone. I called twice more before I finally reached a person. Getting to this location was a bit rocky from the Gold Coast area (two bus transfers) but when I finally got there the restaurant decor wowwed me! Getting seated was a tiny bit rocky because the computer system was being uncooperative but when we finally got seated, we were happy campers. The breakfast cocktails were well worth their prices and the food was great! I had a coupon that I received in the mail and it knocked down the price significantly.",0.9639,0.837,0.152,0.011,0.6921717171717171
2015-03-01,1.0,"Very disappointed with my experience last night. Had 10:30pm reservation, first off it took it 5 minutes to even be acknowledged at the hostess desk. Then it took another 5 minutes to get seated. Once seated the server comes to the table and says the kitchen closes at 11pm so I need to place your feed order first if you want to eat, then I'll come take your drink order.  Then literally 5 minutes later he comes back and says are you ready. At this point we place our food order and our drink order.  5 minutes later the appetizer arrives on the table. We paused waited a minute no drinks yet, so we started on our appetizer and sipped our water. Believe it or not drinks landed 10 minutes later after we finished the appetizer and actually had to ask our server for the drinks.  Literally  half way through the appetizer the main course landed.   I felt this entire experience was in fast forward. Not once during the dinner did the server stop and ask how the meal was or how our drinks were. Even worse  the bill landed immediately after the busses cleared the table. I was blown away that the bill landed before we even asked for it. We were even asked for dessert or a second round of drinks. Honestly I used to love this place, obviously not somewhere you want to go after 10 pm because the management and staff just want to go home. It appears the kitchen closes at 11pm and the bar at midnight. Found this quite surprising since the website, open table and yelp all show that they are open to 1am.   We were in and out in 45 minutes. Honestly for what we paid we should have just done a dinner. I will never return to Carnivale and I will not be recommending it anymore either.

2015-02-26,3.0,"My girlfriend and I came here for Valentine's Day and our feelings about the experience were mixed.  The great: we LOVED the decor and the *intended* festive ambiance of the restaurant (more on this later).  The good-ish: the food was definitely edible. I got the jumbo shrimp ($30) which were tasty and lived up to the ""jumbo"" modifier, however the dish contains only two of them, so I wouldn't recommend them to people with a ""healthy"" appetite.  The meh: My girlfriend ended up getting Brussels sprouts/cauliflower side ($7 and tasty if you like brussels sprouts) and the Amazonian chopped salad which was exactly what one would expect - a salad ($10).  She chose these dishes because she has many food allergies (including peas and snap peas) which significantly limited her choices since many of the entrees include paella which contains peas. It was difficult to discuss this with the waiter due to...  The bad-ish: the open dining area lends itself to a festive Latin style ambiance; however, on Valentine's Day, this did not make for a very romantic experience due to the cacophony of approximately 200 people all eating in the same area. The waiter was unable to hear my girlfriend as she explained her severe allergies (which is why she ended up defaulting to the salad) and we were unable to hear him as well.  Overall I would recommend this place to people looking for a festive Latin (yet elegant) experience, but would recommend that they avoid high volume days such as Valentine's Day.",0.4753,0.87,0.071,0.059,0.4943142857142857

But boy oh boy when you walk through the door it feels like you're transported to another country in a good way.  My texperience at this restaurant was fantastic except for one small detail. I write with my fiancé and I are friends were minutes behind us arriving in a separate car, the restaurant was extremely busy as it was a Saturday night at 7 PM, there was barely enough room to wait in the waiting area which is quite large when I went to her host and told him that our reservation was for seven he asked if our tire party was present I said they are minutes behind us we would like to be seated he's said to us we cannot feature party until everyone is here. Others walk past us with later reservations as we waited for our friends standing amongst a mob of people this was very annoying. our friends finally arrived in the rest of night went off splendid. We got a table that was not around too many people so we were not extremely crowded and it was an extremely busy dining room but our server was very good, The food was fantastic I tried their steak with chimichurri and au gratin potatoes which was one of the best steaks I've ever had and I've eaten steaks around the world. Their appetizers were great we have the mini tacos with braised beef fantastic and the drinks were also very good we try the pomegranate martinis all in all this was a fantastic dying experience the core the ceilings the beautiful textures will leave you with your job dropped at first glance. One slight downside was we were celebrating a birthday and told them about this prior to reservation and what they brought us for the birthday free dessert that most restaurants do was a small cup of popcorn with cotton candy on top I thought that after spending over $300 for dinner we could've maybe gotten a piece of cake for the birthday boy.

The pulled pork is really sweet with some sort of sweet barbecue sauce on it and then the sweet plantains add even more sweetness.

Paella: This dish was great but unfortunately there was one giant prawn shell/tail with THE ACTUAL PRAWN MISSING. So completely bummed out.  Skirt steak (arrachera): This was just okay, not as good as people mention. We ordered medium rare and the center of the steak was good but the ends were very overdone and very chewy.

We had to wait for our entire party to be seated which is a small annoyance. While I understand the need to do that on the weekend, the restaurant was still pretty empty.  To start, we split an order of the guacamole which was very tasty.  I ordered the al pastor pork belly empanada as the appetizer and the Criollo half chicken as the main. Everything was plated beautifully.  The food was otherwise tasty. The empanada was solid and I really enjoyed the aioli. My only complaint is that the chicken was a tad dry but it was offset by the jus. For dessert, I did the passion fruit cheese cake.  It was good but nothing special.  If it weren't for restaurant week, I'd probably skip that course.  [Note: they have a lot of gluten free options].

We took our seat and our waiter was very nice and not pushy at all. We had ordered a appetizer of calamari. This calamari was good but a little different with the sweet and sour sauce (which has a little more of a teriyaki flavor than sweet and sour).  My main course was the arrachera which the steak was ordered medium. The steak was warm, not overly hot but hot enough to eat. I can understand that this happens and is not something the bothers me, unless it is unreasonable, which this was not. The beans and rice were top notch and a great large portion of them as well. As a side we split hand cut French fries with smoked ketchup. These were very tasty fries. There was some kind of spice added to them that gave them a little kick, but nothing unbearable.

2015-01-31,4.0,"A big group of us had some last minute dinner plans on a Friday night and called up Carnivale to see if they had anything available for a group of 7. Surprisingly, they said the wait would only be 30 minutes, even though OpenTable didn't show anything all night for a group that size. When we got there, we checked in and just hung out in the lobby area. This part of the restaurant is actually pretty spacious and has a full bar, a few benches and tables, and a couple big screen TVs. After only 10 minutes, they called us and said our table was ready, which was a pleasant surprise. I thought for sure no good restaurants would accommodate a large group on a Friday night on such short notice.  Ambiance: When you walk into the main dining area, the first thing you notice is how beautifully decorated it is. The room was huge and a had a very open feel to it, with high ceilings spanning two levels. The decor itself all had very loud and vibrant colors. Even the ceiling itself was composed of multi-colored glass tiles and had swings hanging from it. I'm not usually the type to comment on the decor of a restaurant, but I gotta admit that Carnivale had a great fun and lively feel to their dining room. They sat us at a huge round table right in the center of the lower level. Drinks: Their drink menu had a ton of different types of cocktails and tequilas. I ordered the Caiprinha, which was made with some sort of Brazilian Rum. We also got some Xingu beer, which I haven't tried before. The beer was a heavier dark beer that went down very smooth.  Food: I thought everything we ordered was delicious. I especially loved all the meat dishes with the big and bold Latin flavors.   Ropa Vieja - These were mini tacos that were filled with braised beef and topped with aioli and cheese. Wow they were damn good. The meat was super juicy and tender, and each taco was filled to the top with meat. Then whatever sauce was on it and the cheese on top just made it even better. I could've eaten these all day. It's a must try.  Charcuterie platter - This was a huge board that had different types of cured meats and soft/hard cheeses. There were also nuts and grapes and a few pieces of toast. The actual meat and cheese items were very tasty and perfect for sharing. My only complaint would be that it didn't have enough toast/bread with it. I needed something to cut the super strong flavors of the meats and cheeses. Creek Stone Farm NY strip - Talk about a hearty dish. They literally brought out a frying pan with steak, bone marrow, and potatoes. I ate out of a freakin' frying pan haha. The steak itself was really good. The rub on this steak was crazy flavorful and the meat was so tender that my knife just cut right through it. It had just the right amount of char on the outside and it was topped with some sort of mix of herbs.  The bone marrow that came with it was really different from other bone marrow dishes I've tried at other places. Instead of a sweeter type of jam, this bone came covered in a really rich pureed type sauce that has a veal base and was more on the savory side. It was perfect because you had the bold flavor of that puree with the great fatty texture of the marrow. The only thing missing that I wish they had was some sort of toast or bread to spread it on.  The potato side that came with it was an au gratin style layered potato dish that had a really good buttery, onion-y flavor. It also helped that it was sitting in the same pan, soaking in all the juices from the steak. Ice cream cake - We all just shared a slice of ice cream cake, which was actually pretty huge. It had alternating layers of vanilla, pistachio, and some sort of fruit ice cream flavors.  I've been to Carnivale twice now, and haven't been disappointed either time. The atmosphere is fun, and the colorful decor is a sight to see. The food is delicious and it has a great balance of modern presentation but still with a heartiness that will satisfy your hunger.",0.9993,0.768,0.199,0.033,0.5739980158730158

It is a beautiful restaurant and the service was extremely fast the food was good but not ""slap yo mamma"" good for the price and portion size!!! I figured if Im paying $25 for chicken and mashed potatoes I'd better get more than 2 teaspoons of mashed potatoes right!!! That was the only problem with my dining experience. The real issue was with the way I was billed...my order came out to $82.33 I tipped 20% and used my debit card to pay. I wake up the next day with an alert from my bank showing the charges I did authorize plus a seperate charge for $264.10 from Carnivale. I was and still am speechless, Im not sure what happened but I contacted someone from management to find out why this happened and how. Of course she played dumb told me she didnt have any record of the charges and that if it is pending it should fall off by the end of the day. I didnt even know what that means...like total refusal to acknowledge a mistake made on their end. Apparently my card was swiped twice and was used to pay for another tables check. I understand things happen but to totally deny a big mistake like that, that could easily be fixed you claim to have no transaction history to reverse the charges and all you can do is offer me a $50.00 gift certificate for my inconvenience. Like WHAT did you hear me correctly!!! I ended up having to file a claim with my bank and my money still has not been returned to me I also sent this woman an email showing that on my end on my bank statement Carnivale charged me an additional $264.10 that I did not authorize she still wont even admit the waiter fucked up and swiped my card twice.

They apologized, took it back to the kitchen and brought it back to her within 30 seconds (I'm pretty sure they just scraped it off and brought out the same plate)",0.9951,0.735,0.237,0.028,0.505750609543713

Plantains and braised beef heaven in mini plantain taco form!  Although the menu changes seasonally, the steak with rice and beans is a staple and it is excellent! So if a seasonal item doesn't catch your eye this should be your go to. I always plan to save room for dessert and I always love whatever I order. The dessert menu changes too but some of my favorites have been the banana cream pie and tres leches cake!

My friend wanted me to make reservations for her 30th birthday for 11 girls at 8PM. The first time I called Stephanie answered the phone and kindly stated that time was not available, told her I would check with the birthday girl and call her back. 2nd and 3rd time I called the phone was answered and slammed down. 4th time I called Stephanie answered the phone again. This time the reservation number went down to 9 girls at 9PM. Stephanie stated they couldn't not sit a party of 7+ at all. Thanked her and hung up. Long story short, we ended up getting a table for 9 girls at 9PM. Now to the dinner... All the girls arrived before our reservation at 9, we checked in and we were told it would be 5 minutes while the table was being set up. 5 minutes turned into 55 minutes and we were sat in the corner of an emtpy restaurant at 9:55PM.   We ordered drinks. The mojitos and the Burboun Whisperer we're really good! Appetizers we're also good, I had the Ropa Vieja. The presentation to this was wayyy different to how I had the dish in Puerto Rico but it was still good. For dinner I had the Arrachera and it was just a sad dish.

The paella and scallops were the two entrees chosen, and both dishes were exquisite. The paella rice was infused with the right amount of saffron, and the dish had a generous amount of shrimp, clams, mussels, and calamari. If you enjoy seafood, you will not be disappointed with this dish. The scallops were cooked perfectly, and were immaculately clean (not one bit of grit). The bacon and sweet potato puree were excellent accompaniments to the scallops. The dessert was not as memorable, it was an angel cake log with passion fruit, but it wasn't terrible.  Hence the four stars instead of five.

The colors, detailed decor and quirky sophistication just leap out at you. One cannot help but to bring out the camera and yes I even busted out my camera in the mammoth bathroom. Epic atmosphere aside, the high octane Christmas dinner we had was definitely worthy of the occasion. Like the millions before us, we opted to start with the Ropa Vieja brisket hard tacos. What a tasty appetizer that was. It is definitely a must have item.  Onto entrees, my wife had the market fish of the day, which was served over clams, cauliflower and rice soaked in a herb rich sea broth. I opted for the prime strip steak, which was decadently seasoned and served with a side of rich bone marrow and a cheesed up potato arrangement. How good were they?

For entrees, we split the shrimp and grits and the churrasca.  Both were really excellent, I was surprised by how flavorful the grits were, they had a nice mushroom taste to them.  The churrasca was beautifully medium rare.  If you're into sharing, they make a nice surf n turf combination for entrees.

I could've, and should've, stopped after the appetizers and the sangria (my second drink wasn't nearly as good as the sangria), and I would've been mind blowingly satisfied.   Service was friendly and helpful, but a bit absentee, especially once we neared the end of our meal.   I don't know what it is about basement bathrooms either, but some better ventilation down there would be good.",0.9967,0.689,0.278,0.032,0.5782921810699588

They were unable to point to any reason why they were too intoxicated, apart that we were ""bumping around"". We all had a couple drinks before dinner but were in no way disruptive.

Seated in a less-than-ideal table in a cold side room, and the server had no idea we were celebrating. When he asked if we had ever been here, told him we had our reception and had come back from DC for our anniversary just to celebrate. Got one ""congrats"" and that was about it.

The décor from the outside & inside is very fun and colorful, so we loved the whole theme Carnivale had to offer. The ambiance was very nice.  The Cotton Candy Martini was sooooooo yummy. I recommend it for anyone who likes sweet alcoholic beverages. T Our server was pretty good, although he did forget to bring two of us silverware & never really checked back on us to see if we needed anything... Which I find to be rather annoying when I DO need something.  I ordered the Lechon Asado, and let me tell you it is AMAZING. So delicious. Definitely pricey for the portions they give you, but still very good.  I ordered the Organic Cotton Candy and that was tasty.  They use actual cotton candy and pour the martini over it, which makes it so sweet.  The reason why I give this place only 3 stars is because toward the end of our dinner, a person who seemed to work for the band that plays there offered to take our picture. After he took a picture with our phone for us, he took out HIS OWN PHONE and took a picture of us and a picture angled down at my friend's chest... That was really unprofessional and made our night uncomfortable.

He even tried some words in Portuguese when I said I was from Brazil. I had a caipirinha and it was the real deal! Just like the ones we have back home. We skipped appetizer and went with his recommendation for the churrasco. Omg the best sirloin cut ever. And I know brazilian steak! The cut was just so tender it melted in my mouth. The fried yucca and the mashed yucca were just as fabulous. Bottom line is that we finished out dish in 10 minutes. It was really good. For dessert we had the banana cream pie, also suggestion of Rick and again, omg! Party in my mouth!!! I wish I could lick the plate but that would embarrass my boyfriend. So so good. Everything.

Interior design was very nice, colorful, and well put together for an awesome theme. We were about 10 minutes late and got seated right away, the place was fairly slow around 7:30. Our server came to the table fairly quick after being seated and since we knew what we wanted we ordered right away.  Our appetizers were the Ropa Vieja's, goat cheese, and wild mushroom coca. Apps were great, especially the mushroom coca the flavoring was perfect and it had a good amount of mushrooms, excellent choice! The Ropa Vieja's were also really good. Now I ordered their famous Churrasco steak for my meal and boy was that a bad decision. It was a good cut of steak, nice 10 oz. steak cooked just right but for some reason it tasted like seafood, very strong taste of seafood. I had my friends try it also an they tasted the same thing, it was just a really bad taste. At this point everything went downhill, the place started to get busy and our waiter disappeared for a while and when we did see him he was flying by, we would have to stop him or tap him to get his attention. I think they were understaffed for as busy as they got. I told out waiter that I just couldn't eat that steak, he was understanding and said that he has to call a manager over to talk to me, a manager shows up and I explain to him the taste of seafood and that my friends also tasted it also. I was a little irritated after speaking to the manager cause he seemed to think I was lying and had no idea what was going on in his kitchen, he offered to replace it with something else but didn't care one bit. He recommended the NY steak so I ordered that, cooked medium-medium rare. The good news is it tasted like steak and not the Pacific Ocean the bad news is it was was very charred on the outside and dry and just NOT good. I was over everything in that place so I didn't even bother saying anything else.  I don't see myself coming to this place again unless it's for drinks and some appetizers.

Not only did it taste good but it was so much fun to watch her make it (I should have made a video versus 8 still progressive photos). It starts with a big ball of cotton candy in a martini glass. Then the bartender pours the drink from the shaker onto the cotton candy. It dissolves as she pours.  The owner was hanging out at the bar and I was introduced to him. Very nice.

2014-09-17,3.0,"I really wanted to like Carnivale, but unfortunately there are some things holding it back which lead me to give the review a slightly lower rating. Lets dive in! Ambiance: The ambiance of Carnivale is its biggest selling points. Its truly interesting and unique. Definitely worth checking out just to have that unique experience.  Food: Carnivale at the end of the day is a restaurant, so the most important part of the review should probably be the food. Unfortunately every dish we ordered was ok at best. Like I said we all really wanted to like Carnivale, but the food was just lacking. It was bland, dry, and overall not very flavorful. The mini tacos were good, but the rest of the meal was not very good at all. Definitely some cool options on the menu, but nothing really turned out tasting very good.  Staff: The staff was awesome! Our waiter was happy, very knowledgeable of the menu, and she had a great conversation with the table.  Dessert:  Dessert was great! We ordered the cake, yes the one in all of the pictures on Yelp! It was a really good cake, and I highly recommend it.  Overall, this place is lined up to be a great restaurant, but the food isn't very good. The ambiance, vibe, staff, and even the dessert were all great its just that we all didn't really like our food.

2014-09-15,3.0,"Good food - mediocre service My GF and I recently went to celebrate at Carnivale. We were treated very nicely, but some things were a bit off. Everyone knows the good things about this place, but I'll say just a few things that irked me: - I had a very nice new car, and the Valet tried to get me to park it outside as some kind of ""VIP"" parking. I didn't care, but then he told me it would be safer for my car. That left a bad taste in my mouth, people shouldn't try to play you like that. - We called ahead and alerted the staff to a capsaicin (chili) allergy me GF has. They said yes yes, but when the food arrived it had not been modified one bit. There were literally jalapeno rings covering the ceviche they brought. Maybe just tell us if it isn't possible? Then we could have ordered something else? Anything so my GF's intestines aren't jump roping around her pancreas. - When my GF steak was cooked well done instead of rare (opposite ends of the spectrum) they said sorry and brought out a new one. It happens. A bit awkward watching my GF eat by herself because it came 15 minutes after I was done. - The manager offered to ""comp our appetizers"", but then when the waiter came with the check he had only comped one of them. - This was the biggest one: I had a brainfart and meant to leave 140 on a 118 tab. But accidentally left 120. The waiter tracked me down at the valet as I was about to get into my car to tell me gratuity wasn't included. Now... fair play, I totally forgot to include that last 20. But... I had technically paid my bill. What kind of ""fine dining"" establishments run after their clientelle to the valet for a tip? I thought that was in poor taste. Needless to say I was not impressed. The food is great, the decoration is lovely. A tad overpriced, but not more than 20%. I guess the decor makes up for it. They even covered up the paris hilton portrait in the bathroom with a potted plant in the bathroom (most of the reason this is 3 stars not 2 stars), but there was just a lot of little things that irked me about this place.",0.9456,0.821,0.105,0.074,0.6023232323232324

When you're paying $$$, it's refreshing to have outstanding service. We ordered the Cotton Candy Martini which came with a big dollop of Pink Cotton Candy (homemade right in the restaurant). Everyone in our group our table took a pinch before Freddy poured the martini into the glass and  the cotton candy slowly melted into a sweet dream! One of our favorites is the ROPA. Melt in your mouth meat tacos. We all enjoyed our entrees which were generous in portions, 3 of us had to get to go containers.

Filled with bright colored lamps, lights and a wide open space for seating it's a unique experience just to gaze upon the rocking decor. Our waitress was also top notch.

I made a reservation thru Yelp's Open Table actually, and added bouquet of flowers our table. When we got there, everything was already set up. Bonus points for me that night! Heat check: atmosphere was nice; service was awesome. And now for food... We started with some ceviche. It was really fresh and was enough for 2. I was told to get the ropa vieja but I forgot to order that. (Don't worry, I ordered it the second and third time I was back). But they were BOMB. They were braised beef stuffed in plantain taco shells. I suggest each and everyone of you yelpers to try it. And for the entree, I got the tomahawk steak. It was the size of my face! I got it cooked the way I like - medium rare. For dessert, we shared the 3-layered ice cream cake. It was composed of pistachio, guava, and vanilla bean. My girlfriend loved the pistachio, and my favorite was the guava.   And we lived happily ever after. The end.",0.9806,0.807,0.167,0.026,0.5522222222222223

Still tasted them all, but I wasn't blown away- like I usually am with ceviche samplers (swoon). I ordered the quesadilla because a friend told me it was the best item on the menu but it was something a college student could make... The saddest part was that it came with no sauce.. WHAT. Alert : Sauce ambassadors  all over  the world- the quesadillas come with no sauce! Thank goodness we ordered a large guac to share, and I also ordered a side is chipotle salsa. Now were talking!  Food was meh but we had fun guessing if people would surprise us by swinging from the colorful curtains all over the restaurant. They also had an interesting birthday dessert- stale caramel corn and cotton candy. The caramel corn was like wax / plastic but the cotton  candy was hilarious to eat.  I will note that the waitress dropped one of our credit cards on the floor and the table next to us brought it to our attention. When we asked her about it, she said she had suspected that she did that, but she still charged the remaining cards the wrong amounts.... She quickly took them back and amended the charges.

Entrees- Arrachera - grilled skirt steak with rice, beans, and red onions. This is my favorite entree here and it is pretty filling as well. Salmon - very flavorful and was cooked perfectly. Churrasco - prime sirloin that melts in your mouth. This was a close one, but I have to give it to the Arrachera as my favorite entree here still.  Desserts- Carnivale Ice Cream Cake - 3 layered cake (vanilla bean, guava and pistachio, and lemon curds. Pretty good, but I am a sucker for sweets. Tres Leches - pretty good.

The Mojitos are watered down compared to before.  However, the service was very sub-par. It was a long wait to get the menus after seated, and the waiter did not introduce us to any specials for the day, or mention what is the ""market fish"" for the day.  The particular waiter we had today only checked on us very infrequently, and each time just asked us if we wanted more cocktails without offering re-filling the iced teas or asking how the food was. We had to flag him down to get iced tea re-filled. Very unprofessional. When we told him we were fully stuffed and did not want any dessert, he seemed reluctant and asked ""are you sure""? It's not like we did not order much: we spent close to $200 between the three of us and we even had left-over entree to take home. When we told him that we didn't want any dessert, he should simply reply 'no problem' and nothing more. When the bill came, there is a ""suggested tip"" of 20%, which is usually what I pay. I gave my credit card to him, and he asked me if he could just put the tips directly on the card, for a party of three! It was hard to say ""no"" at that moment. Even though I did plan to give him 20% tips anyway at that moment,  in retrospect his sub-par service did not deserve it, and I should just say no and give him a 15% tip. The practice of offering to  charge 20% tips automatically to a party of 3 is unacceptable.  They also increased their valet parking rates to $7, which is not worth it for this neighborhood. A rate of $7 is kind of forcing you to pay $10 including tips, which is a lot for that neighborhood. I will not go back to this restaurant again",-0.7799,0.884,0.041,0.075,0.43002070393374725

I went for the charrasco which was a bit over seasoned, a little too salty, but cooked perfectly. The yuca puree and yuca sticks were a great addition to the plate. The bf went with the arranchera and really enjoyed it. It was cooked to his liking and had great flavors. Our side order of asparagus was nothing to rave about. We're not a big dessert couple, but they had an apple pie a la mode, unfortunately for us, Canivale didn't have any at the time, bummer. Overall, a good experience. I would rate it more of a 3.5.",0.9914,0.675,0.236,0.089,0.588676923076923

The restaurant was colorful, and enormous with high ceilings. We started off with a few pitchers of sangria. It being my birthday, of course, I ordered a Tequilla flight to get the celebration started --  I'm no tequilla expert, each of the three tequilla shots tasted different and were surprisingly smooth. For appetizers, we shared guacamole, ropa vieja, and the calamari -- I thought the ropa vieja was the best of the three. For the main course, I decided to share small dishes with friends. We ordered the quesadillas de camarones, oxtail empanadas, and the truffle cheese arepas. I loved the empanadas and arepas -- highly recommend both.  After the meal, the waiters come out with a cute cotton candy display and caramel popcorn as a birthday treat- made for good pictures and they were delicious!",0.9936,0.725,0.264,0.011,0.5669607843137255

Our waitress was very knowledgeable and recommended we try the ropa vieja appetizer. I am not a big red meat eater, but I could have eaten this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Succulent and delicious - juicy meat, savory flavoring and in a crispy little taco shell. I ordered the salmon with mustard sauce and quinoa for my entree and it was also excellent. My friends ordered the rack of lamb and the fish special and we were all impressed. The only small disappointment was dessert - the waitress recommended the lava mousse cake, and it was good - just not what we expected.

2014-07-10,4.0,"What a spot! With many upstairs', downstairs', backrooms, and little curtain-shielded nooks, this enormous restaurant somehow feels cozy. The outside sets the mood with a huge mural that exclaims ""LIVE A COLORFUL LIFE"". This motto is clearly the inspiration for the inside decor; from the moment you walk in, Carnivale transports you to a different world.  Enter Carnivale: You walk into the bar, a small area with large red velvet seats that reminded me of the Great Gatsby. Full disclosure: I don't know if the seats are actually red velvet, but that's the image that I walked away with in my mind.  You stand in the bar with a buzzer, waiting to be called by the hostess. There's a curtain separating the bar from the main dining area, and behind you can see glimpses of a whole different world. The ceiling feels like it's miles high, the walls are red, swings dangle from above, and suddenly you feel like you've entered the set of Chicago. Side rooms abound, allowing diners to escape the grandness of the main dining room to a quieter, more intimate setting. But even in the side rooms, the dim lighting and photos on the wall captivate the essence of Carnivale with pictures of bare-chested women, and more.  But what is the food like amidst this unique atmosphere? Delicious. Latin American fusion is done fantastically by the cooks at Carnivale. I tried the tuna ceviche, tacos de pescado, the heirloom and beet salad, and the side of caramelized sweet plantains. Everything was fantastic. My friend LOVED the ceviche, I LOVED the fish tacos. We all loved the heirloom and beet salad, but it only came with about 4 slices of beets on the plate, which was quite disappointing. And there's no going wrong with sweet plantains! Great meal, great atmosphere, great place. Live a colorful life and dine here!",0.9971,0.753,0.215,0.032,0.55583850931677
2014-07-09,3.0,"I came here with a bunch of people for a friend's birthday, which was a lot of fun! The restaurant is massive with high ceilings and colorful décor that you would expect at a place called Carnivale. We all started off the night with a couple of pitchers of sangria, which were not too sweet and very refreshing. The birthday girl also wanted to take a shot (tequila naturally since we were at a Latin fusion place) and I was the only sucker that agreed to take it with her even though I don't really like tequila. However to my dismay, she decides to get a flight of tequila for us to share! I was initially a little nervous because I wasn't prepared to have one of those nights, but they actually turned out to be really good! All three were different, but similar in that they were very smooth and light. Definitely not Jose Cuervo or anything I normally drink.  As far as food, we all shared the guacamole and ropa vieja as an appetizer. The guacamole was tasty, but nothing special and the ropa vieja was very tender, but I thought that it was drenched in too much sauce and each taco was too small to be satisfying. Of the group, 5 of us decided to share more appetizers and do the meal tapas style, so we also ordered the calamari, quesadillas de camarones, oxtail empanada, and the truffle cheese arepa. As a whole, I thought the food was very mediocre. The calamari was crispy, but the sweet & sour adobo sauce was drizzled over it (sparsely and unevenly I might add) rather than coming on the side, which I would've preferred. I guess Carnivale doesn't like to do dipping sauces because the quesadillas did not come with anything either. They were my least favorite part of my meal because without any salsa or guac, they were incredibly dry. I'm also not a fan of goat cheese, so when one friend wanted to order the truffle cheese arepa, I knew it wouldn't be my favorite part of the meal. As expected, I didn't care for the arepa, but the eggplant catalan and cilantro pipian sauce that it came with was my tastiest bite of the night! For dessert, they brought out cotton candy and caramel corn for birthday girl, which was a light and fun way to end the night. Overall, I'd rate Carnivale 3 stars because of drinks and atmosphere, even though I felt like the food deserved 2 stars.",0.572,0.844,0.074,0.082,0.5515750915750914

Appetizers: -Ceviche tasting: 4 different ceviches, decent but I would pass on this.  Nothing spectacular or out of this world. -Guacamole: good but I would also pass on this.   -Ropa Vieja: THE BOMB. MUST ORDER. Tender, braised beef with this amazing aioli and queso that is so addicting. The texture of the beef and the taco shell just complement each other -Oxtail Empanada: delish!  Cant really go wrong with empandas and oxtail.  Put the two together and it's a party in your mouth.  -Quesadillas: Decent but pass.  Cheese and a tortilla..meh  Entrees -Arrachera : tasty but not my favorite entrée.  You can never go wrong with grilled skirt steak and rice but it isn't the best option here -Seafood Paella: yummy but also not my first choice.  Portions are large, rice is well flavored and plenty of seafood -New York Strip: OMG. SO GOOD!  This is one of the best entrees in my opinion.  Tender, juicy steak rubbed with adobo with a side of cheesy potatoes AND bone marrow topped with veal marmalade. DROOOOOL.  You must order your steak medium rare or rare to really appreciate it.  As for the bone marrow..wow, it just melts in your mouth and the veal on top is just a bonus! -Lechon Asado (currently not on the menu): YUM. Succulent, braised pork shoulder over yucca puree and cabbage.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND if it comes back on the menu.  The cabbage gives a nice slightly sour punch to the dish -Smoked Bone-In Short Rib: I only tried a bite but it was very tender and tasty Desserts  -Banana Cream Pie: From what I remember I liked it..but I only had a spoonful..ok maybe 2 haha  Best part is that it comes in a mason jar!  hehe -Cotton Candy: not a big fan of cotton candy but they do make it there so it's fresh! Drinks -Margarita: pass (but I may be biased since i'm not a big fan of margaritas) -Mango something martini: yummy but VERY strong.  I couldn't even finish it.  I know..weaksauce.  If this list of food and drinks hasn't convinced you to try Carnivale, then you are a fool!

For the main dinner, we each had the lamb which was beyond perfection...the meat was cooked exactly as we wanted and it was worth the money.  Since it was for a birthday, we also opted for dessert and we couldn't agree on one so we got two - the chocolate cake and ice cream cake - also both delicious!  I mentioned to our waiter that is was for my boyfriend's birthday and he had a candle brought out with the ice cream cake which was so nice...also quiet and low-key...not a fan of places that make birthdays a big deal, but this was a nice touch.

2014-06-23,3.0,"Just a quick review. Went there with a large group last Friday Night for a friends 40th BDay, 9:00 reservation. I have been here in the past, Prices are high, but the high quality of food and service are usually worth the premium. Got there at 8:50 didn't get a table until 9:30. We were told they were just busy.. Went to the bar, ordered 2 bottled beers off the menu at $7:50 a piece, and was told it was $16.50.  I was told the prices went up (rudely) when I asked about the difference. I didn't leave a tip. Was seated a large table place is fun colorful and loud as expected. Waiter was polite and had a smile, but he was REALLY pushing the upsell, suggesting extra appetizers because he thought we needed more, (""you really need three guacamoles for this many people"") and then at least half of us were told the items we wanted to order for our meal  (gnocchi and skirt steak. I.E.) were not really the good items on the menu and we should order this or that instead, pointing out all the pricier items.  I didn't think much about it until we go the bill an hour later (with the TIP already Included).   I am disappointed, We ended up paying over $70.00 per person and we only had 1 or 2 drinks each.  The food was good, but not great.  And I regret to say that because of this greedy attitude I will not be going back anytime soon.  So much for the bar being set higher. Sorry Carnivale, you have dropped the ball, your staff that we encountered was out to make a bunch of cash, not caring about us or our experience. Update:  I have emailed their restaurant twice about my experience hoping to speak to someone about this less than satisfactory experience, I got one response from someone saying they would forward it to the appropriate person, whom I thanked then nothing, followed up with the person i did manage to contact a couple weeks later.  Only to still get no response a second time.   This only makes me never want to go here again..

But, after a few vodka martinis, the bartender refused to serve me anymore liquor because he said something along the lines of ""it's not in your best interest to drink anymore"". Hmm. I'm pretty sure that's not one of his roles or responsibilities as a bartender.  I talked with the manager who said there was a policy about how much liquor they can serve an individual and that I could switch to beer. I was far from sober at this point, but I was also far from being inappropriately intoxicated. So, I'm not really sure why this was necessary...  If this liquor maximum policy is an actual policy of Carnivale, this is extremely customer-unfriendly. Or, if customer service staff are attempting to exercise their personal discretion to make moral judgments about their customers behaviors, well, this is also extremely customer-unfriendly.

2014-06-10,3.0,"Here's the bottom line:  You should go.  You should go and see what Carnivale is all about.  I believe you'll have a good time. I believe you'll enjoy the food. I don't believe Carnivale will live up to the hype you've heard and I'm guessing you'll feel you overspent a bit, but ultimately I think you'll be glad you went. Decor: Pretty awesome really. Fun. Colorful. Unlike any other place I've been. On the other hand, we were not seated in the main dining room. We did not get to enjoy the brightly colored room you see in all the photos. Still, we were seated at a beautiful marble table surrounded by luxurious velvet chairs and adjacent to an ornate mirror. It was beautiful and comfortable, but it was not the main dining room experience. Many of us got up from our table to take a peak at the main dining room; like children exiled upstairs quietly peering from behind the banister at the adults having a party downstairs. Food: The food was delicious. I started with the Yellowfin tuna ceviche with cucumber, apples, tarragon, basil, & orange chili sauce. It was delectable and a surprisingly good portion for $12. Plenty of tuna. Enough to share (though I kept most of it for myself!) I tasted a friend's cod tacos and thought the fish was excellent.  I ordered the Lechon Asado -- a braised pork shoulder with yuca purée, red cabbage, basil mojo, and chicharron -- for my entree. The pork was fork-tender and flavorful and everything went well together except the chicharron. That was the palest, saddest chicharron I've ever tasted. More like a rice cake than a chicharron. I tried my friend's grilled skirt steak with chimichurri (Arrachera) and did a little happy food dance.  One of my friends ordered the chocolate lava mousse cake and it was deep, dark, and decadent. Highly recommended for the chocaholics in the crowd. The table also shared several pieces of the Carnivale ice cream cake which is vanilla bean, guava & pistachio ice cream layered between pieces of chocolate cake. It's a beauty to look at. Colorful like the main dining room. It's lighter on the palate than it looks like it would be, but also less flavorful. More a feast for the eyes than the palate. Service: Service was slow and sometimes forgetful. We waited and waited to place our orders for drinks, then for appetizers, then for entrees, then for dessert. Our very first request -- for guacamole while we decided about everything else -- was completely forgotten. In our waitress's defense, however, I did not see any other waitstaff in our area. If she was it, Carnivale was severely short-staffed that night and it was a problem. She was polite, but I only recall here smiling once. Not the good-time, party atmosphere Carnivale markets. Bonus: Valet parking is only $7. If you've ever had to park in the the City you know this is a bargain! Plus there was hardly any wait coming or going.

They have an amazing system for private parties that include a timed schedule of when the appetizers and drinks would go out, the entrees and desserts, etc. We were even able to choose our own linens and how we wanted the tables to be set up. (If we wanted four separate tables, or one grand dining table.) Being that we had to fulfill the minimums, we talked through everything and she actually informed me when she thought I was ordering too much, which was so thoughtful.  Being that we only gave them three days notice, the only private room they had available was a room that was right behind the bar before you actually entered the dining room, which was better than we could have imagined. They told us that they had never used this space for a private event before, but it was absolutely perfect. We had our own private entrance, and it was easy for guests to find without having to enter the crowded dining room.  On to the birthday extravaganza: Guests were arriving, greeted by our own private wait staff, with our cold appetizers waiting and drinks ready to go. From that point on, everything went super smoothly. There was always a member of the staff ready and waiting for any requests. After our allotted drinks and mingling time, we were asked to be seated at the table and our hot appetizers arrived within seconds. Our orders were taken, and within ten minutes our food was in front of us. Apparently, when they have a private event, they use a completely separate kitchen than the regular dining room has, in order to make service very quick. We actually had a guest arrive about 30 minutes into dinner, and the server got his order while entering, and by the time he had greeted everybody and sat down, his meal was on the table. Drinks:  The margaritas were pretty standard, nothing to write home about.  The Sangria was aesthetically pleasing and though I did not try it, my guests said it was tasty.  In addition, the mojitos were very, very good! (even the coconut edition)  Food: We had ordered the chips and guac and the large charcuterie plate to be ready for us on the tables as guests arrived, and it was amazing.  The chips and guac were great, perfectly limey. The large charcuterie plate was perfect for the sixteen people who were there, with the cheeses and smoked meats. The olives were to die for. As for dinner, fourteen of the sixteen ordered the Ropa Vieja, and honestly I have never seen so many plates cleaned in my entire life. It was absolutely delicious. My mom and I each had the short ribs, which, with the exception of the risotto, was perfection. (Nothing against their recipe, I just do not think we have ever liked it.)",0.9992,0.791,0.199,0.01,0.5938000375692682
2014-05-28,4.0,"I think my jaw dropped when I entered this place.  It's wildly colorful inside (which could have gone horribly wrong, but hasn't here), MASSIVE in size, is priced well, and the service was fantastic.  It's perfect for both regular meals and special events and especially large groups.  All ages can appreciate this place.  I'd give it the full 5 stars, but we didn't like one of our entrees and there aren't really any fun places (...or anything...) nearby. I came for a Sunday brunch and was impressed.  They had a four-piece string quartet playing a classical take on pop songs in the middle of the main dining area.  If, for some crazy reason, you don't want to take this all in, there's plenty of quiet seating and four-top tables outside along the front of the restaurant (pics below).  There's also a smaller dining room (quiet, non-festive decor) and seating around the bar.  Maybe it's because this place is so huge, but there seemed to be very few people here for a weekend brunch.  You're missing out! During brunch, I kept on looking around, expecting to see a photo booth.  Well, whaddya know, there was one downstairs right next to an ATM and a bathroom (clean, large, long row of stalls, btw).  I think that cements Carnivale as being a venue in addition to a restaurant.   Finally, onto the food:  -Huevos Rancheros: Delicious and served fresh in a skillet.  I liked the red-sauced rice.  The black beans, which we requested be served on the side, were more like black bean soup. -Red Velvet French Toast: Blech.  The toast  was a boring mini-loaf of bread.  But the bruleed marshmallow and sour cream ice cream were good.",0.985,0.775,0.154,0.071,0.5028401679621193

Not the greatest, but seeing as it was decent enough to finish as opposed to all the people that hardly touched their cotton candy made it seem like we made a good Choice. I'm really sad to say we had the worst waiter of all which kind of made the dining experience one of the worst I've had. We had a gift certificate for $100 and our bill was $80. He took the certificate, left for what seemed like 10 minutes and came back saying we were all set. Where was the remainder of our gift certificate? The staffing seemed so sparse that we left and considered the $20 his tip which he clearly did not deserve. I hope some of that money went to the other wait staff which seemed to be with the program.

Our waiter was super friendly and helpful with food recommendations. We had the Ropa Vieja for our appetizer. One of the best small bites I've ever had. I got the Churro style waffle as it was called on the menu. When my plate was brought out there were 2 huge waffles on my plate. It was delicious but had to bring one home. My husband had the Chicken and waffles. He was very impressed by the chicken. He said the flavor was great and they had cooked the chicken perfectly. He also loved the carrot ginger juice.

Cons: The Arrachera (skirt steak) on the other hand did not cut it for me. It  was dry, underwhelming with flavor and the chimichurri could not, for its life, save this dish.

Ordered Calamari (possibly the best part of our dinner) Guacamole, and Ceviche Samplers. Our dinner took a minimum of 50 minutes to arrive and our drinks were empty for the majority of the meal. After complaints from all parties at the table, I decided to bring it to management's attention walking away to discuss the situation. The disinterest carried through to the manager who offered to make our experience better next time.

Interior= 3 Pretty damn rad.  You first enter into a small dimly lit loungy bar area. On the right is where the massive main dining area is. In the main dining area, the decor is very colorful and hella large in scale.  They also have a loft seating area as well as a VIP room.  Seating was comfortable and there was plenty of it.   Food= +1 We ordered     1. Ropa Vieja: 3/5         Steak was tender and juicy but the taste wasn't that memorable.      2. Australian Lamb Rack: 2/5         The first time I had this, it was nearly perfect! So mouth wateringly  juicy, tender, and flavorful.  But...this time, nothing like the first time.  Such a disappointment. I asked for medium well but I guess to them medium well is rare.  The lamb was hardly cooked and wouldn't stop bleeding.  So gross.  I took one bite and had to spit it out.  It was just plain raw. No flavor either.  My date ate the rest.  Who knows how many parasites he may have gotten from eating this raw meat. This was served with a side of spinach pastel which was pretty good.     3. Senator's Chicken: 3/5        This was I ended up eating instead.  I guess chicken is a much safer choice then red meat in any restaurant. This was actually juicy but not a strong flavor of...anything. 4. Carnivale Ice Cream Cake: 4/5      This and the cotton candy seemed to be the most popular desserts there. This dessert was huge!  Each section had it's own light flavor and all were pretty good.  The ice cream was wrapped in a chocolate...graham cracker? which was tasty touch.  Customer Service= 4/5 The servers we had both times were very polite and fairly attentive.  Cons=  -1 Drink  selection is incredibly limited.  I have a terrible sweet tooth and they only had one drink that was sweet which was a mango and pineapple cocktail. That was blah.  Parking: Plenty of street parking.  No need to valet.  Overall, I'd may be only go back for the desert.

My sister and I went there to celebrate am occasion..FRIDAY!!  I love the fact they have a a choice of tequila flights lucky I wasn't driving.  Instead I had the caprihaina. Mmm, so yummy!  My friend, Nancy make a perfect one and hers is the standard.  Perfection.  Then onto appetizer, ropa viejo and fish tacos. Having gone to Puerto Rico and had real ropa viejo, each time I order it here it reminds me of my time there.  So Good!!  This time served in a taco. Best first bite every.  I hardly eat red meat but tonite I was meatasaurus rex! I ordered the Arrachera and added a side of brussel sprouts.  Love brussel sprouts but they were shredded which was unexpected but still a winner.  The arrechera is perfectly cooked flank steak over rice and beans. My only regret when my dish arrived was i started at the wrong end.  I went for the smaller end which was more on the well side but the other end was a perfectly think, slightly pink juicy, smokey and flavorful bite.  Always start on the right side people, Lesson learned.  Jorge, our waiter, was so nice wonderfully attentive and when I asked for a recommendation for desert. He picked the white chocolate/chocolate mousse lava cake.  Not the best name since it is served cold but WOW!  Packing a super subtle but powerful chocolate punch.   One bite and I was over the edge.  DONE. end note. send the check.  Wrap that puppy up to go.   A great meal which ended with me at home in my pajamas eating the rest of my dessert catching up on Game of Thrones (sigh!)

2014-03-23,5.0,"I can't believe I haven't written a review for Carnivale yet. I love this place. And love it even more now that they have Chef Cuadros on board. Whatever he did to update the recipes/menu....it's been an amazing.  For dinner I always start off with the ropa vieja. The meat is placed inside a plantain shell like a mini taco. I've tried the calamari, quesadillas and ceviche tasting. I like the sweet & sour sauce on the calamari is perfect wth the crispy breading. The quesadillas and ceviche were average. My fave entree is the lechon asado. The pork just pulls apart so easily and is seasoned perfectly. The yuca puree has a nice sticky texture...similar to a thicker mashed potato.The arrachera is my second favorite dish. The short rib is also good. The only side I've tried is the truffle mashed potato gratin which was delicious. Now for desserts...I've tried the cotton candy, tres leches cake, and banana cream pie. The tres leches and banana cream pie were both really good. Just a heads up, the banana cream pie isn't actually a pie. It is more of a decomposed banana cream pie but a cool interpretation of the dessert. Recently, Carnivale started offering brunch on Sundays. I'm so glad they did. I had the bacon bloody mary and my friend had the pisco punch. The bloody was nothing special (but it was pretty strong). The punch was good though. We started off with the meatball which was one giant ball with a side of bread. It was well seasoned and the ricotta went well with it. We shared the key lime french toast and tripleta burrito. The french toast was hands down the BEST FRENCH TOAST ever. Filled with a key lime pudding, perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. You don't need any syrup because the brown butter sauce and pineapple syrup are plenty sweet. The burrito was good too...had plenty of meat inside and a crispy wrap.  I think every time I've gone there's been a live band/string quartet playing instrumental versions of pop songs from the 60's-now. I love it!

2014-03-19,4.0,"Carnivale is a vibrant and colorful place, not to mention huge!!! They were having a livingsocial here, and my girflriend and I heard great things so we decided to give it a try. I was really surprised by how massive this place is- there's a large lounge/bar area, tons of tables on the first floor, not to mention even more on the second for both couples and large parties.  We were seated upstairs and our server was very helpful and attentive. We started out with the ropa vieja which consisted of five small, tender beef tacos. Filled with flavor, they were an enjoyable app to start our meal off. Next I ordered the arrachera which was a little gummy even though I ordered it medium-rare. The flavor hit the spot though, and the rice + beans were well seasoned. My girlfriend's short rib was sooooo good. I couldn't stop eating it and was happy to swap plates halfway through the meal. It was a huge hunk of tender meat. The kimchee apples were very, very weird, and I hope that Carnivale does away with them because they did not belong with the dish. For dessert we share the chocolate mousse cake. It was damn difficult trying to figure out just one dessert to try- we should have ordered two, but I don't think our stomachs would have been too pleased. The mousse cake came with both white and dark chocolate, encased in a chocolate shell, and drizzled with fudge. It was delicious and left me feeling quite satisfied. For what you get here, the food is definitely overpriced; however the fun vibes, large party tables, and great service are definitely worth coming for.",0.9945,0.775,0.199,0.026,0.5556216931216932
2014-03-16,4.0,"Hispanic mother-approved. Whenever my mom comes to visit from Miami, I like to take her out somewhere nice. She's a little stuck in her ways, like most Cuban moms. For this reason, I tend to stick with Latin cuisine so she doesn't complain. Hubby and I brought her to Carnivale and crossed out fingers that she'd be happy.  We grabbed a drink at the bar while we waited for our table to get set up. We all ordered sangrias and mom was already smiling. Night was off to a good start! We were quickly escorted to our table and mom gasps at how beautifully decorated the main dining room is. Since it was late December, there was a huge Christmas tree with a dancer figurine piercing through it. The eclectic mix of hot pinks, yellows and blue stained glass and funky artwork definitely upheld the Carnivale name. Our server immediately introduced themselves, told us the specials and offered us refills on our drinks. Yes, please! I practically interrupted her mid-sentence. I also let her know that we had purchased a Living Social deal. She was cool with it and continued getting our drinks. We later ordered ceviche mixto to start, hubby had arrachera, mom, the lechon asado and I, the truffle cheese arepa (truffle 'til I die!). I took 2 bites of my dish and realized it was pretty bland, mushy, with 0 truffle. It was truly sub-par but I made it a point to let the server know when she asked. She apologized profusely, offered me something else and took it off the bill. Everyone else loved their food, even mom! She said that her rendition of the lechon is better (obs) but this was a close second. She wanted dessert so we ordered the ice cream cake. I was so full and tipsy after this point, I didn't need any more food.  I was really happy with my experience at Carnivale. The drinks, app, and service were excellent. I realize I originally had a couple fish options for dinner, but ended up with a mediocre vegetarian option. It could be that I just picked the 1 blah dish on the whole menu. I do understand it's tough to have a restaurant with a complete award-winning menu and some dishes will be stronger than others. The fact that the server didn't treat me like a second-class citizen for having a Living Social deal and was persistently attentive, made the experience completely worth it. I will definitely go back and try a fish dish next time but I would suggest Carnivale try to hook vegetarians up with something other than pasta and mushy arepa.

2014-03-14,4.0,"Based on my last dinner experience and other Yelp reviews, I decided to avoid the wait by making reservations for lunch instead on a Tuesday. We found street parking last time, but not this time. Carnivale had a sign in front that said complimentary parking in the PARK1 lot diagonally across the street. There was no valet guy in front of the restaurant and the sign didn't say complimentary valet parking, so we just parked in the PARK1 lot. Once we parked, a PARK1 attendant said we had to get a ticket from the restaurant's valet guy to display in our car. So we went across the street and finally found the valet guy at the side of the building inside someone else's car. When we asked for a ticket, he actually made us go back to the car and drive it to the front of the restaurant so that he can drive it back to the same lot. I wish the sign was more clear or the valet guy was in sight when we first pulled up to the restaurant to read the sign. When the parking ordeal was over, we were inside the restaurant and seated pretty quickly in the lounge area. It wasn't too busy because there were only a couple of tables occupied. I guess lunch takes place in the lounge, but dinner takes place in the main high-ceiling dining area. We ordered the Ropa Vieja, two Steak and Mash entrees and the Carnivale Ice Cream Cake. The Ropa Vieja was okay. The flavor reminded me of almost like a bowl of chili. I really wish I got to try this appetizer before the restaurant changed it to mini taco shells since other Yelpers mentioned that it was better before. The skirt steak was incredibly tender, juicy and flavorful. I'm glad to see they reverted the ice cream cake somewhat back to its original form of a slice of cake instead of the three individual cake pieces. My favorite flavor was the guava and pistachio (which was sooo good). It was funny to see our dessert menus had different prices; one listed $7 and the other listed $9 (the website menu listed $7 also). Our server told us that the correct price is $9 (booooo!). Speaking of website menus, you can't rely on them. It's not up-to-date with the restaurant's current dishes and prices. The current prices are higher. Our server was quick at first to take our orders and bring our food, but something happened along the way because the service started to slow down towards the middle even though there weren't more tables to tend. My first time dining here took three hours for dinner. Seeing as how this was a non-busy Tuesday afternoon, I thought that we would be out the door quickly, but nope! Time moves at a turtle's speed here, so if you're on a time crunch, drive right past this restaurant and dine somewhere else. Otherwise, enjoy your long lunch or dinner.

As for parking, they have $7 valet, street parking, and street parking with a meter (2 hour limit) I think I saw a few pay lots in the area as well.  Considering it was early evening on a Sunday I just parked on the street and paid the meter.  Oh, city of Chicago...I have a love/hate relationship for you. Anyway.... Upon entering I was asked if I wanted complimentary coat check - I passed and was fine throwing my winter coat on the back of my seat.  I waited in the lobby for my friend to meet me and went in.  The front desk staff were very friendly asking if we preferred a table in the bar area by the window or in the dining room.  I think the dining room looked very nice, but we opted for the window seat. Drinks, as in cocktails, martinis, sangria, etc. are in the $10 range which is typical for downtown Chicago.  We ordered the large guacamole as an appetizer.  The bowl is huge, the serving size of the chips is small, but free refills so it's all good.  My friend wanted a mango margarita - she got one on the rocks, when ordering drink #2 she asked if she could have it blended.  We were told for some reason they do not make any blended drinks on Sunday...weird, huh?! Yeah, we thought so too.  I went simple...I ordered sangria. We both ordered the skirt steak for dinner which came with black beans & rice (both requested no onions) and it was Soooooo good.  So good in fact I finished the entire thing.  Oink! Yes, even with the $40 off living social deal, our bill was over $100 but...it was so worth it.  We had the large guacamole appetizer, two meals, and two drinks each.  I don't treat myself out to good eats too often, or at least good eats in this price range in the city too often so I was ok treating myself.   If you have been wanting to go to this place, GO!  It's SO worth it!!!",0.995,0.832,0.151,0.017,0.4749574829931973

Highly recommend. The entrees were good, not spectacular. Wife had the short ribs. The meat was tender and juicy, but the accoutrement was bland.

We made a reservation for 8 pm, got there at 8 pm and were sat at 8:25 pm. We chilled at the bar, ordered some drinks and talked to the bartenders who kept us pretty entertained.  Let me just say, the restaurant is gorgeous, so vibrant. Whoever designed it needs to come to my apartment and get to work. So we head back into the restaurant, all the way back, to the corner. Which I didn't mind as much except I didn't see any of this going on  youtube.com/watch?v=IHd0…  and well, that kind of ruined it for me. hahaha We got five appetizers between for seven of us to share. Oh the deliciosity! (Yea, that's a word, according to urban dictionary...http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=deliciosity)  Appetizers *Calamari, Ropa Vieja, Tuna ceviche and a cheese tasting. LOVED the Ropa Vieja, too bad they didn't offer that as a meal. Dinner (Descriptions straight from the menu) *Short Rib -Boniato puree, apple & jicama kimchee, Mick Klug Farm cider glaze *Fideos - Housemade pasta, wild mushroom ragout, Parmigiano Reggiano  *Arrachera -  Grilled skirt steak, rice & beans, bacon sofrito, sweet red onion, chimichurri sauce  *Churrasco - Wood grilled beef tenderloin, braised greens, butternut squash puree, pumpkin seed chimichurri *Pork Chop - Maple Creek Farm smoked pork chop, crispy fufu, watercress, apples, cider glaze *Truffle Cheese Arepa - Eggplant catalan, pine nuts, goat cheese, cilantro pipian  Of course I tried all of them because my friends share! That's how awesome they are. I'm not sure what the seventh entree was, but I'm sure like the rest it was splendid, then again, if it was that good I'd remember it. Hmm. My favorite and the one I ordered, was the Arrachera. I ordered it medium rare and it was cooked through perfectly. I asked for their ""hot sauce"" and topped my rice & beans with it.....so good. The short rib melted in your mouth, I'd get that one too.  Dessert *Carnivale Ice Cream Cake - Vanilla bean, guava & pistachio ice creams, lemon curd *Banana cream pie - Oreo crumble, caramelized bananas, whipped cream The staff also brought a special treat for the birthday girl.

2014-02-23,2.0,"We are Carnivale regulars.  My husband and I have spent almost every anniversary here for the last 5 years.  Just 2 years ago, he proposed to me there.  Normally when we go,  we get seated within 10 minutes of our reservation, last night it took over 25 minutes.  The hostess was not accomodating at all either.  We were finally sat next to a table of 8 people, who were extremely loud and disturbing.  They really disrupted the romantic mood.  They should have never sat a couple on their anniversary table next to such a party-like, loud table.  Also, normally we get a complimentary glass of champaign for our anniversary, & that also did not happen.  The biggest disappointment was the food.  I feel horrible saying this,  but Carnivale keeps changing the best selling items on the menu.  The Ropa Veija, for example, is no longer served on a delicious plantain, it's now served in a taco. It's ok, but definitely a step down from the plantain.  The Churrasco, the best item on the menu, has definitely gotten worse.  It used to have a potato-goat cheese puree, & a roasted beet salsa.  They've changed it at least 5 times in the last few years, & each time it tastes more and more gross.  Last night, the churrasco appeared with a butternut squash puree,  pumpkin chips, & something green?  The steak was overcooked,  & tasted like it was paired with baby food.  The steak was completely overwhelmed by the taste of cinnamon/nutmeg.  We were disappointed by the food, especially for the price that we paid.   Carnivale needs to step up to bring their food and service  back up to the standard that their loyal diners expect.",0.9581,0.794,0.132,0.074,0.4343304843304844

What I mean by off is that it wasn't as great as it could have been. Some of the flavors were not blend in well together. And I feel like they should have stayed more of a Spanish menu. When I think of carnivals I think of Brazil. The main corse was great. I had he New York and my girlfriend had the Lamb chops. Both amazingly cooked and both great tasting.

2014-02-16,4.0,"Food was good, drink was good, atmosphere was good. Nothing blew my socks off, but it was definitely good and worth it. We made a reservation in advance for Valentine's Day. They had a prix fixe menu in addition to their normal menu, which was kind of nice to have the choice to order off of either menu. To drink I had a Carnivale Martini (pomegranate, mango, tequila-yumminess) and my husband had a beer. His glass had some lipstick on it. Kinda awkward, but we aren't the kind of people to make a big hype about something stupid so we just let that one go. We shared the guacamole...awesome, creamy, flavorful. I ordered the Arrachera (skirt steak) which was good. Not as flavorful as I hoped but still good. The only negative with my meal was I wasn't given a steak knife. Kinda weird? Seems like most places pick up on that necessity, but no one seemed to notice I was getting an arm workout cutting my steak with my butter knife. Oh well. Not a big deal. My husband got the lechon asada. Also good...although he said the yuca puree was extremely rich and almost like a block of cream cheese. The dish, overall however, was really good. We shared the brussel sprouts and truffle mash for sides, both really good and came in little clay pots to share. Portions were HUGE. We took some home for the next day. Service was great, and atmosphere was really unique and well done. Bright and fun but not too tacky. It's a huge place.

I made reservation and arrived 10 min before my time. We waited in the lounge area which gave off a super chic vibe. A little dim and people in suits. It started off good. Then we where sat just at our reserved time. We walked in through these long curtains and into the main floor. It was beautiful. Their was so much color and light plus music all around... Dun dun dun here comes the not so good part. We got sat at a table for two in between already two couples at opposite sides. I could literally touch my neighbors faces if I extended my arm. Ugh what a bummer. The party to my left was incredibly loud and to top it off annoying! Mid dinner I had to listen to these two potato sacks discuss payments and micromanage the bill. Boo. Okay so we started off with one lobster bisque to share and the guacamole. The bisque was way to salty and had a very strange pungent taste. I didn't like it one bit. The guacamole and chips were decent enough. You can't really mess up mashed avocado, onions, and cilantro. Next was our entree's I had the Arrachera/skirt steak M.  It was absolutely delicious. It was incredibly tender and moist. Which I believe to be hard to do with skirt steak. It was a very appropriate portion that sat on top of rice and beans. My boyfriend on the other hand had the paella. To be quick and to the point the paella was flavorless and it had a very fishy taste. Like reheated sea food. I was so disappointed. Womp womp womp.  Anywho I ordered their banana pudding and chocolate cake as dessert to go. The desserts where the most disgusting sweets I had ever tasted in my life. The banana pudding was watery and had no real bananas incorporated. Just added as garnish on top. The chocolate cake was inedible. I threw it out. It tasted sour and chalky. I cannot say enough bad things about that chocolate cake. This place is overpriced and I mean no exaggeration. I felt robbed when I left the restaurant.

Seven of us work buddies were checking this place out for restaurant week, and for two of the coworkers birthdays.   None of us had ever been, but I guarantee all of us will be back.  This place was beyond great and is now in my top 5ish places in Chicago. A few of us arrived early, like 4:30ish, to have some pre-drinks at the bar.  Scott, the bartender, was knowledgeable, helpful, and makes awesome drinks.   I started with the raspberry mojito, even though I am normally not a huge mint fan, but it wasn't too minty, strong but good.   Another friend got the Bourbon Whisperer - and if you are a fan of bourbon, I would highly recommend.    The coconut mojito was also a group favorite.   I switched to their sangria for dinner and it is some of the best. The bar area is pretty spacious.  Very cool seating and lighting.  There were only a handful of people in the place, but I imagine it gets packed on the weekend.    Then I had to pee.   Bathroom was downstairs - which aggravates me.   I don't like drinking and then have to manage stairs.   Anyway, you can get to the bathroom from the bar area or the restaurant area - I suggest exploring both avenues as the artwork is different and you don't want to miss out on the photo booth ($4.00).   We worked our way to the basement, down winding halls plastered with photos, very boudoir-ish, sexy, and fun.   We were probably down there a good 10 minutes checking everything out.   Bathroom was huge, clean, classy, and cool.   We then moved into the restaurant for dinner.  Our waiter was Javier and he was pretty good with service and describing the menus.   None of ended up doing the $33 restaurant week menu - just because we wanted a variety of appetizers and no one really wanted dessert.   The guacamole, calamari, and Ropa Veija were all outstanding, as was the shrimp and tuna ceviche's.    More drinks were had, more food was ordered.  Again, there was not one bad or disappointing dish. We finished dinner around 8pm, and the place was never more than 50% full.   I was surprised by this, but maybe the weather was a factor.   They played a mix of music and the atmosphere is amazing and bright and an eye-popping WOW for your senses.   Really, a very cool place to drink, eat, and enjoy.    I highly recommend!!",0.9989,0.687,0.263,0.05,0.6460617283950617

Usually it's bland, overrated, and overpriced (hello, Green Zebra).  Carnivale was a bright spot, for sure! I got the Senator's chicken, which was incredible.  The chicken comes on a bed of french fries, which are really really good, especially with the citrus butter My husband got the polenta, which he said was delicious but the tomato sauce on top tasted like the red sauce he makes when he's drunk.  The pesto on the side was really nice and smoky.  I loved the cilantro.   We also got the guacamole, which was surprisingly tasty (but seriously, $8 for guac?).  For dessert we got the cobbler, which was really good.   The only things that would make me hesitate are the price, the wait, and the lounge decor.   But mostly the price. I'm a cheap bastard.  I'd pay the same price for the chicken (it was so good!), but the guac and drinks were, in general, way !! overpriced.   But the aged rum flight was really reasonable ($17 for a lot of really good rum); I'd probably just go with that next time instead of any other drink.   We were only in the lounge, since we didn't get a reservation (lesson learned--it took us 45 minutes to get a table).  It kind of reminded me of a hotel bar.  I have happily paid extra for a nice dining area/bar in the past, but I wouldn't at Carnivale.",0.9869,0.781,0.17,0.049,0.6497222222222223

I had one rum flight and two tequila flights, and my sea bass was really good. However, the service here was really disappointing. We get there at 8:30 PM. I knew we would have to wait because it was crowded when we got there. This was a Saturday night. We had 9 PM reservations. We check in, and, of course, we were told that we would be seated around our reservation time. Now, when we initially walked in, there was a coat check as we got up the stairs. The irl at the front didn't even bother to offer to check our coats. I mention this because she offered to check the coats of every other group that walked through the door. So, 9:15 PM gets here, and I walk up to hostess to ask how much longer we would have to wait. She was completely rude. First, she didn't look me in the face, so I basically had to tell her to look up while she's talking because it's a matter of respect. Then, she proceeds to talk to me in a very unflattering tone, telling me that she would get to my reservation when she could. I am not a violent person, but it took everything in me to not slap her. We finally et seated around 9:20 PM. We didn't finish our meal until 11:15 PM. Why? Our waiter was slow as molasses.

It used to come on a plate with thick plantains under each little pile of meat with sauce drizzled on top. They turned it into a little taco like thing with the plantain as the taco shell. It seem more like taro to me. The meat does not melt in your mouth like it used to and the sauce does not taste the same. Very disappointing since that was one of the things we were looking forward to eating. They also changed the main entree ""Churrasso"" not sure if I spelt that correctly, but it's close enough. I'm not sure what they did to it but it does not give the same wow as it used to. The sea bass we had was delicious. Never had that here before so I can't say if they modified it in any way. Another disappointment was the Carnivale Ice Cream Cake. It looks more artsy, but you get a lot less. Also the flavor of the ice creams are a little different.   Not sure if I can come back.

2014-01-12,3.0,"~ The Vale ~ I've gone from Carnivale to now crestfallen into The Vale.  I'd been to Carnivale four or five times before my latest visit. It was always consistent and a go to favorite. Well, nothing lasts forever, and Carnivale has now sunken into the vale now as far as I'm concerned. That's not to say it's bad, but when your expectations of an experience being the same as it was in the past aren't met you're not going to walk out with five stars in your eyes.  Let's start at what's not changed and what's still good - the ambiance and the loose, party atmosphere. You'll still get a little Latin and want to start shaking your rump at Carnivale. That's definitely still the case. But the rest of the experience just didn't go to the heights to which it had gone in the past for me. I should have known right out of the gate there could be a problem when I ordered my usual darling, the white sangria. ""We don't have that anymore."" Boom. Little did I know that would be the first shot across the bow and harbinger of this particular dining experience. We went for the pitcher of red sangria instead. When it came out, my first thought was that we were going to be completely bombed.  Nothing doing.  The pitcher of red sangria consisted of approximately five full glasses of drink. The menu indicated it contained red wine, triple sec and brandy. Nobody tasted any alcohol. And nobody ever felt any alcohol either. If there was any alcohol in that pitcher it must have been applied with a drop applicator. I was still sober enough to walk a tightrope across the Kennedy upon departure.  Next, the ropa viejo is now totally changed. Previously, it came out on a plate as one piece. Now, you get five mini tacos which stand upright in slats with spaces between them. I imagine this is done to deceive the customer in that it's obviously less food now than it was previously. These mini tacos are basically the size of a stuffed Jose Ole taco like you see in the store. They're twelve bucks for five of them. That's about $2.50 per mini taco. I can't remember if ropa viejo was twelve dollars on prior visits or not, but you're almost certainly getting less ropa viejo now. Still, it is delicious.  For the main courses, we had the pork chop and the Senator Chicken. The pork chop was always delicious in the past. Well, the past is now definitely further into the past. The pork chop on this occasion didn't measure up anywhere close to the pork chops in the past. The Senator Chicken was the surprise and the ultimate big winner of the night, with a delicious sweetish sauce over sliced chicken breast and fries and an extraneous mini chicken leg on the side which went untouched.  As to the prices, the pork chop, I believe, was formerly $24 and the chicken, I believe, $20. The pork chop is now $29, and the chicken is now $24. That's a 20% increase in just 18 months according to my memory.  Service was perfect, as usual. A manager came by to check on things, but I'm not high maintenance or the type to make a fuss about my meal while at the table so I just nodded that everything was fine.  I walked out in disbelief at how things had gone from Carnivale to The Vale in a bit less than 18 months' time.  As I know from prior visits to Carnivale, nothing lasts forever.  It pains me, but I have to shave off two stars for you, Carnivale. I actually might have to be done with you. I'll try to remember the good times. That's just going to be hard right now.",0.9937,0.861,0.103,0.036,0.4531576236263736

My wife has the Churrasco (Wood grilled beef tenderloin) which she enjoyed very much. (she is planning her own review so I won't go into detail on it) If you would like to try one of their adult beverages, I recommend the Carnivale Martini. Our waitress Kate was very knowledgeable about the menu and was ready with a recommendation of her favorites.  She was friendly and attentive.  She made the dining experience definitely more enjoyable.

Overlarge, brightly colored lamps and mirrors give off a fun, eclectic vibe. Diners of all shapes, sizes and ethnicities crowd around tables, enjoying excellently made cocktails and delicious plates of food. The beautiful wait staff seems to be everywhere, ready to take your order or refresh your beverage. I half expected to see a White Rabbit scurry out from behind the bar. Be sure to take advantage of the bar's libations. Their mojito is top-notch, and the strawberry caipirinha is brilliant, with fresh strawberries adding just a hint of sweetness to a powerful drink. LIke many other diners, I heartily recommend the ropa vieja. I enjoyed it for my main meal, although it's listed as a starter course. The guacamole and chips are a nice way to get things going, and a large charcuterie plate received raves as well. I especially enjoyed the jamón serrano. The ceviches alone are worth a trip to Carnivale. Our table opted for the ceviche tasting, which includes all four, and while they were each quite tasty, my favorite by far was the Mixto. Shrimp, calamari, octopus, red onion, cilantro, and lemon oil combine for a glorious flavor combination. If you're a fan of banana cream pie, do yourself a favor and try the one at Carnivale. It's made with an oreo crumble crust and you'll taste the freshness of the whipped cream. Another fun treat is the cotton candy, served on a house-made caramel corn stick. Too sweet for my taste, but it makes a great conversation piece. Much of Carnivale's menu is gluten free, so be sure to notify your server of any food allergies.

2013-10-31,3.0,"I really want to give Carnivale a 5 star review. The place has so much excellence, and that excellence shines in every aspect on occasion. Unfortunately, the atmosphere and service is hit or miss. And when you consider the prices on the menu, that isn't acceptable for an establishment of this caliber.  ' I'm not finicky about things that ""come with the territory"". An outside restaurant too loud due to traffic? Fine, there's nothing they can do to change that. Is the shrimp not fresh in a seafood restaurant in Wyoming? Well, who the hell would walk into a seafood restaurant in Wyoming expecting fresh shrimp?  The food at Carnivale, while not always an all around grand slam, is still 5 stars. If your side is ""alright"", you won't care because your main dish will be incredible. The decor is unique and loud, but never crosses the line into obnoxious. Think- high end restaurant in Vegas (that's a good thing).  The atmosphere and service? This is where I get confused, and ultimately frustrated. The waitstaff is friendly, approachable, and never miss a beat on your order. But sitting at our table with no visit for 30 minutes after our food was bused off both after dinner and desert didn't exactly lighten moods. I don't care how great your atmosphere is, you should never assume that a group of people want to sit in your restaurant for nearly 4 hours. And while I'm on atmosphere, WHY IN THE WORLD would anyone think it would be a good idea to have a (great) jazz trio playing in the attached bar area while blasting salsa in the restaurant area. The result was spending 4 hours in what sounded like a pseudo-Brazilian Guitar Center. Again, I'm not finicky. But these aren't things that you should expect or have to adapt to. These are results of poor management. When I taste the food, look at the art, hell, even appreciate the unique and lovely bathroom, I just think: ""How is it possible, in a restaurant so well conceptually designed and executed, that the atmosphere and service could learn a few things from Denny's?"" If I visit Carnivale again, I hope to be motivated to modify my review to the 5 stars they're so close to deserving.",0.6804,0.762,0.123,0.115,0.5741397849462365
2013-10-30,3.0,"What a difference a couple years makes.  The prices at Carnivale have skyrocketed. I paid somewhere around $25.00 for the Churrasco a couple years ago. Tonight? $38.00. Last time we got liquor with our dish and paid somewhere in the mid $70 range. Tonight, we passed on drinks and still paid over $90.  Worse yet, I couldn't even attribute the price-jacking to an improved dish. It was worse, much worse. I requested the steak medium-rare it came back very rare. Had to send it back, but they did fix that no questions asked. What they couldn't fix was the awful puree and spinach surrounding the otherwise decent steak. The tartness of the puree was overpowering and it killed this traditional dish for me. I've had Churrasco at several different Latin restaurants (all of which were not as upscale as Carnvale) and they were all better than Carnivale.  On a more positive note my partner's paella was delicious (but again overpriced) and the ropa vieja (spelling?) appetizer was excellent.

When we arrived 30 min early we were told to wait and given a buzzer. So 30 min passed by people that came in after us were seated. Then we waited 45 min total I walked up and asked what was going on bc I had reservations made and we have not been seated, and other people were seated that were after us. I informed her of my reservation showed her my open table confirmation and was told that in house reservations take priority and open table is not always accurate. To me it sounded like a cop out and the hostess was rude. We waited another 25 min before we were seated.

The food is mostly tepid and bland. The meatball appetizers were a hit, but the guacamole was boring and we had to ask three times for chips. The cheese plates - despite the promise of artisanal origin - were bland. The empanadas were heavy on the pastry. The paella was completely dried out - only the grape tomatoes provided any relief.

2013-10-13,5.0,"Arrachera skirt steak, I still have dreams about you.  Mmmm goodness.  We came on a Saturday night, a little early, sat at the bar while our table was being prepared.  I'm a fan of the Moscow Mule, and to be honest most places don't make it very well, some add sprite to it and mess up the whole drink.  The Mule here my friends is pretty darn good.  How good?  I can't remember how many I drank, that good. We were celebrating a few b-days, we got a nice table in the back, a little more quiet, romantic-y, private.  The server was nice, attentive, but not knowledgeable.  He said all of their food is local (maybe), and organic (definitely not), with many spices grown on their roof top (hmm, their roof is right next to the expressway, how good can those spices be, if they grow next to smog of all smog).  I have a pet peeve with people referring to stuff as ""natural"" or ""organic"", when they have no clue what it is.  A $26 skirt steak meal can not be organic, the meat alone would cost more.  Nevertheless, it was delicious, juicy.  Although I'm not a fan of rice & beans, these were cooked in some bacon sauce thingy, that made them pretty good, especially accompanying the steak.  In a Latin infused place, I expect stuff like guacamole to rock.  It was bland, not spicy, not oniony, not jalapeño-y.  The sevice appetizer was good however. Desserts...negative.  Skip them and go elsewhere.  The person who actually told me about Carnivale boasted about the deserts and for everyone to order a different one so we could taste how wonderful each was.  They weren't.  Just standard, nothing special.  Actually, reminded me of a cake you could buy at dominicks, that sat in plastic packaging for a few days, just not super tasty.   Our server was nice, remembered we were there to celebrate b-days and brought out cotton candy and caramel corn with candles, it was a nice touch. Lastly, after all those Moscow Mules, I girl had to tinkle, and low and behold you have to take 2 flights of stairs down (think industrial, all metal, escape stairs).  I stood there thinking if I was going to make it.  I did.  However, the servers bring food up and down those stairs as well, and they are running.  I say one more Mule and we'd have quite of few steak and beans massacred over that stairwell.",0.9949,0.782,0.175,0.043,0.49688529499850276

Full of energy and recommendations. I'd already been told about the Ropa Vieja but he also recommended the Veal Empanadas. Excellent choice as well. My taste buds are still tingling. If you're with a big enough party, I recommend everyone ordering something different and then share family style. That way you can try multiple menu items. We ordered the paella, the salmon, the arracherra and the senators chicken. Each dish was delicious but everyone at my table agreed the arracherra was the best of them all. Grilled skirt steak with the best chimichurri sauce I've ever had. Yum!  The Senators chicken had a citrus butter sauce with a little bit of kick that was just right.  The salmon with a creole mustard glaze was ok not bad but I'm not sure I'd order it again. Same for the paella. Just needed a little more spice.

2013-09-28,5.0,"We had our ceremony and reception at Carnivale in June 2013.  It was AMAZING!!!!  I cannot say enough good things about the venue and their staff.  My wife and I are extremely critical, very demanding, type A personalities.  We had high expectations for the evening, and we were blown away.   First, the staff.  I have never seen a staff work so hard to set up and execute an event.  The professionalism and work ethic of every member of the staff was unparalleled to anything I have ever seen.  Most of the venues we explored automatically added gratuity of anywhere between 18-22%.  It was worth every penny at Carnivale.  The food was served with military precision.  It was maybe 5 minutes from the first plate going down to the last.  Can't say enough good things about the service. Second, the food and drinks are unbelievably delicious at Carnivale.  The short ribs and pork shoulder were fall apart tender, and the flavors... wow.  Everything was hot and fresh.  The drinks are addicting, so watch out.  I love their mojitos and my wife loves their margaritas. Third, the venue.  We lived in Chicago for a few years and wanted an urban feel to our wedding.  We wanted a fun, bright, relatively casual, unique atmosphere where people could have a good time and relax.  Carnivale is that venue.  This is definitely not a blank canvas banquet hall.  All the bright colors and decorations throughout the restaurant made for amazing wedding photos.  We also elected to have our ceremony there so people didn't have to travel to another place while we were taking pictures (and avoid Chicago traffic!).  The venue is perfect for wedding ceremonies.  They set up pastel chairs in the main dining area with the wedding party standing in front of this huge mural.  Very cool.  And if you want the bride to have a truly dramatic entrance, have her walk out from the top of the stairs.  Gives me chills every time I think about it. Fourth, the wedding coordinator (Alison).  Alison is amazing!!!!!!  Did you notice all the exclamation marks?  Yes... amazing.  The only negative to the whole planning process was that our first two coordinators left (which worked out in the end).  Alison was the third person to be assigned to our wedding, and we were, not surprisingly, a bit frustrated at first.  However, she handled it wonderfully and with professionalism.  She understood the process, costs, and had great suggestions to make sure everything went smoothly.  Any time I called or emailed her, she got back to me within the day.  She also helped coordinate everyone the day of.  She queued the music guy, signaled us for when we were supposed to walk out, where to stand, etc...  Everything went off without a hitch.   To sum it all up, Carnivale was the perfect wedding venue, and we had a blast.  People were coming up to us all night and saying how amazing everything was (food, service, decorations, etc...) and how they had never been to anything like that.  In fact, I have had a few family members call me after attending other weddings and say 'it was nice, but it was no Carnivale'.  We are so glad we chose Carnivale for our wedding.  It would have been an amazing day regardless of where we had it scheduled, but having it at such a wonderful venue made it all the more special and memorable.  If for nothing else, go there and get a drink to see a very unique space.",0.9948,0.843,0.127,0.029,0.5521553287981856

It's difficult to even put into words what an incredible space this is, and photos really do not do it justice. From the moment we walked through the door, we knew that this special mixture of color and light and sound and vibe was the right place for us! And we weren't the only ones to react to the ambiance : every single guest at our wedding told us that it was the best they had been to! Really, the deal doesn't get better than this! After looking into other spaces and options around Chicago, we had the pleasure to meet with Ali, who showed us around and who was such a pleasure to work with while we planned and coordinated the event. Coordinating the wedding from the East Coast threw up so many obstacles-- some anticipated, some not-- but Ali's professional and prompt responses to all of my (many) queries, as well as the simply perfect backdrop that the space provided, always allowed us to take a sigh of relief knowing that even if everything else failed, everyone would eat and drink well in a beautiful venue. I received so many comments on the food and beverages from the guests, most of whom were anticipating the standard sparse and underwhelming wedding fare and were so pleased with the delicious and generous entrees  they received instead.  Additionally, the staff was simply lovely. They were tremendous! Everyone was kind and warm and the whole show, once it was placed in their hands, ran like clockwork. Ali kept a cool head throughout the whole weekend and was always available to help guide us along the process.

No good restaurant is worth its salt without fabulous cocktails and Carnivale does just that.  The margaritas are of course top notch.  If you are a tequila afficianado this is your place.  With their page long list of tequilas alone you are bound to find something to suit your palate!

The lechon asado was rich and tasty with a creamy yuca puree balanced by the red cabbage; it is different but not too far outside the box.   Dessert : If you must, get the cotton candy, but you would be better off getting the Chocolate Cigar. Very clever and something different. Just get it !   Service was amazing. There was a problem with one dinner entree and management took care of it promptly. In fact, they came over twice and made an adjustment on the bill without us asking.  This is a real nice place, casual and fancy attire. Nice staff. I can't say enough about the experience on Saturday night 8/25/2013.  In closing, valet is $5, whether you have a Focus or Bentley.",0.9952,0.753,0.233,0.014,0.635632183908046

I will say that the decor and ambiance of Carnivale is exciting and beautiful; definitely worth seeing, but I truly expected more; most specifically better food.. based on all the rave reviews.  Our meal consisted of Tacos de Pescos, Paella, and Arrachera. The fish tacos were good; the favors mixed well, and the Paella was decent, not much to brag about. Unfortunately the Arrachera (skirt steak) was not very great! it did not have much flavor, and wasn't as succulent as authentic homemade Arachera should be. I was disappointed. The service was lacking as well; a waiter with the same tired, old sales pitch who only comes around every 30 min tp check on you.  I believe Carnivale spent more time and effort making a beautiful restaurant with several rooms, banquets and staircases then tackle on the concept of providing excellent food.

It's the perfect spot to start a night out on the town. The food was exceptional. We had chips and guacamole to start. Although I didn't have any due to my own dietary restrictions, I heard the guacamole was incredibly fresh. Everyone who got a cocktail seemed very pleased with their order, particularly the coconut mojito.  For dinner I had the special, which was garlic rubbed halibut with a coconut sauce over carrots and fingerling potatoes topped with beets. I don't even like beets and I ate every single bite. It was so incredible I was tempted to lick the remnants of the coconut sauce off the plate. Although I didn't sample anyone else's food, it was rave reviews all around for everything from the chicken to the salmon to the ceviche, and even multiple appetizers ordered as entrees. For dessert we shared the organic strawberry cotton candy with caramel corn, which was a fun and tasty option. The abuelito's hot chocolate was heavenly.  Although I don't live in Chicago, I would definitely reccomend this restaurant and would return when I'm in the city next. The only negative about our experience was that service was fairly slow.

2013-06-24,5.0,"Carnivale gets better and better every time I go.  Since my last visit {back in '11} a new chef took over the kitchen and is mixing up some new and delicious meals.  As far as I'm concerned nothing has changed and just about everything I consumed was fantastic.  First up was the Mango Margarita ($9.50) - mixed to order and served in a tall frosted glass.  So delicious it made ordering a 2nd (3rd, 4th... ) round veryyyy easy.  While we sat in the bar and waited for the rest of our party, our bartender brought us over a lovely bowl of super creamy guac ($8).  Fresh avocados, little bit of tomato and onion and a whole lotta pepper it had just the right amount of kick.  And the chips had just enough salt sprinkled on top to contrast with the creamy guac.  Yum!  And if you love cilantro... double yum!   Over at the table we ordered up a handful of appetizers.  While some in the group were eying the Calimari and Spanish Octopus, I was all over the Ropa Vieja {braised beef in a sweet plantains shell, with some aioli & yummy queso}  Sooo glad I ordered them.  While the beef could have been served a little warmer- I loved the melt-in-your-mouth tenderness of it.  And the plantain ""taco"" shell was genius.  I really enjoyed every single bite.  For $11 you get 4 bite-sized tacos (about 2"" each). For the main course I ordered up the Churrasco {Nicaraguan style wood grilled beef tenderloin, yuca charcoal, smoked garlic mojo, herb chimichurri $36}, as per the recommendation of our waitress when I asked for something lean & not so fatty..  The meat looked deeeelish when it was first put in front of me, but when I first sliced it open I found a whole lotta bright pink.  After a few minutes I was able to flag someone down, who promptly took it to the kitchen.  My now-cooked-perfectly tenderloin showed up just a short time later, brought over by one of the managers who took an extra minute to explain to me the meal... those 'yuca charcoal' referenced above are yucas with a dusting of blackened seasoning.  Don't let their appearance fool you; while they appear burnt I can assure you they are not.  In fact they were really good- especially with that scrumptious garlic sauce.   Unfortunately the yuca's lost their appeal after my 2nd bite of the beef tenderloin.  I'm, not even sure I could put into words how good this piece of meat was.  Even though I asked for it well done it was sooo moist, so easy to cut and covered in an amazing chimichurri sauce.  I would order it again in a heartbeat. Following dinner the group decided they needed some dessert.  They chose the Organic Strawberry Cotton Candy with Caramel Corn.  While I'm not a big fan of cotton candy I needed to see what ""organic cotton candy"" tasted like.  FYI- it taste the same as the regular.  The caramel corn was good though, just enough sweetness..  and it went well with my after-dinner-drink of lemoncello. Oooh boy do I love me some lemoncello.  Little lemon + a little honey + infused with clove, graham cracker & almond.  So smooth & the $4 ""single"" they serve is just the perfect amount, I don't think I could have drank the double.

Overall I think Carnivale is pricey for what you get.  For $20-$30 an entree, I think you can do better.",0.9888,0.742,0.233,0.025,0.5173291925465838

I can't say I'd go back when I'm in town again.  I made the mistake of trying the coconut mojito per the waitresses suggestion. Wasn't a big fan, stick with the regular mojito or maybe a raspberry if you're feel ing really daring. We got a few tapas and split an entree.  Guacamole - pretty good guac for the mid-west! Note, they'll ask you if you want 1 or 2 avocados go with one if you have less than 4 or 5 people. One avocado made a ton of guacamole, the two of us had a ton left over.  Ropa Viejo - REALLY GOOD! Probably the best thing we ordered. There were four or five on the plate so a good dish to split amongst a small group.  Main dish: Churrasco. Pretty good, definitely more than enough for two people to split. The sauce and yuca charcoal was delicious and the stake was actually cooked to order.  Sides: Caramelized Plantains - SO GOOD.  Creamy Quinoa - Good, but we could've done without if I had to do it all over again. Overall, the place is just way too over-priced for the quality of food.

It was the first dish I've sent back in a restaurant in as long as I can remember. To say that the service was lacking is an understatement, and the drinks pale in comparison to the offerings at other establishments of a similar price point. Want a great coconut Mojito?

2013-05-15,4.0,"Came for a business dinner and it was a very fun and vibrant/colorful environment. Had to wait for my party so sat at the bar and tried the coconut mojito. It was pretty good but does not taste like your typical mojito (coconut.. duh) The waiter was very prompt in the beginning and knew a lot about the menu. The busser never allowed my drink to be empty or a mess to be in front of me. I also got the smokey bear drink and was not a fan, another mojito please! Ropa Vieja - it was good, but not as good as all the reviews mentioned.. maybe I hyped it up too much for myself. I'd say you should order it just to try. Guacamole - it was a HIT at my table. I think we had 3 orders of it. I'd let the waiter know you want extra chips beforehand because they almost give you nothing compared to the guac. Mushroom flatbread - DELICIOUS! I think it was my favorite appetizer because the mushroom was just so good (even though I am not a fan of whatever cheese comes on it) Ceviche tasting - it was good.. but definitely not worth 25 bucks! Salmon was eh.. shrimp ones were good and I enjoyed the calimari ceviche as well. Short Rib - the meat is so soft and tender with a ton of flavor. I definitely did not enjoy any of the sides it came with though. Arrachera - the skirt steak was good, but nothing mind blowing. I liked the short rib more due to texture. The rice & beans were very good though. Yuca side - eh.. not worth it. Truffle Fries - good but I did not really taste any truffle or ""smoked ketchup"" Creamy Quinoa - I think I'd be a fan if I was a fan of quinoa. Overall, a fun experience with pretty good food.

They had apologized for the misunderstanding and miscommunication that happened. I am happy that they got in touch to straighten things out and know the details of it. I change my review from a 2 star to a full 5 stars because they go above and beyond to make sure the customer has a good experience, even after they leave their doors.  In that sense, that gives me respect for a business to make sure a customer is happy. Not many can do that, but the people at Carnivale, especially the manager, do just that.  ----------- I really enjoyed the food, atmosphere, feeling and the services of the waiters. They took care of us and everything was great.  Though the owner had come out to applaud us for the graduation we just came from, the owner told us we were to get free deserts but didn't deliver until we were about to leave.

First off, walk in and instantly get a great vibe from the swank cocktail lounge that looks to be where people are waiting for tables, having a quick drink..the space as a whole too, has sort of a cool, morraccan type of feel to it and makes you feel like your somewhere in a warmer climate near a beach grabbing a cool drink from the warm sun.  That said, we get seated almost immediately, which was nice but this was where the service just made the whole thing less enjoyable. After sitting, we waited 7-10 min before even getting greeted and when we did, it took another 10 just to get our first round of drinks..now that said, in this in between time, never were we asked about the rest of our order at this time, it was about 5 min after our drinks came that we finally got to order our food. There were only 4 of us, and the cocktails we ordered were on the same level of a margarita, not too intense to make..that said, put in the food order, creeping on the 30 min already been there mark, and waited another 25 before the food did finally arrive. All this time, our server was no where to be found and honestly paid no attentiveness to us as his table. Now I am harsh too because I work in this industry, but your customers are your money, pay them some attention and make they have a good time more than just taking their orders from time to time.. Food was good, drinks were pretty good, honestly the poor service from timing to lack of food knowledge and attentiveness to our table really made this what could have been pretty great restaurant sub par in our book..",0.9904,0.764,0.164,0.072,0.6152702702702705
2013-04-27,1.0,"It was recommended that we go to Carnivale because my friend stated the food was outstanding. After my experience, I can say this place was a lot of things but far from outstanding.  We pulled up to the building and Valet parking was $5, which is not too bad for the city of Chicago to park.  We entered the building and it was colorful and whimsical.  The place was busy, but not too crowded.  Our party was seated within 5 minutes and greeted by a waitress who seemed annoyed with questions about the menu.     I had the flank steak, and it was average.  It was fairly tender but had some onions on top that were sour.  I have never had sour onions. What is going on in that kitchen? I digress.  My friends enjoyed their meals and one even almost swooned over the chicken.  The portions were fairly generous but the side items were à la carte, which seems odd for ""non-american"" cuisine. When I cook or have Latino/Caribbean food it usually is served with rice and beans/peas.   So the meal ends, and we order dessert.  This is when everything went wrong! One person ordered cotton candy and another ordered cake.  The bottom cake layer had pistachios and the top layer had passion fruit.  I kid you not, when I tasted the top layer of spoiled passion fruit, I almost had a violent and physical reaction. The cake had to have been spoiled, rancid, as if it was made with curdled milk.  It was like the top layer was drenched in vinegar, with a splash of bell pepper juice and expired onion sofrito. I grabbed my napkin, spit it out and tried to chew on it to rid my tastebuds of this great offense.  It was absolutely terrible and ruined anything that was remotely good about the meal.  When I contacted a staff member, who we believed was the manager, he said he would only charge us for the remaining 2/3 of the cake.  What? Really? Are you kidding?  We weren't interested in avoiding the cost on the bill, we were worried about the food safety of the product.  I will avoid this spot, and find Uncle Joes Jamaican and have some rice and peas next time.  The cake was just awful, and I mean awful.",0.9694,0.731,0.162,0.107,0.6102065826330532

Putting aside that I had an amazing time with an old friend; I just want to review the food... I ordered the churrasco , it was good but for the price of one plate I could've gone to a butcher store and ordered 5lb and made food for the whole family. Flavor wasn't unique, unless its for someone who doesn't cook.  Sweet Plantains.... What a joke, they r definitely from a frozen Goya box! Lmao Too much fancy terms for something that i do in a regular basis at home. I feel confident that I can throw a dinner party and invite people over. This restaurant was overpriced for the portions of the food and the supposedly uniqueness. Friendly advise, just put a sign at your doors as a disclaimer for any Latin American and Caribbean's to not even bother eating there.  I had to excuse myself to my friend and tell her that our food is being misrepresented and that there are better versions out there.  Omg, that sangria was sour and totally off!! Really! Sangria is a drink that needs to be prepared and put away at least for 2 hours before serving. The mess of sangria they served was just some cheap wine with chopped apples on top, nasty! Latinos are picky with how they serve their foods, please stop embarrassing us! Spain should have a field day with y'all.

2013-04-20,5.0,"Went to Carnivale for the first time last weekend with my boyfriend and his sister, who was in town from California. She chose the restaurant for his belated birthday celebration, and it was a fantastic choice!  First of all, this place really caters to parties! We arrived at the same time as a large group for a bar mitzvah. We were sitting next to two bachelorette tables, one of which was opening present after present of thong underwear. Upstairs, there was a wedding party. People were celebrating everywhere! It was a very fun, lively, colorful atmosphere, and it made me wish I'd had my graduation party there.  Second, the food and drinks were amazing! We ordered: 1) Ropa Vieja: Braised beef, sweet plantains, malanga, aji amarillo aioli, queso fresco; 2) Ceviche Tasting: Four types of ceviche; 3) Paella: Sea scallops, shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, bomba rice, Spanish chorizo, sofrito, tomato, peas;  4) Pernil: Maple Creek Farms braised pork shoulder, yuca purée, red cabbage, basil mojo, chicharron;  5) Short Rib: Espresso braised, caramelized root vegetables, kimchee fennel;  6) Organic Strawberry Cotton Candy with house-made caramel corn; and 7) Carnivale Ice Cream Cake: Passion fruit, guava, and pistachio ice creams, raspberry sauce. We weren't really sure what to expect with the ropa vieja, but it was essentially mini tacos. They were delicious! The beef was rich and tender, and all the flavors played off each other wonderfully. I could have eaten those for my main dish. The ceviche was so fresh and delicious! Probably some of the best ceviche I've had in the city. All the flavors were unique. Again, could have eaten a lot more. I ordered the paella. I've not had much paella in my life, but I thought it was great. My only complaint was the fish to rice ratio. However, I suspect that if it had more fish, the price would be much, much higher.  My boyfriend's sister ordered the braised pork shoulder. I didn't try any, but she really enjoyed it.  My boyfriend ordered the short rib. He's a slow-cooked-meats kind of guy. Very, very tender and tasty. I know he was not disappointed. We saw people carrying cotton candy around, and we knew we had to have it. Fortunately, it did not disappoint. Best cotton candy I've ever had! The ice cream cake was very tasty, although it was easily my least favorite dish of the evening (but seriously, it was yummy!). Just goes to show how great everything was.  Drinks and service were great. We had to wait 15 minutes before we were seated, but the hostess that sat us was extremely apologetic about the wait. A woman who appeared to be the owner came over mid-meal to ask us about our experience. Very attentive!

2013-04-18,5.0,"If you love #CubanCuisine, #Chicago's #Carnivale is something you have to check out. If you don't, it's something you have to check out.  APPETIZERS THE ROPA VIEJA- Usually an entree, this dish worked splendidly as an appetizer. The diced meat, plantains and salsa nestled in a chip is fun flavor and texture. Sweet and salty lovers- come hither.  THE OCTOPUS- Limey salted perfection. Great purée, tender potatoes , necessary olive oil drizzle...  new to the menu. Buenvenido! Good portions on both accounts. More than enough to wet your appetite but filling if you just walked in for a quick nibble. ENTREES We ordered plates that take longer to prepare but our waiter was kind enough to warn us.  Frankly, THE PAELLA was ok. I've had better. But in all fairness we did make a substitution.  We asked for no chorizo so when we found if wasn't seasoned boldly, we deducted this could be because the kitchen didn't compensate for the missing salt factor from the omitted sausage. Try it in its original version and let me know what you think. THE CHURRESCO. WAS. HEAVENLY. I'M TALKING PERFECTION, NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT, CAN I HAVE ONE GO TO PERFECTION.  Ordered medium rare and cooked so, to the nano-second. I barely needed my knife, the meat melted in mu moith (yes, talking with a full mouth). It paired so well with the crunchy charred yam that I neglected my side of plaintains ordered intentionally to accompany my meat.  This plate was all covered in Chimichurri fun, and spread on a mojo garlic mustard.  I could pass on the cherry vinaigrette, included for diping the yucu, but other than that, 6 STARS FOR THIS DISH ALONE. BTW- THE PLANTAINS were ok. Well caramelized but not ripe enough for my taste but admitedly Cubans prepare with a greener plantain than I am accustomed to. Besides, the plantains in ropa vieja were a tad more tender and our waiter graciously offered to strike the side order from the bill.  DESSERT  For the dessert portion of this meal, we ordered lattes and a dessert to share.   THE TRES LECHE LATTE was great but doesn't deserve it's name.   THE CAFE VANILLA LATTE however was the superior selection.  In both cases, the candied toppings sprinked in whip cream and floating on warm light lattes helped wind down our busy meal. Sweet coffee + salted whip cream = surprising taste board.  THE CHOCOLATE PEANUT BUTTER MOUSSE BAR was more chocolate than peanut butter, which made me very happy.  This, like all the dishes, was superbly presented, with the moose bar lying on an oreo wafer and a crunch stick skating on the whole production. The baton was passable but the powdered mousse bar stole the show and even contained actual peanuts, not just a butter base. Overall, this has been one of my favourite restaurants to try out on this Chicago leg. The bang-on food, the intoxicating music, the colourful decor, the friendly and gracious waiter service (down to how to get the most out of our leftovers) was all something to be remembered.  I RECOMMEND: Everything!!! But the ropa vieja is one of the best I've ever had. EXTRA TIP: To dine in the main dining area, make a reservation or be prepared to wait.

Their appetizer, ropa vieja, was our favorite until now that they changed it. They made it into some sort of tacos, the taste just isn't the same anymore.

I saw several other birthdays and they received their flan but we didn't. I hate to think they discriminate because we didn't order alcoholic beverages.

2013-03-23,3.0,"O-ver-rated. This place seemingly has all the ingredients to create a great Latin restaurant: lively crowd, bright colors, great smells wafting throughout the place, brightly-colored cocktails as far as the eye can see.  Unfortunately they fall flat on execution.  The Sea Bass Ceviche should have been awesome - unfortunately they created these little tastes with just too much going on to be tasty. Adding a ton of random stuff to a dish does not = a composed, tasty dish. We ordered the Churrasco, one of the (more expensive) steak dishes. We ordered it cooked mid, they gave us well. When you're paying $36 for a piece of red meat, you kind of expect it to be cooked properly. Let down. The ""charred"" charcoal-coated Yukka side they served it with was an interesting novelty, but just didn't taste very good. The bright orange sauce looked pretty, but was bland beyond belief. The Australian Lamb Rack was cooked well, and the sauce they serve with it was tasty, but I had a gripe with serving it on a bed of not-very-well-seasoned snap peas. Also everything was a little cold, like our food was sitting under a heat lamp for a little too long.  The Mojitos were ok, but with so many better places serving amazing Mojitos in the city (ahem Las Tablas), they come off as nothing special. The airplane-hangar large space gives off kind of a notably tourist-trappy vibe. Also with all that space it would be nice for them to separate the tables so that you're not eating on top of the people next to you.

The service at the bar was great too. When we were seated at our table, our server was running behind, so another server promptly greeted us and asked if we wanted to order drinks. He ended up being our pseudo-server for the next 10-15 minutes. When our server finally came to the table, she wasn't particularly warm or inviting. We ordered the larger portion of the guac, which our server said would be a good size for our party. We all ended up wishing we  had gotten the smaller portion, since we were all able to get third/fourth helpings of the guac. Because I was so full from the guac, I ordered two starters, the ropa vieja and the mac and cheese, for my entree. Both were good, but nothing out of this world.

2013-02-12,4.0,"Wow. Excellent meal. Now, being an admitted city and food snob, I originally assumed Carnivale was a tourist trap for suburbanites to go to after a day at Navy Pier or the Jersey shore type bro's to go to before heading out to Excalibur. And I definitely saw both there! Granted, it didn't help that it was Restaurant week, but there were definitely the older suburban groups and the aforementioned bro's (side-note- bro, your affliction button down is acceptable I guess, but tell your hot date that belly shirts and stripper heels are not really proper attire). Anyway, walk into the place with reservations and I end up waiting 30 minutes. I was about to say something when the buzzer rang and I was shown to my table. The decor was vibrant and the music was loud. Very different and definitely goes with their theme, but a bit too loud for good conversation. The place is huge - a nice change of pace to the typical long and narrow Chicago restaurant. I ordered off the regular menu (not the restaurant week menu). I had a tequila flight, shrimp ceviche, and braised short ribs. All were EXCELLENT. Some of the best ceviche I've ever had. The braised short ribs rival Aria's. And the potatoes under the short ribs were probably the best I've had.  The total came up to more than I was expecting, and I was pretty full (good portion sizes) so I skipped desert. I'll order desert the next time I'll go back...and I'll definitely go back! So yes, some of my assumptions about carnivale were true - customers range the gamut of all of chicagoland.

Round 2: I came in for restaurant week - they had a prix fix menu. The salad was pretty good, the candied nuts and cheese kind of saved it though. The market fish was, again, just bland. Friends had the soup and steak, both were good, but everything tasted like the only seasoning used was salt.  For the price tag, you can get much better food elsewhere... much better.

2013-01-22,4.0,"Celebrated my husband's birthday in December at Carnivale. It was my husband, 7 year old son and I on a Friday night. There aren't a lot of kids because of the atmosphere, but our son eats everything and enjoyed it. We started out with the Ropa Veija and the Guacamole. Both were awesome.Then for dinner the 3 of us shared the 3 P's: Paella, Pollo & Plantains. I had ordered the Pollo before and loved it. It did not disappoint. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the Paella was. The scallops were enormous. We finished with red velvel cake that was good but not great. I must mention the drinks at Carnival are great too the Raspberry Mojito & Chinga beer are our favorites. The only reason there are 4 stars is because of the issue at payment. I had received a gift certificate that I used, and also brought a coupon for a free appetizer I had received for being part of their e-mail distribution. When paying they accepted both, but I was informed they were both promotional and normally they do not accept both. Turns out the gift certificate we received as a gift was bought from a site sold at a lesser amount. Problem is, no where on the gift certificate does it state this or have any terms or conditions. I would have gladly paid if I had known, but did not like the condescending nature that we were told. We were celebrating and spending a decent amount, tipped on the total so I felt the manager who informed us could have been a little more gracious and explained the situation.

She was energetic, funny, and came to us just enough times that we didn't feel like she was checking up on us every 2 seconds. Good service really does make the restaurant experience that much better! There were a lot of great things on the menu - but we were prepared by reading Yelp reviews to figure out which ones were the MUST-TRYS! We had the Ropa Vieja, Guac, Ceviche 3-tasting, the pollo entree, the special fruit dessert and a few drinks. Everything was DELICIOUS!! The appetizers came out super fast, and then there was a little downtime before the entree came for you to enjoy your drinks and get yourself ready to eat some more :-) Ropa Vieja - a great balance of saltiness and sweetiness.  Guac - richy, creaminess with big chunks of avocado. Would of love to see some peppers, onions to add a little crunch but still yummy! Ceviche - We got the oysters, and let Jenn decide on the other two - very fresh. Pollo - it was one entree that me and my boyfriend were going to share but they did the favor and plated it on two separate plates for us, beautifully decorated, you would have never guessed it was just one entree.  Dessert - It was the berries that were in seasons - so they had berry jam with an almond ice cream on top. TO DIE FOR!! Drinks were decently priced - good options. I had red sangria and a frozen margarita and I was already feeling nice.... :-) The whole meal only came out to under $100 before tip which BLEW MY MIND. I can't wait to come back to this place.

It was indeed very tasty, crisp and tangy. In the main course, we had Paella. We were not sure how the dish might turn out, as it had all sea-food, and was our first attempt. But even if you are not a big fan of sea-food but like meat in general, just go for it. It tasted well, spicy with rice. Shrimp ceviche was nice, again my first time. Shrimps were well marinated, crispy and enough portion for 5 of us. My cousin ordered New York style medium cooked steak. I don't usually eat steak, but I tasted from my cousin's portion, and that was tasty too. This steak attempt gave me the confidence to try steak at other places, it was that good.

Everything about it is perfect upon first encounter: fun concept, interesting Latin American menu, unique cocktails, huuuuuge, beautiful dining area. While the experience wasn't necessarily disappointing, I felt the food could have lived up to expectations a little better. My friend and I came early around 6 pm on a weekday night and were seated in a nearly empty dining room. Our server was great -- very attentive, very helpful. With some help from him, we ended up ordering the Guacamole, Ropa Vieja, Pernil, and Arrachera. I also went with one of their special cocktails, a Passionfruit Banana Caipirinha. The drink was good, but a little on the tart side. It could've used some more banana for better balance. The Ropa Vieja, which came out first, was unfortunately the highlight of the meal -- each bite is perfectly thought out, with an explosion of flavours and textures. Everything else was just okay. If I'm paying $8 for guac and chips those avocados better have pits of gold, but the guacamole, while fresh, was very bland. I've had better guacamole for $.50 from taco trucks in LA. The entrees were both disappointing. My Pernil, which came highly recommended by our server, was a mess. The pork shoulder was thinly sliced, dry, and overcooked beyond belief. Isn't braising supposed to make meat more tender?? The potato puree was already separating by the time it got to our table, and the sauce was tasteless. I liked my friend's Arrachera better, but she couldn't even finish it because the vinegar in it overpowered the taste of everything else. It's a shame the food at Carnivale wasn't nearly as grand as the venue would suggest. With the exception of the Ropa Vieja, none of our dishes were worth their price tags.

We were seated in the main dining room, which is GORGEOUS. So many bright colors! Our waiter was great; very friendly, and more than happy to answer the numerous questions I had about the menu. We started off with the chips and guac, which was great. Although I really can't think of a time that I had bad guac! We also had an empanada for a starter, which was pretty amazing. The only thing is that it's a bit small...but definitely very delicious! For our entrees I ordered the Pollo. Very good, and HUGE. Didn't exactly blow my mind, but still good. I'll probably order something else next time. My boyfriend ordered the Churrasco, which was recommended by the waiter. When he first got it, he looked a little disappointed, because at first glance, it isn't a whole lot of food (he's a big eater). But holy crap...was it delicious! I only tried a few bites, but it was really fantastic. And he actually said it DID fill him up by the time he was done. I would highly recommend the Churrasco, and I'll probably order that next time! We ended our night early, but next time I'd like to have a later dinner, because I got the feeling that it's a pretty trendy and fun place for a night out.

It is not just a typical salad.  The ingredients are simple but the flavor was superb.  One of the best salads I have ever eaten.     Garlic shrimp- to die for.   Pickled veggies- really liked the jicama.  The crunchy texture of the jicama was perfect for pickling.    Fried plantains-how could you go wrong.

Our group of six opted for cocktails and shared appetizers to avoid the inevitable food coma that results from ordering individual entrees since this was our first stop on our night out. On our table: caipirinhas, cotton candy martini, hendricks martinis, beer, large guacamole, arepas, empanadas, ropa vieja, short rib focaccia, shrimp ceviche, mac n cheese, flan and coconut mousse.  The star of the evening was the short rib focaccia. Savory, creamy, crunchy and fresh - all at the same time. Coming in at a close second was the coconut mousse served with a side of fresh tasting pineapple sorbet and served on basil puree. Tied for third place was the mac n cheese with bacon and the cotton candy martini. The mac for obvious reasons (bacon). The cotton candy martini - not because it tasted great (unless you like super sweet cocktails), but because it's just fun to watch them pour the liquor over a giant floof of cotton candy in a martini glass. The rest of the dishes were just okay. Didn't hate it, but didn't love it (except the caipirinha and Hendricks martini, of course). Of note, if you order the empanadas, eat that runny egg. It's more than plate decoration and is like gravy. Service was good. Water glasses always full. Plates promptly cleared. Waitress checked in regularly but not overly. Prices are what you'd expect.

One apologized and got the waiter to bring to bring it out. The manager came back, apologized for my dinner and the wine. Said they would buy us dessert. Wait, I don't like dessert! What about comping the the two glasses of wine that arrived at the end of the meal? Or maybe my terrible $30 dinner? We're still being nice so we smile and say thanks.  The dessert menu arrives and waiter says management will buy anything we want. I don't eat dessert so I order a dessert wine for $10, I'm told by waiter he'll have to ask management if that's okay. What happened to 'anything you want'? Now I'm seriously PO'd. We ordered a terrible rendition of Red Velvet cake that so mushy and weird that our party couldn't eat it and apple pie which was average. Then the bill was incorrect and overcharged so our waiter to be fix it. Of course, the $10 dessert wine was NOT comped. On a $260 bill and terrible experience, they didn't care enough to try to make it right!

The textures, layers of flavor, and beautiful presentation are all something that would encourage me to order again on a revisit.  For our entrees we had the Churrasco and the Chuleta.

The chili broth was very flavorful, little salty, but went well with the dish. The green beans were simply steamed and boring, needs work.  Churrasco was nicely smoked and perfectly cooked to mid-rare. Sweet potatoe puree reminded me just like what I make at home. Everything else in the dish was very tasty, plus a great presentation.

I dont know Latin cuisine very well and while I liked my last meal there, I decided to defer to our server for some help this time.   She asked me some questions about what I like and I very much appreciated this b/c usually servers will just point out their favorites or the most popular dishes. Her name was Andrea and she recommended the Arrachera after I told her what cuts of meats I liked and that I loved onions.  She did not steer me wrong! I think I will be getting this every time I eat at Carnivale. So Yummy!   I also think I will be asking for Andrea to be my server from now on. She felt like family. Very warm humor and seemed genuinley concerned with us having the best experience possible.  Having been a server in the past, I can be a tough critic when multiple courses are not timed well. We had Sangria for cocktails, Guacamole for an app, main courses, and split the chocolate cake for dessert.  Our cocktails came out shortly after we were greeted, which we were able to enjoy for 5-10 minutes before we received our guacamole, which was delicious! The main courses were only brought out after we were finished with the app and it was cleared from the table. No rush and no wait with any of the courses.   The atmosphere is fun and not cramped. The entire staff seems gracious to each guest and the prices are reasonable.  I will be returning often! Thanks Carnivale and Andrea!!",0.9977,0.664,0.268,0.068,0.5210810810810811

The ambiance in this place is the perfect backdrop for the wonderful food. Carnivale only uses fresh ingredients from local farms and you can definitely taste the freshness in their dishes.   We've tried the New York strip steak, spice rubbed chicken, wood grilled beef tenderloin, braised pork shoulder, barramundi, and the paella all of which are OUTSTANDING dishes.

I also enjoyed the high energy with all the vibrant colors...so ambiance and food get a 5/5. Now onto the bad...ABSOLUTE WORST SERVICE I have ever had at a restaurant.  If you go for dinner at Carnivale, I do NOT recommend Andrea the waitress.  Upon being seated, she took a very long time to order our drinks and serve them.  Once served drinks, she took a while to come back and check on us, see if we'd like to order, etc. I ordered guac and chips for the table (it was a party of 8 for my birthday), and asked to order our meals with it (because we noticed service is very slow).  She followed that by saying 'can you hold on one second?, turned around to a couple who arrived AFTER us and took their order.  She then left and came to get our table. Never saw the guac and chips after waiting about half an hour, so I asked if the order was coming out soon.  Her response was that she didn't receive an order for that. I told her it was ordered before the meals, and that was followed by not an apology, but backlash/attitude from her. She then brought the guac and chips and left.  She left us with empty drinks, not checking here n there if we were doing okay, etc. A friend asked for his drink twice, and she still hadn't brought it.  Once she finally came back, we asked for his drink, and that was followed by more attitude by her saying ""Did he REALLY ask for it twice?"" and walked away to get his drink. While waiting longer for our meals, we noticed the table next to us had a problem with her as well, and lo and behold a manager shows up to talk to them. Once our meals came out we asked for our bill right away because we had other reservations after and didn't think 2 hours would be too short a time for dinner at Carnivale- we were wrong.  Andrea forgot my mac and cheese and the bill, so by that time I was beyond ready to speak to management.  Multiple times my friends and I witnessed her (most likely) talking about us to another waitress, as she looked very annoyed. Eventually a manager came over, we explained everything. She adjusted our bill and we were able to remove the gratuity that was automatically included if we wanted to. You bet I took off her tip. Even AFTER talking to management, Andrea didn't even have the courtesy to apologize for anything. I also never received the complimentary trio cake being that it was my birthday.  So although the venue is gorgeous and the food was good, I was thoroughly disappointed with Carnivale and the damper they briefly put on my birthday celebration!",0.9605,0.856,0.094,0.049,0.4694179894179894

2012-08-20,4.0,"As part of my birthday celebration, my wife and I went to Carnivale this past Friday night. It was our first time eating here and we walked away with a high opinion and plans to revisit in the future.  For starters, the staff and waiters were very nice and helpful. We were seated within minutes upon check-in (we had 7:30PM reservations for 2) and were given a table on the second floor overlooking the main dining area. The space is beautiful. Formerly a warehouse, the place has been renovated with outdoor seating, a bar area and an adjoining main dining room with vaulted ceilings, brightly colored lamps, a huge glass mosaic and cool decorations. The atmosphere was fun and vibrant. Music was playing in the background during our meal but we didn't have any trouble hearing one another. In fact, it was just loud enough to drown out your neighbors and provide a little bit of conversational privacy. We had heard positiive reviews about their mixed drinks so my wife ordered the Coconut Mojito and I ordered the Mojito Millonario. Both were good; however, I was partial to my libation. It was a few dollars more than the regular Mojito but the 12 year estate rum they used was absolutely delicious and worth the extra expense. In addition to the rum upgrade, in the Millinario they add cava (spanish sparkling wine) and forego simple syrup, which is used in the regular mojito. This made for better flavor and kick in my opinion.  The food we ordered really hit the spot as well and was prepared perfectly. To start, we had the Arepas and the Ropa Vieja. Both had great flavor. The pork belly and corn cheese cakes in the former were a nice pairing. If I had to choose between the two though I would go with the Ropa Vieja. The braised beef and spicy mayo together with the other ingredients made for an incredibly tasty combination. Plus, in the RV they give you 4 little portions per plate compared to 3 on the Arepas dish. Regardless, you won't go wrong with either. For entrees we chose the Churrasco and the Bistek Palomilla. There was no clear cut winner in my mind because both dishes had unique and satisfying flavor profiles. The meat for both was cooked just right; tender but not bloody and easy to cut. My wife made the comment that the Churrasco tasted more latin american'esque while the Bistek Palomilla was more amorphous, although still excellent. She may have had a point. Regardless, the roasted mushrooms, radish salad and brisket mofongo disappeared quickly from my plate. The sweet potato puree and corn on her dish did compliment each other and the beef tenderloin very well. Since it was my birthday they brought us a free dessert, flan with bits of caramel popcorn on the plate. I didn't even see that option on the menu but it hit the spot. Definitely not the best I've ever had but since it was free I wasn't complaining. Had they not surprised us with this I would have ordered the Banana Cream Pie, which sounded awesome.

2012-07-24,2.0,"I had my wedding here about 2 months ago, and I wanted to make sure that I waited long enough to have a more level-headed, objective view of our experience before writing a review. So it's been long enough that my blood pressure doesn't spike at the thought of what happened, but I am definitely able to see that our experience was unacceptable and not at all what we paid (A LOT of money) for. The pros: the food was fantastic, the wedding coordinator was very organized and on top of everything, and the wait staff was very friendly and helpful Sounds like everything went ok, right? No. The cons: Our bartender was a huge jerk. We paid for a bar package that was supposed to span 6 hours. Yes, this is a long time...but it's what we paid for. After about 3-4 hours, he started telling everyone that the bar was only serving soda and water. I will admit that my drinks were fine, but we did hear from a number of guests that their drinks were watered down and very weak. The bartender kicked one of our friends out because he jokingly told him that he ""smelled funny"". He told my 250 lb friend who had 2 drinks that he had too much to drink, while my 110 lb cousin who had no less than a dozen drinks continued to be served. He was just flat-out rude. When we complained to the manager who was working that night, he blamed the coordinator for allowing us to have the 6 hour bar package and said she ""shouldn't have let us do that."" So we discussed a partial refund for the bar, and when we left for the night, it seemed likely that this would happen.  However, later in the next week, we got a call from a different manager who we had never spoken to or met before. He argued with me for about half an hour about how it was impossible that ANYONE at our reception had any less than 4-5 drinks. He even went so far as to claim that my parents and my in-laws lied to me when they said they only had 1-2 drinks. I'm not sure how this is good customer service, not to mention the fact that all of my parents (in-laws or not) had no reason to lie (and to suggest otherwise is WILDLY insulting). I also happen to know for a fact that I had only 2 drinks, so clearly it IS possible that people at the reception had less than 4-5 drinks...Nonetheless, he insisted that ""according to the numbers of drinks served, it is *impossible* that anyone did not have an excessive number of drinks"" and that we ""should be happy that they cut everyone off because we would have been liable for any lawsuits.""  Anyway, this is a MAJOR problem - we paid for a 6 hour bar package and only got at most 4 hours of service from a bartender who was rude, only to be topped off with a manager who argued with me that me and my parents are liars. Totally unacceptable. Another con: when we were packing up and leaving for the night, one of the managers brought out 3 big bags of things he said belonged to us. 2 of the bags were full of what appeared to be candy or fudge, and we thought it must have been a (very odd) gift, so we took them. The third bag, however, had a cake topper and stacks of place cards that were not ours in it. As soon as I saw this, I returned it to the restaurant. The next day, we realized that the other 2 bags of candy must have been guest favors for that same wedding. We drove all the way back to return the candy and again were put under the impression that we would receive a partial refund for the bar incident. Instead, a week later, all we got was a lot of arguing and rudeness. All of this is really unfortunate, as it put a permanent scar on what we remember about our wedding day. We will never go back to Carnivale again, and I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THAT ANYONE EVER HAVE AN EVENT THERE.",0.5562,0.805,0.101,0.094,0.524711681547619

The waiter knew every item in detail on the menu, including the wines. I was thoroughly impressed.  We ordered the cheese tray & Spanish olives. Very delicious. We ordered Salad, Halitbut & a vegetarian dish. The fish was so buttery it melted in your mouth. Literally. :) Everything was excellent. Loved the ambiance.

2012-07-10,1.0,"Absolutely disgusted on our wedding night. Great reviews, atmosphere, and food but the service was a ZERO.  3 hrs of sitting at a table waiting to eat. We had a reservation for a wedding party two weeks in advance and showed up with all in a limo at one time.  We discovered that we had one waiter who also had responsibility for other tables.  He took our drink orders, brought the drinks, took appetizer orders for some but not all people, had to be asked 3 times to refill drinks, and it took 15 mins and two requests with two waiters to get a Mojito.   After 1 hr and nearly eating the appetizers (for those who ordered), I walked across the restaurant to inquire about ordering our meals to which the server replied that he was waiting for all to finish their appetizers.  I told him that was ridiculous given the current wait for food, starving kids, and the time to cook a meal.  He then took meal orders which took another hour+ to receive.   I complained to the floor manager about the ongoing issues and delay in receiving food to which she concurred with all of my concerns and said she would get our food.  Later we discovered that other tables received bread baskets and we were left to sit with nothing.   They compensated our mass bill a small part and offered free dessert which we didn't accept.  Everyone was disgusted, ready to leave, and not willing to wait anymore.  Our limo was rented for a certain amount of time and we wasted 3 hrs in the Carnivale when the plan was much shorter to allow for time to ride Chicago and see the fireworks at Navy Pier.  Unfortunately time didn't allow and we went immediately to the hotel thanks to the lack of service at the Carnivale.    The beautiful atmosphere and wonderful food was appreciated by our mix of Hispanic/American/Asian friends, yet negatively impacted by the lack of service and attention to the needs of our wedding party.  Never again.  No excuse.",0.8746,0.77,0.125,0.105,0.4988571428571429

2012-07-06,5.0,"Carnivale was great.  I really had no genuine issues that would warrant less stars.  My only quirk, just to get it out of the way, was that its kind of in the middle of nowhere.  At least in my opinion.  Now on to the food/service: Had an 8:30 reservation, showed up at 8, and was seated immediately.  The waitress was extremely friendly, and VERY knowledgeable about not only the makeup of the menu items, but their origin as far as style (The cuisine is ""Latin Fusion,"" which is really more Cuban/South American than anything Mexican.)  They have a large selection of wines and a few solid beers.  Best of all, they have a wine flight for $12 that is basically 3 almost full glasses, of your choice. On to the food:  We got the Ropa Viejo appetize which I absolutely recommend.  Its basically braised barbecue beef, queso cheese, on top of fried plantains.  Unreal.  I could've ate that as my meal.  As for main course, I had the skirt steak (some spanish A word on the menu), which was cooked perfectly.  Tender, flavorful, not fatty, the whole 9 yards.  It came on a bed of red beans and rice which were nothing crazy, but fit perfectly with the steak and were absolutely enjoyable.  My girlfriend got the Churrasco, which is a filet style steak, with Sweet potato puree.  I don't know a ton of details but she loved it. Finally, i noticed before I went their facebook page offered $15 off your bill just for it being Thursday.  Waiter added it without issue.  Overall, the 5 star rating was more for the fact that they didn't mess up anywhere, and the food was delicious, as opposed for the decor being mindblowing.   I recommend to anyone.",0.9954,0.807,0.179,0.014,0.4911172161172162

2012-07-02,5.0,"Jim has been talking about this place for quite a while, so when his birthday dinner loomed, we weren't surprised when he chose Carnivale for the festivities. We were seated relatively quickly, and the staff was very attentive.  Drinks arrived fast as did our appetizers -- guacamole (Excellent, chunky and tasty) and Flores y Camarones (SO delicious we all agreed that they could just keep them and the drinks coming and we'd be happy.) both of which we split three ways. After overdoing it the previous week at Maya del Sol, I was determined to take it easier on the cocktails so I only had one, but it was a coconut mojito, and if you think that sounds good you should try it.  In fact, try drinking only one! It was heavenly.  Just a perfect cocktail.  Jim's margarita was delicious, too, but it could not steal my heart away from my mojito. The birthday boy had the costilla des res.  Again, not a surprise because he is a serious fan of the short rib.  I love them, too, but I saw gnocci with ramps, mushrooms and peas and simply could not resist.  I snarfed them down in spite of preferring my dumplings to be heavier.  These were like clouds and I still loved them because the sauce was so exceptional.  Glinda had the Peruvian-style chicken and I was blown away by how moist and tender it was.   Desserts were the farmers' market special which was a mixed berry cobbler, chocolate cake with almond ice cream and the banana cream pie.  With candied macadamia nuts.  They took out one of my crowns.  Actually I found it kind of funny; it was an old crown and s**t happens.  No big.  I told the waitress that but she kept apologizing.  Then the hostess came by and apologized and comped the pie, which I thought was pretty nice of them.  But then I'm kind of easy-going about stuff.   (Which is one reason why, when I give a one-star review,  pay attention to it.  I am HARD to piss off.) I have to admit that along with excellent food and service the people-watching is fantastic at Carnivale.  A couple got engaged while we were there, and the outfits that flowed past the table ranged from ""That looks nice and cool"" to ""Oh dear, mutton dressed as lamb."" to ""What is that guy wearing?"" to ""What DO you think you LOOK like?""  But in the end, the place has such a laid back vibe that almost everything worked.  It was fun.  It was what its name implied, a kind of carnivale atmosphere year-round.  Well done to the owners; they've created a winner.",0.9981,0.735,0.211,0.054,0.6754258614014711
2012-07-01,4.0,"Carnivale's always been one of those restaurants that I wanted to try, but never did. I nearly booked a Christmas party or banquet here, but didn't because the space was too big for our needs. Lucky for me, I attended a wedding here last month where I finally got to experience this awesome restaurant and venue. The wedding ceremony took place in a large room upstairs. The room was perfect for this amazing couple whose personalities match the bright and sassy decor of the restaurant. After the ceremony, we hung out in the lobby while servers came around with mojitos, margaritas, and one other drink. Of course, being pregnant, I couldn't enjoy any of those yummy cocktails. One of the servers made a point of getting me a non alcoholic margarita aka lemonade. No complaints here since I drink lemonade by the truckload these days. I'm glad that they made sure I was comfortable and taken care of at the wedding. Servers also walked around with tasty appetizers like beef short rib, ceviche, and others.  Once the ceremony room was flipped for the reception, we were seated among a fun mix of the bride and groom's friends. We were served a delicious, peppery arugula salad to start. It's a refreshing way to get a meal started. For my entree, I chose chicken. Though the description didn't sound as good as the steak my husband picked, I was wrong. It was seriously the best chicken I've ever had at a wedding. It was so tender and moist, completely perfect. It had a touch of spiciness too. Talk about truly tasty chicken. There wasn't any rubbery wedding chicken here. I practically had to save some of the chicken for my husband to try because I wanted to eat all of it. Being pregnant, I can only consume so much at once, so my squashed stomach couldn't handle all of the chicken. My husband lucked out and finished my plate after finishing his. Even he was jealous of my entree pick for the dinner.  We danced to their live band, hung out, and enjoyed their wonderful wedding cake for the rest of the night or as much as I could handle. Our friends' wedding at Carnivale is in our top ten of weddings we've attended.

Grrr. I tried to order a couple different drinks but was told they did not have one and didn't know how to make the other.

It took so long for someone to come over I got bored and thought, what the hell, and tried another sip ( i know, I know) this time I didnt get a big chunk of glass, only little pieces gritting in my teeth (I deserved that one!) the waitress seemed to care less and I had to remind her of my new drink after several minutes of just waiting. The manager did come over and do her best to be apologetic. Though it made me feel a bit worried when she took my number in case I had any complications ""passing"" the glass I had just ingested!  Oh well, things happen. We had the cheese course to start which was nice. I ordered the rib eye steak for the entree. First my sister in laws plate was put down and looked great. Ditto for my brother. Then they put down my rib eye and I thought I was being punked. Think steak from a high school cafeteria or next to some eggs at Denny's. I tried a tiny bit of my thin, overcooked, grissly steak only to spend the next few minutes trying to get the crap outta my teeth. I NEVER send food back but not this time.

The Ropa Vieja had a nice kick to it and was very different from any type of braised beef I've had before.  For dessert, we had the birthday flan, banana cream pie, and the carnivale ice cream cake. The flan was okay (quite different from the Filipino style I'm used to), but the banana cream pie and carnivale ice creams are must haves. Our server Jonathan was really good.

2012-04-30,4.0,"I don't know what took me so long to come to Carnivale, but I can't wait to go back!  My party of 10 first had drinks at the main lobby bar. The staff is QUICK! It's like they are mind readers too, they know that you're going to have another delicious drink and they are right there to make sure you get it quickly. My drink of choice for the night was red Sangria...it's delish and does the trick!  After departing the bar, we head to our table. I love the dining room. It's large. It's colorful. It's like Punky Brewster came and decorated the room. I love it.  So we have Andrea (I'm pretty sure that's her name) as our server. She's sweet, she's very helpful, and she's loud...you've gotta be loud here because it's a loud restaurant.  We started with a couple of meat & cheese platters. I could have ate that cheese for days, but a girls gotta keep room for the next course. If you love blue cheese, I recommend that one for sure.  The next course was appetizers. GET THE GUACAMOLE. The Ropa Vieja was also very good, but...GET THE GUACAMOLE if you're only having one appetizer.  Next on the menu (as suggested by Andrea) was my main dish of Churrasco (which is, Nicaraguan style wood grilled beef tenderloin, boniato puree, truffle oil, choclo corn, herb chimichurri). This meat is so tender and so delicious, it'll knock your socks off. I'm not kidding here guys, it really was out of this world. I tried a couple of the other dishes (Salmon, Chuleta, and Arrachera) but I think the Churrasco was by far the best.  Unfortunately I had to scoot out before dessert. I love dessert. I was so pissed. I was even more pissed the next day when I heard about how good the dessert was.  What have we learned here today kids? GET THE GUACAMOLE!  Seriously though, come here!

2012-04-20,4.0,"To be fair, I'm going to write this review in two parts. Part uno: Margaritas 101 - the inspiration to go to Carnivale in the first place. Part dos: Dinner - what we had after the class. Part Uno - 3/5 stars A friend sent me the invitation to Carnivale's ""Margaritas 101,"" a ""hands-on class featuring two mouthwatering margarita recipes from Carnivale's cocktail menu"" (as the invitation stated exactly). The invitation also went on to say that we would be sampling appetizers along with the margaritas. Great, right? I was thinking wow, what a great deal; a two hour class with food and drinks for only $25! Now, the mixologist, Daryl Freeman, was a great host. He had a good presence in the room and presented the information about margaritas very clearly, and dang does he know how to make a good margarita! I liked both the Blood Orange Margarita and the traditional one, and they went really well with the guacamole that was sitting at the table. But the ""appetizers?"" One bite-sized arepa and one bite-sized ropa vieja. Seriously? Don't get me wrong - the flavor was delicious and of course I wanted more, but that was the problem - there wasn't more. It was 7:30, an hour in to the supposedly two hour long class, and we were done with both the food and drink! Maybe I'm overreacting, but that just did not live up to my expectations at all. It did accomplish probably what they were hoping it would accomplish...we quick made a reservation via opentable and ran downstairs to fill up our bellies, which leads me to.... Part dos: 4/5 stars They actually sat us earlier than our reservation, which seems to not be the norm based on several of the other reviews. As soon as we entered the main dining room, I was really in awe. I'm not typically one to take pictures at restaurants, but the decor was just fabulous. I was mesmerized by the changing backlights of the wine displays all night. Our server, Michael, was nice but clearly stretched thin with all of his responsibilities. He warned us that the kitchen was behind, but our Mixto Ceviche came out in a completely reasonable timeframe (although it did take an additional 10 minutes after we finished it for me to get my flight of wine). I was a huge fan of the ceviche, but the man friend wasn't, as he said it was too tangy (so I guess that means he doesn't like ceviche at all, since tang/citrus is kind of critical). Our dinners were phenomenal: the Churrasco and the Chupe de Mariscos. I loved the marinade with my seafood, and the scallops were particularly mouthwatering. The man friend enjoyed his steak, which was cooked to perfection and had no fat, so he cleaned his plate.  More generally speaking, it was a Wednesday night and it was packed, so I could see why one wouldn't want to come without a reservation. I do think, however, that the ambiance and atmosphere exceeded my expectations and made up for my less-than-stellar experience in the class.

HOWEVER, in recent months I've started the steps to reverse this life situation by doing unconventional things like, paying my credit card bills, paying my student loans, and not spending every dime I get.  So, how did little old me, afford the opportunity to dine at Carnivale? Well, I'll leave out the specifics but we'll just say I've got amazing friends who've got great contacts and somehow this all worked out and I was able to dine at a place that virtually all of my others friends have already dined at, but without their broke ass Candi G friend.  Sooo, how was it?  It was colorful. It was flavorful. It was phenomenal.  The Drinks:  -Red Sangria: down the hatch faster than 1, 2, 3.  -Frozen White Sangria with raspberries and blueberries: I ordered this by pointing to someone else's drink and saying 'gimme the white one with all the crap in it'... and the server was playfully responsive to willy nilly beverage request.  The Food:  Chips & guac: Holy guacamole! So lime-y, so salty, so smoov.  Some kinda charcuterie plate: ... i dunno, I don't eat meat... but I did eat the sh*t out of those marinated olives. Daaamn, demz good nuts.  Vegetariana: Veggies, cous cous, some spicy sauce. Pretty simple, but also unexpectedly delicious. And I don't mean that like I didn't think it'd be delish- just that I didn't think it'd be THAT delish.  The Dessert: Ice Cream Cake: Yao Ming sized ice cream cake with three layers, one of which you think is vanilla-- but it ain't. What it be? MANGO.  Sundae: Served in a margarita glass the size of my head. Do I need to elaborate? Don't be a fool- just order it.  MuFuggin Cotton Candy: Enough cotton candy for the entire state of Delaware... which I did not do my due diligence on looking up to verify, but I've heard the state's quite small, and due to their large number of orthodontists, they aren't in the market for much cotton candy, so I can only assume that just the one serving is more than enough for the entire state.

The coconut mojito was good but I ordered three pork tacos and they were served on a long oval plate. They took about 2/3 of the plate and looked careless. The presentation was mediocre. The actual pork is supposedly slow cooked but it tasted really greasy. Also, the chips served were drenched in oil. Even Chipotle's chips aren't as oily. I asked the waitress if she would recommend the Chicken Milanesa sandwich or the Pork Tacos. She said the Pork Tacos but couldn't tell me why. She said she had just started there though she sounded like she'd been there for 10 years because she sounded so defeated: at lunch! With one table.  I like the decor, space and music.

2012-03-24,4.0,"Chicago's West Loop is really a mecca of quality restaurants. Tonight my wife and I made a pilgrimage to Carnivale  where we met up with another couple for dinner. This was my first visit to Carnivale and I was immediately impressed with how busy they were for 5:45pm. We arrived a bit early for our 6:00pm reservation, but were promptly seated and the vast dining room was remarkably already half full (and was nearly at capacity by mid way through our dinner). As you might expect from it's name, Carnivale has an energetic, fun ambiance and seems like a great place to come with a group of friends for a celebration.  The decor is quite colorful and loud without being tacky. There was a diverse group of patrons; some customers were adorned in t-shirts or sweatshirts whereas others were decked out in suits and several others were sporting club attire. Wide range of ages here as well; I probably saw people ranging from 1 month to 100 years tonight. The menu at Carnivale features South American fusion with a hint of Asian influence. The menu is neatly divided into different categories with enough choices to appeal to the wide range of people Carnivale attracts, but not so many choices as to be overwhelming. The first page is devoted to Artisanal Meats & Cheeses; page two has the appetizers and ceviches, page three has the entrees and page four has the house cocktails. There is a separate wine list (featuring South American wines) and a sheet listing the cocktails of the month.  Our party of four shared a tasting of three cheeses (all were good, but Pleasant Ridge Reserve was the standout). The cheese plate came with some rather tasty housemade crackers, a handful of roasted nuts and honey. We also shared a tasting of three ceviches (we opted for the one that was octopus based, one halibut based and a yellowtail cut like sashimi with black garlic). While this was not the best ceviche I have had (this honor would go to Topolobampo, Mixteco Grill and Los Nopales), it was good and there was no leftovers. For my entree had the Arrachera (grilled Angus skirt steak with caramelized onions, beans, rice and chimichurri sauce). The steak had a nice flavor, but compared to the amazing skirt steak I had enjoyed at Sepia earlier this week it definitely was not the highest quality cut of beef (it was a tad too tough and chewy). I am a huge fried plantain fan, so I ordered a side of these and they did not disappoint. Portion sizes were surprisingly large and I barely managed to finish my entree.  Carnivale features some fun drinks as well. It was a tad too chilly tonight to experiment with their frozen concoctions, but I started with a glass of red sangria (which was pretty good), had a wine flight with my entree (you get to pick your own flight; there are about eight choices of red and of white and you select three). For dessert I had some spiked hot cider that was a nice end to the meal. The dessert drinks are a real bargain at $5. Our service was decent; our primary waiter was attentive and reasonably friendly and his assistant always kept our water glasses full and the table clean. While the meal was not cheap, it was fair considering portion size and quality. With tax and tip dinner came to about $65 per/person and included the cheese flight, ceviche tasting, four entrees, eight drinks and one dessert. While this was not one of the best dinners I have had recently, all in all it was a good meal and a fun atmosphere and I am glad I came.",0.9989,0.773,0.196,0.031,0.5194139194139193

Diners with heavier palates will prefer the pork. Desserts didn't not shine as the entrees.

2012-02-22,5.0,"Dined at Carnivale last night for the first time. We went there for the last day of Carnivale/Fat Tuesday celebration. We had a reservation for 7:00. We got there early (about 6:45) and had to wait about 10 minutes - not bad at all.  We were seated in the main dining area at a four person table (we were only two). The dining room is bright and colorful and just sitting there raised my mood. We opted to do the a la cart menu (not the restaurant week menu, which did not have very appetizing main course selections). I started with a hurricane to drink (to celebrate fat Tuesday). Fairly strong and tasty, but it was only a special for the holiday.  For the appetizers, we ordered the small Guacamole and it was very good. No spice to it and nothing really special about it, but the chips served with it were very good. We also ordered the Ropa Vieja and that was VERY good. The blend of spicy and sweet was perfect. Before our main entrees came out, I ordered another drink. This time I opted for the coconut mojito, which was one of their specialties. It was very good and quite refreshing.  It was very difficult to pick an entrée; there were so many great selections. I opted for the Churrasco, which was delicious. Honestly, I didn't even know what I was eating. The meat was cooked perfectly and very flavorful. It came on a bed of something mashed, which had a bit of sweetness to it. The combination was very good. My husband opted for the Bife Angosto. I think we thought that my meat was more flavorful, but his side of Yukon gold and purple potatoes was very good.  They did have some entertainment for the holday: a few dancers, a band, a stilt walker, and others. I enjoyed the lively atmosphere.  We had no trouble with the service, which seems to be a common complaint of yelp reviewers. We were seated quickly, our food came out in the perfect amount of time, and our waiter was attentive. Though the bar and waiting area seemed incredibly crowded, they do a great job of spacing the tables in the main dining room, so you never feel smashed together. It is not a cheap place (our bill was $140 w/tip), but it was well worth it!",0.9984,0.736,0.23,0.034,0.6115178571428571

The guacamole is delicious and fresh, but it shouldn't be any less, right? The flores y camarones are just whatever.  For dinner, we have tried Costilla de Res, which is a short rib. It is a VERY SWEET dish. I didn't really enjoy it fully, but I like to have a variety of flavors on my plate :) The meat was very tender though! The Arrachera is DELICIOUS! It's so simple (just skirt steak, rice, and onions) but it tastes so good. Tender meat & amazing rice. The Pollo was good as well (not excellent), but I really don't enjoy their pickled veggies. Definitely not a fan of those.  The best part is the dessert. We had this chocolate cake w/ 3 different ice cream flavors with hot fudge poured over it.

We were seated upstairs (sadly not by the balcony), and we greeted by two waiters who were fine. It felt like they did their jobs because they had to and were getting paid, and not because they enjoyed it. We immediately ordered drinks (getting drinks at the bar took forever), which were average (despite its drink reputation). We tried the coconut mojito (the winner), juniper blossom, blood orange margarita, and a mojito with cava. For food, we all did the restaurant week menu and were quite disappointed. The arugula salad was overdressed with a sparing amount of the promised goat cheese (that being said, the candied pepitas were tasty), the vegetable paella was bland (where was the saffron?), overdone (no crispiness anywhere), and had a small amount of vegetables. It was more like a bad fried rice. Then, the worst dish of the night - the cookie sandwich. When the dishes were brought to our table, the ice cream was already melted, the cookies were hard and stale, and just generally the flavors did not work.

They will make you wait regardless if you have a reservation or not so that you can sit at their bar for about 15-20 minutes. I have had many of their frozen cocktails and all are worth the time and are delicious. The fresh guacamole is devine and my favorite part of the meal. The chips are crisp and homemade and they use locally grown veggies. Opt for the large sized guac. Fish taco apps are really wonderful as well. I do not eat meat but my friends meals looked fantastic. It is a high energy place that is wide open space, but they have seating areas that are off to the side of the main dining room that provide more of a private space.

If you are not a foody, or native Latin, you are most likely unfamiliar with much of the fare as its described on the menu.  Take advantage of the Tastings.  These are well presented and worth the effort.  Two of special note!  The Tequila tasting - do not assume all tequila is the same.  Find your own then stick with it.  If you are lucky like me, your guest will discover theirs after the first try and the rest will be all yours! (El higado no existe!)  Second tasting to not be missed is the cured meats.  Yup that's right.  If you have not been to Spain and experienced one of the best taste sensations on earth, you have no idea, NO IDEA, what you are missing.  So, when a place like Carnivale goes to the considerable trouble of putting a collection like this together for us; Don't miss it! I've hosted group events all of over the world, and doing so at Carnivale has been my favorite.  From the private, but not so private rooms that make you still a part of the bustle of the main dining room, to the perfectly dull roar of the crowd mixed with the right music, to the great group menu options, the team here does it all right. Final comments:  the Bar.  If you are off hours and only a few of you are bellied up to the counter, it can feel a bit cold.  But when the room is full, or even better if you have a large party of your own, this is one of the best bars to be at in town.  It's all about the dynamics, and this space has the perfect mix for a party...guess that's why it's called Carnivale!",0.9945,0.8,0.168,0.032,0.5419208698278467

2012-01-04,4.0,"Mad at myself for not finding this restaurant sooner. I was invited here by a friend, to celebrate her husbands birthday. It was a large party, and we would not be seated until everyone arrived. That was a little bit of a bummer, but we hung out in the huge bar/lounge area and ordered drinks and waited. Once we were escorted into the main dining room and the curtains opened, it was beautiful in the restaurant, so many colors and a huge wine wall. Our party was a total of 12 and we only were given 1 waiter. I figured on a Friday night with that many people we would have more than one waiter. It started off really rocky, the waiter let some people order starters, then when I wanted an appetizer I was told I couldn't order it because she needed more help with our table. It was the strangest thing. I can't be mad at the restaurant for the waiter for making no sense. After a long 45 minutes wait, we had 2 waiters at our table and taking our orders. I ordered a Mojito Smoothie to start and it was really good. For an appetizer I had the Mac n Cheese which is actually a side dish, but It looked better to me than most of their appetizers. I'm glad I ordered it, it was fantastic and I would go back just for that. For my main course I had the Arrachera, Skirt Steak, rice and beans in a chimichurri sauce. The dish was full of flavor. I think our waiter was just having a bad day and I don't want to base my review on just the service alone, because the food definitely made up for it. My friends and I noticed that a group of girls behind us, got delivered a huge ball of Cotton Candy in a Vase filled with Carmel Corn. We did not see this on the dessert menu and asked, how do we get one of those? Sure enough they make Cotton Candy, it's just not on the menu. For $9 to split between a table of 12 wasn't a bad price at all. It was a fun night out and I can't wait to go back with a smaller group, hoping the service will be better.",0.9949,0.78,0.172,0.048,0.6004594820384294

I think he enjoyed it, though it may have been a little salty. I almost forgot, we got an order of guacamole (one avocado, that is plenty for two people) and it was so tasty.

When we walked up to the hostess stand, we asked for a table for three in the bar area -- since the bar itself was two deep, we thought the best option was a table in that area. So we were seated, and the waiter came by with menus. He was really friendly, at first -- asking how our day was, joking about the fact that hopefully it would get better with our experience there. When he returned, we gave our drink order. He then asked if we wanted any apps, and my friends and I decided we'd just stick with drinks. He gave a brusque ""okay"" then walked away quickly. Odd, but mmmkay. Five minutes later he came back and said ""Are you sure you don't want an appetizer or meal? Because you're really not allowed to sit here unless you purchase food.""  Um. wha?  Stunned, my friends and I sat there for a minute, completely mute. Then I asked for clarification -- we really weren't allowed to be there unless we ordered food? When we could probably spend MORE money than the price of a single appetizer by having two or three drinks each?  Apparently, yes, that's exactly what he meant. Angry, and quite frankly, a bit embarrassed that we were essentially being told we weren't welcome there, I said to the waiter we wanted our bill and that we planned to leave.

2011-12-27,4.0,"I don't always opt for over-the-top, flashy dining experiences, but when I do, I prefer Carnivale. The soccer pitch-sized dining area is epic in scale and whimsical in its decor. The space is lit by Liberty Bell-sized paper lanterns, and the walls are decorated with a dazzling array of colors. It's definitely in-your-face, which usually puts me off, but for some reason most of it works at Carnivale (with the exception of the ridiculous short ties that the waiters are wearing. Maybe the proprietor wants to create the illusion that the servers are wearing vests without actually paying for them? I'm at a loss on this one).  The drinks at Carnivale are consistently awesome. The caipirinhas are made with real cachaca and are not too sweet, so I usually opt for these; however, the specialty beverages are also top notch (tonight, I enjoyed a tequila ""old fashioned"" made with Maestro Dobel tequila). The food is typically outstanding. Piquant, chunky, and thoroughly garlicky guacamole is absurdly delicious, and is served with crack-addictive tortilla chips. Ceviches have been consistently well-prepared, and the cheese plate we enjoyed this evening had some truly distinctive options (a brie-like soft cheese from southern Indiana wrapped in bourbon-soaked cornhusks, as well as rosemary-crusted manchego, were very interesting). The entree list is dominated by red meat options, all of which have been spectacular in my experience. I've personally enjoyed the arranchada (skirt steak with rice and beans and chimichurri), filet medallions, and costilla de res (beef short ribs served with deliciously cheesy polenta). The pork chop is seasoned perfectly, fills the plate, and is actually cooked to order rather than charred beyond recognition (as is par for the course at most restaurants). Desserts (notably the Carnivale ice cream cake that comes with passion fruit ice cream, guava/cream cheese ice cream, and pistachio/chocolate chip ice cream) are uniformly decadent and way too large for mere mortals to consume on their own. I would have given Carnivale 5 stars based on my other experiences before dining there tonight, but one of our dishes bombed; the sweet potato soup with crab salad was cloyingly sweet, and thick like baby food. Very unpleasant. Still, this is the only bad bite I've experienced on several visits, so it only nominally detracts from my perception of the restaurant - I'll forget about it. Service is very attentive. Pricing is definitely high (apps ~$10, mains ~$25, drinks ~$10), but by no means exorbitant for food of this caliber served in this setting.

Sensual music playing, big lipped stars' photos on the wall...open space, high ceilings--it seems like this was an old factory done up to a beautiful restaurant. Ceilings are hung with colorful giant lanterns and walls are adorned with colorful paintings.  After doing much Yelp research, I decided to go with the highly raved about ropa vieja, which was completely worth it. This was one of my favorite dishes eaten in Chicago. We also had the laughing shrimp on a corn tortilla with chihuahua cheese, which was also a favorite. It was such perfection. Had I stopped at these two plates and had another similarly two good starters, this would have been a perfect meal. However, the wagyu sandwich tasted good (but nothing special) and salad with olives and ricotta was pretty off-putting for me. Come for dinner, as there is an expanded menu (lunch only carries mostly sandwiches), live music, more people around (the restaurant really is spacious)...I'm sure the hustle and bustle really makes this place great.

I was visiting a friend in Chicago and we chose Carnivale for Saturday night because I read about it on Epicurious and here on Yelp. Great choice.  True to the other reviews, we did have to wait 15 minutes for our table. We thought arriving early would help but it didn't because we waited 15 minutes after our reservation time. We were lucky enough to snag seats at the bar so we were fine waiting. We each ordered a drink- my friend loved her margarita and my drink was just ok. For dinner, we decided to go with all small plates.  We started with the ceviche trio of shrimp, salmon and hirimasa. All three were good, but the shrimp was our favorite. The sauce was so flavorful and delicious.  Next up was the pork appetizer which was beyond yummy. We about licked the plate. A cheese tortilla item was next. It was supposed to have squash blossoms on it (our reason for ordering it), but it had edible orchid instead. Kinda weird and disappointing. However it was so good that we didn't care. Lastly we ordered the ropa. Again super tasty...a little sweetness added to the meaty flavor.  Everything was so good!  And the atmosphere is fun, colorful and trendy.  It is a very big space which is not for everyone, but if you are ok with it, I'd highly recommend this spot.",0.997,0.708,0.262,0.03,0.5659895833333332

As soon as I walked in, everything was BEAUTIFUL. Im a huge fan of all of the framed photography on the walls. Basically the ambiance and decor was great. Next, we had 9pm reservations and didnt get seated until about 9:20, which wouldnt have been a problem on any other night except that we rented a limo and things were running on a schedule. Anyways, so we sit at the bar to have a drink while we waited. The bartender was an older latino man, who seemed frustrated by us from the moment we sat down. We were trying to figure out who wanted what, being as for most of us, it was our first time there... and he was just being rude. I think he overheard my girlfriend and I asking what his problem was cuz he was being mean, and after that he started being nice and going over the menu with me. Fine... I did like that they had a photobooth downstairs by the washroom and a little vending machine for ballet slippers for us women to change out of our crazy heels... even though we did neither, I thought it was a nice gesture. FOOD: We had the Guacamole & Ropa Vieja for appetizers... DEEELISH!!!!!!!!!! Cant really mess those up. Nothing else on the menu really seemed appealing to me. I always order Arrachera everywhere else so I tried something different and ordered the Pollo & I felt like they were trying too hard to fancy up basic latin dishes by americanizing them and idk... my Pollo was just alright. Nothing fantastic. Finally, we get the bill and our server was LITERALLY standing behind us for a good 15-20 min while we're gathering credit cards and money together. I dont know if he expected us to eat and run, but I found it very rude. I myself serve part time at another downtown restaurant, and I know it doesnt give the best impression when you linger around for the check. So overall, my visit was just so-so... the food was kinda bland, the service could've been better from every worker I encountered. But the place was amazing.

The waiter warned it would be tart without syrup because then it's just lime juice and liquor, but I took my chances and it was fine, very smooth. The waiter told us the restaurant uses every effort to source local and organic, the pork included. So I ordered the Chuleta, medium rare. The first one they brought out was overcooked, so they gave me a small bowl of soup for the trouble and came out a few minutes later with a pink-centered chop. It was very moist and flavorful, in that fresh Latin American way. It came with a side of ""bacon-plantain fufu,"" which is a plantain mash with bacons sprinkled in.

They never got annoyed with teeny requests (e.g., make this dish less spicy for the people who don't love spice) - They offered us a full tasting of all the dishes, plus all of the drinks they'd be serving so we could choose what to serve for drinks, hors d'ouevres and the main dinner. No request was too small and no detail was left unchecked.  - The food, wine, drinks, everything we had was absolutely delicious.

The use of the space hit me in the face as soon as we walked into the main dining room, in an awesome way. I love the crazy-tall ceilings, the colours everywhere, the huge light fixtures. I ate with my mom on a Sunday evening at 6. The room was less than half-full when we sat down, but by the time we left around 7.15, it had filled in pretty well. We both had red sangria, which I thought was excellent, then kicked off our meal with a selection of 3 ceviches--the shrimp, the mixto (featuring octopus), and the salmon. I liked the mixto best, but I think I would skip the ceviches on my next trip. They weren't awful, but they kind of all had the same flavour and reddish sauce, despite having different interesting ingredients on the menu, and I couldn't identify all the chewy bits in the salmon one. The ceviches made me nervous for our entrées, but I stopped worrying at first bite. I had the Vegeteriana and my mom had the Pollo. My dish had a butternut squash base, with a medley of vegetables including zucchini, mushrooms, and other delights. The flavour was fantastic, especially the squash. My mom's Pollo was also excellent--a bit simpler, perhaps--but the chicken was super marinated and delicious. I did think that the Vegetariana is a bit on the small side, especially when compared to the Pollo.

Very knowledgeable and attentive. The assisting staff were also very attentive. We ordered a raspberry and a coconut mojito for our cocktails and they were very good. We had the Ropa Vieja for a appetizer and it was outstanding. Very flavorful with a little bit of heat. Enough for 3 people. My wife had the Peruvian style chicken which was large enough for two people. The chicken and side veggies were very good. I had a corn chowder that was a special for the night and it was the best corn chowder I have ever had. Sweet corn and a very creamy stock with jsu a hint of chile heat. I ordered the grilled skirt steak as my entree and it was out of this world. It came with rice and beans and sweet red onions, topped with a chimichurri sauce. This whole dish was great but the onions made it outstanding. Did not have room for dessert.  Cannot wait to go back.",0.9751,0.856,0.144,0.0,0.5731149097815764

When we were done with our meal, my friend decided she wanted dessert.  15 minutes later, when the waiter still hadn't come back, we asked the busser if he would just bring our check.  He did, and my card sat on the table for another 15 minutes before anyone came to take it.  Outraged, I brought the check to the hostess station and asked her to run our bill.  She brought it to the server and he ran it right away. I'm willing to say that any restaurant can have an off night but my friend and I felt absolutely ignored by our server.  In hindsight, I should have complained to a manager but we were simply too upset.  It's sad to see that at one of my favorite restaurants in the city, I'm treated like my service just doesn't matter.",-0.7615,0.811,0.087,0.102,0.5384199134199135

2011-08-04,2.0,"I came here with a large group of people for a dinner. We were seated by the back bar (this place is HUGE). We had to wait a little for our table for what seemed like no reason (no one else was waiting, it was 6:30pm) which was kind of off-putting, but our waitress was speedily right at our table after we were seated. The drink reviews in our group were mostly rave. Most of us got mojitos (the coconut mojito was the clear winner) and I got a Alegria (I'm a sucker for anything ginger flavored) and it was quite delicious. My bf got one of the drink specials (farmer's market punch) and it was pretty bland. But he seemed to be picking only the dud drinks, as his second drink (the Paloma) was also bad, it just tasted like straight-up alcohol. We started out with a large guacamole for the table. Here is where I kinda started to not like the service. We asked our waitress if we should order a large or a small and she told us that a large is only enough for four people (we had 7). We decided to just go ahead and order one large for all of us. So yeah. It came, and it was HUGE. Like, way more than enough for all of us. Stop trying to make more money (a large guac is $15). I will say the guacamole was really tasty. But if we had two orders, none of us would've been able to eat any entrees. Instead of ordering a full entree, I decided to go with an appetizer and a 3-ceviche tasting, since the ceviches looked so good. I'll agree with other reviewers that the ceviches weren't really ceviches, they're more like sashimi appetizer, but they were pretty awesome. And honestly, yes, they're kind of expensive, but it's quality fish, and if it was billed as sashimi people would probably pay the price without any complaints. The appetizer I got was the Ropa Vieja, which I thought was awesome and the size was huge. My bf got the Bife Angosto, which was alright. I loved the steak itself, but I think the credit for that goes more towards the organic grass-fed quality, although the steak was cooked pretty well. The side of a potato, chorizo, and cheese casserole was meh, I mean anything with chorizo and cheese tastes good but it wasn't anything special. I had little tastes of the pork adobo, which was good but tasted a little dry, the salmon special which was good and very well-cooked, and the arepa appetizer, which was very tasty. In all, it was a decent meal, but it was very expensive for what it was and nothing all that special. I will say what seems to be my standard complaint with high-end Latin/Mexican restaurants in Chicago - if you're going to spend this kind of money, you might as well go to Frontera or Topolobamplo.",0.998,0.755,0.191,0.054,0.6003052995391702

The coconut mojito is delicious, so definitely try that if you're into that. We started with a large order of guacomole, which was about enough to sustain our table. Our entrees arrived in a timely fashion, as well, ranging from ceviches, fish, other seafood, and steaks. My order of sockeye salmon was perfectly cooked and seasoned, I only wish it was in a bigger portion. The chimichurri on my friend's steak was pretty fantastic, as well.

2011-07-17,5.0,"My most FAVORITE restaurant in Chicago. Yelpers, that is a big declaration. In a website in which I review food, to declare one as my MOST favorite is a big deal. Take a seat, sit back, and read the top five reasons why you should go here. 1. The food is awesome. I always try to order something new whenever I revisit a restaurant, but this is one of those places where the thing you had the first time is way too good to try something else. That being said, I've had my fair share of eating off other's plates and hence, I feel as if I can honestly say everything I've tried here is AWESOME. My favorite item is the Pollo: ""Peruvian style chicken, potatoes, green beans, olives,queso fresco, aji amarillo sauce"" (straight from the online Carnvale menu) The chicken is juicy, full of flavor, and the accompanying sides are paired perfectly. The fiance usually gets some sort of beef and it's always tender and full of yummy flavor.  2. The atmosphere is ALWAYS fun. The decorations are great, bright and full of color. Perfect for a fun dinner night with friends or for a romantic meal with the significant other.  3. The sangria is top notch. Sometimes I'll try a mojito or another cocktail but this the sangria is always a staple. Full of juicy fruit and alcohol, I wish I could always have a pitcher of this treat in my fridge.  4. They cater to really large parties. I recently went with a group of 14 girls. Not a problem whatsoever. This place is huge. A family friend just got back from a wedding reception there and the pictures are WONDERFUL. If I could afford to host my wedding reception there, I totally would. The colors painted a gorgeous backdrop and everyone raved about the food.  5. It's a different dining experience. I always feel like it's not just a dinner and I'm not just there to simply fill my stomach. I'm there to ENJOY myself and have great food, great drinks, and a really fun time. Whenever I have friends or family in town, I make it a point to take them here.",0.9993,0.676,0.316,0.008,0.5897672055835321

Mojitos = always too sweet for me, until I realized the beauty of asking for half-sweet (half the amount of simple syrup). Perfecto. If mojitos aren't your thing, try the Juniper Blossom. And this comes from a girl who hates gin.  Come later in the evening on a summer night and sit out in the bar area when they have the windows open overlooking the highway (sounds weird, I know, but it's awesome).

I tried asking the waiter before I ordered if they prepared the yucca any other way. I described how I was hoping to get it made, boiling it- like yucca con mojo. He kinda looked at me weird, acted like he knew what I was talking about. But he obviously did not. I was hoping for more of a Cuban influence. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here again.

From the margarita to the main course, Carnivale is a cannot miss place! We had an 8:30pm reservation, and because we were a bit early, we had to wait in the bar. Which was fine by me because it was fun! The decor and ambiance definitely mimicked what we were about to see in the dining room. I got the margarita on the rocks, which was done perfectly by the attentive and friendly bartender. At 8:30 we were promptly seated at one of the best seats of the house. We were up on the second level so we could see the entire room. Our waiter looked and talked like Steve Buschemi, which was awesome. He was also really knowledgable about the wines, and helped my date decide between two he was thinking of. We ultimately decided to do a cured meat, cheese, and ceviche starting with the Fr a'Mani Salumi, Rosemary Mancheg, and Hiramas. Because I love white, we went with the Westrey Pinot Gris. I am not a seafood fan and never had ceviche before, but I decided to try it. It wasn't served like it normally is, apparently. Instead, the fish was cut into small fillets. I went for it, and was surprisingly good. The meats and cheese were out of this world. And the wine is now one of my faves, I have to remind myself to go buy a bottle. For dinner, I had Chuleta and he had Bife Angost and a bottle of red I sadly did not get the name of because it is one of the few I have really enjoyed. The Chuleta was a revelation: the bacon fufu is one of the most interesting and delicious sides I have ever had. The pork was done beautifully and the broth was the perfect compliment. The beef was incredible: when all of the flavors were combined, the dish was even better. We ended up deciding to skip dessert there, but the service, ambiance, and definitely the food made this one of the best dining and culinary experiences in Chicago to date.

Our server, Michael was awesome!  He was so pleasant and really dead on about his thoughts about things..i wanted to try the sangria but they were out :(  that was a big bummer.he did say there was a frozen white sangria...but kinda hinted that it wasnt good..he brought over a tasting and holy crap..if you like the taste of pure alcohol, frozen..or maybe cleaning products..then its for you...however the lemon meier drink and the coconut mojito were outstanding!! The guac was really really really good. I had the Gnocchi...which was not bad...but it just felt weird to be at a brazillian restaurant and the only options being a pasta dish or a vegetable dish with a bunch of veggies thats about it...you'd think by now they would have at least something else...especially since many people have said that vegetarian options are scarce here... now dessert on the other hand was amazing..the coconut cake was absolutely amazing.... i think i'll be back here for some drinks/apps, or desserts...it really is a fun place..i will warn you though it is really pricey...though valet is only 5 bucks which is awesome...

Eating at Carnivale is the equivalent to falling down the rabbit hole and ending up at the Mad Hatter's tea party. I have been wanting to go to this place for 2 years, and finally my GF took me for my bday. Aside from her getting the girlfriend-of-the-year award with dinner, we got some pretty solid dishes. Food is a bit limited for vegetarians, but if you like cheese then you will be well accommodated. Margaritas are limey and clean tasting. The waiters are attentive and quite knowledgeable. Much of the food is made from local produce and they have several events you can partake in. Prices are slightly unmatched with the quality/quantity of food...but really, you're paying for the changing lights display 100 feet above you, not the assortment of goat cheeses.  I'd go again just to sit there and stare at the walls. Romantic, exciting, inspiring and completely worth a visit.",0.9812,0.796,0.174,0.03,0.47776836689880164
2011-06-19,4.0,"Carnivale has a very appealing, festive, and flamboyant atmosphere. The second floor walls are composed of wine shelves beaming with colorful lights that would alter at intervals. The huge lantern-like accessories hanging from the tall ceiling also added to the liveliness. With such energetic decor, it's almost impossible to enter the dining hall without an elevated appetite for good food.  It was a Sunday evening with a few friends. There was no wait but the dining hall was 80% filled. For the entrees, we ordered: ""Bistek Palomilla - Niman Ranch ribeye, grilled onions, fried yuca and garlic mojo"" - The meat was thick but tender and flavorful. ""Mama Mendez' Arroz Con Mariscos - Sofrito rice, shrimp, mussels, clams, squid, chorizo, peas, chicken, lobster broth"" - As my Asian friends would say, ""This is by far the most expensive fried rice I've ever had."" Don't take me wrong though. That is not an understatement of Carnivale's paella. In fact, it was very rich in ingredients, especially with the seafood. It was a sizable portion and my friend had to take the rest to go in a doggy bag. ""Pernil - Rum glazed pork shoulder, fried plantains, Puerto Rican rice and beans"" - The pork shoulders were enjoyable. The rum flavor blended well with the fried plantains As for the desserts, we ordered: ""Carnivale Ice Cream Cake"" - The ice cream is a piece of artwork and the diners at nearby tables were awestruck with our choice. There were three levels of ice cream and cake, and to top it off with tumbling caramel made it even more savoring. We were also give a steak knife to carve into the artwork because of its towering presence. It would've toppled if we tried to take a scoop of it with our spoons.    ""Tres Leches with blueberries and mint cream"" - I didn't quite enjoy the mint cream but the tres leches was very tasty (unless you're lactose-intolerant). It was a small piece of pastry shared by four people but it was enough for each to take a spoonful. It wasn't especially sweet but was very moist and rich. All in all, it was a very pleasant dining experience. The service was average but the atmosphere and food were excellent.

The ropa vieja was our fav & the ceviche was delish! I enjoyed my main course which was the Chuleta, but my bf's Churrasco was beyond words. It's a great piece of meat, perfectly cooked to order, and a very generous portion. Other dishes ordered: Salmon special, Flank Steak special, Halibut, & Arrachera. Everyone was happy and finished their plates.  The server was knowledgeable, helpful, & ever present when we needed anything. Drinks were good as well. I highly recommend the Caipirinha; similar to a margarita, but less sweet. (Great drink for those who tend to guzzle.)  The decor is vibrant but not ostentatious. The overall theme is very colorful but in warm tones with over-sized accessories. Our table was great and we were seated promptly with our 6 pm reservation. You don't get to officially check in until your entire party is there. You can make your reservation online through their website, and any adjustments to the reservation can be done through the same process.

My favorite appetizer was the Arepa-Berkshire pork, corn cheese cake, plantains, black beans, jicama, avocado, aji limo puree. (Yes I copied this from the online menu). The other apps we had were the Flores y Camarones Edible flowers, Mexican shrimp, corn tortilla, chihuahua cheese, tomatillo habanero sauce. I don't recall any flowers..and the salsa seemed more like a cilantro and hot pepper sauce. still good. Guacamole ""Kleiner Style"" Chunky avocados, cilantro, chiles, onion, garlic, lime, chips Yep just a good yummy old fashioned guacamole. I didn't like the ceviche selection, but that is just my tastes, so if like whats in the different ones go for it. Others at the table loved it. for dinner I had Costilla de Res- Braised short rib, Three Sisters Farm cheese polenta, carrot escabeche, spiced cashews. I could not get enough of the polenta! the short rib just fell apart. My niece had the Arrachera Grilled skirt steak, rice and beans, sweet red onion, chimichurri sauce. Yes I am reviewing this because I ate some of hers to. It was a good skity steak, but it was skirt steak none the less, I liked the marinade. Now my friends dinner... hers took the cake!

We started with a ceviche, but it was just five small pieces of fish with some tiny veggies and sauce on top... looked more like a sashimi app.  Don't expect any chips or anything like a traditional ""ceviche"" at all.  Oh, and those five tiny pieces of fish are $12.  It would have been nice to have something more to chew on for that.

One time I even ate at the bar, and the food came out literally 10 minutes after we ordered. On that occasion, the guacamole we had ordered as an appetizer came out after we'd finished our meal, so the bartender didn't charge us for it. My only complaints are that the hostesses can be somewhat rude and you can end up waiting a long time for a table even with a reservation (although show me a restaurant where this isn't the case), and the service in the lounge can be hit or miss. For whatever reason, they have a difficult time dividing the bill onto separate credit cards in the lounge.  What drove me to write this review after so many trips to Carnivale was the amazing service I had recently when I took a group of 11 women for a bachelorette party. The service in the lounge and in the dining room are like night and day. Our table was tucked away in one of the many side rooms off of the main dining room. There were other parties in that room, but it still made for a more intimate atmosphere. Our server was very accommodating and knowledgeable about the menu, and when he took the drink and food orders he brought a second server with him to speed up the process. He gave us one check at the end, and we all just paid cash for what we owed, but he did offer to split it up on credit cards evenly or however we wanted. Excellent place for a big group!  Food and drink reviews: A lot of my favorite items (prickly pear mojito, tuna ceviche) are not available since they've changed the menu, but here are some of my recommendations on the current menu.  -Mojitos - The Meyer's lemon mojito (made with agave nectar) is no replacement for the prickly pear version. Stick with original or raspberry. I prefer agave over simple syrup and was able to get a regular mojito made with agave.  - Other drinks - My dinner companions liked the sangria, the frozen white sangria, and the Juniper blossom  -Ropa vieja (beef and plantains) -like taking a bite of heaven! Perfect combination of sweet and spicy. I almost never eat beef, but I can never turn down this dish!  -Remolachas (beet salad) - really fresh and the dressing is amazing  - Costilla de Res (braised short rib) - amazingly tender and flavorful, falls off onto your fork  - Gnocchi - It was pretty good, but not outstanding the way most of their other dishes are. I would pass.  - Pork Adobo and Arrachera are also excellent choices",0.9971,0.814,0.15,0.036,0.5892234901850286

This place is huge! The hostess was very sweet, our server was attentive and nice, even though they were packed she would stop by our table to check on us throughout dinner. We started with the ceviche tasting, which was very fresh and delicious. My honey had Costilla de Res (braised short ribs) and I had the Churrasco (beef tenderloin). My beef was tender and a decent size piece, with a green garlic chimichuri sauce. As soon as our food was served, I looked at my plate and it looked as if it had been sitting for a bit before being served. The sauce didn't glisten, it looked almost like the plates had sat under a heat lamp or something. It was good, but I just found that a bit off-putting. I think we hyped ourselves up so much before going, reading reviews, then you get hit in the face with the exciting atmosphere.

What I didn't like, if you have a big group, they will try to push lots of appetizers on you.   But honestly, the food is delicious.  You have to be a real snob to say it isn't.  We had a group of 14 and every single person was pleased.  I had the gnocchi, and a raspberry mojito - both with great flavors.  I tried my boyfriend's frozen white sangria - delicious!  I also had the Victoria's Secret, the description sounds good but it lacks flavor.  I tried a friend's friend plantains which melted in my mouth.  The guacamole is a must-have, but I'd hesitate to order it based on the price, it's $8 for a small and $15 for a large.  Personally, I find that expensive for an appetizer for just a normal night out.   The portion sizes all appeared a bit small for the prices.  Generally with pasta dishes I take some home, but another friend also ordered the gnocchi and we both devoured all of it.  That's what you get for upscale dining though.  I'd suggest to anyone to check out their website before you go to avoid sticker shock.

2011-04-09,1.0,"Maybe it was an off night, maybe it was just our server, it was something!    We have been here before and I have been here before with my girlfriends and it seems like it was better before.  The place is beautiful and quite different than many restaurants in the city.  Multicolored walls, lanterns hung from the ceiling, the name Carnivale goes well with how they decorated the restaurant.  Anyhow, I will rate by Service, Food, Drinks and Ambiance. Service: 1 Star If you get a server named Jessica, who looks like a thick Mexican Pinup girl you should refuse to be serviced by her.  From the time the hostess gave us our table to getting a drink, an appetizer, main entree, etc, there were 20 minute or so intervals.  We arrived at 8 left at 11:00.  Everything seemed to take forever, I understand she was taking care of several large tables, but if she couldn't handle a two person table we should've been given a different hostess.  I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, but when I would see people who arrived later than us getting their drinks, appetizers or entrees before us I was getting quite annoyed. Food: We had the Churassco, she advised it was huge and it could be shared, it was not big at all, portions were small and minimal compared to other places. Steak was juicy, prepared medium to perfection.  If it was bigger I'd be more satisfied. The ceviche- Halibut, Mixto and another one that I can't remember the name was again small & bland.  If you want ceviche, this is not the place.  Go to Nacional 27 and try the Ceviche Nachos.   Drinks: Watered down,  the capirinhas were watered down with sprite, when it should only be made with cachaca, limes and muddled sugar. Ambiance Nice, the place is beautiful, different, lively, cute, charming, and what we loved that it wasn't a cookie cutter restaurant that didn't try to live up to other restaurants.",0.9947,0.806,0.17,0.024,0.5499416433239963

2011-04-03,3.0,"2.5 stars really. It's complicated... This evening at Carnivale started out great, but ended poorly. I wish I could have a witty deliverance for this event, but alas, it's just sort of sad...  Our table was ready on time (awesome and unusual for such a popular place) and once we all had our drinks from the bar, made our way back, and back, and back, and further back into the farthest, darkest corner in the place. I realize they need to fill every seat, but here's the thing:  our reservations were made 3 weeks in advance, we were celebrating two birthdays with 7 people, and it was our first time here, which was noted on the reso so it was just disappointing. We passed big table, after big table, after big table and yet still ended up in the bowels of Carnivale. There was a bar right behind us, which had it been in service, would've started the party on a great note, but instead, it remained dark and deserted and depressing. After walking through the giant, colorful, party-like atmosphere of the previous room, WHAT A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. Big Strike One.  The service started out great with a friendly server and information about specials and suggestions for apps, etc. From there it went downhill and uphill and downhill again. It was like they were rushing us out of there, but then not accommodating our compliance. Food was great! We had 5 ceviche, guacamole, and arepa. Apps arrived and we had plenty of time to enjoy them and they were cleared in a timely manner. Hubs ordered a couple of bottles of wines to have with dinner, but the wines came long before we were finished with our initial drinks, and we are by no means slouches when it comes to drinking in a timely manner. Wine rush - strike one and a half... No sooner had they cleared our apps that the entrees came out. Normally a bit of time (~5 mins) between the two courses is a nice digestion period, but we didn't get that. This was the food rush - strike two and a half.... Again, food was fantastic. During the main course, not once did the server or bussers come to check if we wanted water, more drinks, how the food was, refill our wine, or if there was anything else we wanted (all of which we did). HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT & skip to STRIKE FOUR!! Again, almost immediately after dinner was over, they brought my SS & myself a little cake & ice cream for our birthdays, but I swear we barely took a single breathe in between them clearing the main course plates & bringing the birthday special. This sounds ungrateful, but it was another example of feeling rushed & ignored at the same time.  While full and food satisfied, we waited and waited for the server to offer the rest of our group desserts. She brought menus, then disappeared for a very long time. She came back and just didn't do anything to encourage our enjoyment. Not that we want high pressure up-sells, but put some effort into it, can't ya? No description of desserts or after-dinner drinks or coffees... She asked if we wanted more water... NOW you ask us if we want more water??? We're done! I would like to mention that the server was sweet and polite, just not the personality one would expect at a resto like Carnivale!! The bill comes... after more waiting, and before she could run away from us again hubs gives her the CC... we couldn't wait to get out of there. Moral of the story:  there are better places to get latin food in Chicago without this kind of experience.

The hostess wouldn't even make eye contact with us--whenever I walked up to ask how much longer it would be, she saw me coming and would duck into the back. I get it--you're popular and you're busy. If you wanted us to wait that long, I might even have done it if they just didn't take reservations (a la Kuma's Corner). The bar was too packed to grab a seat, and we were too hungry to drink that much, so we just waited for a while.

My friend and I went during restaurant week, so we chose from a prix fixe menu.  We both started with the manchego cheese, apple, and walnut salad.  The salad had the right amount of dressing, but overall it was nothing special.  Next, I had the pork adobo, which was shredded pork over coconut rice.  Again I thought the dish was just ok.  The food came out warm but not hot, which is a turn off to me.  The rice was lukewarm, not very sticky, and actually tasted a little oily.  The shredded pork was also pretty oily and too salty for me.  Last I had the tres leches cake, which again I thought was just ok.  The coffee flavored whipped cream and candied almonds were delicious but the actual cake was so-so.  I usually eat up all of my dessert no matter how full I am, but I did not finish this dessert. Overall I am so glad I went to Carnivale because I think it is a gorgeous restaurant with a fun atmosphere, and despite the huge size of the restaurant the service was exceptional.  However, I did not think that the food was as good as other people have said, and this may have been due to the fact that it was restaurant week.",0.9973,0.762,0.208,0.031,0.5642328042328043

But the way they make em here, well, makes you want to break out of the box and imbibe!! Carnivale is very big and open. The main dining area seems to stretch on forever and then there are also little seating areas off to the sides and in a 2nd floor balcony area. But oddly enough, the noise level is not what you would expect. I've eaten in both the main dining area and in one of the offshoots to the side and neither time did we have a problem with dinner conversation or feeling like we had to shout to hear each other. That can sometimes be an issue in these big, open restaurants. The food here is pretty stellar. I ate here about 3-4 years ago and remember really enjoying it, so I was excited to go back a second time just recently. We had a group of 6 so we started off with the ceviche tasting (a portion of all five) and guacamole. The ceviche's were all really tasty with the escolar being the standout. My only complaint, is the portion sizes were a little small. With 6 people it meant we all basically only got a small bite of each. But holy moly guacamole! It was delicious. Super fresh and chunky with just a touch of jalapeno without being overpowering. Mmmm, I wish I had some of that right about now. For my entree I did the mixed seafood dish (clams, shrimp, mussels, squid) which was good, although a little lackluster. It just didn't stand out for me. I tried my friends seared ahi tuna and Oh My God, it was amazing. I was wishing I had gotten that. The other diners seemed happy with their dishes although I did not try anything else.  Last but definitely not least, the desserts. They were, quite frankly, lick your lips good. We had some sort of chocolate coffee flan and I wanted to dive in to it. That and the sweet, sweet churros with the dipping sauce made me a happy, happy camper.

I've eaten here about 10 times since it opened and I still think that they have the best raspberry mojitos in town. A bit pricey $8.75 and the glass isn't that big but it's definitely worth a try. Yum yum yuuuuuum! They're food is very delicious and I think the prices are pretty reasonable to name a few the ropa vieja $10 appetizers is so good. I just love the meat served over plaintains. It is soo tasty!  For dinner, I normally stick with the arracherra $19.50. The meat is cute medium (no choice in how it's cooked) but to me it's cooked to perfection. Not too rare, not to dry, I guess that's what medium is, right?  The chimichurri sauce give it great flavor and the rice makes the dish a complete meal.  The portion size is just right because i'm extremely full just eating the dish. I've ventured out from just trying the arracherra but some of the dishes were a miss.  They change their menu from time to time and I believe some of those dishes are now removed specifically the roasted meat over mashed potatoes.  I never eat dessert here because the ones I've tried never satisfy me. The warm chocolate cake is pretty bland and could be a little sweeter. If you want something sweet after the meal, I would recommend another raspberry mojito or something else sweet from the drink menu.

Something you can make at your home. For dinner, the arrachera. Something about the seasonings were just off. It was so so. I've had much better arrachera at bbqs in the summer. My friend had the jibarito from there which is usually one of my favorite sandwiches but I don't think Carnivale was able to prepare it right.

2011-02-28,5.0,"Had an absolutely wonderful time at Carnivale this weekend! My husband and I went here for restaurant week - I was enticed by the Yelp reviews as well as the lively, colorful pictures of their restaurant. You can see the restaurant from far away because it's in a huge building. It looks like it pretty much occupies an entire block! When we walked-in, I was impressed by the decor and the service that we got. There's complimentary coat check and multiple Maitre D's waiting to check us in - it kind of looked like a hotel check-in counter. We had reservations at 5:30 and we were seated promptly.  Our server was also very helpful. Since it was our first time, she explained to us the theme of the restaurant as well as all sections of their menu. She also gave us excellent drinks, appetizers and main dishes recommendations. We decided since restaurant week started, that we want the prix-fixe menu, but, one of the appetizers that she mentioned sounded really good, so we added that to our order. We had: Black Currant Mojito - Hands down the best mojito that I've ever had. I could barely taste the alcohol, but definitely felt it within a few sips. They also used cane sugar, which I think made it even more flavorful. Escolar Ceviche - Extremely delicious! There were only 5 pieces of fish, which was surprising because I'm used to ceviche being served in a bowl with chopped onion, cilantro etc. However, the fish was so soft and the sauce it came with: lemon, thyme, coriander and habanero puree were to die for! It complimented the fish really well. Potato soup - also delicious. I really liked the queso fresco in the soup. Moqueca - I forgot the white fish that they used, but it was really soft and fresh. The mussels and calamari were also cooked perfectly and I can taste how fresh they were! One of my pet-peeves is overcooked mussels because they get really rubbery, but they weren't like that. The curry sauce was also delicious - it didn't overpower the dish and I can still taste the flavor of the seafood itself. Pork Adobo - my husband had this and he really enjoyed it. I thought it was a little dry, but I only had a few bites. Tres Leches - By the time we reached the dessert course, we were already full! The cake was spongy and wet. I'm not sure if that's how it's supposed to be, but the flavor was really good and we enjoyed it. We'd definitely go back to Carnivale. Though, if it's not restaurant week, I think it can get a little pricey.",0.9982,0.775,0.205,0.019,0.5561791383219955

I LOVE this place and you can tell me they serve donkey meat (but please don't!) and I will continue to visit and eat here whenever I am in Chicago. I had an amazing meal at Carnivale and that makes it my favorite Chicago restaurant so far.  We went Friday night for dinner. Valet was only $10 (If I remember correctly). We went in and were surprised to learn the wait was.. wait for it..wait for it: one and a half hours!! Our group just looked at one another wondering if we would indeed wait that long. It turns out that the wait is actually for the main dining area, which if I may add is beautiful. Huge and very colorful umbrellas take over the ceiling and make this magnificent space a little carnival of its own. The dining room is very well decorated and although so many bright colors are used, it looks quite elegant. We decided to just seat in another area by the bar, which is not as attractive, but would save us 1 1/2 hours.  The food was so delicious! I tasted several different dishes and every single one was better than the previous. My friend ordered a steak, she wanted it medium but it was brought out medium rare. I tasted the medium rare steak and it was exquisite! I really cant believe she returned it! I had a seafood dish, which was prepared to perfection.  I almost took away a star because I ordered a Tres Leches for dessert and they brought me some chocolate thing that was NOT a Tres Leches cake! That needs to be taken off the menu. The waitress was happy to change it for a flan, so I decided not to take the star off. We also had a few drinks and an overall amazing time. They were playing Latin music which was very entertaining. I am really glad I got to visit this place, I really loved the food!",0.9969,0.781,0.199,0.02,0.6530280830280831

As we entered the main restaurant your greeted with a multi color architectural high ceiling restaurant.  As you walk your almost drawn to keep your head up so much just because your starring at everything since their is a lot of detail inside.  We ordered a few apps for the table that included: Empanadas: had great taste but wasn't something I got a wow effect from. Puertorican Pasteles: it was plated very fancy, but the taste was not as authentic.  Guacamole: was pretty good, they got the concept of adding the lemon juice and giving it that extra taste. Now onto dinner... I few of my friends went with a house special which was the flank steak with all the trimmings.  I observed as the plates came and the only thing I thought was..... we should have ordered more apps because the portions were pretty small. I actually had a shrimp, mussel and scallop dish ( kind of like a paella ) which i thought had some pretty good highlights.  The service for a table this large was not bad, they were coming by and asking how things were, we only asked a few times for re-fills.

I took my wife here on a Sunday night, usually places are slow so you get a little better attention, but this place was hoping like a friday all nighter party.  We had to wait a few minutes at the bar after getting our car valet parked (only $5) and checking our coats (for free).  The bar totally fooled me because it was kind of dark and quiet, with a few people hanging and one very busy bartender.  Soon after we got our drinks our buzzer went off for the table. Our hostess walked us from the cave of the bar into the colorful lit party dining room.  We walked in and it was so bright and colorful, but somehow not over the top.  The waiter was really friendly and gave us explainations of things on the menu without boring us to death about special cream sauces and what not. Anyway, to the food!  We started with an assortment of cured meats, there are three kinds you can order, but we could decide so we got the sampler, they were a good starter, the Jamón Serrano was suprisingly sweet, better with the mustard, the La Quercia was pretty average and the Chorizo Palacios was pretty tasted like spicy dried chorizo, which was good. My wife had the ""Churrasco"" - nicaraguan style wood grilled beef tenderloin, malanga goat cheese puree, arugula chimichurri, spicy beet salsa.  She got it medium-rare, usually when she orders a steak a don't look forward to tasting it because it's so rare it's chewy, which she likes, but when I tasted this it melted like butter, it was so good.  I would have been jealous I didn't get it if my steak wasn't so tasty. I got the ""Bife Angosto"" - wood grilled dakota farms new york strip, roasted potatoes, spanish chorizo, manchego cheese, chimichurri sauce (medium-well).  It tasted like an amazing steak topped with the seasonings for guacamole, sans avocado.  The potatoes it came with were just ""eh"", wish you could have gotten a side of more steak. Finally we finished off sharing a piece of Tres Leches, with blueberry tres leches cake.  She said she was stuffed and couldn't eat another bite, but it was son enticing she stole two big chunks of it, it was sweet, very sweet, but very good. Anyway, the food was awesome, the best meal since we came back from Paris a few months ago and the amtosphere was like a party but everyone behaving themselves.  The reason I took one star off was simply because of the prices, this places seems to do well enough that I think they could afford to drop their prices a bit and bring in a bigger crowd. I would definitely go back and recommend if for a one on one date or a group of people, it'd be a good place to take out of towners to show them some Chicago food culture that isn't pizza or hot dogs.",0.999,0.745,0.223,0.032,0.5426290043290044

I managed to eat dessert just a few times, and nothing disappointed.  The churros with caramel and chocolate sauces were really tasty and made fresh to order.  We also shared the giant sundae served in a pineapple and it was also very good, but definitely meant to share with friends, a few of them :) On top of all of that, the atmosphere is very fun, festive and lively.  The decor feels like a mambo parade should be coming through hourly, and on occasion it feels like it because they will have live music and dancing in the large bar area.  I prefer sitting upstairs in the loft area because it allows you a fantastic view of the whole place, and is a bit less noisy.  But no seat is a bad one. Parking - you CAN park on the street but you have to get pretty lucky with the new residential towers going up in the area.  And with valet being just $5, it's probably cheaper and easier to valet anyway.",0.9989,0.692,0.269,0.039,0.6195312249478917

The food is incredible. I've tried 3 ceviches and never had a bad one - their tuna is perfection, especially when topped with jalapeno and avocado. Such a clean flavor. The arepa appetizer is also really good if you're okay with something a bit heavier - love that polenta cake wrapper. For the entree, the churrascuro really can't be beat. We were also lucky enough to visit on a night when braised pork shoulder was the special, and it was seriously melt-in-your-mouth delicious (although, the homemade savory sausage on the side was not my favorite). For dessert, you can't go wrong with churros, especially dipped in rich, warm chocolate sauce and dulce de leche.  Drinks: go for the caipirinha(s), and you will feel right at home.    Final note: $5 valet. You can't beat it.",0.9888,0.786,0.197,0.017,0.6437830687830688

2011-01-11,5.0,"I work at a restaurant and asked the general manager and exec chef (well I didn't ask, but someone did) what their favorite restaurants in Chicago were. They both mentioned carnivale, so my expectations were elevated before even stepping through their door. First of all, hallelujah for $5 valet. I hate trying to find street parking, I have a tendency to park illegally on accident even though I spend 10 minutes checking for signs or yellow curbs or other reasons why parking there will cost me a $60 ticket. So yay for cheap valet. I made a reservation the same night like 2hours before I actually came, and though we were early we were sat immediately. We walked through the bar which looked nice and open which I like. Then we walked into the dining area. It's absolutely gorgeous. Beautiful high ceilings, huge colorful laterns hanging, bright colors and a wall made of wine racks which changing lights behind it. It gave the place great energy and ambiance. Now to the important part: food and drinks.  Drinks:  Mojito for my man: they are known for their mojitos, apparently they recently sold their millionth. Pretty solid, tasted good not too sweet. Prickly pear mojito for me. A tad too sweet, but that's what I get for ordering a flavored mojito. Side note: is prickly pear a fuchsia colored fruit? Food: Apps were arepa, ropa veija, and reviled ceviche. Yes I got three, I was hungry. don't hate. Ropa is their most popular, and rightly so. It was delicious and the flavors were well thought out and perfect. The escolar ceviche was beautiful and probably my favorite. I get escolar (super white tuna) when ever I get sushi so I was excited to see it on the menu at a Spanish fusion place. It's got the perfect mix of creamy fish, spicy bite, lime and vinegar cleanliness...it great as a palate cleanser. The arepa was good and juicy, with some nice polenta cake to even out the richness. Entrees: Churrasco for the man. It was a perfect medium, which seems difficult for some places to execute. Only thing I wished was that the chimichurri had more bite. It also seemed creamy which is weird to me. The short rib for me. Holy moly it was AMAZING. Super tender, came apart with a fork, and seasoned beautifully. I love a good short rib. Dessert: My man had a port. It was a bit strong and not my favorite. He was kinda meh about it too. I got apparently the best or most popular domestic dessert wine. The far niente dolce, surprise it was very sweet...but fit well with the tres leches cake, which was fantastic. It had a rustic feel to it like maybe they grind their own flour or something, but the moistness was on point and whatever basil mousse they put on the side is a stroke of genius. Our server, jayse was lively and made great recommendations. He was friendly, efficient and a perfect mix of what me and my boyfriend like in a server, which is oftentimes, seeing as how we both are servers, difficult. It was a wonderful Sunday dinner, the best I've had in a long while. Give it a try, it won't disappoint. Plus it was about $200, with the tip, which isn't bad for 4 drinks, 3 apps, 2 enterees, 1 dessert and exceptional service.",0.9997,0.636,0.32,0.045,0.6486377335744422

2011-01-08,4.0,"I've probably been here a dozen times over the years, but this is my first review.  From start to finish you'll enjoy everything about Carnivale. The location is very easy to deal with whether you drive in from the burbs, take the El, walk or taxi. You can often find street parking, but the valet is reasonable ($5). When you walk in, you'll immediately notice the vibrant colors and over sized lamps and mirrors. Plan to arrive 15-30 minutes before your reservation so you can enjoy a drink at the bar. The specialty drinks are delicious try the Caipirinha, Red Zinger, Carnivale Martini or even a frozen Margarita. The main dining area is something you just have to see. Thirty-foot ceilings, huge mirrors and lampshades in dazzling colors are impressive. My favorite apps are the Ropa Vieja (worthy of 5 stars by itself), Tacos de Pescado and the Remolachas.  The wine list is more than adequate and compares to any upper end restaurant in Chicago. For dinner get the Arrechera, the braised Short Ribs, the Pollo (Peruvian Style) or the Catch of the day. For dessert you must try the Pineapple Split. If there is one complaint I have from last night's dinner, and most other visits here, it's the speed the dishes arrive at the table - it's just too fast. So, to solve this problem, take your time between courses, because even if you instruct your server to keep things leisurely paced, I haven't had one actually do this.",0.9876,0.834,0.141,0.025,0.5197916666666667

As you know, I am a huge fan of the apps. I wasn't disappointed. The star of the evening was the Flores y Camarones -- shrimp, cheese, habanero... Give me. Give me more. The fish tacos and ceviche was delicious as well but those shrimp... I am still thinking about them. It was dinner time. I had some hesitation. Last time, dinner wasn't a hit. BUT.

She answered all my questions, treated my group with respect and was a fun part of the evening. So, since we were now bffs, I took her suggestion on an entree.

When you enter the dining area it feels like somebody should say, TAHDAHH!! This is a vast room with soaring ceilings and a whimsical decor including what looks like giant brightly colored fez hat light fixtures. Colorganza everywhere, festive music, oversized everything!! Its really a fun atmosphere.  The fare is nuevo Latino and it seems most if not all Latin cultures are represented somewhere on the menu. We started with chips and guac. Not too adventurous but these are really good! The chips are obviously fresh made in house with very delicate layers of crispy salty goodness. The guac is nice and chunky - just how I like it. It was enough for the four of us. We also shared the special king crab legs app --- so deelish with a garlic cilantro butter.  For my entree I had the Churrasco - a Nicaraguan style wood grilled beef tenderloin with malanga goat cheese puree, arugula chimichurri, spicy beet salsa. Dear Diary, I am in love.... 90 percent of the time I opt for fish or vegetarian options but our great server Jessee sang it's praises so that I had to give it a try. Thank you, Jessee. The meat was cooked a perfect medium rare and so tender and just superb.   The menu provides beaucoup options and our choices did not disappoint. Considering all the other aspects of Carnivale & comparing to other similar restaurants I think it's also very reasonably priced.  Honorable mention because I like the fact that they make an effort to obtain ingredients from local organic farmers and farmers that use ethical sustainable practices.  A party of four at Carnivale on a Friday night left very happy and plan on coming back soon.",0.9986,0.765,0.229,0.006,0.5924075167256986

Ummm... what's the point of making a reservation if i still have to wait for 35 minutes for a table? That gave me a bad feeling about the place but they ended up seating us a lot closer to 9 so I'm not sure what that was all about.  The place is beautifully decorated with fun bright colors.  The food was delicious.  I had the arepa appetizer and skirt steak.  The mojtios are also fantastic.  I would definitely recommend it but you have to make a reservation as the waiting area was packed even at 9 oclock.,0.9822,0.741,0.223,0.036,0.7444444444444445

Like, the waiting area was swarming with groups of people and I had to run away to catch my breath while waiting for our table. So, make reservations and definitely go elsewhere if you want a quiet dinner. This place is enormous, colorful and seemed filled with large birthday groups. Anyway, our server was great and the food was pretty good (and they make one tasty mojito). To start, we split the arepa, ropa vieja, and the salad special. The arepa was a big hit with J  but I felt the pork was a little fatty. The rope vieja was all sorts of awesome though. Braised beef and plaintains? Yes yes yes! My favorite of the evening was the special salad - local greens (it was this thick purple spinach that I've never seen before and have been obsessing over ever since), marcona almonds, local cheddar, onions, Michigan apple and a chili serrano vinaigrette. Swoon! We should have stopped there but also had the pernil and arrachera (Maria's fault!). The pork shoulder was very sweet. The arrachera was beefy goodness and honestly, you can put chimichurri over anything and I will swallow it whole.  Dessert was a little disappointing. We ordered the churros and they were really crunchy, like, a good baguette almost gum-cutting crunchy. Luckily, our server brought J out a little birthday treat - a sticky toffee cake topped with pineapple sticks. Quite tasty. So why only 3 stars? This type of restaurant just really isn't my scene. When I want ethnic food of any kind (Mexican, Vietnamese, Japanese, Cuban, etc etc) I am much happier when I eat in a small, no frills, family run place - they are my happy place. Swanky lighting and bright wallpaper always seems to detract from my experience. Of course, if J wanted to come back for a special occasion, I would too and eat a bunch of beef and pray that they have those purple spinach leaves again.",0.9978,0.731,0.238,0.031,0.5409639953542391

I clearly ordered a margarita because the bartender asked if I wanted salt. He placed a martini in front of me and when I said I ordered a margarita he looked at me like I was nuts (hello, you asked if I wanted salt). Ok, no biggie. As we now approached 8:25, I went to the hostess stand to check on our 8pm reservation I was told I would have to speak to the manager. Really? All I asked was how we were looking for time and the hostess couldn't answer that? (STRIKE  1-If you are running late, let people know. When they call you on it, an apology would be nice). By chance a table for 2 miraculously opened up. We walked 10 feet to first table next to the dining room entrance. Literally. When I explained to the hostess that we were celebrating our 5 year anniversary and a nicer table would be much appreciated she rolled her eyes and said I needed to speak to the manager. When I went back to the hostess stand to speak to the manager, I asked if they saw the notation that this was a special event for us. He said yes the note was there (apparently this is the 5 year anniversary table). Exasperated, he found us a table in the side room, much quieter but less beauty of the main dining room. Strike 2 Our waiter was pleasant and immediately took our drink and appetizer order. The he disappeared. We ordered the 3 selection ceviche and the fish tacos. We added some guac too as I was starving at this point. The ceviche came (small serving, good-not great), the guac came (good, but small, great chips though), the tacos never appeared. When I asked our waiter, he claimed we never ordered them. Apparently he is the bartender's relation. Waiters-If you or the kitchen makes a mistake, just apologize and ask the customer if they still would like that. Don't debate them on if they ordered it, especially if they watched you write it down. Strike 3. My wife had the seafood special which was very good (a white fish with a cream shrimp sauce). I had the skirt steak as I have seen other people post it was good. Well, apparently others have not had a good latin skirt steak. Again, it was good, but was lacking in seasoning. I have had better at a Pepe's frankly. And just served over rive and beans? A little roasted vegetables on the side would have been nice. We did get a small but nice fig cake and ice cream on the house for our anniversary, which was the first mention from our waiter that night. Beautiful place. Mediocre food. Lousy service.

2010-10-22,4.0,"This review is long overdue. Carnivale has become one of our special occasion go-to places in the city. Not only because of Carnivale's fun atmosphere, but because of the delicious assortment of food and drinks. Housed in what was a former warehouse, the first time you walk into the main dining room in Carnivale really takes your breath away. Extremely high ceilings and just about every bright color imaginable line the walls, ceilings, and décor at this place - really something. For the best dining experience, I would recommend that when making a reservation, you ask to be seated in the main dining room that really has a party environment. If you are looking for something more intimate and quiet, there are also smaller closed off areas off the main dining room, as well as upstairs.  We have dined here several times, but I always have a few favorites you simply can't go wrong with. I love that they use local organic ingredients and offer seasonal dishes, ensuring that their food is fresh, and you can really taste the difference.  For starters, try the ropa vieja appetizer. It is amazing - blending the flavorful & spicy taste of succulent braised beef over a sweet plantain disc.  My favorite dinner is the arrachera grilled skirt steak which is topped in a spicy and flavorful chimichurri sauce and sweet red onions - SO GOOD. This is seriously some of the most tender and juicy skirt steak I've had in the city. As if this weren't filling enough, you also get a very generous side of rice and red beans.  Carnivale also has a great variety of fun drinks. I recommend the raspberry mojito which is really refreshing and the frozen white sangria made with peach schnapps, pisco brandy, white grape juice, and white wine. Just don't drink it too fast like I do and get a brain freeze. I can also vouch for the brunch - try the chilaquiles & down them with some mimosas. I won't give Carnivale a full 5 stars mainly for their desserts & price. I would probably say that desserts are probably the weakest part of Carnivale's menu. I've tried the churros and the brownies and was not all that impressed. Also, expect to spend about $50/person when you include the appetizer & dinner; not even including wine or other specialty drinks or dessert. Nonetheless, Carnivale is the perfect place to dine for that special occasion, or to stop in for a few drinks at the fun bar area. What's neat about the bar area is that you can now order appetizers there. They go all out for certain holidays; there was one Valentine's Day where they had stilt walkers walking around the main dining room and all of the drinks had heart-shaped hard candy garnishes. Definitely make a reservation, because they tend to be very busy, especially on the weekends & holidays.",0.9989,0.753,0.222,0.026,0.4450793650793652
2010-10-21,4.0,"The Chicago dining scene seems to be as tenuous and tempestuous as the Hollywood clubs/bars; patrons are fickle and the ""hottest restaurant"" you have to book at least 2 weeks in advance one season can suddenly become that 3/5-star establishment everyone says ""was really good when it first came out...."" So when a restaurant manages to retain a good reputation among foodies despite having been on the map for several years, you know it's earned it through some legitimate praises. Carnivale is one of those restaurants I just hadn't yet made my way to since living downtown, but had heard of repeatedly throughout the years, always in pleasant, satisfied terms. When my girlfriend said she'd made reservations there, I was excited.  I did a sampling of 3 ceviches: salmon, hiramasa (yellowtail) and tuna. Hiramasa had a firmer, sweeter, less fatty than the salmon or tuna. each of them had a serious spicy kick to it,and had much less liquid than i'm used to - the tuna actually looked straight up like sashimi with jicama, avocado and jalapeno, but i'm not complaining because i love sashimi. I tried the plantain side, which was delicious, but plantains are awesome so no surprise there. I also split fish tacos with my girlfriend which were less than awesome (for you west coasters, I'm pretty sure Rubio's would have laid the smackdown on these tacos). Raspberry mojito was refreshing and well made, generous with the puree. The decor is a definite conversation piece, though I don't know if I'd recommend Carnivale if you're looking to have a lot of group conversation or an intimate date - it's loud, it's a party atmosphere, it's aptly named.",0.9957,0.753,0.216,0.031,0.6039094650205762
2010-10-19,4.0,"The food:  As our apps, we tried the salmone cerviche and the ropas vejas which were both very tasty.  In our group of 5, we got 4 different dishes.  My favorite would have to be the skirt steak.  The meat is so thin, yet so tender and the flavorings were amazing.  The pork, braised short ribs and ribeye were also good as well...just not as good as the skirt steak.  For dessert, the menu makes you want to order everything on there.  The prices were great for what you get.  We got the pineapple sundae and the churro's.  Both were absolutely divine.  I enjoyed every bit of both.

2010-10-17,3.0,"The short version: We really enjoyed our evening at Carnivale. Glad we experienced it but if we had the same amount of money to spend on a night out, we'd probably try a new place rather than going back. We had a great evening and very good food, but nothing knocked my socks off.   The long version: We had 8pm reservations on Saturday night for our anniversary. We arrived at 8pm sharp and checked in at the hostess stand. ""Oh great, she says. Here's your buzzer. Your table will be ready when it goes off."" She didn't give us any sort of time frame, so we walked over to the really crowded bar and tried to flag down a bartender. This took approximately 20 minutes. Finally, we flag one down, order our drinks and as we're closing up at the bar, our buzzer goes off. So, expect that your reservation will mean that you only have to wait 30 minutes vs an hour. Boo.  They take us to our table, which was in a smaller dining area behind the bar. It wasn't in the large room, which we liked because it was a little cozier and romantic and we were celebrating an anniversary. We still had our mojitos (raspberry for me, regular mint for him- both were Delicious!) from the bar, so we ordered the cheese sampler of 3 to start while we looked over the menu. We had the Rosemary Manchego which was delicious, the hook's cheddar, which was also very good, and the pleasant ridge reserve, which was my favorite of the three.  For the next course, we had a ceviche sampler of 3. We had the special of the night which was a white fish, which was nice and mild, the shrimp- which had a great flavor to it and the Hiramasa, which had cilantro, so I was happy. All three were very fresh and good, but the portions of the sampler were a bit smaller than I expected.  Next we moved on to the main course. My husband ordered the Costilla De Res, which he loved. He said it was one of those meals that if it was socially acceptable, he'd lick his plate. I had a few bites and agreed that it was very good. I had the Churrasco. It was cooked perfectly, and I loved the beet salsa and the spiciness of the dish. I wish I could have tasted the goat cheese a little more, but it was good. Not lick-my-plate-good, but good nonetheless.  Over the course of our meal, we had a bunch of different drinks. After our initial mojitos, I went with the traditional mint mojito and my husband ordered a flight of the aged rum. All were good, but we definitely liked the Ron Zacapa, which had a great hint of honey in the aftertaste that went really well with our cheeses. We ordered a bottle of Cabernet to go with our main course, which was delicious and reasonably priced.  We finished our meal with an order of the Churros. One order was enough to split between the two of us. These were just ok. I would probably skip them next time or try something different.  Our server was very good and knew the menu well. We asked for a lot of suggestions and had a lot of questions and he was on top of everything. He'd come back to check on things and ask us about particular items, comparing notes on the flavor, so we felt that he was really well versed in the menu and did a great job helping us choose items. I will say that there were a few times during the night, particularly after we got our ceviches, that he didn't appear for a while, and because we hadn't ordered our entree yet, we were worried that it would take forever for our entree to come out. But our food arrived about 15 minutes after we ordered it-faster than the other courses, which was amazing.  So, all in all, we had a very good experience at Carnivale. I'm glad we went and we really enjoyed everything we had. That being said, it was a place we were happy to try once but probably won't return again.",0.9996,0.765,0.232,0.003,0.5614692020942024

I tried to call and let them know, but after waiting on hold for over 15 minutes, I somehow got disconnected - and by that time we were at the restaurant anyway.  Our reservation was at 9p.m., we didn't get seated until 10p.m. I would've been more understanding, but this was the 2nd time that I was seated an hour after my actual reservation time.  And walking back to our table, I would say about 25% of the tables were empty and already re-set for the next customers. We got drinks at the bar and I had a sip of my husband's Carnivale Margarita - it was delicious and potent. My mojito left quite a bit to be desired. It wasn't strong, nor was it good. Plus, it is really difficult to get a drink at the bar. They need to add about 3 more bartenders to deal with the number of customers they have.  When our little buzzer finally went off, they walked us to the back of the restaurant, up the stairs and to the far back room up there. There were only about 4 other tables up there, so unfortunately it really took away from the fun music and buzzing atmosphere that I loved before. We did ask to sit in the dining room (which is where they seat everyone with reservations) however I would ask to sit in the great open room on the first floor. Very fun to people watch and be surrounded by the bold colors and funky pictures on the wall.  The appetizers were great - GET THE ROPA VIEJA! Honestly, one of my most favorite appetizers ever. And get the Hook's Cheddar cheese - we did a cheese plate with 2 Hooks Cheddar and Manchego and loved all of it, especially the jam that comes with it. It compliments the cheese SO well!  I had the Costilla de Res and enjoyed it, it was tender but a little dry. Everyone else liked their dishes as well - we had the Chuleta, Pernil, Arrachera and Pollo. I just wasn't very impressed with the food - and I hate to say that, but it was really just meh for me - and from what I heard, everyone else.  For dessert we had the churros and brownies - the churros were amazing. Reminded me of the delicious donuts you get at fairs!  I can't say if I'd go back - or bring friends from out of town. Our food was pretty disappointing, as well as the hour wait with a reservation, and the service in the bar was not speedy nor friendly. We all had a good time - but I think is because we were with a good group. By the end of the meal, we all wanted to just go home instead of out dancing because it was near midnight. I think next time we'll bring friends to Nacional 27 - I've had amazing food there and delicious drinks that knock my butt to the floor from very friendly bartenders.  If you do go to Carnivale - it is a fun atmosphere and the interior is very funky and bold.  And valet is only $5.  Make sure to go to  chicagohalfoff.com  to get $50 gift cards for just $25. Make sure to watch for them, they sell out quickly.",0.9986,0.74,0.199,0.061,0.5628888888888888
2010-09-27,4.0,"Decided this would be the place to celebrate a friend's birthday this past Saturday evening.   We called for a reservation and they told us they had nothing open for a party of 6 until 10PM...we took it. We showed up @ 9 to have a couple of drinks @ their bar. The bar area was really nice and spacious as there were many people trying to get drinks. Pretty creative drink list...I originally went with the Victoria's Secret (Svedka Raspberry vodka, cranberry juice, limonada, ginger soda) and then an Alegria (Svedka Clementine vodka, pineapple juice, limonada,cilantro, ginger). The latin guy behind the bar was working his ass off by turning drinks out at a rapid pace. I told him he was doing a great job and he told me he was tired of making mojitos. While drinking we asked for a buzzer and were told we can't get one until our whole group was there. Luckily 5 of us had made it by 10. We started with the Ceviche tasting (all five for $29)...the Shrimp ceviche was the best by far. For my meal, I thought the Pernil would be the best option. The Pernil is Rum glazed pork shoulder, fried plantains Puerto Rican rice and beans. The was a really good meal..I could taste the rum in the pork...really good flavor!!! It needed to be good because we had a nice wait for our food. Great pics on all of the walls as they even had some provocative pics in certain areas...one in particular is one with a woman exposing her chest (funny that a kid was sitting in the area).  We were done around midnight and were looking for somewhere else to have a drink. We decided to go to the Tasting Room, but thanks to the yelp phone app we found out they closed @ midnight. We said hey the bar is still open here, so lets just go back in. We wound up closing the joint. Good times @ Carnivale",0.9817,0.862,0.116,0.022,0.6047619047619048

Someday when Groupon sends me a Carnivale deal, I'll be buying that. This is hands down Chicago's BEST restaurant. I cannot say enough. My dictionary doesn't have enough complimentary words for Carnivale. If you haven't been, you are seriously missing out on a one of a kind experience. If you have been- you know how amazing this place is.  Carnivale is an EXPERIENCE for your senses. Every sense is titilitated and tingled and tickled at Carnivale. First is sense of sight. It's so amazing and preposterous and over the top that you feel you've been hit over the head with an anvil. It's jaw dropping. It's bright orange and pink and yellow. It's sexy and energetic. It's flair and spice.. it's DETAILS. Then smell. Oh the smell. If I could bottle it and spray my house with it, I would. At the very least, I'd like my house to smell like their raspberry mojito. Or maybe their ropa vieja.  The sounds- a sexy beat- Latin and fun and vibrant.  You'll wish you knew how to salsa dance- and after a few mojitos, you might even give it a whirl.  The feel... of the heavy velvet curtains, the texture of the food and mojito as it rushes past your lips.... Which brings me to TASTE! Oh Lord. Taste. Is this what a slice of heaven truely tastes like? Is this what perfection tastes like? Is this where the term ""melt in your mouth"" came from? I've yet to order something I didn't love.  In the past I took my sales region to Carnivale when everyone was in town. I was the ""local"" rep here in Chicago and I could have taken them to ANY restaurant in the city, on my company dime. I chose Carnivale. People from rural areas, people from big cities- all came to Carnivale at my suggestion. They didn't know what hit them. People looked dizzy during the meal. That was 3 years ago and they still talk about it. The place is THAT amazing. When I was unable to attend a close friend's wedding in the Dominican Republic, I took them to Carnivale for dinner and drinks for their wedding gift. I couldn't think of a better place to treat 2 people I love lots! When a friend texted me and asked if I'd be willing to be her ""plus one"" at a private event for a group she tutors kids with, I thought eh.... I don't know any of these people, and they will probably try to get me to volunteer and I simply don't have time for more activities in my social calendar. I was going to say no until she mentioned, that it was at this place called Carnivale. Guess what? I got all dressed up and attended- with a smile on my face!!!  When I turned 30 and my then boyfriend gave me the option of going to ANY restaurant in the entire city where did I want to go, without hesitation? You guessed it, Carnivale!! When I was stressed out with a new job and a move to a new apartment, among other things, what did my then boyfriend do to cheer me up? He planned an evening at Carnivale.  Anytime there is an event, an occasion or a payday and I get to pick my posion, it's always Carnivale. I cannot say enough about Carnivale. It is the best of the best.

The empanada de maiz I had was stuffed with roasted corn and spinach, and the cotija cheese melted everything into a savory marriage.  The huge loft-like warehouse space is rich with vibrant colors and enormous mirrors and lamps hang throughout.  And to top it all off, our server, Anton was brilliant.

There's something to please everyone from the die-hard foodie to the see or be seen crowd.  There might be some sticker shock - but everything has it's price and this just happens to be worth it. The waitstaff is friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes on the menu. Also, they don't make you (and by you, I mean ME) feel like an idiot when trying to pronounce some of the Latin dishes - HUGE plus in my book.  Food is outstanding. We started out with the Ropa Vieja and Flores y Camarones (basically open faced shrimp tacos). The camarones were AMAZING - the medley of flavors complimented each other well and just brought a complex taste to such a simple dish. We also ordered the large portion of guac, and if I have a complaint about Carnivale, it's their price-to-portion ratio on the guac. $14 for the large portion only yielded about 2 tablespoons of guac per person at our table (5 peeps total). Perhaps that is the ""healthy"" amount, but it's just my personal opinion that guac should be consumed until the point of feeling sick.  For entree I ordered the pernil, which didn't seem quite as yummy as the other dishes. The pork was a little dry and the rice/beans flavorless. I had bites of the Arrachera and Churrasco - and I immediately was hit with order envy.  I'd recommend coming to this place with a large group of people versus taking a date here.

We had reservations for my mom's birthday for 8pm and arrived there at about 7:50.  I checked us in at the hostess desk and was handed a buzzer thingie and was told, verbatim: ""just give us a couple minutes to get your table together.""   Ok, so I was already slightly annoyed because why the hell am I being handed a freaking buzzer like I'm at Chilis?  But fine, I smile and say no problem and go back over to rest of my party.  There was 7 of us, so I can understand that they may need to pull some tables together.  That being said, there were about 6 tables of 4 in sight that had ""reserved"" markers on them. Tick tock.. tick tock.. now it's 8:15 and my dad goes back over to the counter to see what the heck is going on.  He comes back and says, the hostess told me that they are running thirty minutes behind. Really?  So, then, what.. she just lied when she said to give them a few minutes?  *sigh*. tick tock... it's 8:40 when we finally get buzzed and led back to our table.  The waitress came over pretty quickly after to take our drink order and appetizer order.  This seemed promising since we were incredibly hungry by this point and at least would have something to eat while we waited. Well, that would have worked except that we were done eating our appetizers (they were brought by someone else) for about 20 minutes before she came back over to even take our dinner order.  On top of that my brother hadn't even received his beverage. Things moved pretty slowly after that.  Thank god the food was as fantastic as usual or the whole night would have sucked.  Too bad they can't get their shit together to handle a Saturday night.  If I wanted to stand in line for an overbooked seat that I thought I'd reserved I'd fly United.",0.8995,0.802,0.117,0.081,0.48489583333333336
2010-08-07,1.0,"I have been to Carnivale several times because I like the food, but I do not think I am going to go back again because of the really bad service that i received last night. I wanted to have the Chuleta but when I started ordering the server told me that they serve the pork ""medium"" but wanted to know if I wanted it cooked a different way. I thought this was strange because pork is a meat that NEEDS to be cooked thoroughly...when I questioned her about it she was very short with me which is completely unacceptable because asking if eating semi-raw pork is safe to eat is a reasonable question...in my mind. Since I didn't have anything verified by my server I decided to have the Pernil instead. I've had this dish before and it's delicious...but has a fundamental flaw: NO VEGGIES at all it it and no veggie garnish...they literally serve rice with beans, sweet plantains and the pernil so I generally ask for a little bit of the house salad garnish on the plate just to cut some of the fat/sweetness on the plate and they usually understand and oblige. Last night the server REFUSED. I asked her if I could just have a few leaves and she STILL said no even when I told her that It had been done about 6 times before as an alternative she suggested that I pay 10 dollars for their heirloom tomato salad and have that served with the meal...I asked her if I could have a 1/2 portion because I did not want to pay 10 bucks for something that (in my opinion) should be on the plate as a garnish or a part of the dish anyway. nope, no 1/2 portion. When the dish came out it looked way different that how i've had it in the past...this time it was topped with a top of chopped up olives (who the hell does that to pernil???) Also...Everyone else at my table had salad as part of their dish OR as a garnish and was nice enough to chip in and give me some which made the dish better..it was a ridiculous/unnecessary when all the kitchen had to do was give me a few goddamn salad leaves.",-0.9854,0.838,0.04,0.123,0.3876190476190476

2010-08-06,3.0,"Soooo one of my friends had a tiny birthday party here. I'd never been before. I loved the decor and the atmosphere, but my food was eh, the server was eh (he seriously laughed at me [and not in any sort of nice way] when I asked what the less-spicy choices on the menu were -- yes, man, I realize where I am but it's not like I picked the restaurant) - I don't know, maybe it's just because I've never had Latin American food before but I just wasn't super impressed. We ordered the guacamole for the appetizer (holy huge! and very lime-y), and I liked all the platanos everywhere. I had the pork chop (I apologize for not remembering the actual name of the dish) but it was a little bland, I felt like I could have made something very similar at home. It came with mashed platanos with bacon...which was really interesting, I liked it. Kinda pricey (for 4 of us, and only 2 boozy drinks, our bill was about $160) and I felt like we were paying more for the decorations than the food, if that makes any sense. At any rate, my birthday-celebrating friend loves the place, though, and he had a great night so I was happy.",0.9887,0.705,0.214,0.081,0.6335

My friend who had just visited Chicago and recommended this place. I am glad we followed her advice! We started with the Ropa Vieja. It was amazing. The meat was incredibly tender and the plantains were the perfect complement. We also had the ceviche as an appetizer. I thought it was okay-- the chips were my favorite part, although the fish did taste fresh. I also had a strawberry mojito and it was delicious! The perfect pairing for a Latin fiesta! For dinner, I had the chuleta. The pork chop was pretty tasty, not dry. However, I didn't like the sauce very much, so that dish was okay in my book. Finally, we ended with the blueberry tres leche cake. I have never had a tres leche cake before, but the the moistness was a nice unexpected surprise. The blueberry flavor wasn't overpowering, so that was nice. Overall, the dinner was pretty pricey ~$100 for the two of us.

I was very impressed and anyone that knows me would say that is not an easy task to accomplish.  My appetizer was delish as well. I can't remember what it was called but it had Amish chicken and iberico cheeses. Yum, yum, yum. I also had two drinks, Victoria's Secret and the summer punch. The VS is very sweet and fruity. The Summer punch is strong and has a kick to it.  We also decided to split the brownie sundae. It was heaven!  All in all, I highly recommend Carnivale. It has great food and a great atmosphere.

2010-07-28,4.0,"Don't be fooled by this venue's appearance from the outside!   Its magnificent inside!!!    Cocktail Area Spacious!  This was enough for our wedding party and guests to enjoy complimentary hors d'oeuvres and open bar drinks before seating.   The front bar is fully stocked with crafty bartenders that we're very knowledge with mixed drinks.   Everyone had an opportunity to mingle and find their table assignments before opening the red curtain to the grand ballroom.   It felt like we were waiting for the show to begin. Grand Ballroom Extreme colors are the words to describe the grand ballroom.   Once the Carnivale staff opened the red curtains, they unveiled the grand color scheme of the ballroom.    See my attached pictures.   The interior design is nothing I've ever seen before - hugh mirrors, dark color fabrics, polka dot lamp shades, etc.   It felt like a crossover of an circus carnival and a Las Vegas venue.    Picture frames are plastered with female celebrities in their most erotic poses (I.e. Beyonce, Marilyn Manroe, Madonna, and Naomi Campbell...just to name a few).  According to the Chicago locals, this was once a nightclub converted into an event venue restaurant.   Seating is plentiful as they maximized space by provided dining spaces on the second floor to the alcove rooms, and central areas.     They dedicated a room for the photobooth, a room for the candy room, and another bar right next to the dance floor.   The plush couch seating along the privacy rooms was a nice touch for the after dinner festivities for use to lounge and shots....shots...shots... shots..!!!   youtube.com/watch?v=XNtT… Dining Experience I have to take away one star for the fact that they ran out of beef.    The head waiter had informed our table that they miscalculated on the number of beef dishes.    He apologized and offered the chicken dish.   I was annoyed but forgave the kitchen staff.   Unfortunately, the chicken was dry and didn't work well the green curry sauce.  As for the dessert, the cheesecake was delicious with a creamy filling and smooth texture.     Our dining experience was accompanied by their house Malbec wine with was quite tangy with a suttle hint of sweet berries.  Major highlight:  The freshly made guacamole dip for the chips.   WOW!   We finished two bowls of it!  Ask for it! Useful Notes - Restrooms are a walk.   Located in the back of the ballroom, head down the stairs, into the underground basement. - Parking:  Opted for the valet parking.   Street parking is limited and you could be walking for blocks. - Handicap friendly:  Yes.  They have an elevator for handicap guests at the front lobby.   You might have difficulty for the restrooms. - Ideal for weddings and grand venues with over 100-200 guests. - Video Projector & Slide Show:  If you're going to showcase a video presentation, you might want to consider renting a huge projector screen (aim for 20 ft by 20 ft).    Carnivale provides a small screen that didn't quite fit the bill.  Most of us had to leave our table and corral around the dance floor to watch the presentation.  Again, this venue space is huge!",0.9957,0.816,0.15,0.034,0.5626825396825396
2010-07-28,4.0,I've been here a couple of times and every time is just awesome. Love the commitment to local ingredients and I love that you know which farms they're using in certain dishes. Their cocktails are DELICIOUS. Muddled fruit in an already tasty mojito is a good thing.  Their Ropa Vieja is obscenely good. The Pernil (rum glazed pork shoulder) is the first thing I ever had there and it's killer. Most recently I had the Arrachera (grilled skirt steak) and it was the closest I've gotten to Cuban heaven since my meal in Miami's Little Havana. My uncle had the Arroz Con Mariscos (like a seafood pallela) and it was the best thing at the table that night which is saying a lot. I'd really love to go back and take advantage of their delicious looking meat and cheese plates.  The desserts are pretty largely portioned and not that expensive comparatively so I would recommend splitting one or two per table if you'd like a little sweet treat. The most recent time I was there we split the churros which were good but not the best I've ever had.  The space is large and vibrant. Very colorful decor. A little loud which was good because we brought my little 2.5 year old cousin with us and she loved it! She got up and danced to the salsa music and munched on chips and guacamole and some rice. Adorable! Might not be THE BEST place for all young kids but for this kid whose family loves to eat out it was perfect.,0.9959,0.728,0.245,0.026,0.5464536340852131

I couldn't believe it. The food was great. I ended up getting a grilled prime ribeye (or something) with arugula and avocado mayo sandwiched between - wait for it - fried plantains. It was awesome. The plantains were perfect sandwich bread; they weren't too brittle, but separated cleanly with each bite, and they had that awesome fried fragrance with minimal oil.

2010-07-23,5.0,"Carnivale has easily become one of my favorite Chicago restaurants. Some restaurants try to be more than what they are - a bar/club/pub/restaurant/gastro-lounge/coffeehouse all in one, maybe. But Carnivale takes its status as a bar/clubby lounge/restaurant seriously and does not seem to put more emphasis on one facet than the other. THE DECOR: Carnivale is visually appealing. If you have the blahs or are having a bad day, your spirits will automatically rise once you enter. Carnivale is more festive than a truck of Christmas sweaters. Bright colors are everywhere, and the rooms are very open.  THE SERVICE: Pretty deec. Our waiter was very kind but disappeared for stretches that didn't seem to make sense, especially since other times he'd come to our table more regularly than others. So while that aspect was inconsistent, I wasn't in a hurry (and I'm guessing, then, that getting dinner here - which we did - is preferable to constraining this place to the lunch hour).  THE DRINKS: I started with a raspberry mojito, which was pretty good but not mind-blowing. Their selection of wine and other spirits is tremendous. They have an entire menu for rum and tequila! Pretty legit. Anyway, the raspberry mojito was nice but the seeds in it kind of took away from it. Later, I got the regular mojito. It was absolutely fantastic! It was a perfect blend of refreshing, lime-y, minty, and not too strong. A+. THE FOOD: I don't know where to begin. My sister and I got a three cevhiche platter, which was nice, but a bit stingy to be quite honest. The haramasa was good, and the shrimp was different in that it was marinated in salsa, so less acidic but still tasty. The tuna ceviche! I haven't tasted such an incredible blend of flavors in a while. Each piece was a thin slice of jicama topped with a piece of tuna, topped with a piece of avocado, topped with a small jalapeno slice. (""But wait! There's more!"") Once you eat that part, you taste the olive oil that was used in the dish, and there's a bit of a salty aftertaste as well. I was raving about it so much that you can bet I sounded like a Food Network-controlled drone.  The guacamole was good and packed with lime. But I don't know if I'd get it again because it wasn't very special. The same is true for the plantains, which verged on overcooked. The special was an open-faced quesadilla - basically shrimp on a tortilla with almost-carmelized cheese. It was delicious! I didn't know what an open-faced quesadilla would entail, but I guess my curiosity was rewarded. My sister and I both got the flank steak with chimichurri, and it was amazing! It was incredibly tender and moist (although I hate that word. I would've eaten more, but the food coma was setting in. I also didn't really care for the beans and rice, which weren't very well seasoned and seemed almost too well done. Carnivale is a unique restaurant that accomplishes what it sets out to do. Fun night out with a group? Check. Reprieve from Michigan Avenue if you're a first time visitor? Check. Just going to the bar for mojitos? Check. It's a jack-of-all trades that refuses to neglect any details, and for that it gets an easy five stars.",0.9972,0.781,0.166,0.053,0.6279410866910867

For the main course I ordered the Atun - Seared Tuna, which was honestly to die for. It was so buttery and flavorful and it came on a bed of spicy fufu (idk? it was delicious)! I ate my ENTIRE plate. I never do that. My boyfriend had the braised short ribs, and he definitely liked mine much better. He said it was lacking in the taste department and kinda dry.

We ordered three ceviches as an appetizer including Shrimp, Mixto, and Tuna Tiradito.  My favorite was the shrimp.  It was served over a bed of ice to keep it chilled and the presentation was beautiful. Next, we ordered a bottle of wine, which ended up being just okay.  $32 was the cheapest bottle of wine on the menu and I knew it wouldn't taste extravagant.   For dinner, I ordered the Arrachera and the wifey, Churrasco.  When we received our food, it was evident that the dish my wife and I both had been seeking was before me.  I tasted the Arrachera meat and I have to say, it was the best flank or skirt steak I've ever eaten.  It was perfectly flavorful with hints of being cooked over wood or charcoal.  It was also perfectly cooked and perfectly tender.  With the chimichurri on top, this was one of the best meals I've ever eaten.   Then, I let my wife taste it.  She too fell in love with it and expressed that she didn't want her ""Churrasco"" any more.  So I gave her my yummy Arrachera (which in our opinion, is a real ""Churrasco"" by Puerto Rican standards) and I ate her Churrasco.  The Churrasco was just okay, nothing special.

I had the tenderloin as my main meal, and I sincerely could have licked the plate clean of its goat-cheesy side.  The meat was delicious as well, and the accompaniments (spicy beet salsa?  YES PLEASE!) were perfect too.  Simply delicious.  Everyone else loved their dishes; I would recommend dinner here, absolutely.",0.9967,0.619,0.343,0.039,0.656625258799172

What (to me) looked like an average-size restaurant was actually quite huge, and chock full o' color and personality. We were in town visiting some friends, and they suggested Carnivale for dinner. Added bonus: they had a little coupon or gift card (several, actually) for $10 off the total bill.  I was afraid it would get crowded so we made reservations through Open Table, but we got there before the big dinner rush anyways so it was all good. We were seated in an upper balcony area that overlooked the main dining area, which was pretty cool. (And seriously - color EVERYWHERE. Beautiful!) We started with some chips and guacamole. The guac was pretty good, but didn't quite stand up to Frontera's guac which we had just tried at lunch the day before. The chips were a little thicker than most but still nice and crumbly/crunchy. Mojitos were delish - I just wish they were about twice the size!  I settled on a skirt steak special with mashed potatoes (and possibly something else that I can't remember) and was absolutely blown away. I don't often clear my plate when I eat out, but I was practically chomping on the dish after this meal. Everyone was happy with their meals, and despite most of us clearing our plates and declaring ourselves stuffed...we still found room for the churros. (Seriously - how can you not?!) My only complaint would be that the bus boy took the sauces away after we finished the churros, even though we were all just licking it off our fingers instead.

The bar: Not as stocked as anticipated and missing a few of what I would consider standards in a bar of that size.. they ran out of DiSorrono and there was no Tuacca. Whatev... I was able to do two fingers Crown and two fingers Cointreau over with two squishes of lime. and it was all I needed Guac was tasty as anything, keeping a wonderful texture without being too firm and without being sorta slimy. also was favored just perfectly.  Rosemary Manchego is a personal favorite. Nutty and a semi hard cheese, the sheep's milk cheese is amazing to the palette and thoughtful to the tummy. Never hurts to order more that way others can say, ""Oh I can't possibly"" and you can say, ""O GOOD!"" Camarones al Ajillo was a decent serving. I think I got about 6 very good size shrimp that were cooked just before going over the edge to rubbery. The flavors were amazing and popped out and made me very happy.  The garbanzo puree was chunk full of garlic which made memorable moments more memorable when I got back to the hotel room, but it was worth it really.  Ceviche Tasting was down the table, and not too many in our group are into seafood, and even less trusted this Ceviche voodoo food here. That was lovely for me. I divvied up a bunch and was happy as a clam.. (No, I don't think there were any clams) Fried sweet plantains were quite nice, but I was expecting maybe a little firmer.  Still very tasty, they seemed they were steamed. I used them as the chips for my hummus. Macaroni and cheese, Prairie Pure cheddar, smoked bacon -  For MAcaroni goes, this is pretty good. This makes an excellent side, and maybe two bites will leave you satiated.  Bistek Palomilla - I got to share the rest of my friend's steak and was delighted at how nicely it was done. Rare, delicious and superbly cooked medium rare with a fabulous just spicy enough dry rub..  Dessert was brownies and ice cream, I believe a dolce de leche and was very filling after a few spoons of ice cream, and I skipped the brownies that did looked sincerely faboo.  Since our table was so big, we had two awesome wait staff working for us. Aside of that, everything went off without a hitch.

I had the $24 Chuleta pork chop - when it arrived, it looked dry and possibly overdone on the outside, but it was tender and juicy and one of the best pork chops I've ever had (in the top five?).  Wife had the seafood paella dish  (Mama's something) - nice, flavorful and as expected for $27 - with lots of seafood in it.  Daughter had the $19 grilled skirt steak - nicely done, great value, and you could smell the nice right-off-the grill burnt steak flavor pervade the table.  We finished with blueberry tres leches and churros (much fresher than at the ballpark!).  I don't know if I've ever had tres leches, but that cake is surprisingly densely packed with milky richness and I found it actually a challenge to finish my share (I didn't fess this to anyone at the time).   Overall, a memorable dinner in a memorable place.  Everywhere you go, including the wash rooms, there is color and vibrancy.  If you're looking for good food and something a little different, go here.  We also found free street parking nearby, and there's also nearby metered parking, as well as $5 valet parking.",0.9983,0.783,0.213,0.004,0.612012987012987

2010-04-26,4.0,"Before ever stepping foot in Carnivale, I was very skeptical about the place considering its dinner prices. First let me set up the scene: I was there with a group of 14+ friends for a birthday dinner. We first talked in the large lobby/bar area as we finished off a few drinks. The beers were a bit pricey, but the bartender was very nice and there was plenty of room in the area to mingle. Next, we were all seated at one large table. We were first told that they would not be able to accommodate our request of one table for the entire party, but they made it happen, so that was a pleasant surprise. Appetizers were eventually ordered and served. Personally, I only had the guacamole. I'm not a huge guac fan, but it was good... not sure if it was worth the $13 we ended up paying for it though. Finally, we we got to the dinner. I originally didn't want to pay all that much, but some how I ended up ordering one of the most expensive dishes on the menu (apparently I have no self-control - the steaks were just too tempting). I choose the Churrasco - a Nicaraguan style wood grilled beef tenderloin topped with chimichurri and a beet salsa all atop a goat cheese puree. At $32, I had high hopes for this dish... and it exceeded them. My plate was completely clean by the time our waitress removed it from the table. Everything on that plate was delicious.

The decor inside is super festive, totally living up to the name Carnivale.  However, that is pretty much where the festivities end.   FYI they will not seat your party until the whole party is there, which is understandable.  There is a huge bar and lounge in the waiting area which makes for a good time while waiting for stragglers. I ordered a raspberry mojito, which was not too bad. Once our party arrived we were seated at a huge table towards the back of the main dining room.  It was nice not to be crammed into a tight spot, but the boardroom-like table was so huge and the room was a bit loud that it made for difficulty holding conversation across the table.  The service was not the greatest - our server stood at one end of the table while she seemingly whispered the specials, and didn't seem to care if the other end didn't hear her. They have 5 kinds of ceviche, 3 of which I tasted and found pretty good. For my entree I had the ahi tuna - the server recommended to me to have it seared rare, which I agreed to, but the tuna came back almost cooked through.

In the bar area/waiting room, me and the bestie had some drinks and appetizers.  Wow, the drinks...They were so good, but I am a little biased towards capirinhas, as they are my ultimate favorite.  Had a nice amount of cachaca, as it was not watered down.  Made you wanting a second, and then a third...For appetizers, we had the ropa vieja.  Served as small sliders, don't be deceived, they are pretty addicting.  Meat was tender, and not sopping with the sauce.  Bread was nice and soft.  When our table was ready, we were escorted to the large room.  From outside, you would never guess how large the inside dining area was.  The ceilings are very tall, and there was a decent amount of room between tables to not feel overcrowded.  I had the Arrachera, which is their skirt steak.  It's pretty good, but I prefer the skirt steak from Café Bolero, which is about a third of the price less.  The chimichurri sauce wasn't runny, and thick enough to cover the steak perfectly.  The bestie had the Bife Angosto, which I had a taste of. For double the price of the Arrachera, you would think that it would be outstanding. Not so, it was pretty plain, had an okay amount of flavor, but not worth the $38!!!!  In addition, the truffle potatoes were just as plain tasting as the meat.  Boo In summary, my primary reason why I go to places in hopes of finding great cuisine.

Did we open the menu? Nyet: we were not going to validate pan-latino restaurants that take the banal American restaurant protein staples (e.g., tuna, chicken breast) and put some mango or some mojo on top. We were, however, going to have some charcuterie. And we did: jamon iberico para dos. And some Mount Enebro, aged manchego, and garroxta cheeses to boot. So that's not testing any actual cooked dish, and the restaurant didn't earn this ranking at all; we managed, nonetheless. I'll hand it to Chef Mendez: he does a good job sourcing his ingredients. The ham: silky in texture, almost grassy in taste. The cheeses: a textbook manchego, a nice creamy goat, and a harder goat (the Enebro) that was particularly elegant--and beautiful with some ham, quince jam, and cracker. The accoutrements featured some really nice and garlicky olives and some addictive marcona almonds. Yelp doesn't have an rating system for fellow customers, and I'm fine with demurring about the scene: not everyone understands or appreciates food--that's why there are restaurants like this.

The energy was great, and the space and atmosphere was awesome.  4 stars for decor and ambiance.  We hit the bar before we were seated, and really enjoyed said live music and their bar.

Both good drinks, but 2 drinks for 23 bucks.. 3.5 stars on the bar area... a bit pricey, but that's what your here for.. so expect paying that kind of price.  Let me take the time now to rate the service. 5 Stars... it was awesome. Our server, whom I wished I got his name, was awesome. Despite a crowded room, he was very pleasant, never rushed us, gave us recommendations off the Pre Fixe menu, cleaned our table, and refilled the water and replaced silverware with impeccable timing and grace, and definitely spaced out the food pacing perfectly.  That guy was on his game.. almost ninja-like, and it made our experience so much better. He deserved his generous tip, because that was some awesome service.  The first course consisted of a salad with apples, walnuts, blue cheese and it was pretty good. The black bean soup was good too. 3 stars there, solid.. but nothing amazing. It is the first course after all.  We ordered off the pre fixe and got a trio of ceviche's. the Mixto, Tuna, and the Scallop ceviche. It was recommended by our server, and man was that some good ceviche. 4 stars, tasty, bright, packing a bit of heat to play off the citrus notes.  Our main course selections were the lomo saltado, and the fish, I think it was char. Really good dishes both of them... great tasty takes on the dishes. Nice presentation, balance of flavor, and it made us full, but not overstuffed. So good portioning. 4 stars.  For dessert, they ran out of the bread pudding.. so we ended up with chocolate flan, and some brownies with coconut ice cream. Really good, although I preferred the brownie's over the flan.

Service is strong, and although we dined at 5:30 pm on a weeknight, we were well surrounded by other ""early"" diners.  Clearly this is a place that fills up later, especially with their wonderful wine list, outstanding mixology offerings that favor festive latin beverages, and weekly salsa dancing.

Just the name ""Carnivale"" makes me think of meat and meat galore, that which rivals the likes of Fogo de Chao. Unfortunately, it's not. Got my hopes up for nothing. Carnivale is hard for me to put a finger on, but it's supposed to be some kind of latin restaurant with dishes from Central America and South America. As you walk in, it looks like a typical entrance to a semi-expensive restaurant. Dark, a bit smokey, and a bar teaming with life. Finding the bathroom was an excursion in itself. Once your table is ready, you walk through the curtain to a huge...room. Anticlimatic? So was the ""room."" It looks like they put tables on top of a huge ballroom with extremely high ceilings. Towards the top of the wall, you see a gigantic assortment of wine all neatly stacked in a rack. In the middle there's a stairway that leads to a second floor which, I recall, were mainly booths. Here's where atmosphere comes in. It was LOUD! Maybe it's the high ceilings, maybe it's the hard floor, perhaps it was the hundreds of people screaming to talk above everyone else. It was a very unpleasant noise. We were lucky enough to be inside a little alcove so it blocked out most of the sound from the ""ballroom"", but it was loud enough that I had to scream to talk to people just across the table. In addition to the noise, as long as we're talking about atmosphere, it was hard to imagine the place being latin at all, save the music. Nothing about the decor or setup resembled anything latin, unless photographs of buttcracks are supposed to describe the culture, which I highly doubt. Ok, so the atmosphere ain't all that, fine, as long as the food's good, I'll be happy. Inside the menu, there was a single sheet of paper listing their...ahem...""amazing"" variety. There really wasn't anything interesting in it that made you want to really order it. There's really just some categories (Salad, Seafood, and Meat), and the choices in those categories don't really stick out as being different from each other. I had a very hard time trying to pick a meal, because nothing seemed all that appetizing. The only thing I could imagine being decent (or at least different) was the Borrego, lamb T-Bone. My Borrego came out ok. Since there were so many ""pieces"" to my meal, it's pretty impressive that they got it to come out as neat as they did. I saw the Mama Mendez 'Arros Con Mariscos', which is like a rice covered with seafood and sauce dish, and it looked really bad. Think of even the cheapest Chinese restaurants, the kind you used to get at college. This almost looked like someone had just spent a few minutes eating it before returning it to the kitchen to tell them it's not their dish...then it appears in front of you. The pollo that I saw come out was rather unpleasant, because it was literally just a dead chicken on a plate. There's nothing neat, eccentric, or even funny about the dish other than it's a dead chicken. Presentation was really all over the board. Some were neat, some were not, nothing too consistant. Now the food! My Borrego...Texture was good, and it had a lot of garlic on it, which is a huge plus to me. The downside was that it was incredibly salty! It's the kind of salty that actually irritates your lips a bit. With enough water, it went down, and despite being overly salty, my plate was actually fairly satisfying. The Pollo is definitely something you need to avoid like the plague. The chicken here is so dry, and no frills, and no enjoyment, and certainly no satisfaction. The steaks didn't really deserve any kind of honerable mention. The rest of the menu that I did try was rather...bleh. The portions left you full though. The service was pretty average, or maybe just slightly above, because I don't think I was ever left needing anything, but they didn't do too much more than that. There was nothing spectacular about how they brought the food or how they offered to bring or refil your drinks. Finally the price. My Borrego (did I mention that it made me full?) was only $25. With the property, the decorations (though not the best), the staff, and the hyped up name in mind, $25 is not a bad price to pay at all for what I got. $14 for the dead chicken...that's reasonable. I'd say that your average is around the low to mid $20's, and I think that's very reasonable for a place like this. There's really nothing that impressed me enough to make me want to go back.",0.9857,0.775,0.132,0.093,0.5359089191232048

We wish we could have had dinner there but we did not have the time. The space was pretty spectacular. The music was nice but since we were looking to have a conversation it made it a bit difficult to do so. No offense to the singer...she was great but we probably should have sat at the back bar.

(02)  They can add almost any of these ""tropical"" juices to a drink.  My favorite drink isn't even on the menu.  I always order the Passion Fruit Caipirinha....but I must warn you - it's made from real passion fruit so it will burn your mouth if you order more than two! (03)  They run this awesome gift card promotion towards the end of the year - usually starting Thanksgiving to New Years.  Spend $100 on a gift card and get another $50 GC for free. Here's the kicker - and I am not going to spell it out for you - but know that you can use the gift cards for the same meal you are dining in on.  Figure it out and you will realize there is a deal to be made here. (04)  If you take one of their ""Margarita"" or ""Mojito"" classes it is good to invite your team from work or boss.  I have bonded with my managers many times over a freshly made drink.  Education at its best!  Call them for details. (05) Try the fish tacos, Ceviche Tasting (almost as good as what I usually get in Key West), and Carne Aguayon.....they are worth the high price tag....I promise! Well...that's it for now.  If you hear any other deals let me know - but get out and try it already....SERIOUSLY!",0.9984,0.775,0.214,0.011,0.4686715997181114

For the meal, I tried the often-reviewed braised short rib and just thought it was just above okay. I did like the potatoes it was served on a lot. My wife ordered the ahi tuna, but the waitress put the order in wrong and brought the special of the day which was a ton of seafood on a dish. She loved it! For dessert we got the churros.

We know you guys are busy but just give us a sign that you see us and we'll feel better waiting!  2. Reservation process. When I called I was informed you can only reserve 5:30 or 9:30 pm. Weird but fine we make one for 9:30. We arrive an hour earlier to get some drinks at the lounge, wasn't a really nice experience (read #1 above) but patiently waited 30 minutes before approaching hostess to ask about our reservation. She asked us to come back if whole party was there. Went back after 15 minutes and she gave us this thing that vibrates once your table is available, she said we'll be seated near the time we reserved. Come 9:30 the thing still wasn't vibrating so approached the desk and they said to wait for a few more minutes because people were just leaving. 9:45 and the thing was still dead, I was losing my patience but approached the desk as calm as possible, the girl gave me the same answer as before. WTF, how hard was it to prepare the tables?The worse part about all this was the girl wasn't very nice, she didn't sound like she's doing everything she could to get us our table! All lip service! I don't know why we even stayed and waited...I guess we were too hungry...too cold and too lazy since we've waited a long time anyways. But whats the point of getting a reservation if you can't get a table at the agreed time??? The thing finally buzzed at 10 pm, 30 minutes past our reservation. The weird thing in all this was, people were being ushered in all the time while we stood there waiting, what time did they reserve 5:30?  3. The food was ok but not worth all the sh*t we had to go through. Was so hungry by the time we were seated that even McDonalds sounded good. I can't believe I paid what I paid just to be treated that way. I don't care how much people love this place. I can get better food and service elsewhere.

The menu is an eclectic mix of Latin American cuisine - you can see Venezuelan, Mexican, Puerto Rican, and many others. Although it seems that everything is good on the menu, my personal favorites are the Ropa Vieja appetizer and the Arrachera (skirt steak) dinner. They also have a wide variety of mixed drinks, including mojitos, sangria, margaritas and daiquiris. There is also a very large selection of (sometimes expensive) wines to choose from. I really love the atmosphere of the large main room - if you make a reservation, you should specify that you want to sit out there. It's a little louder, but that is where to sit if you want to feel like you're in the action. I won't go into too much detail since it seems that there are plenty of others who have already done that for me. I went with 4 stars for the atmosphere, food, and service. The high price (can run close to $100 per couple, not including any expensive wines) and limited beer selection kept me from giving it a 5 star rating - but I'm sure I'll be back again on a special occasion.",0.9583,0.874,0.115,0.011,0.39618357487922706

My husband thought the decor was cheesy, but I liked the loud colors for a change. We were totally impressed to see so many of the Spanish wines on the wine list that we enjoyed so much while on our vacation in Spain. While we didn't order a glass of wine, he ordered Estrella Damm and I had the Cairpirinha--a cross between a mojito and a margarita. A dry rum from Brazil...  And boy was it good.  Oh the Manchego! We ordered this cheese with drinks and were very happy we did. Ever so tangy and satisfying. I found it interesting that it was served with blueberry jam--but what a perfect flavor combination it was.     For dinner, we ordered the Costilla De Res (braised short ribs) and the Churrasco (beef tenderloin), and we were very happy we did! We each shared a bite with one another and decided we weren't willing to share more than that. My Churrasco was prepared with goat cheese mashed potatoes and drizzled with a green arugula sauce and pickled beet salsa. Those flavors totally worked it!  For dessert, Flan.

Wrapped it up with blueberry tres leches and espresso infused sippin' tequila.  The tres leches was excellent, but the tequila tasted like kahlua, so i was kind of disappointed.  Not bad, but not the tequila fueled adventure I was looking for. The valet situation was utter anarchy.  It is only $5 but there were tons of people waiting on their vehics.  I don't know that it's representative.  Had more of the feel that someone (or someones) didn't show up for work.  Regardless valet demand far outstripped valet supply.

So, the first thing they did was apologize for the wait and comped us an appetizer.  It was tasty, though I remember feeling as though they should have done more.  Anyway, there were five of us at dinner, and we just ordered a bunch of food and shared it all family style.  Although I got shafted on ordering anything I personally wanted, I found most of the dishes quite tasty.  Some, however, were inedible past 2 bites due to sodium levels (I wasn't under strict restriction at that point, but I was watching it pretty carefully anyway).  The drinks were apparently good, and the non-alcoholics (Mojito Smoothie) were really nice - something I appreciate greatly.

All that was left was bone after I was done with it. I mean, had I been less than a lady I might have licked the plate. It WAS bangin, but. . . . . I honestly didn't feel it was $27 bangin.

My steak was perfectly prepared as well. The drinks were interesting, if slightly girly. I loved the Caparinia though, and it is very hard to get a good one in this city. Each element was well paired and surprising -- a great meal all in all.  The service left something to be desired, as in many Jerry Kleiner places. Snobby, aloof and unavailable (if seriously hot) are the words I would use to describe our waiter.

2009-10-12,5.0,"This is our friend's favorite place and our one ""nice"" place on our list during a recent visit to Chicago. We started with drink at the bar and I sampled the mojito, which was traditional without the icky flavored syrup that so many places had adopted  It was delicious, but I then settled on the mango mojito, which was fabulous.  Once entering the dining room, I was amazed by how colorful and beautiful it was. We started with an order of guacamole, which was prepared to order and served with homemade chips. The chips were double layered and greasy, but delicious. The guac was out of this world!! The menu had a lot of great options but I went with the special, which featured black bass with yellow curry on mashed maple sweet potatoes and topped with shrimp and corn salsa. Wow.... the flavors and textures worked together beautifully. It was really amazing. The men each ordered the skirt steak with rice and beans and topped with chimichurri and onions. Another flavorful and amazing dish. I also sampled the pernil, which was a little dry but very tasty.  We ordered broccoli with cheese and almonds and mac and cheese. The broccoli was very good, but not really complimenting any of the dishes and the mac and cheese was fairly boring. No dessert, as we were pretty full from the meal and the drinks.  I have to comment on the service. I am a big advocate of service recovery. Working in the industry for many years, I have come to understand that things happen. It's not the issue, but how the restaurant handles issues that stands out in my mind. When first sitting down at the table, we sat for at least 10 minutes without being acknowledged. Not a huge issue, as we had our drinks from the bar, but we were definitely in need of a drink refresh and ready to order by the time the server came over to greet us and tell of the specials. He immediately acknowledged and apologized for the oversight and we weren't bothered and let it go. He was knowledgeable and helped with some menu selections.  Once he had left, the manager came over with the guacamole, which we had ordered, and also apologized for the oversight and offered our appetizer complimentary. Our service was top notch, while remaining unobtrusive, for the rest of the evening and our meal flowed comfortably. We were all very pleased.",0.9983,0.771,0.209,0.02,0.6152787006275379

Good thing they have good drinks! We had a cheese tasting platter, very good accept one of the cheese was not one that we ordered.  We didn't want to make a big deal about it, so we tried it anyways.  We shared 2 appetizers.  Their portions are really quite large and perfect for sharing.  Hands down favorite is the Ropa Vieja.  SO good.

Once you step inside the main dining area, you cannot help but look up & all around at more funkiness in decor.  The food does not disappoint either.

Once seated, a few members of our party ordered the drink which was on special, which was the Caipirinha. When the drink arrived, it was PACKED with ice, so much so, that it was almost impossible to stir, and was nearly finished with two sips!  I will say that the drink was tasty though. . . it was a pretty much an limeade cocktail! I love limes, so this was plus for me.   As an appetizer, we ordered the Ceviche Tasting of 3, and the Shrimp was definitely the most flavorful! As the main course, I ordered the Pollo Estilo Billy... which is a chicken breast rubbed with spices. I must say it was some of the most flavorful chicken I have ever had. But, the side for this dish was papas fritas (french fries), which were somewhat disappointing, very blah.  I did get to taste the rice and beans that came with the Arrachera, and they were delicious!  For dessert, the Tres Leches was ordered. I must say it was disappointing. Not only was it not very flavorful, but it also came topped with blueberry sauce (not a fan) and with this strange basil-cream sauce on the side. I must say it was also the driest tres leches I have ever had. On the upside, the ice cream dessert I tasted was very good.  Overall, I like this place, because I believe it has potential.

The semi-private room was nice because the curtains let you see the rest of the room and keep it from feeling close, while it still feels as though you are in a more intimate setting. We presented the service staff with a challenge that they seem adroit in handling: a broad range of arrival times. Three or four people arrived first around 5:30, I got there a little after 6:00, another joined at nearly 7:00 and the eighth (who was arriving from the airport and was not expected given the need for last-minute travel) arrived sometime between 7:00 and 8:00. The staff was attentive the whole time, bringing fresh hors d'oeuvre happily around and never making us feel hurried.

2009-08-25,4.0,"Ironically the last time that I went to Carnivale was 3 years ago for St. Patrick's day. I went with a large group and was more concerned about drinking that I did not focus too much on the food, and honestly can't recall what I ate, but just the many vodka on the rocks that I had.  The one thing that did make a very strong impression on me was the ambiance of the place.  This coming year my students want to have either their Senior Luncheon or Prom there so I had to go ahead and check it out, and thus I decided to make a meal out of it. I didn't realize it, but you can actually eat outside during the summertime. I would loved to have sat out there, but I obviously had to sit inside so I get a better gage on the place for potentially 650 people.  The inside is so colorful and lively though -- I love it. As my friend even said, ""This would be a great place to come during the winter; it would really cheer you up!""   We started off with drinks, and my friend got the ginger mojito that came highly recommended.  I didn't even realize there was such a thing as ginger liquer.  I do not like mojitos, but I did try a bit of his and I will admit it was quite tasty.  I am a HUGE lover of the cheese so I had to get a cheese plate. I initially was going to get the 5 cheeses for the two of us, but I'm so glad I didn't because they do NOT skimp.  I basically told our waiter (who was a really cordial guy and was very good at giving suggestions) to just choose whichever 3 he thought were ""best"" because I'd eat anything.  We got Pleasant Ridge Reserve which was VERY much like a cheddar, and then another one that was like a blue cheese that tasted absolutely divine with the raspberry jelly that came with the plate, and another cheese that tasted like a parmesan (as my friend described it) and had some herbs on the rine that were delicious.  I was in love! In the midst of attempting to decide what we wanted the waiter made some remark about how there was this special at one time that was a salmon tar tar, and how he actually saw it on another customer's plate, so the chef might be willing to make it for us even though it was not on tonight's menu.  I was like:  if he'll make it, I'll eat it. So the waiter said he'd see what he could do.  Surely enough the chef was willing to make it, which as the waiter said, is generally extremely odd, most chefs won't go out of their way to do that.  It was absolutely delicious.  If you don't like raw fish (as my friend is not the largest fan of it) you couldn't even really tell with this.  It was in like a custard-y (sorry, do NOT know how else to describe it) gel that was the color of the salmon that tasted a bit like mayo and something else.  Then it was covered with radishes and aoli (sp?) on the side.  Absolutely fantastic. My friend got a salmon dish that was recommended by our waiter for his entree. I'm not a meat eater but the Churrasco also came HIGHLY recommended, and the table next to us exclaimed how absolutely delicious it was.  I wanted to do smaller plates rather than get an entree because I was full from my cheese, and I couldn't even finish what I got.  I got the soup of the day which was this mushroom puree -- I have NEVER tried a soup so delicious.  I could eat bowls and bowls of that.  If you like mushrooms, you would LOVE this.  It was a bit grainy and then there was something white they stuck in there which I felt like was like a mozzarella cheese, but I'm not sure -- it was just REALLY good. Then I also go a taste dish of the ceviche.  I felt bad, they were delicious and I tried everyone, but I could NOT finish that because I was already so ridiculously full and was loving my soup so much.  Again in regards to the ceviche I just told the waiter to bring me the three best.  I'm pretty sure I had the Kampachio (sp?), but I can't be for certain what the other two were. This is the problem with telling them to bring you whatever, you don't always know for sure what you are eating. The table next to us got their side mac n' cheese dish which looked absolutely fantastic, and I know when I went with my cousins they raved about the empanadas.  I would have KILLED to have been able to have dessert, but I couldn't even finish my dinner.  I'll be anxious to see how this goes over with the high schoolers as they aren't too used to eating much beyond pizza and Big Macs, but I would totally recommend this place to anyone, it is just fabulous in every way.

Ambiance was fun , vibrant, loud. The walls are covered in bright colors that makes it feel very warm. We didn't have to wait very long for our table since we had a reservation. Now the important part - the food. We started with guacomole, braised short ribs, and ceviche as starters. The guacomole was simple and had a very strong lime flavor to it. I enjoyed it because I love lime but people at the table did not enjoy it too much so beware if you're not a lime fan. Braised short ribs were sweet and melted in your mouth (as they should). We had fish ceviche and it was okay... it's what I would expect from ceviche. Entrees - my fiance had the beef tenderloin with goat cheese puree as it came highly recommended from the waiter. It was cooked perfectly (rare) but the flavors were not a fun party in my mouth. I was not a big fan of the spicy beet salsa or the arugula chimichurri. The flavors were overpowering for me. I had the wood grilled porkchop which was pretty good.. but not a fan of the bacon-plantain fufu. But thats okay, it saved me calories (because I totally was watching my calorie count with the 5,000 calories I ate that evening)! Dessert - both couples ordered their special sorbet for the night. It came in a trio of plum, peach, and raspberry. Raspberry was our fave by far. The other 2 were okay but the raspberry was the most refreshing. On a side note, we had to tune our waiter out because he reminded us of a used car salesman. He tried to push us to order everything... there was only 4 of us, not 14! And on top of that, he had no clue what he was talking about. He recommended the salmon and claimed that it was specific type of salmon (i dont remember which one) but that got my fiance VERY excited because he's had it once when it was in season in Seattle. He asked, ""Wow, how did you guys get those? Aren't they only in season in the spring? Where did you get them from?"" and the waiter looked a little taken back and said, ""Oh. It might not be that one, I can be wrong. We have a different fish of the day so I may be incorrect."" Uhm, don't they tell you what the fish of the day is specifically? I don't think it's that difficult.... I think it's fun to try once but I don't see myself as a regular  here.",0.9971,0.787,0.171,0.043,0.5557047466422466

The Mama Mendez -- Sofrito rice, shrimp, mussels, clams, squid, chorizo, peas, chicken, lobster broth round up the night's top dishes. I had the Pernil ($19), rum-glaced pork shoulder with olive rice and beans. Sadly, the pork shoulder was dry and I barely detected the rum glace, which has caramelized to the point of charred. But the pan-fried plantains as usual earned my good graces.  We also indulged in the Ropa Vieja appetizer -- five big offerings of braised beef shredded atop sweet plantains in spicy mayo, queso fresco. The best $9 ever spent on small mouthfuls of delight.

Once we were inside Carnivale, we saw that the massive sign fit right into the atmosphere and ambiance. Everything is colorful and right from the start puts you in a GREAT mood. We went to the bar and got drinks while we waited for the table and the sangria was delicious, you can never go wrong with a good glass of sangria at a place like this.  After we were seated and had looked over the menu we decided on ordering the guacamole as an appetizer and boy were we right! The guacamole and chips are to die for. It was probably the freshest guac I have ever tasted. After having such a good appetizer we were afraid we were going to be let down by the meal but thankfully we were wrong. The Arrachera (grilled skirt steak with rice, beans, sweet red onion and a chimichurri) was unbelievable. I had been told to order this dish ahead of time since I am such a fan of skirt steak and in no way was I disappointed. If anything I am saddened that no other skirt steak may live up to Carnivale's preparation of it. When cooked correctly, skirt steak is an amazing piece of meat.  Unfortunately we were way to full to have dessert which from the looks of other table was really good. That just means next time I go I will have to save room.  The service was great, in no way did we feel rush or forgotten about, it was perfect. The only criticism that I have about the wait staff is their ties.

(sung to the tune of O Christmas tree) This is my new favorite place to dine at the moment; even though it's not new, and I've been there several times. It was, however, my first time in the dining area. Perhaps that's what  rekindled my love?  Let's start with the decor, shall we? I love the large spacious dining area. My kinda style with bold colors and whimsical fixtures with warm lighting. Color makey me happy! Very sophisticated vibe sans the snobbery.   The music is always on jam. I don't know why I haven't made it there for Salsa night yet. What am I waiting for? The food? OMG, the food! My favorite is the ropa vieja appetizer. I couldn't tell you what all is in it (steak and plaintains I know, for sure), but man, is it good! This weekend I traipsed away from my usual and tried some different items. T'was by far, the best meal that I've had in a while. Their raspberry mojito: the good kind of memorable. I'm a sucker for truffle fries so that was a treat. Let me say this: I've always been indifferent about asparagus. Think it tastes like a cross between grass and something good for you. No mas! The asparagus was unlike any I've ever tasted. The flavors of the seasoning mixed with the cheese on top? Que bueno! Lastly, the steak that I had was out of this world. Please sir, may I have s'more?   The crowd is a nice mix of yuppy and mature. I like that you can throw on  a cocktail dress and not feel out of place. The only drawback is that everytime I've been, there's ALWAYS a wait so we usually end up eating in the lounge area which tends to be extremely loud so you're yelling your conversation the entire time.  Other than that, I think Carnivale is a cut above the rest of some of the other popular restaurants serving up  Latin cuisine.",0.9941,0.783,0.179,0.038,0.5858101925175097

I ordered the Cadillac Margarita based on the waiter's recommendation - I asked for the strongest, smoothest, least sweet marg on the menu - and it was FAB.  I had 2 and I was a happy camper!  Two of my girlfriends had the Carnivale Martini (with pom juice) which they loved but I thought was way too sweet, although potent as well.  I don't mind paying $10 for a drink if it has a good amount of alcohol in it (hard to find in this city)!!

For starters, my date and I shared some guacamole. Easily some of the best I have ever tasted. Very fresh and creamy. Along with that, we ordered camarones al ajillo, which was four jumbo shrimp on top of a garbanzo puree with garlic. If you don't like garlic, don't order it...our breath smelled garlicky all night! My date decided to introduce me to cerviches, which I personally didn't care for.  For dinner, I chose the Quinotto. Wow, if I wasn't so full from the appetizers, I would have polished this off! A very generous portion of quinoa, packed and served in a circular disc-like shape. Inside, it contained snow peas, asparagus, pine nuts and raisins. On top was some sort of greenery, which I think was arugula. On top of that was some bits of goat cheese and capers. The goat cheese lended a nice creamy mouth-feel to the rest of the dish. Drizzled on the side of the plate is a aji panca mushroom sauce. Cute, but not enough flavor for me. Now, the downer. Upon choosing this restaurant for my 21st birthday (Yay!) I was mostly excited to see they served plantains. When I attempted to order a side of them, our server informed me that they were OUT of plantains. WHAT?? I was SO disappointed! How do you run out of a staple like that? Not only is it a side, but it is served with the Ropa Vieja dish! Our server suggested we try Tostones instead, which was slices of under-ripe bananas fried, served with a garlic sauce. Blegh. No flavor at all. The service was great. Our server definitely had a great personality and described the dishes very well. However, my date miscalculated the tip  (20 on a 140 check) and left less than usual, and our server was very short when saying goodbye to us. That rubbed me the wrong way.

Camarones al Ajillo (Shrimp) - Technically its an appetizer, but we ordered it as an entree.  There was nothing special about this dish, it was a fairly standard grilled shrimp with garlic dish.

It's a converted warehouse (former fish market) that is quite gaudy (walls painted in bright colored stripes; humongous lampshades in brightly colored stripes and polka dots). The service is professional, friendly and very attentive. The food was pretty good. I had the guacamole, which I thought would be amazing from yelpers, but it was OK, needed more kick (lime, garlic?); the best part were the chips, which were thick but light. I had the 3-item ceviche which was beautifully presented and delicious, generous serving. The macaroni and cheese was somewhat misleading; it was more like alfredo (rigatoni with rich cream sauce and breadcrumbs; no gooey cheese). And it's very loud (high volume recorded latin music in dining area, and adjacent you could here the competing music from the saxophone/trumpet/trombone/congo drums amplified music). Acoustics are really bad. It's all just very busy (think Circus Circus with a Steve Wynn touch, sorta Cirque du Soleil without the Quebecois touch). My meal was $40, so it was reasonable, I thought. Oh yeah, it sorta bothered me that the waitresses wore all-black button-down dress shirts, ties, slacks and shoes, but when you walk in the men's room the walls are plastered with women baring breasts (yes, the nipples are shown). It sorta creeped me out. I know, they're trying for the Carnivale thing, but the heavy-effort theming didn't all quite work. Honestly, it is too loud (acoustically and visually) to really enjoy the food and fine service. And it doesn't feel particularly Latin. I just wish the surrounding were toned down a bit so the food could take center stage. P.S.

I guess we didn't look cool enough. Service was solid. Mojito's were good but weak. Caipirihna was way better. We started with the ropa vieja app which was fantastic and huge. And the trio of ceviches(shrimp, tuna, kona) and loved it. Moving on, the Churassco was cooked to perfection and had a great smokey flavor. I had the Ono special which had very little Latin flair to it aside from the olives in an attempt at vera cruz style. Anyway it was a very nice piece of fish.

Last time I was there I had an awesome pozole to start and a great steak dish with yucca, topped off by a couple very reasonably priced cocktails. I do think the mojitos are way overrated. In their defense it is freaking tough to turn out that many mojitos in the single night. Still....go with the Capirinha if you want rum or really any of their tequila cocktails. Great food topped off by very attentive, some times a little too attentive, service. Still, a real winner in my book.",0.9841,0.749,0.216,0.035,0.5984776334776334

Disliked: There are like almost NO vegetarian options.  I had to deconstruct things leaving them lacking- I wasn't in the mood for their only veg option- some quinoa dish.   The dining room is HUGE and bright-Yuck!  Like they forgot to dim the lighting- and it was after 9pm!  I felt like I was in a banquet hall. Drinks are pricey and on the weak side- if your gonna make fancy drinks, please don't piss us off and not even make them strong!

We went on a Friday evening, and the bar was quite full with trendy, attractive looking urban professionals. They were having fun, but the mood wasn't racous. As far as dress code...I saw a lot of jeans and sandals, but no t-shirts. Khakis and a dress shirt works fine, and go even dressier if you care to, it would work just great for a date.  OK, the food: My wife is from Nicaragua, so she knows latin food, and she is a credible and authoritative judge of Latin cuisine, and her bottom line was ""It's good, but it doesn't blow me away."" We started with the Ropa Vieja (""Old Clothes"") Sweet plantains, braised beef, spicy mayo, and queso fresco. I thought these were quite good, and I thought for an appetiser, the portion was generous and was a good value. My wife thought they were just ok. By the way, she ordered a Sangria, which I tasted and I thought it was pretty darn good. I could easily have a pitcher of those on a Summer afternoon. Entrees: She had the Costilla De Res (Braised short rib, mash potatoes, corn and peanut salsa). Again, she thought it was just ok. Not bad, but not great either. I took a taste and I thought it was a little on the sweet side for my liking. I had the Churrasco (Nicaraguan style wood-grilled beef tenderloin, malanga goat cheese puree, arugula chimichurri, spicy beet salsa). My wife (remember, she is from Managua, Nicaragua) said ""They don't serve steak that way in Nicaragua."" So, authentic, it probably wasn't. But taste wise, I enjoyed it. The steak was a nice cut of beef, very tender, although not cooked medium as ordered. It was more medium rare...however, it was tasty. Less so was the 'arugula chimichurri', which was a bright green puree, and it tasted very 'green' and bitter. A traditional chimichurri would have been much more advisable. The goat cheese potatoes were interesting, but after a few bites, I felt they tasted a little too 'gamey'. The beet salsa was a nice accent, although little more than ten marinated diced beet cubes. Dinner for two, with one Sangria, one appetizer and two entrees came to 90.00. Over all, I enjoyed the experience; the space and ambiance makes up for the small deficiencies in the food.

2009-03-25,4.0,"Last Saturday was a plan B kind of evening.  So when my original idea for post roller derby dinner didn't pan out, we decided to give Carnivale a try.  Thank goodness for iPhone, because a couple of taps and we had a 9:30pm res. I'd been to Carnivale before, but it was NYE so it was a bit different...or so I thought.  We walked in to a crowd that was dressed to the nines.  I mean, like taffeta cocktail dresses everywhere.  It was interesting.  I remember cocktail attire last time, but it was NYE!  A little confused, we headed over to the host stand and were told it would be a bit of a wait.  I'm starting to think that is Carnivale's MO, make people wait so they buy some cocktails.  It seems to happen every time, even with a reservation. When we were seated, we got a beautiful table right next to the kitchen.  But hey, I got a little curtain next to my seat so I didn't see the comings and goings.  After our server paid us a visit, I was bracing myself for a big disappointment.  He was pretty rude, correcting my friend's pronunciation and rushing us through our order.  I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, it was around 10, maybe it was a long night, but still not a great first impression.  Our server last time was so cool!  What happened? My friend's appetizer came out ahead of our drinks which was kind of irritating.  Drinks seemed to take forever, but they were tasty when they came.  I had the horchatatini and it was delicious.  Unfortunately it was one of those that went down a bit too fast. My four star rating is really for the food.  It was fabulous!  I had the short rib, which was enormous, and couldn't stop eating it.  The corn and peanut salsa that came with it was also surprisingly delicious.  My friends had the arrachera and the quinotto.  The arrachera was charred to perfection and the quinotto was very good too.  We completely cleaned our plates.  So good!

2009-03-24,2.0,"The premise: Work dinner for 6 on a Monday night I always know it's a bad sign when the server leads off with ""...has anyone not been here before?""  Unless this is a restaurant that actually does require directions - like Fogo de Chao or Zed451 - the server does not need to tell me how to dine. Inevitably, there's always someone at the table who is new to the restaurant, and so begins the long, drawn-out introduction speech about how to navigate the menu, what the server's 10 favorite menu items are, what his favorite drinks are, and so on.  I don't like being talked down to, especially when it comes to food.  I appreciate a knowledgeable server, but I don't need a slew of questions answered that I haven't even asked.  Don't assume that I don't know what ceviche is. Moving onwards, we finally got a chance to order drinks and a couple of ceviches to start off with (tuna and scallop).  Not only did the ceviches arrive before my first drink arrived, another pet peeve of mine, we were given the tuna ceviche and the shrimp ceviche (instead of the scallop ceviche we ordered).  I understand that mistakes happen and I would have pointed it out had I been with friends rather than co-workers, but it made me angry seeing as how I wasn't pleased with the service to begin with. Our drinks came out shortly afterwards.  I had a glass of Malbec (yum) and others at my table had various types of mojitos.  The mojitos were on special for $5 and everyone said that they were great.  The appetizers were pretty solid, but nothing special.  Here's the run-down: Shrimp Ceviche:  Not what we ordered, but still pretty good.  However, I've had better (at Ay Ay Picante, for example)  Tuna Tiradito Ceviche:  Delicious - great mix of textures with the jicama and the avocado, and a nice spice from the thin slice of Serrano pepper on each piece.   It was a little odd though that it came with five clear portions and was served to the six of us without warning.  Fortunately, one of us didn't like tuna.   Camarones al Ajillo:  Nice portion of jumbo grilled shrimp over a garlicky garbanzo puree.  When everyone was wondering what the puree underneath was, I probably shouldn't have told them it was really just a glorified hummus.  Still, no complaints.  Meat and Cheese of Spain:  Platter of Manchego cheese, jamón Serrano, mixed olives, and bread.  I didn't get a chance to try the cheese, the jamón was milder than I would have liked, and the olives were pretty good.  I think it was supposed to also come with some quince paste, but that was nowhere to be found.   Guacamole:  Good (but then again, how hard is it to make good guacamole?).  It came with nice homemade tortilla chips.   Next, we ordered our entrees.  I did appreciate that the server let us take our time with ordering and had nicely spaced out our appetizers.  I ordered the beef tenderloin, which came with a goat cheese puree, an arugula chimichurri, and a spicy beet salsa.  Overall, I was happy with the dish.  I ordered the beef medium-rare, but it was very much on the rare side.  I wasn't going to complain because I happen to like rare steak, but I think some people would have sent it back.  Both the chimichurri and the beet salsa were very good.  The goat cheese puree tasted more like very creamy mashed potatoes rather than goat cheese, but it was good nonetheless.   Other than the tenderloin, my coworkers ordered the spice-rubbed chicken breast, the New York strip, the grouper special, and the arroz con mariscos.  Everyone seemed content.   Finally, we ordered two desserts to share: the tres leches cake and the chocolate brownie.  I'm sad to say that I was disappointed by both.  As far as I know, tres leches cake is supposed to be extremely moist.  This one almost had a hard, crusty exterior and a not so moist interior.  It came with a cilantro ice cream, which I didn't love but I appreciated the originality.  The chocolate brownies looked and tasted like they came out of a Little Debbie package, and that's all I'm going to say about that.   This review may be a little bit harsh, but this place is so over-hyped that I felt I needed to be honest.  Last night was actually my second time there.  The first time was over a year ago; I don't remember specifics, but I know I ordered the tuna entrée and did not like it at all.  I've heard so many good things about this place since then that I tried to keep an open mind the second time.   To be fair, Carnivale does have great atmosphere and food to please a wide variety of tastes.  Nothing I ate was horrible - it just didn't live up to the hype.  I'd give it a 2 1/2 stars if I could, but not 3.

The food here is really great and the wine and drink list is vast, but I would like to see better service for the buck here.  And I HATE it when they make you wait for the rest of your party.  My parents were in traffic and were late and we had to stand at the bar for 20 minutes because they wouldn't seat us.  Come on people!  We would have happily ordered appetizers...heck, it took the waiter that long to remember to tell us the specials after we eventually sat down!",0.87,0.869,0.086,0.045,0.5871527777777779

The place has got to be 5 times larger than Park 52, but the decor is dead on Kleiner style.  Though you'd never know it in the bar area, the dining area has a soaring ceiling and can hold a heck of a lot of patrons. Wait staff is friendly, attentive, and eager to answer any and all questions.  Ceviche is excellent, guacomole is good, but I have a theory about guacomole......it's kind of like sex.....even bad guacomole is GOOD guacomole.  I had the skirt steak which was excellent.

They were slow with simple drink orders and seemed to have some attitude dealing with a large group. My previous experience was a table of two. Much better, but still not impressive service.

We were all in a festive mood...the room is loud but really very cool. I was a little disappointed to be seated by the kitchen when we had made our reservation well in advance but we weren't too crowded so again i decided not to sweat it.

We order apps-- he isnt too much into listening...more in to upselling.. apps come out super quickly and we take to eating....

I finally get up to go to the bathroom and on the way talk to a floor manager...even with that push i was able to go downstairs, go to the bathroom, and look around for a few min before our server got to us....and we didnt really see him much the rest of the night.  another floor manager came and comped our guac and gave my friend a b-day dessert but it proved to be too little too late and the the whole group lost our spunk.   Net:  Drinks: 5 stars (cava rita...i love you)  Food: 4 Stars (really good but not amazing or innovative)  Atmosphere: 4 stars (fun place!)

However, the food itself was quite good - I liked the homemade tortilla chips and the guac, although outrageously expensive, was good (nothing I couldn't have made myself, which is why $13 for a large bowl is a bit annoying).  I split the Ahi Tuna dish, which had mushrooms, potatoes, and pomegranate seeds in it.  Delicious- and glad I split, considering the price and the amount of chips and guacamole i ate. plus i ate at el charro earlier anyway.

First off the space is amazing. Bright colors, flashy walls, a fun bar area and a HUGE open dinning area. LOVED the atmosphere. I would love to come back on a weekend night for a girl's night filled with some live music, dancing and beverages.  The food was great. Guacamole is one of my favorite foods and this one was super chunky, just the way I like it. We also order the ceviche trio and while it was tasty, I thought the portions of the ceviche were way to small for everyone to have a taste. Overall I just prefer Nationale 27's ceviches. My rents loved the plantains and although I thought they were yummy, they were a bit too sweet for me to have more than a few bites.  As for the entrees, everything was mmm mmm good and everyone was happy with their choice. I ordered the braised short ribs which were shredded up and served over some whipped mashed potatoes. I ate it up in a heart beat. My parents order the Churrasco and the Mama Mendez ""fish dish"" and both were extra good. Overall a great dinning experience. We had a hard time picking out our meals and I would love to go back.  Now for the fun part, the drinks.

It had its own private bar, and two levels, but both were small enough that the room still felt intimate and appropriately crowded with about 40 people there. The guacamole sitting at the bar was the first delicious treat I encountered, followed closely by a delicious mojito with fresh mint that was wonderful and not-too-sweet. The passed appetizers were tasty too, and while I don't know their names, there was one with shredded spicy pork that I only wish I could have had more of. And then the meal itself was phenomenal, although I must admit that I like the first course (Ropa Vieja on Plantains and Arepas) the best. I chose the Seafood Paella as my entree. It was fantastic, although I must admit it lacked any of the burnt crispies that I think are the best part of a good paella. My husband chose the Churrasco (a beef tenderloin on a goat cheese puree with delicious spicy beets), and he was the winner of the night. And, the service was prompt, smooth, and friendly. No complaints at all.

And I've definitely had better churros.  The highlight of the meal was actually a side of mac and cheese I ordered!  It was creamy, more like fettucini alfredo, and coated with crispy breadcrumbs.  Excellent sangria, too--not too sweet and with a hint of citrus.  Probably the best sangria I've tasted.   All in all, this place is worth a try, for certain menu items and the bright, cheery atmosphere--especially in the midst of a dreary Chicago winter.  But I don't think I'd go back again, unless someone else was paying!",0.9956,0.684,0.301,0.016,0.48063492063492064

We had a reservation, and I think we only had to wait five minutes to be seated--just long enough to get a few cocktails. I admit, I hear that the cocktails here are amazing, and I was sick so didn't drink, so keep in mind that my 5-stars comes without even having sampled one of the staples of the menu.  I don't even remember what I ate. All I know is that every single dish from the appetizer to the dessert was scrumptious. We all shared, so sampled a good cross-section of the menu, and there was nothing that I didn't like: only food that I liked, and liked more.  Carnavale is also conveniently located off of the Eisenhower, and had available street parking, though valet was also offered.  Also a great place for all kinds of occasions--you could come here with a group or on a date.

I often hesitate to say to a server, ""it's our first time"" only because I hate schpiels. Or maybe I just hate them at The Macaroni Grill (oh, for shame). Regardless, I was grateful for his suggestions, and my husband and I trusted him the entire way through, from first course to dessert. He was extremely attentive and effusive with kindness even on a busy Friday night. Personally, I appreciate the segmented dining. We were totally put in the couple's room, a nice quiet atmosphere with a mosaic of fun bottles of top shelf alcohol. Good marketing for what turned out to be my first experience with Caipirinha. I will have it again. Many times. Delicious.  Though it was good, I'm not sure how soon we will be back for us but I would love to take out of towners there.

My uncle ordered a bottle of wine at the bar which he brought to the table when we were seated- definate plus.

I'm mentioning this because I expected more mixed crowd on the floor and I was surprised. Anyway, I'm giving them 5 stars and here's why. VALET: solves the inconvenient and expansive parking in Chicago AMBIANCE:  beautiful. They probably spent at least a million for the space. warm and dimmed lighting, overall color pallets, surprising details with the interior space (ex. wine wrecks & mirrors, even the bathrooms) I fell in love with the space as soon as I walked in. It's an up-scale restaurant, but it's not intimidating at all. If anything, you'll feel so welcomed by the space.  STAFF: I expected drop dead gorgeous stuck up staffs to be working... but they were all very normal people. They weren't afraid to joke around with you, laugh with you, my waitress almost felt like one of our friend by the end of the night. She was very calm, kindly guided us throughout the menu, answered every question perfectly and sincerely, She made us feel like we were home. Everything went so smoothly and I thank her so much for providing such wonderful experience. Their neckties were super cute by the way. FOOD: Unless you order too much perfect portion, perfect taste, perfect presentation, great quality. Dare to try 27 oz steak. My girlfriend finished it and ever since we do not treat her as a human. My seafood dish was absolutely amazing.  DRINK: Delicious of course! Great selection of wines. PRICE: not cheap but definitely worth it. Rather than taking your lover or a romantic dinner, I would take my parents or family here. Strangely, I cannot see myself being romantic in this place. It's a very fun place to go. I believe the perfect size would be from 4 people to 6 people. Don't be afraid to share your food. They encourage you to do so.

I've eaten here several times, and it never fails to disappoint. This is yet another Jerry Kleiner theme restaurant, and I must say my favorite. From the moment you walk in, it's a feast for the eyes with vibrant colors. In fact it's other worldly. The décor is obviously Cirque du Soleil inspired which puts a surreal vibe in the air. Seeing as this restaurant offers pan-Latin cuisine (or as our waiter called it, ""Latin Soul Food"" cuisine), I don't quite get the connection to the décor...but it's such a delight to the senses that I won't ask questions. The bar, which I've frequented in the past, also serves dinner and has a festive atmosphere from another world, but the dining room is ""the"" place to be. We started off with their Mojitos, which our waiter bragged are known as the best in town and are made perfect down to a science. You know what? He was right. It was the best in town I've tasted, with just the slightest hint of sweetness (one of my pet peeves is a mojito that tastes like someone dumped a ton of sugar into it). They're addictive. On to our appetizer; I've always been impressed that Carnivale offers five different kinds of Ceviches. I've tried one or two here or there, but was happy that my friend agreed on sharing a ""tasting"" of all five, which were served with Chicago flatbread (make sure to ask for extra flatbread, they are generous about that).  All were incredible, my favorite being the ""Camarones"", a spicy shrimp ceviche. On the waiter's favorite recommendation, I tried the ""Churrasco"" as my entree, which he described as Nicaraguan style beef tenderloin. It was served on top of this incredible goat cheese puree, with some type of pureed arugula sauce drizzled on top (I normally hate arugula, but in this instance it was the perfect condiment).  I purposely ate my entrée in slow motion so that it would never end. ""I Love Food"" Yelper Tiffany did the same. All in all yet another great experience here.

They also have decent drinks: Their blueberry mojito was delicious but the classic margarita tasted a bit too tart.

I don't know if I was setting myself up for something impressive based on word of mouth or reviews and the awesome decor but the food was just ok to me. Our group ordered The braised beef and plantain appetizer (Ropa Vieja) maybe a bit too salty for my taste (and I love salt). For an entree I ordered the Chef Daily Fish Special and they were out of the fish they were using so they substituted the Artic Char the dish wasnt very flavorful and the fish a bit bland. I tried some of the halibut and glazed pork shoulder and they were somewhat decent. My boyfriend ordered the new york strip and it wasn't anything special.

2008-08-18,4.0,"A taste sensation That I can see the neon of Carnivale from my apartment and that it spoke to me like a beacon weren't the only reasons I wanted to try [and like] Carnivale: I'd heard from a few friends what a great space it was, what wonderful cocktails they shook and how delicious the food was. I really couldn't resist. I was first and foremost amazed by the sheer loft of the dining room. The place is GINORMOUS and then some. The height of the room allows for some very creative painting and lighting of the space, but it does feel a bit cavernous and perhaps misses the opportunity to be a party place and offer moments of intimacy at the same time; tricky, but achievable for sure. You have to start with a signature cocktail even if you're going to move to wine with the meal [something I have turned into a habit at Carnivale]. My favorite concoction is the Cadillac Margarita, the real deal: Corralejo Reposado tequila, Grand Marnier and freshly squeeze lime juice. It's hard to stop at one. For an appetizer, you can't go wrong with the seviche ""flight"". Choose all 5 or any 3 of their wonderful seviches to go with your drink. The Kleiner guac [so akin to my own] and taco de Pescados are also very flavorful, the latter not unlike a fish taco you might find in San Diego, only miniaturized as appetizer. If you're a fan of pig, try the Empanada de Puerco, pork picadillo with plantain ""masa"" and chayote slaw with aji rocoto yoghurt sauce.  I will admit that I am spoiled for Carnivale's pork and fish dishes for a main course. If you find me there, I'm likely to be eating the rum-glazed pork shoulder with fried plantains and Puerto Rican rice and beans. The arctic char is surprisingly flavorful, but it's the carrot escabeche on arugula with tamarillo chile purée that is worth the dish alone. Alaskan halibut is another delicate treat, spiced up with local zucchini escalivada, lemon garlic aioli and chorizo bread crumbs, to die for. Look for a daily fish special too.  Plenty of sides are available, but buy them to share. There is plenty of food on your plate without having to order side dishes, unless that's how you roll. Fried yucca with garlic mojo is a stand out as too are the organic mushrooms with bacon and leeks [a nice side if you go for beef tenderloin or strip steak]. I don't usually order dessert when dining out, but sometimes something sounds just too perfect. One night the special was blueberry brioche bread pudding with caramel sauce and cinnamon ice cream. Dude, it has my name written all over it. I couldn't resist. I couldn't finish it, but I couldn't say no. Sometimes desserts just speak to me. Prick up your ears when your waitperson lists that day's dessert selection.  Get thee to Carnivale. I'll see you at the host's stand.",0.9962,0.803,0.157,0.04,0.6090022675736962

2008-07-20,3.0,"When Carnivale first opened a few years ago it was impossible to get a reservation here, which I even stated in my February 2006 Yelp review. So when I called just a few days ago to make a reservation for a party of 6 on Saturday evening I was surprised that they had availability.  This should have been a clue to me that Carnivale isn't quite what it used to be, but sometimes it takes me a little bit to catch on... While the atmosphere is still cheerful and fun (perfect for a girls night out) the food and the service was pretty disappointing.  Our waitress spent most of the evening ignoring us. Once she finally paid attention to us we ordered a few drinks to get the fun night started. I was upset to hear that the raspberry mojito is no longer on their menu, but tried a blueberry mojito instead....good, but not quite as tasty as the raspberry.  We started our meal with the guacamole and chips and while we had no problem polishing it off everyone at the table remarked it was a bit too chunky and unremarkable.  As for our main entrees I ordered the halibut, recommended by our waitress. It was extremely dry and bland. It probably would have been better if I had dipped it in the huge glob of garlic mayo on the side of my plate, but mayo just really doesn't do it for me.  A few of the other girls ordered the fish special, which they thought was just ok...especially after one of them pretty much choked on a bone. The only person who actually really enjoyed her meal at the table with my friend who is pregnant with twins...and I think she's pretty much liking any food these days as she eats for 3.  She ordered the billy's chicken and stated that you really can't go wrong with buttery chicken and fries. True, true.  We also ordered 2 side dishes: plantains and fried yuca. The plantains were actually quite good. The yuca was much thicker than expected (I swear it was thin and crispy during my last few visits) and full of garlic. We asked one of the servers about this and he responded we could cut it if we wanted to make it thinner. Seriously??? We were celebrating 2 birthdays so they did bring out 2 complimentary desserts (1 extra star for carnivale and our indifferent waitress).  Never one to turn down dessert I tried both of them while thinking ""why am i eating these...they aren't even very good.""

We started off with the blueberry mojito.  Mmmm!!  I am not a big drinker because I admit that I'm weak sauce but that was delicious and the perfect sweetness.  For appetizers, we had the guac, the empanada and ropa vieja.  The guac was great as usually and the empanada completely satisfied my empanada craving that Nacional 27 and Las Tablas could not satisfy.  My favorite is still the ropa vieja as it has a very unique flavor to it and is just so scrumptious.   We split an entree of pernil and although it seemed a tad bit overcooked, it was still very good.  We had the espresso flan for dessert that had ice cream and caramel popcorn on top.  Sounds a little different but the popcorn complemented the espresso flan very well.  I liked the other flan that I had better before but this was good in its own way too.

He was great (and a nice guy, we chatted), as was the rest of the band.  - The decor is colorful and lively, with no shortage of beautiful women adorning the walls. I don't mind that.  - The skirt steak was damn tasty...I believe it's called Arrachera on the menu...could have been a a teeny bit more tender, but I loved the flavors, especially the sweet red onion and chimichurri sauce.

I never went here when it was the meatlocker that was Drink, but the two story open factory space is used very well! Carnivale has filled it with vibrant colors everywhere, a wall of wines on the second floor with lights that slowly change color behind them, and plenty of colorful flourishes.  I started with the Tortilla Soup- not as complex as Frontera's, but each flavor sings- avocado, lime, cilantro, and chicken. My group shared the Ceviche tasting and I was partial to the Mixto. See Deb H's pictures of the Ceviche!  My main course was the Jibarito Sandwich- grilled prime ribeye, arrugla, cheddar cheese, avocado mayo, between fried plantains. The sandwich was good, especially the avo mayo, but the prime ribeye was greasy and a bit fatty. I loved that everything was sandwiched between two fried plantains! Two friends had the Arrachera and I will try this next time: marinated skirt steak, rice and beans, sweet onions, chimichurri. One friend had the Churrasco Salad and said the wood-grilled beef tenderloin was done to perfection! It looked like it too!

The decor is Kleiner-style, like the gaucamole: Huge chandeliers and lamps covered in red stuff. Curtains. Interesting bathrooms.  The food is quite good. Well, at least the beef is quite good. We got the ceviche sampler because they didn't have enough Kona Kampachi to bring a full order. Turns out there's a reason for that. All the other ones were teh sucks! So get that Kona Kampachi if you want ceviche.  For other apps we had the empanada (excellent with the radish or whatever that red stuff was), the guac (bitchen), and the ropa vieja (very good and perfect for sharing with a few other people). For the main course I tried three different steaks: skirt, ribeye, and filet and all were excellent. I tried my sister's shrimp that came with her fish and it was ok, not great. The real highlights for me though were the plantains and yucca. Best I've ever had. Dessert was small because we were so dang full.  Aside from the ceviche incident, the only downsides I found were the service. First, the waitress kept trying to upsell us on more expensive tequila and cuts of meat. That's a little annoying. Also, the wait time for a mixed drink was exceptionally long. That's it though. This isn't the most sophisticated meal you'll ever ever eat, and I wouldn't go to town on a steak and plaintains if I were planning to get totally shitfaced and show off my wristwatch at Victor Hotel after dinner. It is, however, a more complete and upscale alternative to Las Tablas or Tango Sur. Think Rios D' Sudamerica on Armitage, but with better execution.",0.9456,0.853,0.106,0.041,0.5350396825396825

The place is gorgeous, elaborate and vibrant like the other Jerry Kleiner restaurants. It is also very specious... it wasn't as big as I was imagining, but there were also hidden private rooms that I wasn't able to see. The decor and the trendy atmosphere is reason alone to go! I was seated on the ground level, right by a huge, beautiful painting that my friend, David Molinaro, painted. It made for a nice photo backdrop! :) We got there early so we sat in the bar and enjoyed the yummy guac and tasty drinks. Their mojitos are amazing and I also got a drink special that was a Caipirinha with mango and pineapple. It was very good but SUPER strong!  Now, onto dinner. I read many of the yelp reviews and was excited about the pernil (pork shoulder) dish. I have to say, either it was an off night, or it just wasn't all that it was hyped to be. It had a good flavor, I think it was rum-glazed and it was a little sweet, but the shredded pork seemed a little dry. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't great. I did, however, try two of my friends' steak dishes and they were AMAZING! Super tender and really flavorful! I tried my other friend's chicken and it was not that great, either, but for me, chicken is hard to impress with. We also got the ceviche sampler and it was pretty tasty... I think the one with squid was my favorite.  Oh, I did want to comment on the service, as well. At first, it was pretty good, but then near the end I felt like our server wasn't coming back to check up on us when he should have been. And, as with the other KDK restaurants, you are definitely paying the price for good food and a great atmosphere-it is not cheap, especially if you are drinking the yummy drinks... it adds up quickly!

On our last visit we had a 9pm reservation and didn't get sat until 10. They obviously didn't know who dey was messin wit! It was saturday night so it was a bit crunk. We hung out at the bar in the dimly lit lounge, had a few overpriced cocktails and watched hoochies do what they do and old men flashin cabbage. The beer selection is very NOT extensive but the dirty martini is friggin grrrreat! My girly orders foofy drinks that she says are yummy. A dj spun down tempo latin beats that made the vibe a bit more chill. The flat screens played a cheaply filmed dvd of the real carnivale celebration. Titty Parade! So an hour later our vibrator goes off and my girl blushes. We're escorted into the dining room and to our table. The room is well lit, has a super high ceiling and is splashed with vibrant colors. We are greeted by a short and snooty guy who resembled Chris Daughtry (he has a heart as cold as ice). The tude needed an adjustment. So we order some of our usual tapas. One of our favorites is the arepa. Its a corn cheese cake topped with mushrooms and drizzled with a goat cheese dressing. Its so flavorful it almost tastes like a meat dish. We also had the ropa vieja. They put some serious love in the braised beef. The mixto pairs three ceviches which includes tuna, barramundi and squid all of which were unique, colorful and refreshing. The artic char was also refreshing with its sweet, sour and salty flavors . Some of the dishes were undesirable and forgettable. One of them was the empenadas which was very dry. Another was the mini white fish tacos which tasted like battered and fried dirt. Desserts are nice. We ordere d the plantain bread pudding but, unfortunately, it was so delectable they decided to take it off the menu. A bag of suck!

2008-02-09,5.0,"Where do I start?!?!? I booked a reservation for 3 for February 9th at 5:30pm for my 21st birthday.  I always like to try a brand new place on my birthday, and Carnivale did not disappoint. I'll break the experience down by categories: The actual restaurant: Carnivale is one of the coolest looking places around.  The multicolored decor and the live atmosphere enhance everything and really makes you feel like you are someone more important than you probably are.  There are multiple rooms, including a wide open bar.  The main dining room is phenomenal, and probably the most colorful dining room I have ever seen.  The servers walk around in all black with small ties and the front desk staff members were all jazzed up in business clothing. The Drinks: Remember, this was my 21st birthday, so I finally had a reason to look at the drink menu.  I know they are known for their Raspberry mojitos here, but their regular mojito is way better.  The Raspberry one has so much raspberry flavor that it is too overpowering.  If you like raspberries, order it. The Appetizers: Best guacamole in the world, I promise.  Its smooth and chunky and amazing all at the same time.  Add home made tortilla chips, and you have the ultimate appetizer.  Carnivale is famous for their guacamole as well as their Ceviches, so we ordered a sampler of three separate ones.  The Camarones, Arctic Char, and Atun Tiradito were the three we chose.  My personal favorite was the Atun, which was a thin slice of ahi tuna topped with avocado and a Serrano chile pepper. (By the way, I think I was able to eat about 3 whole avocados when you add up the guac and ceviches I polished off) The Entrees: There were so many unique choices, but I had my heart set on the Pernil, which was a Rum Glazed Pork Shoulder served with rice, beans, and fried plantains.  This was, I promise, I really promise, the best pork I have ever tasted.  I originally thought it would be like a tenderloin, but it was actually shredded, and when you eat it with the rice and beans, you have the ultimate meal.  Plus, who doesn't love fried plantains?  My friends entrees were the Costilla de Res, and the Arrachera.  The first was a short rib serves with mashed potatoes and a corn peanut salsa.  I tried a bite, but short ribs don't do much for me.  The Arrachera, which was a skirt steak with chimichurri sauce, was fantastic.  The sauce was so sweet that the steak was pretty much a second thought on the plate.  All three of us licked are plates clean. The Desserts: Its my birthday so of course I ordered dessert.  The choices were sort of similar.  I decided on the Dulce de Leche, which was a chocolate lava cake, with real dulce de leche sauce, and cinnamon ice cream.  It was decent, but I knew right away I should've ordered their signature Tres Leches Cake instead.  My friends split the Autumn Squash Bread pudding and the Key Lime tart, both very good. The Service: Perfect.  Really, if I had to think of one thing I would change, it would be......actually nothing.  For the first time in my life the service was perfect.  Josh, our server, told us everything we knew, guided us through the menu, explained was Ceviches were, recommended his favorites, and refilled our drinks and cleared our plates the way it should be done.  He even comped my dessert for my birthday. Overall: Please do yourself a favor and come here.  Carnivale is second to none, from the atmosphere, to the service, to the food, you will not find a cooler place to spend an evening, especially a birthday.",0.9986,0.833,0.158,0.009,0.49739796358843974

FOOD - APPETIZERS Mofongo: They were kind of like falaffels, except with the consistency of cornmeal in the middle.  It comes with a tomato sauce that is a little on the bland side in my opinion.  But still pretty tasty. Arepa: This was fantastic.  It's basically a corn and cheese cake with mushrooms.  Tremendous flavors.  Comes with a salad that was also very well flavored. FOOD - ENTREES Mama Mendez' Arroz Con Mariscos: Sort of like a paella.  Lots of rice with various seafood and chorizo.  It was decent though a bit pricy at $25 in my opinion.  But definitely filling and it comes out piping hot (always a good thing in my book) Borrego: Colorado lamp chops.  Holy schmoly this dish were good!  Best lamp chops I have ever had, even better than the ones at Sola.  The meat was so ridiculously tender and cooked perfectly.  It also comes with a goat cheese puree and a spicy beat salsa.  But it's all about the lamp chop.  My only complaint is that I only got three chops for $38.   Fried Yuca: We got this as a side. Nice garlicky flavor.  Nothing special but good enough. FOOD - DESSERT Bread Pudding: This was a bit funky, as there were pieces of roasted squash in the bread pudding and it was topped with a scoop of ginger ice cream (the ginger flavor is STRONG).  I wasn't a bit fan of it but that depending on your taste buds, you might like it. SERVICE Top notch.  The bus boys refilled our waters and cleared our plates very efficiently.  Our server was very friendly and knowledgable about the menu.  If you tell your server it's your first time at Carnivale, odds are you will receive a grandiose explanation about the different things on the menu.  My only minor gripe was that I had to wait to see the drink menu a second time because our server was busy chatting it up with other patrons.  Keeping the alcohol coming should always be a server's top priority! OVERALL My gf and I enjoyed our meal immensely.  It's terrific dining experience that combines a creative menu with excellent service.  It's definitely not cheap and you can probably get comparable food at much lower prices if you wander around Logan Square (Fonda del Mar) and Bucktown (Rios de Sudamerica).  But it's definitely worth going to if you're looking for a great meal as part of your night out on the town.",0.997,0.8,0.173,0.027,0.6212027914614124
2008-01-18,1.0,"If I could give this place negative stars, I would give this place -10 stars. Here is my experience at Carnivale....  Me and my Fianc had made reservations for Carnivale for 9:30pm for a party of 2 for Friday January 18. I got there at 9:25 all excited because I have heard so many good things about Carnivale. On arrival me and my fianc checked in with the hostess. She looked on her screen for Smith. She said all that she had was Smith party for 7. The hostess handed us the pager anyway and asked us to wait by the bar. After 30 minutes my fianc went to the counter and asked the host if she was going to page us anytime soon. She said that she is just waiting for a couple of tables to clear. ANOTHER 15 MINUTES... STILL NOTHING. We patiently waited and waited AND WAITED FOR A TOTAL OF 45 MINUTES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OUR RESERVATION WAS AT 9:30 NOT 10:15! After having enough, I returned the pager to the host. I told him that the wait time was RIDICULOUS. 45 MINUTES?!?! He took the pager and said, ""What do you think that you are doing? I was just about to page you."" Page me???? ""My reservation was at 9:30!!!!"" I said to him. He replies, ""No I see here that your reservation is at 10PM for Smith.""  I can't believe that they changed my reservation without even telling me. They could have at least notified me that there was a mistake or apologize. I threated to leave and it didn't even phase the host. He just shrugged and turned the other way. If that's the host's attitude can you imagine what the upper management's attitude is like? F* that! Carivale's wait time and the snobby hosts and hostesses is absolutely ridiculous. If you like snobby hosts and having them screw up your reservations then Carnivale is the place to be!!!",-0.6679,0.867,0.06,0.073,0.5548611111111111

The fish tacos were great, very tasty sauce and there was, to my surprise, actually a decent amount of fish in each taco.  Homemade guac always deserves props.  For my main course, I had the ribeye - highly recommend it.  I asked our server what was better, the pork shoulder or pork chop - he claimed the pork chop.  Then between pork chop and ribeye? He did not hesitate to go ribeye.  I had a bite of a friend's pork chop, and the server was correct - ribeye all the way!  One of the more surprising things about this place too was that when the bill came, it didn't hurt too much.  Service probably could have been a little better, we waited a long time past our reservation, but this place is very cool and a great value.  Definitely check it out, it's worth your while.",0.9955,0.746,0.254,0.0,0.45940000000000003

The bar is in a good location where you see all the beautiful people (Women) as they come in.  Drinks are good, decently priced and depending on the time that you arrive you'll either find a band playing, a DJ mixing, or some good salsa music in the background Once you've had a drink or two and you're ready for your dinner.  The hostess escorts you to the main dining area.  You walk through a doorway that separates the ""waiting area."" and you feel as though you've stepped over the magic gateway. The dining area is massive.  with a main room, upstairs dining areas and side dining rooms.  I like to be out of the way but still able to see and feel the energy so I enjoy the side dining areas.   The food is very enjoyable. They put time and effort into it, and give you a chance to go the tapas route or have main course entrees.  Although the food is not super spectacular you do feel as though it was worth the trip.   Once your dinner is over and you're there at the right time, you can move back to the front waiting area where the bar will probably be a little more crowded but a dance floor has emerged as well. Well for me, with latin food in my stomach and the latin music playing through the course of dinner, I can't think of a better way to end the night but to dance.   Carnivale is an experience. Very enjoyable. The hostess' are somewhat snotty but not so much to turn you off. The waiters are great and very helpful.  The few times I've been I've always enjoyed myself.

Anyway, after turning the corner to go into the dining area, I was blown away by the decorations. I thought they were wonderful! As for the party, there were plenty of servers moving around with samples. I'm not a fan of seafood of any kind, but the shrimp and scallops tasted okay. I didn't finish them, but I managed to eat half. (That's something, right?) The steak strips were a little chewy. Nachos were amazing. There was also a buffet set up for us to make our own tacos. I didn't try that, but everything looked good. Apparently though, the food was set up so that you got the meat first, and then the taco shells, and then the dressings. Someone mentioned something to one of the servers, but they did nothing about it. I had a couple of drinks (or 6 or 7) and they were good. The bartender was fast and most of the drinks were strong.

We ordered:   * ropa vieja - nice little pieces, served on maduros slices with some Cuban pico and some kind of cream sauce drizzled over top. Tasty like it should be, but mine's still better ;)  * beef empanada - VERY tasty! The pastry dough was just perfect; flaky and tender and could stand up to the BLAST 'o' flavors inside  * guac and chips - darned good guac. I didn't even pick out the tomatoes, which I normally eschew in my guac. The chips were flaky yet strong, and oh, so flavorful; the perfect accompaniment to the guac  * hearts of palm salad - this was about the only blah thing I ate, but even this was good, for a salad.  * arrachera - it was a tie between this and the ropa vieja for the star of the show. The beef was so tender a knife was not necessary; it just nearly melted in my mouth. So blasted good.  * pineapple-mango upside-down cake - this was good. Very dense and moist, and the little scoop of vanilla bean-flecked ice cream is a great complement to the cake.   * Venezuelan chocolate cake - WOW. Blew the upside-down cake outta the water. VERY chocolatey, not bitter, and not cloyingly sweet, still warm...deelish. You can get pretty much this same cake at any upscale restaurant, but it was done well here, too.  * cafe con leche - still better from my neighborhood place in Logan Square (go to Pancho's! /plug), but this was a nice way to finish off the meal The decor is just beautiful. I have a Kevin Bacon connection to the designer, so I was interested to see what the oft-mentioned cavernous ceilings were like, and all the colors...well, this place just BURSTS with color. And oversized everything; the lights, the shades, mirrors, art pieces on the wall. And all just absolutely beautiful. Awesome place. And the stairs at the end of the dining room...well, a scene in a musical or a special dance number is just BEGGING for that stage. I even admired the floor, which had a sort of weathered look about it, no doubt intentionally, but also meant to coincide with normal wear. Hell, even though the bathrooms are practically located IN Latin America, the way to get there is pretty cool - the hallway downstairs is decorated with pictures of women of various levels of buxomness. It was just awesome. I even liked the bathroom.  About the only thing that I could even sigh about is the somewhat brisk attitude of the host up front.

2007-07-23,5.0,"UPDATE 2/19/08: So I think I've come here enough times to finally give this restaurant the 5 star that it deserves! I've had a chance to try so many Latin American restaurants in the city, and I find myself comparing them all to Carnivale. I cannot rave enough about their guacamole and their chips.  Its something so simple, but you'll be surprised HOW GOOD it can be when done right. I've managed to try a lot of their dishes and I have got to say their ceviche is still the best, and their beef dishes are out of this world. I would suggest ordering any of their steak/ribeye dishes or even their braise short ribs. I had my birthday dinner here with 20 other guests and they all loved it. My mom was impressed with their service, which says a lot because she likes to complain. I've had many wonderful meals here and will continue to do so!!  I had dinner at Topolobampo this past weekend and seriously..DISAPPOINTING. Come here instead. You'll pay less...WAY less and have much better food. Even Frontera can not compare. **************************************** I really really love the decor of this restaurant. I think I stared more at the restaurant's decor than my boyfriend. Haha... but seriously, super high ceilings, fun and festive decor, great place for group dinners, and they even have private rooms. While we were waiting for our table (which, was my fault, since i had made reservations and somehow thought it was one hour later than it was, stupid me) they had live jazz playing with a live singer. We were even able to order appetizers at the bar, which was also another plus cuz we hadn't eaten all day. We ordered the guac and ceviche, which were both soo good. Highly suggest getting their ceviche, i hear its their specialty, and now i know why. Its better than the ceviche i've had in Central America! I know, you are like ""what? get out!"" but its true. I ordered the seared ahi tuna and the bf ordered the bistek steak. He absolutely loved his, that he licked his plate, but in a really sophisticated manner. Ok so he didn't lick it, but he did clean off his plate. My entree on the other hand, was disappointing (the reason for the 4 stars). The ahi tuna was flavorless. It was accompanied with guacamole and tomatoes on the side. The tuna wasn't that fresh, and I had to rely heavily on the tomatoes (which was tossed in a salad kind of way) for flavor. We had the chocolate cake for dessert, which was fabulous, served with a side of strawberry ice cream, drizzled with strawberry syrup.

I love global chill ambience and I love this restaurant. We love the food, too, but I don't have detailed notes on that for this review. More on the next visit. It is great, too, that it is so close to the Loop. Being so close to the Loop is also a bad thing - parking nearby is troublesome and the neighborhood is quite run down.

2007-07-14,5.0,"My first ever five-star rating!  There were 10 of us in the group dining at Carnivale, so we got to order an array of dishes - and NONE could even be considered average. Everything was delicious. We had the ahi tuna ceviche and the Ropa Viejo for starters. The ahi tuna ceviche was really refreshing. The crunch of the jicama, the creaminess of the avocado and the firm flesh of the ahi tuna all provided for a fresh and amazing texture experience for your palate. The Ropa Viejo on the other hand was deliciously flavorful. The sweetness and softness of the plantains counteracted the richness of the mayonnaise and the heavy texture of the beef.  For my entree, I had the primerib. I was rendered speechless. Actually, we all were speechless after taking the first bite off our entrees. One, we were all that hungry. Two, they were all that good. Being in great company, we started offering each other a try of everyone's entrees - passing around slivers of beef, lamb and fish.  Let me start off with the primerib though. Tender, well-seasoned, cooked just right. Balanced with the caramelized onions on top, and the garlic-flavored yucca under it, it was a great eat.  Next, the lamb chops. Wow. Just as tender as the beef I had, and the seasoning was awesome. It had the right amount of rosemary and other spices, with a hint of the charred flavor that can only come from wood-grilling. Skirt steak - probably the one that is most value for money. At $17, this entree is a steal! It was so good I wanted to trade mine for my friend's! And I liked my dish! Lastly, the Barramundi. I've had my beef (pardon the pun) with seafood in landlocked areas. You just don't get them fresh enough. While there are lakes around Chicago and Detroit (where I came from), I still haven't found the perfectly cooked fresh fish (which is why I don't order it much). This was it. The kind of freshness I was looking for - firm flesh, not overly seasoned so the delicate flavor of the fish was intact, with just the right portion size you won't feel like someone served you what was leftover from the tail of a goldfish! Desserts (yes, I'm not done yet. lol) The flan was one of the most creamy ones I've had my whole life, and trust me, my standards for flan are quite high because my cousin makes the creamiest, melts-in-your-mouth flan. (Hopefully, by publicly praising her, she'll eventually give me the recipe! It's called bribery and it works.) The caramel syrup drizzled on it was not too overpowering either (which is normally the case with restaurant-served flans. Either the caramel or the vanilla just destroys the custard itself!) We also got the molten chocolate cake, but before I could even get my hands on it, the plate was already a mess of crumbs and melted ice cream. I guess it was good. I had sangria for drinks. Two, actually. So yes, it's worth ordering too. It's a good accompaniment to the dishes they serve, because the alcohol won't destroy your taste buds such that you won't appreciate the food as much. Overall, Carnivale was definitely a festival of flavors that I will always go back to and recommend.",0.9944,0.848,0.128,0.024,0.5064285714285713

The chairs and floors and private dining areas are similarly themed; and the lighting is bright enough that you have no problem reading your menu, but dim enough to make it intimate, even in the huge space. Plus, even though we were all seated at a 10' round table, I had no problem hearing those around and across from me.  Food-wise? I had these short-ribs and while it definitely looked like barf (brown meat with brown sauce with corn and peanut salsa - the plating needed a little help), it tasted like heaven, and was so tender that it all but cut itself.

For the most part, Carnivale delivered. I was a little surprised to see people there who were dressed down... I was also let down by the host situation. After standing in front of the host desk for a few minutes while the hostess ignored me, I finally was able to let them know we were there for our 7pm reservation. She said fine, go wait by the door to be seated. Ok...so we waited by the door for 10-15 minutes, while they ushered other parties in and didn't acknowledge us. Hm. So then I went back and asked the hostess if we had time to have a drink, since apparently it was going to be a bit of a wait. She said ""Oh, sorry, yeah"" but by that time they were ready to seat us. It would have been nice if they had told us to feel free to grab a drink at the bar, instead of sending us over to the doorway to wait. I was really disappointed in their hostess and in that aspect of the night.  The rest of the night was great.

Happily, we were wrong!  Aside from having to wait a half hour past our reservation time, Carnivale delivered. The dining area is HUUUUGE - (seats about 650, total) but the noise level was surprisingly low.  I loved the colors, the rich and lavish lighting, the 'Saturday Night Fever' dance floor that is magically floating over head, and the Latin music pulsing throughout.  And the food was delicious!  We had the empanada and the ropa vieja to start - loved the presentation, loved the flavor. For dinner, I ordered the fillet and the boyfriend had the arroz con mariscos.  Our server had described a rib eye as the special, accompanied by, what he called, ""potatoes on crack"".  Baked potatoes loaded with goat cheese and bacon and some other amazing additions.  I REALLY wanted those potatoes with my fillet.  Really.   I knew this was not Burger King - and therefore I was not guaranteed to have it my way.  The server hedged.  I protested ""It's my birthday!  Do you think the chef can make an exception?""  To which our server responded, ""EVERYONE in here is celebrating a birthday.  Believe me, that's not so special."" Ouch.  Just when I was considering we should knock a few bucks off the tip for 'smarminess', our dinner arrived and I was happy to see that I did, indeed, have the 'potatoes on crack'.   They were DELICIOUS...as was the fillet.  So tender and flavorful.  We were told that Carnivale serves up an average of 900 dinners on a weekend night.  Given that number, they'd have to be spot on with quality.

The ""hostess stand"" is more like a front desk at a hotel, and because it was crowded and no one knew quite where to stand or check in, it was a mess and no one was there to assist people coming in.

I had the ceveche trio and then the ahi tuna  entree and both were wonderful.  The crowd in this place was a strange mix of trashy hip and just plain trashy - right next to us we had a table of eight of what must have been a stripper convention - it was like a car wreck, you could not look away!

2007-03-30,3.0,"I was very excited to experience Carnivale, having read so many stellar yelps about the Latin-flavored restaurant. Upon entering, there is definitely a sense of festivity and overabundance. The restaurant section is cavernous, with private rooms and a mezzanine all adding to the dramatic effect. I actually preferred the bar area, though, with its mix of beautiful people and business types carrying over from happy hour. Carnivale's menu travels all over South America, and there are certainly enough dishes to warrant more than one visit. Our waiter was pretty helpful with suggestions, like splitting the delicious mini fish tacos as a starter. The signature guacamole is a must, and it's definitely something you can enjoy throughout the meal.  While I had heard rave reviews about the Seared Ahi and the Pernil, I went big with the NY Strip Steak. It was perfectly seasoned, and their medium rare was as close to perfect as I've had, although the fries that came with the entree were limp and somewhat bland. One thing that pervaded the whole dinner was our wait-staff continuously attempting to clear our table. This proved annoying at first, and became somewhat humorous. Simple tip: when people are still eating, that means they probably are not done with that part of the meal. We tried a few different wines from their global wine list and, while pricey ($7-12 per glass), they were noteworthy. Still, coming from San Francisco with our nearby Napa Valley, I wasn't overly impressed. After dinner, our group adjourned to the bar, where things got livelier. Our waitress was really cool, with a quick wit, and that immediately reset the tone of the night. After some beers and margaritas, the evening ended on a positive note (this certainly was invigorated by the scantily clad tequila girls parading around giving out sample drinks and otherwise being buoyant).  In the end, I think I'd come back to Carnivale more for the happening bar scene than the restaurant itself, and besides you can order food in the bar. Mix top shelf margaritas and mojitos with this sort of Latin friskiness and you just might actually have yourself a genuine carnivale.

You total all 3 together and get an overpriced, over-hyped, and unsatisfying restaurant experience.   Reservations are required, and judging from my experience and the shoulder to shoulder crowd in the lounge, they don't mean much.  Our reservations were for 8pm, and for an hour and 10 minutes I drank 2 $5 beers and bumped body parts with about 50 people until 9:10pm when we were finally seated.  It's inexplicably to me how a restaurant can do business like this.  (As with other posts, I can't stand waiting longer than 10 to 15 minutes if I made reservations.  It's unacceptable.)  I will say, as a caveat, our group was made up of 12, which makes seating much more difficult, but it's not an hour and 10 minutes difficult. The service was average.  It wasn't equal to the gratuity paid for it.  (Our server was little creepy.  Long haired pony-tail dude.  Just seemed weird.  I know, I know, never judge a book by it's cover.) The food itself was average, nothing crazy.  I had a flank steak of some sort.  It wasn't memorable.  So, I probably ordered the wrong the thing. The bill was about 60 a piece, and when you are at 60 a piece you should just skip this place and go to a nicer restaurant, even if you spend slightly more.   I will say, the one very, very cool thing about Carnivale is the 'IN' factor it has.  The patrons, male/female, were great for people watching.  Sitting next to my girlfriend it was really hard not to notice women that were dressed incredibly sexy.  (I am sure the men were the same, but wasn't paying too much attention there.)  The crowd did appear to be, overwhelmingly female making Carnivale the type of place the ladies visit before going out on the town for the night.   In the end it just felt like a bigger, louder version of Adobe Grill.",0.234,0.858,0.067,0.075,0.6205976430976432

The colorful vibrancy of Carnivale is just beggin' for a party, so it was a great spot to celebrate my birthday last Thursday.  My in-laws from STL treated my husband and me, and they were amazed by how this 400 seat restaurant filled so quickly.  It's a huge space, for sure, but Carnivale manages to escape the trap of feeling like a cavernous gallery or museum-esque spot. The food is nicely prepared and presented, full of layered flavors.  We enjoyed the delicious scallop ceviche special, which had a refreshing cool and zippy combination of flavors, the ropa vieja (Cuban braised beef with sweet plantains) and guacamole.  We should've stopped there, but birthdays seem to call for gluttony, so we had the heirloom tomato salad special--unfortunately, it was a bit disappointing, as I'd expected a more Latino-inspired flavor.  Perhaps the chefs just wanted to highlight the fresh simplicity of the tomatoes...  We each ordered different entrees so we could sample a bit of everything: rum-glazed pork shoulder with rice and beans (AWESOME and the leftovers were possibly even better), Guatemalan-style chicken, NY strip with these totally amazing and enormous spicy onion rings--so good--and a vegetarian option: quinoa with golden raisins and roasted vegetables. The food was all very good, although I'd pass on the quinoa next time around... The servings were so large, our bellies were bustin' and we each had doggie bags to bring home, but we made sure to share the delicious blueberry ice cream sandwich for dessert--dreamy, creamy homemade blueberry ice cream (without chunks) sandwiched between two very tasty homemade chocolate chip cookies.  Mmm. Next time around I'll probably just opt for drinks, ceviche or appetizers and dessert (it'll be a bit easier on the wallet, too, since the in-laws won't be paying my way).  Carnivale's raspberry mojitos are very tasty and the adventurous drinkers out there may want to try the smoky margarita.  Really, it's smoky.  It's weird, but worth a sip, at least.

We waited an obscene amount of time for my reserved table, but were given chips and guac to make up for it. Our waiter was quite friendly. He gave great recommendations. I had the fish tacos and shrimp ceviche. I recommend both! One friend got a side of french fries, and after several margaritas/sangria/mojitos, they were ""the best."" I love this place for big groups. Its loud though, so prepare to yell.

2006-06-25,5.0,"I just got back here from my friend's birthday dinner.  I actually made reservations the week before, and since my friend and I were super hungry we were also able to be seated right then and there.  I'm sure it was because it was a Sunday, and we had arrived at about 6:00ish.  I love the bright colors of the interiors.  The bathroom is surprisingly dark in contrast.  It's kind of scary.  I don't like dark places because I think that it sometimes takes away from being able to see the presentation of the dishes in its entirety.  That would be ashame because the food looked great whenever you saw a waiter passing by.  Our server, Damien was very knowledgeable and right on the mark with us since we took some time deciding on what we wanted.  We had the sangria and mojito, both were absolutely fabulous.  I am not a mojito type of girl, and I really liked it here - so much so that I had 2 of them.  We had the ceviche and empanada, and both were very uniquely delicious in flavor.  We ordered both today's specials - the tuna and the prime steak.  The tuna was marvelous and had the sushi type cut.  The steak was tender and succulent.  The presentation of the steak itself was quite impressive.  It's a 26-30 oz. steak that is aged 28 days old, and is a special cut that only Carnivale gets upon the chef's request.  The bone in this steak is about 7 oz. alone and is so huge, we nicknamed it the Fred Flintstone Steak.  The portion would be perfect for 2 people.  Needless to say my friend took it home with her, and we each had a dessert.  She had the tart and I had the chocolate something, and both were equally high in quality as compared to the rest of the meal.  The chocolate was so rich and it had this perfect balance with the banana flavor and the ice cream.  I love the crispy glaze on the banana.  I could probably eat that all day....   Another must splurge at place.  It was definitely all that it was said to be.  I don't think I could do a comparison to Nacional 27 because I have ordered such different food items that are just so spectacular in their own way.",0.9958,0.809,0.163,0.028,0.6733792815371762

We had reservations and were seated on time (which apparently, is rare).  The mojito I sipped on while waiting was fabulous.  The atmosphere was open and festive and I loved the music, though I do agree with one diner that they need to turn the lights down a notch or two.  All in all, I thought we were headed for a perfect dining experience. The extensive wine list was impressive but our server's knowledge of what was on it was not.  He made generic suggestions (albeit with flare) and then brought out each bottle of wine (15 minutes later) separately.  Thankfully, I had not yet moved on to my second mojito so I realized that each bottle he brought was wrong. We tried the ceviche sampler and were very impressed with each one.  I would probably go back for drinks at the bar and to snack on these yummy concoctions.   One person ordered soup with our apps which never arrived.  we rarely saw our server to even let him know this. Dinner Entrees were either fantastic or left much to be desired.  The veg plate got bland reviews and the lamb dish got two very adamant thumbs down.  The piece of lamb served was mostly just gristle.  My braised short rib and the salmon special, however, were quite good.  Both tender and moist and unique and bold in flavor.   In the end, I will definitely be back for mojitos and apps but will choose to spend my $30 a plate elsewhere for dinner.",0.9964,0.78,0.207,0.013,0.5583634373289547

We were seated in one of the side parlors which was fine due to the noise from the packed main room. The drinks were great (try the RASPBERRY MOJITO--refreshing as well as quite the buzzmaker).

2006-02-05,3.0,"I just recently had the opportunity to dine at the current ""it"" place, Carnivale.  Some restaurants do one thing great, and you keep going back for more, but Carnivale seems to have struck the right balance between reasonable prices, good service, festive decor, and reliable (but not a-maaaazing) food.  I didn't know what to expect because I had such a difficult time getting reservations and dealt with a cold, bordering on rude hostess, but as soon as my friends and I were seated, all ill-feelings were forgiven.  We were mesmerized by the bright colors and hues splashed across ceilings and the walls which held what seemed like hundreds of bottles of wine.  The mood is bright and prepares you for an enjoyable meal.  The menu is very simple, drawing from various South American influences, and perfect for a crowd with different tastes.  Among the appetizers tried, the winners include the empanada (which is an overgrown version of any you would find in South America) and the guacamole.  The chicken dishes and the arranchera steak were also crowd pleasers.  Surprisingly, not only were the dishes very tasty, but the portions were quite generous too.  I wasn't particularly a fan of the ceviche.  The fish wasn't of the freshest, right off the boat quality, but when you're paying these kinds of prices, there's not much room for complaining.  While most trendy restaurants fail to post their prices on the web, Carnivale is very upfront with what you're getting.   carnivalechicago.com   With drinks, appetizer, and entree, you can go from $25-$40/person.   Carnivale definitely reigns supreme amongst the other Kleiner restaurants.",0.9926,0.74,0.198,0.063,0.5529389880952381
