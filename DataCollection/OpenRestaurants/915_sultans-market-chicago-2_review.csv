2017-08-10,4.0,"Wow, if you're looking for a good value meal, this is the spot. $8 for a massive lamb platter is almost unheard of these days. The closest value item I can think of is the $7 Halal Guys cart platters you get in NYC - but this is much better quality imo. The lamb was very flavorful and sat on a huge pile of rice. The salads are drenched in a little too much sauce but it's still good. The real winner is easily the hummus. The same platter gives a very hearty side portion (includes naan) and it could almost be a meal alone. The paprika and olive oil on top are perfect compliments.",0.9861,0.711,0.273,0.016,0.5772222222222221
2017-08-06,4.0,"Really yummy place that won't break your wallet.  Two rice varieties: lentil rice and curry rice. Lentil rice was more of a carbheavy and beany variety with a little salted, super moist and well cooked! The curry rice is definitely drier, more basmati-like with a little bit of yellowing/masala type of taste.  Out of the three meat options, I'd say the chicken is the best, really tender and super flavorful. The lamb and other patty-like meat is definitely drier and chewier.  Cucumber salad is better than tabouli salad imo, and you can mix the yogurt dressing in with your rice and meat. Hummus was super creamy, minus the olive oil but spiced with cayenne pepper and whipped to a smooth texture. Quantity was huge for our dinners, only qualm is that they forgot our orders twice. Other than that, perfection!",0.974,0.819,0.181,0.0,0.52
2017-08-04,1.0,"Very disappointed. I had gotten the chicken schwarma sandwich. It fell apart within a couple of bites of the pita. And the chicken was cold and was just huge pieces dark meat that had tone of grizzle. I also ordered a small rice. And it was also underwhelming. It had no salt and was dry. They put their two salads on it (I had asked for it). Neither had a very good flavor, I ended up pushing it off to the side.  I might have had higher hopes, but it's cheap and you definitely get what you pay for. Their drink cooler was out of order, so all of the drinks were warm and I passed.  Will not be coming back.

I really do enjoy their tabbouleh and hummus. It's my favorite part of the meal. I have sumac at home so I stuff the pita with hummus, falafel, tabbouleh, sumac, and their tahini sauce that's on the bar. We've had their wrapped baked pastry things. I like the one with spinach. I don't know what it's called, unfortunately. Their baklava is waaay too sweet for me, but my boyfriend enjoys it (he's like a fly on sugar). The people there are friendly enough.

The place is pretty small (only can seat around 8 people) however you can usually find a seat because most of the orders are togo.  They have several different options from sandwiches, dinner plates, or a price per lb bar. The bar has a pretty good variety and is not that expensive so you can load up on anything you crave. I personally have only gotten the falafel dinner plate and chicken dinner plate; however both have been great. The plates come with rice, your chosen protein, salad, hummus, and pita. The plate is actually really filling since they pile the box til you wonder how it's going to close! The Tabouli salad is definitely a good choice to give a green freshness to the load of food you're going to consume. The falafels are really good at this place, so if you're vegetarian or just not in the mood for some meat you can grab a pretty filling meal here.

I've also had the baba ghanouj and it is equally as delicious as a cool side dish! I know the pita bread isn't homemade there because they've opened up the package in front of me. However, i need to find out what brand pita bread they use because its soft and spongey but doesnt break apart too easily when making your own sandwich! The customer service is good, it's difficult to judge that much though because I'm usually in and out so quickly. Place seems clean and well kept! Not a lot of seating but that's fine because i prefer to stuff my face embarrassingly fast alone without others judging. :) all in all, a four star.

2016-05-11,2.0,"I noticed the 4 star + average rating and figured I'd give Sultan's Market a try. I ordered the Lamb Shawerma dinner for myself and the Chicken Shawerma sandwich for my son via GrubHub delivery on 5/10. Delivery was quick and food was packaged well...which gave them the additional star.   HOWEVER : Lamb Shawerma dinner was terrible! The pieces of lamb were TINY (about 1"") and so dry/overcooked (too long under the heat lamp?) they actually crunched in your mouth. Rice and lentils were bland and the TINY triangles of pita bread were stale. The Chicken Shawerma sandwich had many little pieces of cartilage and bone in the chunks of chicken making it difficult to eat. I know the chicken is chopped with a cleaver but atleast debone it properly prior to chopping otherwise it's a serious choking hazzard. (NOT COOL when your 9 year old son is struggling to cough up a bone). Not impressed at all. It seems that prices are the main appeal in most of SM's glowing reviews.

So far 5/5 stars everything is as advertised. Negatives.  I ordered a shwarma which led the mexican?jewish?middle eastern?indian? Gentleman to decide that a white guy like me would prefer a chicken shwarma (i let it go both are good)  then instead of shaving my delightful meat off of the dead animal rotator thing he scooped my not as delightful meat out of a tray at the bottom.  So some of the meat was hard as a rock (not crispy like rice cereal.  But dried out and hard like when you sit on grandpas lap) -1 star.  Then when i am driving i reach into my bag for my treat and pull the wax paper out and get this: dude puts my sandwich in upsode down so half the shit falls out into the bag -1 star.  That is not acceptable.  I am already driving down pedestrian ridden clark st.  Playing clash of clans on my cell with one hand.  Steering with my knee.  Fighting off my dog with my right elbow while trying to hold my sandwich with my other leg and scoop the shit back in my pita with my third hand.  So dangerous.  If i hit anyone that blood would have been on your hands Sultans Market.  Know your customers.  We are bipedal homosapiens.  Not octopi.,0.9628,0.758,0.154,0.088,0.5435396825396827

I cannot believe what a bargain this is considering the amazing quality of food and quantity you get for the price. They even deliver!! Our party tried a bit of everything - the vegetarian plate, shwarma, baba ganuj, jersalem salad, zatar bread, and some flatbreads. There wasn't one disappointment on the table. Huge shout out for the baba ganuj, probably one of my favorite renditions yet. The eggplant was smoky rather than sour and even went well over the rice.

The Falafel that comes in the veggie combo was a little dry not bad once you cover it in sauce ect but on it's own it is dry. The best falfel I ever had was at Great Falafel on Diversey unfortunately they are no longer in business, they cooked falafel to order where as Sultans pre cooks and sits them under heat lamps which drys them out. Hummus and Baba ganuj where both ok but not outstanding. The meats in the combo where a little chewy with some grizzle once again ok once you cover it in sauce but on its own not great.

Nowhere near the quality that I get in the store. If I were introducing middle eastern food to a person who had never had it, they would never have it again after eating this.

There are a few low reviews claiming they had dry chicken or too much (insert picky comment here), but the overall rating still amounts to 4 stars... I think you can tell without reading this that the place is good. Overall: - cheap - fast - tasty - fun atmosphere, including BYOB To begin with the cheap comment, a ""small"" soup is $2. Sandwiches are $4-6 and combination plates are $6-7. The portions are a very good size. Yesterday, with a cold, I wanted some soup and Mama Masada's Chicken soup was what I needed. It tasted like broth that had been made with care. There were plenty of vegetables (including potato chunks?) I've had the lentil soup too, and that is also good. Yesterday I also got the vegetarian combo with falafel. At my table, I built little sandwiches of falafel, hummus, tabuli and sirachia. The combination was tasty, and after all that food I took about half of my rice with lentils home. They gave me no problem about taking a container from the salad bar for that. I've also previously had the curry rice and enjoyed that (you get to pick one of the types of rice you want in your meal). My boyfriend got the meat combination, and enjoyed it all. I tried the lamb from him, and the seasoning is kind of like that of stuffed grape leaves - which they also have!  I've never had the buffet, but that's inherently done with fast service too. The cashier was nice not only about my take home container but also bringing us waters. They are fine with BYOB, and while the sitting area isn't huge, I've never not been able to sit. It's casual overall, but if you stop and take a second, the decor is pretty cool. There are mirrored, golden tiles on the side wall and ceiling. If you sit, you might feel yourself like a Sultan.

In steps Sultan's Market. I'd never been before. I have friends who are obsessed with the place. It was time. The space is TINY but utilized very well. There is a $5.99/lb salad bar set up against one wall with some pretty tasty looking grape leaves, marinated artichoke hearts, and many other veggie items. (Next time). Then, there is a cafeteria-style set up with the shawarmas, rice, salads, breads, etc. I ordered the veggie combo dinner - you can choose between rice with lentils or a curry basmati rice, and Jerusalem salad or tabbouleh. They put a healthy heap of hummus on your plate, cut up a few falafels and a pita, and you are ready to eat! Super fast. Super cheap. I was happy.  I am now a little bit obsessed with that lentil rice. I don't know what it is. Maybe the onions. Maybe because I am Asian and obsessed with rice in general. Maybe I like the addition of the lentils. Anyway, this rice is awesome. The falafels were crispy and flavorful. I also tried a bite of J's spinach pie and chicken shawarma sandwich - both super delicious. His lentil soup was so-so - good, but other places (ahem, Taste of Lebanon) do it better. I've only been there once but I think I'm going to make the chicken shawarma dinner, lentil rice, Jerusalem salad, my standard order.  Friendly staff.

I was craving Mediterranean food on Sunday (Sundays are now officially Mediterranean food nights for me), and so I turned to Yelp! to figure out where to go. This place is literally around the corner from my apartment, and I pass by it all the time and had never gone in. My roommate mentioned how great it was as well, so I figured I'd give it a shot. Oh. my.  I ordered a falafel sandwich (I ordered it spicy), and it was huge and stuffed full of greatness. I also got 3 grape leaves and some olives from their salad bar ($5.99/lb I believe), and so my entire meal was $5 and some change. I cut the pita in half when I got home, because as I said it was huge. I also made some Greek rice to go with it, which let me save the other half for the next day....two meals for under $6 is totally do-able. The falafel really was great....it wasn't dry, very flavorful, and the toppings they put on the sandwich (tomatoes, onions, Jersualem salad, sauce, hummus) were all perfect. I ordered it spicy, and it was pretty spicy, so I'd suggest trying the medium on your first visit.  The grape leaves are great too... I find that some places have really minty grape leaves, but not here. Perfection. And it's great that you can pick out how many you want and you pay by the weight (which I actually think is cheaper than when you go order 4 for $2.50 at other places).  The second half of my sandwich, and the one grape leaf I saved, the next day were maybe even better than the first time around. Big points for having food that keeps well as leftovers. Apparently the Wicker Park location is cash only, and delivery at this location is also cash only. I don't know about that, but for take out credit cards are accepted and there's no minimum.  I was kinda thrown off when the credit card receipt had a spot for a tip (like at sit down restaurants, and they also have a tip jar), and when I gave it back to him he said ""no tip""....that was weird to me.

2009-08-18,3.0,"I'd heard Sultan's has the best falafel in Chicago, and I can't categorically deny that (because I haven't had too much falafel in Chicago), but I can definitely say that the falafel here was okay, but not great. It's definitely not the best falafel I'VE ever had (that title belongs to Mim's Cafe in St. Paul), and there were serious issues with the preparation here that give me pause. Food aside, the Clark Street branch of Sultan's is extremely small and has space for maybe eight people, all crammed near the entrance. This is a place where you get take-out. Conveniently, all vegan items are clearly marked on the wall menu. I had a falafel sandwich ($4.14 with tax) which is hastily slapped together from already-prepared ingredients, much like a Subway sandwich or a Chipotle burrito. My biggest gripe was with the temperature of the food---the falafel pieces were lukewarm, the pita was room temperature and the tahini-cucumber sauce was cold, creating a passable, but inelegant whole. At the very least, the falafel needs to be hot, and the rest can be at room temperature, but if you have any cold items in the mix, the sandwich gets all messed up. I did like the portion size, which was big enough for a meal, but also quick and cheap. This is the ideal snack or light dinner food. I also liked the hot peppers tossed in, which added a significant level of spice (albeit one that wasn't evenly distributed, because everything was slapped together, rather than mixed properly).

It wasn't particularly spicy, but I never expect Middle Eastern food to be too hot. The chicken was flavorful, but perhaps a bit on the dry side.

The lamb shawarma was delicious, and while the falafel was good, it was not great, and certainly not the best. I've had better in Phoenix, and that's not saying much. The grape leaves were good, but the most disappointment came from the spinach pie. It wasn't made with phylo dough and didn't have any feta cheese. It was made with a very hard dough and wasn't good. The place itself is also not a market, I was hoping to find little Middle Eastern chocolates and candy, but instead I left feeling disappointed.

Let's see....where do I begin? 1. The falafel are WAY too big. The smaller the ball, the better the filling-to-crispy-outside ratio. You want that. Consistently dry, probably because I have never seen them actually make the falafel, just leave in under a heat lamp. 2. Their shawarma is kept in warming drawers! WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU PEOPLE THINKING?? The whole point of skewered meats is that they roast on the spit and are sliced off, in all their juicy goodness, to order. A warming drawer just dries out the meat and defeats the whole point of spit roasting them in the first place.  3. Almost nothing is made in house. Dolmas? Nope. Baklava? Nope. Meat and spinach pies? Nope. Hummus? Not sure...but I would venture a big ol' NOPE.  Is anything here absolutely horrendous? No, but a little effort and some homemade love might make the food worth eating.

While seating is a bit tight I had a great meal of a spicy falafel sandwich (with no cucumbers). It was great; crispy falafel, soft pita and smooth hummus (although I ordered a chicken schwarama, and got falafel instead it was so good that I did not complain).   What surprised me most was the amazing salad bar for $2 less per pound that the Whole Foods one, with which I am so in love. In addition to normal salad fixings there were dolmas, brussel sprouts, sun-dried tomatoes, lots of cheese choices and fun ethnic items.  There is a good chance that the Whole Foods salad bar has just lost my loyalty to this cheaper and more extensively stocked salad bar!",0.9906,0.702,0.227,0.071,0.5243506493506493

The other 4 buddies of mine who came with me moaned over the tastes which we all tried to savor.  One in particular threw his scarf around his neck and shouted  ""Good Stuff"" as we all exited before him.  Yes, it truly was!  If you're on the run and looking for great grub, definitely stop by Sultan's!

I highly recommend the falafel here. I should note that after my 911 rolls at Sushi O Sushi the other night I was a little gun shy and got my falafel with medium spice. In hindsight, I should've gotten it with regular spice and on the side; since the pita's are deep, there wasn't enough spicy sauce to cover my falafel. However, I was so hungry I didn't want to interrupt my nosh to ask for more. I can't wait to come back here, I'll be trying out the Zetter Fettia and taking home some hummus and tabbouleh too.

A bit pricey for not having meat in it, not to mention the insance price of the poorly-stocked salad bar at $5.99/lb! Back to the meal- The falafel is generally cold, pita not warm and never any yummy sauce, unlike my fave PITA INN! On the plus side, you can get a large lentil soup for $3.31. (got that today) On to my gripe- after roughly 6 days of paying with my card for my falafel, the meany who runs the confusing cash register informed me that the minimum charge for cards is $5. That's fine, but don't tell me when Mr. Meany and I know each other by face and he's well aware that I've been paying with my card for over a week straight. POST IT IF YOU'VE GOT A MINIMUM CHARGE FOR CARDS! Grrr! Very annoying. Since I rarely carry cash and keep better track of my spending using my debit card and online banking, this is a particularly big deal for me.

My husband thought his sandwich was too salty as well.  Also the falafel was crunchy on the outside, not a good crunchy, an over cooked tough crunchy. Not my thing. I also ordered the lentil soup with red lentils and red bell peppers etc. What I opened up looked and tasted like pea soup. It was good, don't get me wrong, but I saw no whole lentils, no red pepper and it was green. I could be way off, but that didn't seem right to me! But you can't beat the prices, 3 dollars for a large soup, sandwiches from 3 to 5 dollars, the most expensive thing was 7 dollars!
