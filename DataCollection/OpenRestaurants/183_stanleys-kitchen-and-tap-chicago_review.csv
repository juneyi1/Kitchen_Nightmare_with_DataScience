2017-07-30,1.0,"This is, perhaps, the saddest review I've ever written.  I have spent the better part of the last 15 summers in Chicago.  SKT has always been a favorite hang of mine.  It's always had a great atmosphere combined with varied, well-prepared, and yummy comfort food.  Unfort., over the past several years, SKT has declined --most noticeably, their menu offerings and service have suffered greatly.  Today marks my last visit there.  I went for the Sunday brunch - - a holdover feature from their better days.   My experience was wretched.  I waited 10 mins. at the restaurant's entrance to speak to someone/anyone.  There was no one at the host's station...no one manning the adjacent bar.  I then approached two workers manning the buffet station, and they simply shrugged their shoulders and directed me back to the vacant host station.   After I was finally seated, I made my way to the buffet spread, for which I had nothing but fond memories.  What a disappointment.  Most of the buffet items had congealed and/or become lukewarm (it was at the height of the Sunday brunch period!).  Also, staple brunch items like eggs and hashbrowns needed to be replenished, yet the staff failed to do so during my entire stay.   Then I had to wait nearly 15 mins to track down my server for a fresh plate, as she was completely occupied conversing with a group of women two tables away from me.  I waited another 15 mins. for the check, but was unable to pry my server away from her conversation at this other table, so I approached the bartender and asked if I could pay at the bar.  Now, the piece de resistance:  I recognized the bartender from my visits over the years, and I told him how disappointed I was in every aspect of my meal there.  He responded by saying: ""mmhmmm--- are you going to pay with cash or card?""   Folks, perhaps this review isn't even necessary as this place is likely to be defunct in the near future, given its precipitous slide.... but the bartender's reaction spoke volumes---they do not give a s**t.  Stanley's has become a watering hole for recent college bros and their dates.  It is now a gloried dive that used to serve really good food.  Unless you want to get sloppily drunk while watching a Bears game, I strongly suggest you avoid this place.",-0.2873,0.846,0.078,0.076,0.48199112978524744
2017-06-20,4.0,"We made sure to visit Stanley's when in Chicago recently after I had read about it when one of the owners passed away. We are really glad we stopped in! In fact, we ended up going there twice!  The first time we went it was just me and my husband. We sat at the bar during trivia night so there were some drink specials that we took advantage of. We also ate dinner there - salad for me, sliders for my husband. We also shared a side of their ""famous"" mac 'n cheese"" (a generous portion, very rich and delicious comfort food).  The second time we took our teens and sat at a table. My daughter had a cinnamon shake that she liked so much there was nothing left for me to taste! My husband and I just had a couple beers.  The staff both times were very friendly and accommodating. If we get back to Chicago, we will definitely make another stop at Stanley's.",0.9808,0.784,0.183,0.033,0.5426587301587302

2017-05-19,5.0,"Stanley's has always been one of my favorite restaurants. In 2014, I wrote that Stanley's has everything a good restaurant should have. First and foremost is the food. We often hear about comfort food. Stanley's is comfort food! They are best known for their fried chicken. It is wonderful. The chicken is fresh and delicious. Best of all, it isn't greasy. They also excel at all of the other comfort mainstays, corn bread, biscuits and honey, mac 'n cheese, meatloaf, cole slaw, and cheese grits. They have a varied menu, and there is probably nobody in the city or surrounding areas who can't find something there to eat. Their desserts are also great. Now for my 2017 review. Stanley's is amazing! My family and my friend and her family were looking for a new place for Mothers' Day brunch. Our usual place has become rather expensive. I thought of Stanley's and remembered that I love their brunch. When I called and spoke to Randy, the manager, she was as nice as can be. She told me that the price would be $14.95 per person, which to me was amazing for their great buffet. I told her that we would be a party of nine, and that I had suffered a heart attack a couple of weeks before. Although they don't take reservations, she said that she would hold a table for me. When I called the day before to confirm, she said that she would hold her parking space for me. Is that incredible customer service, or what??  The buffet was absolutely wonderful; everything was fresh and delicious. There were lots of healthy choices for me, such as fruits and vegetables, cereal, and healthy omelettes, aside from all of the items that I love, such as their amazing fried chicken, mac 'n cheese, and cheese grits. Our server was great. She came over and told us that it wasn't $14.95 for moms that day, that it was half price, $7.50, including a free mimosa! I said that was ridiculous, and she stated that we have to honor our moms!! I hope Stanley's never changes. In a city where restaurants constantly  come and go, it is among the best in Chicago for food, service and value. Long live Stanley's!",0.9986,0.729,0.251,0.02,0.6593045843045844
2017-03-27,4.0,"Absolutely will come back. Our waitress (Rebecca) was FANTASTIC. The buffet is really good. I mean, who doesn't love AYCE for $15? The Mac & Cheese was delicious (I normally am incredibly underwhelmed by most restaurant M&C). The waffles were super tasty (though I wish the fruit was warmed instead of cold). The chorizo & egg scramble was great. I love having mashed potatoes for breakfast & the gravy was so flavorful. I didn't need salt or pepper on anything which is really saying something. I will say that when I called ahead to find out if they required reservations the guy who answered the phone was rude. I also think it might be helpful to have signs directing the flow of traffic, just because some people seemed determined to go against the grain.

Most dishes at a brunch restaurant are already over $12 so the fact that you can eat endlessly here for under $20 is amazing. Beverages are not included in this price! I must've been dreaming too large thinking that bottomless mimosas were part of this deal... This place has a very home-y feel. It's definitely not what I expected it to be because it's also a bar! I think also we have a tendency to imagine buffet places to look some type of way, but this completely throws that image out the window. I don't mind though because it has a very mom-n-pop shop type of feel! It was a very casual atmosphere. There are different stations set up so you don't have to wait in one long line for the food. You can customize your own omelette and have it made right before your eyes. They have AMAZING fried chicken and mac and cheese here! They also make the waffles as people come in, so it's very fresh and crunchy! There's also a bagel bar, cereal, fruits, and other baked goods. The service is really great here. They put a pitcher of water at our table. They were also very quick to take away our plates and provide us with new ones. They are not greedy on their napkins (which are of high quality by the way). They also allowed us to split the check with 5 different cards, which is something that I definitely appreciated.  Parking was easy to find around the neighborhood too!

And the band sounds good, but I came here for karaoke, not for XYZ bands Sunday night showcase. The only singers you could here were from the band, not the karaoke singer. They had the songs up on the screens like a typical karaoke bar, as opposed to the old way with sheet music in front of you since it was Live Band and not just standard stuff. Major downgrade.  Then instead of lots of people up and singing the band just played and performed all their own stuff, featuring just them. Which, again, they sounded good but that's not why we came. This isn't suppose to be a concert. It's karaoke.  The entire vibe and experience there jade changed and personally I won't go back.  If the old band and the old format returns please let me know, that was always an amazing time! But this new band and new vibe is just any random sing-along bar in the city and doesn't make it special enough to venture out on a Sunday night and show the place off to friends.

Not exactly what we brought friends to the bar for. Then when it finally starts it isn't karaoke, it's just the band playing.

2016-06-16,1.0,"My husband and I moved to Chicago a few weeks ago and have been looking for good places to eat.  While we were out walking around the area, we decided to stop at Stanley's Kitchen & Tap due to the good reviews of the Stan Burger. Unfortunately, my husband and I will most likely never stop at this place again. My husband had asked for a specific beer on tap. In response the bartender (who I am assuming was the owner) stated ""no we don't have that, but we have this.""  He then walked away and poured the beer before my husband could even respond. Needless to say, the beer that the bartender chose for my husband would not have been a beer that he would have asked for had he been given the chance.  I then asked for a bloody mary.  Rather than paying an extra $2.50 for their bloody mary bar, I opted to have the bartender make the bloody mary.  After all, a boody mary is one the most popular drinks in America, and every bartender should be able to make a good bloody mary at any chance.  I can honestly say that the bloody mary he gave me was the 2nd worst bloody mary I have ever had in my life (and I have had many bloody marys in many different places).  It was nothing but vodka and straight tomato juice (with 1 splash of tabasco and 1 splash of Worcestershire - not even enough to give any flavor).  He had Zing Zang bloody mary mix sitting right next to the tomato juice and didn't use it. On top of that, when I ask for a bloody mary without specifying vodka brand, I expect to be given rail vodka.  While watching him make the drink, I was surprised to see that they were using a call brand vodka rather than the cheap rail vodka I normally see. However, when I got the bill I saw that I was charged for the call brand vodka rather than the rail vodka I was expecting. So they give you an upgraded vodka without you asking just so they can upcharge you.  Not to mention that the bartender (again, who I assume is the owner) had very poor people skills and made the experience less than pleasant.  Even the waitresses who came up for drink orders seemed irritated and like they didn't want to be there. On top of the horrible service, I watched the bartender put his finger under the Guinness tap waiting for his bar back to change the keg.  He had the Guinness dripping on his finger with someone's half poured Guinness pint right underneath him, so the Guinness was then dripping from his finger into the glass.  And might I say, I never saw him wash his hands once while we were there - even after touching money. I will say that the Stan Burger was great. It is a shame that the horrible bar service will keep us from returning to this establishment.",-0.9857,0.791,0.078,0.131,0.6265922619047618

I liked the lay-out and atmosphere of the place right away.  The bar was what you saw first, but the actual restaurant was through the bar and an open doorway, so it was a bit removed and it wasn't as loud.  We could still hear people singing along to the music in the bar, but surprisingly was not as bad as initially thought.  They had all the tv's in the restaurant area tuned to sports and it seemed like every seat had a view of at least 1 tv. The overall 'con' of the place was the service.  Our waitress seemed nice enough, but did not check on us after the initial check-in after the food was delivered.  My cousin discovered halfway through the meal that most of her sweet potato chips were either burnt or raw and was disappointed that the waitress never came back so she could get new ones made.  She also brought us the wrong tables beer at first and did not remember anybody's beer or food order (put them in front of the wrong people). I did enjoy my ginger peach cider (except for the price--forgot Chicago alcohol prices would be steeper than Madison's!) and I REALLY enjoyed my catfish po' boy.  The bread on the sandwich was crusty and toasty, the fish was done well, the sirachi mayo was great and the thin, crispy fries were the perfect finish.   Husband ordered 'God's Mac n' Cheese' and liked it, but I wasn't a fan.  It looked like it came straight out of a pre-made casserole (brick of mac n cheese) and was just warmed up.  It did have real cheese on it which was a nice touch.

At that point it was now too crowded to enjoy.  They didn't have the dining area open so it was elbow to elbow.  The burgers hadn't come yet and time was running out.  We hadn't seen our waitress anymore as she was serving the over crowed bar.  The cook came out and served our burgers.   They get 3 stars for the burger.  It was juicy ande the shoe string fries were good.  My son thought that it was just another burger.  I took away points for the over crowded. Come to find out it was a tour bus that dropped them off, and supposedly management knew but didn't plan.  I can partially agree, any good tour group always plans ahead....unless it wasn't a good tour company.  It would also be possible that management didn't staff accordingly thinking it was just a Thursday and present staff should deal with it.

2014-12-13,3.0,"So my husband and two friends went here after seeing the zoo lights. A friend had told us that the place had good food so we decided to give it a try. When we came in it is was packed. We would told the wait would be 40 mins so we looked for a place to hang out until then. This nice older gentleman found us a table so we were able to enjoy the Hawks, have a few drinks (mind you I am pregnant and my drinks are root beers) and order food.  Our waitress did come up right after we were seated and asked us for our drink order. We got the first round and then ordered our food. That is were the good service ended.  First we were told that they ran out of Mac and Cheese. I will be honest, I have limited waitressing experience but I am confused as to how you run out of pasta and cheese.  When I saw this on the menu I was super excited and was disappointed to not get a chance to try it. They were also out of a beer that one of my friends wanted. But I will say that this wasn't the reason for the low rating. It was the lack of service that was our real problem.  Our waitress disappeared for the next 20-30 mins. By this time everyone at the table had finished their drinks and were thirsty for more drinks. It was so long that I finally asked the hostess were our waitress was at and was told she was getting food from the kitchen. And that another table had asked the same thing.  We were told that the kitchen was slammed and food was coming out slowly.  If that was the case why was the waitress back there and not serving drinks to keep everyone happy.  The other people at the table enjoy having a few beers and were disappointed that they ended up drinking two after two hours of being at the restaurant. She finally resurfaced and slapped the starters on the table and ran off. We were finally able to order another round of drinks. I then had to ask a few times for my root beer and was told that it was in the back so it would take her some time to get it.  Her attitude was very off putting and made us feel like were imposing on her. We are not picky about much but when one of the people in your party is a former waitress and she was getting pissed there is definitely a service problem.   The other part that was annoying was the super loud music. We were sitting at small round table and struggled to have a conversation because the music was blasting. I get that the younger crowd was coming in but I think that they were even having a hard time hearing. The seats were also uncomfortable with no padding.  Our food finally came after a wait time of somewhere between 45 mins to an hour.  The saving grace was that the food was worth the wait. I had the Chicken Fried Chicken. It was very good and I enjoyed every piece of it. Considering that I have not enjoyed eating any meat during this pregnancy that is saying a lot for me. One of the friends ordered the chicken pot pie. I had a bite of hers and it was also delish.   I hope that maybe this was just an off night because the food is too good to waste at a place with bad service.",0.9757,0.788,0.123,0.089,0.5102498048399688

2014-11-23,2.0,"I have been living across from this place for two years and frequented it for three. I ate the buffets on Sundays, celebrated the Blackhawks winning the cup and had many meals here with my girlfriend mainly because of the convenient location. The food was always half-way decent and the service wasn't amazing but it was my trusty neighborhood Blackhawks bar. For that alone, I would haven given it 4 stars. After a few months away, I was severely disappointed tonight by  horrible service, cold food, piss beer, drunken idiots and football on TV at a bar named after a freaking hockey trophy. If this isnt enough to deter you, read on for my full rant.  My friend and I came in expecting the same old Stanleys and a good crowd of Blackhawks fan wanting to watch the big game vs Vancouver. After five minutes a waitress came up to us, slapped down one food - only menu and asked us what we wanted to drink. After 10 seconds of us looking at the beer taps to see what was new she gave us a dirty look and walked away. Five minutes later she came back and asked if we were ready yet. I asked for a drink menu for any seasonals and got a big ""screw you"" look with a bad beer recommendation. We ordered out of frustration and had her come back only to ask us to repeat our drink orders.  By the time we finally got our piss excuse for a beer it was twenty minutes into the game with all televisions tuned to some out of state football team. When we kindly asked for the TV to change to hockey, we got a short inaudible answer due to the drunken table behind us recreating their college days from ten years ago by screaming along to the music playing in the background. Finally a few tvs were turned on with no sound and the waitress came back and asked if we were ready to order yet. So we ordered, I got another ""screw you"" look when I asked for my burger with no onions and we had our menus yanked away. A minute later while my friend was in the bathroom our waitress came back asking ME what my friend had just ordered. Given I had no idea, I gave it my best guess and he luckily  ended up with the right meal. Long story long, our food surprisingly came out to be the right orders so we ate as fast as we could, asked for our check and ran out wondering what the heck just happened while agreeing our time with our neighborhood hockey bar had come to an end.",-0.0351,0.771,0.113,0.116,0.4640169198992728

I'm not ashamed to say that I polished off the rest of the chicken when I got home. It was good and I like my fried chicken fresh. The atmosphere in the back of the restaurant is very midwest road trip, like you checked in at a truck stop diner on your way through Indiana.

You definitely get the down home feel here as there's nothing remotely upscale about the place but they make up for the aesthetic by whipping up some great southern dishes in the kitchen!  Obviously I came for the fried chicken... which was really good. Tasted like my mom or grandmothers home cooking! They also bring you a plate of corn bread muffins  and hush puppies to pre-fatten you up before your meal. The cheese grits were really yummy and a definite must try! One of my friends had a massive pulled pork sandwich.  I don't eat a lot of pork but he said it was good. My other friend had the fried catfish which was disappointing after being comforted by the fried chicken. They really missed the mark with the batter used on the fish... I found our server to be a little too snippy to be working in the service industry where you rely on tips..luckily I was so happy with my meal that I didn't hold it against her.

Perhaps we should start grooving in some neighborhood bars to save our bank! I think we got what we paid for. It's not fair to expect an $10 entree to hold up to our customary $25 entree, right?

Moving inside you will find yourself in the bar area and then venturing back even further will land you in a very homey, comfy dining area.  The menu is amazing! It was so hard to make a selection from the southern comfort food options. The meal started with hush puppies and cornbread muffins served with Apple butter, which was a heavenly combination of flavors.  I decided to eat two appetizers, both of which I enjoyed. Definitely try the fried pickles because they are huge! The okra that accompanied them were not as amazing...which is to be expected of okra, in my opinion. The sweet potato chips: also a big hit. Mac and cheese, fried chicken salad and chocolate shake: also thoroughly enjoyed.  Our waitress (sorry no name drop) was super friendly and funny which added to the overall experience at Stanley's.  The takeaway is that we totally missed out on the brunch buffet that happens sat & sun with a Bloody Mary bar...we were an hour late. *tear* But then again there is a special of some kind offered each night so make sure to hit up the ones that appeal to your tastebuds the most.

The unfortunate thing is, I am the type of person who ALWAYS recommends a venue or a vendor if they produce great results.  I would have been more than happy to refer Stanley's to my friends and colleagues for parties but instead, because of the poor quality of the management and staff, I am here writing this negative review to warn other people about having parties here.  I cannot recommend Stanley's to anyone.",-0.8564,0.768,0.109,0.123,0.5269632414369257

We went back - made sure no Chicago sports teams were playing - and had an amazing dinner in the dining area (which is separated from the bar). Monday's special is build-your-own burgers, an option which a lot of the other diners seemed to go for. However, since neither of us eat burgers, it didn't appeal to us - even though they offer turkey burger and chicken breast as alternate options. My boyfriend got a triple decker grilled cheese (which in my opinion looked pretty pedestrian, but which he enjoyed). I got the mac and cheese appetizer (which was enormous and delicious) and the pulled pork sandwich, which came with an apple slaw. The pulled pork was enormous and really really good - the best I've had outside of Memphis. *Disclaimer - we ordered this much food because we were trying to use a $30 Groupon* The meal ended up coming to 30.77 with tax (we got a beer to push it over the edge) so we got amazing value (even if we hadn't used a groupon) for the meal. We ended up taking the mac and cheese to go since it was too much to eat there. Would definitely recommend for families or couples.

My wife and I met a group of friends here yesterday (Friday, 12/6/13) and we got a great server at our table near the bar. She was very attentive and had a great attitude. Then enter douchebag bartender. A couple of us go to the bar and order a round of shots. Everything still ok. Then we order a couple gin and sodas. He hands us 2 huge glasses. We take a sip and it tastes like pure soda - of course it would with the % mix of liquor to mixer. I get his attention and politely say ""Excuse me, sir. We just ordered these 2 drinks. I wasn't aware they came in such big glasses. Would you mind remaking them in a smaller glass?"". His response is defensive and rude. ""Why didn't you order it in a small glass?"". I respond back ""Well, typically when you order a drink as common as a gin + soda, you don't have to specify a small glass vs. a tall glass"". He comes back with, ""Well, that's just how we make our drinks. There's still the right amount of liquor in there."" I say ""I'm not arguing that. I'm sure there is. I'm telling you there is too much mixer in here. Basically, the drink doesn't taste good and I'd like you to make me another one."" Then he gets fired up. ""Well, I can pour this into a small glass (I'm thinking to myself, a lot of good that'll do dummy). Or I can make it a double. But I'm not remaking your drink. I'm not giving you anything for free."" I was infuriated. I cut it off and asked to speak to his manager. He YELLS across the bar ""Ohhhh, he wants to talk to the manager! Hey Manager! I got a guy here that wants to talk to you!"" Ridiculous. The manager comes over, at least with a normal tone, but condescending. I explain the situation calmly. He gives me the same thing ""That's how we make our drinks. I'll have them remake it for you, but this is a one time thing. Now you know for going forward"". Am I in the twilight zone?! The 2 drinks are delivered to us rudely, but at least now it tastes like a standard gin and soda. I hope the owner reads this so he/she realizes the type of unprofessional behavior happening in his establishment - and makes a change. It's unacceptable.

We already had reservations to go to RPM that night, and we sure as hell weren't missing those so something had to be done in the way of healing. As soon as I walked in, I could already feel the pounding in my head dissipating.  The buffet was a site for sore eyes - fried chicken, mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs, egg casserole, omelet station, GRAVY, anything you could ever want as a hungover adult, or a hungry adult for that matter. THEN they ask you if you want to make your own bloody mary and hand you a damn vase if you comply. HOLY HELL was that experience heavenly. So many options of ingredients and you just want to have them all...its so hard to tell yourself, ""I know there's 13 kinds of hot sauce and it sounds like an epic idea to add them all to your bloody mary, but kindly, put down the bottles. Let's not get carried away, crazy."" The best thing is after you eat your weight in fried chicken and eggs, you have a bit of a hike to the subway to work it off. My advice to you, fellow Yelpers, is this: do not be lead astray by the doubters of this place, TRUST ME.

We opted to sit outside because it was a nice day, and we were told by the hostesses that we could just find a seat in one of two outdoor patio areas and a server would be along shortly.  The patios had a wall on one side keeping them separate from the sidewalk, but making them really awkward to get in and out of.  Since you have to use the public sidewalk to get in and out of the restaurant, this made things a bit difficult--particularly when a bunch of people with large dogs showed up and basically blocked the path.  I guess it was worse for the server because she kept having to dodge these hazards, but my trip to the bathroom involved a lot more space negotiation than I've encountered before. She came back for our order, and we got beer, Redneck Poutine appetizer, a Pressed New Orleans Muffaletta for BF and a Pressed Tomato, Basil and Mozzarella for me.  While we were waiting for the food, she came back to ask if we wanted more drinks, which we did, but she had taken the beer list.  She went back inside to get it, brought it back, we decided, and then she took it again!  Do they only have one list for the whole restaurant?  We were visiting Chicago, and wanted to sample as many new beers as possible, but we barely had a moment with the list before she just snatched it away.  Considering it took her at least 45 seconds to get in and out of the restaurant, I would have thought she'd like to save herself a trip, but what do I know.  The poutine was good, but certainly not amazing.  It was just tots and gravy, no cheese curds.  Is southern poutine different than Canadian poutine?  Since I'm not really a connoisseur of poutine, I can't have too many opinions of this stuff, but I will say I was disappointed. Not as disappointed as I was with my sandwich though.  Pressed Tomato, Basil and Mozzarella, has no basil, apparently.  It was just dull and the tomatoes were watery and hard.  The sweet potato chips were pretty meh, but I did enjoy BF's mashed potatoes--though I suspect I got to enjoy them so much because he didn't. Overall, just an awkward and forgettable dinner.  If any of this restaurant's servers read this: LEAVE THE BEER LIST, it makes life easier for all involved.",-0.3896,0.819,0.083,0.098,0.4828291627072114

I've been to this buffets 3 times in this lifetime and hope I can make it for more. The dining area is super kitschy and cute! Feels like you are dining in some old southern house. I LOVE IT! Yeah, ok, the wait staff has been on the slow side sometimes, but they make up for it with the amazing food. I've always wanted to try their bloody mary buffet too!  Parking is actually not too bad considering it's in the heart of Lincoln park (near the zoo). I don' think I've ever had to wait for seating either. I've come during the evening and at their peak time on the weekends.  The last thing that tops off this fine establishment with their 5th and well deserved star.....drum roll please???!?!?................ LIVE BAND KARAOKE!!!! Sunday Nights. Get there early enough to get a song in because no matter where you are, live band karaoke is more cut throat than normal karaoke.

That plus the totally uncomfortable chairs and shot glasses of water = no thanks.  And, we were in the back by the coloring contest wall - I have to wonder whether parents are really okay with their kids putting their phone numbers on the wall of a public place??  Not a good idea.",0.7391,0.78,0.122,0.099,0.487719298245614

We weren't offered any appetizers or additional bread baskets to tide us over. At one point our waitress disappeared in the kitchen for well over 30 minutes. When our food finally did come they charged us for items we never received. A lot of the food was cold (meaning it had been sitting back there for a while) one of our diners had tin foil stuck all over the panini making it completely inedible. They offered to comp our drinks (water and iced tea) and give us 10% off. The meal should have been entirely free. Eventually they gave us 50% and offered ice cream to go. No thanks.

Arrived at 5:50 pm, and although my party of 5 was seated right away, we didn't get our food until 90 minutes later.  90 minutes!  We were told by our very nice waitress that our order had somehow not made it into the system, and then had inadvertently been cancelled.  I was not encouraged when a woman next to us (their table had been waiting a long time also) bit into her sandwich, shrieked, and pulled out a large piece of tinfoil stuck to the bottom of the meat.  Yikes!  I think she got comped, and rightly so. Finally, when we were literally faint from hunger, four of our dinners at long last arrived (one with cold mashed potatoes but at that point we'd have eaten anything)...mine did not, for probably another five minutes or so.  So my famished fellow diners got a head start on me.  Once my meal eventually arrived, I got maybe halfway through it before I turned my head to take a drink...and discovered that the waitress clearing the other dishes had removed it! Yes, they comped our drinks and desserts (suggestion: when you are packing apple pie for carryout, do NOT make it ala mode! Talk about a congealed mess) and took 50% off our bill, but that was completely ridiculous!  The waitress urged me to come back and she would ""make it right.""  She couldn't have been sweeter, but I'm not sure what anyone could possibly do to ""make it right"" after an experience like that. I'm beyond sad.  I ate here often when I lived in the neighborhood and loved this place.  I don't think I could bring myself to bring friends here after this.  I guess next time we'll stick to the Subway across the street.",0.8413,0.883,0.066,0.051,0.5409247757073845

The prices were great, it seems like the kind of bar you would go to if you wanted to have a good time watching sports. The only downside to the place was the size, being on a one of those corners where shaped like acute triangles the place is oddly shaped and can get pretty crowded toward the bar.  Other than that great place to get some serious southern food.

Right from the get-go, the server came over (it was between the brunch/lunch shift change and no one seemed to care we were there) and seemed to be stoned out of his mind. He blurted out something that resembled ""get cha' drinks?"" but I couldn't really tell. I stuck to water. I split a chicken dinner with my girlfriend after not having anything really particularly interesting on the menu. We ordered it because it was big enough and it seems like a Southern restaurant. The chicken took about 30 mins to cook, which is fine, but it took the server until 25 minutes into that period to come over and say ""I forgot to tell you, the chicken takes a while to cook.""   The chicken tasted like pure vegetable oil. Absolutely no taste to it at all. Then, right behind us we heard our same waiter give a speech to the newly sat table about their specials that he did not tell us about that all 4 grilled cheese sandwiches that all sounded awesome.  He then brought out beverages, soups, and an appetizer to the table behind us before he came to collect our bill. Dear Stanley's...FAIL. Big fail.

We asked her about drink specials and she pointed out the bloody mary bar:  For $9, they give you a huge cup filled with ice and three shots of vodka. Then you can go over and choose from a vast array of mixes, hot sauces, fresh veggies, cheeses, and seasonings. Yummy.  Also, everyday they have $6 peach Stoli and sweet tea (Texas tea). Super yummy.  On Saturdays and Sundays they have a brunch buffet from 10am-4pm. It's $12.99. We decided to do the buffet, and I'm glad we did. It was awesome. Omelet bar, waffles, bagels, grits, fruit, fried chicken, salad, mac n'cheese, potato hash, mashed potatoes, and biscuits n' gravy. (I wish that there were more veggies on the buffet though, and maybe some creamed corn!) The mac n' cheese was good, but the biscuit's n' gravy were some of the best I've ever had!

A friend of mine does a set at the Monday night stand-up show, Speak Easy Comedy (which I *highly* recommend, BTW), from time to time so I was there to see his set. My boyfriend and I stopped by early to grab dinner and we both took advantage of the $5 build-your-own burger. A cheap dinner for sure, but super slow service (burgers took 30 minutes - huh?), cold food, and a very awkwardly placed table that simultaneously felt like being shoved in a corner and being seated in the center of the room. The awkward table would not have bothered me had the service been better and the food had been hot when it came out to us; but when you combine a totally bland turkey burger, cold fries, waiting 30 minutes for said food, and a waiter that didn't acknowledge how long the food took, it makes for one less than pleasant dining experience. * Plus one star for having Lagunitas IPA on tap. * Plus two more for the comedy, which I definitely would recommend checking out if you've got nothing to do on a Monday night.",0.9917,0.757,0.196,0.046,0.6213425925925927

2012-02-15,3.0,"Overall: 3.5 stars Having lived in the south, I am always amused at other regions' take on southern food and culture, one that usually amounts to little more than stereotypes (for restaurants, think bourbon & beer, butter & cream, and a trailer-park ambiance). Stanley's is to some degree no exception, but it does enough things well to merit a review. The formula here is southern classics in a casual environment (and at reasonable prices). Expect well-executed chicken fried steak, fried chicken, biscuits and gravy, collard greens and the like. Portions are enormous (another false southern stereotype, I might add), examples being the mountain of french fries served in a cone or plate full of crispy fried okra. While I definitely have a spot in my heart for southern comfort food, about once a year is about all the Stanley's my arteries can take. Stanley's also turns into a low-key but lively 80's slanted bar after dinner, even livelier and with a DJ on weekends. On a weekday when things are a bit more mellow, I love this place, but on weekends I'd recommend it more for the single crowd. If you are in need of an ego boost (or perhaps just a good laugh), guy or girl, good looking or not, I can just about guarantee at least one shameless pickup attempt over the course of the night.

In general, Stanley's looks like nothing special from the outside, but once inside, you'll see its history written all over the walls.  No literally.  People have scrawled names, love notes, pictures of male anatomical parts, and the likes all over the interior.  Gotta love a place that is dedicated, quite literally, to its clientele.  Mixed in with the ""art"" are tons of Blackhawks memorabilia (and the players actually visit this place quite frequently). Side Note: I've seen a ton of famous people here too (Kid Rock, Michael Jordan, Styx). The bar is a great time! Always have the game on during the week and on weekends and, when there is nothing playing, the party gets a'hoppin.  Always good tunes and an old-time jukebox is usually in play when the crowd is right.  This place is also known for its Whiskey (boasting something like 60 different kinds) so make sure to get your tasting tongue (and your liver) ready.   The restaurant is in the back and looks like you have stepped into another world.  Mom's downhome kitchen to be more descriptive.  It seriously looks kind of like a cracker barrel back there but the food is way better! Everything is good but try the pulled pork, andouille sausage corn dogs, fried chicken, shoe-string fries, mac & cheese. BRUNCH:  You wouldn't think it people but this place hosts one of the best brunches in the city.  Just don't count on it lowering your cholesterol.  Served unlimited buffet style, count on an omelette bar, biscuits and gravy, BACON, bagels & lox, eggs, and of course their infamous fried chicken.  Yum! Not to mention the Bloody Mary bar that stretches about 7 feet with all the accoutrements.  One of these things and you are ready to party!  Good thing too because Sunday night is all about the Live Band Karaoke!  So much fun but very crowded.

My first mistake was not getting a beer.  I went with the special - a pink vodka lemonade.  Meh.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  I was expecting a little something with more tang, I guess. Second, I didn't go with my usual - buffalo chicken tenders with mashed potatoes.  I opted to do the Burger Bar.  The burger was a generous size, but very bland.  A little seasoning to the meat would have been nice.  The topping selections were decent, but I'm conservative and put a few things on my burger - tomato, garlic n' chive mayo (yum), and provolone.  I did have a cup of the tomato basil soup and some salad which was pretty good. The most annoying thing about that evening was the fact that there was only ONE server during a busy Monday Night.  Hellooo...  Um, football season has already started and people in this area actually like to go out to a bar to watch a game.  Our server was nice, but not very fast or efficient.

Discovered the place while bicycling a few weeks ago, and finally tried their Saturday/Sunday brunch this morning.  Got there at 10:15 a.m., just after they opened, and already maybe a quarter of the tables were occupied. What a selection!!  Eggs, bacon, sausage, grits, fruit, bagels and lox, chicken a la king, biscuits with gravy, corned beef hash, fried chicken (awesome),waffles (concave in the middle to hold the great toppings), caesar salad, mashed potatoes, bread, cookies, etc., etc.,etc.  There is even a made-to-order omelette station and a bloody mary bar, as well, with huge glasses!! I ate at the bar.  Both the bartender and the buffet server were friendly and conversational.  At about 11:00 a.m., a waiting line began to form, and by the time I left, even the bar area was full.  Ambiance is neighborhood bar/restaurant, and almost all of the patrons this Sunday morning were 20 and 30-somethings, many in Bears regalia.  The layout can make it crowded/busy at times around the buffet. Oh, and the price?  $12.99 for the all-you-can eat brunch.  After a couple of Stellas, and with taxes and tip, my total was just shy of $30.

2011-04-30,4.0,"2As8TFOBBQLOLWTFDILLIGAFFBBQLMNOPEOSXYZYWIA4MP2­NEA* That looked like shit* out Alphabet soup. But encapsulated our experience with efficient brevity. However, for those who don't speak Acronymonium I will write a review, then post the key at the end. There are three great things about Stanley's touched on in reviews: live band karaoke nights, stand up nights, and their brunch. We never experienced them. But they had us at three magic words; Wednesday night special. Barbeque, I think I love you. And cheap too ($10 for choice of BBQ ribs, chicken, beef brisket or BBQ pulled pork sandwich with three sides of your choice). The theme is home cooking and there are signs all over the outside and inside stating that. And if you don't get the hint or can't read the atmosphere reiterates it. The decor is southern hayseed chic. By gum, I felt just like I was in Pappy Cleotus and Auntie Maybelline's kitchen. Shewt! We chose to relax with a drink in the bar before dining. The Wednesday drink special was a beer boot but my partner got 312 bottles and I got Texas Tea for the evening. The Texas Tea was wonderful. It was peach flavored liquer and tea flavored liquor served in a mason jar with orange slice, lemon slice, springs of fresh mint, and a bendy straw. Cute and yummy! We adjourned to the dining room. Right away they brought complimentary corn muffins and hush puppies. Both were a little bland. I think corn muffins or corn bread tastes better infused with flavor like with cheddar and jalepenos and both the muffins and puppies might have tasted better with dash of onion in dough. However, it's a blessing in disguise since the came with a multi-fruit jam so probably needed a mild base.  We ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich, mashed potatoes with gravy, mac n cheese, cheesy grits and added for $2.50 cole slaw to split. For two it was a lot of food! But we ate it all. We're like Honey Badgers, when we are hungry we just take what we want and don't give a shit! It was pretty good. Definitely better than mice or cobras. The BBQ pork was of a decent quality, it could have had more sauce with a tangier or more complex seasoning. The bun held up well under the large amount of dressed meat. The mac n cheese was rich, but good. We both felt the cheesy grits were the best side.  I'd go again and update my review with some of those three things other Yelpers recommended and promise my intro won't look like I sat on my keyboard. *If you're reading this Pappy Cleotus and Aunt Maybelline it's text speak people do on those newfangled phones with out a cord or a rotary dial.

I was a little wary of it having bacon in it from the description (bacon is usually such a cop out to improve a dish IMO), but it was nice, not overpowering at all. The mashed potatoes are way too salty and don't taste homemade at all to me.  Liked the Texas tea, bit sweet, but one would suffice. Oh also it's not Texas Tea.

I went back again three nights later for dinner. This time I ordered Chicken Fried Steak...so delicious!!! And I LOVE LOVE LOVE the hushpuppies they serve with every meal.

The house packed up a bit later with a mix of mostly folks in their 20s with some in their 30s and 40s sprinkled in.  I saw a half dozen people I've been crossing paths with for years.  The eye candy was off the charts but mostly way too young for our crew.  We're not manthers, but there were quite a few in the house.  They're good for laughs, but they're simultaneously revolting when they try to hit on women half their age.  Really, dude?  No, she doesn't want any candy, a Miller Lite or you.   Anyway, you know what Stanley's is.  It's small, relaxed and friendly.  There are smiling faces aplenty and not much attitude (except for me, natch).   We ended up closing the place down on Super Bowl Sunday.  Nice little find by The Weatherman.  We'll be back at some point surely, whether for general carousing or Sunday karaoke band.

Well, they definitely had seating.  Thank god because we needed some food and beer!  I was intrigued by the menu, and ordered the andouille mini corn dogs and gorgonzola stuffed bacon wrapped dates.   I was so intrigued by the mini corn dogs, because I LOVE andouille sausage.  Well, I don't know if corn ""dog"" is the correct description of this item.  I would go with corn BALLS.  I bit into one, and the piece of sausage was just a huge chunk of sausage.  For some reason I was thinking it would be like mini sized, but it was clearly just sliced sausage.  I think it could have gone over better if it had been ground, or cut in half lengthwise before cutting into pieces.  Once I bit in, the entire sausage came out of the breading and I was left with a large piece to eat separately from the breading.  Not really that good. The dates, though, they were yummy!  One of my signature dishes are ricotta stuffed bacon wrapped dates, so I always give that a go if its on a menu.  You should too.  Don't be scared, dates are good, and even better oven baked and wrapped in bacon.   There was some sort of beer special going on, and I went with it, although I don't remember what made it special.  I was just happy to drink some stellas.",0.997,0.773,0.214,0.013,0.5059523809523809

We tried to find another place nearby with not so ridiculous a wait time-the wait was 90-120 minutes and that was BEFORE a huge bus stopped and dropped off a bunch of tourists. Fortunately Yelp mobile helped out with this dilemma and Stanley's was nearby and after calling them their wait time wasn't so bad. We drove the relatively short distance and waited there. We had a party of six so it was a little longer than anticipated but still a far better wait  than the run time of 'Avatar.' The brunch which is all you can eat and $12.99 was bloody delicious. Biscuits and gravy was smooth and delicious, with the gravy sticking out more than biscuit which was still a nice, flaky one. I piled up on sausage, bacon and eggs which were all good it's hard to screw up breakfast staples like that though. My next plate I got an omelette from the omelette station, with ham and all the veggies: onions, mushrooms, tomato and peppers. A pretty good mix, a little bit watery but still good/ The mashed potatoes were a little grainy and it seemed like the home made mashed potatoes were not so home made.The fruit platter was pretty fresh and a good mix. My third plate-yes that's right my THIRD plate involved a little waffle, which was long and hollow in the middle that had space for the whipped cream. I was not so impressed with it the berries didn't seem to have any flavor at all nor did the whipped cream. HOWEVER, the fried chicken they had was delicious! moist and juicy on the inside crispy and oh so spiced on the out. The mac and cheese was also a plus-it was a great side that I should have picked twice instead of having the mashed potatoes. Our server was okay, she was a little rushed at first when it was really busy but seemed a little perplexed with splitting the check. I mean, with six people it should be a bit expected, especially since the crowd had died down when we finished. Other than that, a good brunch place.

I order the half fried chicken, JL got the chicken fried chicken. We got a side of mac and cheese to start, and finished off with apple pie ala mode with cinnamon ice cream. My friend chicken was awesome. I mean, bits of the skin tasted like potato chips. The meat was super juicy and steaming hot. I only had a leg and a breast and I was amazed at how they skin was so crispy and managed to stay that way while encasing the super moist white meat. Is this starting to sound weird? And I'm doing it. I'm saying that it's the best fried chicken I've ever had. Ever.  Anyway, the mac and cheese was just okay to me, because I lost interest after it got cold. The apple pie was good, but the pie crust could've been crispier. The sliced apples inside were good though. Overall atmosphere was that of a college bar, with games on all the TVs.

Stanley's is another neighborhood bar, but converts itself into a brunch bar on weekend mornings.  It's an interesting place that's one half bar and one half restaurant in the shape of a house.  There's plenty of space, but expect lines depending on the time and date. They have a really nice Bloody Mary bar set up, where you can make it anyway you like.  Since most people have preferences on this, it's a nice draw for those early morning pick-me-ups.  The food is decent, with their famous mac-n-cheese and fried chicken.  Plus regular sides like waffles, bacon, etc.  There's also great cookies and fruit trays. Why only 3?  Well, it's expensive and really not a whole lot of food to chose from.  Plus, it's a little inconsistant in quality, not ever bad, but I've had some bland dishes at times.  When it's good though, it is some killer fried chicken. Stanley's is a decent brunch place.  I know there are some people who REALLY like it, and I can see why.  It's tasty and has a style that's unique in the area.  It's actually not a bad place if you have kids, as the ""house"" seating could get them going.  Plus, what kid doesnt love mac-n-cheese for breakfast?   However if you're looking for brunch, there are other places in walking distance that are cheaper and more about the food than bar.",0.9796,0.804,0.144,0.051,0.6278418803418803

This place looked cute, and as it happened, an actor my friends recognized from TV was walking out the door as we were heading in. In an attempt to have a nonchalant celebrity encounter, my friend asked the guy if this place was any good -- ""Best in Chicago,"" he said. This guy plays a doctor on TV, so we had little choice but to take his word.   The place was pretty chill inside -- it could be described, perhaps, as a little bit folksy, a little bit divey. We liked it right away, and found lots of tasty things on the menu. The food did not disappoint.  The service, however, was a disaster, especially considering how not busy it was at the time. The guy that brought the food didn't know which burger was which, and just stood there petrified when we asked. I mean deer-in-headlights petrified. Our waitress made a total of two, maybe three appearances at the table; there was no hope in flagging her down to shed light on the burger situation, as she was altogether MIA. God forbid we should want drink refills. Or ketchup. Or silverware. Or the bill. That said, we really did like the food, and the place seemed cool. I'd be perfectly willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and just assume we were there at sort of an awkward time just a bit after a reasonable lunch hour, and I wouldn't be opposed to giving them a second chance... ...with one caveat: I'm not going back until they do something about the homophobic graffiti near the entrance to the mens room.

Our service was pretty bad, there were many 10 other people in the restaurant total but we only saw our waiter 3 times. We had to flag others down for plates, drink refills and even our check.

Last night I went to Stanley's with a friend and made the mistake of tasting a bit of his side of Macaroni and Cheese. I don't know what it said about this on the menu but it seemed to have three different kinds of cheese in it and was topped with some broiled cheddar. Holy mother of Wisconsin I was reaching ac cross the table for another and another and another.... Then he put the plate in front of me and I had to call the waitress to take it away. I ordered the fried chicken chopped salad and asked for the dressing to be light. I know, I know, fried chicken...light dressing. I picked as much of the fried chicken out as I could resist. The salad was decent. My friend ordered the fried chicken and mashed potatoes along with a side of corn and mac n cheese. He's a big guy and can eat a lot but didn't finish all that was served him. The portions are gigantic. So big that if I ever return I'll need to split a dish with someone. He raves about the fried chicken there, I tried a bite and really wasn't all that impressed. I dunno. I had a vodka tonic that got me buzzed in less than five minutes. I'm a lightweight but still, that was fast! We ate in the bar area which is pretty cramped. I had to carefully weave in and out of chairs to get to the bathroom as we had a center pub table. There are a lot of large screen TVs broadcasting sports so if you wanna catch a game while you eat you can. Our server was really sweet and attentive. She took care of a mix up on my friend's order right away. The bathroom had an interesting chalkboard that read, ""Your worst boyfriend ever"" and lines below to write in names but no chalk.

A few pieces of fried chicken, a waffle or two, some eggs, and a full stomach later, she is ready to come give it another whirl the next time she's in Chicago. While I've  been a Stanley's fan for dinner for almost five years now, only in the past year did we enjoy the deliciousness of Stanley's brunch!  Crispy fried chicken, freshly made waffle boats (which with whip cream and fruit, makes an excellent dessert), smooth mac and cheese, and hit or miss biscuits... this has become one of my favorite brunch places to take my out of town and in town friends.   Even though the biscuits are hit/miss, the misses are still tasty.. just not as ""superb"" as when they really have the recipe down right and the moistness if perfect with some homemade gravy. Want fruit and cold cuts?  They have those too!  Also someone to help make omelletes to order!  Make sure to come early as the fruit disappears quickly and is replaced slower than the fried chicken/waffles, the pride and joy of Stanleys...  I think there even comes a point where they just stop replacing the fruit, as we waited for about 30 minutes and the empty plate just stayed. If you're lucky enough, on your way out, make sure you grab one of their chocolate chip cookies... it's prolly the final bite that will send you to your slumber, but still a great way to end the meal.

2007-11-09,3.0,I had brunch here on a crowded Sunday morning. Everything was good - but that's about it. Nothing to write home about.

2007-10-21,3.0,"Bumped into this place by accident. We were suppose to go somewhere else for breakfast but it was closed today. Driving around for a period of time right before my son would have had a meltdown, we found Stanley's.  It's the neighborhood dive/diner and on Sundays they have a brunch.   For 11.95 excluding beverages, you get the typical American breakfast plus macaroni & cheese, smoked ham, and fried chicken. The biscuits were pretty good and they also have made to order omelettes. We were seated quickly (it was around 10:15am), the waitress was nice and the atmosphere was family friendly (everyone from the neighborhood seemed to be there excluding us).  If you are in the area on Sunday and you're starving for breakfast, might as well go there especially for the price.",0.9331,0.831,0.129,0.04,0.6077922077922078
2007-09-23,1.0,"Um, no. You know a place is bad when you gear yourself up for the worst and it far exceeds your lousy expectations. I resigned myself to the fact that it's in Lincoln Park and the photos of the people on the website are all of 20-something Trixies and Chads and/or 30- or 40-somethings who think that wearing winter hats indoors somehow disguises their age and erases the fact that they need to grow the hell up already. A friend told me a while back: ""Going to Stanley's for Sunday brunch is like going to a frat party, waking up after passing out there and being forced to stay and eat room-temperature sausage when you wake."" That person was a true friend, and I'm ashamed to have ignored such an astute warning. That said, I will admit that the clientele was not really the problem. Some of the friendliest ex-frat boys I've encountered in my many years as a reluctant LP resident, in fact. The absolutely cold food from the buffet, however, was the problem. Yes, the spread was chock-full of hearty ""hangover"" food, but I was hard-pressed to find any item that was hot except for the English muffin I toasted myself. And this supposedly ""delicious"" macaroni and cheese? Inedible. Call me crazy if you must, but I don't expect bleu cheese (which I generally like) in my macaroni and cheese and, even if I did, I would never expect that much. Nor would I predict it to be served 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Way to ruin the only thing I was looking forward to. And what is up with those soggy maxi-pad-shaped waffles? Granted, I'm not a fan of buffet-style brunches to begin with, but this was exceptionally bad. I'll never understand why people think $11.95 (which is really about $20 once you figure in beverages and tip) is a good deal for food simply because it's ""all you can eat."" In a country where standard portions at non-""all you can eat"" restaurants with made-to-order food are about triple what they should logically be, does anyone ever leave a restaurant hungry and wanting more? I don't, and I'm a compulsive eater! Had my friends not picked this as a meeting place, I would have gladly gone to any other nearby restaurant and ordered a real breakfast or lunch that was hot, tasty and more reasonably priced. In the interest of saying something positive: There's a cute painted bench in front of the restaurant and bus stop that makes your inexplicable wait slightly less annoying.",0.5283,0.798,0.099,0.102,0.5723674973674974

First off I like that it runs later than some other brunches so if I'm not feeling so hot after a night out I know I can mosey in at my own pace. Plus the later you go the less wait you have. I also really like the decor. It's not the biggest buffet you will find, but they have a decent selection and the food is always tasty and fresh. They have a make your own omelet station, Caesar salad, mac and cheese, mashed and au-gratin potatoes, breakfast meat, waffles with toppings, biscuits and gravy, and a variety of pastries, breads, and fruit. I'm probably missing some stuff but that gives you the idea. The selections really haven't changed for years. They also have a build your own Bloody Mary bar. I don't like BM's so I can't comment but they are huge and they have tons of things to put in them.  The service can be sketchy. Several times I have had to wait a really long time for drink refills, new plates, and the check even when they haven't been that busy, but then there were other times when it was fine.

2006-08-10,5.0,"Mini Corn Dogs, Fried Chicken, All You Can Eat Brunch Buffet... seriously, need I say more? How about an occasional sighting of celebs such as Jeremy Piven, John Cusack, Mike Starr (sorry Cassy and John, I had to - hehe), Michael Jordan, and Kid Rock to convince you. Any place that has at least one table full of Chicago Police at all times has to be good. Those guys like their good food... Not the greatest night-scene unless you are with a group. Very casual - no sequins and not too many tube or halter-tops which is cool for a change. Though it definitely seems to appeal to the button-down striped shirt, un-tucked group of dudes who we just can't seem to get away from, sadly...

Oh ... & FYI ... don't ever challenge my best friend that she can't eat a whole slab of ribs ... just cuz she's a girl doesn't mean she can't pack 'em in.  I told her she had to eat the gristle, but alas, she stopped short of gnawing on the bones.",0.5426,0.834,0.101,0.065,0.5215909090909091

The fried Mac and Cheese is quite yummy. I enjoy the dining section in the back that looks like a Kentucky farmhouse, but the bar area is extremely crowded (it's even hard to get through to the dining area) and chock-full of trixies and chads.
