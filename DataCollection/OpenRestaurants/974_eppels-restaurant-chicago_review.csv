2017-07-04,5.0,"I don't live in Chicago anymore so the fact that Eppel's is still fantastic makes me happy.  I couldn't leave without giving them an awesome review.   I don't know what other reviews say because I'm already familiar with the restaurant and had no need to read them.  So I'll just tell you all the reasons why I love Eppel's. 1. Great coffee 2. Free refills  3. Flavored creamers 4. Waitstaff and management are super, crazy friendly and not in a fake, creepy kind of way. 5. The customers are diverse and I always feel like I fit in.  6. They have great chicken wings (I used to order them for breakfast, but not today). 7. When I order well done hashbrowns, they know what that means.  8. I had a veggie omelet with feta today and it was delish! 9. The food is reasonably priced. 10. They don't try to rush you no matter how busy they are.   I'll be gone in a week so I'll probably try to get another meal in before I go.   In summary, eat at Eppel's!",0.9613,0.795,0.173,0.032,0.7195833333333334

2016-02-08,2.0,"This is an iconic diner that has been here through neighborhood changes. The service is friendly and exactly what you'd expect from a diner. They flip tables quickly with barely enough time to wipe it down between guests. In fact, we were seated at a dirty table that was cleaned after we sat down. The menu is HUGE; however, I barely found anything I wanted. Finally, after reading through every page, I settled on the spinach pie... and they didn't have it. So then I got the Greek Salad. The Greek Salad comes with sardines. I like canned sardines so I figured that I'd like them on this salad. NOPE. These were very fishy and crusted with salt. Everything they touched (lettuce, tomatoes, whatever) tasted like them. It was a unique experience for me to dislike a salad SO MUCH. I saw my friends' orders and they didn't entice me either; however, they really enjoyed their food. I don't think that Eppel's has healthy menu options. It's probably not their thing and that's okay; however, given the size of the menu it would have been nice to have something. I'll take a pass on Eppel's the next time my friends want to go out but I think it's good for some folks.

Small diner-like environment, extremely friendly waitresses, and GOOD food. I ordered an omelet. Big portion, came with hash browns, and my choice of toast. However, I could've had French toast or mini waffles without being charged extra. I like having that option of multiple choices. Omelet was loaded with cheese, veggies, and meats and was cooked nicely. Potatoes crisp on the outside, tender on the inside but, needed some salt. My hubby had a skillet that was loaded with ingredients that he enjoyed as well. His mini waffles tasted good, and he loved every bite. The waitresses were attentive and one of them has been working there for about 40 years, and even got her friend a job there too, years ago. It felt like I was at an aunt's house, they were so friendly and funny. Will I be returning? YES, TODAY! Prices are very affordable, and I found out that there's free parking in the rear.This is definitely climbing the list as our favorite go-to place for breakfast.

There's nothing fancy on the menu but they do cater to all types of meat eaters with beef, pork, turkey, chicken and liver products and of course the vegetarian. I've tried the bananas foster crepe, French toast, eggs and turkey sausage patties. The crepes were massive. So much food came out I wasn't sure who was going to help me finish my breakfast. The bananas, nuts and syrup were like sensory overload BUT it was all delicious. On another visit, I was really pleased with my French toast too. It was light and I could really taste the egg from the batter (I love eggs!). All this food on the cheap is a win for me... and it comes out quickly. There's nothing fancy about the restaurant itself either. There are a bunch of booths, counter space with stools and a few tables. The service is okay.

2012-03-18,3.0,"There are only two streets in Chicago, that I can think of, that end in the suffix ""road.""  Those are Irving Park and Roosevelt.  One often finds him or herself strolling down Roosevelt (named for the founder of the Bull Moose Party, not FDR) in the pursuit of alligator shoes, two-for-one underwear, or a feather for one's fedora, and thinking about why this is so, or if this is so.  Inevitably all this thinking and shopping creates ravaging hunger.  This is where Eppel's comes in because it is a restaurant. In a section of town that is a mix of classic old shops and soul draining box stores, Eppel's is on the side of the haberdashery over Target.  Expect the standard old-time breakfast sort of place that has more character than average.   It's more of a greek style restaurant than it is diner, like the nearby White Palace, and they are independently owned in contrast to the robber barons buying up the surrounding property.  If you are hungry and in the area, then Eppel's is probably your best option unless you are in the mood for 6 pounds of meat between two half-dollar size pieces of bread, then go around the corner to Manny's.",0.7096,0.918,0.055,0.027,0.34465811965811965

Upon entering, our waitress was in an all-out argument with a man in a suit, supposedly he though his lemonade was a free re-fill... he thought wrong and she let him know it. She was so pissed I thought she was gonna yell at us. I ordered the ""cod salad"" which arrived at the table not as a salad but as a cod (which wasnt that bad) mashed pot with gravy that was similar to KFC but worse, and the ""fresh greens"" it was supposed to come with was over watered canned green beans that- tasted like water. He got the fish fry and the fish was so fried it was almost hard to eat. His fries tasted like freezer burn that were fried. We're not high class people, i'd be the first to admit it, but this shit was disgusting. I dont know, maybe the breakfast is their forte, but after this lunch, I wont be going back to try it.

It came with a side of waffles, but it was mini waffles, kinda like the leggo my eggo type of waffles. The coffee was nice and fresh and service was great. The owner was very friendly as well. The check wasn't too pricey either. So I probably would come again. I kept fighting with my mother about when this place was opened. I kept thinking that it was opened recently, but my mom insisted that it's been opened for quite some time. So she asked the owner, and the owner said they've been in business for over 20 years.

2009-03-01,2.0,"So, last week ended up being a pretty bad restaurant week for me. Mediocrity everywhere, and it was capped off with a shitty Sunday breakfast at Eppel's. As mentioned in my previous review, I've been eating at this place for YEARS. Today I take a friend who's never been. I'm raving about this place, right? So we happen to be placed in the section of a server named April. Who ""honey"" ""sugar"" and ""baby""'ed us to death...and then had the nerve to try to rush us the hell out of there. Rude as hell. Mind you, I'm not a ""table squatter."" My foodie friends and I are all too sophisticated for that. On a snowy afternoon when it was positively unbusy and NO ONE was waiting for that table, I was absolutely flabbergasted that this server would come over to my dining companion and I and say, ""I'm not trying to be rude but..."" and ask us to move it a long. Skedaddle. Buh-bye. First, April, yeah. You WERE trying to be rude. Second. Trying to rush us out proves you're inexperienced, classless and tactless. Third, being that rude and bitchy was a guarantee that you killed your tip AND just for that, how about we're gonna stay an extra half-hour and make you serve us coffee the whole time, because you know what? We're.Not.Done.Yet. The owner (who DID recognize me) came over and apologized and told us to stay as long as we wanted. Even he was like, ""Hello? We're not even busy today..."" In all the years I've been patronizing this place, I've never been treated like that even when it WAS busy. I cannot stand shitty, patronizing service anywhere, let alone what is essentially a cheap diner. I stand by the fact that the food is good -- convenient location, inexpensive, decent, comfort food. I still think you should go. Just don't sit in April's section. In fact, you should ask who April is and where her section is just so that you know NOT to be seated there.",-0.9439,0.79,0.088,0.122,0.438613172541744
