2017-09-01,2.0,"I'm rating this place on its ability to deliver the basics. That is, a basic breakfast of eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast. Here's the twist, I strongly prefer my eggs over easy (I like the broken yolk to blend in with my potatoes) and I NEED my bacon to be crispy.  Those are my only diversions from an otherwise very basic breakfast. Simple right?? Not for this place. I've been in several times (including today) and asked for the exact same order. The waitress stares me like she is listening to my request, but obviously not.  So what comes back? Well done eggs with hard yolks, limp greasy bacon and for an added touch, raw potatoes. I will say she nailed the toast, but come on!! Oh, and the over priced $3.25 cup of coffee was decent. The place does a good business, and it's a cool, old-time diner, but it consistently fails the test for a basic breakfast MISERABLY.  Just so you're not disappointed.....",0.561,0.821,0.108,0.071,0.4616041567128525

I drink black coffee, so I am very picky about the taste, aroma, etc. of what I am drinking. The coffee is much better than most diner coffee.

A woman literally just pointed her finger at me and asked me how many, I told her, and with finger still pointed to my face, said ""Where are they?""

They brew their very own as a matter of fact. They give you doughnut hole when you walk in the door which are hot and powdered with a little bit of sugar and they also have milk duds for the kids and don't worry you will get your fruit complimentary with your meal. And at the end of it all a little cup of soft serve to top it off.  Now they are known for their skillets literally a whole skillet half omelet and half the sliced potatoes baked to perfection with crispy ends so good. The Greek toast is phenomenal you must try it before you leave it's atleast an inch thick and buttered to perfection. You can have the eggs country style meaning no milk to fluff it up I like to that way and they usually have a special going on daily it's excellent. The Benedicts are great but I personally enjoy the egg smileys with sausage their sausage is huge and soooooo good.

2017-01-26,5.0,"Perfect. Main Street of America, the Mother Road, Will Rogers Highway, all names for US Route 66,  established in 1926, and destined to become one of the most famous roads in America. It ran from downtown Chicago to the Pacific Ocean, at Santa Monica (Los Angeles), California. Towns and cities grew up along side it, merchants prospered as America's love of the automobile grew. It was a major route for families escaping the dust bowl in the 30s. Lou Mitchells, open early, and serving breakfast and lunch menus seven days, there are certain things patrons of Lou's have come to expect: being greeted at the door with a hot donut hole, being expediently served by a professional and happy staff, complimentary Milk Duds on the table, an orange slice and a single prune as an ""amuse,"" and an offer of free ice cream upon the completion of your meal. Not to overlook the obvious, expect quality ingredients, meticulous preparation, and large servings of the menu items.I went with fried eggs and ham, 3 (4?) eggs served in a skillet along with home-cut hash browns, four strips of perfect bacon, and two thick pieces of toast. Like many Chicago diners, Lou's has a giant dish of butter on the table, so feel free to overindulge. I did. Whether you're beginning or ending traversing the Mother Road for a vacation, or just passing thru Chicago on business or pleasure, be sure to include Lou Mitchell's on your ""must"" list.  Especially for those who pine for a time when things were ""better"" in America, Lou Mitchell's will transport you there.",0.9888,0.863,0.137,0.0,0.6344603174603175

Get there on the early side if you don't want to wait because when we left at 11 there was a crowd waiting both inside and outside for tables.  Yes, the free doughnut hole on arrival is lovely. They also give every table a box of milk duds (not sure how that one got started...) and everyone gets a little cup of soft-serve vanilla ice cream at the end of their meal. Such cute little freebies! Not to mention that after ordering the 2 eggs with bacon meal, my skillet arrived with no less than 4 eggs in it!  Looking at the menu, I must say I was a little let down. Based on the glowing reviews and people saying how large and reasonable the breakfast items were, I was expecting something different. It took a long time to order because neither my boyfriend or I were thrilled by any menu items (mostly due to what looked like exorbitant prices). When we finally ordered, however, we realized that all egg orders including omelets come with both hash browns and toast. As far as I could tell, this was stated nowhere on the menu-- it looks like you have to choose one or the other.  Also, $9 is a lot to pay for two eggs, a couple strips of bacon and either home fries OR toast. It's not a lot, however, if you're getting 4 eggs, 4 strips of bacon, home fries AND two huge, homemade slices of toast with homemade jam. While I was pleasantly surprised by what came out of the kitchen, I feel like this restaurant could do a better job of having the menu reflect what customers will be getting when they order something. Or maybe they're just counting on word of mouth and/or the element of surprise to keep customers happy. Whatever it is, I guess it's working! All in all, we came away very full and impressed!

Day 2 an Omelette was tried skillet style and it was equally as good as the previous day while the recommended pot roast sandwich failed miserably.  Dry and without much flavor only the very nice gravy made it passable.

2016-05-17,5.0,"Lou Mitchell's is a widely known ""tourist"" restaurant as a part of Route 66 lore. But to put Lou's in the same category as other ""tourist"" restaurants (i.e. Cheescake Factory) is inappropriate. Lou's is a unique old fashioned diner experience. While it has ""tourist"" elements like tee shirts and coffee mugs for sale at the door, it's also a working restaurant that serves the commuter and business crowd in the west loop. I'm one of those folks - I live a block away and find myself there at least a couple of times a month. Because I've been there many times I wanted to share a few tips for those who might be dropping by during a visit to the city. Tip 1: Timing is everything Most visitors to the city will go to Lou's during their West/South Loop day of visiting Union Station, Sears Tower and Greektown - all within a few blocks of the restaurant. They'll usually do the typical tourist schedule - lazy morning at the hotel, finally get out the door around 9am and decide to go to Lou's since they see it's near Union Station. They get a cab/take a bus and end up at the restaurant at 9:30am. They will end up leaving the restaurant two hours later really grumpy because they blew two hours of their morning when they thought they'd be getting a quick bite at Lou's before hitting the Skydeck at 11am. Instead they finish breakfast close to noon, the lines at the Skydeck are really long, and ""half the day is shot."" Then they write a bad review on Yelp. :-) If you are time starved and still want to try Lou's, go early. Really early. As in right after they open at 5:30am on weekends and before around 7:30am on weekdays. If you go early it's pretty empty with only a few regulars or early-train-out folks at the restaurant. Most of the time when I go I get there around 6am and I am out the door fully fed less than 30 minutes later. After that you're probably going to have to wait in line and there's no real place to wait. There are maybe a handful of seats just inside the door, or you'll be standing out on the street...which in the winter won't be a lot of fun. On a weekday if you opt for counter service you can sometimes beat the line, but you'll be sitting on a stool at a counter for 30 minutes or so which can sometimes challenge your back. Service is prompt but not zippy, just like a real diner. Servers give what they get - if you're friendly and chatty they'll be friendly and chatty and shower you with doughnut holes. If you're a pain they'll be less friendly and chatty and maybe you won't get that refill quite as often. Speaking of refills, that brings me to... Tip 2: Coffee Let's talk about the coffee, which has shown up in many reviews. It's diner coffee, ok? It's not a Starbuck's hand-picked pour-over foo-foo coffee. It's made in a machine that has been making coffee since the 1930's. And it's expensive - something like $4/cup. It's where they make some profit. They give you a doughnut hole on the way in as a way of getting you to buy coffee (duh). On the plus side it's pretty good diner coffee and they will refill it a lot. But it's expensive. If you're on a budget stick with water and avoid coffee and juice. You'll save yourself $8-$10 and be happy. If you're visiting and this is your one time to visit Lou Mitchell's just live a little and get the coffee. Tip 3: Food I've really never had a bad meal at Lou's. Some are better than others, but the food is tasty and a cut above ""diner"" food. My personal preference is an omelet prepared ""skillet"" style. They take your standard fluffy omelet, add potatoes and gravy and toss it in a skillet. How can you not like that? Again if you go early your food will be hot and you will be happy. Whole wheat toast served with butter is divine. Hefty thick slices and rich butter - yum! Goes great with the coffee mentioned above. I've also had the Eggs Benedict - it's okay, but keep in mind Eggs Benedict really needs to be served hot and if it's busy it might not come out as hot as it should. Waffles and pancakes are also awesome - syrup is already at your table. Tip 4: Attitude The key to any restaurant experience is the attitude you have going in. Lou's is a historic diner that has managed to survive all these years. It's not a well polished money extraction machine like Outback Steakhouse. It's in an original building with original furniture and finishes and it's not set up for high volume, so you might have to wait a bit. The people working there are real people who enjoy doing what they do. It's fun to sit in the restaurant and think about the history. You're sitting in the same seats travelers starting their journey on ""The Mother Road"" sat in back when driving across the country was new, exciting, and challenging.  So chat with your friends while you wait in line.  Google some pictures of the restaurant from the 1950's. Drink some overpriced diner coffee. Be nice to your server and most importantly...enjoy the ride.",0.9985,0.841,0.128,0.03,0.4762621452621453

The omelette was one of the fluffiest I have ever had and was massive. It was served with some home baked bread which they buttered for us which was also great. The food was really flavourful.

You'll be in and out within a half hour, feeling fueled for your day.  Great coffee, too. *update* We do not come here for take out donuts or coffee anymore like we used to. We have had multiple experiences of being ignored by nearly all the employees while standing at the take out counter. Horrible, horrible, service in this aspect of the restaurant.

2015-12-05,1.0,"I have walked past this brightly classic Chicago sign almost every day of living in Chicago and decided to try it out one morning. There is usually a semi short line but it seems to clear out quite quickly. It has a diner feel, but not a ""fun"" one, more of a dirty old one that tries to play off the vibe of ""yeah we've been in Chicago for so long so we can just use our name to attract customers instead of making our place quality and clean."" Route 66 signs and classic American themed things like that. We got seated at a dirty table, still old eaten off plates. We asked to get moved to a booth and our waitress reluctantly let us sit at one of the open ones. We checked out the menu, and also noticed our silver ware was dirty, that was a nice touch. There was a little quiz about Chicago at the table which was fun, but again trying to use their name as a wow factor. For example, ""What famous movie was Lou Mitchell's featured in?"" The menu looks pretty ordinary, classic American foods, nothing wrong with that. I ordered the eggs Benedict and my colleague ordered egg whites, potatoes, French toast and a piece of fried chicken.  While we were waiting we got a crusty looking date and a small slice of orange. Not even juicy.  Our food didn't take too long to come, I got the benedict and it looked okay, except for the fact it was cold. Nice. On top of cold potatoes but the edges were warm. Great. Everything was flavorless, but if you ask for hot sauce they will give you a bottle, thank god. The fried chicken was dry, he had one bite and didn't even bother with the rest of it. The waitress was not personable and was more off a ""here is your food, see ya"" over ""how is everything going?"". There is some weird obsession with milk duds (aka the candy that everyone doesn't want at Halloween) here, of all things the waitress made sure was okay with our meal was to make sure we got our milk duds. I almost felt guilty saying I didn't want any.  Everything there is over priced for what you get. As we paid, I noticed that they served baked goods, as it also says on the massive sign outside. I asked about how they bake them and they told me they don't even bake anything in the restaurant...okay.  I am truly surprised if someone eats here and decides to come back. There is potential for greatness in this place, but they haven't even put one ounce of efforts into trying to make it that. I hope in the future that Lou Mitchell's will turn around and really become a Chicago classic diner, instead of a nightmare with bad service and food. Thank you for the terrible experience, I will not be back and I will never recommend this place to anyone I know.",0.9937,0.783,0.151,0.066,0.5528240740740741

I panicked, trying to choke it down, but it just hovered there. Stuck right in the middle of my throat, for what felt like an eternity.

2015-07-21,1.0,"I found this restaurant to be offensively bad. I am not one to write reviews but when I saw the misleading yelp rating (currently 3.5), I had to chime in.  Walking in, I took note of the decor: a handful of route 66 signs and goodwill purchased art, plastered over with condescending handwritten signs like 'Do not take milk duds, hostess will distribute.' We waited for our hostess, actually our server, to get her cut of her last table's bill and we were seated in a booth. The menu was sizable but lacking in some breakfast staples. The menu itself acknowledges this, letting you know that you can ask your server to add potatoes to your omelet to get a pseudo skillet or that you could spend 3 bucks to add what would be a standard ingredient at any other breakfast joint.  The prices were unreasonable: almost six bucks for two eggs and toast. Between two of us,  a salad, sandwich, and two coffees tallied $33 before tip. Those prices are not in the greasy spoon range. They are close to if not over what you would pay at a nicer place like Yolk and that's without any of the nearly compulsory substitutions. Our server was nice but was obviously in the middle of being verbally abused by the manager. I noticed the other wait staff stacking the plates partially on top of the food. I would not like my toast with a nice round imprint of a plate on it. Onto the food: my Popeye sandwich,  a bacon spinach and cheese omelet on ciabatta bread, sounded good. There wasn't much flavor there and I drowned it in hot sauce. The side of potatoes (I say that because we couldn't tell if it was supposed to be chips or hash browns) was an insult to food in all shapes and forms. It was burnt in parts and raw in others and formed a nice blob of potato remains on my plate. Unseasoned and obviously unfit to serve,  one bite was enough to put the pieces together:  This restaurant doesn't give a flying fuck about you.  They want your money for the absolute least cost and effort and like a Nigerian Prince scheme, they only appeal to those who can't even realise a rip off when they see it. The food costs double what the menu description would make you think and the execution is clearly the last thing on their minds. I should have known better than to go to restaurant that would advertise such a base lie as 'world's best coffee' on the marquee.",0.9793,0.831,0.112,0.057,0.4740870240870241

I ordered an omelette with hash browns.  I don't like my hash browns undercooked so I asked for them well done.  My wife ordered hers the same way.  I was surprised when my order came out and my hash browns were potato chips - I will post a photo.  Apparently they don't follow any of the definitions of hash browns as defined at  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ha…  - they slice them and either cook them until they are potato chips like mine, or greasy and undercooked like my wife's - which as I noted above were ordered the same way.

2015-03-11,4.0,"What I great experience, it was an old rustic historical diner in downtown Chicago. It's just a short distance from the beginning of the classic Route 66. Lucky for me, I visited on a business day and I'm the alarm clock for the sun. I arrived about 45 minutes after opening, so there was no line. I was cheerfully greeted by a waitress who seated me and offered me coffee.  As she was pouring my coffee, I told her I had to have an order of their famous donut holes. She giggled and responded, ""Of course your do."" Being an experienced Yelper, I had already scoped out the menu on line and had a fairly good idea of what I was going to order. When Virginia returned with my holes, I placed my order for a Spinach Special Omelette which in addition to spinach, was stuffed with Greek Feta Cheese and Onions. Which can be perfect for someone who is trying to go low-carb.  All egg dishes come with hash browns and a side of toast. Since I was cheating on my low-carb with the hash browns, when Virginia asked me which bread I wanted, I told her I'd pass on the bread. She gave me a Medea look right out of a Tyler Perry movie and said, ""You're passing on our bread?"" As I said yes, she sighed slightly and walked away.  As I munched on the holes (which were just okay) and read fliers on my table, I understood the Medea glare. I quickly looked towards the back of the restaurant and got Virginias attention. When she came back to my table I said,""You bake your own bread, here. No wonder you looked at me like I was crazy when I said, no bread."" She giggled and told me I was forgiven. She told me all the different types of breads and I choose wheat. When my omelette arrived, it was overstuffed with spinach and Feta Cheese. The outside was too dark for me, I prefer a more even light color. However, the flavor was bursting out of the overstuffed omelette. The Hash Browns were crispy, but they were what I'd call American Fries. The potatoes were thinly sliced, not shredded like traditional hash browns. Oh, the toast, it was thick slices, smeared with butter and served with small jars of jelly and marmalade. I normally pass on bread when having breakfast out, but I will always enjoy my toast here. It was like having bread baked by my mom or Aunt.",0.9645,0.892,0.082,0.026,0.5090548340548341

Service was a little sketchy, however. Our server was not too attentive nor was she explicit w our orders. I had to basically fill in all of her blanks w my order. For example, I had the Denver omelette. She never asked what kind of toast I wanted. She was about to leave our table until I told her what toast I wanted. It didn't take too long to get our orders. Once she brought them, it took her literally 10 min or so to come back and ask if we needed anything else, which we did but a bus boy helped us.  All in all, everything was good.

2015-01-14,4.0,"Totally my kind of place, because it has such vintage charm inclusive the people working there. The atmosphere is to me very comfortable, I can be very chatty, so if I get to sit at a counter and am allowed to throw (friendly) comments back and forth with others sitting there and with staff I feel like at home in my grandma's kitchen. It's the kind of place where the waitresses are called ""Donna"" and ""Virginia"" and don't look like they are REALLY there only because they are waiting for when that modelling agency calls back where they signed up, whilst they are also playing lead guitar in a rock band.  Not that I have an issue with either, not at all, in fact, but it does help if waiting staff can identify with the job description: taking care of customers. Personally I like the food a lot, very American home style cooking, although I admit being not originally American it did take me exactly four years before I could even smell eggs and bacon on an empty stomach for breakfast, far from enjoying it. Being very into healthy eating after all I appreciate the freshly squeezed juice, fruit and prune options, and the homemade marmalade is angelic. If I was more often in town I would eat there probably twice a week or more. The only BUT, which is the reason that cost it five minus one *star: all the eggy breakfast are being made in small aluminum pans.

I've had to wait a little to put my order in, and wait a bit longer for food than expected, and there may have been a mix up with whether or not I had ordered a side of whatever on a few occasions... But over all, the waits were not unacceptably long and the food when it came was always fresh and hot and delicious. I also like that they give you a little plate of oranges with your check to freshen your mouth of all the bacon grease you probably just consumed. Lol!

No one should ever eat that much. It's everything that is wrong with America.  The draw of this place I think is the unique things they serve you with breakfast- an orange slice and a prune to start followed by milk duds and a cup of frozen yogurt. How this started I have no idea. But I stick to the fact that this is breakfast and no one needs this. Just more food on top of my 4 egg omelet with fried potato chips they pass off as hashbrowns and Texas toast.  The food is fine, hence the 2 star vs. 1.

2013-08-15,4.0,"Having been to plenty of breakfast joints this past week, I definitely can articulate what sets this place apart from others.  LM is most certainly a 'diner', a term others may use to denote a restaurant of a second tier(or quality), but may miss the point about what is good. Not every place has to have the ambiance of a tourist trap, nor the über healthy menu predominantly displayed. This place is made to fill your stomach and send you on your way. Had to wait?  A little. Busy waitstaff?  Yes. But what makes this special is the waitstaff knows people's names. They are incredibly polite, even when crushed with tourists and locals. CTA drivers on either side of me, always a good sign.  You're going to be waiting in line at the Sears/Willis tower anyway - may as well start off a couple of blocks west and have a good meal to fuel your day. My recommendation?  Try the biscuits and gravy.  Hats off to Beverly and the rest of the crew at Lou Mitchell's.",0.9184,0.793,0.135,0.072,0.4637755102040816

2013-08-07,4.0,"What a gem! After walking from our River North hotel to this place in the freezing rain, we had high hopes and we weren't let down. It's very old school, a 1950s style diner with some stories to tell. We walked in and they offered us the token donut holes, not the freshest things in the world but hey - IT'S FREE, so we obliged.  We had looked online at the menu ahead of time and decided to split a bacon pecan waffle, but then the salami and swiss omelet piqued our interest so we split that too. Ordinarily, I would expect them to bring out the waffle and the omelet and then bring extra plates to split our own but our waitress went above and beyond. She came out with 2 separate presentations of 1/2 bacon pecan waffles and 2 separate presentations of the salami/swiss omelet. WITHOUT US ASKING HER TO DO SO. It was one of the simplest service tricks in the book, but it showed me this lady knew what was up and how to take care of her customers. Oh, and the food was good, too. The waffle was sweet, but not too sweet with the right combination of softness in the inside and crunch on the outside edges. The omelet was a great mix of flavors that you don't normally see with eggs, but with a side of jardiniere it was diner perfection. This place may only be a diner, but the service I received topped service I've gotten at some formal dining establishments - for this I will not only be returning, but I'll referring everyone I know.",0.9911,0.853,0.137,0.01,0.5573295985060691
2013-07-29,1.0,"FOUND A WORM IN MY WAFFLE! I have been coming to Lou Mitchell's infrequently for quite some time.  Although it's not the BEST food you'll ever have, it's always been decent and convenient.   This previous visit, however, will be my LAST. We ordered a bacon pecan waffle and finished most of it before I saw something strange baked into it.  I picked it out with a fork and was horrified to see that it was a GRUB, or MEALWORM type thing... whatever it was it was GROSS!  (see posted photo) My girlfriend, who also ate some of the waffle, had to excuse herself to go and throw up in the bathroom, it was that bad.  I immediately asked for a manager and she was also concerned with my finding.  She ended up comping our meal, and also took my phone number down to give to the owner of the restaurant, and I stressed that I would appreciate a callback from the owner.  Meanwhile, the couple at the table next to us, who witnessed it and still hadn't ordered, excused themselves and went elsewhere (good move). Now, I understand that these things can happen.  The cleaner the restaurant the less likelihood of this type of thing occurring though.  It makes me question the sanitation of the kitchen and also the freshness of the ingredients they use.  But all things aside, I told myself that I would not write this review if the owner called me to apologize and was at all sympathetic to what happened.  After a week and a half of waiting, I never received any word from the owner.  If the owner doesn't take pride in his/her establishment and wouldn't make a simple phone call to respond to a concerned diner who found a worm in their food, then I will not be sympathetic in return.  I'm posting the photo that I took of the worm, and also reporting them to the health department. I'll let you fine folks decide for yourselves after reading this if Lou Mitchell's is the type of place you want to visit.  All I'm saying is that you might want to inspect your food first before putting it in your mouth. UPDATE:  Since posting this review, I checked on the City of Chicago Health Inspection official site and was able to find the following information as to Lou Mitchell's recent health inspections...  Here are just a few that caught my attention, which you may wish to consider before visiting.  To be fair, there were a lot of positive remarks as well and Lou Mitchell's did officially ""pass"" all the inspections that I noticed.  There were also other remarks that no evidence was found of rodents or pests (although the photo of my waffle suggests otherwise)!  Some of the negative comments I am copy/pasting here, in case anyone is interested to read further: Inspection Date  06/14/2013  Type: Complaint  Risk 1 (HIGH) SEWAGE AND WASTE WATER DISPOSAL, NO BACK SIPHONAGE, CROSS CONNECTION AND/OR BACK FLOW - Comments: OBSERVED WASTE WATER ON BASEMENT FOOD PREPARATION AND STORAGE AREAS.

The tables are already set when you arrive with coffee cups, a sugar dispenser, S&P, flatware on the napkin, and, ideally, a sticky, leaking dispenser of maple syrup.

When we walked over there, it was in the middle of the lunch hour rush, so it was pretty busy. Looked at the take out menu and noticed there were no prices listed. If you want to find out prices, have to look at the actual dine-in menu.  I ordered the cesear chicken salad. When I requested for a roll (the salad came with either a roll, greek bread, wheat or rye bread) was disappointed not just because Lou Mitchell's was out of dinner rolls, but the lady who took my order made no mention the kitchen was making more dinner rolls. Any good restaurant knows if you run out of something as simple as dinner rolls, you can make more.  The cesear chicken salad was just 'meh'. Didn't taste much flavor in the chicken, plus the croutons were not crisps (as croutons are usually are in a salad). Expected much better for a salad that cost a little over $11. I honestly had much better: Zeus, which is a few blocks away, I'm able to buy a much larger chicken salad with extra ranch dressing and extra pita bread for around $9. Same at Panera: BBQ chicken salad, much larger portion, with extra BBQ sauce, and chips, for around $9.  I guess with the high prices at Lou Mitchell's, they managed to be in business for over 80 years due to the prime location spot on Jackson, plus they are very strong with their breakfasts.  So would I go back? Not for salads. :)   Would I go to Lou Mitchell's to try their breakfasts? Possibly.",0.9467,0.863,0.093,0.045,0.5034854497354497

Before we get into the food, guaranteed you'll have heard about this diner if you've read anything about Route 66, have lived in, or visited Chicago with a local. Since 1923, it's grown into what is now a regular stomping ground for the famous... and presidential. It's menu is ginormous and options to almost create your own meal by adding this or that to any entree might make your head spin. They get people like options. Not cheap but it's donut holes are really a meal in and of itself. Free ones to practically inhale while you wait or take some to go. If you don't mind packing a couple hundred cals in minutes flat and then turn around and go home, you might be just as satisfied as I was after one of those. But no, of course I attempted to satisfy my craving of corn beef and hash. I agree with other Yelpers that the scrambled eggs are just odd. So fluffy that there aren't exactly  whites but could remind you of them. No flavor, really. Just different. Pretty non-traditional so recommend that if you usually get scrambled, it might not be exactly what you had in mind. Coffee was about average and the fresh squeezed juice is a bit pricey. Yes, you can get your box of Milk Duds when you dine here but the donut holes are probably the draw for me. I think I have to get back and give it another shot because the big crowd, lots of regulars who breakfast here clearly love Lou M's for a reason. Sometimes it's just one dish.

We arrived around 8:30 on a Sunday, and there were four of us.  We were the second group in line, and the boys in our group were parking the car (and subsequently fighting with the machine).  So they were later than my friend and I.  The lady at the front was extremely brisk (bordering on rude--maybe that's how she always is??) and she asked us how many, and we said four.  She looked behind us, saw they weren't there, and said ""I can't seat you.  Everyone's not here"".  But the way she said it was reminiscent of the ""NO SOUP FOR YOU"" from the classic Seinfeld episode. She even took the other people in line as she saw the boys walking in.  We had to wait an extra 10 minutes or so on top of that, so that really stunk right off the bat.  There was another guy walking around with a basket of donut holes.  My friend and I each had our one-hole-per-customer, and THEN the boys joined us.  The hostess asked them if they got their donuts, and they said no.  The guy with the basket comes around again, and refused to give them donuts because he didn't remember that it was just the girls in line and not them.   He thought they were trying to cheat him out of two donut holes?  Really???

2012-01-22,3.0,"Um... This place is hilarious.  It's a super old school diner that's been around since 1923.  I think there was one re-vamp since then... sometime in the 60s, I'd assume... but clearly nothin' much has changed since then.  Not the food, nor the signage, nor the counters, nor the staff. And not its popularity either.  That's right.  We waited in line, following strict orders given by the drill seargent.... er, uh, lovely hostess, in order to experience this movie set-like restaurant.   The most interesting thing about this place are all the little freebies they're handing out along the way.  Really, kind of odd.  First it's the delicious, freshly fried doughnut holes while you stand in line.  I guess if you're being bossed around and have to wait, they have to distract you.  It worked.  Then, when you're finally seated, the hostess hands you a little box of milk duds as if it's normal  Huh?  Well, sure.  Why not, I guess.  Soon after that arrives a nice, fat orange slice and a single prune.  I guess that explains who their target market is. In general, the food isn't anything to write home about (or a write a blog post about, for that matter).  It's diner food in the true sense.  Eggs a million ways, sausage, bacon, steamed yet burned potatoes that require lots of ketchup.  You get the idea.  The kind of breakfast where you keep the salt shaker within quick reach.   Except the pancakes, that is, because they were FABULOUS!  This is my favorite kind of pancake; really thin and kinda tangy.  I think they call them ""meltaway,"" which makes perfect sense.  There are a bunch of other kinds on the menu, too, (buckwheat, banana, pecan) but I'm not sure I could bring myself to ever order them. And wait a minute!  We ordered ONE pancake on the side... not two.  Is this ol' bird trying to pull one over on us?  Is this the way they make their money?  Just serve and charge people for more than they ordered?   Sneakily adding things to customers' checks?  I got my eye on you...   The big, fluffy ""Greek"" toast was pretty good, too.  But that could have also had something to do with the healthy schloping of whipped butter applied with a spatula straight from a heaping, massive mixing bowl.  It's texture was very airy and light, allowing for extra butter absorbsion.  Mmmm... The poached eggs were poached eggs (along with some extra water that could have been drained).  Hey!  Wait!  My '2 poached eggs' has 3 yolks!  'Three eggs' wasn't even an option on the menu!  Really, are we being dooped?  That's when we check the skillet.  It, too, had 3 eggs!  What's going on here?...   But when the check arrived, all was in order.  Two eggs, 2 eggs, one pancake.  AND, when she presented it, she also offered some complimentary ice cream, which one of us happily accepted. My astonishment must've been conveyed in my facial expression because our waitress (and yes, waitress, not server, is the proper term in this case... trust me) laughed at me and offered, ""That's just how we do it here, honey!"" So, in all, FOR FREE, Lou Mitchell's gave us:  2 doughnut holes, 2 mini boxes of Milk Duds, 2 fat orange slices, 2 prunes, 2 eggs, 1 pancake, 1 soft serve ice cream.  Heck of a deal, I'd say. The service was friendly and fast, though obviously not fancy.  Bus tubs sat in the center of the room collecting the mess from the efforts of who I imagined to be ""Betty"" and ""Phyllis"".  It isn't hard to see what Lou Mitchell's was like in its real heyday... probably very similar but with a younger ""Betty"" and ""Phyllis"".

The side that comes with it is supposed to be hash browns, but it's just a potato grease. If you ever had a dream about drinking cholesterol by glasses that's the place for you! You'll also be enjoying the smell of grease on your clothes for the rest of the day. Don't worry, that's complementary. On top of all that, the place is cash only. It's 21st century. Come on!

My husband and I were meeting some friends for breakfast around 9am on a Friday.  When we arrived, I walked to the dining area to see if they were already seated.  Out of the corner of my eye, I see the lady at the counter feverishly waving me to come back.  The restaurant was not crowded at all and most of the people were seated towards the back.  I needed to see if our friends were there yet.  The lady, long black hair, latin descent, continued to take people at the register and told me she would be right with me after these customers paid their bills and mumbled something to them under her breath.   Fine, my husband and I stood there and then she came running to grab her basket of donut holes to offer us one.  Um, no, I do not eat from where other people have grabbed, germs!!  That's another story all together.  She reprimanded me that I was not able to seat myself and I told her that I was just looking for some friends we were meeting.  My husband asked her for a booth and she said vehemently, no that it was the rules for the whole party to be there before being seated.  My husband who wanted to just sit and chat and order some coffee and, but she stood in our way.  Going on and on about the rules of the restaurant, ok lady we heard you but the restaurant is in no way full, and there is not a line in front of us or in back.  Let us sit???  When all of a sudden someone comes in from behind and goes to a booth to meet his friend that has been sitting there for God knows how long reading the paper!! are you kidding me??  She stammered something like he must have gotten past me and sat and blah blah blah.  We left her talking and told her she lost some pretty loyal customers because of her ignorance.

Some of the other things didn't make it to us--the donut holes and Milkduds among them. It was definitely reasonably priced for breakfast--eggs for $5-something, Belgian waffle for $6-something (still too much for batter in a waffle machine, but unfortunately the standard--this is on the low-priced side). They had a juicer for fresh OJ. And free refills on soda, which is nice, and unusual for me (I'm from NY) although probably standard in Chicago.

Who else gives you free donut holes, milk duds, orange slices, a little prune (you know, to help everything go down), AND frozen custard complimentary with each meal? Um, nowhere.  They squeeze just about a million different kinds of juices and their coffee is REALLY fantastic due to great quality beans and roast, but also the filtered water they use. They also sell it by the pound so you can brew it up at home!  Lou Mitchell's is great for kids because it's loud, busy and unpretentious. However, just be sure your kid can wait in a long line to get in on a weekend. But why not just come early instead? There's barely any line, if any at all, at 8:30am. The only bad thing about no wait is that you won't get as many free donut holes.  The service? You gotta love these people.

2011-08-05,3.0,"The food is unbelievable amazing. The omelettes are the best combination of tasty and fluffy. I strongly recommend the greek sausage special omelette and the silver dollar pancakes. The pancakes are very soft, warm and will completely change your standards on how pancakes should be made. Throw on a dash of their made in-house syrup or jellies (especially their orange marmalade!!) on their pancakes or waffles and you have yourself a delectable experience.  The greatness does not stop with the food. They have fresh juice  and arguably the best tasting coffee I have ever had as well. I am by no means a coffee expert, but I know good coffee when I consume it. It won a Gold Cup Award, so it definitely has earned its' street cred.  They also give out complimentary Milk Duds (ladies and children only) and mini donuts that resemble hush puppies. For those with a peanut allergy, do not eat the donuts because they are prepared with peanut oil.  This place is very classic. It has been open since the 1920s and the family feel makes its' presence in this little hot spot. The theme of the restaurant pay homage to the diners that one would find off an interstate highway in the middle of nowhere. They also have outdoor seating, which is nice when it is not too hot and traffic is not too bad. I do not really like choking on exhaust fumes while indulging in food. The restaurant is not too loud, children friendly and one thing unique about the tables is that they are arranged in a long line, so it is almost like eating cafeteria style. The table arrangement is not a plus or a minus, and they also have booths and counters for smaller parties.  Bring cash, they do not accept credit/debit cards or checks!! Also, due to having to deal with such high demand, do not plan on being seated until your entire party is present. Some may see this as off-putting, but I believe it is a testament to just how amazing their food is.  The only  drawback I can think of is the service. Depending on who your waiter/waitress is, you may be very satisfied or unhappy with your server.

I had high expectations after reading the reviews but I am hardly a stranger to great breakfast spots, especially considering the fact that NY houses many. We arrived at about a quarter to nine and to my relief there was no line.

The waiting staff here is extremely gracious, witty, and attentive. Our server Linda had me nearly choking on my waffles she was so funny. I ordered the pecan and bacon Belgian waffle which I doused in their special brand of maple syrup, topping it off with fresh butter. Meal was delicious and coffee was delicious and NEVER empty.  The mini soft serve samples at the end of the meal (complimentary) were also a lovely and refreshing touch.

It is a dinky cup, sure it's fresh-squeezed, but it also costs $4.95, as much as the side of bacon. Not worth it, IMO. The banana pancakes were good. Definitely filled me up, no complaints. I felt like they finally did bacon right: nice and crispy. Worth the $4? I don't know... My friend ordered the hobo skillet, which looked really good. The chief complaint was with our server. She messed up our order then acted frustrated with us, like it was *our* fault, leaving us feeling uncomfortable. She took forever to bring us our check, and when we asked for change she made some off-hand comment like we shouldn't skimp on the tip.

The service was great- just the right amount of table visits but always there when a refill was needed.  The skillet egg breakfast was cooked perfectly and the breakfast potatoes had just the right amount of seasoning. The homemade raisin toast was amazing, big thick slices when slathered with butter put the store bought raisin breads to shame. I had to order a side order of donut holes, too just because they were so good. Along with our check, we also got a box of Milk Duds and a brief history behind the MIlk Dud tradition.

I really enjoy the atmosphere.  Its nice to hit up a nice chill diner on occasion, and today this place fit the bill perfectly on a cold winters day. We were seated without a wait, and each of us were handed a complementary donut hole on the way in.  (that was a first for me, and much appreciated!) Our waitress was a trip, very nice and very attentive lady.  So service was top notch. My food was just alright.  I got the Popeye (embarrasingly, all four of us got the same thing) and it just didn't quite hit the spot.  The bacon was just ground up into little bits and cooked into the egg, not what I was expecting.  Also, the sandwich came with swiss.  I asked if I could switch to cheddar, which they had no problem doing, but then I was charged a dollar for it??? Also, the place makes a somewhat big deal of advertising its 'bakery'.  Well, its nearly impossible to find and when you do you'll be underwhelmed.  It consists of a small basket by the register with a few saran wrapped muffins and cookies.  Not what I was expecting to say the least.

I have only gotten the omelettes here and have loved every one I have tried... it was just one of those experiences that when I first had one I couldn't dream of ever ordering anything else. Good breakfast food is hard to perfect and everything that I or my friends have tried here has been very well received (my favorites are the apple and cheese omelette and the run of the road ham, tomato, and cheese omelette) To say that the service is bad is in my opinion an oversimplification. I have always had my order promptly taken, water glass kept decently full, and food served to me in a very acceptable time frame. Now was it done with a smile on my waitress' face? Nope, as a matter of fact I always am afraid of messing up my order because she would just look at me with a ""you stupid or somethin?"" look... and I love it. The food is just outstanding and I have never had a bad experience here in my 3 years I have lived in the area and I am a big fan that many of the women they employ there seem to have had less than easy lives.

Because were I coming in from a trip out West on Route 66 (it's practically at the Eastern terminus) and entering this supposedly magnificent, archetypal American city Chicago, I'd go in here and order everything from the menu. I DID order after getting back into Shitcago (sorry, but I pretty much hate it here) from DC (visiting the fiance and the folks at my sister's near DC for Thanksgiving). It was a cold, snowy day, and I'd just had an awesome train ride. So, super ravenous, I stepped out of Union Station in the very early morning to see the lights of this place. I decided to check it out, and I can count that on one of the few good decisions I've made since moving out here. They make their own donuts (really good) and roast their own coffee (good stuff). But the real star was the apple and cheddar omelet with Michigan apples and Wisconsin Cheddar, served in a skillet over hash browns. They were just what I needed. I've only been back once since then. It's one of the few things about this city that attracts any loyalty (OK, OK, The Loop is great, and Hyde Park and the Gold Coast are OK). If I could afford it (reasonable enough but a bit steep for diner prices), I'd eat here every morning. But I like making my own eggs, too.",0.9917,0.815,0.166,0.019,0.6174712643678161

My friend and I were to be seated at the bar where there were two open seats on a busy Sunday morning only to discover that one of the seats had ""already"" been occupied. We got a snotty look from Patron Number One as she matter-of-factly stated that her friend Patron Number Two was seated in one of our seats. We sheepishly walked back over to the door and reclaimed our spot in line. The woman who attempted to seat us apologized more than once. No big deal. We were later seated across from each other in the middle of a loooooooong table. My friend was in the bathroom when we were seated, and the second hostess asked me if my friend was ""actually here"". (At this point, I wondered if part of Lou Mitchell's schtick was along the lines of Ed Debevic's: crabby wait staff and in your face, over the top ""bad"" service. It's not.) I guess they have issues seating groups that have not entirely arrived which creates problems all around. I told her the other half of my party was in the bathroom and I got the feeling she didn't believe me. She seated me anyway. No big deal. Anyway, our waiter was quite friendly and accommodating. Started out with what I learned is the usual (donut holes while waiting in line, tiny box of milk duds on the table, orange wedge and prune in bowl, meal punctuated by small cup of vanilla soft serve). I know it was our fault for not checking, but we were in the mood for some fresh squeezed orange juice, and found out upon receiving our check that each of our two very mediocre (in both size and quality) orange juices cost $4.95. Over 1/3 of our total bill. Our fault for not checking beforehand, but it didn't taste fresh to me-- could easily have been Minute Maid with extra pulp. Not impressed, but glad I found out too late for it to ruin the meal. I had a hankering for some stuffed french toast, so I made do by spreading cream cheese on my french toast with blueberries and whipped cream. Make that whipped cream with a side of toast and fruit. When the plate arrived all I could see was cream. It was good, but nothing I couldn't have enjoyed in the privacy of a booth at Denny's or IHOP.

Dude, it's not a gourmet breakfast place. But for what it is, you better believe it is 5-star. All the way 5-star. We were in Chicago for a weekend and a helpful bartender gave us the local 411 to try this place. So we did.  The joint has been open since 1923. If it was lame it would have closed long ago. But it's not. It is just one enormous skillet of awesomeness. I will explain.  Yes, like others have said, you get a free donut hole, Milk Duds (for ladies and kids), an orange slice, a prune and a vanilla soft serve ice cream sample.  This place is a slice of Americana. Do you go because it is an institution? Hell yeah. Do you go for waiters in black ties and stuffy attitudes? Uh, no. Go someplace else for that. Okay, our experice: there was a line out the door and we ended up standing on the sidewalk in 20 degree weather. I don't mind the cold having grown up in the Northeast so it was no biggie. A teenager who worked there walked through the line with his basket of fresh donut holes for the poeple waiting. Gimmicky? Sure. A nice touch, you bet. It made the wait easier. The figured it out. For 25 cents they keep people waiting in line happy. That is just brilliant business.  Did I mention that they make their own bread? They do and it was great. And they make their own orange juice. And their own orange marmalade. I had the spinach special omelette, whole wheat toast and large oj. I chose that omelette because everything sounded so damn good that I could not make up my mind. Spinach, feta cheese and sauteed onions. Served in a skillet with home fries. If I were an ESPN announcer the next words you would read would be ""BOO-YAH!""  Yeah, in a good way. The waitress looked like she had been there since the time when they first opened the doors. Craggy, wrinkled face from too many mid-western winters. Gnarled fingers from years of serving food. And a playful but to the point attitude. LOVED HER. Think about it. She is in Chicago and had Greenbay Packer earrings on. Huge cajones. She steered us in the right direction and clearly enjoyed what she did. The ""busboy"" was in his 50's and ever present with the fill of a glass of water or the refill of a coffee. Great smile and super attitude. He had a fantastic sense of humor.  From their menu ""Come for a good time, not a long time."" It is not a place to sit for hours over a cup of coffee and bs the day away. But they do not press you and the pace was unhurried. The four of us enjoyed it so much that we went back the next day for breakfast. I was only there for two days and even with all of the breakfast choices I had, I went back to Lou Mitchell's.

Decor: 3 out of 5 They're not spending the money on decorating the walls, but it's not like the place is shabby, you know?  I like how they have the big see through door fridges in the front where you can see all the citrus fruit.  You can tell which ones will be served and which ones will be soon making their way to ye ol' Marmalade maker.   Service: 4 out of 5 We had a very large group go in for breakfast (18 or 19, to be exact) and they were able to seat us close to one another.  The service was quick and attentive, but not overbearing.  I have nothing negative to say about what we were offered or the manner in which it was offered.  Definitely better than most restaurants, but I'm not going to say, ""I love it!""   Quality of food: 4 out of 5 Sadly, I might have made a mistake when I ordered biscuits and gravy this morning.  Not saying that they weren't delicious because lo and behold, not only were their ground pieces of sausage in there, in my large swimming pool of gravy there were also chunks of encased sausage.  The biscuits were good, though I would have liked them a little fluffier myself (subjective).  I looked around at what other people ordered though, and they seemed to be enjoying their food greatly.  Please see the picture I took of my co-worker and his egg and sausage sandwich.  It was huge, and the sausage wasn't a patty - there were these huge links cut in half and placed arch-like on the bottom piece of bread.  Overall, the quality of food was great.  As others have alluded to, I got the orange and prune.  Usually I'm not a huge prune guy, but these looked different and honestly - they weren't bad at all.  Oh yes, and be prepared for the best darndest ice cream at the end of your meal.  They bring you a little cup of it and honestly, I don't know if it's home made or what, but it TASTES like it's just iced cream.  Literal sweetened cream in somewhat iced fashion.  Of course, I could be wrong and might have been bulk soft serve, but it was deeeelicious.     Portion size: 5 out of 5 You will not be going hungry here.  That is all. Minor (and not so minor) Gripes: Remember that this place is cash only.  Not a biggie since there's an ATM right in the restaurant.  However, the one thing I did notice was that this restaurant is wheelchair accessible,. but the bathrooms did not appear to be.  Instead, they are on the lower level of the restaurant and you need to take stairs to get down there.  I myself did not see an elevator or ramp.  Not saying they're not there, I'm just saying I myself didn't see them.   Overall: 4 out of 5 Highly recommended if you're looking for a good breakfast, brunch, or lunch.  Lots to pick from, and after 10:30 in the morning they start serving ""lunch type"" sandwiches as well.",0.9978,0.833,0.14,0.027,0.5256402116402116

There was a long line, but here is a tip: Check to see if there are vacancies at the counter. We sat down at Donna's counter. She had Chicago Cubs earrings on, lol. I expected the ""milk duds and warm donut holes"" but instead received a slice of orange and prune (maybe we looked like we wanted the healthy option, lol). The prune was really good (I think they must have prepared it that day). I was about to try the 1/2 lb. angus burger, but I was side-tracked by the ""lightest and fluffiest omelettes."" Donna also recommended the omelette (specifically the apple and cheese one if I had a sweet tooth, or the Greek sausage special. I must say that my omelette was really good (latter choice), but I ate most of my friend's omelette: mushroom with gardenia (Italian pickled peppers), which tasted like a pizza without carbs.  The coffee was really, really good. They use purified water (will upload photo later). I wanted to try the quart of freshly squeezed orange juice, and coconut cake, but I had to pace myself. They serve generous portions. Donna was great because she warned us (but that's why we're going to go back tomorrow), yay! We had some soft-serve ice cream. It was really, really good. Better than Dairy Queen, Ikea and McDonald's. She said that was also home-made. All in all, amazing service and amazing brunch, and I'm not even a breakfast person.

2009-08-23,2.0,"We arrived here completely by accident for lunch today, and we never even noticed the two strangely placed signs saying cash only until we were leaving. That's how obvious they were-we ended up having to get cash from the ATM. Anyway, we got there and there was no hostess to be found. We were actually seated by the cashier, who told us to grab a few menus and pointed to a booth. Fine, not a huge deal. Our waitress came by and took our drink order within a few minutes of us sitting down. She came back within a timely manner, but that was it as far as things being fast go. We placed our order-my bf got silver dollar pancakes and I got 2 eggs sunny side up with white toast. After I placed my order, she asked if I wanted butter, and I said no (this will come into play later).  It took at least 20 minutes for our food to come. Our waitress came by 10 minutes after the order was placed and said she'd check on our food, but she didn't say anything to us after and it still took forever to show up.  Once it did, it was met with disappointment on my end. They gave me 4 of the smallest egg yolks I've ever seen (I ordered 2). Then I picked up the toast, and not only did it have butter, but it was literally DRENCHED in it. Not only was it super gross, but it would've made me incredibly sick to eat, so I left it alone. My boyfriend wanted me to ask for new toast, especially since she'd specifically asked if I wanted butter or not (and then repeated it to me when I said no), but as it turned out, the eggs didn't need toast because they were so overcooked. I literally had no trouble just picking up the yolk and eating it without much breakage (only one egg had any). They also supplied me with greasy scalloped potatoes that I wasn't expecting and didn't eat much of.  I was so disappointed. I love breakfast, but that was one of the least satisfying breakfast's I've ever had.  My boyfriend was given 10 silver dollar pancakes (which, by the way, are much larger than a silver dollar) that were thin, full of holes, and pretty good actually. At least one of us enjoyed our meal.  Overall, it was an ok experience (but only because of the pancakes), but nothing to write home about, and we have no plans to go back. Something else we both noticed was that other than the cashier, all of the workers seemed to be over 40-many older ladies. We're both curious now if you have to be over 40 to be hired there. Literally the only younger person there was the cashier (not that 40 is old, but there was only 1 40 something in the whole place). Funny. Another thing to point out that I am reading about on yelp is ice cream. Seems it's normally offered (and we saw plenty being given to customers in tiny plastic bowls) to people, only we never got any. What's up with that?

2009-06-21,1.0,"I just had breakfast at Lou Mitchell's for the first time today. I didn't have any expectations because I had never heard of the place or its reputation and had not looked it up on yelp.  So...my unbiased opinion is ""gross.""  First off, the waitress seemed to slam down my order when I didn't reach out for it as quickly as she would have liked me to.  I ordered the Organic seasonal fruit parfait (fruit, yogurt, granola). It comes in a tall sundae glass so it was presented well but too bad the blueberries had MOLD on them! I noticed the fuzzy gray mold right away and bent over to whisper to the waitress that there was mold on my blueberries and as soon as she heard what I told her she seemed very irritated....at ME! She said ""MOLD?!!! Do you want something else?"" I told her I would take the same thing but minus the blueberries (to avoid any more mold). She acted like this was a problem (even told me well that's gonna take a little bit) but she went back and told the kitchen to remake me another parfait minus the blueberries...  Get this! When she brought me the NEW fruit parfait she sets it down and says ""here you go, one fruit parfait...those are raisins."" Yes, in fact, there were raisins BUT there was still one lone blueberry right on top of my parfait and it still had MOLD on it! I swear, did the kitchen do this on purpose?? When I had eaten my way through to the middle of the parfait the yogurt suddenly looked discolored and slimy. Sorry...this is gross, I know. I lost my appetite not knowing why the yogurt looked so nasty. I didn't bother telling the waitress again that my parfait still had the moldy blueberry nor did I try to convince her I thought my yogurt was slimy...I think she would have bit my head off. Oh yeah, the service was slow even though we got there with NO line at all on Father's Day....We didn't care because we were visiting relatives but otherwise it would have been a problem. Also, there were so many condiments (which I am sure should have been refrigerated) on the table when we arrived that there was not much room on the table for our glasses/plates/etc.  If you have a larger stroller do not think you'll get it into the door without folding it up AND there is such a lack of room in this place that they request you to leave the stroller in a designated place by the door (instead of setting it beside your table). Hmm...what else...Yeah the donut holes were soggy and cool even though the hostess had JUST brought out a ""new"" basket of donut holes.

I didn't believe them when they said the toast was the most amazing toast I'd ever eat. One bite, and I was converted. Lou Mitchell's toast is amazing. DO NOT SKIP IT. And when they ask you if you want it buttered, the answer is yes.  The portions here are huge and the prices are so reasonable. If you think you might want to eat again later in the day, splitting one egg scrambled, potatoes, with an extra side of toast is the perfect amount of food for two (provided that those two individuals are neither football players nor teenage boys). I highly recommend adding feta cheese to your scrambled eggs.  I can't quite give it 5 stars because the service can be spotty at times and you more than likely will be sitting at a long table next to strangers rather than a booth or a stand alone table.

There is a certain quality, a certain state of mind one seeks in a breakfast spot. Located on what seemed to me an otherwise quiet part of town, I arrived at Lou Mitchell's on a sunday morning, 9am to be precise. Already a line had formed out the door and the place was bustling with the weekend locals. Fresh from their bakery arm, they serve up free donut holes to appease the waiting crowd. After a 15 minute wait, we were finally seated and greeted by a kind ""veteran"", a lady who seemed to have made of the very same plasma that Lou Mitchell's seems to be made of. A full and extensive menu ranging from pancakes and waffles to fried eggs and ham. And to top it all off they serve their eggs right in a skillet it's cooked in! This honest uniqueness and ""homey"" feeling makes you feel welcome whether a local or a visitor. My breakfast was amazing and followed up with free ice cream. My overall experience left me so wanting more, that i returned several times before my voyage back to New York.  As New Yorkers we may not always give it up, but when credit is due, it aught to be handed. Lou Mitchell's made my Chicago experience that much more ""Chicago.""

But on off times the wait isn't so bad, and some of the waitstaff are really quite good, friendly and accommodating, including the hostess who seems to be there ALL of the time, the one that gives you the Milk Duds, but only to the ladies, and No you can't have mine!  (just love her...) Although, I shouldn't need to defend it too much, I mean, this is a Chicago institution and you need a little attitude with your eggs!  That being said, I ADORE their omelets! I would argue that you would be hard pressed to find a more wonderful breakfast-omelet with sliced-potato-hash-brownie-goodness, light and fluffy Greek toast with homemade marmalade and strong coffee... Does it get any better than that? And when it comes down to specifics, I'm thinking of the Greek sausage special omelet with feta... Oodles and oodles of melty warm feta cheese nestled in fluffy eggs...  Oh, and they make a pretty mean Ruben too, but skip the fries.",0.987,0.779,0.159,0.062,0.576423902894491
2008-12-02,5.0,"When October rolls around in odd numbered years I make my biennial pilgrimage to Chicago, IL in preparation for the two hour bus ride from the Windy City to South Bend, IN for the renewal of the USC vs. Notre Dame football rivalry. Part of the preparation for this epic journey is to eat as much quality food as possible. In a city filled with countless 5-star restaurants Lou Mitchell's has risen to the top as our most frequently visited Chicago eatery.  Since 1995, Lou Mitchell's has been our Friday morning breakfast spot. This is a critical meal because we need to have a hearty feast to carry us through the pep rally at the Navy Pier later that afternoon. This will also be the last formal breakfast before the trek along I-90 to the mecca of college football. [cue Lord of the Rings theme music]  What can I say about Lou Mitchell's that hasn't been said by the 116 people that have reviewed it before me? Every time I have had breakfast there I was crammed into a tiny booth that barely afforded me enough room to raise my fork to my mouth. The waitresses -all who seem to be well past retirement age- come across as surly but efficient. And I don't think the food has ever been brought to our table without a it being dropped on the table so carelessly that there wasn't a splash or a spill. I wouldn't stand for such service in most eateries but at Lou Mitchell's it's something I look forward to.  One of many redeeming qualities about Lou Mitchell's is the strength of their breakfast menu. I have never ordered the same thing twice but every time I leave this diner I wish that I didn't have to wait two years to have what I just had again. The Belgium Malted Waffle is light and airy and is served with real maple syrup (bonus points for that). I've tried the ham & cheese and the Denver omelettes and on both occasions couldn't finish either of them because they were so big. On my last trip I took a chance on the apple and cheese omelette. I'm a big fan of caramelized apples with sharp cheddar cheese but they didn't seem like an obvious choice for an omelette filling. But I am here to tell you that it works and works in a big way.  The apple and cheese omelette might be my first repeat dish. We've already started planning our 2009 trip to Chicago and everyone in our group has already spoken up to make sure Lou Mitchell's is on the schedule for Friday October 16th.

I don't want to point fingers but this Lou guy is trying to kill you. Any place that shoves donut holes and Milk Duds down your throat before you've ever even seen a menu is a bit questionable. To be honest, at first I actually admired the novelty... sometimes you're just in the mood to pander to your sweet tooth. Hell, I pander it out like Heidi Fleiss to the sugar pimps shamelessly. Unfortunately everything on the Lou Mitchell's menu follows suit with the same uber-greasy, uber-fatty, uber-sweet mentality.  I hear ya, you just want to soak up a little of last nights booze, right? Throw some good 'ol grease in the belly? I'm not passing judgement... why do you think I came here?!

I'm not sure what the deal was or how they prepare EGG WHITES - a supposedly healthy breakfast - but it was scary, disgusting and positively no cure for a hangover!!! Even my whole wheat toast was the 'Texas' version slathered in butter... apparently I ordered high cholesterol with a side of arrhythmia and just didn't realize it.

Also, cheese was extra, which I thought was odd for an omelette! The ""fresh"" orange slice was bitter and my roommate and I didn't care to finish it...

Whenever anyone comes into town, I take them here.  If they're new to the city, this is a great place to see a Chicago landmark (named to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006).  If they like the lure of Route 66, it's the first and last diner on it.  If they are into politics (as most of my friends are), it was the site of a very famous Bill Clinton photo op.  I also usually ""lie"" and say Barack Obama ate there.  I'm sure he must have at one point or another (most major Chicago politicians have when they have tourists in town). so I consider it a truth. Even when my parents came into town this week, though they're not really interested in any of the above, I took them to Lou Mitchell's because they arrived into Union Station and the restaurant is basically across the street.  When anyone I know has a stopover by train or bus in Chicago, I recommend it (despite the huge lines at lunch it's still usually possible to get in and out in less than an hour with the diner fast service). Yes, it doesn't take much to get me to take a tourist to Lou Mitchell's.  Because, beyond the fact that it's basically the most famous thing in downtown Chicago west of the Sears Tower (darn people who don't know about the Haymarket Riot), it's also a really good restaurant. It's not exactly Texas, but everything is a little bit bigger at Lou Mitchell's.  The toast is Texas sized Greek toast (smothered in butter).  The omelettes seem to be six eggs (and the feta cheese omelette which I particularly love is loaded with the stuff).  The only thing small is the free milk duds box they give to women on the way in (a vestige of their history) and the free donut hole they give to everyone. If anyone leaves Lou Mitchell's hungry, they're not really trying. Sure it's bad for the people who have to walk around and do touristy things after going there to be so full (especially if they ate the free prune appetizer), but I just go back to my office a couple of blocks away - smiling at the fact that I love a tourist trap so much.",0.9892,0.835,0.128,0.037,0.5110870610870611

My main meal was served in a skillit which I thought was a cool touch and my eggs ended up being 4 (double yolks) which just made me happy because I love poking the toast into my sunny side up eggs!

We then asked the other person who was in charge and she told us no such 4-or-more-at-patio rule. She told us to wait since it was full. We waited a few minutes and a table opened up. She told us to go ahead and sit at the table, and we did as told. Then the waitress came and told us we were not supposed to sit there. I told her that the lady inside told us to sit here. She walked to the table next to us and started telling her other customers that we DIDN'T wait in line for the table. She didn't try to find out the fact and had the audacity to accuse us for jumping the line. Of course I heard her, I turned around and fired back that I waited for 15 minutes before I got the table.

(and the coffee was good, bold and dark but good).  We ordered, and then around 20 minutes went by.....the place wasn't even full and we ordered biscuits and gravy! How long does it take to put two biscuits and a bowl of gravy on a plate?! I thought they might have been fresh-baking the biscuits but they weren't piping hot or anything when they came out.  Now here's where it really started to go downhill....by the time the food came I was done with my coffee....and it took until I was DONE with my food to even get a refill on the coffee. We never got a refill on the water. It took over 15 minutes from the time we told her ""we're done"" to even get the check. Then for two orders of biscuits and gravy and two coffees it was $21 before tip!  That's not even the worst part. The waitress yelled at us for not finishing our food! She came up and asked if we were ""slowing down"" and when we replied ""no, we're done"" she actually said ""That's a shame you two!"" and offered us doggie-bags TWICE as well as then mentioning it again when she brought the check and asking meagerly ""did you like it?"" like she was offended.

I ordered the $9.50 Sour Cream Special Omelette, a super-fluffy concoction with gobs of sour cream, bacon bits and chunks of fresh tomato. Rumor has it that they use double-yolk eggs to elevate the volume, and I believe it. As I remembered from my first and last visit two decades back, the eggs came almost overflowing in a skillet where they came accompanied with a hefty portion of pan-fried potato slices (see photo).

The breakfasts are legendary and many of their customers experienced this place on the weekends, as children, taken there by their parents to experience the ""legend"" of Lou Mitchell's, first stop on Route 66.  The omelets are HUGE, they give away donut holes and milk duds to people waiting in line, and they TRY to live up to their reputation, although NO RESTAURANT could live up to the hype that surrounds them.  Having said that, their food is HIGH QUALITY and served in abundance. If you were to eat there every day, you would end up weighing 800+ pounds. :-)  Still, it is worth checking out. The lines out the door are normally only on weekends. During the week, they are crowded, but  not to the point where people have to wait in lines. On Saturday and Sunday, the line can stretch out for half a block! If at all possible, experience this on a weekday, when there usually are no lines (although sometimes there are).  Not highlighted on the menu is the STEAK AND EGGS breakfast, which is absolutely phenomenal - a HUGE skirt steak - char grilled to perfection with three eggs, any style. Add a side order of hash browns and you have a meal that will cure ANY hangover! Their omelets are great - fluffy and loaded with enough meat and cheese to trigger spontaneous heart attacks. Their French toast is absolutely wonderful and their pancakes are good also. For lunch, I recommend the Royal Burger with Cheese. Their burgers are more like chopped steak than hamburger meat, and the buns are baked on premesis. The fries are fresh cut and juicy - tasty as hell, and totally not for dieters.  Even the salads are huge!  This is definitely NOT the place to eat if you are on a diet, and I'm sure that the Center for Science in the Public Interest (the place that tells us how unhealthy our diets are) has listed them as Public Enemy Number One, but if you just want great food and don't care about calories, this place is the bomb!

2006-05-12,3.0,"I used to love coming here when I was younger.  Whenever I came to Chicago for the day with my Dad we always made this place our first stop.  When I recently moved to Chicago I thought I would give this place a try again and was not that excited about it.  Maybe it was because I am a bit older and my tastes have changed, but greasy breakfast food just doesn't appeal to me as much as it once did.  On the plus side, the bakery items are homemade and every meal ends with some free ice cream.  A word of caution, all the eggs are double yolk so when you order 2 eggs you really are getting 4!",0.7371,0.909,0.064,0.027,0.3466666666666667
2006-03-29,4.0,"Yes- there is always a long line, but at least they give you donuts while you are waiting. I took my dad to this old fashioned diner last time he was in town and he loved it.  I had an omelet and was very happy with it. If it wasn't so far away I'd come here more often for brunch.",0.9286,0.81,0.19,0.0,0.5458333333333334
2006-02-18,5.0,"This is a big tourist attraction because of its history -- this location dates back to 1923! I went a couple times when I first moved to Chicago over 13 years ago, and was unimpressed. Something changed since then. They must have stopped using so much lard or butter to keep up with increasing health awareness, because the food is much less heavy and greasy, and they offer the omelettes with egg whites only.  Not that it's not still a calorie bomb. They still pass out the yummy donut holes, and the ladies still get the milk duds, and now they give free soft serve ice cream cones afterwards. The omelettes aren't as huge as I remember, but they're perfect. And the malted waffles are the best I've had.",0.9491,0.826,0.14,0.034,0.46249999999999997
2005-10-20,4.0,"This is an awesome breakfast spot!  They make the fluffiest omellettes I've ever seen and you can have them make it with egg whites only which is awesome if your'e trying to be healthy.  HOwever, being healthy here is hard beacuse their potatoes and toast  are awesome!!    They also give you a piece of orange and a prune which is a nice old school touch!  Their drawbacks are that the waitresses can be a tad aloof and rude, the prices are a tad high, and they only take cash!",0.9599,0.745,0.212,0.043,0.740138888888889

2005-07-22,4.0,The staff here actually seems like they want to come to work. They are friendly and accommodating through and through. My brother and I split an omelet and we still didn't finish our food (despite it's undeniable deliciousness). I was a little disappointed to look at the check and see that a side of bacon was $4 - the omelet itself was pretty reasonable however. The place gets insanely crowded on the weekends - and they pack 'em in - but it's still worth a visit.,0.6753,0.864,0.113,0.023,0.56875
2005-07-20,4.0,Seems like another blast from the past. Breakfast here is great. You get treats while you are waiting. Breakfast is hot and fresh and fills you up. And you get complimentary vanilla icecream to end your meal.,0.8957,0.737,0.263,0.0,0.5700000000000001
