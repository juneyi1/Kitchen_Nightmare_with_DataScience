2017-08-06,5.0,"My first huarache was a definite success. Think Mexican flatbread, with a fresh masa crust and salsa as the sauce. Yes, it's delicious. After consulting the internet, I opted for tinga (spicy chicken, which was absolutely divine) and nopales (cactus - trust me, it's delicious). Both were fantastic - flavorful and a great contrast with the crispiness of the crust. One huarache will feed even the hungriest person, and could easily be split as an entree for lighter eaters. I saw some quesadillas and other entrees come out, all looked delicious.

We stumbled upon this place some months ago after we moved to Andersonville and it is our go-to place when we want some quick Mexico City-style street food. Tacos, huaraches and sopes.

However, they are one of the few early places in Chicago to start making Huaraches, something that is far more common in Mexico than it is here. That also means that this is pretty authentic, and it shows. You won't see that many places that have done the fermented mushroom stuff either.  Food is fantastic, spices are excellent, but you'll definitely get a kick from a lot of the food. It's also a really small establishment, so there are only maybe 5 or 6 tables. As of from when this review was written to now, there are a number of places in the surrounding area that also make huaraches and this general style of central mexican cuisine.

Neither of us had ever heard of a huarache, so we paid this hole-in-the-wall a visit. Turns out a huarache is basically a Mexican pizza, with a corn tortilla for the base, refried beans for the ""sauce,"" and your choice of meat or vegetables, onions, cilantro, cheese, and red/green sauce as the toppings. We tried the pastor, (chicken) tinga, and chorizo. The pastor was bland, the chorizo was very flavorful, and the tinga was fine. The red sauce was spicier than green sauce. The huarache should be eaten relatively quickly because the tortilla gets soggy from the refried beans and or sauce and then falls apart. The prices are very cheap considering the amount of food you get.  We waited about 30 minutes for our food, and there were 3 orders in front of us. This restaurant is very small, maybe 10 seats, and doesn't have the greatest eat-in atmosphere, but it's a clean hole-in-the-wall establishment.

Now, the al pastor is a little different here and is more like a cross between tinga and al pastor, which results in a more stewy version. However, the sauce perfectly soaks into the masa.

The huarache was HUGE, the steak was fatty and the flavor was just okay. What made the huarache decent was the mixture of the chipolte and green sauce. However, the steak was too fatty for us to attempt to finish. Now the enchiladas were a lot better; the green sauce once again the star of the dish. It was served with yellow rice and refried beans, the beans were well beans and the rice was better than average. The milkshake as my husband put it was ""weak"" and it ""taste like nestle quick.""

The name was promising as well. I like restaurants that imply they have a legion of old ladies in the back working it out and making food that's old school, crazy delicious, comforting, and that will stick to your ribs. I was the teensiest bit scurred, however, because my latest run-ins with donas in the Chicago area had not ended well. At all. I shouldn't have been worried because this dona, likely, chased the other donas out of town. Delicious. This is delicious food without pretense or markup. Come here because you're hungry and appreciate home-cooked food for days. Don't come here to be seen or pontificate on foolishness. This is real. Come here to be real. As others have mentioned, this looks like a refurb'ed garden apartment, complete with steps that go down and low(er) ceilings. There are only, about, 5 tables in the joint and the majority are two tops. This isn't a spot that's good for large groups. It is, however, good for folks who like to eat. And, because the food is so affordable, you can eat a lot. Not knowing what huaraches were prior to coming, I thought it a good idea to order two kinds. Luckily, my dining Girl Friday was up to the challenge. Purpley agua frescas in hand, we settled in for al pastor and chicken huaraches, one with red sauce and the other with green. Do this. Try both sauces but be aware that they also come in bottles if you need more than what comes with the dish. As for huaraches... do you like gigantic pizza shaped orders of masa loaded down with meat, veggies, spice, sauce, and cheese? Do you like knowing there's a real live dona in the house going to town on your food (rather than having one in name only)? Do you like varieties of agua served in Big Gulp-sized jugs?

The word huaraches means sandals, but these babies are much larger than any non-NBA player size foot.  I'm giving it four stars because of the diversity of vegetarian toppings choices (you can get two or three toppings on your huarache for ~$7). But Mr. W did not think the al pastor and tinga was as good as the versions he orders at another local taqueria (he gave it three stars but I'm the one with the Yelp account).

It's not that it wasn't authentic, hand-made, or fresh. It just lacked flavor. How is this possible?!? I started to think that there was something wrong with me, maybe I lost the taste buds in my tongue, so I went to my spice rack and dumped an assortment of spices in my mouth. Nope, it wasn't me. Everything was working properly as I chewed and chewed thinking that there had to have been a better way to test my theory. Maybe it was an ""off"" day, it is good enough and right down the street from me, so I think it deserves another chance (which I don't give too often). *** They just had their windows busted, so they are boarded up.

We followed the suggestions of fellow yelpers and got two orders of Huraches. My husband got the Tinga (spicy chicken) and I got Rajas ( grilled poblano peppers with onion).  We also order a ""milkshake"" to split. Now perhaps there is a difference between what we think is a milkshake and what Mexico thinks is a milkshake. With that said, it was not a milkshake by our standards. What we got was chocolate milk. Which was tasty, but not exactly what we were expecting.  The huaraches were ginormous as promised and it was really nice to see everything being made right in front of you. When you put your order in they ask you what sauce you want and I asked for the least spicy of the bunch. That apparently is the green sauce. Which to me, a spicy light weight, was NOT mild nor medium. That bugger is HOT. And my husband got the red which is supposed to be hotter than the green. But he can handle that sort of thing better than I can. But he too said it was super hot. But he did finish his whole meal (within two days, it's impossible to eat one whole huarache in a sitting I think!)

2009-03-06,1.0,"I am Mexican.  Was born in Mexico.  Most of my family is still in Mexico. Have eaten D.F. style food before as half of my family lives there--This is NOT it. There are places in this city that do serve it so it is not, in fact, unrealistic to expect authentic Mexican food from el DF. I read the reviews last night.  I got sooooo excited.  I live in andersonville and so far Mexican restaurant after  Mexican restaurant around here has been a disappointment.  So really the bar wasn't set so high for this place to begin with.  But since I was in the mood for handmade huaraches and tortillas, my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try.  So we walked up clark to elmdale to try it out.  I really wanted to like this place because I grew up on the southside of Chicago and so far the majority of  Mexican food on the northside pales in comparison to some of my favorite places on the southside.   That said, I'm not sure what most of these reviews are talking about but my conclusion is this: yelpers are confusing handmade food with quality food.  Yes, the tortillas and masa are hand made.  But no, the food is not good.  My boyfriend ordered a huarache al pastor and I ordered a sope with picadillo and a taco de carne asada.  He ordered an agua de jamaica and I ordered an agua de tamarindo.  Here is my assessment of the food.  The masa is not great, it's not bad but it's not very good.  You can go to a Mexican store and buy some premade masa that is much better than the stuff they make here.   Why I didn't just go do that and save myself the stomach ache after going to this place is beyond me. The quality of their meat is terrible.  They use meat with too much fat which they then proceed to over cook until it's so dry that the only thing keeping it semi-moist is the grease it was cooked in. And the quality of the meat in general is really bad.  I know this is a taqueria but there are taquerias in this city that would never serve that kind of meat. The picadillo on my sope was not picadillo--it's basically ground up beef that was cooked.  FYI--picadillo is ground beef that is marinated and cooked in a very yummy sauce made from tomatoes, onions, sometimes nuts, olives, etc.  This was just ground beef that was overcooked as far as I could tell. They ask you if you want your choice of meat accompanied with red or green salsa, except if the picadillo had been made properly it wouldn't have needed a salsa. (that was the first red flag) The carne asada in my taco was so overcooked that only the grease was saving it from being completely dry.   The huarache al pastor that my boyfriend ate didn't taste like al pastor--in part because it was smothered in the red salsa that they recommend you order.  Again, if the al pastor had been made properly, there would have been no need for that crappy salsa. Moving on to the salsa. The red salsa  that they encourage you to order on everything  is so spicy that you can't possibly taste any of the other flavors (maybe bad, maybe good--who knows!) underneath it all.  I like spicy salsa's but this one had no flavor other than spicy.  Good salsa's are not just spicy but they are supposed to be layered with flavors.   The aguas were nothing to write home about either but they were probably the best thing I had in that meal.  The only other redeeming quality in this meal (in my case not so redeeming) is that they give you a lot of food.  I did my best to eat this food because i don't like wasting food  but it made me sick and it made my boyfriend, who has an iron stomach, sick as well.  I feel bad for writing my paisanos a bad review but it infuriates me when yelpers write good reviews about food they clearly know nothing about.",0.9869,0.807,0.116,0.077,0.4916100999694752

I'll definitely be back again.",0.9917,0.675,0.242,0.083,0.589551282051282

2008-02-21,5.0,"This tiny little place just opened close by.  Don't let the street view fool you. It's your basic taqueria atmosphere inside, but the food is far from basic. This is a great little family operation with killer food.  Everything is home made.  Even the tortillas for the huaraches and quesadillas are made as you order them.  The food takes a couple of minutes more, but the extra wait is worth it.    They deliver as well.",0.4118,0.786,0.123,0.091,0.41999999999999993
