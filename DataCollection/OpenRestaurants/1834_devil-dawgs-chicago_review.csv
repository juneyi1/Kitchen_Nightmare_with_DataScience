I was reluctant at first, because it's winter and this is a ""shack"" type establishment, the only sitting area is outside. But I decided to go and eat it elsewhere.  First off, the prices rock. You can get a burger for $2.40!! The fry and drink combo is only $2.99 and it's a fairly large drink & decent amount of fries. For a college student like myself and others in the Lincoln Park area that is usually an important factor!   The fries are the greasy ""fast food"" shack type that you somehow don't regret eating... However they are not TOO greasy or too salty, which is a plus. You can also get them in a bucket! The buckets are the bomb and can be made with a variety of different sauces.  The ""dawgs"" are the bomb and they have a variety of those as well, with cool names and toppings. The  Blue Demon's Dawg (represent!) for instance, comes with devil sauce, onion, sauerkraut, pickle, spicy mustard- my friends like that one.  You can get a Chicago style burger!  Parking sucks if you are driving and it would probably be a lot easier to eat in the outdoor area during the summer but other than that the place rocks!  The burgers are on the small side, but they are really cheap and soooo good so I think they are worth it. If you normally eat a whole/large burger I'd recommend getting 2!

2014-09-12,4.0,"On my recent [and first] trip to Chi-town, I was determined to try the pickle-rich, ketchup-free Chicago hot dog.  Yet with a short timetable and a laundry list of amazing food to try, this iconic tubed meat began to drift downward on my priority list. Unfortunately, our initial flight into O'Hare was cancelled! Bad weather or some such nonsense. With that, my food itinerary was in disarray. Plan A, B and C were not in the cards as we weren't going to get to the South Loop until 12:30AM at the earliest. The native-Angelino in me, familiar with the late-night food carts of Downtown LA,  instinctively reverted to Plan D, which obviously stood for ""Plan Dog"".  I performed a yelp search based on late-night eats in the South Loop and out popped Devil Dawgs.  After dropping our bags at the AMAZING Blackstone Renaissance Hotel , we took a 3 block stroll to just South of Polk on State street. It was nearly 1AM and only slightly drizzling. ""Don't ask for Ketchup...Don't ask for Ketchup"" I reminded myself as we entered the lively South Loop Devil Dawg location.  There are two devilish locations in the city - one in the South Loop near Columbia University and a plethora of art colleges and the other in Lincoln Park, home of DePaul University. Cheap and Unique are the two factors which make for a successful college-oriented food business -- Devil Dawgs has mastered both. With reasonable prices and three towering menus of both traditional and progressive dawg preparations to choose from, Devil's has established itself as today's go-to quick dog and a late-night staple. Also noteworthy, Devil's is one of the only vendors in the city to use Chicago Red Hots for their sausage varieties.  Oh how I had dreamt of the first bite! A juicy dog topped with mustard, tomatoes, a pickle spear, relish, onions, sport peppers and celery salt enveloped by a poppyseed bun! Being a bona fide pickle head, I was dazzled by this vinegar-heavy approach to tubed meat. It's right up their with Banh Mi as one of my favorite eats below $3. Yet, to my surprise, this wasn't the star of the Devil Dawg show.... Seoul Dawg! An unforgettable Chicago Red Hot topped with Shoyu Mustard and Kimchi! So good, it could rightly be used as a tool to bring about world peace. The heat of the red hot, savory acidity of the mustard and sour/fermented touch of the kimchi came together as a harmonious symphony in my mouth! In truth, Devil's WAS a last resort for us last Friday; however, it was one of those happy accidents which re-ignited my desire to live in the moment and stray from researched food once in a while.",0.6802,0.839,0.086,0.075,0.5580429732868758

2013-01-10,3.0,"Wow, it feels really good to cross off one of the oldest bookmarks in my queue (I really am keeping my new year's resolutions!) which had been there since Time Out Chicago's ""Best Things We Ate"" 2010 version. Made my way to DD yesterday evening, fully intending to eat there, but we had to take our food to go. As in *had* to--there's literally no seating AT ALL, save for a picnic table or two outside which wasn't really conducive on an evening in January (and yes, I know it was 45 degrees yesterday, but still). I recalled from the TOC list that ordering a single steak burger was, well, in order, so I opted for that. Then I saw the size and description: a 2 oz. burger?! Yes, apparently. These things are tiny, like if White Castle and Five Guys had a baby, these burgers would be it. I ended up ordering a double, hoping that would suffice (since a triple sounded piggish), my bf ordered a ""Blue Demons Dawg,"" (a nod to nearby DePaul who I imagine gives them tons of business) and a bucket of fries. In an ode perhaps to White Castle, they combine their ketchup and mustard into one brown, unappealing (at least looks-wise) sauce. I enjoy both ketchup and mustard on my burgers but I actually like to see the two different colors. Call me anal, but the two condiments taste completely different, and mixed together is just not good. This was especially true when I noted that DD uses the dreaded Red Gold brand of ketchup and not Heinz. Heinz is king. End of. By default, they put onions on the burgers, but they're raw and not cooked, so if you don't want them, speak up as I did. I also had a sneaky suspicion that the fries sitting in the holding pan had been there a while, but I didn't want to be a bitch and ask for fresh fries; in hindsight, I should have, because I may have been right. Anyway, like I said, we had to take our food home with us (so it's a good thing we don't live too far away) and naturally the fries were cold and limp by the time we unpacked our food. A quick reheat in our toaster over (don't ever microwave fries!) rendered them back to almost what I presume is their original glory. Excellent fries (twice-cooked if I'm not mistaken): crispy, thin, and salty, just like I like 'em. The burger was good, tasty even, but if you're like me and used to a bigger piece of meat (wait, what?), then these diminutive burger patties may not appeal to you. Still, for what it was, it was enjoyable, and I'm told that the dog was deeply satisfying as well (they don't serve Vienna hot dogs, but the South Side brand ""Red Hot Chicago"") with its ""devil sauce,"" kraut, and spicy mustard. I liked Devil Dawgs just fine. It was cheap eats and friendly service, but a few things annoyed me (lack of seating, no Heinz ketchup).

It also includes mustard, pickle and celery salt. The Chicago dog was unimpressive. Everything was fresh, but I've had better at O'Hare airport (no joke). The coney dog was somewhere in between. The coney sauce was a little sweet, which caught me off guard, but I think I liked it. It could have used more onions.

Devil Dawgs is a hot dog joint first (as the name would imply) but a serious eats writeup praised the burgers more and that's what I came for. The lowdown- good, but small as others have said.  Unfortunately, nothing else at this place did much for me. It might be because after being recommended the polish, it was served cold. My friend's hot dog was a similar situation. In addition to being gross to taste, I can only imagine how long these were sitting around. The fries were good (although I might dispute the employee's claim that they're the only fresh cut fries in the city- c'mon son). The cheese sauce is standard liquid cheese they apply by the gallon. It's no different than what is served at 99% of hot dog joints in the city. Just a big mess. Perhaps I expected more than I should of out of a hot dog joint. Devil Dawgs, I hardly knew you.

I only had one beer in me and McGee's' kitchen had just closed, so my boyfriend and I went to go find a place we spotted while on our way to the bar. Lo and behold, we fell upon (well, walked, we really weren't drunk) the steps of Devil Dawgs, a place that would forever change my life in food terms. The wait was a tad long considering there were no people in front of us, but perhaps that was a good thing because we ended up getting freshly fried french fries. OH MY GOD The french fries. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't stop eating them. They were just plain fries, but they were the most delicious, perfectly fried and cut fries I'd ever had. They were the blissful combination of not too salty, with a hint of sweetness. I like my fries not too thin, not too think, and soggy, and that's exactly how they were. You must TRY the FRIKIN FRIES. I've had McDonald's, Burger King's old and new fries, Wendy's' old and new fries, other restaurants', bars', fast food places', and hot dog joints' fries, and I don't know what Devil Dawgs did that night, but it was love at first taste.  You may be wondering why I knocked a star off. Well, it was pretty cold out, and there's not so much as a single seat inside, so luckily they still had their seating set up outside (we don't have the luxuries of a car to sit in), so that was half a star because I realize it's a costly endeavor to remodel in such a way as to accommodate seating in such a small place. Another half of a star was off because the hot dogs we had weren't quite anything super unique or out-of-this-world tasty, but pretty good. (I had the hot dog with melted cheese and bacon. I forget what it's called). I would certainly go here again. It kind of sucks that it's so far away from where I live (on the opposite side of the city, practically), because now whenever I go out for a night of drinking I want to go here, too :(",0.9922,0.767,0.161,0.072,0.5509279727364834

Since all I have to go on is the fries-- let me describe them in extreme detail. They are a little bit darker in color which initially worried me, since I tend to like lighter colored fries, and a darker color suggests potato skin-on and also may suggest burnt fries.  No worries friends!  They were not burnt nor was there 100% skin on.  There may have been some skin on but not enough to bother.  They were perfectly greasy and crunch, and PERFECTLY salty.  It is hard to master salt, let me tell you.  Fries are usually too salty (like say a mcdonalds fry) or not salty enough (like steak and shake or in n out).  They came in a brown bag with MY NAME ON THE BAG, just like my mom used to give me when I was a child and brought a lunch to school!!!! (except my mom was like, here's some bread and cheese and a marker, do it yourself).  Nonetheless it was nostalgic and TRULY a beautiful experience.

Hours are late on the weekends, so I am sure there is high traffic from Kelley's and McGees late-night. Looking forward to going back and trying the fries.",0.8166,0.834,0.121,0.045,0.5855622895622895
2010-02-10,4.0,"I was a little skeptical at first because the place used to be a dry cleaners and looked a little cramped with all of the restaurant equipment jammed inside. I went in for a try and was surprised at how good the food was. It's a little small inside but well worth it because the hot dogs are only $2 and the fries (a large portion) are under $2. The Chicago style hot dogs are good and the fries were hand-cut, seasoned and delicious.  They are open pretty late and is good for late night munchies. They have a couple of tables for outdoor seating in warm weather, but besides that, it's basically a take-out place. If you're looking for cheap eats, this is a great place to try.",0.9861,0.755,0.234,0.011,0.6100732600732599

2010-01-26,4.0,"This is a great Chicago Hot Dog stand.  1) It serves a great Chicago hot dog.  It is fresh and complete with all the fixings (including sport peppers which I leave off) served up quick. The hot dog is a Chicago Red Hot brand which was started by the grandson of the Vienna Hot Dog founder.  It snaps when you bite into it.  Great!  2) The fries are hand cut and par boiled, which makes them crispy on the outside, tender and non-greasy on the inside.  Great!  I've not yet tried them cheese and chili, as I am a bit of a purist.  The staff has been good and attentive.  You watch them dress the dogs so if they aren't doing it the way you want it, just ask.  I would give them 5 stars if they has two seats in the place, but its a shack so I'll have to wait til summer to eat at the picnic tables they have ready to go outside.  This is great addition to the neighborhood, especially since Demon Dogs closed.  It's new so we have to patronize it to let it get established.  And for two bucks a quarter you can't beat it.",0.9715,0.859,0.128,0.013,0.5933884297520661
2010-01-11,2.0,"Stopped in with my boyfriend.  I asked for Chicago dog, no peppers, he got the coney dog and we both got cheese fries.  Our order was repeated back to us exactly as we had ordered it. Since there is literally nowhere to sit (or stand and wait for your order for that matter) we grabbed our bag of food and headed back to the car.  Opened bag-missing my Chicago dog.  My bf went back, and told them we were short a dog, they agreed to make it right away and he added, no peppers.  The girl behind the counter said, ""oh thanks for letting me know that!""  We get home and guess what-peppers on my dog. With that being said, my dog was fairly good.  My bf, however, hated the coney dog.  He said it was so gross.  As for the fries, I didn't realize they were hand cut-my absolute least favorite kind of fry.  I was super disappointed, but if you like that kind of fry, I guess this would be a plus for you. All in all, the dog I had was ok, but since I hate the fries, I doubt I'll be back for one lousy dog when there are plenty of other places in the area that have my kind of french fries.   By the way, parking will definitely be a problem is DePaul is in session.  Walk if possible.",-0.8963,0.804,0.077,0.119,0.4991622574955909

I always fear either the elderly turning blind corners or the always terrifying Freshman coed texting while driving, these are always prevalent in the area.  So I wandered into the brightly colored establishment and ordered up your standard Chicago Dog, or dawg in this case.  I was floored(maybe that's generous)  this is a great dog.  They set it up with all the usual fixins but the relish really stands out, it is superb on par with the best in town.  The non Vienna beef red hot was a nice change of pace from the usually Vienna Beef standard. The prices are superb 2.00 for a basic dog and 2.25 for the Chicago Dog.  The staff is courteous and friendly and your dog comes out quick. Their is no where to sit exactly so its in and out and on to the next stop. Overall in the top tier of dogs in the city a must visit",0.9854,0.726,0.182,0.092,0.4907142857142857

2009-11-28,4.0,"I would consider myself a hot dog connoisseur. Chowing down at places like Hot Dougs and the new...wonderful Chicago's Dog House is somewhat of a hobby of mine. The various specialty dogs (alligator, duck, bison) and wacky and superb toppings (avocado mayonnaise, homemade hot sauce) are usually what I scarf down. However a regular chicago dog or chicago polish is always a necessary break from the gourmet dogs.  So when i stepped into the small Devil Dawg diner and saw the giant blackboard overhead with only 5 types of dogs it was a welcome surprise. I ordered the chicago polish and I have to say it was one of the best I have had in the city to date, though 20 years of eating polish's won't dent the amount I have yet to try.  POLISH The polish came with a bevy of grilled onions draped over some mustard and small sport peppers(i hate when the sport peppers are so big that you have to attempt to bite them in half and end up making a big mess). The polish has a great casing that keeps the meat inside extra juicy and flavorful. It reminded of the dogs that Demon Dogs used to dish out under the fullerton L stop ~~RIP~~ The bun is nothing worth mentioning other than typical chicago dog-bun (AKA GREAT) Overall a great choice if your going to be pigging at Devil Dawgs.  My pops joined me on the adventure and went with the generic chicago dog that was ""anything but generic."" Quality meat, typical bun, and all the condiments you could ask for, nothing better. We both got ""the meal"" which is around 5 fat ones a piece. Includes a soda.... can or fountain, dog, and fries. And I let me tell you about dem fries. Soooooo good, greasy, salty, homemade, nothing more you could ask for. The grease is worth mentioning twice... amazing. Lets just say if your getting a dog get the fries, no joke. Very few downsides to this place... having said that here's why it doesn't deserve 5 stars. - No seats inside - Maybe room for 6-8 people to fit comfortably while ordering - The polish dog i ordered had already been grilled and was sitting on      the side of the grill-top. They grilled it some more to warm it up. I didn't mention it before because the taste of the polish justified what i saw when i was ordering - There are two picnic tables outside and i do not mean to be a crybaby but my dad and I had trouble telling each other how great the food was because of the train racing by overhead. THAT IS ALL This place reminds you why Chicago and especially Lincoln Park is the home to some of the best hot dogs in the world. You won't find any dolphin or duck in these dogs but what they lack in gourmet(and seats) they make up for in taste, service, and the traditional chicago way of eating Hot Dogs. Definitely going back as soon as possible to try the other dogs.  D E L I C I O U S",0.9901,0.845,0.111,0.044,0.5144632331270264

I also love not having to travel across the city for one, because you know sometimes at 3pm on a tuesday you just want some meat and a bun to take you through to dinner.... Alas, devil dawgs is here.

I got home at 1am last night and the place was packed - which made me happy to know they are open late :) cause you know sometimes i like to snack! haha Anyway, if you are in the area, hit it up - and you can bring a polish to me on your way to the el :)",0.9953,0.727,0.244,0.028,0.7025252525252526
