I tried explaining to her that I was waiting for a group, to which she responded by saying that I could sit at the bar while I was waiting... I don't want to sit at the bar... I have a group coming... things got awkward.  For at least 20 minutes towards the end of trivia I wanted to order more beer, but I saw her standing off to the side, on her phone.  I didn't want to go to the bar and order a beer and risk getting yelled at for ordering from not her.  It's too bad that she was such a frustrating part of the experience because the rest of the bar seemed great.

2017-04-24,3.0,"Have had this place on my wing radar for a while, and finally having car access for a day I made the trip to try them out. Luckily it was Monday so there was the famous 25-cent wings deal, and got two orders, Hot and Chipotle BBQ. This place has won a few awards for their wings and after having a taste of them, honestly I'm having a hard time thinking why. Not to say that they were bad by any sense, but the two flavors I tried were largely pretty average. Texturally they were crispy, made in the variety of frying the skin without a coating and then saucing afterwards. I have nothing against this style but some of the smaller wings suffered from this as it made them more susceptible to becoming dry during the frying process. As for the sauces, they were pretty indistinguishable from any other hot or bbq sauce at any corner bar. While I didn't try their other options, these two seemed to be some of the most popular, and I wasn't particularly impressed. 25 cent wing Mondays seems like a dream, but remember you have to get a drink with each order of 10 which largely balances out the value. I came for lunch and having to drive afterwards decided to just stick to getting a soft drink, thinking that it would be $2, $2.50 max. Bill comes and each Coke ended up being $3.50, so just be wary that even on Mondays you'll end up minimum $6 per order of wings(or probably closer to $8-9 if you choose to get a beer like most do). Still, at the end of the day I got 2 sodas and 20 wings for $12 on Monday, so if I need a wing fix and I'm in the area during the start of each week, I'd come back. But if there were a wait, or it was a trek, I probably wouldn't feel the need to go out of my way.",0.9635,0.872,0.095,0.033,0.6430860805860805

Unlike nearby Monty Gael's or most pubs they don't provide prices for beers and they don't post their specials in any way that's accessible when you're in the bar. They have a poster board but it only displays the specials they decide to advertise, which can be misleading because you *think* you're seeing today's special but you're not. You can check their rotating LCD outside or ask your server, but otherwise you won't be getting a special and you won't know how much you're paying for beer. For low quality food, I don't like to have to go out of my way and kowtow just to discover the price. Not a big fan.",0.1606,0.842,0.078,0.08,0.4067857142857142

Bartender Erich makes my martinis just the way I love them without me even having to explain it anymore. Servers Jessie and Brittney are friendly and efficient. They don't even have to write down my orders to remember them!

She goes and takes a bit to come back with one, leaves and comes back 5 minutes later to take our order, all at the same time because we wanted to take advantage of her at our table, since it took her so long to come back. (4 beers, 4 waters, 2 appetizers and 4 entrees). Our beers took at least 20 minutes, the appetizers came out 5 minutes later, along with one of the entrees. A few minutes later two more of the entrees came... Still no waters, so we ask again. 5 minutes goes by and then 3 waters come out, again there are 4 of us. 10 minutes after the first three entrees came out, the 4th came. we again ask for the 4th water. Our waitress came around at one point to ask if we needed anything, which was surprising because it was the first time she acknowledged our presences since she ordered our food (someone else delivered everything) We asked for ketchup because the one at the table was empty. She brought one to us quickly, first time the entire experience something didn't take over 10 minutes. And to top it all off, she apologizes for the empty ketchup bottle. To quote ""I'm so sorry"". It is dumbfounding that's what she apologizes for.. not the service, or lack thereof, not for our mediocre food, or for bringing everything out at the same time. saves it for when it really matters; the empty ketchup bottle.

You can also order a pitcher of soda for $10 which gets you four orders of wings (40) at the special price.  The special is not really a special, we ended up spending way more than we expected to.  You are basically out $7 for two cans of pop if you want more than one flavor of wings.

Initially got a little hesitant because of the crowd outside but when we walked in the management told us it was a 30 minute wait for a table or we could sit at the bar. The bartender was nice and explained how the special worked. We ordered the Hot, Chipotle BBQ, and BBQ wings. All of the wings were meaty, flavorful, and much larger than other establishments. We also ordered the Wild Fries, they are hands down the best creation made! The price is also very reasonable, 20 cent wings, beers range from $5-8, and the wild fries were $6. There were a variety of beers from all over the nation, the Green Flash American IPA was great. Highly recommend this bar/grill!",0.9882,0.777,0.215,0.008,0.46714663643235066

Food is decent - their wings are really good - and drinks are fine.  The lose a star because service can be painfully slow on nights (order-2-drinks-at-a-time slow) where there are a couple of games on (Hawks, Bulls most recently). For some reason, they don't get that they should supplement their existing staff on these busy nights.  They gain a star because of their no kids after 8 policy. One weeknight game night, a guy was their with his 2 young kids - probably around 7 and 4 I'd say - they had clearly finished eating, it was around 8:30, and the guy (I'm guessing their dad) was watching the Hawks game, while his kids were clearly bored, kinda messing with their drinks, and small toys that they had. It looked to me like they were whining to their dad to leave, too (having 3 kids, I know what bored, whiny children look and sound like....). This went on for 15-20 minutes before they finally left. I know this because we were watching them, waiting for their table to open up :) I don't come here enough to know often kids are here, but it seems like it's been enough of an issue for a policy to be implemented.

Yes, of course Yelp is all about patron opinions in regards to goods and services and Yelpers can see a mile away false reviews, and by the looks of people who press the Useful button on my review, well... yeah.  Also, it is okay to pull together all your experiences with a certain business in one review, so me bringing back the flashback on the tip I posted beforehand is completely okay in the Yelp community, am I right fellow Yelpers and Elites? As for the Monday night ""rules"" management says we disregarded, maybe they should post them on the menu instead of harassing (not ""informing nicely"" as they want to paint it) customers who are taking two wings home. As they said, I was already leaving with mom and grandma, when a man almost a foot taller than us blocked the exit making us stay against our will as he raised his voice to intimidate us.

2015-05-01,5.0,"I've been coming to the Goose for just over a year now, and there's a litany of reasons why I keep returning. The service is exceptional. The girls behind the bar can multitask in a way that's unparalleled, pouring a beer with one hand, shaking a martini with the other hand, and charming the customers at the bar with smart banter all the while. It's a full bar, and the draft beer selection rotates fairly regularly, but standbys are always kept in stock, such as Vandermill, Lauganita's Lil' Sumpin, and Half Acre's Daisy Cutter. (The latter of whom are our neighbors!) If you prefer old favorites such Bud/Miller/Coors/PBR/etc., though, they've got bottles and cans locked and loaded for you.  The food is great, too, featuring one of the best burgers I've had in the city, delicious wraps, fried calamari, exceptional potato skins, and daily specials throughout the week. And, oh man - the soup. The chef makes some of the best chicken noodle soup I've ever had in my life. No frills, just quality ingredients and love. The Wild Goose is a sports bar, with a bunch of TVs mounted all around the circumference of the dining room, along with a few pull-down projector screens for big events, as well as Golden Tee and darts. I ordinarily don't frequent sports bars, because I don't follow sports with the tenacity that a lot of us do, but I've actually begun to take an interest in just about every sport out there, because there's a different game/event shown on each TV, and there are happy customers full of esoteric and fascinating sports knowledge, hanging out every time I'm there. And if there's a game you want to see, just ask one of the servers or the bartender, and they'll find your game for you. I suffer from fairly severe anxiety, but every time I leave the Goose, I feel phenomenal. The staff, the customers, and the atmosphere are all therapeutic in a way that would take a published essay to describe. I hate to even allude to the Cheers metaphor, but every time I walk in to the Goose, I my hand starts to hurt after high-fiving and handshaking so many of the regulars and staff, all of whom have become life-long friends.  If you're ever in Northcenter, or live in Northcenter, come to the Wild Goose, and it will soon become your local. They have regulars who live as far south as Bridgeport and as far north as Skokie, and I'm sure even wider. I have no intention of moving away from Chicago anytime soon, but if I ever do, I'm heading straight from O'Hare to the Goose whenever I visit.",0.9943,0.792,0.151,0.057,0.531825813075813
2015-05-01,5.0,"The Wild Goose is a fun neighborhood establishment. The last time I ate here, I ordered their HOT wings (which are wildly popular) with blue cheese dip--really delicious with their mildly crunchy skins smothered in flavorful hot sauce. The wings are a reasonable size too. Even though the Wild Goose has ""ten-cent wing night"" on Mondays, I try to avoid that day, since its really crowded, instead I go Thursdays where all appetizers are 4 bucks, and you have a little more breathing space between seats. Other times, I have ordered their beer-battered onion rings, which are huge, crunchy, and really filling. Another ""don't miss"" are their potato skins: topped with bacon, cheese and chives, and a dollop of sour cream. Really good burgers, and sweet potato tater tots are my favorite! For a sports/drinking establishment, their food is notches better than others. And check out their impressive menu: Cajun Tuna Steak,--c'mon! I've never tried, but I always like to check out whats new on the menu. I also just  popped in this Sunday after work to chill out for a bit, and it seems like thats the day regulars pop in, and it was actually pretty laid back. I thought it might be busier with non-neighborhood people, but the regulars kept the atmosphere unwound--nice for a Sunday, late afternoon.

I said ""I understand, I just didn't know if  there were people ahead of us or if we would get tht table.  She assured me there was no one waiting and we would get the table.

It was highlighted on the show for it's ""all you can eat"" fish fry. Time to try it. This place is fairly large for a neighborhood sports bar. Tables are on a first come, first served basis. If it's crowded, start looking for a table that looks like they are finished eating. When they leave, grab it, but it may take awhile to be cleaned. Our server was nice and pleasant, but seemed a little overwhelmed with her station. Maybe they were shorthanded, and she had too many tables, as I only saw one other waitperson within our vicinity. Not a big deal, but service was a little slower than it should have been. Now on to the fish fry special...$7.95 is a great price just about anywhere. The fish is hand cut Cod, with a light beer batter. Served warm to hot, without a searing and painful first bite that happens with most fried fish just delivered to your table. Apparently the kitchen staff is letting it cool before plating, as it was the perfect temperature on the second helping too. Or, maybe we just got lucky with the timing, twice. Either way, good fish, but a little oily on the batter. I would still give it a thumbs up! The fish fry special comes with french fries, green peas and cole slaw. The fries were the worst thing on my platter. They were under cooked, not warm and bland. I am not being a big french fry eater, mainly because there are a lot of crappy fries being served out there. When you get good fries, you know it. The peas and slaw were good, but not much served, and I believe there were no second helpings available. The cole slaw came in a small plastic container...like you would put ketchup in, or soy sauce for take-out sushi. It was one fork full...a.k.a. ""one bite"". Maybe most people come for the fish and don't eat the sides, but I could have eaten more peas and slaw. From a food cost standpoint...these are not a high cost items, so I would expect more or second helpings on an all you can eat. Would go back again for the fish, and probably order a side salad to accompany my dinner.",0.9961,0.79,0.17,0.04,0.4871180555555555

It obviously wasn't so I immediately ran outside and placed my order, apologizing for the noise level, saying I was next door. Well, I went to go pick up the fries 10 minutes later and the waitress was very rude to me. She complained to me about how noisy it was, even though I fixed it right away. I apologized again and then got my food. Got back to Half Acre and oh look- I got super, super jipped. Normally their to-go box is totally full- almost heavy- of cheese fries. It was barely halfway full and cold. What usually feeds 8 fed 2. I'm thinking okay, that can't be it. But there was such a small amount that we had to get more 10 minutes later, so my friend just went over to make the order. She came back with a HUGE amount - the normal amount of fries, which were warm and great. It just made me mad.

2013-06-26,5.0,"As long time yelp lurker, I signed up simply because this place needs to get another good review. I am not a fan of long reviews, but this review is going to need to explain a few things. The Wild Goose really earned my respect.  I came here looking for a simple place to get dinner on a quiet Tuesday night. There were a few families eating dinner, a few people drinking at the bar, and a few couples having drinks and food. All we wanted was a place we could eat and talk. The music here was not too loud, so that was perfect (and it earned instant bonus points from me). We seated ourselves and within a minute or two a waitress brought us menus and had taken our drink orders.  We ordered a salad, an appetizer (fries with cheese, chili powder, ranch dressing, and jalapenos), 10 medium buffalo wings, and a buffalo chicken wrap.  1) The service was great! Our waitress was back-and-forth past our table often (even though she had at least 5 groups that she was working), and she was attentive to our desires (including changing an order after it was put in). 2) The house salad was large. It was plenty for two people to share, and it could have been a meal for one person. The greens were very fresh, it was not iceberg lettuce, and the dressing was homemade. It was a great deal.   3) The french fry appetizer was exactly what it sounds like. It was a deliciously sloppy mess of yum. It too was huge. It was plenty for two or three people to share.  4) My wings were very large wings, and 10 seemed like a generous portion size. Again I simply thought it was a lot of food for the price considering the late uptick in the cost of things along that stretch of Lincoln.  5) The buffalo chicken wrap came with a side of fries and a couple of pickle slices... just like all the other items, it was a large wrap. Now, here comes the kicker with this place. This is the reason that I will give this place 5 stars, and the reason I truly thinks it deserves a little something extra. I take a medicine that makes it very hard for me to eat. Since I often have this trouble, the times when I do get hungry, I get quite hungry. I was starving when I entered this restaurant/bar, and when I ordered the food I decided I was going to get plenty of food and totally fill up. From the short period of time between me ordering the food, and the time when the main courses came, I totally lost my desire to eat anything. For that matter, I got nauseated and felt the need to leave as soon as we could.  I called the waitress over and told her that we wouldn't be leaving and that we would like our check. She was very concerned over the fact that we hadn't eaten our food. I told her that the kitchen hadn't done anything wrong, and that we simply weren't able to eat right then. Then, despite the fact that we had finished our drinks (non-alcoholic), enjoyed the salad, started the fries, and we were simply walking out on our own dinner... SHE COMPED THE ENTIRE MEAL! They did something that some places would have done had we been disgusted with the food or had we complained. But, considering the situation, they went above and beyond the call of service. They passed what anyone should expect at any dining establishment. As a restaurant they may be a bar... but today they were a five star bar.",0.995,0.837,0.12,0.043,0.4958766233766234

2012-09-27,4.0,A girlfriend and I stumbled on this place one Monday afternoon. We just finished getting pedicures and were looking for a snack and adult beverages. The first place we went too was closed and we saw this place across the street. It was about 2PM and this place was pretty hopping.  There beer selections is pretty awesome. Lots to choose from on tap and in bottles. They also had a lot of different fun mixed drinks including some signature martinis. We settled on some beers and appetizers. We ordered the Spinach and Artichoke dip that was served with chips. This was on point good. The thing that we liked best about it was it wasn't runny like other dips that at other establishments. You know what I'm talking about...it almost as if you're just eating cream of spinach and artichokes with chips. Don't get me wrong I love cream of spinach but not when I'm expecting a dip. This was a great consistency that actually had cheese holding it all together. I'm a fan.  The other item we ordered was the Beer Battered Onion Rings. Holy moly these were so finger licking delish! I've had some good onion rings but these were so different from others that I've had. The batter was almost like pancake and it was just the right thickness. The best part is that there was a spicy taste in every bite. We couldn't quite figure out what it was but it was so good.  Service was decent. She was attentive and I didn't get irritated because we didn't get enough attention. Like I said it was pretty busy for an early Monday afternoon. I noticed that they had a lot of accolades for their chicken wings.

I don't understand why any manager would tell their server to show up to work after they were in a serious car crash. Anyway.. the reason this place is getting 2 stars is because the food was awful. I got ten wings since everyone told us that this place was all about delicious wings. My wings were awful and dry. I ate one.

I've never actually been to this place other than on a Monday, which is when they have their 10 cent wing deal, but it's safe to say I've had most of their stuff and it's all good.

Of course like any bar, this place does tend to get crowded fast. I'd recommend getting there by around 6 so you'll get a seat quickly, and unless you're a football fan I'd avoid it completely during game season because you will spend your evening staring at the guy who is supposed to be seating you.

TVs. And lots of them; (3)  Dos Equis on tap; and; (4) walking across the street and pick up my groceries at Jewel afterwards.  Things I hate about Wild Goose:  waiting for a table on Monday nights.  Unless you're super aggressive or drunk and willing to get in someone's face for stealing your table, try to get there before 5:00pm.  There's absolutely no order whatsoever for table seating.  Actually, thats about it.  The crowd is pretty normal/typical and laid back, and completely unlike some bar scenes you'll encounter in Wrigleyville or Lincoln Park.   If you want to go somewhere to watch a ""big game"" then go to Wild Goose.",0.4901,0.765,0.132,0.103,0.5386099865047235

Okay, so I'm dating a Bengals fan.  I know, I'm not happy about it either.  Unfortunately for him, Bengals games are hardly ever broadcast in Chicago.  Unfortunately for me, the Bengals bar is in Lincoln Park.  This past Sunday we were able to compromise on The Wild Goose for football watching because I didn't feel like going all the way to Kendalls to watch the game and the Bears weren't playing, so I didn't care all that much.  When we got to Wild Goose at about noon there were still plenty of tables left (I doubt that would have been true had the Bears been playing).  Wild Goose was broadcasting every NFL game and the tvs were even marked with cute little signs indicating which game was on which tv.  The Bengals game was only on one screen that was weirdly positioned, but when we asked the waitress to please change the nearest screen to the game she agreed (and even changed the signs!  and no one was watching the Steelers, anyway...) The waitress then informed me that one of the Sunday specials was a $3 Bloody Mary bar, which I was all over.  She quickly brought me a glass with a fairly generous helping of vodka and off I went to concoct my (slightly horseradish heavy, admittedly) drink.   For $3 this was actually a pretty impressive bar - standard Bloody Mary mix, but lots of spices and sauces, olives, celery, peppers and, in a cool and unusual addition, beef jerky. The food we ordered, nachos and quesadillas, was just okay.  The quesadillas were marginally above average for bar food, the nachos marginally below - both were pretty cheap, around $6.   Our sever continuously popped by the table and was just all around sweet and attentive.  The other patrons were also very cool - Wild Goose seems like a real neighborhood place that probably gets a lot of the same regulars every Sunday.  Several of them asked us if we were Bengals fans, to which I vigorously shook by head ""no"".   I recently commented to several friends that I've been really disappointed in the Lincoln Square bar/restaurant offerings overall.  Wild Goose was a pleasant surprise and is definitely my current #1 choice for a sports bar in the area.",0.9846,0.779,0.142,0.079,0.5621929824561401

The condiments that I had asked for were no where to be found.   I finally was able to track down the bartender so that she could get me what I had asked for.  The burger was very plain and it didn't have much flavor.  Not quite sure how a turkey burger could be this bad.  At this point, the bar started to fill up because of a basketball game.  My coke remained unfilled until I was almost finished with my meal.  I hardly touched the potatoes and ate only half of the burger.  She didn't even ask how things were. With all this being said, I wouldn't suggest going there with high expectations.  If you are looking for below average food and service then this may be the place for you.  I don't see a return visit anytime in the near future.  With so many great places similar to this one in Chicago, why settle for second best?",0.9253,0.872,0.088,0.04,0.510095785440613

They have your everyday variety of bucket beers and daily drink specials. That being said, it's nothing special in my opinion but they pretty much have everything you need whether you're there solo or with a much larger group. Their menu is quite the delight, my main favorite being the beer battered onion rings, fries, and chicken strips. Those three alone are quite the fille for even your trifecta, so be forewarned if you order more than that. I ended up ordering those two as well as a burger, and I ended up taking home quite a lot. Seating is a plenty, with plasma screens throughout. I get the sports bar vibe, but it doesn't reek of fraternity bros getting slammered here.

Then as she spoke to answer my question about specials I smelt peppermint. So I took another look at the ""gowder"" and discovered a very familiar shape. The gowder was actually a mini candy cane she had shoved into the side of her mouth. How RUDE!!  My friend and I ordered burgers 1 medium and 1 medium rare they both arrived well done. Super Crispy like black on the outside grossness. But they were only $2 so I guess we shouldn't have expected much.  We ordered black velvets(Half Cider / Half Guinness) and the bartender didn't even bother to use a spoon to separate the two beers. She just mixed em which is just a bad way to tend bar skills and really ruins the drink. Oh and when we needed refills the waitress was too busy playing darts with a co-worker so we had to wait til we could flag her down on her way to another table.

2008-08-27,5.0,"You might recall that I wandered into the premises of this venue late one afternoon earlier this year only to learn (directly) that it was closed for renovation.  It was time to give it another shot. Back to 75% of emotional capacity, I ventured here one Friday night. I was looking for a meal deal. I opted to go for the Wild Goose's 'all-you-can-eat' Friday fish fry. (Yes, these exist at times other than Lent.)  Since the venue was remodeled, I had better remark how it now appears. I would offer that the key aspect of this was the installation of several flat screen televisions, and (although this is speculation on my part) a newer air ventilation system. he venue looks fine. There is space for you to stroll about when it is not crowded, and the average horde here tonight would not fulfill that definition. There is a pool table in the southernmost part, and one Golden Tee video game along the east wall. The beer selection here spans the spectrum. There will be any number of beer specials here, depending on the night of the week, or the month. They're not solely megabrew dreadnaughts.  The fish was very good [$6.95]. It is the size of two fingers of your hand. I wound up having six pieces (2 + 2 + 2). You get both a lemon wedge and tartar sauce for it. I preferred the tartar sauce. It also comes with a cup of cole slaw, and french fries. The cole slaw was ok. The fries were above average. They were the slim type which were boiled until soft; slightly greasy. I thought they were good enough to not need ketchup. The kicker here is that when you request more fish, you do not get any more cole slaw or french fries. The Wild Goose is a sports bar. Its renovation has elevated it to a new, higher level. On this Friday night, it was showing (somewhere in the venue) the Olympics®, auto racing, preseason gridiron, the southside b**eball team's game, and the coup d'gracé, an out-of-market b**eball game. Unlike that ghastly night at O'Malley's West, the people behind the bar know how to operate the television sets. The TVs are hooked into one of the cash registers | computer terminals. A channel can be changed without having to finesse a wireless remote control at a specific TV. So, the TVs which were given over to the out-of-market game went from Houston @ New York, to Pittsburgh @ Milwaukee, and finally to Minnesota @ Anaheim. The TV system is DirecTV®. Obviously, it has the b**eball package. I would expect it to have the college and professional gridiron packages when those begins. I was not looking for a soccer match here, but I absorb the impression that it would try to find it for you [especially if you knew what DirecTV channel it was]. Bar staff were pleasant, friendly, and cognizant. The prices were below average. (Were they the 'cheater' 14-ounce glasses? I can't honestly tell. I want to utter ""no"", but I never had a bottled beer for which to be sure.) Compound all of these ingredients, and they accumulate to a five-star rating. One which won't depend on the other clientele present as well. The Half Acre Beer [available here in bottles] people are going to construct their production brewery in the building next door at 4257. When that begins operation, I perceive that the Wild Goose shall be where they premiere their beers.  Transit options: 4265 N. is on the cusp of being close enough to walk to the _Montrose_ Brown Line ""L"" station [Five blocks, in a stairstep east - north - east route.].

When the server brings it out it's just a basket of plain fries. So we inquire about the Cajun part. She says oh it's actually just some stuff you shake on it. There's no charge for it. Then she gives us this little shaker with ""Cajun seasoning"" in it. (The coaster plummets a little bit but it was actually kind of comical due to the ditzy server who was sitting next to me) The food was really good! (Ok now I'm having a great time on this coaster. It's awesome. What could possibly go wrong??) The waitress disappears for a long length of time. This slightly annoys us. The bill comes and it's incorrect. She put the two incorrect drinks on the tab and charged us for the guacamole that my friend didn't WANT on her wrap and the cook didn't PUT on her wrap.

The wings were huge and tasted great and best of all they were ridiculously cheap.  The sign said the Mild wings won first place at the Wing Fest but I ordered hot because thats what I do.  The service wasn't too great, the bartender said to me, ""I know you're eating but can you close your tab so I can get off work, I need to drink beer too.""
