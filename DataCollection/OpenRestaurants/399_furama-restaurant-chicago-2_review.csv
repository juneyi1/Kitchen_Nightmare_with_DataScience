The egg rolls were mushy and I have no idea what they were stuffed with but it definitely wasn't vegetables. The vegetable lo mein was greasy. It came within the hour predicted but everything was cold. And everything was completely laden with salt. With hundreds of Chinese delivery options, I see no need to order from here again.

The extensive menu features traditional favorites, like pork shu mai, tender beef meatballs, shrimp fun rolls, BBQ pork buns and egg tarts. But be sure to try some of the more adventurous offerings. The shrimp and green onion steamed dumplings were a savory delight! Each dumpling looked like beautifully wrapped gifts and the green onions perfectly balanced the briny flavors of fresh shrimp. The peanut and pork dumplings also had a surprising, good flavor and great textures. Minced pork, peanuts, vegetables and chives filled each parcel. Balance the meal with a small plate of blanched greens. I chose the sweet pea tips in garlic sauce. These tender, sweet leaves and shoots were lightly seasoned with salt and soy sauce, then generously topped with fried garlic.  There are plenty of dim sum to choose from: vegetarian, beef, pork, shrimp, chicken, steamed, fried, blanched, baked, savory, sweet. With so many delicious treats on the menu and such friendly service, it is no wonder that Furama is a favorite among foodies and families.

Been to numerous dim sum places both in United States and oversea in Taiwan, I have to say this place really got nothing out of ordinary in terms of culinary achievements.  Don't get me wrong, this does not mean that this place has horrendous food. The food is good and typical of what you would expect of a Dim Sum place in Chicago area. They  match the standard of other dim sum places that Chicago has to offer, but that is simply it.  Though I do have to say, I personally enjoyed the Doh Hua (soft tofu desert) that they have to offer. Most Doh Hua in dim sum places simply rest in a syrup soup. But this place's Doh Hua actually is accompanied by ginger syrup (which is how they do things in Taiwan).

Our go-to spot used to be Sun Wah, and I admit that I like their Duck Dinner more, but Sun Wah kept getting shut down by the Health Department and we didn't want to chance it anymore. Thus, we head to Furama for a Holiday feast that includes both Duck and Dim Sum. We've tried many things on the menu and our favorites have been Shrimp Dumpling, Pork Dumpling, Beef Siu Mai, Shrimp & Meat Dumpling, Spring Roll, Barbecue Pork Bun, Roast Duck, Broccoli with Oyster Sauce, and Pepper Shrimp. Most of us are full by the end, but I'll round off the meal with Coconut Pudding or Mango Pudding (both are more like a dense gelatin).

2016-12-31,4.0,"Having moved to the Edgewater community from Maywood, and finding this bright spot was the proverbial bucket of gold. I've only had the carry out even after ordering several times, (one day I will sit for lunch). Once upon a time, I made the trek to Chinatown on 22nd and Cermak and Wentworth, for my Chinese cuisine. I must admit I am a fan of the newer restaurants away from the touristy traditional restaurants to the south of Cermak. However, now I need not travel so far because a ""newer"" Chinatown aka Vietnamese Town is right down the street. The carry-out service is always as it says, ""Ready for pick-up within ten to fifteen minutes"". Once I was coming from my school in Evanston and asked them to make adjustments, and they did. Another time, I gave myself a treat on my birthday and ordered from them, (sadly, birthdays are just another passing day - still a blessing, however, there is yet work to be done, everyday). I mentioned that it was my birthday in passing when placing my order and received a birthday greeting on my receipt - which was sweet. When ordering for my troops, (my children), when they are around, my order tends to be rather large - but I think in appreciation of my large order, there is something extra, I believe as a thank you. It's nothing huge, but an additional appetizer, not just the fortune cookies. Since, I've only discovered the extra treat when I'm back at my place, I don't go back, but I believe it really is a thank you, because I've never been minus what I've ordered. The taste of the food is very good. I order shrimp items and broccoli with oyster sauce for myself and beef and pork for the troops - they eat my shrimp goodies too. It's been an assortment from the dim sum menu and regular meals - everything is always tasty and seasoned well and still warm when I arrive home. Their containers are something to write home about - they are reusable - I love them. Just the other day Son three remarked, ""You know when you go to a restaurant too much - when you have their containers in your cabinet - everywhere"".

We got 2 XL dim sums (broccoli with oyster sauce and noodles) and 5 M dim sums (pork buns, shrimp and crab dumplings, pork and peanut dumplings, shrimp rolls, and something else I forgot the name of!). I only wish the carts came with descriptions of the items and their prices. We ended up spending a lot without even knowing it, and it was hard to communicate with the people who pushed the carts. I was completely stuffed at the end of the meal. I also enjoyed some sips of my bf's avocado shake!",0.7997,0.865,0.075,0.06,0.5641414141414142
2016-10-08,1.0,"So sad. I've been going here since I was a little kid with my family. We would come here many weekends and get a lot of food upstairs. Back then the dimsum was great and the food was good quality....and the service was MUCH BETTER and more friendly happy workers.  Last year I had a bad experience with very raw pork in my bbq pork fried rice. I ignored that and decided to go back TODAY. So today I went during lunch for dimsum. My boyfriend and I ordered 4 plates. They were super pushy on making us order more. We got an XL plate of bbq pork and it was all cold :( it was almost gross to eat. The workers were constantly hovering over us and I couldn't really enjoy eating out. I asked a server if there was egg custard pie and he said no, only bbq pork pie. I asked another server the same question and she brought out some other pie that looks nothing like egg custard. So I pointed on the menu and said this is the egg custard pie and she came back out the second time with the correct pie. It was so uncomfortable eating there with how rude the servers were today. We rushed out of there and still left a tip. After the many years of going here with the bad quality and the bad service that I received today I will never come back. It wasn't worth. Also they charge 1.80$ for tea when Asian restaurants give u hot tea for free. If the owner does nothing with the service and quality it will probably be out of business because the upstairs use to be filled with people and they no longer even use the upstairs because less people come now.",-0.9018,0.797,0.077,0.126,0.48290598290598297

The server asked if we wanted it ""hot."" I thought she meant spicy, but no, she meant ""do you want me to reheat it for you."" After responding ""...yes?,"" she came back with a reheated duck.

2016-05-16,1.0,"I normally do not write negative reviews, however, I am incredibly disappointed by my recent delivery experience.  I ordered on Fumara's website and paid for the order and del8very fee with my card. There was a field for tip, which I tried to enter,  but the field was grayed out so I figured I would add on the tip on the credit card receipt when my food was delivered.  When delivery person arrived, he pointed to the receipt and said ""you did not add a tip"". It was a little odd/rude, but I didn't over think it, and just let him know I would be happy to add it to my receipt (which one can normally do). The delivery man asked if I had cash, and I explained I did not have any on me. He set the delivery bag on the floor and called the restaurant while standing in the hallway of the condo building. He was on his mobile long enough that I just excused myself and told him to knock on my door when he was done. When he got off the phone and said that the restaurant could not change the amount to include the tip. He said I could not write it on the receipt for the restaurant to charge later. It was very strange, and very rude. It didn't end there though. He asked me again ""you really don't have cash for the tip""? The bag remained on the floor beside him in the delivery tote. I then told him ""sir, I have paid for the order and deliver fee. I do not have cash on me right now for the tip , and I am surprised I cannot enter it on the receipt. I would like to tip you, but oddly, I am not allowed to enter it on the reciept. I would like the order I paid for."" He then proceeded to call his restaurant again and said he would need to speak to the owner. At that point i insisted he take care of the issue at the restaurant. I told him that he could either leave the order which I paid for with me, or take it back to the restaurant and refund my card. He then abruptly handed me my order and yelled ""fine, take it with no tip!"". I was so upset I could not eat.  I will never recommend Fumara.

2016-03-09,4.0,"My friends and I eat here fairly often on Sundays when we're in the city. We pick this place over Phoenix or Triple Crown mostly for convenience since we tend to hang out on the north side and Chinatown is just too much of a hassle to drive to. Parking in the area is fairly easy (there is also a validated lot, but the last few times we were here the lot was either too full or completely empty and looked like it was closed) on any of the side streets or if you use public transportation it's very close to the Argyle Red Line stop.  Service is decent. There are always a few really young (high school) kids working who are kind of quiet, but they get the job done and that's what really matters I suppose. Like I mentioned, we usually do Sunday brunch here and order dim sum off the carts. We came here once after brunch hours and sat downstairs and ordered dim sum off the menu which was definitely not as good in terms of quality or service, so I would recommend coming when the upstairs is open and they have the carts being pushed around!  As far as what to order, my favorites are the har gow, siu mai, chicken feet, spare ribs, taro puffs, gai lan (the price on this one is honestly not worth it, but if you need some greens in your life it's a good choice), and egg tarts. If you're careful about what you order you can easily get a REALLY filling meal for under $20 including tip. It's not the cheapest dim sum I've had or the best quality for the price, but since we're in the Midwest I really can't complain. It's also a good place to eat with a large group since you can sample more dishes! We've eaten here with groups of 20+ before and never had an issue. However, if you want to pay on separate tabs (for any sized group), BRING CASH.  Overall, I would definitely recommend Furama for convenience.

I'm willing to sacrifice a tiny bit of food quality for that (but not much). The worst item was the pork belly - the skin sat for so long the crispy dried out to tough and leathery. So sad... Should be the best thing there. Luckily, the pork and preserved egg congee here is flavorful and mellow at the same time, just the way it should be. Delicious.  Everything else I've ordered here (dumpling varieties, chicken feet, shrimp crystal dumplings, buns, basically everything worth getting) is pretty decent, though I imagine they're hard to mess up... I also do think there's a bit more variety here. Nothing creative but more versions of dumplings or ho fun fillings or sesame balls, etc. Would come again for sure, esp cuz they have their own parking lot next door so I can drive the 4 El stops worth here and walk 20 feet instead of 1000 to get to my food.

But there has to be a reason for the restaurant to have carts -- usually it's because they have a lot of customers who want dim sum, so the carts are used to bring food quickly to everyone and the food is generally fresh and replenished often. Unfortunately, I think Furama is using the carts for the gimmick of giving costumers immediate gratification, but they don't have enough customers who eat there. Because of this, the dim sum dishes are often cold and have been sitting out for awhile, so that they're no longer appetizing. We had a big group there for a weekend brunch, and when we were seated, all the carts that were idle before immediately huddled to us. We tried a bunch of the standard dim sum items, and I've definitely had better elsewhere I think they should work on their strategy, since I'm sure that their food would bette rif it was fresh. Maybe for a restaurant like Furama, a made-to-order dim-sum model is better.",0.9696,0.816,0.158,0.026,0.5188271604938272

I can understand an item or two being misplaced but calling the customer back and calling them a liar is downright wrong. I have never ever experienced such rudeness from a restaurant ever.

I try my best to keep an open mind and manage said expectations but certain things can't be ignored (on both sides). What NOT to get here, char siu bao, chicken feet, or spare ribs. Blurg!!! The chicken feet were overcooked and obviously artificially dyed red. This same dye was used on the bbq'd pork of the char siu and to add insult to injury the dough of the bao was blah. Finally, the spare ribs weren't great, not even good, just okay but I prob won't get them again. Now what was good was anything steamed and made with shrimp, the rice, and a number of the fried dumplings. This portion of the menu is what saved Fruma from getting a 2 star rating. This and their service was exceptionally well executed.

We also ordered pork pan fried lo mien and that was great as well. They have a side menu of noodle dishes and I think Vietnamese dishes too.

The fiancee and I realized it had been over six months since we'd had our last dim sum fix, so we bowed to the inevitable and grabbed our menus.  Now here's the thing. I've been to Furama before and I like the dim sum.  I recommend going in the morning on a weekend. That's where you get the classic dim sum experience of sitting in a huge room on the upper level with tons of other people and the circling dim sum carts. If you are lucky, you can get a spot in their (rather tiny) parking lot and park for free. However, the magic of Furama is that they have Dim Sum till 8pm every day! So if you get the urge for little dumplings filled with pork/shrimp/veggies on the way home from work, you can hop off the Red Line and go get some. The prices are reasonable and the quality is good. The service is not spectacular, but it wasn't bad either. When you go at a non-standard time, you sit in the lower level restaurant and they bring you a menu to order what you like.

I don't remember the name of this dish but it was a sweet fried dough wrapped in a noodle covered in a sweet soy sauce. It had an odd texture but the perfect balance of sweet and salty. I did find the roasted duck to be a little on the bland side and it was also tough and boney and very difficult to eat. If you're a fan of Asian desserts you'll love they're custard buns.

The dim sum selection is fantastic, including classic favorites and things I haven't even seen before.  The waitresses come around with dim sum carts frequently, which is nice.  The food was authentic and tasty.  The tea was yummy and hot.  The service was very quick and friendly.  They brought all the sauces we could have wanted to the table instantly, with individual dipping bowls for each of us.  We didn't have to ask for anything once - I guess the wait staff is comprised of magic genies! Why only three stars?  Because some of the food was too cooled off to be enjoyable.  Think, cold barbecue buns, cold sponge cake.... =/  Some things need to be hot, and the temperatures were all over the place.  The dishes that were hot were great!  No complaints on that front.  The rest of the food though had clearly been wheeled around for a while.  If they aren't going to make the dim sum made to order, then maybe there needs to be a warming system... like... ""okay, Cart 8, you've done five laps, come back to the kitchen and warm those up.""  I dunno.  I would not choose to go here independently, but if friends wanted to go in the future, I would not have a problem with it.  If they found a way to nail down the temperature and have the food piping hot at your table, I'd bump this up to a 4 or even 5 star review.   Bottom line: The service is wonderful, the authentic food tastes good, but the temperature of the food is hit or miss, which can detract from the enjoyment of the meal.",0.9868,0.841,0.138,0.022,0.631045751633987

2013-06-09,3.0,"A brief summary: 1. As good as Chinatown Dim Sum places. I can't vouch for their chinese food, but things looked pretty standard at standard prices. For $30, our party of 2 people had plenty of Dim Sum with plenty left over. 2. The service is mediocre at best. This being a BYOB place, I think that most of the servers are used to not coming around much. So this ones a draw - you can bring your own drinks (a kid next to us had a huge plastic cup of orange juice...or a screwdriver, whichever).  3. The decor is pretty classically overdone Chinese American. I felt that the tables were sticky with soy sauce and things just seemed a little less sanitary than I would have preferred. Because of this and the service, I'll probably only order take out. 4. Furama has a parking lot - but don't expect to get in it. It's super small and super cramped and parking spaces are all measured for compact cars. They even park cars vertically as to make the aisles smaller. Expect to pay for parking or drive around the residential hoping to find a spot. Access to the red lines and bus make this place convienient to get to. 5. I love that they have cart service, but I would only go to order off the menu. The carts aren't equipped for continuous steam, so some pans get to you cold. I can't really complain.

Me: *looks on Yelp* We could go a traditional brunch place, OR we can get dim sum for brunch! I've never had dim sum for brunch. Heck, I haven't had dim sum in Chicago since I moved here back in 2008. Thus, I was pretty stoked for Furama. Their website listed at least five vegetarian dim sum dishes. That's enough for me. David had the entire menu to choose from.  We walked up to the second floor where the restaurant was. It is very big and very open. We went around 10:00am, and it got extremely busy around 11am. Fear not, there are *a lot* of tables. I don't think you have to worry about a wait. Anyway, our waiter was an older Chinese man. He was a bit slow, but so friendly. In fact, everyone in the restaurant was. I enjoyed watching the adorable teenagers work the dim carts alongside their older employees.  When the first cart came around and I asked if there were any vegetarian dim sum, a woman went out and grabbed me two dishes from either kitchen or another cart! They were the dried vegetarian bean curd (mock duck) and vegetarian bean curd roll. We had an order of Chinese broccoli. It was quite delicious, but I found out that it had oyster sauce on it. I got an order of vegetarian fun roll from a cart, but the server accidentally gave me the barbeque pork fun roll. Whoops. My boyfriend got himself pork shumai and shrimp dumplings. Just when I thought I was done, the woman came back and brought me fried vegetarian dumplings. They were good, although I wish it came with dumpling sauce. For dessert, I had sesame balls and David had a sweet red bean soup, which he really liked.  The price for nine dishes with tax was about $33. I would give Furama 4.5 stars (due to service hiccups), but David would give it 5. It is the best dim sum restaurant he has been to in Chicago.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating to vegetarians. There is a decent selection of vegetarian dim sum (probably the most in Chicago). The food is quite good.

The decor and restaurant itself are a little antiquated but not displeasing. About the only thing that was a complete nightmare was getting out of their parking lot.

Don't go to the downstairs restaurant. Go to the huge, barnlike, authentically Chinese, kinda sleazy, UPSTAIRS. Go on the weekend for brunch. That is where the Furama experience that people rave about happens. For my money, Furama is the most reliable, most authentic dim sum in Chicago. I have eaten dim sum in Shang Hai, Guang Zho, Singapore, Bangkok, and both New York and San Francisco's Chinatowns, so I know at least a little about what I'm speaking about here.  The noise, the push carts, the eternally refilled pots of jasmine or oolong tea, the lazy susans, the barely controlled chaos, and the many, many varieties of food are what a dim sum brunch is all about. That, and the conversation and cameraderie that all those things promote when you bring at least three friends.  Don't take too many things too fast. There will be more choices coming. If you want something in particular and haven't seen it after six or eight carts come by, ask a server--they will almost always make it up fresh for you in the kitchen.  Yes, the ceiling tiles are plastic, Yes, the cleanliness factor is not the absolute highest. Yes, the quality is sometimes a little uneven. None of that matters in the long run.

Furama subscribes to the carts rotating around the room and that sort of window shopping approach worked just fine for us. Plate after plate of amazing cuisine was passed before our hungry eyes. Shrimp with tofu, bbq pork bao, lotus leaf-wrapped rice, coconut pudding bao and siu mai of all sorts are only some of the outstanding bites placed between our grinning teeth.

Onto the good stuff.  This is one of the few places I have been to that still has carts which they push around so you can see what type of delicious food you want before you eat it.   For whatever reason my friend and sister went overboard with the shrimp dumplings and shu mai (pork dumplings).  The best thing there was a shrimp wrapped roll in tofu skin which sounds weird but was very delicious.  One of the managers seemed kind of pissy as we were still asking for carts to checkout dishes but apparently we were not ordering enough so this review is more of a 4 for food and a 3 for service.  The only after effect will be that you will get very thirsty a few hours after you leave because there is a lot of msg.,0.874,0.838,0.099,0.063,0.4953333333333334

We walk in and the restaurant portion is partially filled. Furama most host events on the second floor because throughout the night hoards of people vanished upstairs. What they lacked in regular patrons they certainly made up for in party people. The food options were huge. There was a separate menu for main plates then another menu for dim sum. I must mention I love the fact dim sum is available all day here. My mom and I browsed for a bit and we decided on the vegetable chow mein, the black mushroom with broccoli and tofu, and since my mom wanted dim sum, the pickled cucumber salad and the vegetarian fun roll. The dim sum items were great. The pickled cucumber salad was sweet and with a hint of vinegar. The vegetarian fun roll while tasty was messy to eat. Don't mind getting messing myself. The black mushroom and broccoli with tofu was tender and light. My favorite by far was the vegetable chow mein. It was greasy, the noodles softened just right, and flavorful.

2011-04-18,1.0,"Below are my comments for the wedding event on Apr. 16, 2011 at Furama. Food Quality/Service:  3 out of 5 since it was average which I was quite surprise since many had forewarned me that this is the best out of the worst.  - Service:  There were long delay in delivery after the 3rd course meal (out of 11). We then ask the waitress and they said ours will come later because there was another bigger party right next door that take priority over ours. Price:  3.5 out of 5 since I thought it was reasonable and the food portion was good.  Interior decor of banquet facility:  Need remodeling. Suggested minimal changes are the chairs and floor to make this place look modern and cleaner. Currently it look busy since it is so colorful, outdated and not as clean. Overall Service:  1 out of 5. I would give it a negative if there were such thing. It was HORRIFIC!!! Below is the detail of our ordeal (not just my own but many other guests that had to endure it throughout the night). Many of these requests had been asked by the family in advance/prior to the date of event but yet they had not fulfilled. 1)  Ask waitress for water to make coffee for guests and they specifically said we will not provide it until reception start. 2)  Beer was not cold even though we had dropped off all cases a day before and ask the restaurant to put it into their cold room. They had promised to do so but yet had not fulfilled.  3)  Ask waitress for forks for 9 out of 10 guests that didn't have it. The waitress give me this unpleasant look and pointed out that there are already forks on the table. I then responded to her that we only have 1 out of 10. She then came back with plastic forks and threw it on the table and didn't say a word. The forks still have rubber band around it. I cannot recall any banquet facility that serve their guests with plastic forks except for this one. 4)  Approximately 10:30 pm, we request to have the leftover food to go since there were a lot left. The waitress specifically said that ""You do it. I don't have time."" 5)  Approximately 11 pm, waitress start pulling table linen off guests table while guests are still sitting at the table. While pulling it off, they even spill water all over the table and didn't even bother to clean it up. 6)  Approximately 11:10 pm, the chair covers being pulled while guests are still sitting on it. The chair covers were not free, we paid as part of the wedding package. Usually, other vendors start collecting them after the event is over which was not in this case. RIDICULOUS!      CONCLUSION:  Honestly I don't think it is all the waitress fault in providing bad service as a whole since I feel it is more the management responsibility. Management seems to have stretched their service thin that night. There were only few service people going back and forth serving 2 different parties simultaneously which consists of hundreds of people. Overall, they need new management and major improvement in their service. Unfortunately there aren't major competition against this restaurant which I wish they do so that they might learn from it, especially when they realized their profits had dropped dramatically.",-0.9237,0.868,0.057,0.076,0.5357940305308727

So glad we didn't over-order like we usually do. Plus, they gave us a Vietnamese menu to go along with their regular menus. Like, why wouldn't we go across the street if we wanted Vietnamese?

The only complaint about this place is I wished the place could be cleaner, especially the washrooms.  I always try to avoid the washroom if I can, but mostly cannot avoid it as I have to pee before my one hour commute home.  Avoid it like a plague if you can; they are sometimes out of toilet paper and always out of hand soap, Yuck !!!  Also, because of the rush of people on a Sunday, it is always hard to flag down your waiter; I suggest you place all your drink order, water, soda and extra napkins when you are first seated, cause that is the only time you will see your waitress and after when you are presented with the bill.

Everything was delicious and the three others I've brought this time around thoroughly enjoyed their food. Excellent service and we left very please. 3. Returned with two others in utter disappointment. This time we ordered a little dim sum and some entrees. Our waitress was terrible. First she seats us at a table where the floor was disgustingly sticky (clearly somebody spilled something right before us and it wasn't cleaned up). Then she couldn't get any of our orders right and she brought out the food like 5-10 minutes apart per order. I was embarrassed for her.

The shrimp dumpling and rice crepe had thick skin. The steam bun and egg tart were not bad. The rest was just OK or below average.

I chose coconut with tapioca (boring but so yummy!!!) but you can go with green bean if you are so inclined (!) or better yet, soursop. Described by - who else?!?! - Wikipedia as 'a combination of strawberry and pineapple with sour citrus flavor notes contrasting with an underlying creamy flavor reminiscent of coconut or banana' (really - coul NEVER have said any better) it's refreshing, not too sweet, exotic and it shows that you know your sh$t.

I wish more of my friends and or relatives would have functions here, it is that good! Also, get the bubble tea before you leave and enjoy the tapioca goodness!

2010-03-09,4.0,Went to Furama last weekend with friends for my first try at Dim Sum. I must say i was pleasantly surprised with the food here. Atmosphere was very nice and had typical chinese restaurant decor. The staff was very friendly and did a great job handling our large group of 15 people. And ok I admit it those Asian boys look really hot in those little sports jerseys :)   Service was fast sense all the food was already ready. Was amazing how many different selections they had on those carts. Cost wasn't bad at all considering how much food we got. Be sure not to skip the sesame balls and mango dessert :) Looking forward to going back again.,0.9888,0.718,0.282,0.0,0.5533650793650793

When we sat down, I instantly felt a little overwhelmed by all of the options and felt very concerned I would miss the best dishes.  As I think is the case with most dim sum restaurants, all of the dishes are rolled around on large carts.  Luckily, our friends are dim sum pros and knew all of the right things to grab from the carts.  However, the staff did stop to explain a few dishes to me, which I really appreciated.   I also like their efficiency.  We never ran out of food or the option to snag more.   I wish I could remember the names of what we ate because it was ALL delicious!

While I've had items from the Dim Sum genre in the past, this was my first encounter with the rolling carts.  The Dim Sum was quite good; there were hits and misses. The pork shumai, little baby spare ribs, shrimp toast, baby bok choy, sesame balls, custard rolls, mango pudding, red bean pudding and assorted other pot stickers were lovely. I did try the chicken feet - basically limps chicken skin with BBQ sauce; edible, but I'll pass next time. The poached chicken wasn't worth it either.  The service was lacking, probably because they aren't used to having so many people, what with the Lunar New Year parade having just ended and a wedding upstairs. But, how hard is it to get chopsticks and soy sauce. Several of us asked every staff members that passed by for cups, chopsticks and soy sauce. Cups and chopsticks materialized, but no soy sauce. I went to the next table and they graciously turned over their bottle to our table of 13.  I never saw a menu, so I can't comment on the prices, but we ordered a boatload of food and with tax and tip it came out to $21.00 a person (and we left a generous tip because it was easier to round up.)  The ambiance is lackluster, but parking is free for diners - a good thing for the busy area.  Thanks Yelpers for introducing me to Chinese tapas.",0.9797,0.862,0.111,0.027,0.38360071301247767

I found it (finally!) at Furama. Before settling in to gorge at the trough, I had to navigate my way through the low budget Chinese New Year celebration in Uptown. Seriously, people: leave the parade to Chinatown. That pitiful looking dragon and Black Cat 'fireworks' just makes me sad to see. Freshly chastened from our SW experience, we knew not to order from the menu. Instead, we attacked the roving band of hapless tweens (have I mentioned that I LOVE child labor?) pushing carts through the restaurant like some hapless descendants from the house of Sisyphus. Barking orders worked much better in filling our bellies and getting good selection that ordering ever did. Note to self: do this again. Even though there were some service miscues (does anyone really go for dim sum for the amazing service? No.), the food made me forget all that noise. Of the numerous plates I devoured, my favorites were the pork shumai, shrimp dumplings, shrimp/chive cakes, pork/shrimp/peanut deliciousness, pork bun/bao, mango pudding thing, bbq pork, some more pork, salt & pepper squid (or was it shrimp?), a pinch more shrimp, never-ending green tea, chili paste on EVERYTHING and the star of the show: custard rolls. The very name made me a little queasy, but I have learned that if Yanyao says ""Eat it!"", you eat it. And, you will love it. I could have taken down plates of those rolls all by myself.

Or I should have just took out a lighter and lit up two 20's because I really hated myself for dropping money on food I could not eat and did not enjoy. You see, I can be a cheap bitch so I HATE it when I waste or throw away my money on stupid shit. My brother was in town and we were both in the mood for asian flavors so we thought we'd give this a try for dinner. Bad idea, because it sucked hardcore. By the way- their takeout menus are totally misleading because it lists half order options and pricing. They don't do that, we asked. So yes the portions are generous and it was just too much shitty food to deal with. We ordered the egg foo young and chow mein with beef and chinese broccoli. The egg foo young I didn't taste because I hate bean sprouts but my brother said it was okay. I tasted the sauce it was really bland. I was going to spoon it over on my noodles because the chow mein was pretty dry, needing more sauce pretty badly, it was underseasoned and just tasted of sesame oil. I only had two bites. They don't leave out condiments like soy sauce or siracha sauce on their tables- which their food needed badly. Thank GOD we ordered 3 little plates of dim sum cuz we were starving. Waaaaaaaah, woe is me.  No wonder this place is nearly empty on a friday night. I cringe thinking back to our meal there.  So the lesson here is only come here for dim sum if you have to, but skip the rest of the food. If a chinese restaurant can't make a kick ass version of chow mein noodles then it's just a bad sign. I felt bad for all that food being uneaten so I packed it up and drove back to the south loop and dropped it off for a homeless person.

Sorry to all my Yelpers who I let down by coming in at 1:35pm :( While I knew there was a parade going on, I didn't expect there to be a private event or wedding upstairs!! The private party really threw a monkey wrench into the plans since staff was likely diverted to the upstairs and room was severely limited. Then of course trying to load up that many people downstairs led to disorganization and having to squeeze people in tightly which worked out well despite the slow service. Furama's staff was not on top of things for New Year's as the staff left us with too few chopsticks, cups, chairs, and other details. I think I asked for soy sauce three times before Alice S's friend got up and grabbed some herself! Props to the other table for holding down the fort while I arrived late, I am glad someone over there knew what to order!!! Towards the end, the amateur servers left the scene and the best server came through delivering everything in quick order and coming back for more.

Lots of tofu, shrimp and dumplings but all lacked in flavor. The next time I tried Furama was their takeout. I went for the Braised Duck with seafood. Now I know what you're thinking, 'how the Hell can you screw up such a beautiful combination like duck AND seafood?' But they did. Duck, being a very fatty and flavorful bird is pretty damn hard to mess up but Furama managed to do a damn good job doing so. I've never tasted such a bland & boring duck! Topped with flavorless seafood parts and even more flavorless Chinese vegetables. What a downer. Egg rolls bland and over fried, crab Rangoon salty and down right yucky. Perhaps I'm just not a fan of Cantonese food as it lacks the fire of Szechuan which I happen to LOVE.

2009-09-18,4.0,"The one-line review: solid dim-sum on the north side of Chicago. Furama is located just a block away from the Argyle red line stop, which makes it just a short hop from Evanston as compared to Chinatown. That in and of itself wins huge bonus points from me - going to Chinatown requires planning and commitment, while popping down to the Argyle stop can be a spur of the moment decision. The food at Furama is decent - all the standard dim sum dishes (char siu bao, har gao, shiu mai, etc.) are represented here and they do a reasonably good job with them. Have I had better quality dim sum at other places? Sure. But Furama gets the job done. Selection off the carts is wider on Sunday - presumably because they expect a higher quantity of customers - but you can always order off the menu. Speaking of which, they have a nice picture menu for those who are unfamiliar with dim sum. Both times we went, the number of customers was what I would consider somewhat low, which may part of the issue when it comes to quality - low customers equals slower turnover of food on the carts. We've been here a couple of times - the first time on a Saturday early afternoon, and the second around 11:30 AM on a Sunday. On the Saturday trip we were seated in the small first floor dining area and the selection on the carts consisted of mostly the standards. It was a little cramped, leading to traffic jams, which in all honesty, is the more authentic feel for a dim sum joint. On the Sunday trip, the first floor dining area was closed off and we went up to the second floor where they have an expansive hall with lots of tables. Traffic flow was better and the carts carried more variety of items. The carts are generally pushed by teenagers - the schtick is that they're all wearing Furama athletic jerseys. The teens *are* disinterested, but they all speak great English, so this is very helpful for any newbies you may be dragging along. There are also black-vested waiters ready to fill your water glasses, refill your teapot, bring you the check, or any items you haven't seen on the carts. All in all, pretty good service. Here are some general strategies for dim sum at any eatery in the US: 1. Avoid the crowd. Know when the peak hour is for the rush, and try to be there at least a half-hour earlier. In general, Sunday around noon is the absolute worst time to go - church just got out and everyone is headed for the restaurant. 2. Try to get a table near a major traffic artery - intersections of aisles are good. Even better, try to get the table closest to the kitchen. That guarantees you a shot at the really popular items. Avoid at all costs tables in the far corners of the room. 3. Put the experienced dim sum eaters and Chinese speakers (and/or the culinarily adventurous) on the aisle. It can be intimidating for newbies to be confronted by the cart pushers (who often don't speak much English - not the case at Furama, but other establishments) with unfamiliar foods. 4. Pace yourself (unless you know what you're doing). It's really easy to let your eyes/stomach do the talking and fill your table with stuff. Unless it's super crazy busy, you're probably OK letting a few carts pass you by.",0.993,0.835,0.118,0.047,0.48173400673400674

2009-08-30,3.0,"I went to Furama with my boyfriend at about 8:00 PM on a Sunday, so I'm guessing that's why my experience was a bit different than other reviews. I've never had dim sum, and I was so excited to try it and see food brought to me, but when we sat down, we were given menus with regular and pricey Chinese food on it. I KNEW there must be dim sum thanks to Yelp, when the waitress finally came over to us, we asked about dim sum, and she brought over a menu with pictures. There were no prices so we were a little worried, but ordered 5 tasty looking dim sum along with a fried rice and a bubble tea. The dim sum were brought out as they were ready, which was nice because we were very hungry and they seemed to be taking awhile. This is why the place gets 3 stars: it all tasted awesome. The sesame balls were the best I've ever had, they were crispy and hot and awesome. The different baos all had yummy and sort strange things in them, so you probably can't go wrong with the buns. After we finished all five dishes, they brought us our bills, sans the fried rice and bubble tea. I was pretty upset because I was very excited about my Mango/Coconut bubble tea, but we had been in there so long that we just paid and left. But I must say, for (free) hot tea and 5 awesome dim sum dishes, it only cost $16 and that was quite enough for the two of us.

2009-08-25,3.0,"Background on dim sum (since I was unaware, maybe you are too?):  Wikipedia: Dim sum (literally meaning ""a bit of heart"") is the name for a Chinese cuisine which involves a wide range of light dishes served alongside Chinese tea. Yum cha (literally ""drinking tea"") is the term used to describe the entire dining experience, especially in contemporary Cantonese. It is usually served in the mornings until noon time at Chinese restaurants and at specialty dim sum eateries where typical dishes are available throughout the day. Dishes come in small portions and may include meat, seafood, and vegetables, as well as desserts and fruit. The items are usually served in a small steamer basket or on a small plate So, in a more literal translation of my experience...I shall dissect the term, for my own uses.  Dim: dim  (dm) adj. dimmer, dimmest -Lacking in brightness: a dim room. -Lacking luster; dull and subdued. -Obscure to the mind or the senses. -Lacking keenness or vigor. Sum: sum  (sm) n. -An amount obtained as a result of adding numbers. (dishes) -The whole amount, quantity, or number; an aggregate. (foooood!) -The central idea or point; the gist. (gluttony!) Conclusion?  I found the dishes/experience to be a little ""lackluster"" as a ""whole."" Get it? Get it? Sure you do, c'mon ;) I'm trying here.  Yes, yes. I'm a bit on the fence about this...but I'm also VERY much a dim summing novice. (yes, I also realize that is not to be used as a verb, deal!)...I will certainly try again.  Service was fine, but I am sure its something you must grow accustomed to...ordering things off carts and flagging people down. The busboys were prompt, waters were refilled often. The selection is better the earlier you go (we were there around 2pm on a Sunday, and it was somewhat slim pickins).  Highlight: Bubble tea selection is sexy, sexy. All fresh fruits, with fresh tapioca balls (the market is across the street!). Had I been looking to indulge, an avocado variety with extra tapioca would've sent my bliss level into overdrive, and perhaps clouded my rather average dim sum experience into a 4-star range. Who knows? I may just have to trek back to figure it out... Oh, and I ate some jelly fish. Kind of like slimy, yet crunchy noodles. Not sure how I feel about it, but I didn't die, so hey...yay jellyfish tentacles! Easy access of Argyle Red, 36 Broadway bus, or there is parking in the lot directly south. Warning though, weekends it is mostly full because they share it with the market directly across the street, which is generally jammed.  I'll try again. I dig the culture, the community, the process of it...and I think I just need to make myself more aware of what I am eating and take more initiative in figuring out what I will like.

2009-08-25,2.0,"Dim sum not for everyone but for some. This place was my first dim sum experience.  As my first experience it was neato and I relished in the fact that the food came to ME on little carts pushed by obviously bored teenagers. My first experience was incredible!  It was my first afterall.  Since that visit I have been back to this location numerous times as well as to many other Chicago dim sum locales.  My observation: good for beginners and only mediocre for novices. Although the food comes to you on carts (pretty nifty if you've never experienced this before) it is often luke warm at best and lacks that certain luster freshly prepared food should have.  It looks like it has been sitting around for a while and quite possibly might have been.  The food taste is good; sometimes great and sometimes poor but mostly right in the middle.  Most of the dumplings are sticky and room tempurature and the fried goodies are missing their deep fried warmth that makes them so attractive. Don't be intimidated by the sometimes hectic cart experience!  You might not know what stuff is but the staff will answer your questions and won't be offended if you just point at something and say ""that."" If you don't feel like trekking to China town and you really want dim sum, by all means don't pass up Furama; however, if you are a dim sum pro (like members of the Chicago Naked Dim Sum Society; WOOT!) then you won't mind driving the extra distance to the much better dim sum found in China town and the South side in general.

You see, within 30 minutes the three of us managed to tackle 13 different dim sum dishes and smoothies, all to the sweet tune of around $16 a person, all without knowing what the hell had just happened to us.   We were subjected to a blitzkrieg of dim sum.  Before we knew what hit us, another wave of tantalizing delights arrived that we simply could not say no to.  Unfortunately, as we were left without a menu I cannot provide specific names for what we had (although the servers were able to clearly describe each dish well enough for us to choose), but let it be known: it was all mindbogglingly good.    And let's just say if they ever offer you some sort of doughy, dessert roll, for the love of god take it.  Not only does it taste incredible, its texture is so amazing that you'll want to have a mattress made out of attempted: Watch out!  Tasty dim sum dessert rolls are gunning for your business!

Now matter what the explanation, I did it again yesterday. Now I'm no dim sum virgin, mind.  No, I had it once before.  But enter Furama.  This restaurant is the eqivalent of that second level Spanish class.  You walk in the door (and take the elevator to the second floor dining room, fittingly) and expect maybe a little refresher in the basics.  Maybe even to be explained to what dim sum is (much like the reader may have expected with this review - it's the Chinese version of tapas).  Doesn't happen.  The eater is instead dropped into people having full dim sum conversations where the beginner picks out small pieces.  A ""pork"" here, a ""curd"" there. A stream of fast moving carts come by your table pushed by servers who seem to be training to beat Usain Bolt in 2012.  Some momentarily stop and ask if you want anything off their cart.  Others just sprint on by and need to be flagged down. The patron chooses what looks appetizing - including some mystery meats inside dumplings - and it's set down on a lazy Susan (the most ironic thing to have in a place like this) to eat family style. Now I have to say that as a vegetarian, I ended up eating chow mein noodles, some soy based rings, and the deserts (pescetarians can delight in the amount of shrimp they have on the menu).  But everything that I did put in my mouth was incredible.  Full of flavors and textures that blew away any Chinese I had before (especially that other dim sum place).  And filling.  There is a consistency to the dim sum here that does not leave you hungry again in a couple hours.  All the meat eaters seemed to have similarly fulfilling experiences.  And we ate enough to feed a small village for about $12 per person. Now, they do let you order off a menu with photos, if you want a little more basic experience.  Though if you order off the menu, waits are a bit longer (and you look like a beginner in front of everyone).  And, shockingly, considering how fast everything else is in this place, our bubble teas (also delicious) took over half the meal to be served.  Or maybe it just seemed that way in comparison. Just one last warning.  There is no silverware on the table, only chopsticks.  Speaking of which, there was this one time I ended up throwing sushi at a dining companion due to lack of experience with those and Japanese food.  No, that's another story for another review.",0.7145,0.902,0.055,0.043,0.432888888888889

2009-06-25,2.0,"I came here with my good friend Priya S. in tow, in order to celebrate some of my recent successes, and, well, also to ensure that both of us ate a regular meal that day.  We both are the type of people that can get a bit caught up in this and that and can sometimes forget to do that all-important of activities--feeding time. Rolled up to Furama looking for some dim sum.  Now, of course, we knew that it wouldn't be like those awesome, keep-it-coming, cart-based endeavors like those famed restaurants of the ancient gilded Chinatowns of south side Chicago, or, heaven forbid, that beacon of the (very near) east, NYC.  So it was with lowered expectations and empty bellies that we descended into Furama. We were greeted with a friendly smile and a pot of hot tea.  We asked what the deal was with respect to the dim sum action, and were promptly informed that we ""check off on the sheet"" and were handed a pen.  Said sheet is a small poster inset like those you'd find in that dyingest of dying breeds, your local newspaper.  Teeny-tiny thumbnails of your dim sum options rest patiently on fields of pastel colors, juxtaposed with plain, sometimes underinformative names, as well as numbers, ranging from 101 to about 191.  Gotta catch 'em all. We opted for a selection of treats, hitting the vegetable fun roll, those sesame buns with the sticky paste in them, spring rolls, shrimp roll, spinach and shrimp roll, curry baby squid, pork dumplings, and steamed pork buns. Okay, writing it out just now made me realize precisely how much food we had ordered.  Alright, I admit it, okay?  It was probably way too much food.  But it was... decent.  Priya's favorite was the vegetable fun roll; I really liked the pork dumpling and the shrimp roll.  There's just something about eating meat that's been chopped up and reconstituted with little bits of vegetables that makes it appetizing.  But I don't want to think too hard about what it is.   Dishes came out in sort of a... ""whenever it's ready"" kind of order... which meant that we started with the spring rolls--which were almost too hot to eat--and the sesame buns (which, in my albeit limited dim sum experience, TASTES LIKE a dessertish selection... and thus I question its early presence in the meal.  Experts quibble at will).  Then most of the meaty stuff came together... followed shortly by the curry squid.  The spinach and shrimp buns didn't arrive until long after I had resigned myself to culinary defeat -- I had consumed too much.  So I didn't even get to try one.  Priya liked them, though, so, you know, that's one endorsement.  She also ordered a watermelon bubble tea that was totally OFF. THE. HOOK.  I personally HATE real-watermelon flavored thingies (hook up the jolly rancher syrup any day), but this was really delicious and refreshing. Oh, also, this is a minor sticking point.  I ordered hot and sour soup, and it totally didn't come.  Ever.  I mean, I would have managed to eat even less if I had had that, but, I mean.  Come on. SO let's hit 'em with the recap: AMBIENCE:  Meh.  Not the real dim sum experience (at the time we went anyway, which was 6 PM on a Wednesday).  Maybe the Sunday deal is a bit more exciting. FOOD:  Meh.  The dishes were hit and miss, and everything was super hot (most likely because they brought things as they were ready).  Obviously hot food is preferable to warm or cold, but I want to be able to ENJOY the spring roll, not force it down my gullet because it's too hot to actually chew leisurely. SERVICE:  Another meh.  We were fortunately content to languish over the meal, and in fact were killing some time at the end, but if you're going the dim sum route my advice would be to factor in some time. OVERALL: 3 Meh's Now, I'm willing to give this place another shot--I'd like to try their main Chinese food ish dishes and I'd give the Sunday cart-capable dim sum a chance at impressing me.  However, the next time I get a hankering for Argyle eats, I'll likely head elsewhere.",0.9915,0.841,0.108,0.051,0.5257796405873331

2009-01-27,1.0,"The restaurant is located in a Vietnamese community in Uptown Chicago, where Vietnamese restaurants and groceries are plentiful. I still had reservation after reading the positive reviews on this restaurant but I decided to give it a shot last weekend. And my gut feeling was right. I'm sorry for those who claim themselves knowing what good dimsum is like but never had good dimsum. Even if you've been to Hong Kong doesn't mean you know what good dimsum is. I was born in HK and I've had the goods and bads. Fortunately the worst were still much better than Furama's. Basic stuff... dimsum is supposed to be served steamy hot. You should see steam coming out from the carts when being pushed around. Not in this restaurant. They're lukewarm at best when served at table. Good cheung-fun, is supposed to have fresh prawns, thickness of the rice-wrap is supposed to be just right, preferrably on the thin side. It should be soft and doesn't feel heavy on starch. Anything more means the chef who made it is lack the skills. Siumai...a good mix of shrimp and pork. Nicer restaurants would put some crab roe on it. It's never supposed to be just a big chunk of pork. Veggie bean-curd roll... it's not supposed to be oily and dark brown.  Har-gow. Like Cheung-fun, the skin's supposed to be thin and not mushy. Fresh prawns. The list can go on and on. In summary, poor chef skills and no fresh ingredient, with a Vietnamese twist in the offering and style. It failed to deliver anything decent, and it's one of the worst dimsum experience I've had for a while. The price about par with others in Greater Chicago area and it's not justified due to the poor quality. When other reviewers saying ""you never have to wait"", that's a BIG WARNING SIGN!!!! Yup, it means people who know good food DON'T like it, and they'd rather go somewhere else!  For those of you who give this restaurant 3+ stars, please drive a little further to Chinatown because anyone of those is better than this one. If you're in N/NW suburb, Wok'n'roll is better than this one, even though I only gave it three stars (more like 2.5).

2009-01-19,4.0,"I like Furama.  It brings back childhood memories. Quick backstory: I grew up in Cincinnati.  I had an eye condition that necessitated frequent trips to the eye doctor.  The eye doctor was (and still is) frightening to me.  The only way my parents could get me to go (relatively) quietly was to bribe me with the promise of a trip to the Magic Wok restaurant.  The MW was a wondrous place full of fanciful Chinese tchotch - red-eyed dragons that breathed smoke, gold gilt foo dogs, ornate hanging lanterns, mystical birds, a glut of silk flowers and bamboo.  The promise of these wondrous things and a bowl of hot-sour soup and an umbrella-laden Shirley Temple was all that could stifle my eye doctor terror.  My blurry, dilated eyes would strain to capture the misty grandeur. Furama takes me back to that place.  The décor is grand, synthetic, stereotypical Chinese tack and I LOVE it! The food is fairly standard, old-school Chinese fare.  Ask for the actual Chinese menu. It is there that you will find the greatest delights.  I recommend anything with oysters.  They are succulent and as big as your fist - heavenly!   Service is average.  It's efficient, but not overly friendly (nor is it snarky).  It's standard. I am embarrassed to admit that I have never tried the dim sum (and I DO enjoy a good dim sum).  I have heard good things about it, but my sense of nostalgia over-rides the temptation to join the dim sum party.

All the ingredients were there, but I specifically ordered it spicy and it ended up tasting like kung pao chicken with 4-5 tbsp of sweet sauce in it.. it was a weird sweet spice taste. Overall a good value.. someone please let me know if they have a similar experience with a kung pao dish.",0.9848,0.764,0.212,0.023,0.6636675824175824

2007-04-10,4.0,"it's a very large restaurant that does weddings on weekends and dim sum on mornings. we usually go during the week for dim sum (weekends are just crazy and a little unorganized) the food is pretty decent varity of dim sum appetizer-sized plates.  they push carts around the room with the delicious little plates of wonders.  sometimes you may here something that's not so appetizing (chicken feet or tripe) don't worry, i don't eat those either.  and make sure you don't TOUCH the carts yourself, you may get smacked :). eat til you're about to blow up and the bill for 2 ppl will still be under 30 bucks.  i always like the chrysynthamum tea (if you want a change from the jasmine tea that is always served in chinese restaurants).  the food is pretty fresh in my opinion... just don't come FIRST thing in the morning when your chances of getting dim sum from yesterday are greatest. they have a small parking lot that is free with validation.  like most chinese restaurants, beware with the language barrier, but overall the servers are very nice :)",0.9718,0.828,0.157,0.015,0.6195011337868481

2007-02-18,4.0,"I love Furama.  I have found the food to be as consistent as the Phoenix - which is pretty much the gold standard for Dim Sum in Chicago.  And Dim Sum ""consistent"" is a pretty variable term, since the food is on rotating cart - meaning it can be fresh from the kitchen, or on its 5th lap around the restaurant. The staff is mostly teenagers who can be a little sullen, but are usually helpful.  Several times, they've gone back to the kitchen to grab us specific dishes that we couldn't find on the carts. They also make excellent bubble tea, probably my favorite banana & tapioca in the city! I recommend Furama to northsiders who don't want to make the trek down to Chinatown, or to anyone who doesn't want to wait for an hour at the Phoenix.",0.9697,0.806,0.165,0.029,0.44546783625731
2006-10-29,3.0,"Mediocre dim sum but the extra star is for the fact that it's the only restaurant I know that serves dim sum on the north side.  The choices offered seemed to have decreased and it's like pulling teeth hoping that the cart you want comes around to your table.  For a while, I just sat there watching all the carts sitting in one location, hoping that maybe the powers that be would notice that my table of six was still starving. I give the ""managers"" (I'm not really sure if they were) credit, they were extremely pleasant and tried to address our needs immediately if we caught their attention.  Our waitress was also very helpful. In terms of decor, there really isn't much to look at.  Somewhat similar to a cafeteria but with somewhat of an extra effort to distinguish it as a restaurant.  Basically, no ambiance, you go for for the food. It doesn't compare to getting dim sum at some of my fave locations in Chinatown but when I need quick fix and don't want to make the trek south, Furama will tide me over.  They do have a free parking lot to the side of the building, but don't count on getting a spot in it during the weekends.",0.9777,0.814,0.147,0.04,0.5637037037037037
