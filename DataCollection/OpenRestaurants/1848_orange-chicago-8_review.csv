2017-09-04,4.0,"Cute restaurant. Good customer service. A group of four of us did brunch around 11am on Labor Day and were seated and served in a very reasonable amount of time. If you are looking to indulge, and have no food sensitivities or allergies, Orange is a great place for breakfast or brunch. While I was happy to be able to make substitutions as needed for my own dietary restrictions, it did not seem quite worth the price for my food. I got an omelette (Omelet Five minus the cheese and sour cream) with grilled onions, spinach, and locally-made sausage, and a side of fruit. Tasty, but maybe not worth $13.00. Also, bottomless coffee is $3.50, and very average tasting. It seems like the restaurant is more famous for their french toasts and unique pancake flavors. My roommate absolutely loved his order of Thai-Tea French Toast -- four giant pieces of ricotta-stuffed toast in a sweet, creamy sauce. Unfortunately, those are dishes I cannot have.  And so, that being said, I would not recommend this for people looking to make a lot of allergy-related substitutions. The staff is certainly able to accommodate, but it just doesn't quite feel like you get the bang for your buck if you do.",0.959,0.824,0.126,0.05,0.6022727272727273
2017-09-01,5.0,"One of my Chicago faves! Food: You're going to love whatever you order on the breakfast menu, and I've had it all. I especially recommend the chorizo hash...if you love chorizo, theirs is phenomenal! And if you're in that boat, you're going to be between the chihuahua omelet and the hash, but go with the hash...the omelet is fun but doesn't pack the robust flavor that the hash does. The green eggs and ham are great, as are their other omelets...there's a pretty good value when you go with one of their signature omelets (omelet five is my favorite, comes with chicken apple sausage and a nutty sour cream on top) instead of building your own. The breakfast burrito is killer and you can sub regular chorizo in for the vegetarian stuff if you'd like. Also, their peppercorn raspberry breakfast sandwich is incredible!  They do super creative and delicious pancake flights that rotate weekly (this week was ""smoothie-themed"" pancakes, including a wildberry, banana chocolate, almond plum, and pineapple mango). Full disclosure, one weekend I ordered a burger that sounded delicious, but came out very well done and it was the only time I didn't enjoy my meal...not enough to knock any stars off, but also means I can't vouch for the lunch menu items. All that aside, what keeps me coming back are the plain old pancakes. I don't know how you all make them, but they are to die for...perfectly spongy without being dense, and just sweet enough so you don't need a ton of syrup. Beverages: Good regular coffee as well as ""orange"" coffee, which is orange-flavored...give it a shot. There's a super fancy juice bar and frushi (fruit sushi) selection, but I haven't dabbled with that to keep the cost of my bill down. Staff: Awesome, they keep coffee and water refilled even when they're busy, and are accommodating and friendly. Atmosphere: It can get crowded, but they have some cool artwork on the walls that's available for purchase and very fun to look at. There are a few tables outside for when the weather is nice. Overall: This is just such a cute place with great, humanely sourced food. Instantly sold since day 1 several years ago, and glad to be closer to frequent more often. When you go, order whatever from the breakfast menu and then the weekly flight of pancakes!",0.9985,0.732,0.231,0.036,0.5525448660354322

2017-03-28,5.0,"Seriously the easiest and most genuine event venue I've ever worked with.  My partner and I had our small family and friends wedding at Orange on Roscoe in mid March. They flipped what is regularly a brunch restaurant into a uniquely cute and cozy venue for our celebration. We held the ceremony and reception all inside. Joseph and Luis were so easy to plan with and made sure that our guests were taken care of and we didn't have to worry about anything. From menu planning, to setup, to working with my budget; everything was taken care of.  We wanted a no frills wedding, but Joseph definitely would have helped us if we wanted something more elaborate. The whole reason we chose the space was for it's uniqueness. The local art on the walls, classic tin ceiling, fun fruit themed decorations, decorative fireplace, and open layout really makes the space full of color and warmth. We really didn't need decorations or anything. It made planning a dream. We used the front space with the fireplace for our ceremony, and dance floor later on in the evening. The main space had one large table setup for our family and friends to eat sitting all together. They also have a sound system that we were able to play our own music from.  Chef Luis created an approachable yet exciting farm-to-table family style dinner that catered to all of our dietary restrictions (vegan, diary free, kosher, etc) without sacrificing flavor. Absolutely delicious! Nobody went hungry and everyone enjoyed the food.  The staff that worked our event were so warm and helpful. They really took care of us and made sure that we had a drink in hand and food on our plates. I couldn't have asked for more from the Orange management, kitchen, and front of house.

Very friendly and colorful inside with a neighborhood feel. When I asked for coffee, our server asked if I wanted regular, decaf, or orange. Pause. Orange? She said, just try some, because a lot of people don't think they'll like it but they do. Well, we were on an adventure, so why not? I had a sip of the orange-laced beverage and passed the cup over to hubby. He really liked it, but I don't even like Bailey's in my coffee, so no more for me. Once I spilled orange juice in my coffee and didn't like that either. This was much more subtle, but it wasn't to my taste. Points for originality, tho! I ordered the vegetarian burrito because it contained locally made veggie chorizo as well as other interesting ingredients: pico de gallo, chipotle sour cream, aged white cheddar in a spinach tortilla. It all worked together beautifully plus there was a salad on the side with balsamic dressing. The tomato on the salad was strange - watery with the peel pulling away. The greens were less than fresh. Not appetizing, that! All in all, I liked the place fine. Its friendly feel, reasonable prices for interesting dishes would bring me back.

The menu looked ginormous and everything sounded good. Orange carries everything you'd expect to find at a typical Brunch establishment, but what they're really known for is their Frushi (fruit sushi). At first I thought it was going to be completely fruit, just dolled up like a maki roll. I was slightly horrified to realize that the reality. Indeed it's an attempt at sushi as the 'rice' in Frushi is actually sushi rice. I'm squeamish when it comes to fruit with rice, therefore I opted out. I did however really enjoy my brunch. I ordered the Chihuahua Omelette, complete with mashed potatoes and toast. The small squiggle of sauce on top of the egg wrap was absolute Umami. So good! If I could put a straw to the sauce, I would slurp that stuff up! The omelette was considerably cheesy from Chihuahua Queso and the internal contents consisted of bell pepper, chorizo, and avocado--a Win in my book! My brunch date and I split between the Omelette and an order of Chocolate Chip Pancakes, +$ for the addition of the Chocolate Chips.  Others at our table ordered the pancake flight, which is a popular item on their menu (quadrants of small sized pancakes in different flavors), and Huevos Rancheros (eggs & nachos).

2016-04-17,4.0,"Two of my girlfriends insisted that Orange was worth the drive out to the city so we drove out on a Wednesday for brunch. Around 1130, we were one of two or three tables. We ordered the frushi and pancake flight (both change weekly) and they were delicious. I had a spinach, feta and ham omelet and it was to DIE for!!!  I also ordered the champagne flight, for $12 you get three smaller sized champagnes. Strawberry, pineapple and pear. They were all delicious and very fresh.  The only reason I'm giving Orange 4 stars is for the service. I work in the industry so I understand if it's busy our server may not be around the table as much. But being one of two or three tables I felt like we were almost a bother to him. He barely came around and I didn't even have the chance to tell him he forgot one of my entree sides because he didn't come over til he brought the check. Maybe he was just having an off day..

We ordered the Hawaiian mix drink and I had the California chicken wrap and my friend had some stack sandwich deal. My friend really enjoyed his sandwich, we both said the Hawaiian drink was made very flat, had too much ice and no taste at all. My chicken wrap was also pretty bland tasting and I enjoyed the fries on the side more than the entree.

In town for a few days and needed a place to eat that was near the antique shops on Belmont Ave. Glanced at the reviews on Yelp ahead of time, then happened to see it while driving through the neighborhood. We were surprised to walk right in with no wait on a Saturday around 10 AM. That day it was cash only due to register malfunction, so maybe that was why? Anyway, we were in and out of there in less than an hour, so it was pretty amazing! Our server was helpful and friendly, but not overbearing. He even showed us pictures of the specials on his smartphone! How cool. I had a cup of amazing orange flavored coffee - I have never had anything like that before! It had a great flavor without being cloyingly sweet. For my meal I had the omelette 5, which contained spinach, caramelized onions, local chicken sausage, and gruyere cheese. It came with a piece of toast and potatoes. I was pleasantly surprised that the potatoes were more like  mashed redskins instead of fried, and they came in a fancy-looking shape that I can only think to describe as a 'tall hockey puck' (I am not classy). The husband had a vegetarian burrito that came with a side salad, and he seemed to enjoy it. I had a bite, and WOW so much flavor!  It was so nice to have a brunch meal that wasn't super greasy and heavy. The menu states that they do fresh squeezed juices, and FRUISHI... aka, sushi made from fruit!

They make 4 specialty pancakes and then serve silver dollar versions of all of them.  Sometimes the flavor combination are so amazing.  It is a great way to get a variety and I love variety.  They have frushi, I have never tried it but it always looks interesting.  I am not a sushi lover so I am a little apprehensive to try it. You can also create any type of fresh fruit/veggie juice you want.  Cons- The seating is a little tight sometimes with a small child I like more room.  it can get a little pricey for breakfast but it is worth it for an occasional treat.",0.9509,0.75,0.186,0.064,0.4907142857142857

I check in on Instagram each time I go there and people are impressed by the dishes I photograph. (Green eggs and ham, Chai Tea french toast, orange rosemary french toast, pancake flights, fruishi, etc.) Joseph, who runs the Instagram page even gives out free entrees if you hashtag #OrangeChicago each week for one lucky winner. I've won before and am always pleased each time I go back. The service is impeccable and they don't bother you too much either, which is a plus for me. Cucumber water is always filled and the food comes out rather fast which is nice as well. I can't think of any complaints. If I had to pick one... I would say... if you show up during peak hours, you might have to wait to sit down. Very popular, so I completely understand.

Not too spicy, perfectly cooked poached eggs, served with potatoes which were delicious, but mostly untouched because portion sizes are substantial.  We also ordered an omelette which was perfectly prepared and our ""healthy"" contribution to the meal. Our carrot cake pancakes were quite tasty- fluffy and not too sweet. The seasonal Pumpkin Ginger cakes were very gingery (which we like, but might be too overwhelming for some). Both pancake dishes were topped with ""puddles of goodness"", as my dining partner noted- not too sweet concoctions of cream cheese whipped cream or something similar.  But- it gets better!- the Rosemary Orange French Toast was magnificent. So, absolutely delicious. The brioche bread was sliced thick and perfectly battered. It wasn't soggy or mushy inside, but moist with a gorgeous, crisp crust outside. The rosemary orange cream and sliced almonds on top made this dish totally over the top! To polish off our meal we also had bacon, which was cooked just right, and a pretty little fruit plate.

2014-07-30,3.0,"So, the manfriend and I each live near Orange's two outposts. Any time he suggests Orange, I poo poo it, but since it's been ages since I've dined there, I finally caved and agreed to breakfast there. As soon as I sat down with the menu, I recalled why I didn't care for Orange. If you don't like eggs and want to enjoy some breakfast fare, forget the savory side of the menu; your options are basically limited to pancakes and waffles. All of these items are sweet dishes, so if you're not really in the mood for a sugar infused breakfast, you're kind of SOL. I realize that sounds really high maintenance; my eating habits aren't their problem and I'm not holding it against them. What I am holding against them is their mediocre food and service. He ordered the steak and eggs, which was presented beautifully; it looked like they photographed his order for the website. I ordered plain buttermilk pancakes with chocolate chips and strawberries and a side of breakfast potatoes with cheese. My order wasn't pretty; though as long as my food is good, I don't really care. At first blush, I thought my order was wrong, I thought they forgot the add-ons because they looked like plain pancakes, but it turns out the strawberries and chocolate chips were all mixed into the batter and sank to the bottom. Strawberries don't hold up to the batter and griddle like blueberries do; the result was pancakes devoid of any strawberry flavor. For chocolate chip pancakes, they were fine; I appreciated that they exercised restraint with the chocolate chips. The potatoes were not what I was expecting; they're less like hash browns and more like chunky mashed potatoes. For a breakfast potato fiend like me, these are a pass. They're not bad, but frankly a better accompaniment for a lunch or dinner. My favorite part of the meal was the green apple juice I ordered; that was excellent and I'd order it again - to go. Food finished and plates cleared, we waited a while for our check in a fairly empty restaurant. So long that I asked if we were expected to go up to pay. Eventually, a server (maybe our server, I think we only saw him when we ordered) came by and dropped the check. If you're an egg lover, you might like this place a lot more; for me, not so much. Proximity to our respective homes is the biggest draw for me.

All fresh squeezed, made-to-order. Stop in to get that to go and get breakfast/brunch elsewhere.  Nothing about the breakfast I got was good. Decent, sure, but not good. My eggs were over cooked and the meat in them was dry. My dish was supposed to have ""oven roasted tomatoes"" which were basically sliced tomato that was warmed in the oven. On top of that, I only got about two small slices for my entire dish. Then the house potatoes? They aren't your typical American fries, sliced potatoes or hash browns. They were mashed potatoes. That's right; a restaurant that ONLY does breakfast and lunch feature mashed potatoes as their ""house potato."" If they were creamy, buttery and delicious, I wouldn't complain, but they were just plain ol' boring, dry potatoes. I felt like their menu was very deceiving; giving these descriptions of delicious food, yet when it came to your table, it was subpar.

Finally, when I let him know that my scramble was missing the chicken apple sausage inside of it, he did not apologize. He just walked away to tell someone. I did not get charged for the extra sausage on the side they brought out later, but I also feel they should have comped the scramble or at least the extra charge for that ingredient. Also, my boyfriend's eggs Benedict's tasted really bad, and the eggs were too runny.  My scramble (without the sausage inside) was actually pretty good and so was the side chicken apple sausage.

2014-04-14,5.0,"Disclaimer: I am a breakfast person. I am predisposed to like any place that provides me with pancakes, eggs, waffles, etc., particularly if they have interesting combinations to them. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed this place. It wasn't just standard buttermilk pancakes with maple syrup fare; they have created some very interesting, ever changing combinations that would make it nearly impossible to get sick of this place. The pancake flight is a stroke of genius - 4 small portions of different types of pancakes, which change weekly. I've monitored the weekly pancake flights online for awhile now, and they always sound delectable, so of course, that's what I got. I commented to my dining companion that no matter how many times I came here, I don't know how I'd ever be able to stray from the pancake flight because having FOUR different types of interesting pancake combinations as opposed to picking one thing off the menu will always seem like the better option to me. That kind of sucks because some of the standard menu options - the cinnamon roll pancakes, the chai tea french toast - sound delicious too! Even the omelets and the multiple variations on eggs benedict sounded tasty. My carnivorous (not typically a breakfast person) boyfriend found the steak and eggs benedict to be one of the best breakfast dishes he's ever tried. I may just make a breakfast person out of him yet. The frushi, while clever, is a bit of a gimmick, though. There were certain pieces that I thought were absolutely delicious while others were really just cut-up fruit. Overall, probably not worth the price you're paying, but they're cute. Orange also has make your own juice options. They have various bases and add-ins as well as recommended combinations, and you can create some delectable masterpieces that you'd maybe never find in a store. I would definitely come back to Orange, and I'd probably continue coming to this specific location too.

Their boozy drinks are okay. Nothing to write home about, but when you need to hair the dog a little bit they do the trick.  The frushi is fine - I mean it's really cute and fun but it's just $13 for fruit on rice.  I will say that I crave their lemon blueberry french toast. They do it right for sure. It's sweet without being too sweet (for me) and they make the french toast the littlest bit crunchy (aka. how it's supposed to be.) I've never gotten their omelets but I have stolen several bites from other people and they are very good.

They also offer orange-infused coffee. This location offers outdoor and indoor seating. I came here with two friends, one of whom is vegetarian. Honestly, we wanted to go to Victory Banner but it was closed until the end of August. We decided on here because of the fruishi. We dined outside. I got the classic eggs Benedict (made with Canadian bacon) with a side of mashed potatoes. The Benedict was artfully plated. Taste wise though, it was not memorable nor filling. It was bland. The eggs were properly runny when broken over the English muffin. However, the texture was off in that when I bit into the toasted muffin, I thought I bit into an eggshell. It took me some time to verify that it was not an eggshell. In addition, the mashed potatoes lacked flavor and got cold quickly. My friends enjoyed their meals though. My vegetarian friend enjoyed the vegetarian burrito, which was quite large. My other friend ordered the fruishi and liked it.

This is a good deal for a group (there were 5 of us) if everyone likes a morning mimosa. We got the orange infused coffee, which I will pass on in the future.  Several stand outs from the Orange menu are the frushi- which is fruit sushi. Its adorable and tasty and fun! Also a great menu option is the flight of pancakes. What pancakes are offered changes and you get 4 small stacks of mini pancakes, a perfect option for someone who just can't choose.

2013-06-10,2.0,"To be perfectly honest, the main reason we chose to go to Orange on Roscoe is that it opens earlier than some other restaurants. It's a cute place. First the good. Breakfast wrap very good and hot. Pancakes light and tasty. Not so good, two eggs any style. They come with flavored mashed potatoes, formed in a neat circle. In my opinion, mashed potatoes are for dinner, not breakfast, especially not lukewarm... no, not even lukewarm, my mashed potatoes were cold and mealy. Also, I was asked my bread preference. I ordered an English muffin, and to my complete surprise, there was a 50 cent up-charge. That would have been fine, if 1. it was not  ice cold when I received it, so butter would not melt on it. 2. if I had been told of the up-charge when all the bread options were given. Also my muffin did not arrive with my eggs, so while my eggs cooled, I waited for the English muffin. It was dry, dry, dry, and as I mentioned before, butter would not melt on it. For the price charged(which, by the way, I think may have cost more than if I had ordered each item individually),  the taste did not justify the pricing. The coffee was good, but pricey, as well. Does each person who orders coffee get charged $3.99 each, or is that per table?  Not sure.  All in all, I was disappointed with Orange on Roscoe. Really, nothing about it would make me want to go back. Maybe my sub-par breakfast was not the norm, or I ordered the wrong thing. Still, it could have easily, with some attention to timing and temperature, been better than it was. I do not mind paying for good food. This was not good enough.

2012-08-04,5.0,"True essence of the word BRUNCH! Loved this gem of a restaurant!!!! I went with my 2 yr. old for breakfast and I ordered the Orange-rosemary French Toast!!!!! Yep that's right-  ROSEMARY on French Toast? Who'd a thunk it???? LOL!! I love my French toast and anytime I can try a new twist on taste, I have to have it. I tried it.......MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.....SO DELICIOUS!!!!! I recieved 4 big wedges of French Toast covered in this creamy reduction of cream with rosemary, topped with toasty sliced almonds and powdered sugar, a bit of chopped rosemary  and of course the decorative twisted slices of oranges (which my son devoured) and we dug in!!!! The rosemary taste is so savory but not overpowering at all, the wedges had a nice texture too, not soggy at all. I REALLY enjoyed my coffee and breakfast here.  My two year old had an order of crispy bacon and we ordered a fruit plate. It was overflowing with sliced pears, green apples, ripe bananas, watermelon, strawberries, canteloupe, honey dew, and of course the slice of orange in the center. We loved it all!!!!!  I have to try the rest of the menu, but now I know of my new brunch gem!  The food is definitely worth the money and although it's not your regular, run of the mill breakfast place, you can see in the presentation that the food is their work of art. Everything on the menu sounds delish down to the tropical tasting pancakes. I might try the guava ones. The seating inside is very spacious and there is a small patio in the front.

We waited for about 30 minutes - typical for any brunch place on the weekends in the city.  After sitting, our server was just simply rude - that feeling that if we talked too slow, the server might just walk away in frustration/anger.  We started with the ""Frushi"" - DO NOT ORDER FRUSHI if you like money in your wallet rather than in other people's wallets.  While it was tasty, it was so simple and overpriced that we felt embarrassed afterwards.  Just a slice of fruit, on rice, with a tasty sauce poured all over them.   The entrees were VERY small for chicago brunch standards.  Such tiny portions of hash-potatoes on the plates that just a few bites and you are done.  I was very disheartened by the fate of this experience.  Poor customer service (I understand the place is busy... but you gotta give attention to the customers rather than worrying about moving people in and kicking them out quickly).  Poor portion sizes.  And poor entree pricing for what you get.

I had the build-your-own scramble and it was like the Beth D. special.  I chose spinach, mushroom and asparagus, and requested egg whites.  You can do that here without being scrambled in the wallet - there's no charge.  After ordering, it occurred to me that I hadn't asked for the scramble to be dry.  I've been burned by a too-wet scramble a few times...or should I say drowned (ha! yes I should!).  Luckily, it was not necessary as the eggs were fine and the vegetables too.  It must have been cooked or baked even, in a crock of some kind, because it took on that shape.  Fine with me.

I have always ordered the same thing on the menu every time I have come.

It's really a shame, as there have been many times I have wished to order something else and I wanted to omit an item and they have said no.

The Cinnamon Roll pancakes are amazing; they taste just like a high end, gooey cinnamon roll. The pancake flights are creative; four sets of silver dollar pancakes all with different toppings/sauces linked by a common theme that changes weekly. The savory brunch items are equally as good and creative (both in taste and presentation) and their potatoes are awesome. In addition to incredible food Orange has a juice bar where you design your own blend of juices (Pear, Watermelon and Lime is my personal favorite) and some of the best coffee in town (your choice of traditional coffee or orange infused coffee). Nothing is plain or ordinary at Orange; even the water is cucumber infused. There is also a really fun appetizer dish called frushi; it is fruit served over fruit infused rice designed to look just like sushi (a Nigiri Roll and a Maki Roll); it is even served with chopsticks! Orange can become rather crowded on weekends for brunch, but is well worth either waiting for or waking up early to beat the crowd.

Not only that the closest ATM is down the street at a gas station. REALLY! You give me no warning of this until I get my check!?! I love my friends and all but would rather not stick them or have myself get stuck, with the check! Also, to use the ATM I pay the ATM fees and my bank fees. It would be one thing if I had never been there before and was unaware of previous policy. This was not the case. All previous visits we had we were allowed to use more than one credit/debit card or split checks. Therefore to just have a change in what type of payment is allowed without any signage or warning, besides a sticker inside the bill was irritating. My poor sister had to pay for everyone as we scrambled to figure out who would owe who and who would pay so we could get back to school and work on time. I also hear it will eventually be cash only.

However, the food was great and we liked the restaurant itself.  We didn't order juice and felt a little judged by our server when we said we only wanted water a coffee but in hindsight, this was the right decision b/c their custom juice is probably $24 / glass.

Orange's potatoes we're really good - if I had anything to say about them, it would be that they were too spicy in flavor (not tempurature). My biggest criticsm would be the service.

2010-08-31,4.0,"Another catch up review that my wife, oldest daughter and I all experienced together. My wife and daughter have been to Orange on Roscoe before. I've even had friends stop here too. Everybody has always raved about the food and service. So it was about time this older Yelper decided to give Orange a try.  So I ordered the Orange Rosemary French toast. The French toast is infused with orange juice then baked until warm and crisp. Topped with a sweet rosemary cream reduction and sliced almonds. Garnished with powdered sugar, rosemary & orange slices. This was really delicious! I have been on a orange, mango, tangerine type of kick lately. I really enjoyed my French toast.  This is some of the best French toast around.  My wife ordered the Omelet #6. This is stuffed with asparagus (which Maria just LOVES, almost as much as she loves me, I think) and forest mushrooms, sautéed with garlic and marjoram (wild oregano) mixed with aged jack cheese, topped with toasted almonds & drizzled with a rich balsamic reduction. Maria liked it a lot except for the balsamic reduction.  I of course got to sample her dish (it's good to be me) and thought it was just average.  Our oldest daughter ordered the pesto egg with bacon. Man this was really good. She of course let dear, old Dad have some and I really enjoyed it a lot.  My daughter said she loved it too. Even Maria sampled a little bit and really liked it too.  Overall our server was friendly. The food was served hot and quick.  The place is very clean.  Our total bill came to roughly $50 dollars. I would say Orange on Roscoe is another fine Chicago breakfast/brunch/lunch place.

2010-08-29,4.0,"I've got one word for you: Frushi.  Yeah, that's right. Fruit and sushi have had a love child and they are calling it Frushi.  Frushi isn't the most filling food in the world, but the bottom line is that it is an amazing new experience if you've never tried it.  We got a plate for the entire table and it ran about $ 7.50, for 8 pieces or so. But if you order more, the price goes down. Either way, it was delicious and reminded me of the pineapple rice that I use to eat on occasion when I studied in China, only better because it came on a bed of delicious fruit puree. A general rule of thumb for this place is that you should be careful because you can easily rack up a $100 bill for four people if you go all out.  In fact, the cost of trying all the neat amenities (e.g., frushi or fresh squeezed fruit juices) is the only reason I didn't give the place five stars.  My family and I split a couple dishes and were able to try multiple items and this probably the best plan of attack. We had the pancake flight and one of the omelets, and both were unparalleled.

A few days later our waiter at their new  location on Clark mentioned they are phasing the oatmeal out so guessing that's why they didn't have any in Roscoe Village. I opted for the homemade granola from the special menu. It was very tasty and healthy (yay), although I also indulged in much of my mom's chilaquiles.

I loved the variety and the idea of it, but the pancakes themselves fell short of the moist, lightly sweet, fluffy and buttery goodness I demand in pancakes.

2010-07-25,2.0,"My husband, our cousin and I had brunch here yesterday and it was one of the worst restaurant experiences I've had in all of Chicago. Our waitress, Katie, was nice enough at first as she was very polite in taking our order and knowledgeable about the menu.  However, the service quickly went downhill from there.  As she was taking our order I made two simple requests, a water refill and a straw for my water.  It was pretty hot yesterday and being 8 months pregnant I need to stay hydrated.  We were then promptly ignored by Katie for about the next 20 minutes.  Thankfully others at my table didn't want their water and I just drank theirs. When our food arrived (served by a food runner and not our waitress) I was quite surprised by my ""veggie burger.""  Now I put this in quotes because the food that was served to me was good, but by no means should it ever have been called a ""veggie burger.""  It was more of a soft patty of chopped up vegetables mixed with breadcrumbs.  The fruit plate, which cost nearly $3 extra by the way, was a joke.  It was terribly small and included sliced fruit.  Not a good sign when a restaurant is too cheap to include full strawberries with a fruit plate.  The plate also included a disgusting nearly rotten grape that never should have been served to the customer.  From having worked as a server I know this is the kind of thing that should be caught by any number of people - the person who prepared the fruit medley to the person who served it to the customer.  All this said about my food, the reason the restaurant got two stars and not one is because the food, while overpriced and misnamed, was tasty. Our server passed our table when we were about half way through our food and looked at the table, but did not ask how we were doing.  She then proceeded to the bar area of the restaurant, where I watched her chat with her coworkers for a few minutes.  Keep in mind, our waters still had not been refilled at this point.  Minutes later Katie finally did refill our waters and ask how we were doing. At the end of the meal Katie presented the check without us asking.  When I set down my credit card she informed us that their credit card machine was broken and therefore they could only accept cash.  She said there was a sign on the door, which I certainly didn't see, but that she probably should have reminded us at the start of the meal.  You think?  This is important information, as not everyone these days carries cash.  Thankfully, we had enough money to pay and get out of there.  I will NOT be back and will advise others to steer clear as well.",0.8843,0.859,0.086,0.055,0.5277998236331569

My only regret is waiting to long to have tried it and not having more opportunities to test out other offerings on the menu before leaving the Chicago for New York. First, the orange infused coffee is done quite well. It's not overwhelmingly orange flavored like I had feared, but rather infused with a hint of orange as the name would suggest. Just enough to get the aroma of coffee with a hint of orange in the nose and a touch of flavor that's accentuated a bit by the addition of cream.  I tried the Chai Tea French Toast as others here have recommended and yes, yes, yes they are right. Go for it. It is by far the best french toast, nay, brunch plate, I have ever had (and I have had my fill of brunches!).  I'm going to go ahead and call out Amanda H below - I definitely understand why you might have not been expecting the breakfast potatoes to be the way they were, but I'm going to disagree with you on the point. I liked the fact that they were different from the normal extra-crispy to burnt mash of potato-like substance w/ peppers peddled by most other brunch places in Chicago. They're different, but I think quite good.  In any case, the next time you're waiting and hour and a half outside in the freezing cold for a table at Nookies, give up and give Orange a try.

Try the Chai Tea French toast! I was definitely that annoying person saying loudly, ""OMG OMG OMG."" And I probably swore. My filthy mouth gets even worse when I am impressed with something. That french toast deserves the whole 5 stars. It has the consistency of banana nut bread and when I heard ricotta cheese was in it I thought, ""how disgusting."" Luckily, I tried my friends, and now it's my favorite.  The orange coffee was pretty delicious. I've never had the fresh squeezed juices because I couldn't decide on the flavors. However, the cucumber water was very satisfying. I've also had the green eggs and ham. Out of sight!

The Chicken California Wrap- if you want more of a lunch- GET IT. Oh man, delicious! Everyone raves of the fruishi but, eh, I could definitely never eat it again and be satisfied.  The only reason I deducted a star was because of price and service. Every dollar of mine I have to make count. So this place to me is a treat. I can't eat there often.  And finally service. Usually I have great service, but the service I had recently was SO BAD I am now judging Orange based upon that. My waiter completely ignored us. It was so bad that another waiter- Garrett saw us looking around wondering why Shawn was checking on all his tables but us. Pretty much Garrett took care of us and Shawn came back to be a jerk and literally throw our food and chop sticks at the table. Unreal. First time in a long time I had to force myself to give a really bad tip (10%). I felt bad but I remembered feeling completely offended by our waiters behavior.

I love their omelet with the asparagus, mushrooms, and almonds. It is SOOOO GOOOD! And I think it is spectacular that I can arrange to have Sweet Potato Fries with my breakfast. Uncommon, but fantastic! Friends of mine have had their pancakes (the cinnamon bun ones come to mind), and after stealing a nibble, I realized that they are great.  Orange has a nice atmosphere. The staff are friendly. Neighborhood is great. The waitresses I've had could be a little more attentive, but it was nothing terrible.  I make a trip out there whenever I can (I know they have other locations, and the Roscoe location is the furthest away from where I live, but I somehow always end up heading there), and am always pleased.

My son ordered the kids scrambled eggs and the pancakes. The eggs were over cooked and browned. Scrambled eggs are so gross when they are browned and dry. Scrambled eggs should be light and fluffy. He did not like the potatoes at all. I ordered the chicken wrap. The waitress sold me on it because of the mango salsa. So I tried it. I took a few bights and found it dry and blah. I kept looking for her she never came back. After I ate the first half of it I saw her and called her over and asked her about the mango salsa. I asked her to bring the menu back over and sure enough it said mango salsa. So she apologized said said the fruit chef went home already for the day and thought perhaps that was the reason why. I had also heard her tell a few people they could not have the fruit sushi for the same reason. So I suppose if you want the full menu as written you need to arrive while the fruit chef is still there. So my waitress tells me she will check with the kitchen to see why they did not give me the mango salsa. 15 mins later she appears with a bowl of mango salsa. Not only was it mangos but it was tomato and onions. My wrap did not have any of those ingredients no wonder it was so blah it was chicken, lettuce, jalapeno mayo (which was also lacking any flavor or kick of the jalapeno pepper.) At this point I was over it. She offered me the salsa but what was I do do unroll my wrap add it then continue eating. We might try another location this one was blah. Sadly what I enjoyed most was the cucumber water. It was yummy. Also I won a gift certificate for there that says I can only use it M_F and with a 50 min. WTF!

This time around I stopped at Orange on Roscoe (and Damen). Obviously, it was a Saturday morning so it was crowded. I had a slight issue with our host at the beginning because he was overly flustered and seemed a little stressed. I understand it's busy, but when the service looks stressed, it's going to make the customers stressed. With that said, we were seated by the front windows which was the best seat in the house. We started with the orange-infused coffee...awesome! I thought the hint of orange put a fantastic spin on boring old coffee. For my main dish I decided to go a little off my usual and tried the French Toast Kabob. The French Toast Kabob is coconut-infused French toast with fresh strawberries, pineapples, served with a coconut-mango salad. I have to say, this was INSANE. A real explosion of flavor. initially, it looked intense but I was overwhelmed with the taste. I've never had French toast without syrup and I don't know if I could go back!

I enjoy poached eggs and I enjoyed their steak, the balsamic reduction was adding a sweet and sour flavor that did not sit well with the rest of the plate.   I had to take the egg and the steak off of the bread cuz the bread was too much.  I tasted everything together and it was fine, but it would have been way too much for me to handle. I think that's what got to me, there was too much bread involved in everything that they served.  They had 16 different kind of pancakes, and when all you wanted was something that wasn't an orange infused explosion of syrup of a pancake they made fun of you on the menu.  Oh my god, get over yourself. BTW learn how to grill a medium rare steak, which it was a nice color on the inside but the amount of char on the outside of the steak was not ok.

My boyfriend had the omelet number 6, which had leeks and a balsamic reduction. Over all I think the food was good and the presentation was wonderful and the service was good. The only complaint that I have is that the menu is VERY limited and in my opinion, over priced, especially the substitution prices. For instance, it cost $2.50 to substitute a salad or fruit or french fries instead of their home style potatoes! Not to mention, you cannot make custom omelets! I think for what they charge, you should have a little bit more freedom with the menu.",0.9439,0.831,0.136,0.033,0.48469387755102045

I still appreciate their signature orange coffee, but have to admit the quality of their food (at least at this location) has really gone down.",0.9351,0.798,0.147,0.055,0.5225213675213676

I ordered the #6 omelet, my brunch companion also ordered an omelet.  When the food came, I noticed that the omelet was merely an envelope of scrambled eggs with the ingredients sandwiched in-between.  The cheese, asparagus and mushrooms were not mixed together with the eggs, they didn't even seem like they were cooked together.  They were not attached to the eggs in any way, just enveloped between them.  Perhaps we were distracted so much by this to not notice that our barely luke warm food had gone ice cold.  I dove into the potatoes - ICE cold.  I know we should have complained, but to our failure, we didnt.  I think we were just shocked at our ruined brunch experience and that a place as reputable as Orange would have caused it.  Cold, bland and unimpressive food is not what we want for brunch.

The grilled cheese was delicious and way better than the omelette I had last time I was at Orange. Three stars because the service here is just terrible.

It was just ok.  I, of course, had the eggs benedict, which was nothing to write home about. It was just your standard eggs benedict, and I don't really remember it that well actually.  My husband had the green eggs and ham (eggs with pesto), which was a little dry and just ok.  We each had one breakfast cocktail him-a bloody mary. Me- a mimosa. His bloody wasn't that great...just a standard bloody mary. My mimosa was good. So, I guess they at least got that right...but, how bad would it be if they screwed up a drink that has 50% of the ingredient they're named after?

2009-11-03,4.0,"Yes. No. Maybe? Oh, God, I'm so confused! Orange is hard to review. On the one hand, the food I've had was pretty great, the service was friendly, and I had a great brunch with my girlfriend and the roomie.  On the other hand, the prices are pretty high for a brunch joint, the place is a biiit on the pretentious side, and I think the owners are trying to expand too quickly. It seems like having fewer great restaurants would be better than a ton of mediocre ones, but who am I to judge? I was lucky. You see, while I really like my meal at Orange, it would have come out to $50.00 plus tax and tip for 3 people eating only juice and french toast/pancakes. That seems a bit nuts since I could get french toast and juice in any diner for $5-6 per person. So by lucky, I mean that I had a $25.00 gift certificate, so the meal came back down to a pretty normal range. The food was great: we each had a cup of fresh juice (you can customize your own from a list of fruit and veggie options), a had the chai french toast, my gf the pancake flight (chocolate themed that week), and my friend the orange rosemary french toast. To better gauge the food (or perhaps because we're all just that indecisive) we shared around the table. Both of the french toast plates were awesome. I really enjoyed both for different reasons. My chai was definitely on the sweet side, but with the fresh juice, it was nicely balanced. The orange rosemary was straight up incredible and I had more than my fair share. The pancake flight was just okay. I think the issue is partly that too much chocolate would be overwhelming in the flavor department but too little left the pancakes dry. I don't know that the people at Orange found the right amount (I'm not sure there is a right amount, but I'm also not a huge fan of straight up chocolate). The service was attentive and polite and the music selection was just douche-ily hipster enough to be fun. Hopefully we'll make the time to go back sometime in the near future, again with gift certificate, and score some amazing french toast.  As a side note, I wish the owners hadn't stopped late night brunch at some of the other locations. We're rarely all awake, not working, and not otherwise busy before they close for the day, but we'd definitely make late night visits happen.",0.9989,0.709,0.261,0.03,0.556765289449113

Weird.  The waitress came over shortly there after and gave us the rundown on whats what.  Apparently they do their own juice concoctions, they have orange infused coffee and have a special omlete and pancake for the season.  The concept sounded cool, but we ended up just ordering off the standard menu.  My wife orded eggs benedict and I had the #11.5 omelet.  My omelet was good, hers however was BORING.  If you put Eggs Benedict on your menu, it needs to be something special.  This was not, dry English Muffin, canadian bacon and a poached egg.  The potatoes they serve on the side are gross.  Who wants smashed potatoes for breakfast?  And if they are smashed potatoes call them that, don't call them home fries.  If I have potatoes for breakfast I want to be able to eat them with Ketchup.  Annoying.  My wife asked the server for a sliced tomato to add to her Eggs Benedict.  It took her a while to bring it back and when it arrived it was quartered.  Not the right form factor to make it easy to eat with the Eggs Benedict.  When the bill came I found they charged us $1.50 for the tomato.  Even more annoying.   We left with a bad vibe.  I won't be back.",-0.8484,0.853,0.063,0.084,0.44889770723104055

There was a very warm, open and inviting feel to the main room, and most shocking--we were able to be seated right away, despite the crowd and it being 11 am on a Sunday.  I ordered the #6 omelet which had some very interesting ingredients in it. That's one thing I noticed about this place that I really appreciated: the variety of creative ingredients in typically traditional brunch items. (Hence their sign calling this place ""contemporary brunch"".) Instead of the ol' standby ham, cheddar cheese, green peppers, etc. my omelet was filled with some goodies including asparagus and aged jack cheese and topped with an AWESOME balsamic reduction sauce. They give you a side of potatoes, which had good flavor and presentation but were too dry for my taste. They needed to add in a lil sour cream or something to their mixture.  My handsome dining companion got an eggs benedict dish and opted for the side greens instead of potatoes. His dish was fabulous, but he did leave a bit hungry, despite also ordering a side of veggie sausages. (Kind of an oxymoron, but dang, those little guys were good.)

We both decided that was a bad choice though...I applaud their attempt at creating an interesting coffee twist, but some things just don't need to be messed with.

2009-09-19,3.0,"Blog for the review w/ pics Arriving around 8:45am Chicago time we found easy parking merely a block away and made our way to the entirely empty restaurant - a stark difference from the loud and jam-packed previous Chicago breakfast experiences.   True to its name the inner decor of the restaurant was quite eclectic with wall art depicting carrots, abstracts, and figures all in varying shades of Orange - even the ceiling consisted of ornate peach tile.  Standing up from his own stack of pancakes at the bar our quirky server seated us quickly and provided us menus while explaining the daily specials - including mango frushi and the ""back to school"" pancake flight.  Returning shortly with glasses of water (oddly containing a slice of cucumber) he next took our drink orders - tea for my sister and ""orange coffee"" for myself.   Returning with our drinks my sister was presented with a small pot of hot water and a choice of 6 tea bags - choosing a chai she noted it was ""alright"" but was disappointed with the small selection and only receiving one tea bag - much different from the box of teas at Bogo Room.  For myself the orange coffee was true to its name and tasted like a strange blend of fresh squeezed OJ and mildly acidic coffee - while I'm not sure how this concept was derived I will admit that the interesting tang was a surprise and I drank a good 32-40oz during the course of the meal.   Arriving ~20 minutes after placing orders our food was presented fresh and hot and in much larger portions than expected.  Unable to decide on just two options my sister and I each opted for a dish while also ordering a plate of the pan seared oatmeal to share.  Beginning with the oatmeal we were served two large slices that were creamy and hot on the inside while crispy and singed on the outside.  Made by first baking the oats in apple cider the dish had a distinctly autumnal flavor to it that was only enhanced by the addition of fresh maple syrup.  Accompanying the oat-toast was a melange of cranberries, apples, raisins, and pears.  The most unassuming of the choices but the best of our selections I was extremely impressed by the oatmeal and will be looking to replicate the dish in my own home in the future.   The second choice, the selection of my sister, was the Chai Tea French Toast featuring large/thick slices of brioche infused with chai tea and stuffed with Ricotta cheese served in a large bowl over chai tea latte reduction and then topped with honey & caramelized apples.  Well composed and actually quite well balanced this dish was absolutely enormous and clearly more than enough for one.  While I personally didn't sense the chai as much as I'd have liked, the creamy ricotta was so well blended that it nearly seemed to be part of the bread and the honey/apple mix was quite well done with small hints of spice and salt balancing the overall sweetness of the dish quite nicely.   The final selection, mine, was the Back to School Pancake Flight - a weekly rotating theme at Orange with four stacks of three silver-dollar pancakes, each stack featuring a different batter and/or topping.  Given my love of both tasting menus and pancakes I figured this option was a can't miss - unfortunately I was incorrect.  With options including ""breakfast of champions - buttermilk cakes infused with bacon and topped with light yellow cheddar mousse,"" ""energy rush - orange coffee infused buttermilk cakes topped with chocolate marshmallow whipped cream and cocoa powder,"" ""lunchroom - buttermilk cakes with peanut butter cream and homemade raspberry jelly plus banana whipped cream,"" and ""teachers pet - buttermilk cakes with poached red apple in red wine with apple cider-cinnamon reduction"" I expected greatness and variety but instead received chewy similarity.  Boring and chalky pancakes, minimal amounts of topping, and variation dictated only by the ""cream or mousse"" on each I found myself having difficulty differentiating the energy rush from the breakfast of champions and the teachers pet was so flavorless I questioned the presence of apples.  Admittedly the Lunchroom was excellent - if I ever returned I'd order the jelly roll pancakes based on this.   In the end I have to say I was largely underwhelmed by Orange and this all had to do with something I'd heard from others - inconsistency.  While some dishes were excellent others were sub-par, while the scene was nice the techno-pop music was loud and quite off-putting, while some portions were generous the skimpy tea service was unimpressive at best.  While Orange is indeed interesting and unique compared to other cities, I simply don't think it stands out enough compared to other venerable Chicago breakfast/brunch options to warrant a strong recommendation or return visit.",0.9988,0.823,0.15,0.027,0.523140457733481

2009-07-07,3.0,"The link above is our video DINE-aries from our brunch @ Orange.  Overall, Orange was OK.  The food definitely looked better than it tasted for some of the dishes.  I had the Fruit French Toast Kabob and the presentation was beautiful but as for taste, it fell a little flat.  The French Toast was huge but dry.  There wasn't enough fruit sauce in ratio to the size of the toast.  The Chai Tea French Toast was Amazing!  I would definitely get that again.  It came in a really cute bowl and chai tea with the french toast was a perfect combination.  Also, it was filled with ricotta cheese.  Because of the size of the french toast, having it with a filling inside made it even more enjoyable. The Omelette 11.5 was not impressive.  They were not generous with the avocado mousse and the dish overall was pretty bland.  Again, it looked better than it tasted. The Green Eggs & Ham was really good.  The Pesto scrambled eggs with ham seemed great together.  The potatoes tasted a lot better with Louisiana Hot Sauce. The freshly squeezed juices again sounded better than it tasted.  It could also be that I got an apple, pear, & grape combination.  Maybe next time I'll try a different mix of fruits, but to me, it wasn't worth the money to spend. So 2 out of 4 dishes were good which is why I gave it a 3 star rating.  I love the neighborhood location it's at and we didn't have to wait long to be seated.  I also liked the atmosphere of the restaurant, and it wasn't one of those places that was crowded and cramped.  It is definitely very spacious and felt inviting.",0.9973,0.733,0.24,0.027,0.4967054263565893

2009-05-24,5.0,"I was a loyal visitor of the Orange at Clark and Belmont and now I don't even have to hop on a train, I can walk to Orange! It's a wonderful thing! I admit when it first opened, the food quality was not quite on par and the service was super slow, but they have really improved over the last few years! I always have the orange infused bottomless coffee, despite the fact that I am not supposed to drink the stuff that often. It's too good to resist! I always have the frushi of the day as well, it's a wonderful thing! Slightly different every time, you might have coconut infused rice with fresh strawberries, or maybe pineapple infused rice with sliced grapes and berries, whatever is in season.  The main dishes are also delicious. I am in love with the caprese Benedict. Simple as it may be, anything that's prepared perfectly is worth the spend. Other yummy delights include the pancake flights (!) which change in theme weekly. Some flights I have adventured though were chocolate themed, earth wind and fire themed (earth = oreo cookie/gummi worm aka dirt pudding topped pancakes, wind was blueberry reduction with marshmallow like clouds, and fire was some red hots with a cinnamon reduction), cocktail themes, the ideas are endless. I've also had their omelettes, the Popeye omelet is probably my favorite. I wish I had thought to put balsamic reductions on eggs myself! The chai tea infused french toast and chai kabobs are also good, but be warned, the chai tea french toast is very sweet and very rich!  I would like to note that the location on Clark street was my favorite for decor and staff. It's a brighter restaurant and the music on the overhead is always indie friendly, but I can't resist writing a stronger review for this location simply because the wait time is always significantly shorter at this location and Roscoe Village for a weekend brunch is a great area to stroll before or after. Either way, an orange location is a good one to visit for breakfast and brunch! (Sorry I haven't attempted lunch or dinner to date.)",0.9985,0.709,0.257,0.034,0.5519319727891158
2009-05-16,5.0,"I have found my new favorite breakfast place.  The drive into the city is well worth the deliciousness that I have found at Orange.  To start, we shared a pot of bottomless orange-infused coffee which was delicious.  I didn't try the make your own fresh-squeezed fruit juice, but I will try this next time.  We did have the frushi (fruit sushi) and I thought that it was great.  The fruit was fresh, the coconut rice was delicious and the raspberry sauce that I could dip my fruit in made it a winner in my book.  Next I opted for the pancake flight of the week; these change each week and on the day that I went the theme was ""Pop Singers"".  You get 4 stacks of 3 small pancakes and each of the ones that I had were absolutely delicious.  No syrup was needed as they all had fruit, chocolate, peanut butter and more on them.  I also got a side of their ""house potatoes"" and loved them!! I was also happily surprised that they had actual hot sauce to go with my potatoes instead of just Tabasco sauce.  I will agree with another Yelper that it was frustrating that they wouldn't split our check unless we had asked initially (and hadn't told us this until we asked at the end of our meal) and then had a rule that they would only charge 2 credit cards.  However, I felt that the food was well worth my trip to Roscoe Village and there were also some cute shops in the area that you might want to walk around and see - you will feel less full afterwords.  I will be back!",0.9952,0.768,0.209,0.023,0.5588484848484849

I have never heard a restaurant manager talk to a customer like that.  He was so rude!  We were tempted to get up and head next door to Kitsch'n, where we know the food is good, but we were heading out of town and in a hurry and our food was ordered. So about our food. I ordered the pancake flight - I had asked if I could have a regular order of buttermilk pancakes instead of the fruity pebble pancakes, and our server said No.  I thought that was odd considering they have buttermilk pancakes on the menu.   My husband ordered the turkey club with pepperjack cheese and it came out with blue cheese (something he absolutely hates).  The server insisted it was not blue cheese, but later came out and said there was a language barrier with the kitchen staff and that she smelled the cheese and it was in fact blue cheese.  They asked if he wanted to send it back and he did, then ordering a chicken sandwich.  Our food took 20 minutes even though we were the only table waiting for food and my pancakes were completely cold.  I'd rate the food a 3 and the Manager's attitude a ZERO!  We won't ever be going back just because of the way he talked to that poor lady!!",-0.9521,0.909,0.023,0.068,0.4333859626963074

2009-03-15,3.0,"This is an okay choice for brunch, but has some drawbacks. First off, the coffee is absurdly expensive. Sure, it's a ""bottomless"" cup because they put the pot on your table, but if I'm going to spend nearly $3 on coffee it better have foam or something on top. That's a small thing, but sometimes the small things make all the difference when you're choosing between relatively similar places.  It doesn't have much in the way of ambiance -- a big, open room that can get loud -- but the waiters are generally nice.  The rosemary French toast is tasty and the jelly donut pancakes are good. On the other end of the spectrum, the huevos rancheros was a very disappointing dish. I know they were going for gourmet, but it looks so unappetizing that we actually laughed when it arrived. It's a beige mish-mosh -- the flat circle of eggs, the white bean puree, the cheddar. Just a bit of salsa verde gave it a tiny dash of color. The taste turned out just okay, but there's no reason to order them if you're actually wanting something like huevos rancheros.  I can under sand why people like it, but if you're on Roscoe looking for brunch, Orange simply can't compete with Kitschn and Victory's Banner.",0.9695,0.836,0.132,0.032,0.4551616696061141

The rain must have been keeping people at home because we had no trouble getting a table at 11:30 which I understand is usually a busy time.

Hopping off my soap box now; to the food itself. The frushi was both cute and delicious. There was a nice mix of kiwi, pineapple, melon, and nectarine cleverly arranged with the sticky rice and a sweep of strawberry puree.  The chai french toast was delicious and plated nicely in an asymmetrical bowl to allow the french toast to sit in the chai reduction, but still be accessible with a knife and fork.  The french toast had a great texture with the crispy crust but soft ricotta stuffed center.

I also enjoyed their recent fall pancake flight. My sister was not a big fan of the orange coffee, but the waiter was nice enough to comp us on it. Also I think that Orange tries just a teensy bit too hard with some of their artsy presentations, and then they are able to charge a few more dollars for their dishes.

We arrived at Orange this morning around 9:40 and were seated immediately. Good plan! The host told us about the specials, fresh squeezed juice, and trivia cards at each table, a fun touch. Our server was friendly, but didn't quite speak loudly enough for the atmosphere--another Yelper mention stroller parking lot; I can't fathom a better description, and imagine what several babies/toddlers can do to the noise levels. The server let me try the orange coffee, and I actually liked it. Very different than what I've had--the orange flavor is a sweet, fragrant touch to otherwise vile liquid (I know I'm in the minority on this). AND they put cucumbers in the water instead of lemons! I commend them for this, as I discovered the cucumber-in-water phenomenon a couple years ago at a spa, and have wondered ever since why more restaurants don't do it. I ordered the Omelet #11.5: bacon, sweet leeks, avocado spread. It was yummy, but not INCREDIBLE. The egg was alright, it was in between warm and lukewarm, and the flavor combination was tasty, but I was just a tad underwhelmed. The taters were interesting: they were more like mashed (but a salty, little garlicky mash) that had been molded into a wide cylinder shape. The man had two eggs, potatoes, and toast. He wasn't really impressed. I had a pear-pineapple fresh squeezed juice, he had apple. We both reported the juice to be good--I personally like the fresh-squeezed juices at Meli better, though. Honestly, I've had better breakfasts. I appreciate the creativity they're attempting, but something felt lacking in the execution of both our meals. Also, if you're looking for something simple, Orange is not your place--my man commented that everything on the menu had at least one ingredient that didn't sound appealing.

Pros:  The food is excellent.  My favorite dish is the Caprice Benedict.  I also enjoy the cinnamon roll pancakes.  YUM!  I have yet to hear someone complain about the food.  I have two friends that will not step foot in the city unless they are going to a Cubs game.  Over the summer they joined us for brunch at Orange.  Both of them said that they would make a trip out from the burbs specifically to go to this restaurant.  That says a lot.   80% of the time the service is excellent!  Whenever my beverage is low the waiter/waitress is over to replace it.  The servers know their food well and always provide great suggestions when asked. If you are looking for a standard omelet, or regular pancakes, this is not the place for you.  If you are looking to try something unique and delicious then definitely try Orange.",0.9824,0.794,0.156,0.051,0.5294102564102565

The french toast is dry. The omelette's are rather greasy. The potatoes come out as somewhere between baked and mashed, smashed into a cylindrical shape. They are dry and flavorless.  The coffee is not so great, and it's $3.50. Ok, I get that it's a bottomless cup, but that seems a bit dear for coffee. Can't I have the choice to just get one cup then? I might as well get one of their fresh juices- which are a clever idea that do end up good, but they're not enough to bring me back to this place. Also, frushi. I abhor this concept of frushi. eaten with chopsticks! Ack! I adore the art of sushi making, but for some reason this americanized version is just too kitsch for me. Does frushi exist outside of Chicago? And, as my friend observed, the servers are either too cool for school and pissed when you ask for tabasco sauce, or strangely over- attentive.

I was underwhelmed by the menu, not only its originality but also its scope. The frushi, of course, is very original, but to be quite frank I was a little scared of trying it. The concept of the pancake flight is very cool, but the day we went it was candy shop & ice cream themed and looked sugary enough to induce diabetic shock. So I went with my old standby of Eggs Benedict. The portion was rather small and the hollendaise was a bit off. It's very easy to make a less-than-great Eggs Benedict, and their version was just that. I had also been excited about the myriad of juice options that they offer, and chose to get a small pear juice while waiting (for awhile) for my main course. It was absoutely disgusting. It was warm and had obviously been sitting out for awhile, and tasted more like cucumber than pear. Obviously I'm used to ""regular,"" sweetened juices, but there was no excuse for that abomination of taste. Ugh.

Our wait did turn out to be less than 10 minutes, but she did seat at least four parties before us, and she didn't take our name, which all just seemed really confusing.

I'm always suspect of a restaurant that is dead-quiet, even if it is new to the neighborhood and it is the day before fathers day.  The potatoes where so dry they were actually hard to eat.  The omelet  was good in theory but really didn't pull the flavors together very well.  The one thing this place really did right was the Frushi, which I needed explained to me too, it's basically sweetened cold rice served up with pieces of fruit instead of fish like sushi.  It was really tasty and fun, definitely give it a try.",0.945,0.835,0.134,0.032,0.4443272005772006
2007-06-11,4.0,"After several weeks of waiting for Orange to open its doors I finally got to try it this past Sunday.  All in all it was a pretty good experience.  The place was pretty full, but I was seated right away.  My only complaints are: 1. it took a while for them to take my order and 2. after taking my order - it took quite a while before they brought my food.  I can forgive these things because the food was very good.  I had buttermilk pancakes (aka ""boring cakes"") and sausage - both quite delicious.  As for the juice - I ordered pear.  It was very good, but it took awhile before it was at an ideal drinking temperature.  I suspect they keep the ice to a minimum to keep it from diluting the drink.  The atmosphere at Orange is pretty nice.  It's the usual twenty to thirty something Roscoe Village crowd.  Perhaps my favorite atmospheric element was the music.  They played Beatles tracks almost exclusively.  For me the Beatles are synonymous with Sunday mornings.  This is a good restaurant that will soon be great after they have a chance to work out the kinks.  I'll be back.",0.9924,0.728,0.231,0.041,0.6780745341614905
2007-06-07,4.0,"This morning I ventured down Roscoe Street to the new outpost of Orange (in the spot where Brett's used to be).  The place was nearly empty, as I'm pretty sure it was their first day open. The space is significantly smaller than the location on Clark, so I can only hope that they will put up some outdoor seating in the near future.   The menu is identical, and the service was fast and pleasant.  They're not offering a fresh juice menu as of yet, but we were assured that it was on its way - along with the signature pancake flight.   Brunch was predictable and delicious.  Nothing new here except for the dinner menu which is now posted outside, and looks electic and interesting, with entrees priced in the $12-18 range.",0.9513,0.839,0.141,0.02,0.5558878256246679
