2017-08-27,2.0,"I've been here twice before. Once approximately two years ago, and other time just this past week. I really enjoy the atmosphere/ambience. The decor reminds me somewhat of 1910s/1920s America, and I think it's a very cute place to study or even have a coffee date.  However, the most recent time that I was here, the service was disastrously slow, likely due to a problem with understaffing. One single worker was running the cash register, making the drinks, and bringing the food to the tables. There were about 10-12 people in front of me in line when I arrived, and 15 minutes later, only three of them had been helped. I wouldn't say that I'm an impatient person, but it felt absurd to have to wait that long to put in an order (and with 7 more people to be helped before me, was likely going to take quite a while longer). Needless to say, I ended up leaving because it was just too slow. Last time I was here, it didn't seem to be this way. I remember the line moving quickly, and getting my coffee without any issue. They really should hire some more people.",0.2366,0.958,0.023,0.018,0.5387896825396825

2017-07-12,2.0,"I would have probably given them a higher review a year or two ago, but I feel like they've gone downhill lately.   I'll start with the pros: Very cute place. It's in an adorable house and it's honestly quite nice to sit in there and eat and drink coffee. Nobody bothers you if you just want to sit and read or chat with friends. Their selection is food and drinks is pretty vast. Cons: The service is what's gone really downhill. The time before last that I went, it was fairly busy and I ordered a sandwich and drink. I waited for a good 20 minutes, and went back up to the front to ask about it. I guess they forgot about putting the order in so they started on it as soon as I reminded them. Okay, I understand, they were busy, it happens. The last time I went there I was with my fiance and we ordered some sandwiches. The guy at the front was literally trying to get something out of his nose while we were talking to him. My fiance asked for no avocado on the sandwich and they said it wasn't possible. I thought the reason why they take a good 10 or 15 minutes to make the sandwich was because they were making it fresh? Why can't they just not add an ingredient?  I also asked for a iced chai tea, he said they were out. I said ""cool, can you make me some iced tea? Doesn't matter what kind."" He wasn't sure.  So I asked about the loose leaf tea, could he just make loose leaf chai (bc they had loose leaf chai) and then add ice? I brought over the tea to him and explained. He gave me water with ice in it with the tea bag so I ended up drinking iced water with a chai flavor to it. The sandwiches again took about 10 to 15 minutes to make and were Alright but nothing to write home about.  Even my fiance who normally loves it there agreed with me that this place has fallen off the cliff.  I hope they get better one day, but I understand once you have a nice cushy status in Lincoln Park, you're made.

The only reason I continued to eat here is because of the Great Gatsby - it's delicious.....if you actually receive one.  Today I called and ordered ahead a Great Gatsby, Caesar salad and I had a cookie.  The Great Gatsby was missing mayo, bacon, turkey and avocado.  It did have pesto, artichoke on half of it and random olive slices.  Definitely NOT the taste I had been craving and expected when I got home and bit into the sandwich.  I called the restaurant and was told the new guy made a mistake and gave me a veggie panini?  Um....not sure how that happened.  I realize mistakes happen but it was a ton of bread with some random olive slices and a few pieces of artichoke heart on the other half?  I would have asked for my money back even if I had ordered that sandwich because there was barely any product between the bread.  I also waited longer once I arrived to pick up than quoted on the phone so I'm not sure what took so long.  Anyway, I was grateful to get a refund for the sandwich.   Boy do I wish I had dug into the sopping wet salad which was now inedible and crumbly cookie before I hung up the phone.",0.9843,0.802,0.141,0.057,0.4548604173604174

2017-05-09,4.0,"When I visited: 5.24.16 What I got: 12 oz drip, cafe florio blend Drink Review: A darker blend with notes of peach and apricots. Served in a plain white, medium, white paper cup, the drink was unassuming. Getting into the actual drink it was a very smooth dark roast with only a small aftertaste of bitterness. Overall, very drinkable and great for settling in and either getting down to work or fully relaxing on a lazy afternoon.  Cafe Review: 'Cafe' is a bit of an understatement here. The bourgeois pig boasts a large location off Lincoln and Fullerton, with ample seating outside in their front courtyard and additional seating upstairs beyond the initial cafe. Note, there is a restaurant in the building but in a separate room/space adjacent so since you can't seamlessly walk through it to the cafe I'll be omitting it from this review. The overall aesthetic is antique, old wood and old world style. This is the kind of spot you'd expect out of a Hemingway novel, with swing music playing like in a Portillo's. The cafe walls are a combination of old exposed brick and an interesting textured siding I am not familiar with. The whole building isn't just for show either; the whole thing is ""Old Chicago"" down to the foundation (built in 1893) as evidenced by its sneaky supply cellar adjacent to the rather old bathroom set up. (Be aware: the entrance does require numerous stone steps, so beware if stairs don't bode well for you). I for one definitely recommend the second floor of the cafe for those looking for a quieter nook to read, work, or have a more intimate, quiet conversation. Overall, the coffee is solid but not the main focus as the atmosphere of the spot is really the key attraction. Think of a university reading room meets a swing era coffee/sandwich spot.

It is first and foremost a café, with the food being secondary. The facility itself is essentially an old house converted into a café on the first floor, with space to study outside on the patio, and upstairs. It is actually a great set-up insofar as its abundant table space, natural lighting, and lack of crowdedness(generally). For food, I've tried both the Beggar's Opera sandwich(one of their self-reported best-sellers), along the Julius Caesar Salad. Homemade basil pesto, grilled chicken breast, swiss cheese, avocado, and spinach on a sandwich? Sign me up. When I got it though the chicken was pretty dry, and there didn't seem to be enough basil pesto compared to the rest of the ingredients to really salvage that. All in all, it wasn't a sandwich that really came together for me. Salad was actually pretty good, though a normal Caesar salad with chicken breast shouldn't be too much to ask for from most any café. 8/10 for the atmosphere and study space. 6/10 for the sandwiches.",0.9274,0.908,0.081,0.012,0.5634848484848484

The cashier handed me a pile of singles as change, and did not count them.  It just didn't seem right, so I hastily gathered my stuff and found a seat and counted the bills, which were $5 short.  So I got back in line and told her I was shorted.  She said ""well, you walked away, what can I do?""  I guess the burden of proof was on me and the moment was over I have to give her that, i should have been quicker, what can I say.  I went back to my seat and was sitting there trying to work, fuming about my damn $5, when I got the idea to ask her, when her shift was done, if she was over $5, could I come get it.  She said she'd count her drawer for me in a little bit.  After about 20 minutes she comes up to me and says that she was ""only over $1.37"".  Trying to even give her the benefit of the doubt, I asked if she perhaps dropped a $5 under the counter?  She was like ""no I only had singles, I gave you all singles"".  Look reader, I know you don't know me from Adam but I only walked into that place with 2 20s and I had a 20 and 8 singles when all was said and done.  The employee is poorly trained: everyone knows you count the change back to the customer, and she was clearly never taught this. And my situation is why you always count back change to the customer.   The berry scone was fresh and fluffy with lots of berries.  The  coffee was bad, gritty consistency, with a burnt flavor. I think it was just burnt. I really don't think it was Intelligentsia, I have drank it for over 20 years, unless it's just that I never drank it burnt   It was just weird. Anyhow, the menu is formidable, vast. There are a lot of cheesecakes to choose from also. The small sitting area is dark and jam-packed with heavy duty vintage tables and chairs.  The place needs a good dusting, maybe redecorating.   In summary I overpaid for burnt coffee and was shorted $5.  I was so upset that I told myself to wait a few days before posting just to stay objective.  There are a few Starbucks nearby; I recommend using those. I will never set foot in that place again. I you have to eat here, get tea, not coffee and pay with plastic.",-0.7604,0.865,0.064,0.071,0.4434523809523808

2016-11-21,1.0,"So, I haven't made a Yelp review in a long time but unfortunately I have to share this experience because it was without exaggeration, dreadful.  I visited on a Sunday night, and it was fairly busy, which is a good sign. I was meeting a friend so I went up to the counter to order before finding a table to wait. I ordered a hummus plate and a dirty chai with almond milk and then they told me there was a 20 minute wait for espresso. No matter how busy it is, a 20 minute wait for coffee is unbelievable. So I went to sit down. 20 minutes pass  by and I get my hummus plate delivered to me. Then my friend meets me and goes up to order. She comes back and tells me that my chai with a shot of espresso had been made, and that she saw it sitting there on the counter getting cold (they have always delivered coffee to where the customer is sitting-- the way my hummus plate was delivered) and she heard the manager walk up to it, ask how long it had been there and then throw it out.  Then the girl at the counter told my friend they were out of chai so she came back to me and told me I had to order something different after I had already paid.  So we went back up to the counter, and my friend asked to clarify that they don't have any chai left, and the manager then said that they did! The girl at the counter just says, ""oh I thought we were out"". So my friend orders the same thing I did (a dirty chai with almond milk-- which almond milk, by the way, costs extra) and then the manager makes mine with almond milk and hers with regular milk! At that point we were so tired of coming up and getting confused that we just sat down, drank our tea, and left.  I don't know if this was a rare occurrence but it was absolutely ridiculous. I will not be returning.",0.8702,0.836,0.095,0.069,0.47614234056541743

After waiting 5 minutes in line (there were 2 people in front of me), the guy at the register proceeds to walk away as I step up to the counter. Doesn't say ""I'll be with you in a few minutes"" or even acknowledge I'm there. The 3 workers I saw there all seemed to work slowly and without urgency. 3 people behind me left because they couldn't wait that long, and I should've followed their lead. After standing there like I was invisible for 5 more minutes, he doesn't even apologize or say ""Thanks for waiting"" before asking what I want.  I knew it was a red flag there, but I was hungry so I still ordered food for my sister and myself. We proceed to sit outside, waiting at least 40 minutes for our food!!  After someone who sat down after us got a sandwich, I feared they had forgotten about our food. I walked up to the counter and asked if our food was coming and said that we had been waiting 40 min. The man asked for my name and said they were really behind. He checked with the cook in the back and said it'd be another 3 minutes.  We ended up waiting another 7+ minutes before our food finally came. The man apologized, saying they didn't expect the rush from the marathon, yet he said it as an excuse and without asking if we had everything we needed. Dude, there was NOT that many people there, plus they would've known about the marathon and could've prepared for any extra influx. Suffice to say, the meal was not worth a 50 minute wait. My breakfast bowl and my sister's veggie panini were mediocre. Could've made it better and cheaper ourselves. I asked for no sour cream on mine, which they remembered, but then they forgot to put the avocado on! So, an hour after arriving at this place, I get an incorrect, lackluster meal.

2016-06-04,2.0,"Pretty disappointed with my last visit.  Second time coming and I just don't see how I will ever go back in a city where there is an endless assortment of food options.  It seems like this place has become complacent.  I'm aware they have been around since 1993, but that does not give you the right to be meh and charge Lincoln Park prices and just keep on keepin on. I ordered the half sandwhich/half salad and was charged $14.75(ish).  It seemed high, so I asked the cashier as I paid.. I thought this was $11.75? To no fault of his own, he pointed me to the chalkboard where the updated price was listed. Apparently, the owner hasn't updated the menus.  Really LP cafe owner, I think you can afford to laminate 15 sheets of new menus. - Next, my sandwhich came out on very dried out bread and the salad edges were browned.  Very disappointing at any price.I am not one to send back food unless it is truly not edible, so I ate it, but not with much enjoyment and definitely without desire to ever come back. Snap out of it Bourgeois Pig Cafe owner!  Clean your darn bathroom, put some ice in the water pitchers, sell your day old bread and your sell full price paying customers fresh bread, staff the coffee side adequately, and don't hand out menus with outdated prices.  If you do these things, maybe I will come back one day.",-0.8656,0.826,0.067,0.107,0.4060807050092764
2016-06-04,1.0,My family normally loves the food here. However last week we ordered through grub hub. We ordered 3 sandwiches and only two arrived. I called to inform them of the issue and they started making my additional sandwich. The issue comes in where it took them an hour to deliver it! So my  family wasn't able to eat together. When I called to check on it 20 minutes after informing them they were apathetic about the situation. I asked for a manager to call me back... Which never happened. I received my final soggy panini an hour after their mistake. I called back after I recorded my soggy panini and the person told me that he would have a manager cal me back the next morning...

The one cashier had a lot of ""um's"" and wasn't sure of what was what. I ordered a spinach quiche and he told me I had to pick it up on the other side. Once on the other side, the ""barista"" said: ""I don't know why he told you that. We don't have a kitchen here.""  How about you just help me lady? Once I go back to the other side, the ""cook"" tells me: ""Yeah, I don't know why either"". At this point I'm like: wtf??

I have a few hours (I am currently sitting there) to kill and was looking for a relaxing coffeeshop that I could get some work done at and also do a working lunch. I googled ""best coffeeshops in Chicago"" and google helpfully suggested ""best coffeeshops in Chicago to do work""... tons of suggestions from different sources but this one came up in a couple. What was impressive was there were a lot of people reviewing coffeeshops from the standpoint of places to get stuff done. Very helpful! Wish all cities had this.. Anyway, I am currently here. The sandwich is EXCELLENT! I ordered the hobbit - very good ingredients, again a huge sandwich; all the ingredients worked well together.  Not sure about the coffee; not my fav in Chicago (I forget the kind they sell here). Loved the Intelligentsia coffee but I dont think this place sells that. It also got cold pretty soon; they insist that you take your own drink upstairs (if that is where you choose to sit). By the time you carry your stuff upstairs and settle down at a table, the coffee is cold. Dunno the way around this... Serve staff is very friendly but they only bring food up, not anything else. Wifi is good; found a nice table to work at. The overall atmosphere is OK esp if you want to get some serious stuff done (relatively quiet); if you are looking for a bit more hustle and bustle and people, no.",0.9968,0.702,0.257,0.042,0.6302592592592594

2015-08-31,2.0,"I would have liked to say that the endearing antiques and knick-knacks, menu items being named after famous literature, and the mostly smiley staff made our visit an enjoyable one. Unfortunately, our morning meal had issues that overshadowed all that is good--and there is much--about the Bourgeois Pig Café.  Firstly, while my small crew and I began to order and were asked if we'd like to seat ourselves inside or out, we took all of 30 seconds to decide, but this seemed to exasperate the cashier who raised her eyebrows and said tartly: ""that's ALL I needed to know."" Well. Ok.  Secondly, I was sprout-less. They may not seem a conundrum to the hoi polloi, but I had, in fact, had an exchange with my fellow vegetarian in which I decided to order a certain sandwich named after a certain Frances Hodgson Burnett masterpiece purely for the reason that it had been way too long since my last sprout fix. Upon receiving said sandwich, I politely pointed out that it had been delivered sans sprouts. The cashier/waitress (same as before), waved her hand dismissively: ""Oh, we haven't had sprouts in months,"" she scoffed. This somewhat amused me, but her attitude made my blood boil. Whatever the issue is, the first response should be: ""Oh, I'm sorry, I can offer [blank] to make it better."" But also, am I to believe that the handwritten menu on the chalkboard has been incorrect a month? If so, that's very careless. Or else, the cashier/server lied to me. Thirdly, when I attempted to procure a cup of water from the cooler, there were no cups. The cashier/server/cup fetcher (same as before) did go to the trouble to grab some disposable cups from the Bourgeois Pig coffee shop next store. I thanked her and tried to take the stack, so that I could put out the rest of the cups for future customers. She looked at me askance, with her eyebrows practically disappearing into her hairline: ""Uh... just take one."" Once again, it was the attitude that was the problem. If the stack wasn't for putting out, that's fine, but I would have appreciated not being looked at like an idiot. Perhaps she thought I was a cheap thief or hoarder who would make off with her extra cups. I'm not sure. But I thought my actions were rational, ESPECIALLY when my mate when for a cup of water, and there were no cups to be found. Seems my solution would have been a good one, but apparently it was too much logic for some people. In terms of taste, sprouts or no, I don't think I've ever had a more tasteless sandwich. My fellow vegetarian agreed, though she at least got all of her ingredients. We all agreed that the bread, though supposedly extra tasty, with whole grains and sundried tomatoes and the like, was much too thick and made the sandwich extra dry.  Overall, I will definitely try the B.P. again when in Chicago. Most of the staff members were effervescent and helpful, my side waffle was the bomb, and the atmosphere was very cute and begs to be photographed.

The restaurant is divided into two halves for the moment (something about building renovations?) and my friend and I started out on the left-hand side at the coffee bar.  The staircase up was closed off.  We both thought it was odd ambience - small space, not very many tables, some outlets not working, and staff kept going outside to get glassware.  I was thinking, are we in the right place?  Where are the warm and cozy rooms?  So we found out that we have to go outside, to the other ""half"" of the cafe. Ok, so we gathered our laptops and were ready to order food. Except that the food menu is on display on a chalkboard on the coffee-shop side. There were paper menus, but the didn't seem as detailed or up to date. We ordered tea and we had to physically bring the large glass bowls of tea leaves from the shelf on the side of the wall up to the counter (???).  There was no seating in this area, it was all upstairs. We finally made it to the upstairs where the cozy rooms are supposed to be.  There were 3 different rooms with different shapes and sizes of tables and a couch. The largest main room with a a big window overlooking Fullerton was packed so we ended up in the back room by the back door.  It was a tight squeeze and I felt a little weird that we might be disturbing others sitting so close by that looked to be deeply working, but whatever, it was the only spot left.   The staff brought our food upstairs, and yes, the food was good.  I had a spinach quiche with a side of fruit, my friend has a wrap, and we shared a giant cookie.  It was all solid, but not mind-blowing.  My friend and I left scratching our heads.",0.9581,0.871,0.094,0.035,0.4194361944361945

2015-02-20,4.0,"I came here on a crowded Sunday afternoon with 6+ people and used my Indie Coffee Passport for a free coffee.  They marked my passport with a pig-shaped stamp.  Their windowpane had lettering that read: ""antiquarian cafe.""  This place is nothing short of adorable.  The Bourgeois Pig Cafe is a beloved Lincoln Park favorite.  Plus the name is so fun to say. There are two parts to the establishment. When you walk up the stairs, sandwiches on the LEFT, coffee/drinks on the RIGHT.  But if you order food and decide to sit upstairs on the right-side, the servers will happily bring your sandwich to you (as I observed).  Sweet. I was very tempted to give this place three stars because really, the space does not accommodate large groups.  They do have a ""designated"" section for group meetings and a sign that tells you to limit your meeting to 60 minutes.  But my goodness, the room is the size of a small pantry. However, I appreciated the uniqueness of Bourgeois Pig and didn't want its lack of space to impact the 4-star rating.  The truth is, if I were to ever come either alone, with 2-3 others MAX and/or attend Depaul in another lifetime, I would be in LOVE with this place.  If I were a college student I think I would spend an unhealthy amount of time here nestled on a claw-footed chair. The interior is so fun and it feels like a vintage shop just happened to turn itself into a cafe.  If you've ever been to the New Elephant Resale Shop of Chicago, just south of Depaul's campus on 1145 Webster, you might know what I mean.  They have vintage Coke signs in French tacked onto their doorways, an extensive selection of teas in a floor-to-ceiling wooden cabinet and just a whirlwind of things to look at and admire (or question).... like in a thrift shop. This cafe has been the one with the most ""character"" so far on the Indie Coffee Passport but then again I still have a lot more cafes to explore in the city.  Happy caffeination!

The café is split into 2 sections; one for drinks and one for sandwiches, although you can sit on either side. On the coffee side, there's usually only one barista and one cashier, and a line of customers. This means there's a bit of a wait and because the section is small you have to stand around awkwardly waiting for your drink and pretending to be interested in the jars of tea they have on display.

Fine; that's their business model.  But this was just me and I didn't want two sandwiches.   I opted to add an additional half portion of meat (95 cents) to my $9.75 Catcher in the Rye sandwich.  That's a Reuben with tomatoes and lettuce, by the way.  A Reuben, which has corned beef.  The option to add meat is specific to each sandwich on their online menu.  The reason that I mention this will be clear very soon. I got my sandwich and opened it to find that the initial, really skimpy portion of meat (which, believe me, was insufficient for the sandwich) was supplemented by a slice of turkey.  What?  My Reuben sandwich, my corned beef with sauerkraut and swiss and Russian dressing had a slice of turkey on it?  But why? So I ate my sandwich -- after all, the delivery guy had already left and it wasn't his issue -- he's not with the restaurant.  They use a delivery service.  But I did send an e-mail to the restaurant politely asking for an explanation for the turkey meat on my sandwich.  I never got a response.  (This was more than a week ago now -- plenty of time for them to have answered me.) I guess I won't bother ordering from the Bourgeois Pig again.  Or going there, either.  So sad.",0.5557,0.897,0.056,0.047,0.359589947089947

We stayed just long enough to drink some coffee and use the bathroom and sit for fifteen minutes enjoying a spot of nice weather. Both the little cafe and the outdoor patio were cute and pleasant. No problems with service. There were people on the patio, but no one in line when we ordered. I had a tasty iced coffee and had a good time relaxing outside. There was some kind of student at a nearby table with a laptop and a copy of Infinite Jest laid out in front of him. I'm guessing he was settled in pretty good. Our stay was short and sweet.

Honestly - would it kill you to smile? Plus it takes about 20 minutes+ to get two sandwiches. Not great if you want a quick bite. Perhaps if the staff waited until after we got our lunch to hand roll a cigarette and smoke it out back - we would have been in and out of there more quickly.  2) The food is just okay.

2014-05-30,4.0,"A gem, the Bourgeois Pig, is quite a unique spot for those college students around the corner, wanderers on their way to Lincoln Park zoo or Oz Park, and for the frequent native. The thing that makes this place so special is quite evident even prior to walking through the front gates; a welcoming outdoor patio, and a steel Eiffel Tower with the name of the restaurant entices one to pause. Instantly, you know this will not be your quick one- time-stop for an average brunch.   Vintage decor and quirky accessories culminates the atmosphere to transform it into a homey yet museum-like space. The division of the two upstairs seating provides the customer lots of options. If you want more of a hip, loud interaction, choose the left entrance, on the main floor. Too busy? Try upstairs to find a room with a fireplace, books, historic photographs, and velvet red love sofas and chairs. A great Victorian vibe, with the added French music lingering in the background is the perfect touch for the romantic at heart. Still not your vibe? Try the next entrance on the right side. Here, choose to order your favorite homemade sweets to some of the most amazing loose leaf teas I have ever tasted! Not much seating here, but plenty of space upstairs. As a frequent visitor, I have found that this area is predominantly the quieter niche- you'll find writers with their laptops, students discussing a project, or someone happily reading a book. Is it a nice day out? Savor those few blissful summer months in Chicago and try outdoors, with equally quaint and lovely seating.  Ah, the menu. The selection of sandwiches has a poetic jeer as well, with names such as Hamlet, Walt Whitman, and The Great Gatsby to choose from, what can be better? For a lover of literature, art, or history, it is a charming touch sure to put a smile on one's face. I would give this gem a full 5 stars if there were a few more options for vegetarians & vegans, however, the Veggie Panini is delicious, and not the average dried out vegetable medley I find too often in other cafes. The pesto+ artichoke combo is delightful!  In a nutshell, the Bourgeois Pig Cafe is a perfect blend of the new+ old, of quiet + loud, and of an abundance of options. For the curious minded hopeless romantic, or one who enjoys quirky odds and ends, this spot is memorable because it engulfs an experience- of one to return back in time, even for a quick bite to eat.",0.9982,0.784,0.204,0.012,0.5346356883856884

Since then, I have spent many Sunday mornings grading essays, planning lessons, reading the newspaper or a good book, and caffeinating my way to early hypertension (though the poor student essays might have something to do with that as well). ""The Pig"" has a delicious selection of coffee and drinks that are made well, though at times can be inconsistent (given the barista on shift). The food is really what makes this place great and differentiates it from the other local coffee shops in the city. Sandwiches are named after acclaimed novels, which will will warm the heart--and the belly--of any English major. Try ""The Catcher in the Rye"" if you're in the mood for a decent corned beef sandwich inspired by the novel's protagonist. My personal favorite is ""The Sun Also Rises,"" which is both delectable and a fitting homage to my personal favorite, Hemingway. While ""the Pig"" has great food and drink, it is often crowded, noisy, and busy. It is best frequented on an early Saturday or Sunday morning or in the late evening hours.

The aim is really not to be nostalgic over some good old days, but to add some perspective as a relatively regular customer. I am a grad student at DePaul, and considering the lack of decent food around lincoln park,  i liked this place enough to keep me going there few times a week. it was very convenient to go there to have a sandwich or a salad and work. However, this is not the case anymore. First of all, it got way more expensive over the past few years. A sandwich and a soda for 12-15 bucks? Really? Moreover, not only did the prices go up, but the food actually got worse. Let's be clear, their sandwiches were always decent; these were never 'amazing' or 'gourmet' sandwiches. What happened is that they started skipping some ingredients and/or changing the quality of ingredients. They also started using the microwave much more (microwaving pre-cooked chicken breasts over their salads and telling this as if it is perfectly normal became a thing, for example.) So, decreased food quality and increased prices. Needless to say, not a good combo.  Lastly, for god's sake, please 'try' to clean those toilets once in a while! They are absolutely disgusting! The sink is practically black an there were period blood stains on the toilet seat. Have some decency to your business, you can't charge people more for worse food and make them use absolutely disgusting rest rooms in the meantime.

My friend got it without meat and loved it too, so we convinced our friend to just meet up with us and eat there too.  After getting our food we went and picked up our coffee next door.

2014-04-18,3.0,"About a 2.5: The Bourgeois Pig Cafe is a DePaul student favorite, as it is literally across the campus.  They offer sandwiches, paninis, salads, muffins, bagels, danishes, and beverages.  I had the combination platter that comes with your choice of 1/2 of their 'sammies' and a quiche or a soup.  Your 'choice' of a sammy is from about 5-6 of the different arrays of sandwiches they offer.  I went along with the 'I Am the Cheese' sandwich, which was a basil pesto smeared on tomatoes, red onions, and brie, cheddar and dill havarti cheeses on a multigrain bread.  The three cheese itself were melted, and the basil pesto was a bit too strong for my taste.  I wasn't a fan of their bread as it didn't taste fresh.  I opted for the quiche - a goat cheese and artichoke, in which the goat cheese was not at all melted completely in the quiche; artichokes were very scarce, and the crust was not tasty at all.  The quiche comes with a side of fruit, which were cantaloupes and strawberries. My husband had the Turkey Panini, which was focacia bread with two slices of shaved turkey breast, muenster cheese, mushrooms, tomatoes, red onions, basil and basil vinaigrette.   The turkey itself was very unflavorful, and even though it was a panini, the sandwich itself was very wet and soggy. The cafe itself seemed very cute with the wood work and the rustic feel.

The internet is such a hassle and extremely inconvenient.  You can order a coffee and a sandwich, scramble for a seat upstairs, and get settled.  When you realize you need the internet, you have to have someone watch your stuff, go downstairs to get a password, and bring down your half-eaten sandwich as proof that you bought something in order to get the password.  You get work done, order another coffee and a sandwich, and then realize the internet expired.  Now what? I hate this method.  Instead of assuming that their customers are normal people who have been living in society and make a purchase when entering an establishment (like Starbucks, for example), they make all of their honest customers jump through these hoops.

One was definitely half a sandwich.  But everything was charged as a full sandwich. I guess my biggest qualm now is how some of the kids working there are just rude.  I have a ceramic travel coffee mug with a starbucks logo that I drink water out of when I'm out and about.  I came in to order lunch and the boy behind the counter looked at my mug, looked me up and down, gave me the stink eye, and said ""Really?  You're going to bring THAT in there?""

I have a feeling that they're having trouble in the kitchen, and I hope for their own sake that they get it resolved soon. Judging by the amount of negative reviews as of late, I'm not the only want that has felt a little hung out to dry by their service. I ordered the Sun Also Rises sandwich. Took 35 minutes. It's a turkey sandwich. How can it take 35 min? No sprouts or tomatoes were served on it, no warning that they were out of those ingredients. Pathetic amount of turkey. I've had this sandwich no less than 10 times. And the amount of turkey was laughable. All the meat was pushed up front too, in an attempt to make it look adequate. I would have mentioned it to the server, but she was arguing with my girlfriend about her house salad that was missing several ingredients without warning as well.  The service matched the food. The cashier was argumentative, refused to apologize or hardly even acknowledge their mistakes. I understand that it's more than likely the kitchen's fault, but damn don't get mad at us when we tell you that we didn't get what we paid for.",-0.993,0.705,0.062,0.233,0.5995614035087719

My boyfriend and I visited today around 4pm, ordered a salad and sandwich and waited 35 minutes for it. We ordered the apply crisp, received the apple dumpling. My salad was not what I expected. The description listed alfalfa sprouts, portabello  mushrooms, blue cheese...etc. What I actually got was a bed of romaine with a piece of boiled chicken in top. I questioned the cashier who took my order and she immediately became defensive and assertive insisting that was what I had asked for.The situation escalated so much so that I walked inside and read her the description of the salad out loud. she replied ""well were out of it"" BUT then she literally yelled at the cook if front of customers and other staff. I was embarrassed that my sorry looking salad had came to this. I have worked in the food industry and Ive been there. However, I was appalled at her lack of professionalism  and argumentative approach. I was taught that the customer is ALWAYS right, even when they are wrong. It would have been just as easy for her to remain calm, address my concerns, and not scold her co-worker like a dog.

Not only are the people great, the food and coffee are delicious!  I am a creature of habit so I've only had the espresso and americano but both are brewed perfectly and the coffee quality is fantastic.  They also have a ridiculous selection of handpicked teas.   I've had the baked goods, which are succulent, and a couple of the sandwiches.  The turkey panini on Focaccia is amazing, and the Opera House (i think that's what it was called) was also fabulous.  The turkey panini was hot, the meat was delicious (boar's head) the vegetables fresh, and the cheese was perfectly melted.  The opera house has fresh spinach and grilled chicken with basil pesto.  Both are mouthwatering just thinking about.   They also serve breakfast ALL DAY.  The baked goods are made in house, and whoever is in charge has it down to a science.  The scones are incredible and pair with the coffee perfectly.   Back to the atmosphere:  The coffee shop is in an old house and has great study room upstairs and the restaurant next door offers seating upstairs and has a rooftop as well.  The vibe is very vintage and has an 50's feel to it.  Very calming and pleasant.    You will not be disappointed, if you are, you are just an angry person.",0.9985,0.722,0.244,0.034,0.6549707602339181

The menu on the board was challenging to read, but I found what I wanted and placed my order with the manager. I also picked up a bottle of iced tea and an oversized cookie, which was all I ended up consuming there. 10 minutes or so after I ordered, the manager came bounding up the stairs screaming my name. I raised my hand, and over she came, but not before reaching over 3 other tables with people studying to hand me my food. Which wasn't what I ordered. Before I could object, she was long gone. After returning downstairs and being told that I had, in fact, ordered turkey, even though I have been vegetarian for 8 years, the manager said that they would fix the order and told the staff. Immediately following, she informed me that she would be eating the turkey sandwich I had just had in front of me. I laughed at her bluntness and informed her that I had, in fact, taken a bite out of the pickle. She looked me up and down before saying, ""eh, you look clean enough."" An hour and a half I was there, twice I reminded the manager I didn't get my food, and it never came. Both times, she put on a fake shocked expression and told me she would take care of it. When I went down to ask for my money back and complain, she apologized in a back-handed way and said she ""had other things to do"" instead of worry about my order. I told her I understand mistakes happen in restaurants, but she made no effort to fix anything. I sincerely hope that someone who owns the cafe reads this, because I genuinely wanted to like the place.

Seating:  All of the seating is basically taken up by a all of the people hanging around on their computers who had ordered a coffee or tea and take the next 2 hrs sipping it.  How about you be considerate and move for the next paying customer. Food: Bags of chips are all stacked in a wood barrel so you have to dig through to find the ones you want. Ordered a chocolate shake, the cashier failed to tell us that you have to walk next door to get it.  So our food ends up coming 30 minutes after we ordered it without the shake.  When we asked about the shake, the waitress tells us that we have to walk next door.  Wouldn't you think they would tell you that when you order.  Ends up the shake had been sitting there for 25 minutes and was basically chocolate milk.  Ordered two sandwiches, there was only 1 slice of meat on each.  For the price you pay for the food, the sandwich should be piled high.  There's a note on the menu that say they use Boar's head meat because they don't compromise with lower quality meat due to high price.  Giving one slice of meat is most definitely a compromise.  To top it all off, sadly the food just wasn't that good, lacked flavor.

Over the five years I've lived in Chicago, I've had my share of BP lovin'. They've been consistently reliable in terms of their coffee/espresso drinks, sandwiches, and pastries. Their gastronomical refinement is actually quite subtle. Every time I peruse around the cash register on the beverages side (the cafe is split between two sides: food on the left, beverages on the right), I find little delicious things all worthy of immediate consumption... lavender shortbread, sea salt caramels, huge chocolate chip cookies, artisan scones. I personally like their sandwiches -- especially the Sun Also Rises. (Apparently listed as one of the best in Chicago!).  There's a genuine European feel to the cafe that I adore: rustic provincial wooden furniture, dimly-lit chandeliers, detailed and glossed wallpaper, French sinks (in the bathroom, that is), stained glass, the old creaky front doors... There is always jazz, French ""gypsy,"" and classic vocal music playing. I'm always diggin' the Tony Bennett, Diana Krall, Gershwin, Cole Porter, and Django Reinhardt piped throughout the joint. I mean, I like my indie music too but I also appreciate the throwbacks! Here is why BP is one of my favorite cafes/coffee shops in Chicago: They ALL know how to do a PROPER Americano. Many places mess up this coffeehouse mainstay beverage by watering down the drink and putting a small handful of ice (which melts quickly watering the drink down further). Each time I visit a coffeehouse, I like to see how they prepare their *iced* Americanos. On visit #2 of a coffeehouse, I have to be more specific when I know the first time was watered down... ""less water, extra ice."" Each BP barista I've said ""Iced Americano. Less water, extra ice please"" to, they've all said ""As it should be!"" THANK YOU! I'm so glad I'm not alone on this. I've had a few cheeky chats with the baristas at BP and they all agree that that's the proper way to do an iced Americano. It's not coffee snobbery, it's about quality and maximizing flavor. I feel that iced Americanos need to be concentrated and not tasting like dirty water. Accordingly, I can go to BP each time not having to ""explain myself"" unlike many coffeeshops elsewhere.  BP also has a frequent beverage card so make sure you stamp it each time. They have free wifi with purchase (up to 2 hours of procrastination... I mean, internet!). Lastly, the good thing about this place is that... yes, there are folks comfortably working away on their laptops... but there are many other tables just ENJOYING life -- dates (I've seen many firsts here! -- gay and straight!), friends catching-up, playwrights talking about their future projects, Second City actors sipping lattes and being witty...

I called, and although the manager was nice about it, he seemed to totally miss the point on the corn syrup, and doesn't seem to want to make a change.

Also, there hasn't been indie music played in the place for over 3 months.  It is ALWAYS jazz and soul, the same song in every room.  I personally watched the owner hook up the entire thing, constant satellite jazz/French coffee shop station. Also, why are you complaining about a restaurant having a full house?  I'd have to say, for me, that means they're doing something right.  The food is good, the coffee is good.  Sometimes coffee gets cold when you add milk, so I think that people should keep that in mind. The staff I don't think are out to be rude to anyone.  From what I've witnessed, the only times I've seen staff acting short or uninterested in continuing interaction with a customer is if the customer is being rude to them first.  They aren't being paid to put up with your crap.   Oh yeah and they DO recycle.  There are 3 recycling bins under the bus tubs by the water dispenser.  Open your eyes.

Everyone is on their MacBook or ""philosophizing"" loudly with each other about naive bullshit. Right now at the table next to me, two ironically dressed hipsters (they're such individuals!) chat about the ""Puerto Rican gangs that rule Humboldt Park"". How it's dangerous to leave the sanctity of Wicker Park at night. Somehow, hipsters complaining about being terrified to leave their re-gentrified safe-haven was amusing, but also a bit xenophobic? Enough about hipsters and the bad indie music ""the pig"" plays loudly (my god, does it ever stop!!). This place pisses me off. First off, it's constantly packed. Rain, snow, weekdays, whenever, it's wall to wall people. One time, I couldn't even get in the door it was so packed! What I mean is that it was so full, people were literally in the door frame because all other areas were filled with human flesh. So 90% of the time I go empty-handed, I have to just leave because it's too ridiculous. When I DO get in (sounds like I try a lot, but I could count on one hand the number of times I've actually been inside), I expect a lot. It's like, hey there are a lot of business that I really like and I want to succeed; what makes you so special? Two: the drinks are overpriced. On top of that, I couldn't pay with a card and the staff was really rude and unfriendly about it. It's the 21st century; how am I the bad guy by trying to pay with a debit card?

I call to let them know, the guy was very apologetic, I understand this happens, no problem at all i tell him. He says the new order will be there in 20 minutes and to keep the food we have (I offered to give it back). 20 minutes later I get a call from someone else. A girl who explains that they mixed up our order with our neighbors (building next door she means, not apartment neighbors). She asks if we would mind exchanging with them?! I said, no I do not want to do that. We've had the food for 20 minutes, I have no idea what they've done. I assume that like me, they lifted up the bread, inspected it to make sure it was not their order. She was surprised by this response. 40 minutes after that (now an hour from the ""we'll have your CORRECT order in 20 minutes quote). I call back and am told the delivery guy is out, so I should have the food within 20 MORE minutes. Starting to get pissed at this point. 30 minutes after that I call back and ask for a manger, apparently there was none that day (sunday?). The guy didn't know the food hadn't arrived yet, because as he explained to me, they use a 3rd party delivery service so they have no idea. He said he could try to get a hold of him through this company, which I said probably should have been done an hour ago!! So basically, there's no way for him to know that food did not arrive until someone calls and complains. Even if they've already called SEVERAL TIMES. He offered ""a gift card or something"" (not saying anything about how to receive/redeem this), but I explained I did not want anything, just my food. It was past 2:00 at this point! Finally the food arrives and SUCKS. I admit that I was not in an enthusiastic mind set at this point, but still, it sucked. I was lucky enough to have another sandwich for lunch today from the mix up, but unfortunately this sandwich also sucked and had a giant hair in it.

Apparently, the sandwiches are good, and if I ever order from there again I'll try one. I am vegan, though, so my options are quite limited. I have to say, I was extremely disappointed with my House salad which is described on the menu as romaine lettuce topped with tomato, red onion, portobello mushrooms, cucumbers, and sprouts. First of all, the salad was very small and comparable to a side dinner salad that one would get as part of a dinner meal. Second of all, the salad was missing sprouts and cucumbers. There were roughly 2 tiny specs of mushrooms and 2 slivers of tomato. Did I mention this salad is going for $6.99?",-0.5975,0.919,0.022,0.059,0.32461904761904764

2012-08-23,4.0,"I can't believe I never went here when I lived on campus at DePaul... I feel like I missed out. I've been here twice now, and the second experience was slightly better than the first, but both were quite good! A couple kind of weird things that I feel I should get out of the way first: 1) If you order a special drink, you have to leave the food side, go outside, and enter the side of the building where they make and sell the drinks in order to retrieve your drink. I did this both times, and both times the guy working on the other side asked me what drink I ordered. I don't know if the communication isn't great between the two sides or the guy was just confirming my drink order. A little strange, but not horribly inconvenient. And the drinks were good. The first time I had an Italian soda (though I can't remember what the flavor was), and the second time I had a ""scooby shake,"" a peanut buttery shake. Both were good, but I thought I should mention that little quirk. 2) You can get a hand-held menu, but I'd suggest reading the one on the wall, because it seems to be more accurate. Both times I visited, I had the East of Eden sandwich... But the first time, I only looked at the hand-held menu, which listed the ingredients as basil hummus, olives, avocado, tomatoes, swiss cheese, leaf spinach, and alfalfa sprouts on sundried tomato bread... Sounded right up my alley, but when I got my sandwich, it had mushrooms on it. I'm not incredibly picky, but there are two things that I know I absolutely do not like, and those are mushrooms and pickles. Luckily, mushrooms don't leak everywhere like pickles do, so I just picked them out and it wasn't a big deal. I also noticed that my sandwich didn't have sprouts on it, which was slightly disappointing, but not the end of the world. It was also a little strange because my friend, who ordered the same sandwich, got sprouts on hers. Hmmm... The second time I visited, I checked the hand-held menu to see if I had missed something, and mushrooms weren't listed... but when I looked on the wall, there they were (didn't notice if sprouts were listed or not though, hmm). So my only suggestion to this place would be to update their menus (the one on the website seems to be outdated, too)! This seems like a lot of complaining for a four-star review. I guess that's because the food is worth it. Everything is fresh and delicious. Both times I've sat upstairs, and once on the couches in the nice bright room with the fireplace. There's also, curiously, an old-fashioned phone booth and when you go in the bathroom you sort of feel like you're in someone's house... or at least, I did. TL;DR - Cool place with a nice vibe and good food, just make sure you double-check the ingredients of whatever you're ordering to make sure you're getting what you want to get.",0.9966,0.799,0.157,0.044,0.5248677248677249

2012-01-27,3.0,"3 years ago I would have given this place 5 stars.  Now?  It gets 3 for the following reason: THE BOURGEOIS PIG IS NOT A PUBLIC LIBRARY!!! I tripped over multiple computer cords that were strung across the room.  Wifi hobos were sitting solo at pretty much ever single table.  I understand that it's a lovely studying environment, but the various students have turned it into an incredibly crowded and freaking loud study lounge.  I was a paying customer (I got the chicken parm panini, which was FAB), and I just wanted to sit with my boyfriend and have a nice warm afternoon lunch.  I went upstairs to find a table and every single available space was taken up by a macbook and a coed, of which none had a single BP product at her seat.  I found this incredibly insulting, as this is a great business with wonderful food and drink.  This isn't just some Starbucks where you can squat for hours and people will just have to find another Starbucks if they want a seat. When I used to live in LP, this place hadn't caught on as much as a Study Central, so it was possible to sit and drink some tea and enjoy good company.  Now it's so loud that you can't help but overhear some law students' thoughts on their recent group project,  or as happened the last time I was there,  a particularly cringe-worthy interview between some liberal arts major and the DePaul theatre school's admissions counselor.  You can't relax there anymore. I understand that the wifi is paid and BP is making their bones, but it's really really uncomfortable to walk into a place and think you're just interrupting everyone's studies when all you want is a sandwich.  It certainly didn't give me any incentive to go back. Also: when they remodeled they took away the wall of loose tea, which I understand, but I miss being able to take my pick from the wall.  That's just a nitpick, as they still have the variety, you just don't have to bring the jar to them anymore. Overall, this place has great food, great atmosphere, and it's at a great location, but unless you are a DePaul student, or if you have a lot of feelings about Plato's Republic, I'd stay away.",0.9839,0.802,0.133,0.065,0.5224405935944398
2012-01-22,2.0,"OVERALL EXPERIENCE: BAD. Now we may have simply gotten unlucky in our timing, but we had a fairly terrible experience at Bourgeois Pig Cafe yesterday.  We arrived around noon.  The place seemed fairly full, but I knew that there were multiple rooms in the joint and that some seating would probably open up by the time our food was ready. We ordered.  About 20 seconds after ordering, one of the other order takers starts telling everyone ordering that there is simply no seating and it'd have to be to go.  This worried me because our order taker had failed to mention this prior to our ordering our food.  No worries, I was sure something would open up.  There were a couple of problems with this assumption.  First, there are multiple rooms and there are a steady flow of people that snag tables first and then order, regardless of how long others have been waiting for a seat.  They need a system for this.  Two people cannot ""guard"" four different seating rooms waiting for a table to open up, nor should they have to.  Second, people apparently camp here.  Literally.  No joke, there was at least one person fully passed out all over a table for four upstairs.  I tried waking him even by making some noise next to him in an unsubtle manner, to no avail.  The staff probably could have woke him up and opened the table up.  Third, while we waited, the bench in the main waiting area shattered with someone sitting on it.  He was fine, but my hopes of even grabbing a bench seat shattered with his plunge to the ground.  There was no longer any seating for us.  Then our food came out.  We again walked around all the rooms to find no seats and asked for our food to go. Transferring the coffee to the to go container made me realize how little coffee you get in their mugs.  It's roughly $2.05 for a small coffee, which comes our to at most 8 oz.  Now maybe it's a free refill if you dine in, but it just seemed a little nickle and dime, or perhaps I was just bitter after having to go beg to get my coffee transferred into a container I could carry out into the snow with my ever cooling food. In their defense: there was apparently a baby shower.  They were incredibly busy.  One staff member was VERY apologetic and seemed sincere.  This was appreciated.  The food, even by the time we walked all the way home, was still pretty decent lukewarm.   BUT, they certainly could have done more.  For example, the person taking our order could have filled us in about the whole no seating situation PRIOR to us ordering.  This would have saved us the stress of hovering, shamelessly trying to wake up the passed out dude, and trying to snag a seat.  We also could have decided to go elsewhere.  They could have also given us something to actually show some remorse.  Or, even better, they could actually have a semblance of a seating plan, such as forcing people to actually order BEFORE they can sit.  This would help turnover a lot. PRICE: High for what it is. We got a drip coffee, a soup/sandwich, a full sandwich, and a latte for $26.  That puts it at $$, not $ as advertised on yelp.  It's only under $10 if you just get a sandwich and a water, which I suspect nobody actually does.  Considering that it's deli meat and some veggies requiring about 5 minutes of prep, I think it's a little steep. FOOD:  Pretty good, but not rave worthy.  There are MANY other places pumping out better sandwiches at comparable prices, such as Panes.  I had the sun also rises, dining partner had pilgrim's progress and cream of tomato soup.  I personally thought the sun also rises was a little bland.  Their hummus is okay, but honestly all you people can make better, more flavorful hummus at home.  It was pretty devoid of seasoning.  Their coffee was the standout; even the drip was thoroughly enjoyed. I'll be back and hopefully I can bump them up some stars after a positive experience.  Until then, I'll remember this place as that overly crowded antique deli where that guy fell through the bench and we had to walk out with our overpriced food into the snow place.",0.9788,0.804,0.112,0.084,0.4523253208779527

The whole time I was there I felt like I could have been in Harry Potter or I could have written Harry Potter, too bad it had already been done. Thanks a lot JK Rowling.  This place had a very old European feel to it. The weird decor, the old mis matching furniture, the telephone booth (yes there was one), among many other random things made the upstairs very unique. I do hope, however, that they utilize their space better because I struggled to find a place to sit for a good 5 minutes.  More on the logistic, the place is actually 2 buildings combined. They are not linked whatsoever, so you have to exit one to enter another. If you're there for coffee, and strictly coffee, its the door on the right. Deli and sandwiches, please enter on the left (I told you, this is where magic happens). Both buildings have upstairs seating and some tables and chair downstairs.  Coffee was good - $2.75 for a medium, and they asked for a $3 min for credit card (maybe it was just because I was ordering it on the Deli side - rookie mistake). So I grabbed a pecan shortbread to go with it. I then had to walk over to the other side and pick up my coffee, kinda annoying, but now I've learned my lesson. I think you can bring your own mug, and they'd give you a discount - not sure but I'll try it soon. They also had tons of sandwiches ranging from 8-10 bucks, a bit pricey I think, but I didn't try any, so so comment there.  The name itself confused me.

It's just much more entertaining to work in a nice atmosphere than on the couch.) The menu was ginormous, I counted 5 blackboards filled w/tiny print. The food portions were huge (my half quiche half sandwich looked like full sandwich and full quiche), and it was pretty good too (not ridiculously amazing or anything, but good).  There were 3 problems that kept this from being a 5.  1) The first was the pain in the buttness of having to order and take food from one area, but pick up my coffee from next door. ( Apparently the rented next door area cannot be torn to just make this whole thing one space.  To their credit, they will bring it to your table if you feel like waiting) 2) They were out of chocolate for mochas!! That's not ok for a cafe. They have all these things to choose from, and they're out of the most important part of most espresso drinks? At least they had plenty of other choices. 3) Their internet was 2 hr limit. I obviously get why, but at this point, most cafes are unlimited, so you're behind the pack if you don't.

It took my friend and I about ten minutes to order because it's hard as hell to decide. We split the creamy tomato bisque and holy Jesus, it's the best tomato bisque I've had, EVER. The Sun Also Rises (which is a great book, btw) was delicious....kind of wish I had gotten a whole sandwich instead of half. I cannot wait to come back here, and bring everyone I know here. I almost feel silly giving it five stars when I've only been here once but trust me, it was that good.

It was expensive but one of the better sandwiches I have had in quite some time. in fact, it was crazy delicious and absolutely huge. Two meals easy. I wanted coffee with it but in order to get it I had to go out one door and into the ""bakery"" type section. They don't bring it to you. I also saw some salads that come out and looked very good. The service was really good that day. The next visit was for breakfast so I went to the other side. I wanted a muffin but the only one they had that were not day old's were a buttermilk raspberry. Seemed odd to me that there were so few to choose from in the morning! The muffin was very moist but I didn't care for it at all. The latte I got sort of grew on me as time went on, but wasn't unforgettable. The brownies looked amazing but I didn't want one for breakfast. And I thought the service was fine but not great. So not that impressed overall. I say if you want a sandwich, get on over there -- I'd make a special trip for that BLT. If not, I'd head elsewhere for a latte.

2011-08-01,3.0,"The gist of this review is this: don't go here if you need to study.  Go here if you're trying to act as if you're studying. As I see it, there are a handful of cafe categories. For example, you've got your study cafes (Noble Tree), socializing cafes (Filter), pretentious cafes (Intelligentsia and Cafe Neo), and utilitarian cafes (Starbucks).   Beourgeois Pig is a socializing cafe masquerading as a study cafe.  You go there thinking you'll get some work done, but after about 10 minutes, you'll likely end up surrendering to the overwhelming amount of chatter.  The combination of generous fire-code people-capacity limits and undergrads on talkative study dates makes things especially tough on concentration. On the up-side they've got a decent porch and the feel of an 19th century French bookstore.  On the down-side they've got no wifi (as of summer 2011) and you're guaranteed to bump elbows with patrons just about anywhere you sit.",0.1181,0.94,0.028,0.032,0.6833333333333333

Sometimes it's hard to find a seat or a power outlet, and it's often too loud to study. Upstairs is usually pretty quiet, but one loud conversation can ruin everything.

I ordered 2 cappuccinos, 1 espresso, and 3 pan au chocolate (a.k.a. chocolate croissant) - my mom wanted a plain butter croissant but they didn't have any. Turns out that the croissant were stale and they were probably from the day before. While we were ""enjoying"" our breakfast outside, a van stopped in front of the place and a guy started to unload any kind of baked goods from it (I assume that among those things there were also the fresh croissants I was hoping to have). After we finished, I went inside to return the cups and I told my server that the croissant were stale and he goes: ""that's strange, maybe it's the humidity.""  Well, the croissants were undoubtedly stale, since they were delivering the fresh ones while I was eating them, and I think it was unacceptable that I wasn't informed of that in advance.

I can't say that I'll stop coming here because of the slow service, but it is certainly something that I take into consideration when budgeting my time for lunch.  It's by no means not a get-in, get-out type place.  If you have an hour or more, take some time and get a nice seat inside (upstairs is most cozy) or outside on their frequently sunny patio.",0.9825,0.84,0.122,0.038,0.4526289682539683

We went upstairs and sat at the table to wait for our food, and mine came in a decent time frame (about 10 minutes), but we waited for about 30 minutes and my friend's food still had not come. She waited five more minutes and went downstairs and the guy at the counter told her that they had lost her ticket, but ""things like that usually don't happen."" He was pretty unapologetic, and never actually apologized, he just tried to explain that losing tickets was a rare occurrence and told her that her food would be out shortly. There was a concert going on at school that night and we had gone to the Pig an hour before, thinking we would have more than enough time to eat and walk back before the concert started. After another 15 minutes her food was finally brought up to her, and ultimately she was late to the concert, her soup was missing from her order, and we didn't even get to eat together because she had to take hers to go.

So I moved downstairs to the more well-lit, but much *much* noisier atmosphere.  Seriously.  I had headphones in turned up pretty loud and I could hear both the radio (barista's mix, I'm guessing) and the conversation of two people that must have been screaming at each other.  I don't expect silence, it's not a library, but, maybe they could invest in some lamps for upstairs?  Pretty please?  When sandwiches cost 8 bucks and large lattes cost 5 bucks, lamps hardly seem like a big investment.

2009-08-10,1.0,"The Bourgeois Pig is, I have concluded, one of those places that exists to serve the local hipsters and, more often than not, irritating yuppies who want to experience an alternative coffeeshop.  Well, let the yuppies have it, since the work ethic of this place reflects all that yuppies stand for: inauthenticity and poor service. The bf and I stopped in one afternoon because we needed directions to get somewhere (this is the story of my life) and I remember that the BP had wireless.  So why not make it a coffee-and-internet date so we could relax and figure how to get where we were going? I don't care that this place has cozy, humanities-professor's-office type decor or even that the food is made and baked fresh everyday.  Man, even Starbucks is better than the Bourgeois Pig Cafe.  I had to wait 15-20 minutes for a staff of three people, yes, three people, to get their act together and figure out who was taking orders and who was filling them and who was getting the money for them.  It was absolutely not that crowded, and I think I'm a fair judge given my own barista days in a busy coffeehouse. Ok, fine.  15 minutes to get my order taken.  Then another 10 to get my boyfriend's americano and my chocolate ice cream.  And they had no sprinkles, no toppings whatsoever.  Ok, I could deal.  But I couldn't deal with the fact that the ice cream was obviously old.  Yes, old, with those little water crystals and chewy bits it gets when it's been in the freezer for too long.  You know what I mean? Edible, but not delicious.  Not even tasty.  Well, that was a wasted $5. Worse, I sat down with D. and found he didn't like his coffee.  Then we learned that we had to pay for the wi-fi here.  Yeah, pay for it.  Seriously?  At a manically busy Lincoln Park establishment like this?  Ohhh, wait, it's Lincoln Park, and it's the Bourgeois Pig, a fake hipster independent coffeehouse that rips customers off with bad food, bad coffee, and pay-for-it wireless just so you can sit in an interior with red-painted walls and cheesy dark wood furniture.  I suppose I've been spoiled, but give me a break.  There are plenty, plenty of coffeeshops in Chicago with free wireless, and if it's not free, at least the place has good coffee or good ice cream or a good atmosphere.  I am never ever coming back here.

I ordered an Italian Panini, a large ice tea, and a cookie all for under $11 dollars. And wow. Not only was the food delicious, but I was only half done. Ended up having the latter half of the panini wrapped and eaten at home later.  This cafe is comprised of two stories, with sufficient seating throughout. What's problematic though is that it's very hard to find enough seating for a crowd of more than two people. Hell, Even two people. From my experiences here, I've found that typically you have individuals or pairs sitting and dining, not to mention making use of the wifi and/or reading some literature. Which means they'll probably be there a while. You have to be patient and possibly consider the idea that you won't be able to eat there. But despite the seating availability issues, Bourgeois Pig Cafe is an all around great establishment to stop by into. Great service from staff, top notch food for an excellent price, and an interior that induces an escape from all the nuances of living in a major city. On a side note, yes. This place does throw a little bit of a pretentious and hippy vibe. But it's not the place's fault.

Turkey, pesto, avocado, spinach, Swiss, tomatoes, and BACON on the most delicious toasty fociacia bread I have ever had! Granted I still have yet to tackle more of the sandwiches, but I'm still dreaming about this one. Although I must also mention The Pig's Ruben (The Catcher in the Rye) and The Hobbit. I almost made the mistake of saying ""I've had Rubens at many places before so I'm sure this one is nothing special."" Oh no, do not make that mistake.

I loved the quirky atmosphere and all the different seating options (it seems like a lot of students head upstairs with their books but there's also shaded outdoor seating and barstools by the windows). The menu is so massive it's a little bit ridiculous but they do have printed copies to hand out in case you can't see all the tiny writing on the chalkboards. Anyway, once you figure out the menu they ask you where you're going to sit because they bring your food over. I had the Hobbit sandwich and loved it. The avocado and other veggies were so fresh and the crumbly bacon brought it together. My boyfriend decided to get a baked omelette of all things and we both regretted it.

I went on a Tuesday night to study from about 7:30 till 10.  When I arrived it was about half full, with people spread out on the patio, first, and second floor.  It's definitely one of those places where things work in a very unique way, and the staff is going to know immediately that you've never been there before.  But everyone I interacted with was very nice and helpful.  I started by ordering the Merchant of Venice, which I requested to add giardinera to (which they did, sparingly, but at no additional charge).  I picked this one partly because it came in half or full sized, and I only wanted half.  About 1/3 of their sandwiches come in half size, I guess based on ingredients and cooking methods. After you order, you go sit down and they bring it to you.  So I found a cozy seat upstairs and got situated with my study materials, and before I knew it my sandwich had arrived.  It was fabulous.  Every bite scrumptious.  They use Boar Head meats, which is a major plus.  And the sandwich came with a pickle on the side. Later in my study session I went back down to peruse the extensive tea selection and wound up with a fabulous cup of black tea, in a variety I had never seen before.  And I couldn't pass up a cookie, which was absurdly sugary, soft, and huge.  I had to throw away half of it to stop myself from gaining 10 pounds on the spot. And as others mentioned with extreme accuracy, the fellow patrons are uber friendly and will likely chat you up if you make eye contact.  Also, the music is much quiter than the typical commercial cafe, which is fab for studying or reading.   I'm so happy to have found a place that might actually give me motivation to study!",0.9939,0.823,0.156,0.021,0.513960113960114

There are some real gems on there. I really dig their paninis.  The ambiance is perfect as well - you feel right at home and cozy the minute you walk in. If it's a nice day, pull up a chair outside or head upstairs and see if you can snag a spot on the balcony.  The only negatives for me would be what some other Yelpers have already posted - they can be insanely busy at times (and thus a bit slow) and depending on your barista, perhaps a bit snotty, too.

The sandwich was fine, but for seven bucks I would sure like something other than a sandwich and a pickle spear.  The salad was really ordinary.  My wife and I have had salad Nicoise in France and all over the U.S. - sometimes it comes with lettuce (even in Nice), and sometimes it doesn't.  From what I can tell, the ""real"" thing doesn't come with lettuce.  But, if there's not going to be any lettuce, then you had better be damn sure you have lots of good veggies, tuna, etc.  The Pig's salad just didn't get the job done.   Why a one quarter full glass of water you ask?  Well, their self serve water cooler had gone dry and they were way too busy to be bothered with that sort of thing...   The coffee really was great, and I loved the atmosphere.  I will go back for the coffee, and I may try the food again... but it seems pretty clear that this place is way overpriced.",0.9905,0.776,0.197,0.028,0.5766414141414141

The Nicoise Salad is my favorite, but their hummus is also out of this world. For the serious carnivores, I recommend The Hobbit sandwich, a bacon laden, artery clogging sandwich that I have enjoyed multiple times. My favorite soup was the roasted garlic and onion, a creamy blend with hunks of the breath defying veggies.  The atmosphere is cool- set in an old Lincoln Park home with cozy couches upstairs. In the winter, you can often find students studying in front of the fireplace. My main issue with the place is the service. While the hipsters at the register are usually polite, it's rare to get a cold salad or sandwich in under ten minutes and on one occasion, an order of three sandwiches and a salad placed in advance for pickup took 50(!) minutes to prepare.  I don't know what the hold up is but that's my only real complaint and it has been such an issue that I have walked out when I've seen more than two people standing around waiting for their food.",0.9531,0.879,0.101,0.02,0.6190476190476191

I tried to order a cookie but they decided not to make any cookies that day. Boo to them. A while later I asked for a breakfast panini and asked for no tomato. When the sandwich was delivered 20 minutes later in contained tomato and it was gross. The bread was grilled separately from the food and thus it was really just a sandwich with hard bread. The strawberries it was served with seemed to be weeks old. The wait staff was pretty rude and more concerned with having a conversation with themselves, rather than helping me place my order. End of edit I had my dinner delivered last night and it was great. I ordered a tasty salad and the two best cookies of my life. Do not worry, I did not eat both cookies in their entirety. I wanted to though. The sprinkles cookie was amazing. The chocolate chip was good but I would have loved two sprinkles cookies. My salad was fresh and there was tons of lettuce, not just the fatty toppings that I find standard in most of the tasty salads I like. My few complaints were that they were out of some/several of the dessert options but what can you do? Also, the deliveries come via bike messenger so nothing in liquid form can be delivered.

I've spent more hours here than I can count.  The espresso isn't the greatest, but the exposed brick downstairs and the burgandy room upstairs more than make up for it.

Being middle class is all well and good, but I don't know of any restaurants that aspire to be truly 'average.'  Except this one.  Its menu of sandwiches and other basics is solid (but average). There were a couple homemade biscotti selections that looked really good. But its staff was slow (5 minutes to take my order when no one else is in line?) and generally disinterested (um, we only offer two iced coffees, not the one you want.. oh, yeah, I guess I could give you a cup of ice).  Its least bourgeois-like quality was its broad selection of coffees and teas (hot and iced).  Definitely better than the Starbucks down the street or really anything within the immediate Lincoln Park neighborhood.  When December rolls around and the temps dip below freezing, I won't have to worry about schlepping my coffee-addicted self to Intelligentsia on Broadway.  With plenty of unique & tasty coffee choices, decent food, long hours and plenty of comfy cozy seats on either of their two levels - this will definitely be a place to hang out and catch up on some book reading.... ...as long as I have a few hours to kill waiting for the staff to complete my order.",0.9679,0.804,0.145,0.051,0.44396367521367525

2007-07-08,5.0,"The review to end all reviews. Read this and forget all the other anti-hype. Maybe you've been sorting your reviews by lowest-stars to get an idea of what you DON'T want to do. That's fine. That's what I did before I went to the Bourgeois Pig Cafe. I was terrified. I know I'm being hyperbolic, but I was. I had made plans to go to lunch with my friends J. and M. and we'd all read good and bad things about the Cafe. I was fixated on the bad. Oh, this will be awful. Oh, the food will be stale and gross. Oh, the staff will be mean and evil. Well, I walked in and thought ""man, this place really is cramped... the tables REALLY ARE close together, the people upstairs REALLY ARE studying"" if this part of the description for the Cafe is right, obviously I'm going to be unhappy with the service and the food. All this leads up to the front counter: Marty and Sabrina were on duty. I now instantly adore them. My friends and I had no idea that the menu was so long. We'd visited the website to get an idea of what might be our pre-selected choice.. but there was a much longer list in front of us. The ladies told us their favorites, what they didn't care for and what the popular choices were. Just on friendliness and service alone they got 2 stars. J. ordered a pastry and a smoothie. M. ordered a salad. I decided to take them head-on and try their Dagwood just so I could say I ordered it (plus, Sabrina said she'd never seen it made, so she made me a deal that if I ordered it, she'd give me a free brownie and super-size our smoothies. How could we say 'non'?) Less than 10 minutes later, all three meals were at our table (we decided to sit in the front main room because we didn't want to sit outside in 90 degree heat, and we wanted to chat, so we didn't sit upstairs and disturb the study-buddies), and each one of us was raving about the quality of our food. We really were impressed all around. 2 more stars for delicious food that was worth the price. But that leaves us one more star: ambiance. So it's cute. It's not trendy-stark white like out of a Ikea catalog. It's not cookie-cutter and I know a lot of people just love to rip on chain restaurants... and I don't give a hoot. If a chain restaurant makes good food, then I'll go there. I'm more interested in trying NEW things, not sticking it to the man. I, myself, could be labeled a Bourgeois and don't mind it a bit. The apothecary styled teas on the walls and the books all over the place really did make the Cafe a friendly, locally owned gem of a restaurant that makes me question whether the people who went to the Cafe and then Yelped about it later were themselves having a bad day. So I talked to the ladies behind the counter: ""Do you know this place is on  yelp.com  and people are talking some evil about you?"" ""Yup. We read it. Even more, our boss reads it. And all he reads is the bad stuff too."" And I don't blame him. If I wanted to improve my business, I would too. That's where the candid (and sometimes unreasonable) complaints come from -- but I assure you: They're unfounded. If the wait staff had a bad day the day the former Yelpers were there and said ""she was mean to me"" -- they are sorry. Go back. Let them prove to you that it was a bad day for them and we ALL have bad days. I'd never been to the Bourgeois Pig Cafe before and I'd never met their staff prior to patronizing their establishment but I assure you -- this is not our last visit. Not by a long shot.

Anyway, I was in a world of fuckin' pain and needed some coffee. Conveniently located near the El, I saw the storefront with some cafe tables outside and walked up the rickety steps to see a crowded space-wooden floors, natural lighting, a variety of people cold-chillin. I grabbed some NYT and snagged a two person in the horrible location of near the counter and the door and apparently a four person ""study"" group discussing creative energy in the most soul-sucking manner possible. If I could have stopped over-hearing them...I would have. The line did take a while, and the selection is pretty overwhelming-but I was pretty psyched to have a belgian waffle, I got a half caf/decaf, and made a delicious smoothie (mixed berry, mango, banana w/oj). The tally wasn't great, but around 5 bucks for a waffle, under 5 for a fresh smoothie and a damn good cup of coffee-I don't think that is unreasonable city price to pay, do you? There was a whole upstairs but I heard the cackling of undergrads (hey, I just was one-no hard feelings) and wanted a quieter regrouping from hearing all the girls in my four bed room...oh sorry four BUNK-bedroom peeing and farting htis morning.  I want to say this place was fine, not to go out of your way to go here, but I ended up here two more times in my stay here in Chicago.
