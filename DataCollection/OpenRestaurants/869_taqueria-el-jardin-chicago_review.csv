This was a great deal and a decent serving of food. I had two carne asada tacos. My husband had a tongue taco, al pastor, and a carne asada taco. There was a small upcharge on his since he had an extra taco and only chicken and steak are included in the special, but we did thoroughly enjoy our tacos. When asked if we wanted all the toppings we said yes because we kind of assumed it would only be cilantro and onion. However, they put cheese, tomato, lettuce, etc on our tacos, which was fine, but I think next time I would ask for just cilantro and onion. The meat was well seasoned and tasty. I want to try the fried chicken tacos if we're in the area next time. Also the owners were so friendly and kind. Great family business.",0.9832,0.828,0.164,0.008,0.5937830687830687
