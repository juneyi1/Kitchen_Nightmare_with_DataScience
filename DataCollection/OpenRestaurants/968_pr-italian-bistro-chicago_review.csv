I ordered the platter with smoked salmon and fish spread, which for $14 entails 3 small slices of bread, some dry lox, and a dollop of ""fish spread"" with an overcooked hard boiled egg.

It was a beautiful day and decided to wait for a table outside, they invited us to sit at the bar saying we might have to wait a bit as outside table turn over can be slow. Ok, no problem. We ordered drinks (bartender barely made eye contact and seemed more interested in regulars than visitors )... Minutes after our drinks arrived a table opened. We brought our drinks to the table, were greeted by a nice waiter. We ordered an appetizer and our meal. Appetizer came right out as did our salad. As we sat waiting for the rest of our meal, we watched the restaurant fill and we were happy we beat the crowd. As we sat and watched other parties seated after us get their food we patiently waited. Finally, after close to an hour wait, the waiter came over and apologized for the delay saying the cooks were backed up. We sat longer staring at ourselves wondering what was going on. After another 15 mins or so we asked the hostess who basically said ""it's the nature of the beast when everyone comes in at once(again we were there before the rush). The hostess said something about a lot of people ordered chops which backed up the kitchen. (We ordered pasta). After well over an hour wait for our food we finally gave up, asked for our food to-go (assuming it was close to ready) starving we waited. Finally at 8:37 Pm we were handed a bag of food thrown into unappetizing containers. 3 pieces of bread. Basically about Olive Garden quality food at best. A ploy to get us to buy drinks?

We started off with a special of the night, a langoustine scampi with a red pepper coulis. This dish was simply not good and the weakest part of the meal. The meat was iffy and seemed low quality and the sauce was absolutely flavorless, but nothing that a little salt couldn't fix. We then shared the short rib ravioli and the patatoni pizza. The short rib ravioli was served with a delicious brown butter sage sauce. The short ribs were tender, as they should be. The patatoni pizza was incredible! Mozzarella, roasted pork cheek, sliced potatoes, truffle oil, and a little bit of red sauce. Who would have thought about adding potatoes to pizza?! It's genius, and they were my favorite part. Then came dessert, which was the other iffy part of the night. The server came over to take our dessert order. We weren't ready yet, so we were debating what to order in front of him. My partner then said we'll need a moment to decide. The server walks away and then a few minutes later comes back to mark the table with two forks, and two amaros. Okay, we thought, our server is going to take care of us and hook us up with the disgetifs and dessert for free, and we would tip accordingly to compensate.  Dessert comes, good. Bill comes, not good. The server charged us for the dessert... That we never technically ordered. That didn't sit right with me. We didn't make a fuss about it, but I do think it was shady and sneaky. Other than that, the service was good and our server was friendly and talkative.  Also, they have a pretty decent wine list for being a non pretentious neighborhood joint. They have corvina by the glass, which is an unusual varietal to see. They had another varietal, frappato, by the glass. I've never seen that on a wine list; I've never even heard of it. Both were great though, and I highly recommend for those ordering wine with their meal. Will I be back? Yes.",0.9964,0.788,0.177,0.035,0.488754724111867

2016-06-15,1.0,"First time leaving anything below a 3 star, but I guess when your whole table gets threatened by the manager.. you really have no choice but to warn fellow yelpers. Experience: This event happened during Chicago Beer Week and Pizza Rustica was hosting Aquanaut brewery for sampling. There was a group of 8 of us dining al fresco, some of us arrived later so I understand the wait staff may not know we arrived but we waited 20 minutes before going in to grab a menu to have the manager tell us that the waiter will have to bring us our menus.  Most of us ordered multiple drinks and dishes, I was shocked when I went up to the build your own bloody mary bar a second time to get extra olives, that a waitress came up to me saying ""one trip to the bloody mary bar, the drinks are cheap enough"" Throughout the meal, service was so slow, we were guessing that the waiter never dealt with the outdoor seating situation. We asked to split our bills which I guess the waiter didn't hear, when we were doing the math, it seemed that we were over charged for one beer. The waiter said that he would comp the beer, but then THE STORM HAPPENS.. the manager rushed out saying that she wasn't comping anything because we made multiple trips to the bloody mary bar, which it was only me who attempted to make a second trip. She was so unfriendly and uncooperative.. my friend suggested that we just won't pay if this wasn't resolved, then the manager pulls up her phone and takes photos of us and starts yelling at us... it was just a terrifying experience. Food:  The lasagna was absolutely delicious which makes this ordeal kind of upsetting, the pizza was just mediocre, and the bloody mary or tomato gazpacho was flavourless.. like just crack open tomato juice and add vodka.",-0.9844,0.831,0.041,0.128,0.5573333333333335

We paid under $100 for three people with an appetizer, drinks, entres, and a shared desert.

I got mushrooms and black olives in it as I was really just craving for Alfredo sauce. Turned out, there were lots of olives but very few mushrooms in it. Nevertheless, the sauce and the pata was very tummy, perfectly cooked pasta and creamy rich Alfredo sauce. Got an appetizer special on the seasonal menu, fried avacado and pan seared tuna with spicy mayo topping. This was something really different and tasted too good.

In my 2012 review, I encountered poor food presentation and inconsistent quality.  I haven't been back since...why bother when there are far more pleasant dining choices in the area. Tonight I stopped by to pick up a couple of desserts to carry out. The flourless chocolate cake was delish. The tiramisu was a disastrous mess. First, it was frozen and dried out. Secondly, once I let it come to room temperature, the only flavor that was evident was everything else that may have been in the cooler except for sweet creamy cheese. Now add my  dissatisfaction with the management. I called to ask for a refund for the tiramisu. Megan, the manager on duty, first argued that their tiramisu was never frozen. She then condescendingly told me that she would have to void the original sale and re-ring the other item. Oh sigh! When I suggested that she could graciously void the whole transaction for my trouble, I  was scolded via her tone. 'Well, you did consume the other dessert.' I'm not one to look for a 'free lunch'.

I've heard many great things about this place, so I'll chalk this up to a server and the chef/owner having a bad night.  It took an hour for our food to arrive mostly because the waiter forgot to put the order. He never admitted to it, but the chef later did.  They tried to placate us by bringing over some focaccia bread. They brought 3 small pieces for a table of 6. Really?  The food, when it finally arrived, was good, but the bill came and we thought the least they could do was comp part of the pill for the excessive wait.  The chef/owner came over and then proceeded to belittle us by saying, ""What do you want comped? You have nothing on the bill."" It was a $200 bill!  There definitely was something there. First, he only wanted to comp one pizza. We thought it should be more. He pushed back and finally we insisted a pizza and an appetizer should come off the bill.  We should not have had to negotiate this. It should have been offered because the server and the owner/chef knew it was their fault.  Very poor customer service and it will be a very long time before I give this place a second chance, if ever.",-0.8957,0.868,0.043,0.089,0.5265151515151515

The second time, I came here, I sat outside. Again, service was very poor. This was the middle of the day and the restaurant was completely empty.

Check Margherita pizza with sausage that tasted like a 99 cent totino's pizza? Check Pasta that was boring, small portion sizes, and was not impressed? Check A 6th grader could've cooked an equivalent meal and might have even had more dazzle. Lastly - when your kitchen closes at 9:30 you should put that on your website (it says 10pm) and not be an asshole when a potential customer calls at 9:50pm to ask about pizza delivery.

2015-08-01,1.0,"Last night was one of the worst nights I have ever endured at a restaurant. My girlfriend and I went to pizza rustica looking to assuage our pizza and pasta craving, but left annoyed and unsatisfied. We were seated inside and promptly ordered a bottle of wine. Though the wine came in an adequate amount of time, we did not get glasses of water until halfway through our meal even though we asked twice. Our server, though I do not want to reveal her name to hurt her credibility, was absolutely terrible. We started with the pollo O pesto salad to split between us. The chicken was completely overcooked.  After a bus boy cleared our plates our server came back and asked if we were ready to order appetizers even though she took our initial order. This was only a minor inconvenience but when this was coupled with the fact that she hardly showed any attention to us, it was hard to overlook. I ordered a pizza while my girlfriend ordered gnocchi with pork cheek. We sat there for 45 minutes waiting for our food to come out. Though the place was busy we noticed a chef who seemed like the owner talking to the same table for about 20 minutes. In those 20 minutes we also noticed that two dishes resembling what we ordered simply sat on the counter. Sure enough, he brought those exact plates over to us. In terms of the food, lukewarm anything is not traditionally what I like and if my girlfriend knew that pork cheek meant 1 small, round piece of bacon she probably would've avoided it. The worst part was that we had asked our server what our dishes were supposed to be like prior to ordering and she gave no indications other than ""they're delicious"". We didn't complain like we probably should have and simply continued the meal. Our server returned finally and asked about dessert. She said that the fruit tiramisu was something we had to try. Both of us were confused by what that would mean and asked her to describe it to us. Once again she simply said ""it is fantastic"". We ordered it to see why she believed that. The fruit content of our tiramisu simply consisted of raspberry sauce over a plain piece of cake. Finally, we asked for our check and I promptly gave my card. It felt like a lifetime while we waited for them to simply run my card but we noticed our server was instead passing out drinks behind the bar. We figured she was helping with the demand at that point but then she came to the table next to us to drop off drinks without giving back my card. At this point we began making faces of exasperation and the lady who originally seated us asked some servers to find out what was wrong with our table. Quickly she realized we just wanted my card back so she attempted to speed up the situation. This whole ordeal was resolved when our server took our bill from the paying station, went outside to deliver food and drinks, took two tables orders, came inside and delivered others orders, then finally dropped off our check. I simply could not believe she took so much time to just give back the check after everyone in there realized how annoyed we were.  Overall I can get cheaper and tastier pizza and pasta in so many places without dealing with this horrid service.",-0.9811,0.852,0.054,0.094,0.47980967078189307

2015-07-27,2.0,"We were there on Saturday, July 25th at about 7pm.  First of all, the pasta bolognese and meatballs were absolutely delicious.  5 stars for my dinner.   The reason for the 2-star review?  We sat on their patio (which was full).  The table had no salt/pepper.  No silverware.  Water was delivered after about 15 minutes.  We didn't order pizza, so we expected bread to be served.  Nope.  Had to ask for it.  When it was delivered (dropped off, literally), it came with no butter, olive oil, cheese... anything.  So, I asked the hostess for some butter, which is my preference with bread (although olive oil would have been fine).  A man in a white coat came out to deliver the butter, with a stern message.  WE DON'T SERVE BUTTER HERE.  Hmm... OK, so why did you just deliver it to me?  It was a huge mess of butter, too... obviously sliced haphazardly in the kitchen from the stock they use to cook with.  I worked for 18 years in the restaurant business, so I know chefs and owners can be temperamental about these things.  But you never show that to the customers.  Who wants to go out to eat and be scolded?  Not me. I wasn't demanding and if the hostess had said, sorry we don't serve butter, I would have asked for olive oil.  The waitress seemed embarrassed about the man's behavior (he must be the owner or something) and I got the sense she's apologized for him in the past.   Anyhow, my two cents.  We will not be back, despite the excellent pasta.  It's not worth it.",-0.4427,0.886,0.048,0.066,0.47696078431372546

Since when do Italians want to cut back, especially on basil and garlic?? My spaghetti dish (just Linguini, tomato sauce and chili flakes (who can't make this in their sleep?) was okay.

It was incredibly refreshing and a great summer cocktail. My friend had the Jalapeño Margarita which was spicy and so good that I had it as my second drink.  Upon Jackie's recommendation, we had the Rosemary chips which were more like thick sliced roasted potatoes and the Spinach Artichoke Dip. Both were fantastic and a perfect starter for two people. Next we asked for a pizza recommendation and once again Jackie didn't disappoint. She recommend the Tartufo Pizza. This is by far one of the best pizzas I've ever had.

There is $2 charge for every vegetable added to your pasta. With vegetables like me adding 4 different vegetables was $8 on top of the base price of $10. The portions weren't great either, but I have to say the spaghetti was very well made/cooked.  The service was also not that great seeing that it took the waitress 20 minutes to get our check for us.

2015-06-22,4.0,"Pizza Rustica is a place you don't hear much about and I'm not sure why that is. It's probably one of the better Italian restaurants in Lakeview. I say Italian and not pizza because it's just that, an Italian restaurant with really good pizza. Their Margarita pizza is one of the best I've had. Make sure you order it with sausage, you won't be disappointed. The ingredients are fresh and the pizza is always hot and delicious. The crust is crispy and thin, it's really a great pizza if you're looking for something different. The rest of their menu is basically pasta items and then the blackboard menu. Their pasta is absolutely amazing, probably some of the best in Chicago. Everything is made to order and comes out piping hot. It's not a huge menu by any means, but you can mix and match items to create your ideal pasta dish. I love their meatballs and Linguini pasta, it's absolutely amazing.  They used to be BYOB before they move into their new location, that was the best and is why I'm giving them 4-stars instead of 5. They now have a full bar and it's actually really great.

We joked that we used to be able to get half slices (given our group had frequented this establishment often) and that we were ""going to leave"" and he said, ""Well, there is the door if you feel that way.""

Went here last night - during the Superbowl snowpocalypse - for dinner and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it, I'll definitely be back to try more of their pizza and adult beverages. When my date and I walked in we quickly realized that no other patrons were there due to the blizzard. So we had this place to ourselves, score! Really liked the atmosphere - warm, cozy and woody with a dash of sophistication and old worldliness. We were presented with a menu and my eyes danced with delight when I saw their beer offerings. I had a very tasty Belgian Tripel called Piraat, and my date had a hoptastic IPA called Galactica. Nice.  On to the 'za - we had the puttanesca (which was basically pancetta and onion) and the pollo pesto (chicken, pesto, and GOAT CHEESE, yes please!) pizzas. Both were ever so yummy in the tummy.

2015-02-01,1.0,I had heard so many great things about this restaurant and was so excited to try. Firstly I will say the hostess or manager I assume was a pleasure. She made me feel right at home when I walked and which was great. Unfortunately that was the only pleasant thing about me experience here. Our waitress was the absolute worst. It was almost as if we were a second thought to her. My date and I asked several times for a glass of water for him. After some time we just began sharing the one glass she brought to our table. Being that I had never been I was hoping to get an explanation of the menu as most establishments do on your first visit but this was not the case. She seemed somewhat annoyed that I even asked her to review or even suggest items on the menu. When the check arrives I'm hoping to get out of this place with no hassle by paying cash and leaving only to find that she has added 3 extra items to our ticket that we did not order. Only more proof that we were a mere afterthought in her mind the entire night. I really wanted to enjoy this place but for the prices charged and the service and food we received it was a huge let down. I would not visit this restaurant again.,0.6816,0.841,0.089,0.07,0.6051129426129427

All of the tables are pretty close to each other and then there's an open kitchen. The staff was very attentive and kind. In regards to the food, my friend got a cheese pizza but he had to squeeze lemon over it. I got one without cheese. It was almost like a light garlic butter bread. I loved mine. It was fresh- you can just tell they used fresh ingredients- and the crust was so crunchy. They put it in a wood oven so that crust blisters, getting those nice air bubbles. I sampled my friend's too. His was so fresh and light. The portions were big, so I couldn't finish mine; However, I didn't feel sluggish after finishing half of my pizza.",0.9852,0.785,0.215,0.0,0.6189814814814815

2014-08-17,5.0,"Pizza Rustica has been a neighborhood favorite since they were in small space on the east side of Sheridan more than 4 years ago. I have never been disappointed with a meal, and it was long overdue to write a description of the experience. My fiancee and I went last night, a Friday at 5:30. We ordered a bottle of prosecco first, which was promptly served in a chilled, ice-filled silver bucket. Delicious. We followed with a simple caesar salad, which we shared, and paired wonderfully with the prosecco. We were never rushed, and when the salad arrived we were asked if we would like to put in our dinner order; we asked if we could wait, and our server had perfect timing, coming back to ask us right as we were finishing the salad. I ordered penne in quatro formaggi with meatballs. The sauce was a perfect blend of the different cheeses, and not too thick and viscous but not thin, either; perfectly done. The meat balls (2 medium-to-large sized on top) were also excellent- moist all the way through, and easily breakable into chunks. Clearly fresh made. They were not dried out, sad pieces of meat. My fiance had penne and meatballs as well, but with arrabiata sauce. She says it was very flavorful and spicy, in the sense that it had a little touch of heat. She agreed on her meatballs' quality as well. Over the course of dinner, we ordered four different mixed drinks, all excellent and very promptly served, and by this point in the meal, the place was packed to the gills- inside and out. We ordered: 1. The Dancing Buffalo- bourbon mixed with prosecco as a base. Excellent, fun. I love bourbon and I love sparkling whites- paired together was a delicious play on each. 2. Moscato Lime Spritzer- FRESH basil and lime juice mized with moscato. This was absolutely fantastic- wonderful aroma due to the basil, and very refreshing. 3. Cucumber Lemon- Hendrick's gin, fresh cucumber, lemon juice. Another wonderfully refreshing drink. Hendrick's is an excellent gin with a lower-than-usual juniper count, quite different from a number of gins. 4. Blueberry Gin Fizz- Hendrick's gin again, fresh blueberries.... way too much simple syrup added. The blueberries really couldn't speak for themselves. Too sweet. I suppose most Americans love their sugar though, so I suspect most would dig it. Overall, we just had a wonderful evening. We have had many wonderful evenings here, and I was excited to finally sit down and write about the experience right after the fact. With 2 dinners, bottle of wine, a salad, 4 drinks... our bill was $95 and change, before tax. And the quality of each and every aspect of our dinner was stellar: service, attention to detail, pacing. People in Lakeview who have not gone here yet (or folks anywhere in Chicago) are really missing out on fair prices for very high quality food, drink, service- and ambience. Tons of exposed brick, dark stained wood and beautiful, large Edison bulbs giving off orange glows. Wonderful.",0.9993,0.726,0.253,0.022,0.6273696802392454

2014-07-26,4.0,"Love this place, but have noticed a few odd things... We used to live around the corner, and would go almost once/week.  Pizza has ALWAYS been amazing, and I've always loved the pastas :)  I wasn't wild about the salmon when I had it, but my boyfriend loved it.  We went last night for the first time in a few months (since we moved), and it was way less crowded than usual (especially for 6:30 on a Friday).  I arrived a few minutes before my boyfriend, and the hostess almost seemed nervous to seat me before he got there (because we weren't a complete party I guess).  She was super nice, and sat me anyway (which was good, as there was hardly anyone else there).  It seemed like she was nervous she'd get in trouble for seating an incomplete party.  (Thank you for seating me!) Our server was awesome - very attentive and made excellent drink suggestions.  We ordered the buratta and prosciutto appetizer (delicious!).  He ordered the margherita pizza with crumbled sausage, and I ordered a ""create your own"" pasta with gnocchi, tomato cream sauce, mushrooms, spinach, and crumbled sausage.  His was perfect, and mine was almost perfect.  On mine, the crumbled sausage sort of combined to make a sausage patty, which was kinda weird but fine.  We just now finished eating our leftovers :)  We had the flourless chocolate cake for dessert, which was VERY rich and perhaps had a bit too much sauce on it, but was delicious nonetheless.   Some weird things:  1) The way the hostess seemed almost scared to seat me without my boyfriend there (he was 10 minutes after me).  She was very sweet, and obviously made the right call, but it seemed like she was nervous that the manager or owners would get mad at her.  In a super busy restaurant I'd understand...but the majority of the tables were WIDE open! 2) We didn't get the usual bread/oil at the table.  We didn't ask for it, but they used to just bring it out.  We remember once seeing the chef/owner running across the street to get more bread on a super busy night...this time they were not nearly full, and either didn't have bread, or were choosing not to serve it. Maybe cutting corners? 3) Where were all the customers?  We used to go all the time before we moved, and it was always hopping!  We are part of the spring rewards program, and have gone so much that we have received credits at least 3 (maybe 4!) times.  Yay! 4) The owner/chef actually stood out front a few times.  He may have just been getting some fresh air...but it almost looked like he was wondering ""where are all the customers?""  (Hopefully he was just getting fresh air!)  But again...wasn't crowded at all. 5) I follow them on facebook, and I saw yesterday that they actually insulted a reviewer from yelp.  The review itself was indeed a bit silly...but even still, it was a bit off-putting to read the owner (or manager, not sure who runs the page) react so negatively. Our favorite things: 1) Atmosphere.  Even when it's crowded, there's something so romantic about the place.  We love the lighting, the wood, the layout, and the artwork. 2) We have a favorite server :)  Manuel (I hope that's how he spells his name) is the BOMB!  We were hoping to see him last night....miss you Manuel! 3) Food is always SO yummy. 4) Drinks are amazing.   5) I think this is a recent change - they do have the prices on the handwritten blackboard menus.  Thank you for listening to customer feedback! 6) Not just the quality of the food, but the quantity.  I've always left feeling full (and sometimes with leftovers!)  My boyfriend rarely leaves with leftovers...he is always part of the ""clean plate club"" :) I have read some of the recent reviews on here, and it looks like some people have had less than perfect experiences.  Hopefully the owners check here, and take note of all reviews (good and bad), and adjust as needed :)",0.9995,0.718,0.23,0.053,0.5961914936914936

Worth a visit, or at least take out.  The name suggests pizza, and while they make some of the best in the city (with a thin, buttery crust that is entirely unique) you're missing out if you limit yourself to their pies.  Really, the best-kept-secrets (plural!) of this place are their specials and their drinks.  The specials board, 90% different every time I've gone in, is the work of a Chef. Not to diminish the noble Pizza Guy, but most pizza places don't offer (like my last visit) truffled burrata with perfectly grilled summer vegetables or perfectly cooked ribs in an Italian style; blessedly free of the smothering BBQ sauce that masks the poor technique of lesser efforts.  The cocktail menu is playful and seasonal. Being a bourbon drinker, I'm often disappointed in summertime efforts to lighten its somber sweetness. My last visit offered up a lovely blend of mint, orange, anise and bourbon - worth having two. I'd give ingredients, name and details If I could remember, but - I suck.

The actual pizza was good as well.  We ordered half of the ham and cheese pizza as well as a pizza called the ""Ritta"", which was a pepperoni, sausage and cheese.  Pretty traditional, but very good. The set up look great. It had a mixture of a younger hip look quite at the same time appealing to families.

We preceded to wait another fifteen minutes just to get drinks and see our waiter for the first time. We were never offered any bread and oil like we have had every other time we've been there. And I only got one pop was never offered a refill. But I do have to say the food is delicious. I love the Alfredo and the pizza is amazing.

2014-06-02,1.0,"This place is perfect if you have low expectations and like over paying for mediocre food. Went here with my wife and 5 year old daughter.  Server came around to get drinks and my daughter says ""I want pizza, just cheese and sauce"". Instead of asking if we wanted to put that order in right away, he stood there saying nothing. My wife and I figured the restaurant was half empty, no need to rush, we'll just order some wine first. All good. Bzzzz. Wrong.... 15 minutes later, our server comes back around with our wine.  Drops it off and tells us he'll be right back to take our order. Mind you, the restaurant has filled up now and the other server has been ripping through his tables in good order. Finally our server comes back to take our order. Again, my daughter says ""cheese pizza"". My wife tells him she'll have a half cheese pizza.  We order a couple things off the blackboard. At this point our expectations have been lowered to hope we get decent food.   15 mins later... The bruschetta ""porchetta"" appetizer comes out on cheap plain non toasted bread topped with meat that tasted suspiciously like salty turkey. Very disappointing. 15 mins more passes. A basket of the same cheap plain bread is dropped on our table. Huh?  15 mins later, our food arrives. After the server runs away, we realize they brought my daughter sausage pizza instead of cheese. We flag the server down and tell him he brought the wrong pizza, to which he says in an accusatory tone ""you didn't order sausage?"".  No, dude, we did not.  Even if the customer did mess up, don't treat them badly. But really, we told you 3 times we wanted cheese pizza. Unbelievable. At this point it was late and we just wanted to leave. We ask him just to bring the check and take the pizza off.  He them goes and takes care of a few more tables (really?). Then returns 5 mins later and says he'll buy us a free cheese pizza. Head slap!  I suppose it was a nice gesture, but we just wanted him to listen to our request and bring the freaking check. I was starting to worry this would turn into a bad horror movie and we wouldn't make it out alive. 5 mins later he comes back and asks if we want boxes for our dinner.  Calmly, I look him in the eye and tell him to bring the check now as I clutch my bread knife under the table. Finally the check arrives and I nearly faint from the blackboard special prices. Seriously pizza rustica?  You should be ashamed all around.

2014-01-31,2.0,"Let me preface this by saying that it used to be one of my favorite places in the city- BEFORE they moved across the street and got a hot douche injection. It used to be BYOB, and have a lot more of a cozy atmosphere, 1-2 servers, the chef popping by your table, etc. The pizza and pasta were always exceptional, and it had the aura of ""Cheers""- everybody knew your name. But they moved and expanded- which I can understand- but nothing is the same. First thing is that they are no longer BYOB. Again, I worked in restaurants for years, so I understand the concept of how alcohol sales boost the bottom line. They have a decent wine list, but things have been kicked up a notch. The cheapest bottle is around $32. I get it- but this isn't the restaurant I fell in love with. Hell, our bill used to be less than $32! Second- and there is no other way to say it- but it is simply douche-tasic inside now. Gone is all of the charm of a small ""mom and pop"" place. It looks like every other Lakeview wannabe hip establishment: too dark, reclaimed wood tables, oversized chairs, etc. I am willing to let all of this slide, provided the food is the same- but is simply isn't.  The pizza is still very very good. If nothing else, I highly recommend you order some delivery from them. It is spongy and crispy all at the same time. The sauce is great, and the sausage is some of the best in the city. Unfortunately, everything else on the menu has suffered. The place is trying to be something that it isn't, and they are schlepping over-priced food that doesn't hold up in quality. For instance, we ordered the pumpkin ravioli. I used to work at a pretty nice Italian place, so I have had it many times- and it was good here. It was handmade, and pretty tasty. It didn't blow my mind like some other places (I prefer it in a walnut cream sauce to the brown butter that Rustica served), but it was solid. However, there were only 5 pieces. I didn't mind so much, since we were getting pizza as well- but then the bill came. $19. For ravioli.  FIVE.  PIECES.  OF.  RAVIOLI.  NINETEEN DOLLARS!!!!!!! I thought, ""Surely this must be a typo"", so I asked our douchey waiter: ""No sir, that is the price."" ""For FIVE ravioli??!!"" ""They are hand-made."" ""I get that. But there were FIVE of them."" It was at that time that I realized why they didn't have prices on their specials menu. They are flat out trying to bait and switch you.

A couple items that are staples for me are the tirimasu and the penne rosa (add chicken, spinach, mushroom and a little spicy). I typically order for carry out and really appreciate the fact that instead of having the pizza made way a head of time and sitting under a heat lamp, they pull it fresh out of the oven fresh to the box. I am also a HUGE fan of the fact that they have daily specials but the only downfall is that I wish some of these items on the specials list were staple/constant ideas on the menu instead of in rotation.  The only somewhat not so good experience I had once was that it took 45 minutes to get my Ribeye cooked and it was because I think something was messed up with the order (aka it was never put in) but they made up for it by giving us a discount on the check and free dessert.",0.8876,0.836,0.118,0.046,0.6159259259259261

Me and my friend arrived there about 1 pm on Sat. During this time we ordered two types of pizza by the slice. So total we had 4 slices. Two slices for each person is more than enough for one person! I had the Pizza Bianca and the Patate  rosmarino.my  friend Kirsten had the Margherita and the Marinara. A wonderful change of pace from deep dish. We enjoyed our pizzas, and since each slice was cut in squares of 4, we were able to taste each pizza.  We also shared a plate of the Quattro Formagi which is the 4 cheese pasta.  The pizzas were excellent...but the pasta despite the 4 cheeses was sortof bland.  Also, the good included the poor overworked waiter. He was overworked but didn't act like we were a nuisance. I definately would have understood if he did. He did the best he could under the circumstances. And in fact I was suprised he was able to get our order and bring it in the timely manner that he did. So thumbs up for him! Despite the so-so pasta, the wondeful pizza and the cheap check(only $45.55 with a glass of wine for each of us) would bring me back. Yes, even with two stars I probably will return. PROBABLY, and that's because my friend didnt have dried food in her glass and had a better experience. She loved the pasta.

Do they just not have enough servers? Is that why, every other time we've dined in, it literally takes 20-30 minutes for a server to stop by the table? And then another 15 to get drinks, and then once the food gets dropped off, we're pretty much invisible until 20 minutes after we've clearly finished our food. Busboys and hosts occasionally scamper past the table, eyes averted. (Or if you're trying to get seated, busboys and servers avert their eyes from you.) I think once, after that lovely first time, we got bread. Definitely not the other few times we tried. The food itself is still pretty solid, and the drinks are good, but getting any consumable items in your presence can be painful. OK, so maybe we should just get their food for delivery, we thought! Let's skip the long waiting times at an uncomfortable table and just get some pizza brought to us. I ordered a pizza for delivery before 7 on a Friday - not peak hours, really, so when they told me I'd have it within an hour, I figured that was the longest it could possibly take. When I called back an hour and a half later to check in, I was informed that my pizza ""was next to go out"", and then that ""it would be going out in the next round of deliveries"", and then that ""it was still in the oven"". At no point did anyone offer the remotest hint of an apology that it was already half an hour late and my pizza was still in the oven. I was informed that this was ""so it would be hot and fresh when it went out"", but somehow when it got to me 2 hours after I ordered it, it was barely warm. I WANT TO LIKE YOU, PIZZA RUSTICA. I want to give you lots of money. Hire some more fucking service staff, and maybe replace some of the apathetic robots wandering around there now, and I will totally come back.

2013-06-23,1.0,"Dry, overcooked pizza. To the kitchen's credit the pasta was dressed properly and as I would expect it in Bologna, lightly dressed so the pasta speaks and not the sauce but unfortunately the taste of the sauce was terrible.  I believe that people with developed palates would not give this location high reviews. Then why all the great reviews? One possible explanation could be that most of the reviews are by new inhabitants to the city. In other words, border state residents, newly relocated to the city of Chicago. (I'm still trying to detect this phenomenon when navigating through reviews on sites such as this one; especially when a restaurant receives, as in the case of Rustica, a large number of high reviews).  How else could anyone find the food at Rustica delicious? One possible answer is that the folks that give this restaurant high marks are used to chain food taste. Sorry, no offense but if that's what you were raised on that's what you know and like. I usually don't write negative reviews for the sake of the business and its employees and in this case I cannot write about the service as my food was delivered. Regardless, this restaurant will continue to do well as long as there are a new reserve of border state folks with undeveloped gustatory perceptions.  So I write this review for those who were raised in Chicago and in other large cities with ethnic neighborhoods where great food can be found. By the way if you can't get Bolognese sauce right and ""pizza"" is part of the restaurant's name, then the pizza leaves the kitchen dry and overcooked I don't need to taste the rest of the menu.",0.9575,0.858,0.097,0.045,0.5992164502164502

I went on a warm weeknight evening when the patio was open, and it wasn't very crowded.  They have a good beer selection (all bottles though as far as I can tell, no draft), as well as a fair offering of delicious looking cocktails. To eat, I actually did not try the pizza. My boyfriend and I split a salad, a pasta (gnocchi arrabiata), an appetizer off of the specials (don't remember what it was called... but it was like fried polenta ball stuffed with meat and peas, served with marinara, it was pretty good), and also a nutella-ricotta cheescake for dessert.  I really like that the pasta is so customizable - pick your pasta, sauce, and any additions you want (veggies, meat, etc). For each meat addition it's $2.50 which is reasonable,  but each veggie addition is $2 which I think is a bit of a rip off. In terms of flavor I enjoyed the pasta a lot. I also liked that they served a reasonable amount of pasta, unlike a lot of other italian quantity-over-quality restaurants that serve heaping piles of noodles.  The nutella-ricotta cheesecake was kind of meh in my opinion, if I were to get a dessert next time I'd probably get something different. The only real negative that stuck out to me was the service - we never got the bread that other tables were served before their meal (not that I really cared about missing out on those pointless carbs), and it also took absurdly long for the server to bring us our drinks after we had ordered them.

He was the shining star of our dining experience.  We ordered: Steigel Weisse (for him) Grapefruit Basil Martini (for me) Prosecco (for me) A starter of Arancini from the specials menu It's balls of polenta with beef and peas in the center that are fried and served w sauce on the side. It sounded different so we ordered it. This irked me. It arrived with one falafel sized Arancini ball cut in half. I learned after we got the check it was $7....that much for something the size of a small meatball? And cut? If we had been a party of 4 would it been cut into quarters?!? LAME! It was not very good either and it was cold. When it comes to ordering the pizza it's very confusing. We each ordered a slice (which is actually the size of a quarter block of a big pizza cut into several squares...? Weird but generous I guess) They only have one kind of crust and it's very regarded. Cheese with pepperoni and garlic for my dining partner. Tutta for me which is cheese w pepperoni, crumbled sausage, onions, black olives, and blue cheese and I requested easy sauce. Neither of us liked it. My partner was very hungry and he really struggled to eat even a portion. He found it incredibly salty. It was. We both didn't like the famous butter crust raved about. It had no taste of butter or olive oil. It was very dry and hard; it felt like we were eating an enormous super thick crouton with toppings on it. We prefer thin crust, and this crust wasn't thin or traditional thick style but like a hard, book thick stale cracker due to a strange texture. We thought the sauce was bland.

Great for later!

Unfortunately, I do have to add a caveat. The service if you are sitting at the tables near the bar, can be really really slow. I think  we had crappy luck, as our waitress was also the bartender both times we went.  The first time we went there it was in the first week or so of opening, and we actually never got our food.  Nice bottle of wine and some bread when we pleaded with the wait staff, but the food never came.  We left after about an hour and a half. It was really busy that night but still....I like eating when I go out for dinner.  The second time we came (and yes the pizza brought us back) the service was quicker but you had to ask to get bread, and we were almost ready to leave when the pizza finally came.  Add to that the howling bunch of women at the bar who were busy screaming about boyfriends, and well, takeout might have been a better option.  So by all means try this place, DON'T sit  at the high tables near the bar, and perhaps try and go on a weekday.",0.9451,0.86,0.108,0.031,0.43047619047619046

Fantastic. The staff were absolutely great. The day I went in, there was a Stiegl beer tasting. Points 'cos they have this delicious beer available. Stiegl beer guy was friendly, cute and generous with the samples. My cousin-sister and I ended up ordering two Stiegls, so his tasting worked. Yum The pizza. It was good when served hot. We got the Quattri something, with ham/artichokes/mushrooms and the meat pizza with pepperoni/sausage. A half of each, and it was an embarrassment of food for two chicks. A half pizza is A LOT here. I excitedly and giddily  texted a pic to a fabulous pizza snob I know, and a few other people, all ""this is delish!"" The crust that people talk about here is delish, buttery, garlicky - it really is pretty special. It was just a *touch* too thick and cornmeal-y for me, though. Very filling but good. What made me frown. One way a pizza gets points with me is being a good leftover. We had so much food left, that we packed it up to eat later. For me, this means dinner the next day. I tried to eat the leftovers the next day, and they had completely died. Like, it was terrible. Soggy and mealy. This made me sad, because it really was great pizza when it was fresh. Maybe that's a bad way to judge a pizza, but it's something that is important to me.  That said, I'll come back here. The pizza WAS good, I just won't order too much food again so I can consume it all in one sitting.

Nice wines and drinks menu, too. I can't blame them for getting away from the BYOB thing.

I've seen large parties of, say, 10 people come in to Pizza Rustica with bottles of wine from the liquor store a few doors down, order a couple of pizzas, and stay for hours, drinking and having a good old time.

We started with glasses of wine (not a lot of Italian representation on the list, for some reason), and proceeded to order a ""half"" pizza each.  This amounted in plenty of leftovers, FYI!  They advertise the half as ""four slices,"" but really the pizzas are rectangular with many little slices, so I don't know where they get the ""four"" from.  We got a half margherita and a half grilled vegetable - I didn't like mushrooms, so they subbed in spinach for me (they would've subbed in anything, all toppings are the same price, so that's cool!)  In fact, rather than ""build your own"" pizza, I'd recommend ordering a pizza that is *almost* what you want, then adding an ingredient or swapping one out. It'll probably be cheaper. The margherita pizza was nicer than the grilled vegetable, for some reason. Both had a really crispy, buttery crust - though this is only apparent in the edge pizzas, the center pieces don't have a crisp bite, because the bottom crust isn't crispy (slight bummer).  I think the difference was the cheese, and the fresh basil on the margherita.  The grilled veggie pizza just tasted one note and a bit flavorless, aided slightly by red pepper flakes in a jar on the table. It's fun to try different half pizzas, so everybody gets something they like.  And it's a fairly inexpensive night out, with friendly service.  Our bill was about $40 for the two half pizzas and a glass of wine each, very reasonable.  I'd come back and try something different, but overall I thought the pizzas were nice, but lacking that extra zing that would make the place really special.",0.9865,0.853,0.127,0.021,0.4414673311184939

2013-01-05,5.0,"Pizza Rustica is an awesome local Italian and pizza place, located less than a block from the Sheridan Red line stop. The food here is great.  They make their noodles from scratch, and you can tell the difference.  You can mix and match types of pasta, sauces, and ""add-ins,"" like chicken, meatballs, or crumbled sausage.  They also make really good pizza, with their own homemade butter crust, fired in a brick oven, and which is very distinctive. Other than the consistently good food, another reason I enjoy coming here is because the atmosphere is pretty cool.  The dining area is large and open, with exposed brick walls that display artwork from local artists.  The wood tables are solid and tasteful, and the larger ones make me feel like you're at a mead hall or in a European kitchen.  You can also see much of the kitchen from the dining room, just like something out of Hell's Kitchen or other television restaurant shows. One final word of advice:  If you stick to pizza, pasta or other entrees, the bill should end up being reasonable.  However, like most restaurants, if you start stacking on appetizers and alcohol, you may be surprised at how pricey your final check becomes.  Rustica does have a pretty good beer and wine list, but you pay for what you get.  The appetizers can also be a little disappointing, in terms of quantity of food for what you pay for.  My boyfriend and I usually just drink our own wine at home before or after dinner here, and don't bother with ordering appetizers here anymore.",0.9139,0.838,0.112,0.049,0.5234353741496598

2012-12-09,1.0,"A review I did on Yelp that somehow disappeared(?)... 01/20/07 After hearing many good things about Pizza Rustica on this site and in the Reader, we decided to try it out.  When we arrived, we were told we'd have a table in 5 to 10 minutes so we sat at the bar waiting for our table.  We were never asked if we wanted something to drink or if we wanted to see a menu.  After requesting menus we read the descriptions of the food as it described salads (~$6.50) and pastas (~$12.50, add ~$2.50 for grilled shrimp or chicken) topped with aged parmesan, and fresh oven baked pizzas.  As we read this, we watched the kitchen staff cooking dishes, sprinkling Kraft Parmesan from the resalable bag on top of salads and pastas, while pulling frozen pre-cooked shrimp or chicken out of frozen food aisle bags and adding it to pans of heated up pasta to defrost.  We then watched one of the pizza makers come out of the back room with a stack of 6 pre-baked and pre-sauced pizzas and proceed to cover them with toppings and throw them into a large warming oven which melted the cheese and heated up the crust.  The atmosphere in the restaurant was drab, far from the warm and quaint that had been advertised.  As you sat at the bar, you had to watch the dishwasher and look at a kitchen area littered with dirty equipment.  After approximately 15 minutes, a four top opened up and sat covered with the last party's dirty dishes for another ten minutes as two servers scrambled to make salads out of pre-packaged lettuce and serve ten or twelve tables between the two of them.  We watched several customers try to flag down wait staff and a couple of tables look around the room quizzically as they waited for at least 25 minutes to get their salads.  When the table was finally cleaned off, we inquired if we were the next party after it sat empty another 5 minutes.  They said there was a party of three waiting outside for the table and our table would be ready in another 5 or 10 minutes.  The server went out and looked for the party but they were no where to be found.  She walked back in the restaurant and went back to serving dishes.  We again asked if the four top was available and she said the other party had left and we just had to wait a couple more minutes.  Just as she said this, a party of three walks in and asks if they can have the table.  She gives them the empty table even though they were not the party of three waiting for the table.  We had been waiting for at least 30 minutes at this point and the table had been vacated for at least 15 minutes.  After she walks away, the third person in the group says goodbye to the other two and they take the table with absolutely no wait.  We told the waitress we'd been waiting for over half an hour and she said she can't ask the two people to leave the table because they had already been seated.  At this point, we decided this was the last place we wanted to spend our money and proceeded to leave.  Spending 12-15 dollars on frozen food aisle chicken and Kraft processed ""parmesan"" after waiting 35 minutes for a table can only be characterized as a mistake.  We elected to head to Pizza D.O.C., were seated in 2 minutes even though they were extremely busy, and paid identically prices for higher quality food and service.",0.8176,0.922,0.047,0.03,0.42816578483245155

I hope we just had a bad experience, but I am sad to say  that we probably won't try our luck with it again.",-0.9413,0.765,0.075,0.16,0.634888888888889

It is right down the street from one of my GF's houses and the drill is usually, she picks me up from the airport and we go right to pizza rustica. They recently (within the last year) moved into a new spot and have a liquor license, they used to be BYOB only but now they allow both which is nice. The new space is also larger so you do not have to wait nearly as long for a table.  The pizza is DELICOUS! It isn't Chicago style it is thinner and square shaped cut into square and rectangle pieces. I have tried a bunch of different ones there and even though I tend to be a pretty typical pizza person (pepperoni please I love all the unique pizzas they have here and truly enjoy them. They also have a good selection of yummy pastas.  I am unfortunately subtracting a star because I think the service is a bit spotty. I have met the owners and they are very sweet!

We were told upon arriving that they are no longer BYOB, which I understand happens, and asked if we could still enjoy our wine with a corkage fee. I was advised that the corkage would be $40.00! I could understand $10 - $20, $40 seemed rather extravagant for Pizza Rustica. Since i wasn't going to bring my bottle into Wrigley Field I asked to talk to a manager to possibly get an exception or negotiate a lower corkage and was infomed that one wasn't available and not sure when one would be available.

The rosemary potato pizza was salty and plain bad.  I only tasted one piece.  Our table was never approached again (they must have sensed our displeasure), and had to find our server to get a check.

The menu is fairly extensive with Northern Italian food choices and even longer when it comes to libations. I never thought I'd say I'd be happy to see $8 martinis, but when they are pushing $12-14 elsewhere, eight seems reasonable. Reasonably-priced wines by the glass ($6-7.00) and beers as well. We were iced-tea totalling, so no chance this trip to sample the hooch. Our lunch order was simple. Split a Rustica salad of spinach, artichoke and goat cheese and a 1/2 order ($13.75) of Quattro Stagioni pizza. More artichokes, tomato, mushrooms and ham. This pizza is addictive. The ingredients are fresh and well-matched. The crust is like a thinner version of what is so good about Lou Malanati's. I am so glad I finally made it here. Totally lived up to my expectations. Needless to say, we cleaned our plates and left nothing to take home. The 1/2 pizza was a good serving for two adults. There are lots of other menu items: sanwiches, salads, pastas, which all sounded good and which I'm sure live up to the flavor and freshness of the pizza.  I rather wish this were my little neighborhood spot, but I don't think I can go through the trouble of moving! The total bill was $25.50 for two. That was without tip or drinks. and sharing, so a little on the high side for a lunch budget, but worth every penny. Our server Josh could not have been more friendly or more an advocate of the place. Great to have a server who enjoys his place and his plates. The food arrived timely, too. Could be the best thin crust pizza I've had in awhile. Where sometimes the Neoplolitans are a bit dry, and others too swimming in slippery sauce, Pizza Rustica was the perfect blend.

I suppose the cheese at some points slid off too easily, but overall, this pizza was epically amazing.

2012-05-16,5.0,"Updated space and location... Deserving of a Yelp review update!  Had a chance to snag lunch at one of my all-time favorites, Pizza Rustica. In fact it was one of my VERY FIRST Yelp reviews all the way back in March 2007. Yes, over 5 years ago. And I was going before that. I loved, loved, loved the cramped little quarters, the loving din rising above buttery crusts and bottles of wine bought from the trashy Sheridan ""L"" liquors across the street...I loved it all. I went on multiple dates (even one with my now...fiance...see, it works!), family dinners, friends, etc. It's a great, great spot.  And they've taken that hella good mojo and moved it across the street. Pizza Rustica is all grown up. And that's ok! It's a great improvement because despite the charm of a 20-seat restaurant, the natives get restless and the wait times could be long. Welcome to their new space (literally directly across the street) which boasts 4x as much seating, a huge full bar to perch at, and a huge sidewalk patio! It's really quite the spread.  The menu has stayed the same, so not to fret...that ""Garbage Pizza"" can still be yours! (or mine, as it were). The major addition? BOOZE! P-Rustica is no longer BYOB, which is somewhat sad because we all know that can be sort of fun, but also nice for them to be able to be a bit more profitable slinging the booze. Belly up and order some of those specialty cocktails (Italian-inspired!) or wine. They are all still very affordable, and will complement the experience nicely.  My colleague and I enjoyed a lunch out on the patio...their minestrone still simple, filling and wonderful accompanied by a pesto chicken salad that hit the spot. IT was a bit too heavy to try pizza for me on this particular day, but from the looks of the tables around me, things have not changed in that regard.  So in short: new deluxe space, cocktails and booze (no more BYOB), great service remains, still charming and delightful.

Usually, I go the takeout route from here since I live down the street, but we decided to wait out the Saturday night date crowd in order to check out the new digs. The remodel is pretty awesome - the space is so much bigger and there's an open kitchen so you can see what's going on in there. We got to the restaurant at around 8:30pm, and things were still very busy but the wait wasn't very long. While we were waiting at the bar, we were suggested a few aperitif cocktails by the woman who I think is a co-owner (her husband is the chef). I had the Venetian Spritz, which was a perfect refreshing drink. One thing I never realized I was missing out on by only getting takeout was that there are three chalkboards full of in-restaurant specials hanging on the walls. These seem to be the real-deal, full-on authentic Italian specialities. I had a pasta with spicy crab sauce which was seriously loaded down with crab meat (and only $16!) and the boy had the bucatini amatriciana, which I thought hands-down beat my pasta. Will definitely be returning often now to check out all these specials! My only complaint would be that they seemed to run out of a lot of things by the time we sat down to eat (about 9pm on Saturday night).

2012-05-13,1.0,"Today was like something out of Hell's Kitchen and  validates the growing list of concerns.  Things were so bad that if we were in the Trump Board Room, the female owner (Juliette -who I subsequently found cited as this business' downfall in multiple other Yelp posts) would be (and SHOULD BE) fired!   The longer she's around, the deeper this place will tank!   As someone who has done organizational re-engineering, I am 100% clear that there is no possibility of change as long as she is involved. I selected PR's Mother's Day Brunch because I loved PR and I believed my 3 guests would, as well.  I always found the food great, and the service good.  It was not until I decided to do this Yelp that I realized how much bad press the place - and more specifically, the female owner, Juliette - is gathering. None of my 3 guests will go back and I'm now on that list, too - at least as long as Juliette is involved.    The short version is that we had a waiter who busted his behind while Juliette sipped champagne behind the bar entertaining guests for Mother's Day (which she pointed out to me when I complained to her. Our waiter literally was breaking a sweat serving 7 or 8 tables - inside AND outside.  He was an all-in-one: waiter, the server, and busser!  Bussers only seemed to emerge as the family table was being seated (some 15-20 people).   Another female server seemed to have only two or three tables with 2 of them being two tops in the bar, and one other table in the restaurant.    Why was one waiter the only one saddled with all these tables - alone?  Why would the employees be devoted to a family event at the expense of the customers an support of other staff?  Why the inequity in staffing assignments with one guy having to bust his behind and another server doing virtually nothing?  Why was this server not 'stepping in' to run his tables?  Why was the hostess/owner not running tables to assure her customers were taken care of?  Why would the owners not schedule their family event after their restaurant's special brunch ended at 2pm? I'll both give credit and cut slack for the brunch because it was a new concept with the option to select 5 out of about 10-12 items.  Nice idea, but attention to the details lacked.    One guy taking orders, serving, and clearing made it a disaster - particularly since one large dinner plate was used for each item. Do the math, and you'll find we ultimately had 20 dinner plates hit out table - plus 2 more for a child!  Add to that the service the waiter had to provide to other tables and it's amazing he did not walk out.   Quality of food preparation varied.  A couple items were significantly undercooked and a couple were very good.  Most were just OK but to PR's credit, the kitchen got my custom ordered eggs perfect (which I ordered in lieu of an omelet)!   Overall, presentation was acceptable - good in some cases - albeit portion sizes varied for the same food for different people. Service was the biggest issue - but it is the result of ABYSMAL management, not lack of effort from the server. Food service was sporadic. To the waiter's credit, he first brought the pancakes for the child but no syrup or bacon.  Not and issue for  adults, but for a kid  - huge!  Big lulls for the rest of the food.  As more and more food was delivered, we kept repositioning the array of dinner plates.  This meant we had to stop eating every time the server brought something because the table was not made to handle the sheer volume of plates.  One person got no food til we mentioned it but by then nearly everyone was done.. After we were given the check, I motioned for the chef/owner but the hostess came over and at her request, I outlined concerns. I then told her that I was shocked that she was sipping champagne behind the bar while all this was going on - especially since it was her restaurant! She interrupted me and unabashedly stated how this was Mother's Day, that she was celebrating with her children, and I had no business telling her anything about what she was doing in her restaurant.    At this point,  the chef/owner (husband?) interrupted and asked her to let him take care of it.  She refused to acquiesce and continued to justify her choice to celebrate.   Perhaps she's from the Marie Antoinette School of ""let them eat cake"". She said if she knew there were problems she would have addressed them.   I pointed out that she could not possibly know there were problems if she was behind the bar drinking champagne while 1 waiter is running around literally sweating to keep up!  I explained to the owners that my intent was to resolve this ""in house"" then explained because of her attitude and lack of professionalism, I'd turn to Yelp to which she replied, ""Of course, you will!""  An amazing response but not surprising given that she is self-serving rather than customer service oriented.  STAY AWAY AS LONG AS JULIETTE IS INVOLVED.",0.9945,0.835,0.111,0.054,0.5422238514173998

2012-05-01,2.0,"My feelings about this visit were so strong, it caused me to join Yelp today. I have, over time, frequented Pizza Rustica fairly regularly.  I had always had a very pleasant experience for both service and food.  I recently drove by and observed the new location and was very excited to revisit one of my Chicago favorites. Ohhhh P.R., how could you go so wrong so quickly? I reviewed many recent yelps about this location, and it seems there is a definite pattern emerging.  I'm sure you can identify it yourself if you look closely. My experience:  We were seated right away on a Monday night by a very friendly hostess.  It was moderately busy.  I love to see places succeed and do well!  Service:  I had no issues with the waiter, though he did seem overextended.  Honestly I think a lot of the service issues I have read about here are due to poor organization in the kitchen and dining areas.   Wine: it did take a long time to get a glass, but see above.  Very light pour for a glass, considering that the bottle is priced only 3x the price of a glass.  VERY light pour.  Like, INSULTINGLY light pour.   Food:  Ahhh, this hurts but the pizza last night was pretty awful.  I have had so much GREAT pizza from P.R. that this surprised me immensely!  I had brought a new diner with me, and I was embarrassed and making excuses for it.  The pizza should never have left the kitchen.  It was burned around the perimeter and nearly undercooked in the center.  The lack of evenness is difficult to understand.  I have theories but no evidence.  However, that pizza really should NEVER have been allowed to be served.  I carefully tore off the crust from the pizza, and laid it upside down on my plate, showing that it was black as I continued to eat toward the center.  I really expected the waiter to question this at some point, or the hostess who was busy running plates to tables around me.  But no.   Oddity: Very strangely, the bill total came to $33 and change.  I put a fifty down for it.  The waiter left to get change, came back and asked me if I had anything smaller...  That just seemed so incredibly odd to me.  I explained the only thing I had smaller was a $20, so it was up to him.  He managed to find correct change for me. Why didn't I complain about the pie?  You have to pick your battles in life, and this is JUST a pizza.  One pizza, during one meal, in one day in my life.  I always figure if the chef/owner cares about his success, he'll make sure everything that goes out of the kitchen will be absolutely right.  Conclusion: I have no doubt that the new P.R. location will be a success.  There are any number of businesses I consult which survive despite their best efforts to fail.  I sincerely hope they take some of the most recent feedback to heart, examine their systems or hire a consultant to improve their service, and set aside the hubris that immediate success breeds.  There has definitely always been an air of boastful pride in P.R.; old location and new. Will I return?  Probably, because one terrible pizza isn't going to turn me off.  But will I return as quickly or as often as I did before?  Probably not, and definitely not until I get over being charged full price for a pizza that was half burned and obvious to anyone who took a moment to look.",0.9735,0.759,0.14,0.101,0.49982068086234743

2012-04-21,1.0,"Came here with a couple of friends on a Friday night at around 7:30. The restaurant was packed, so we headed for the bar to sit down until our table was ready. Around 15 minutes later, we were asked if we planned to order a drink at the bar, and when we replied ""no, we brought our own wine,"" they asked us to not sit at the bar so that paying customers could sit there. I've never really experienced anything like that in my life, but that was pretty mild compared to what happened once we were seated (besides, they charge a $3.50/person corkage fee anyway for BYO so they could have just offered to open our bottle at the bar).  So after standing for another 20 minutes, we were seated at a table, and before we had even hung our coats up, the waiter came by, out of breath, and told us that the restaurant is slammed and pizzas are taking an hour at least, so we should get our order in ASAP and not be surprised when the pizza takes a while. Ok- no problem, we had a bottle of wine and didn't mind waiting. He came by five minutes later and we told him we were ready to order, and with his reaction, you'd think we asked him to move a mountain. He basically started yelling that he has other tables and can't take our order right at that very minute, and that we shouldn't be in such a rush. Whoa, okay, I thought you wanted us to get our order in ASAP. So we get our pizza, and are sitting there enjoying it with the wine, and next thing you know, the pizza is about 2/3 done, and the waiter comes by to let us know that he ""loves us"" but the manager is yelling about the table so we have to leave and he's going to get us a box. EXCUSE ME?! I have never before been asked to leave a restaurant, let alone before I've even finished my meal. It was only 9:30 at that point, and our pizza had arrived at about 9:10.

2012-04-15,5.0,"This is my favorite pizza place and my favorite restaurant in Chicago. I go at least once a week and on opening week of their new location, I was there three times because I missed their pizza so much while they were closed for the move. I've been a customer of Pizza Rustica for many years. It's my neighborhood spot where a good friend and I go to catch up and chit chat over a bottle of wine and great food. And it's the place I take pretty much everyone I know after they get tired of hearing about how much I love this little spot called Pizza Rustica. Everyone that I've taken there has ended up loving the place too. I go in there so often that the hostess greets me with a hug. The staff knows our ""regular"" order: a half margherita pizza, a rustica salad with blue cheese instead of goat cheese, and penne pasta with salsa rosa sauce. My friend and I share everything. Sometimes we get tiramisu. Every bit of the meal is absolutely divine. The staff are wonderful people - really nice and great at customer service. The Italian accents add a feeling of being in Italy where good food and long conversations are valued highly and life doesn't seem as rushed and frantic as it does in Chicago. Pizza Rustica treats their customers like family or good friends. They were able to relocate to a bigger location because they have great food and great customer service and that made them successful enough to move to a larger space. The new space is a lot more complex to manage than the small spot they used to have. I see the complaints on this site about their customer service and it saddens me. I know the staff well and they've been delivering awesome customer service for many years, week in and week out. They are learning how to manage their new space and I have no doubt they will master it and get into a groove in just a bit more time. I had to write a review because I adore Pizza Rustica and they're not the horrible place at all that some people are writing it up to be. They're just on a learning curve. My advice is to go in on a night when you aren't in a rush. Relax, enjoy some wine, enjoy your company, and have some great food. If it takes a little longer than anticipated, so be it - enjoy the extra time with whomever you came with. If you think that's a hassle, then just hold off for a few weeks and I'm sure Pizza Rustica will have their system down soon at the new location. Apri il vino e buon appetito!

We paid our bill and moved to the bar area to finish our drinks - ones purchased from them.  The half bottle of wine we bought was put in a bag.  We set it on the bar and a member of our party tried to order a glass of wine from the bartender.   This is where things broke down...Rude Julia comes behind the bar and tells my friend that she will pour our BYOB wine for her - at the bar.  My friend said it wasn't necessary - as that is weird.  She was happy to order a glass from them.  Julia pours our BYOB and leaves.  Five minutes later she comes up to my friend and tells her that 'in the future, she is not allowed to drink BYOB wine at the bar.""  We were blown away. Now, nothing has been said to her up to this point.  But after that last comment, I approached her to let her know that was rude and unnecessary.  Instead of exhibiting proper customer service and listening to me - I didn't yell or raise my voice - she interrupted me, got angry, argued with me, and then said ""my house, my rules"".    I kid you not.  At this point, her husband came out of the kitchen and asked me what was going on.  When I tried to talk to him, she came over and interrupted me again.  I walked away.  We paid our bill and went across the street to Oh Fusion.  So happy Fornello is close by. So, Rude Julia, you exerted your authority in 'your house'.  I sincerely hope you practice better customer service in the future as there are a lot of dining options available out there.  I will spend my money at those places.",0.8667,0.835,0.093,0.073,0.5197502047502046

2012-03-28,1.0,"I have to say I was really excited to try this place as a friend recommended it to me.  The restaurant apparently was small and then opened across the street from its old location.   I walk in and the restaurant is decorated nicely.  The atmosphere was nice.  My friend and I got there right before their busy time.   We were seated.  A few minutes later the server asks for drinks. Everything seems okay from there.   We receive our drinks; order our Caesar salad, and the large tutta pizza. Fast-forward 15 minutes a couple is seated next to us.  They also order their drinks, appetizer and pizza.   As we are waiting our server is also bartending and not really paying attention to the customers she has seated. Fast-forward 20 minutes and we get our salad with an apology stating ""sorry there was a mix up in the kitchen.""  As the server walks away the couple next to us gets ALL their food.   After eating our salad (which was not the greatest) we never saw our server again.  Fifty minutes into our experience I spoke with the manager and explained what exactly was going on.  She apologized and said she would come back to let us know when the pizza was going to be coming out.  We didn't see her for 10 minutes. That is when I got up and told her we were leaving.  She then asked, ""You're going to pay for the salad right?""  I was not very happy about it, but I guess since I did eat it I would.  I told her it was rather rude that she would make us pay for a salad.  Then she asked, ""oh your pizza is done, would you like it boxed up to go. "" We left without paying for anything. Her final words were, ""Sorry we are human and we make mistakes.""  I understand that completely but at least have the customer service skills to run your restaurant.  If the server would have been honest with me and told me that she forgot to put our order in (which is really what the mix up was) I would not have been so upset.  The server also got major attitude because of my complaint.  She was too busy in the bar to take care of her own customers. Apparently moving from a smaller space to a bigger space has not worked out too well for Pizza Rustica from the reviews I have read.  Maybe Pizza Rustica has grown to big for it's britches or bitten off more than it can chew.

2012-03-27,5.0,"I remember when Rustica, what we in the know call it for short, first opened up.  I made the mistake of ordering delivery and to be frank I was sorely disappointed.  So much so that I avoided going back for a couple of years...until my neighbors convinced me to give it another try.  I've lauded them ever since and I recommend them every chance I get.  Sorry to all the people who have endured long waits due to the popularity of this establishment.  I claim no responsibility but I certainly haven't helped the matter.  Needlees to say I was eagerly anticipating the reopening.  We showed up opening night not so much to have a great meal, which Rustica rarely disappoints, but rather to support a great business that decided to stay in our community.  We still had a great meal, though the new staff needs some work, and that was due to good food, great company and a wonderful NEW atmosphere!  For those who are complaining about the service this firs week, what can you say, yeah it needs work but remember he had to hire almost 3X the staff and train them all.  No more ""Two young Italian guys"" serving the whole joint.  (Shout out to Manuel).  Yeah, I said ""Shout Out""... Dating myself.  If people can't understand the difficulty in staffing and training a new restaurant and therefore choose not to come back, well that's just less of a wait for me.  I'm positive the bugs will be worked out soon enough if they haven't been already.  This is the kind of place that's like Cheers, you walk in and everybody knows your name.  It's nice to have that personal feel and that's what Rustica is to us.  Thanks Stefan for staying local.  We'll be back to enjoy your new vision!!!",0.9978,0.708,0.252,0.04,0.46310986310986313
2012-03-27,5.0,"I have been coming to Pizza Rustica since the first week that I moved into the neighborhood (almost 8 years ago) when I ordered their pizza one evening.  They have become almost part of the neighborhood family and their service and food has always been awesome.  From their pizza (margherita pizza + sausage) to their specials (highly recommended), their food has always been fantastic.  I know that Pizza Rustica's goal is to basically be that neighborhood restaurant where you don't have to spend a lot of money to eat good food and hang out with friends and family.   I saw the recent negative reviews on Yelp and figured that I should probably add my comments especially since they moved across the street to their new location recently.   I was there with my friends, who have also been going to Rustica for years, as well as my wife and litte 8 mo. old son on the opening night on a Monday.  Granted our service perhaps was not as stellar compared to past time but we were there with an open mind.  Perhaps the worst time to go with long wait times but like all transformations, it takes time for them to get into the rhythm of things.  We definitely saw the frustration on both sides of the coin.  Overall, the food was good (ordered the clam pasta special) and we had an great time catching up with friends.   I believe people need to relax and understand what a huge transformation Pizza Rustica has undergone from a tiny single kitchen restaurant that fit ~30 people (barely maximum) to a new spacious and beautiful restaurant across the street with almost 5x the number of seating capacity.  They added almost 6x the number of servers as well as new cooks so of course there is a huge learning curve of training and just the nuances of their restaurant that need to be adjusted to.    Their new kitchen, with extra cooking capacity, a new oven (yay - faster pizza) and various new kitchen appliances will help with the cooking.  They even added a deep fryer (that means perhaps more calamari more often?!). Rustica also added a new wine menu (cheap good wine - which you may have a hard time beating in price even compared to BYOB of other wine - I don't think they are there to make a profit from their wine menu) and of course also have a full bar as well.  We may occasionally bring our own wine to dinner but will definitely explore what they have in their menu.   For those that went recently and feel that they did not have a good experience, I guarantee that you will have a different experience once they figure things out.  My only comment is to give them another shot perhaps a month or so from now.   Rustica will always be my neighborhood Italian restaurant and family.  :)",0.9961,0.805,0.161,0.034,0.5228246753246754
2012-03-25,2.0,"As many other _former_ loyal Pizza Rustica customers, I was very excited to see their business was expanding to a bigger location (w/ a bar) across the street. I was a little sad that the days of BYOB were ending but at least it was still BYOVino!  I had the chance to finally check out the new place last Friday. Upon my arrival the place was packed and I put my name in for a table of 4 before going to buy wine down the street. The hostess was clearly unorganized and said the wait would be 35-45 minutes. She also insisted we buy drinks from them that with the $3.50 corking fee per person (say what?!) it was a better deal. Sure, why not? I was feeling lazy anyway... Well here is where things really started to go wrong. The bartender ignored us for about 15 minutes and when we finally got someone's attention they threw a couple menus at us and disappeared. I eventually was able to order a glass of wine that came from a bottle that had gone bad. Lord knows I do not often let a glass of wine go to waste but this was so bad I had to say something. When I finally got the bartenders attention again he just shrugged his shoulders and walked away.... Terrible service!  Without going into further play by play of my experience, I am sad to say it was not just the bartender that was bad. From the hostess to our server everything was a disaster. We waited an hour and a half for a table. In fact, it took so long the other two people in our party had to leave (without eating) to catch a movie.  The pizza is of course still excellent!

We waited about another 10 minutes before we were even given water - the waiter rushing around clearly not prepared for his section of tables.  In fact, the whole staff everywhere was rushing around - definitely not a prepared bunch.  After placing our order about 20 minutes into sitting down (we knew what we wanted to order basically when we were seated, but had a hard time tracking down our waiter) - we waited. Finally our pizzas arrived.... and what a presentation.  The pizza comes out on plastic cutting boards that completely take over the entire table.  With no room for our tea cup sized plates, we ate at the edges of the table.  Recommendation to the owners - try purchasing some risers for the pizza - or consider getting larger tables.  The former is less expensive.   The pizza came out dry, and one of them was half burnt - after complaining, the owner took this pizza off the tab.  But honestly, we shouldn't have to complain for someone to think a half burnt and dry pizza isn't acceptable - even on a busy night. There was no flavor in the pizza and it was overall two thumbs down by all 5 people in the party.   I'll not be going back - even if they manage to hire experienced staff and chefs who know how to make a pizza.",0.8687,0.871,0.071,0.058,0.401288394145537

The toppings were sparse and burnt, the cheese was missing in some places, the saving grace was the crisp, sugary crust. Or maybe it was the sauce that was sugary. Either way, something in every bite tasted a bit like dessert.  Unlike the other reviews, I thought the service was good. It's a small restaurant, so I noticed that most people were dropping their silverware, partly because the tables are really slippery. The staff treated this very normally, anyone available was replacing the silverware hastily. I wish there was a bread basket served while waiting for pizza; me and my date got a little too drunk waiting 45 minutes for the pizza to cook. We kind of just watched other people eating, wishing it would get here sooner.

Back to the food- it's terrific. The pizza is cooked to a crisp, flaky crust and the toppings are spread out enough that you get enough of each without it being overkill. For newcomers, I would recommend getting a half pizza- it's huge and can easily fill two people if need be. Because it's a BYOB it wins points as well. However, there is a small corkage fee ($1.75 per bottle of wine, which I don't think is very cool at all). Finally, there's a couple places within walking distance to pick up beer/wine/whatever if you run out.  As others have pointed out, I would recommend calling ahead because it's a smaller place and gets jammed quickly, or get in early before dinner rush.

I've traipsed under the Sheridan El stop more than a few times, saw this place, murmured how awesome it would be to eat pizza if I didn't just have Thai and carried on.  But not this time; and never again.  Understand I live South and we're blessed with all but BYO beauties. All cuisines have gems in a one mile radius but I have to drink their wine, not mine. It could be worse, but it could be so much better. And PR, well, it delivered.  My Aunt Susan always said, ""Before you get married, have sex with an Italian man."" I was 16. Sure it wasn't, ""Stay focused and go to college"" but just as important life advice to a young woman who sought to be worldly. Though I meandered through the love languages of Mexico and India, I never landed in the sheets near Sicily. So, listening to the men of PR was as sensual an experience as could be had with my (lovely, one-of-a-kind, forever and ever) husband sitting next to me.  We got there early with another pair of lovebirds. It was our first time, which can go one of two ways. . . though it almost always disappoints, no? Not so when it came to this pizza dough. It was buttery, flaky and perfectly hefty to hold up to the toppings of Tutta (pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, onions, black olives. . . hold the black olives). I don't generally order half of anything because if I'm going to do this, let's do this but we were advised that even the most ravenous would be satisfied and this is true. The whole place gets sexier as you keep eating, and drinking, and eating and chortling and getting to know your neighbors (it can be elbow-to-elbow). I think our pizza was made not just with the tangibles, but with a sweet crooning from the chef, loving pats to the dough and the tenderest flick of the finger to add the toppings.  We carried on, trying to neglect the patrons waiting because we just didn't want to leave. I tried everything; ordering tiramisu when the check had already come, bathroom trips, telling new jokes.

I've dined at this restaurant four times before - all four times we chose to customize our pizza.  I've dined in twice and ordered take-out twice.  A ""Half"" pizza feeds about two people very comfortably.  A ""Whole"" pizza still feeds about two people very comfortably.  ""What do you mean?"" you ask?  Well... once you start eating, you won't be able to stop.  The rectangular pizza served up by the folks at Pizza Rustica is THAT good!  Alas, I only have one stomach, and because of that, I had to stop after a few extra slices more than what I could handle. -----SERVICE:----- The owner of this restaurant is super-friendly!  He always gives recommendations when requested, but leaves the decision up to you in the end (never tries to upsell a pricier pie). The servers are quite nice as well.  How do I describe them without being too forward?  ... You know all of those romantic comedies in which the lead actress travels abroad to western Europe where she meets a dashing young man with longer hair, a constant 5 o'clock shadow, and a thick European accent; and then decides to quit her American life to move to Italy to spend the rest of her life with him while sipping wine in the countryside?  Yeah, well I've never seen one of those movies either... but, according to a friend of mine, that's exactly what the ""charming italian waiters"" of Pizza Rustica remind her of. (In case you took that the wrong way, she meant that as a good thing). Even though they get really busy at times, they usually get the food out pretty quickly.  Take-out never takes more than 20 minutes from order-to-pickup. ----PRICE:----- Consider this ""gourmet"" pizza.  Custom-order pizza is always more expensive than if you order one of their specials.  For a Whole pizza, expect to spend $25-$30 (serves 4-5). -----SEATING:----- There's a small amount of seating inside the restaurant and some outdoor seating that can be used during the weekend.  During Cubs games and Weekend Nights it gets really busy so you should call ahead to make a reservation.  They're opening a new restaurant across the street and so they should have a larger area to seat people. -----LOCATION:----- This spot is easy to get to.  There's plenty of metered street parking if you decide to come on an off-day for baseball.  Otherwise, just hop off the L at the Sheridan Red-Line stop and the restaurant is a block away. -----FINAL THOUGHTS:----- The pizza is delicious as pricey as your average gourmet pizza in Chicago The service is quick and the staff is courteous.

2012-01-03,4.0,"Pizza Rustica is, overall, a very good pizza place. Their pizzas exhibit a thin, crunchy but delicate crust with a fairly good wholesome taste. Of the three kinds I had, I would say that I preferred the more exotic to the traditional margherita. None were bad, but the potato rosemary impressed me the most. The potatoes were sliced just right and their flavor came through while the rosemary helped augment the sauce and gave the cheese a bit more oomph. It seems that the toppings, red peppers in my case, take center stage dominating the pizza's overall flavor palette whereas the cheese and sauce play second string. I also tried the pineapple and ham pizza which was very good as well. The ingredients were fresh, and the ham was not overwhelming but in decently large chunks. I don't recommend coming here if you're rushed. Even with a nearly empty restaurant, it took quite a while to have our orders come out, but it's not that they were lazy.

I told him I felt it was dishonest to carry on in this manner, since the policy goal behind corkage fees is to allow restaurants to make money off alcohol people bring in if they serve alcohol, since the customers aren't ordering the restaurants alcohol, so it's only fair.   But not serving alcohol and then charging customers a corkage fee for bringing in their own when the restaurant is advertised as BYOB is just not an honest business practice.  I said it's like restaurant owners getting a liquor license just so they can charge corkage fees (which, if you think about it, doesn't make sense economically...  It costs more for a license than corkage fees could pay alone.  So this guy finds a loophole and serves liquor at ONE restaurant, then encourages liquor at the other by not serving it, but then charges corkage fees anyway.) In the end, I sucked it up and paid the extra money.  Like I said, I was with friends, and I felt like I was starting to make a fool of everyone by arguing so long. I want to emphasize - THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS.  Especially the rice balls.  I'm not rating the food, I'm rating the owner and his loophole scam.  He is making a lot of money off this practice in an illegal way.  I hope if you eat there, you don't BYOB so that you don't get ripped off.",-0.5611,0.787,0.101,0.113,0.520628078817734

2011-12-06,4.0,"So, somehow I missed the whole crust/texture deal about the pizza in the reviews. Reading for comprehension is my bag, y'all. But, we'll get to that. My take away from Pizza Rustica? I need to move to Europe. Like, tomorrow. I arrived right when the restaurant opened on a slow Monday late morning and had the place to myself. The owner came up to me, introduced himself, asked what I wanted and I replied I was waiting for a friend and would wait to order at that time. He poured me a glass of water and, rather than ignore me until my friend arrived, he struck up a conversation about Italy, America, lifestyles, what's important in life, what I'm looking for, and how to get it. It was incredibly illuminating. Aside from the whole 'economy might crash,' thought of living a simpler, more connected life was pretty appealing. And, it's always good to get a perspective that's greater than your own. As I pondered his words, my friend arrived and we commenced to the business of eating. When in Rome (heh)... you eat. A lot. As refreshing as water is, it has nothing on aranciata so I downed one of those. Actually, I sipped. I was freshly learned in the ways of savoring life. I sipped. The Rustica salad with artichoke, goat cheese and spinach was a revelation in simplicity. I don't know whether I was hungry or inspired, but I gobbled up every bite while attempting to concentrate on every chew. Savor. Wanting to taste the whole of this restaurant, we ordered a half Tutta: sausage, pepperoni, bleu cheese, olives, onions, and mushrooms. Once I got past the crust (more corn-mealy than I was expecting), I concentrated on the ingredients, sauce, and texture. Each bite was like a good conversation with a friend. Yes, the food was good and I'd gladly come back to enjoy more of it but it was the act of striking up a conversation with a stranger, getting to know someone and having the chance to connect with another human being on a basic level (food is a great equalizer) that makes me a fan. Life is short, it should be enjoyed. I know, I know. Pizza. Yes. But sitting down over a glass over water, waiting for a tardy friend and having the chance to gain perspective from someone who's enjoyed a meaningful way of life... it makes an impression on you.

2011-11-23,3.0,"There must be something wrong with me. If I had to bet (getting ready for Vegas here, minus 10 days yo)  I'd say that I miss the Italian-American gene. Because every time I go to a much celebrated green-white-red eatery I end up being underwhelmed, deflated like an old souffle forgotten for too long in the oven. That's: 1. sad 2. embarrassing. I almost feel guilty picking on my friends' favorites. Pizza Rustica wasn't that bad, really. But it wasn't the sigh-inducing, eye-rolling-behind-the-head experience that I thought it would be. I had dreamed of wood-burning cooked circles of delight, slightly charred, crunchy but chewy in the middle with strands of mozzarella stretching from here to the Mediterranean. My fault. I didn't take the name of the place literally. Pizza Rustica = pizza, Roman style. This pizza is cooked in long, rectangular baking pans and relatively thick. The crust is similar to that of  ""English muffin meets corn bread"", and the pizza is cooked in an electric oven. So here you go. The end result is not bad at all - but if Marilyn was singing that her heart belonged to daddy, mine belongs to a tanned Neapolitan pizzaiolo, hands dusted with flour, his intense blue eyes gazing lovingly at the ingredients he lavishly displays on his disk of dough, smiling like an angel. ............................. Even though Italian was heard and spoken in the open kitchen (two thumbs up) I wasn't enthralled, and our order of paperdelle all'amatriciana didn't totally save the day. The home-made pasta had just the right bite and was perfectly cooked, but the sauce was seriously lacking seasoning and the smoky, salty, delicious porky flavors of bacon/pancetta/guanciale that usually makes me go ""mamamia"" for hours on hand.  That being said the place is cute as a button (a small button that is about to expand on the other side of the street really soon) and you cannot beat free BYOB. It's busy, and their honoring reservations is a bit loose but I can wait for the apocalypse itself with a glass of wine in my hand.

2011-08-27,5.0,"Sometimes a restaurant succeeds without theatrical ambiance or ingratiating servers.  And do you want to know why that happens? Because it serves mircales.  The pizza at Pizza Rustica heals broken bones, does your taxes, and writes award winning novels. No seriously this is the best kept secret on the Northside. I only eat here in the summer, when I can sit at the sunsplashed sidewalk cafe in the afternoon.  This stretch of Sheridan is a little bit of gooey city goodness- all types of funky are walking by mixed in with your vanilla Lakeview peds. The three little restaurants on the corner are the only concession to serious gentrification- otherwise you can go have a Mexican pastry while you're waiting for your keys to get made at the Ace Hardware. The owner will frequently serve you and if you do you're fine, but it seems like its a famly run joint and sometimes you might be sitting out there a while.  You will forgive this instantly when you realize they are all inside cooking as well as serving, and what do you care? You're sitting outside in the sun. And most of the people working are Italian, with other Italians dropping by in the afternoon, so it makes you get into that laid back European vibe where perhaps you'll be encouraged to take a nap afterwards on a cot in the back. The salads are fresh and simple- dressed mostly with vinagrettes and justifying their price by one or two special ingredients. Today I realized my salad had fresh homemade croutons. One of those will make the one slice of pizza a perfectly filling lunch.  This is because its probably as much actual food as a personal pan from Pizza Hut, but note you will not have had a pizza like this before. It is fairly thin, and served on a little paddle, cut up into little cracker sized slices.  The crust which either has corn meal or butter in it- its so darn flakey, and has a strong flavor.  And even if the reason is more fat than you're normal yeast pizza crust it actually comes as a really light meal. The ingredients are lightly applied and I believe they are baking it to order. Quattro Staggione is by far my favorite. I'm always afraid it will be gone because for whatever reason this is a purely seasonal experience for me.  That's because the food is light summer fare, and its a nice quiet sidewalk eating experience.  I highly recommend this as a unique pizza experience in Chicago, even as we are firmly in the age of the brick oven pizza.",0.9951,0.844,0.136,0.021,0.5031419234360409

I'm sad to say that with the move to a bigger facility across the street it seems they have acquired a bigger, bloated more ""upscale"" head size! With 9 people in out party the consensus was: - owner was nowhere in sight.  There were however many employees racing around doing lots of nothing.  Too many for this place to be quaint or intimate anymore.  Last year it was the owner and I believe his nephew? - It looks like they replaced the standard deck oven (big flat pizza making oven) with a multi-layer bread oven.  Result:  flat boring crust, not even remotely what it used to be.   - flavor:  again, the crust is not even close to last year.  The toppings are also very skimpy and near flavorless.  What have they done? Upside?: Still the best Caesar salad we've had anywhere.  I guess that's something.

We ordered several Caesar salads and I have to say they were hands down the best I've ever had. I'd go there for the Caesar alone. We ordered several pizzas. General impression: perfect perfect crust. A blend between a thin Neapolitan and a butter crust. Thin but not like a cracker and buttery crisp. The flavor of the dough was pronounced. Specifics: Margherita, fresh, so fresh in fact that the basil was picked out of thier garden minutes before serving. Tropicale: Ham & Pineapple w/ Hot Giardiniera! Fantastic. Must have used some kind of Italian ham because this was way better than any version of this combo I've ever had. Pepperoni: Fantastic, the pepperoni and cheese were distinct. Plain cheese: favorite of the table. We also ordered one peice of Homemade Panna Cotta. I'll just say my favorite dessert (Creme Brulee) just got bumped. This stuff was sublime.

I did your classic Caprese, and it was perfect.  My boyfriend and friend each got the Cesear, one with chicken, one without, and it looked fantastic.  The croutons were amazing, which is always what makes a salad for me.  My other friend got the Minestrone soup, and he said that he had NEVER had a better cup of Minestrone, and it did look DAMN good.  Huge cuts of veggies, and a bit of cheese on top.  Now mind you the four of us had been at the pool all day and had barely eaten, so I don't know if that has anything to do with how delicious we thought everything was!

This place is always busy and I would call it Lakeview's little secret.  Can't say anything bad about them.  Highly recommend.,0.9809,0.642,0.334,0.024,0.7113750352211888
2011-07-28,1.0,"It really pains me to write this review because the food there is really good. The pizza tutta is amazing as is the veggie pizza but sadly the customer service falls beyond short. As a frequent customer, I ordered delivery and was told it would be an hour, time, which normal.  After an hour and a half of waiting I called to ask if the pizza was coming and I was told the driver was on his way. I live maybe 5 minutes away, 10 if traffic is bad but that is pushing it. After almost 2 hours I called again thinking, they either got lost or forgot our order. To say the manager was rude is the understatement of the year. He started yelling at me that everyone was ordering delivery that night and he was going to cancel my order to shut me up. I was so taken aback that his idea of customer service is to yell at a paying customer for waiting 2 hours for pizza that I didn't know what to say. He continued to yell at me, so I canceled the order and promised him I would not be ordering from there again. Honestly the food is good, but not good enough to put up with such rude and crass behavior. Learn how to treat your customers with respect and maybe you will be able to keep them.",0.6223,0.797,0.109,0.094,0.5671296296296295

2011-06-20,4.0,"I live right down the street from Pizza Rustica, but I had never stopped in until yesterday. Sure, I'd passed by many a time and watched longingly as other diners enjoying their pizza out on the patio and smelled the tempting aromas waft past my nostrils, but there was always some other pressing matter at hand that pulled me away from experiencing this pizza deliciousness. Yesterday, however, my friend Andy and I were on a mission for pizza. After driving around Wrigleyville for what seemed like forever trying to find parking so we could get a slice at Ian's, I remembered Pizza Rustica's ample parking and mouth-watering scents, so we took a short detour to Sheridan and Dakin to fulfill our pizza craving. By the time Andy and I arrived at Pizza Rustica, I was hungry enough to eat my own arm, and thus rather impatient. The rudeness of our waiter in these crucial first moments of our dining experience is what lost Pizza Rustica a star in my book. It took several minutes after we were seated for us to even get menus, much less acknowledgement from the three waitstaff chatting right next to us. I saw some other customers enjoying fresh bread with their meals, but when I asked our server if I could get a bread basket before our pizza came out, he told me that I could only have one if I ordered a full meal. I told him I would pay extra for it, and he still said no. Okay, I guess the bread is reserved for the higher-paying customers. I ended up ordering their bruschetta instead- yummy Italian bread piled with delicious tomatoes, basil, olives, and capers. The only drawback was that the order only came with four small pieces. My annoyance faded when the pizza came out. Andy and I ordered a half-pizza, which was more than enough for both of us. The crust was perfect- tender and chewy with lightly crispy edges and bubbly melted cheese. I had spinach and artichoke hearts on my half, which was absolutely amazing! Andy got sausage, and while he didn't care for the flavor of the sausage they used, he still loved the pizza. I will definitely return here when my next pizza craving hits!",0.9954,0.781,0.172,0.047,0.5363627564847078
2011-06-14,5.0,"I hadn't been in probably two years when I went back just recently, and I was so happy to find that Pizza Rustica is still as great as ever. The pizza is top notch and I realized on this most recent visit, that it's all in the crust. It's thin, but not neapolitan style cracker thin. And my guess is they must baste the crust with butter before cooking because it comes out so perfectly golden with a little crisp on the outside. I really can't even describe it justly - you just have to go and sample for yourself! I also love that they do not skimp on the toppings. You order a pizza with mushrooms, and there's handfuls of mushrooms. You want fresh tomatoes? You'll get fresh tomatoes in abundance on every slice. I hate when places go skimpy on the toppings - that is not the case here.  The service is still good and it's still BYOB (there is a small corkage fee). It's a small space so I recommend going early so that you can have a leisurely dining experience without feeling like you should hurry up and eat to vacate your table for the people that are always waiting after about 7 o'clock.",0.9813,0.798,0.161,0.041,0.49166666666666664

I ordered a Margarita pizza and cheesy garlic bread and was very pleased with my meal. I am always leery about margarita pizzas because sometimes you get a pizza with chunks of cheese and loads of garnish but this wasn't the case. They pair all the ingredients well and the pizza tastes really fresh. The crust is my favorite part...there's something really unique about it - absolutely compliments the pizza. There's a little garlic and olive oil in the dough, I think - yum.  Admittedly, the cheesy garlic bread was just so-so (large chunks of garlic, which was a little overwhelming), but overall not so bad.  Delivery took a solid hour, if not a little more.

2011-05-10,4.0,"Wow, what took me so long to finally try Pizza Rustica?  I took VBM* here last night for Mother's Day. Even though I busted my ass cooking brunch for my entire family on Sunday, I thought it would be nice if just the two of us had our own Mother's Day dinner together. After looking at the menu and coming across so many great reviews, I knew both of us would enjoy it.  Street parking was easy to come by, which is always a bonus, and they're open on Mondays, another win in my book.  The place is on the small side, but it's very charming. We were greeted immediately by our server, who was very sweet and welcoming, and given menus. Both Mom and I were surprised at how extensive the menu was, given that the kitchen looked to be tiny and didn't have a large staff.  In addition to pizza, they have sandwiches, salads, pasta, as well as a few meat, chicken and fish specials. We didn't realize it was BYOB and didn't come prepared, but it turned out to be fine as we had more than our fair share of mimosas the day before anyway, so we each had a San Pellegrino limonata (pretty much the best soda ever).  We started with a caprese salad, which is always one of my favorites, particularly when it's done this well. This version included some greens on the side and the whole thing was drizzled with balsamic vinegar and a touch of pesto. Even though the tomatoes could have been a touch riper, it was still a first-rate caprese.  We moved on to ordering pizza. I grew giddy with delight at the fact that you can customize not just a whole pizza, but individual slices! We both chose a slice of the potato rosemary pizza and Mom also ordered a slice with all of her favorite veggies. I decided to go for broke and get a half pizza so I'd have plenty of leftovers for the upcoming week. I went a little overboard adding ingredients, but they all sounded too good to pass up.  Our pizza arrived and I had to remind our server that I only ordered a half pizza, to which she clarified that it was, in fact, only a half pizza. Jiminy Christmas, this pizza was huge!  And it was delicious. The crust was crunchy, and the toppings were fresh and plentiful. How can you go wrong with artichoke, zucchini, tomato, basil and garlic on a pizza?  The only real bummer was dessert. After being informed they were out of panna cotta, we opted to try the tiramisu over the profiteroles (note to self: one should never pass up profiteroles). The tiramisu had no creamy and fluffy mascarpone filling - it was just mainly ladyfingers drizzled with chocolate. I didn't taste any hint of espresso either so it was kind of a disappointing dessert.  Overall, we really enjoyed Pizza Rustica. The place is very reasonable price-wise, but watch out when you order those extra toppings - they really add up.  I'm definitely coming back again and again, and I'll be sure and bring a bottle of wine next time. Corkage is only $1.75. This is a great place to go on a date or with a group of friends; we saw tables of both. Or even a place to take your mom.

2011-05-02,5.0,"Pizza Rustica. Where have you been all my life. If you grew up in Chicago like I did, Pizza was literally stuffed down your throat from the age of one. I ate so much pizza as a kid that I have peperoni coming out of my ears. To be honest, I'm kind of over the whole Chicago pizza scene. Then, a place like this comes along. PIzza Rustica is a wonderfully unique take on Pizza that I really enjoyed.   The Pizza is a giant rectangle of yummy goodness. It's mouthwateringly (Not a real word, just made it up) delicious and the main reason is the buttery crust. The crust has a buttery, garlic taste that's different from anything I've ever tasted. It transforms the pie from a ordinary pizza to a multiple orgasm on a plate.   The restaurant itself is quite small, so there was a bit of a wait to be seated. Once we had a place to rest our cheeks, our server did a fabulous job explaining the specials. The service was top notch. Another nice thing about Pizza Rustica is that it's a BYOB establishment.   Pizza Rustica is officially added to my list of best places to get your grub on in Chicago. It's right up there with Lou Malnotti's and Oven grinders as my favorite pies in Chicago.

When we were finally seated, we had a very pleasant server who explained the large selection of specials in his delightful Italian accent. Listen carefully, because it is loud in there and a bit hard to hear.   I don't know what Andy was thinking, but I heard him order a panini. This was a little shocking because we were seated right next to the pizza oven and I was sure the gorgeous pies emerging steaming hot and wonderfully fragrant would have sold him right away.  Luckily, I was able to convince him to change his order and I was able to sample one of the very best pizzas in town.  A fantastic, rich buttery crust that framed intensely fresh and flavourful ingredients.  If you dislike the ""cracker crust"" so often found in Chicago, or deep dish, then you will want to come here.  I ordered a special, which was the Pappardelle al Telefono. While it does sound like it should be ""pasta over a telephone"", in fact it was a wide noodle covered in an amazing tomato and wine sauce.

It was still tasty though. The chicken on top, on the other hand, was rubber. It was so overcooked it probably could have bounced if it had hit the floor. The chicken my friend had on her pizza was the same. I didn't say anything because at that point I was just plain hungry. When we got the bill, we couldn't figure out what the $1 ""appetizer special"" added to the very bottom of the bill. Know what that was? It's the extra $1 for the ravioli that they screwed up.

""..the most excellent pizza possible.""  ""Crust is lovely, buttery and crisp.""  "" Amazing pizza ... and it is BYOB.""  Yelpers seem to really love this place!  I saw that a reservation was recommended for parties over two because of the small amount of tables to accommodate, so I stalked the restaurant all morning Friday until they finally opened at noon.  NEWSFLASH!  They were NOT taking reservations (and may not be anymore), so... be prepared and give a call before you decide to head up there. We called around 7:30 and were told that the three of us could easily get it or wait a few minutes max.  However, in the time spent on the bus ride between Diversey and Wrigleyville, the restaurant suddenly became packed and we were told it would be anywhere from 15-30 minutes.  The place is fairly small and there really isn't any room to wait in the place so the waitress told us she would give a call when our table was ready and we headed across the street to the bar.  Sure enough, two minutes later after we ordered a pitcher of beer our table was ready.  We let them know that we just ordered beers and if we could come over in 15 minutes it would be great.  She obliged and held our table for us.  Score! We sat down by the window and were each handed a wooden plank of a menu.  Everything sounded delicious!  We started out with the Caesar and Caprese salads, which were both excellent and plenty for three people to share.  When we asked how many pizzas would be suitable for 3 people who were starving (and borderline drunk) our waitress told us two halves would be perfect.  A devout carnivore, I see almost no point in veggie pizza and find that most cooked, soggy vegetables are completely appalling.  We decided to order a margherita pizza and the intriguing rosemary potato pizza.  A giant slab of pizza came out shortly thereafter with 3 cutting boards to serve as our plates.  Potato pizza, eh?  Carb overload.  Delicious.  I want it every day!  The food reviews were true - crispy, delicious, buttery crust; excellent pizza; quite filling.  You are MISSING OUT if you have not tried this!!  Aside from being a devout carnivore I am a devout stuffed pizza fan, so finding a good thin crust pizza is a tough task.  I am not sure if it's the best pizza ever, but I won't mind trying it again and again to see! The three of us threw down $20 each which covered everything and left a sizable tip for our waitress.  I don't remember if our bill had a corkage fee on it or not, but after two bottles of wine and a pitcher of beer, would you either?

I ordered a cup of the minestrone and it was probably in the top 3 of the best cups of minestrone I have ever had. The broth was light and flavorful, perfectly salted. The vegetables were tender but still retained a lot of their flavor and freshness. And the parmesan cheese was the perfect finishing touch on the soup.  When the pizzas came out, we practically pounced on them. All in all, we had half of a rosemary potato pizza, half a Hawaiian pizza, a mushroom and olive pizza, and a margherita pizza. There were some leftovers but I definitely jumped on the chance to take those home! The crust held up well under all of the toppings so it wasn't soggy. It was crispy and flaky.

BYOB is very nice if it's just the two or four of you.  A good selection of non-pizza things, too which seemed very authentic. The big downside was the smell from the oven.  I don't mind it that much, but maybe the vents weren't working too well because the smoke from the ovens was a bit strong all night and I definitely needed to febreeze my jacket when I got home.",0.9102,0.864,0.11,0.025,0.539063492063492
2011-03-11,3.0,"2.5 stars. Eh, nothing spectacular. Yelpers...you've been letting me down with your reviews lately. I get very excited to try these restaurants with fabulous meals and then it turns out to be ""eh.""  Went here with 8 friends and learned a valuable lesson: 8 people cannot eat as much food as 12 people.  I'm actually going to blame this on our waiter since we desperately sought his advice on what to order since the menu was extremely vague and incorrect at describing the pizzas' size. We asked a few times how many pizzas we should order for 8 people and yet somehow we got 4 LARGE square pizzas that didn't even fit on our table. Yes, they literally had to set one on a waiter stand. This was what we were trying to avoid but he was obviously thinking of the final bill and not our overall happiness. I might have raised my review a tad too.  Disappointed with the waiter and his overall attitude and possible fake accent. It was a little obnoxious. And please, if you are a waiter, don't be a jerk and correct your customers pronunciation if it isn't really that big of a mistake. He made a point to correct our bruschetta and giardiniera pronunciation...really? Cause his wasn't much better. I know that was a stupid point to make, but it was definitely something that stood out to us and seemed to leave a bad taste in our mouth.   Food: Enjoyed the bruschetta since it was 3 different styles so the flavors were a little different. As for pizzas, we had the Margarita (nothing special to report even though we did have then add a few pieces of sausage on it too), The Tropicale (with giardiniera that was really just jalapeños...BIG DIFFERENCE Pizza Rustica!) and a couple of other too large and very plain pizzas.

The pizza was good but not great.  The crust and sauce were good, but I felt that the toppings were a bit lacking.  We ordered a margherita pizza with sausage, however I think there was only about 1-2 pieces of sauces on each slice.  Same with my favorite of the pizza's that we ordered - the Tropicale (with giardiniera).  There was maybe 1 pieces of pineapple and one piece of ham on each slice and the giardiniera ended up just being jalapenos.  While I REALLY liked the sweet, salt, and spice combination, it really had the potential to be DELICIOUS pizza and it ended up just being good. Also, while it is BYOB and takes reservations for big groups (we had a group of 7 that they were willing to accommodate), they charge a $2 corkage fee per person.  While $2 isn't horrible, it did end up adding $14 to our bill.

2010-06-24,4.0,"When people think Chicago, they think artery-clogging deep dish pizza covered in toppings. Despite growing accustomed to this pizza (and a big fan on occasion!), I prefer thin crust pizza with simple spices and flavor. Last night I went out with my friend who only eats pizza, literally. This gives me the opportunity to find out where the latest pizza place is and I stumbled on Pizza Rustica with outstanding reviews. Supposedly tornadoes were ripping through Chicago last night, but that can't hold me back from hitting the city and filling my pizza void. I was shocked to see that this little pizza joint was packed right after a storm. Fortunately, we found a table up against a wall. The restaurant is very compact but it's comfortable. I can't say I was too excited over the simple decorations, very typical Italian art for a pizza place. I'm kicking myself right now because Pizza Rustica is BYOB. Was I nuts? Why didn't I bring a bottle of wine? Or 5? This question will go unanswered until the next time I come in because I will definitely  return. The pizza was absolutely AMAZING. My friend I split a large pizza, half pepperoni and half cheese with basil (I told you I was simple!). The pizza arrived quickly despite how crowded the place was and only one server. I really can't get over the pizza. The crust was perfect. The cheese was tangy and flavorful. I had to eat my entire half of the pizza. I can't find a single complaint about the pizza, just spectacular!  Overall, I would say you have to check this out. The food is just awesome. I'm tempted to go back soon to try out their pastas.

The crust is out of this world. They make the pizza with fresh ingredients. It's thin crust pizza and topped with a variety of vegetables, meat, etc. They cook it in a pizza oven and it has just the right amount of toppings on it. Not too cheesy and kind of melts in your mouth.  You can order it by the slice, half pizza or whole pizza. Half pizza is the perfect size for 2 people.  Don't know if they still occasionally sell lobster, but I had it last time I was there. It was very reasonably priced and delicious.  I don't think you can go wrong with any kind of pizza that you buy there. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Don't park directly in front. It's a loading zone, but the signs are misleading. Looks legal to park. The staff is great about telling you, so that you don't get a ticket, but if they are really busy, you might get ticketed.

2009-09-17,2.0,"Lured by the promise of good, yet cheap pasta, we decided to try Pizza Rustica on N. Sheridan, just south of the Sheridan Redline stop.  And if we would have stuck to the original pasta plan, we might have an entirely different opinion of the place.  However, we were swayed by the sight of some pretty amazing looking brick oven pizzas on other patrons' tables and ended up being underwhelmed by our food. But let's start at the beginning.  The place has a nice warm, intimate atmosphere - a long, narrow dining room painted deep rust orange with all the usual Italian restaurant accents.  Our only issue was table size; it  barely fit our salads, drinks, salt/pepper and candle so when our main course arrived early it was awkward eating. I started out with a mixed greens salad topped with a light vinegarette dressing -- pretty standard stuff but a big (almost too big) portion. Clark origianlly ordered minestrone soup for a starter, but the restaurant had already run out although it was only the beginning of dinner rush.  So he tried a Caprese salad instead. That definitely turned out to be a solid back-up choice -- good sized slices of tomato with big hunks of well marinated mozzeralla, which dressed up my salad nicely too. So while we were still dealing with the salads our margerhita pizza arrived forcing us to hurry up and suck down the last of the apeptizers just to make room on the small table.  The best part about the pizza was defintely the presentation; it was served on a rectangular wooden serving paddle and we were given minature versions of the serving paddle (with a wax paper liner) to eat our pizza on. As we mentioned earlier, we were hit with the regret of not ordering the pasta dish, right away. After only a few bites we noticed there was close to no sauce between the cheese and the bread, making the thin dough too soft and spongy, from the cheese grease saturated the bread.  Nothing was wrong with the flavor or anything, but it made the texture of the crust somewhat mushy; we think if there were more sauce, then it would have prevented the grease from ""spongify-ing"" the bread. If there was one thing this pizza needed more of, it was -- something, anything that added more flavor... PLEASE! To add insult to injury, as we were getting our pizza remains boxed up (we can always dunk the leftovers in Ragu) the table next to us got a couple of yummy lookng pasta dishes delivered.  We briefly discussed coming back to give the pasta a try. But given that table envy is what got us into the pizza mess in the first place, we can't quite decide if we should return for the pasta dishes or if it's another case of something looking better than it tastes. Overall we spent $32 (including tip), which took us by surprise -- evidently, while the pizza was cheap the salads aren't.  Our feeling?  We could have taken that cash and gotten two good meals (ok, maybe one and half) elsewhere.

2009-07-12,3.0,"A few friends and I visited Pizza Rustica to celebrate reaching my 10% weight loss goal for Weight Watchers (I know, celebrating weight loss with food? kind of silly).  I called about 10 minutes before we arrived just to see if we'd be able to sit a party of eight (or at least warn them that we were arriving shortly) and they had no problem accommodating - they even had a table ready for us when we arrived!  I was very impressed.   However, it was insanely hot inside the restaurant.  By the time mid-June rolls around, you should be ready to put on the air when it reaches 90 in the afternoon.  The outdoor patio was full (of course) so we had to sit inside and it was pretty uncomfortable.  I began with the Caprese salad and it was average.  I could definitely recreate the same thing at my house, so it was nothing super special.  The portion was a great size, though, because three of us were able to split it.   We moved on to a pasta (again, shared) and decided to go with tortelini in marinara sauce.  The pasta was pretty good - I really liked the light marinara sauce as opposed to a very heavy, meat-laden sauce.  Other than the sauce, though, pretty average.  And then we had the pizza... it left something to be desired.  I agree with Michaelia F. when she says that the crust was super buttery for some of the toppings.  I enjoy that kind of crust (Pizza Metro does it the best) but some kinds of light, airy pizza just don't belong on that kind of crust.  The margarita was OK - nothing to write home about but I liked the rosemary potato.  I will give props to the restaurant for having a menu that strays from traditional pizza joints.  I like that they don't just have cheese with a standard array of toppings, so keep thinking up a different menu.   Oh, by the way, Pizza Rustica needs to do away with its $1.75/person corkage fee, especially since some members of my party didn't drink.  I don't think anyone should be forced to pay a corkage fee, especially if they do not drink.  Oh, and corkage fees are technically illegal, so stop charging so much for a person to come in and have some BYOB.  I am not happy about that and I really think it's kind of tacky to charge so much.  But, the place was good enough to get me to come back and give the pizza another try.",0.9521,0.802,0.123,0.075,0.589995421245421

I came here last night with a party of 8, and we were running a little late, so when we walked in and saw half our party already sitting, I was impressed. They had already set out wine glasses for us, and the server didn't blink an eye towards our six bottles of wine and two large-ish beers. Nice.  They have really nice patio seating, but we sat inside, and it was kind of disgusting. The place was pretty nice looking, nice tablecloths and bright, fun room.  And it was approximately 85 degrees in there. It was actually hotter inside than it was out. I'm not a big fan of wiping sweat off my brow when I'm eating, and this was gross. No air conditioning on the summer's first hot day?  Really? Ick.  We ordered a couple salads, a pasta, and three half pizzas to share. I only tried the mista salad, and it was perfectly fine (really boring, but fine):  mixed greens, balsamic vinaigrette. I only had a bite of the pasta, so I won't comment on that one. The pizza? Eh. It was OK. I tend to judge pizza places by their margarita pizzas--it's such a simple dish, but so easy to screw up. I was not a fan of the buttery crust, which overpowered the delicate flavors of the margarita pizza. The flavors of the potato and rosemary pizza, though it was starch overload, held up much better to the rich crust. The four seasons pizza was OK, but the pieces were cut really small, so you never really got all four toppings on one piece.   Service was really good, and getting out for $15/head with alcohol and tip was pretty nice too.

2009-05-28,1.0,"I hate to break with the crowd, but I must disagree with the other reviewers here. I went to Pizza Rustica a few weeks ago with two girlfriends. Not impressed. Why?  1) We had an 8:30pm reservation on a Saturday night. Arrived and the place was packed. The young Italian waiter informs me that he cannot seat us and that a table will not be available inside, or within the ""designated"" outdoor seating area, for another hour. ""An hour? Even with a reservation?,"" I ask him, clearly shocked. He shrugs and smiles. ""I wonder what the point was of making a reservation,"" I think to myself. But the waiter wants to squeeze us in, I suppose to get as much business as possible. So he goes into a back room, grabs two flimsy tables and places them outside of the designated seating area for the restaurant...in other words, he wants us to sit over by the parking meters, on the other side of the sidewalk, practically in the street. There are no other tables over there. I have never seen a restaurant do this before, and it feels slightly shady. We don't feel comfortable with this and tell him that we'd rather just wait for a seat inside (it looks like it's going to rain outside, and we are all alone outside on the street while the other al fresco diners are under an awning in a designated area). Yet he insists we sit there. Interesting...So we sit down. Alone. In the street.  2) Pizza did not taste good. Different, yes. But not ""good"" different. Didn't care for the crust at all. Guess I am just more of a traditional Napoleon-style pizza kind of gal. Plus, we were sitting outside in the cold so the cheese on the pizza was freezing cold and hard within a matter of minutes. My friend hated her soup and couldn't eat it.  3) Service was slow. Probably because the place was packed, but also because they were seating people like us in the street so as to get as much business as possible for the night. This was reflected in the service quality. Hint: Do not seat more people than you can serve in a reasonable time. Our waiter was very polite, but was never there when we needed him.  4) Bathroom. Who cares, right? Well, no. When you gotta go, you gotta go. My friends went to use the ladies room only to find it dirty and the one and only toilet clogged.

That's right!) are my two favorites.  You just can't go wrong with whatever your choice may be and they're only $3 a slice (which is equal to 6 little squares, a bang for your buck!).  Their crust is the most perfect pizza crust in the city!  It's perfectly crispy and crunchy, yet not overly hard or soft.

The crust is pretty soggy, and either it wasn't cut properly, or as I am led to believe that soggy pizza crust is just something that's hard to cut. Let's be honest, Chicago is a deep dish pizza town, we all know that, kids. But, if you're going to give me thin crust, it needs to be thin thin and crispy crispy. Anything else is just unacceptable.  While I do give Rustica credit for uniqueness as far as pizzas like the garbage pizza with blue cheese, the structure of the pie just falls a bit short in my opinion.

2007-12-25,3.0,"The reviews so far from other Yelpers have been pretty much right on the money.  I think that the place appeals to the typical resident (myself included) who like enjoy dining out as a break from the daily norms, but seek a good valu at the same time..  Pizza Rustica is it -- decent enough ambiance for a good six-pack or inexpensive wine with about $12-per-person price range for very good pizzas and no-frills pasta dishes. Their pizzas are about $12 range for pan large enough for 2-3 people, and most of their pasta dishes are at $10 range.  Their daily specials seem to be more ambitious takes, but sadly, I've yet to try them -- the $16-18 range pushes the limit of being ""good bargain"" in terms of the price range.  I always share a pan of Quattro Stagioni and Lasagna with my wife, and we usually end up taking home leftovers. My only gripe for the pizza is that their pizza tends to be a bit heavy on the cheese -- it tastes fresh (and my wife has no gripes on their cheese portion), but if you typically prefer more sauce and less cheese on your pizza orders, you might consider asking them to go easy on it.",0.9838,0.81,0.162,0.028,0.5383087027914615

2007-10-22,4.0,"I've lived a short distance from Pizza Rustica for some time, but always forgot about this little pocket of tucked-away restaurants (including Rick's and Tac Quick) when picking a place to eat. Finally pulled the trigger, and boy am I glad we tried it. The place is small (with little wiggle room for larger parties) with outdoor seating and warm decor. The menu offers simple pastas and thin pizzas, both of which are excellent. The pizza can be ordered in a variety of sizes- chances are, the portion you order will be too much. The prices are extremely affordable. Pizza can be ordered in smaller portions for as little as a couple bucks... and as stated above... the 'little' portion isn't even all that little. Lots of pasta options for well under 10, though what you're getting would typically be worth more than that at any comparable restaurant. BYOB only adds to the value (if i recall, a small corkage fee). Service has been okay. This place is a little gem. (Note: it is on Sheridan, but everytime I've met guests there, they have gotten lost as it is admittedly a little confusing. Sheridan cuts over from the lake and takes over where Sheffield is, and runs north there. So you can find this restaurant just south of Irving park at the 'el' station, or if you continue north from sheffield and addison.)",0.95,0.872,0.098,0.03,0.5252551020408163

It was pretty bland and just tasted like a slab of potatoes on crust. Boo! My g/f is out of town so I got a pepperoni to watch the bears game. I was kinda disappointed again. It reminded me of this old school frozen pizza I had as a kid. Can't remember the name but this pizza should be better then that! I ordered carryout and the lady said come in 10 minutes.

And I love when I can have 4 pieces of pizza and really only eat as much as if I had once slice of Domino's. Fools me into thinking I am really indulging.  We also ordered the artichoke tortellini with alfredo sauce. If it were physically possible to make love to a pasta - this would be the one!  The artichoke had a great flavor and the pasta tasted homemade, and the sauce! Oh the sauce - light, creamy and cheesey with a hint of garlic. Wow.  I will definately be ordering from, or dining in at, Pizza Rustica again. It's very inexpensive and the portions are large for the price. Everything is clearly made of fresh, quality ingredients.

2007-07-26,3.0,"We set up shop at one of the four-seaters in the patio, arranging a six-pack of Mothership Wit (USDA-certified organic, by Fat Tire brewer New Belgium) and five bottles of Goose strategically to allow room for a lot of Venetian-style pizza. At first we weren't sure if our waitress was taking a siesta break or what, since we sat there drinking beer for about 40 minutes before I went in to tell her we were ready to order. (She only truly snapped out of it when Maria poked her in the butt to ask for some water.) But it was a buona sera and perfect for sidewalk sitting, so we patiently awaited the gondola that will take us through the tunnel of love to the piazza of pizza pizzazz.  Beth, Maria and I each ordered half a pizza (pizzas came in rectangles and cut into squares) -- the pasta entrees sounded magnificent, but it is Pizzapalooza, not Pastapalooza. Beth ordered the Papate Rosmarino (thinly sliced potatoes seasoned with rosemary) and you must be thinking, potatoes on pizza? Where is Dr. Atkins? But Beth took one bite and sighed, ""That's amore,"" and thank god for polygamy when it comes to pizza, because we all stole one bite of it as well and also muttered sweet nothings in the same breath.  I ordered the Quattro Stagioni (tomatoes, artichoke, mushrooms and ham), which means four seasons. I was excited about all types of seasons, particularly the Cubs' winning one so far, but currently the aroma of freshly baked goodness was the wildcard leader. And for the evening's ""when the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie"" moment, Maria's Tutta Pizza (sausage, pepperoni, mushroom, onion, black olives and blue cheese) -- or garbage pizza. The thing was a honking slab of everything that could make a pizza taste good; it looked like a pile of compost, but my mom always said to never judge a pizza by its toppings.  The pizzas were served in an unusual fashion -- Beth's pizza came stag on a wooden paddle, while Maria's and mine arrived side by side on a larger plastic tray (what, they ran out of wood?). We were given little wooden paddles as plates, with a piece of tracing paper to blot off the grease. Grease. It's the word. These pizzas were tasty, and I don't believe I've ever had pizza where the crust tasted like a cross between fillo pastry, biscuit and baked dough. It was crispy, but it almost tasted fried because it was so buttery (being a crust fan, I'm that person who grabs all the end pieces for the crisp). The pizzas were also cheesy, resembling the American method of pizza prep, but not over-indulgent, so other toppings such as artichoke, mushrooms, ham, black olives, potatoes and rosemary still hogged the spotlight. So I must say, a little over the top for me, but I can't really complain about the investment in the good stuff, since the overall taste was not compromised. Although my caloric intake for the day was. Here's a good way of looking at it: if I was eating a garbage pizza from Giordano's, I would be throwing up in the trash after two slices. Since we'd already gone too far, there was no meeting halfway when it came to dessert. We ordered the tiramisu (an Italian must, a Pizza Rustica bust), the panna cotta (looked like a slab of undercooked tofu, tasted like paradiso), and the special, a cake layered with marmalade and topped off with chocolate (orange you full already?). Together with the Cubs leading 7-1 in the late innings at Busch Stadium, it was a sweet ending to a savoury evening... particularly since dinner came out to just $18 per person, including tip.",0.9973,0.866,0.124,0.011,0.4919763107263108

I get around!).   I'm not a big fan of typical Chicago style pizzas, eating pizza with a fork has always felt wrong to me.  Pizza Rustica's is square, medium thick, with a buttery delicious crust.  I've had some of the pasta dishes as well, they are quite good.  My friend had a Caesar salad and liked it.  Haven't tried the desserts, I'm more of a coffee after a meal eater.   Did the delivery one time, it was fast, although the crust was a little over crisp (had to have at least one negative!).  It was for a group of Patty's revelers though, so no one complained, drunks usually don't (except that one girl, dude, what's up with her?)  There are coupons on the website, haven't used one, but there they are.  It also recommends putting the pizza in the oven for a bit at 350 to, um, re-butterize the crust I guess? BYOB is always cool, I don't mind paying for my drinks but getting to choose from a liquor store selection based on my mood is much nicer.  And cheaper!   I finished with an espresso during my last visit, it was good, although I don't consider myself an expert. The staff is really friendly (and mostly actual Italians, not American-Italian or Italian-American or whatever people are using these days.  My book writes like this: speak the language or don't claim the heritage).  The owner Stefano is super friendly.  He told me his Mom came for a visit once and they cooked at the restaurant together, how sweet is that?   The location is perfect in my book.  Right off the Red Line at Sheridan on a quieter street.  Simple decor without trying too hard.  Painting for purchase on the walls (the website will tell you about the featured artist, oh, and nice website).  Clean restrooms, covered outdoor seating.  Hasn't been busy when I've been there, but never been during the typical busy times.   Something negative to balance the review, hmmmm.......I once walked into a tree trying to hail a cab after leaving here.  Headache for the rest of the night.  I'll accept responsibility for looking backwards while walking forwards on a poorly lit street, but I will blame the cabbie with the numbers lit carrying customers.  If not for him I would have caught a cab right out front.  But seriousmheaw, I guess the crispy crust on the delivery and the corkage fee (albeit a standard practice) All in all, I think other reviewers have been unfair, this restaurant is at least a four.  It's a five in my book and is currently the Undisputed Champion of My Favorite Restaurants.",0.9955,0.804,0.155,0.04,0.5118235930735929
