2017-09-03,5.0,"The name Artopolis means ""bread town."" They are known for their house made artisan breads - so you can imagine how lovely it smells when you first step foot into this mesmerizing Greek cafe.  They state that they aim to bring an authentic European vibe to Chicago. The space is a loft style with an open kitchen. The front windows open to the street so you can really feel like a part of what's happening both on the street, and inside the cafe.  I just love it here.   In the neighborhood for the Greektown street festival (Taste of Greektown), and after having walked six miles from Lakeview East to Greektown - we were ready to enjoy all the food this neighborhood festival had to offer.  After grubbing at some seriously stellar food stands (grilled octopus and calamari from Santorini, grilled chicken kabob and Greek salad from Roditys), we decided to wander into Artopolis for dessert.  We were immediately greeted and welcomed inside, and I fell in love with the casual vibe and unique aesthetic.  The place was packed, but so chill. All different generations of people were enjoying coffee and desserts, and the staff were attentive and warm.  We got in line for the bakery case and ordered the tiramisu and chocolate eclair.  What I appreciate most is that both desserts tasted so fresh.  Both were not particularly sweet, so we could really taste the different flavors of the ingredients. I think they truly have done well at staying true to their European identity.  From the staff, to the aesthetic, to the food - I can easily say this is my favorite bakery in Chicago.  There are Greek desserts here that I've never seen or heard of before, and cannot wait to return to enjoy.   I absolutely love grabbing dinner at one spot, and wandering through the neighborhood to another spot for dessert.  Greektown is the perfect neighborhood to do this in.   I highly recommend you stop at Artopolis for dessert when you are hanging out in Greektown.",0.9956,0.792,0.186,0.021,0.5353703703703704

I've frequented this place at least ten times and it's always been the perfect atmosphere for long catch-ups over some yummy foods/drinks. They have a wide variety of desserts that are all meticulously made and satisfies your sweet tooth. I've tried the Tiramisu, Yogurt Mousse, Symphony...etc--no complaints so far. These desserts are on the heavier side though so I tend to like to share them with friends.  They have more selection options for meals--I've had their Chicken Farfelle, Chicken Kebob and tried their Artopitas (homemade savory pies). They've all been very well made and I'm looking forward to trying more things on the menu.  Service is also A+, every server I've encountered has been very accomodating and nice.

Well what disaster that turned into. My boyfriend was so excited to check out the cakes in the window so when we got up to the ramp a host greeted us and said how many. We said we where just here for dessert and the man insisted we sit down. My boyfriend told him okay yes put us over there but I would like to look. Not understanding how this works apparently...my boyfriend ordered our desserts at the counter like u would at most bakeries the lady boxed it and gave him silverware and then we went and sat at the table where we where greeted by the waitress and we ordered some coffee. As my boyfriend pulled out our desserts and started to take the first couple of bits the ""owner"" ran over and yelled at us, ""you can't eat that here! You ordered it to go!!!!"" And then also explained that it's the waitresses job and we are occupying her table. Well we just spent $20.00 bucks at the bakery counter and sat down and ordered coffee???? Are we not paying customers?!?! I was soo annoyed and publicly shamed in the cafe I was fuming. At that point I just wanted to leave. We couldn't believe what had just happened. After a few minutes and the waitress bringing over our coffee my boyfriend walked up to talk to the manager again telling him that was uncalled for and that he had upset me and that he should probably apologize to me for being so rude. So they walked over to me together and instead of fixing the problem continued to argue with my boyfriend saying he my boyfriend was wrong but he wanted him to apologize but he is right but he is just doing it to make him happy and blah blah blah. I stopped the manager and said instead of shutting your mouth and saying I am sorry we had a misunderstanding why don't I run and get you guys a plate and you can sit and enjoy ur desserts. HELLO WE ARE PAYING CUSTOMERS! he did not do that. I was so annoyed we threw money down on the table and walked out.

Before we get further, I want to note to my fellow Yelpers that I am a European mut with Turkish upbringing. As such, the foods served at Artopolis are things I have been having my entire life. I want it known that this place satisfies me daily with the half soup-half salad order for $9.76 and kind gentlemen who allow me to take extra lemon for their lemon chicken rice soup without staring at me weird. I believe Artopolis's owners are from Northern Greece and despite their knowledge of me being Turkish, they have been kind and very willing to give me all of the kataifi I can fit into my body. We are currently at the stage where I am being given money by colleagues who are swamped so that I can run down and grab some katifi for them.

While I mostly stick to their salad selection, their soups are pretty good, too! I also recommend their artopitas, which never disappoint.  Their bakery is wonderful, but a little over-priced. They charge by the pound for their artisan cookies, which can add up. I also got a cheesecake for a colleague's birthday, and while it was DELICIOUS, it was very expensive for a 9 inch cheesecake.

I wish I remembered the names for all the desserts because there were some standout hits and some that were good but not amazing.  Most of the Greek yogurt based desserts were good but our favorite was the traditional dessert they had at the bottom of the case,  For the life of me I do not remember the name but it is in the top right of the picture below.

I've never been to a restaurant where I felt like our presence and ordering food was a burden to the server before interacting with him or her upon sitting down. If you're going to give a dirty look twice before even talking to us and getting our orders, at least don't do it RIGHT in front of our faces? The best way I can describe her look is when a person's eyes widen briefly while looking to the side (almost like an ""ummm okay..."" expression with emphasis on the ellipsis). Anyway, we ordered the Mango Yogurt Mousse, Hazelnut Praline, and Tiramisu. They were all very delicious and what brought my rating up. My favorite is of course the Hazelnut Praline because I'm a fan of hazelnut anything. None of the desserts were too sweet, but they tasted fresh and satisfying. When the server brought our desserts over, I cleared the small table to the best of my ability to allow her to place the plates down in the middle since we were sharing. While there was enough room to put the desserts in the middle, she told us that there wasn't enough room.

The cashier said we cannot eat in because we had already ordered to go. She said she would give us our money back and we could order from the table. After a couple of minutes of stupidity I said just give us the money back and we left. We own a restaurant business too and would never treat a customer like this.

2016-09-06,1.0,"This place was hoppin' on a Saturday night, and I was so excited to try it out for post-dinner dessert and coffee, but was unfortunately horribly disappointed. I probably couldn't have had a worse experience...I will preface by saying about 75% of the reason for the awful experience was due to the service. I usually try not to comment on service in my Yelp reviews, but the service we received was so awful and horrendous that I can't ignore it.  I'll set the scene for you: There were about 9 of us at 10 PM on a Saturday. Greektown was bustling with people as it was also Taste of Greektown - there was live music, people dancing in the streets, and there was a great energy all around. Until we entered Artoplis...To begin, we had a bit of trouble finding a table for such a large group. We split up into two different tables, were kicked out of tables by servers, and then finally moved to a table that opened up thatwas large enough for all of us. During this time, the servers didn't approach us at all to ask what we wanted and even after we combined tables, we probably had to wait about 20 minutes before a server helped us, and the only reason they did is because we approached someone at the counter and asked if we could order.  When we ordered, we asked for waters all around and ordered about 6-7 desserts as well. The server came back with 9 bottles of Evian water...uh, if you're going to charge me for water and bring over water bottles, I would think that you would let me know ahead of time. Wouldn't that be more considerate? Also, don't you have Crystal Glacier like everyone else? Sorry, but I don't need to be snobby about my water... When the desserts came out, they actually looked delicious. We were extremely excited to devour everything. Of course there is a ""but"" though. When we ordered, someone ordered an almond baklava, but had asked the server to ensure that there was no egg in it because she had an egg allergy. So naturally, they could only eat it if it was eggless. When she confirmed again that it was eggless, the server said she would check, and another server/manager(?) came back and said that it did have egg in it. Uh, then why did you bring it out? Didn't she ask you to check while she ordered it? So why didn't you? Also, they forgot to bring out one of the desserts that we had ordered and finally brought it out 15 minutes later once everyone else at the table had finished eating their dessert. And we were still charged for it... The desserts themselves were good, some better than others. Out of what I tried, I would definitely recommend the chocolate mousse, The Symphony, and the baklava. I ordered the Opera and was pretty disappointed with it - it was actually very dry and didn't have much flavor. Although the desserts were alright, I wouldn't return just because the service made the experience so awful. But if you do find yourself here, I will you patience and snarkiness to deal with the wait staff.",0.9358,0.818,0.103,0.079,0.6138416988416989

I went to Artopolis and waited by the pastries for several minutes to order (as there was no one by the drink counter) until finally an employee appeared at the drink counter. I then ordered a chai tea latte. The chai was scalding hot so I wanted to let it cool off for a few minutes and headed to Union Station. Upon finally cooling off I tried the chai latte and found that it was just boiling hot water with a little trace of cinnamon in there. I quickly headed to Starbucks and got a real chai tea latte, not just a cup of boiling hot water that I paid a few dollars for.

2016-06-16,4.0,"Artopolis is the best Greek cafe that you will find in this small subset of Chicago. Affordable, delicious, and opened until the dead of night? Yes please! I've been here twice: once for birthday drinks, and the other for an actual dinner meal. Artopolis is clearly known for their desserts, but don't let that prevent you from trying some of their drinks and savory dishes. Their cocktails are reasonably priced (less than $10 for most of them), strong, tasty, and overall a great deal. Their espresso cocktail was especially good. A great energy boost to your evening. During dinner, I ordered the Kasseri And Feta Pita with a side of pasta salad. The pita was baked to perfection and came with a blend of cheeses and mint. My plate was sprinkled with cilantro to really add to the presentation. If offered the choice, definitely go for the pasta salad. This penne side was amazing and tasty. For the dessert lovers, you can't go wrong with what I've had. The Mango Yogurt Mousse is light with just enough sweetness, and had great texture. The almond baklava was uber sweet, so be prepared. Each of these was less than $5 a piece, so definitely splurge! The food and ambiance at Artopolis is fantastic. Only major gripe is that service can be slow at times and it may be difficult to flag down your server.

The spanakopita, or spinach artopitas, was the most heavenly, buttery, savory pastry I've had as of yet. It was also surprisingly filling for under $6. (I didn't get the additional salad.) The flaky croissant outsides melt just enough with the generous spinach and feta filling. Not overpowering or gluttonously buttery. Also pleasantly not messy to eat; it doesn't fall apart, but holds together well, which I find to be a problem with any croissant-type pastry for me. Will be going back to try the other artopitas and pastries, but I might/will probably end up getting the spanakopita again. There's a bakery counter, meal corner (?), and bar.

One of my favorite places for dessert in Chicago is Artopolis in Greek Town. If you can't find what you like here, it probably doesn't exist (unless you're craving an ice cream concoction or a soufflé).   Whenever I'm having dinner on Halsted, I always try and talk my companions into stopping here afterwards for dessert and a cappuccino. My very favorite are the traditional Greek loukoumades. Small squishy balls of dough that have been fried, then covered in honey, nuts and cinammon. This is a generous dessert you'll definitely want to share. But Artopolis offers a lot more than desserts.There's an on-site bakery with artisan breads and rolls, and a full menu with salads, sandwiches, wood fired pizzas and a variety of Mediterranean foods. Some things I've tried are good, and some just average. It has a full bar. And almost everything is available for take-out.  No reservations, so I no longer have breakfast here weekends, when it's often packed. No table service for lunch except on weekends. And no free parking like at the other Greek restaurants on Halsted St. (I leave my car at the restaurant where I've had dinner when I come here just for dessert).",0.984,0.751,0.18,0.069,0.5511904761904763

I'm under the impression that all the food is pre-made and warmed up when it is ordered. The kitchen looks a bit like a cafeteria with all the vegetables already cut up and ready to go.  The chicken was crispy and juicy but bland. I wished that there was hot sauce to eat with it. I wasn't a big fan of the potato and vegetables that came with the Rigganatti--they were all a bit sour.

It's really confusing upon entering though because there's no sign indicating that some one seat us or we seat ourselves or what... But upon arrival, we just wanted some dessert and approach the counter because there's no sign indicating the seating situation. So when we talked to the counter girl, since we wanted to have dessert there, we would have to seat ourselves and someone would come take our order. But we were already ready to order so we had to wait awhile for a server to approach us. Then when someone took our order, we had to wait when the dessert we wanted was already in the counter glass but whatever we waited.  We finally got our dessert and it was pretty decent. I really enjoyed how moist the tiramisu was but I wish there was more cake in it and not just the other filling stuff but nonetheless it was still very tasty.

I'm sure they don't speak a word Greek even though they like to play a sophisticated Athenian radio station. I just have to say this: I was trying to guess why the girl was so rude for quite some time!. I came up with various thoughts. Maybe she thought I was a Greek sad looking for help? I'm trying to excuse them now but yes the truth is I do have the feeling that Greek Americans are not very friendly to Greeks that came to the US recently. That's not my case but I'm still trying to figure out why everybody else in the us treats me with proper customer service but not my ""own"" people. If they were.

They have three or four bakery cases when you walk in, all filled with amazing treats. Behind that there is a display of all of their fresh breads. I have yet to have anything bad here. Most recently, we loaded up on baklava, chocolate-raspberry mousse, lemon tarts, and cheesecakes. The chocolate-raspberry treats were delicious. They're covered in ganache and are so rich, you almost think you can't finish a piece. Then, of course, you do. The lemon tarts I think are my favorite. They are just the right amount of both sweet and tart, the filling is thick without being too much. The crust is super crunchy and really sweet, which is a nice contrast to the tart lemon curd. The cheesecake... Well I never got to try that because my dad ate all of it. I think that's a good sign. The baklava is textbook and delicious, with heavy doses of honey and nuts with flaky pastry.  I make a point now to come here whenever I'm in the neighborhood, and it's given me a reason to venture up to Greektown more often. I'd definitely recommend it.

Had $40 worth of Groupon to spend here with a friend and I knew it would be no issue using it up. My friend and I considered ordering alcoholic beverages, but then decided on soda and whatever this one guy near us was having which was a frappe, and I could choose the sweetness level. I chose lightly sweet and my friend joked about putting in some alcohol but the waitress completely ignored the statement as if it wasn't even a possibility, even though we were kind of serious about maybe adding some Kahlua or Bailey's. Guess not. My friend ordered a sandwich, which comes with a choice of pasta or potato. She wanted a side salad. No, not possible. Not even an apology- just a no substitution attitude- you can have only pasta or potato. Ok, let's go for the potato then. No nonsense here! I ordered the 5 cheese pizza. I expected a very thin crust, personal pizza situation with a thin layer of mozzarella with maybe a smattering of other cheeses, but instead received a very doughy crust, huge dinner plate full of very cheesy pizza, showing the four kinds of cheeses that went into it and a huge glop of goat cheese in the middle. I would be lucky if I even finished half and took the rest home. I wasn't just lucky, I was enjoying it. We also had dessert, needing to make up the Groupon total, and my tiramisu was delicious, light in texture, but heavy on espresso flavor. Perfection. Because I had 90 cents left over in the total, our waitress offered me a couple almond cookies to take home to make up for it. I very much appreciated that- usually the restaurants say nothing and let you waste the rest of the deal. Plus, the cookies were really good- crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and tasted like marzipan, which I love.

There is even some balcony seating if you want a view of the construction and traffic on the street. Truly charming restaurant though. You can grab meals or baked goods to go too. Prices are reasonable.  The artopitas are great and my fave is spanakopita. Full of spinach & feta baked in a savory puff pastry of sorts. I also had the rosemary potatoes which you can sub for a side. They were slow cooked for hours and have full seasonings. Easy to fill up a belly with just a few items.  The staff is also very kind and accommodating. Worth it for sure.,0.9803,0.785,0.215,0.0,0.5920138888888888
2014-12-19,2.0,"We popped in for a quick bite before a meeting, and it was... not quick. At 2:30 in the afternoon, this pleasant spot was dead, but service was ULTRA friendly and attentive. And while I loved the service and atmosphere, our rather simple order took way too long and the food was frankly just ok at best. For being in Greektown, my spinach pie was non traditional and not very good. The accompanying pasta salad was extremely bland and uninspired.  Not a bad place at all, but also not a destination if you're looking for solid Greek food. /////////////////////////////// EDIT: Someone named Spyros sent me a note at 3:30 am on Jan 4, 2014 Justin review is a bit wrong my friend Artopolis is a bakery and cafe,like the logo says,it is not a traditional Greek restaurant and their spinach pie is non traditional cause it is an artopita made like a spinach pie,it was voted third among all of the competitors in the whole country,i am very well aware of all that since i helped this place get to where it is and thank you for the compliments about the atmosphere and all but the stars are based on non traditional food !Not every store in Greek town is a Greek Taverna,sorry for the response it isn't personal but i am hoping you could perhaps rewrite your review as the stars bring out the quality of Artopolis actually really is,a bakery and a cafe!Happy new year!",0.9843,0.785,0.161,0.054,0.46843416999667004
2014-12-09,1.0,"I had a depressing and bizarre visit during a late lunch at Artopolis in August. Service was exceedingly slow, but our server seemed new and she was friendly, so I asked for the manager / owner to see if she could take some money off the bill. After I explained what happened to the owner, she refused to take any discount off the bill and told me to simply leave a $0 tip if I received bad service. Again, I tried telling her that the server should not be in trouble simply because the kitchen took forever to cook the meal, but she steadfastly refused. I told her, ""I'm not happy about paying this,"" went back to my table, paid the bill, and started walking out of the restaurant... when the OWNER CAME RUNNING AFTER ME and SCREAMED THAT SHE WOULD CALL THE COPS ON ME FOR NOT PAYING THE BILL!  Literally, the owner chased me out of the restaurant because I was not happy with the service (which was, like I said, exceedingly slow... as in, a 2 hour lunch). I can honestly say that has never happened to me before, and can laugh about it now.

A group of us 4 girls came in to grab coffee and desserts around 4 p.m. on a rainy Sunday afternoon. It was packed! We couldn't find a host so we looked at the delicious treats behind the window and the girls working there were so helpful with helping us choose what we wanted to eat! The mango dessert was suggested more than the white chocolate dessert but my friend who loves white chocolate got it and loved it. There were two macarons left and we got the pistachio and vanilla one. I am picky about macaron's so if you are too- this is where to get them! Since we weren't getting them to go- we had to order by table service but we just sat down on our own with a help of a hostess. When we got our waitress she was very friendly and took time with our order. I got a hot cocoa, my friend got the Americano, and my two other friends got the frappe in which they were able to choose if they wanted it sweet, medium sweet, or no sugar. They both choose sweet. We all loved our drinks from the taste, quality, and presentation. Temperature was perfect and we enjoyed talking and mingling in a loud- chatter environment,  cultured with decorations and ambiance, with a large crowd of people. Perfect for families, large groups, or a semi casual/romantic date. I would love coming in here after a good meal or for just coffee with a macaron.

Was kind of saddened to see Greek Coffee blacked out on the menu...so I went with a Iced Cafe Latte instead and split the galaktoboureko with my family. The galaktoboureko was interesting. It was a lemon custard wrapped in phyllo. We were surprised that it was brought out warm...which probably explains why the phyllo burnt on one end. First bite, pretty awesome. There was a good balance of textures from the flaky phyllo to the smooth lemony custard. But ultimately, we found the dessert to be much too sweet, from the added syrup they put on. And because we let it sit in the syrupy topping, it became ever more difficult to separate and eat.  The atmosphere within Artopolis was nice and laid back. The upstairs loft seemed mostly occupied by students from UIC, while the lower central seating area seemed occupied by tourists and 'regular' customers fraternizing with the staff. The staff really doesn't seem to mind if you sit hours on end either.

Sure, they have it, and several varieties to boot, but after I sampled the supercalafragalisticexpialidocious melomakarona and the angel trumpets died down, suffice it to say, I was hooked.  Don't misunderstand, the baklava here is very good, and again, the variety is also a wonderful thing, but my taste buds adore this melomakarona.   And what exactly is this tongue tripping magical dessert I am crushing on?  It is traditionally a Christmas cookie (but again, 5-stars to Artopolis for providing it year round).  Its primary ingredients are finely ground up walnuts, honey, olive oil, and everything else at the discretion of the baker. This cookie is oval shaped and moist, almost taking it into cake territory, but not quite.  The taste is like a very mild gingerbread.  To quote Candy Crush, (these cookies are) Divine!  I must always buy some when we're here.    Galaktoboureko is another favorite, and not because it is so fun to rattle off.  Like baklava, it is a phyllo pastry dessert. Unlike baklava, it incorporates lemon custard and is doused in orange syrup. A slice of this with some coffee or tea around 3-4pm will be sure to dispel any afternoon doldrums. While those are the standouts for me, the other cookies, tarts, and pastries at the Artopolis bakery counter are also quite good and should not be overlooked. There is a cafe portion too, but my palate has been faithful to another Greek restaurant up the street, when lunch is concerned.  On a slightly eclectic note, the shelves near the entry way with a variety of ouzo, evil eye charms, beads, and blown glass lamps are interesting to look over.",0.9931,0.763,0.186,0.052,0.5360897435897436

2014-06-04,3.0,"Most important question: What greek restaurant doesn't offer lamb? (When most of their items on their menu are lamb based.) Came here expecting delicious greek food as I'm a huge fan. The waitress was a bit snappy and seemed like she just wanted us to order and leave. We were offered a table by the host and when we decided we wanted to change, the waitress said that that table was for a specific number of people and we couldn't sit there. Alright that's understandable. However, after that, as I was about to place my order, she cut me off mid sentence saying they didn't have lamb so everything on the menu was either beef or chicken. What? On a busy weekend, running out of stock for an item that's mainly on your menu? Not good. Quite disappointed in our first time dining there. The food was okay not spectacular. And less than par server experience. The restaurant itself is a cute design, but I would most likely not go there again as I think we'd be able to find a better neighbor restaurant nearby.",0.8961,0.854,0.112,0.033,0.5384057971014492

They don't fry anything and everything is either baked or fried.  We got started with our drinks and I must say they have decent wine collection, they make their own bread and it was really fresh. Their cheese platters are really huge and their saganaki was also really tasty. This place also serves a lot of vegetarian dishes and their veg pizza are a must try.

2014-05-03,4.0,"Though our experience was a bit odd, I really have no regrets about coming to Artopolis. I was hungry, I had a wicked wine buzz, and I needed to chill out and soak up some of the booze with a bit of cheese. Make that, more cheese than any one person should consume in a week, let alone one sitting.  We were greeted right away on this sunny, warm Saturday afternoon. The placed wasn't packed but it was filling up. The hostess was nice enough to let us have our pick of where to sit (no shortage of options), so of course we chose the most annoying spot in the house on the second level by the staircase. I felt bad choosing it immediately after the idea of our server having to go up and down the flight of stairs popped into my head, but it wasn't like we were the only ones up there so I just went with it.  I was mega hungry so I new right away I wanted the saganaki kabobs and the stuffed grape leaves. Deep down I really just wanted standard saganaki, but this cafe doesn't do that... or at least if they do it isn't on the menu. Still- the kabobs were great, albeit a bit lite on the portion for the price (six 1-inch cubes with 2 lemon wedges and 2 dipping sauces). The grape leaves were delicious and I don't normally like grape leaves but something in my gut told me these would be good. I probably could've eaten 3 plates of them.  The one strange thing was that a guy dropped off our appetizers and we cleared a space on the table and said thank you, then about 30 seconds later our original server girl came over and asked what was wrong with our dishes. Neither of us understood and looked at her puzzled while responding with saying they look great. Then she got really defensive and said that we had just told the person who dropped off our food that we didn't order them. Cut to us looking even more puzzled than before and responding with, 'we didn't get any other food or say that. Maybe it was a different table?', then she kind of barked, 'no, it was you', at us in a pretty aggressive way. My partner and I were both pretty taken aback and just finished it by saying that there must've been a misunderstanding because the dishes on the table were what we ordered. The server's response was something along the lines of, 'yeah, I know' in a combative tone. So that was a really strange interaction to semi-start off with, but my hunger and quality of our dishes made it easy to get past.  For our entrees, we got the mushroom pie with pasta salad as the side. The pasta salad was a fine accompaniment but the mushroom pie really was the star. It's like a light-ish pot pie... only instead of a crusty crust it's basically baked into a flaky croissant with seeds atop. Redic delish.  We also got the four cheese pizza which isn't normally what I'd order but it definitely sounded more exotic written in Greek on the menu. Plus, the cheeses included in it weren't your standard pizza cheeses and were more like a blend Greek favorites. The smell was heavenly and it easily feeds 3 adults. The thing I would've liked more of was the tomato sauce, which was almost not present at all.  I've had their pastries before so I knew what to expect in that department - nothing short of perfection with most items tasting much lighter than they appear, which is much appreciated after the massive pizza meal. If you can only get one thing, the mango mousse cake is it. It's the perfect happy ending.",0.9916,0.793,0.128,0.079,0.5216203990013513

I normally don't critique every restaurant we go to whether it be good or bad, however, this experience as unacceptable. The server was downright negligent. She walked past our table a handful of times, taking note of our empty beverage glasses and failed to offer refills. Furthermore, she failed to clear appetizer plates out of our way before our entrees arrived. As a former server, I easily sympathize with other servers when they're busy. This was not the case. She managed to find time to socialize with coworkers, as a result ignoring her tables. There was a table of women right next to us that sat down as we were finishing our dinner. They sat for a minimum of 5 minutes without being greeted. Finally they flagged down our server, asking for someone to take care of them. Our server asked them to wait as she returned. Those poor women waited at least another 5 minutes and it was evident that they were infuriated, rightfully so. No patron should wait a minimum of 10 minutes to be greeted and/or place their order. There are too many competitors in Greek town and Artopolis really needs to reevaluate their staff. Save your money and go somewhere else. We will not be returning.

My friend mentioned she saw bread-pudding in the dessert case and she wanted to order some when we leave to bring home. As I have been to this establishment MANY times, I told her that she can do that on the way out as there is a separate cash register at the dessert case. The business hours are until 12am. We get up at 11:15pm to leave and my friend comes up to the dessert case and she's told the register has been shut down. I asked to speak to a manager and expressed that my friend would really like to buy the dessert to take home. I explained to the manager that the business hours are until 12am and she said that due to weather (there was no bad weather), they decided to closer early and that decision is made the day of. Here is my opinion, if you're lacking business and have to shut down early because it's slow in your restaurant...THEN OPEN THE REGISTER TO RING UP A PAYING CUSTOMER!  I couldn't believe how rude the manager was. She gave us attitude and told me to ""calm down, I'll go over there and ring you up"". Seriously, that $3.50 wouldn't have broken bank and if it's such a concern to open a register that's been closed down for the evening, then just give a courtesy dessert to my friend and make a customer happy.

2013-12-14,1.0,"They (the manager) were just so mean. Probably the worst treatment I've received at a restaurant, and now my non-Illinoisan BIL is afraid of the people of Chicago.  i see other yelpers have experienced this as well. SHAME ON YOU ARTOPOLIS. The setting. my brother in law (the notorious BIL) just flew in from out of town into Milwaukee, drove the 1.5 hours to come meet my me and my husband at our apartment in the south loop so that we could spend some family time. we had tickets to a show that was to begin at 10 pm in Wriglyville, so when the BIL got into Chicago around 8:30 hungry, we knew that we wouldn't have much time to take him out for a sit down meal, and decided to go to Artopolis. It's got a cute cafe vibe so we thought we could be in and out as we needed in a nice setting. A waitress greeted us as we entered the 75% empty restaurant at 9pm and asked if we needed a table. I told her that we only had 15 minutes before we'd need to leave so if she thought that was enough time, we would want to. she shrugged and said it'd be unlikely but it's up to us, so instead we said that we'd just order from the counter and sit down for a bit....so we did. The BIL paid for his sandwich and asked for it in a to-go container in case he didn't finish before our now 10 minutes we had left, and we sat on one of the many empty tables so that he could get a bite to eat after his day of traveling. The moment he started eating, we were approached by this very abrasive man, who later identified himself as the manager, and asked what we were doing. i explained that we had a very short amount of time before we had to leave and my BIL was just trying to fit in his dinner. At this point, the abrasive man said that it was against policy that we eat that sandwich in the restaurant because we ordered it 'to-go'. As i looked around the mostly empty restaurant with plenty of tables at 9pm, i briefed him on the conversation that we had with the waitress upon entry. He continued in a rough manner and said that she must have been mistaken and tables are only for those dining in. He treated us like we were stealing food, when we were actual paying customers that just needed a stool, bench, chair to eat a dang sandwich (that my BIL said was very mediocre). After i stood up for us as we felt like we were being bullied on an elementary playground, the manager continued his stubbornness and said he would not stand for us eating the 'take out sandwich' inside, but he could bring the sandwich back to the kitchen and plate it and bring it back out. We had maybe 3 minutes left at this point and my BIL was trying to eat his dinner and just be done with it, so he said he'd pack it up so we could eat it in the car. Artopolis i'm so disappointed in you. you were so mean, your manager was a bully. i'm not even sure what the hullabaloo was about-- was it about collecting tips? i'm not sure. i just know it was an argument that was completely uncalled for.  i have told all of my friends about my experience and will personally forever protest your establishment. learn some manners please. here are a couple of other reviewers who seem to have similar experiences. yelp.com/biz/artopolis-c… yelp.com/biz/artopolis-c… yelp.com/biz/artopolis-c… yelp.com/biz/artopolis-c… yelp.com/biz/artopolis-c… yelp.com/biz/artopolis-c…",-0.9801,0.881,0.039,0.081,0.521593567251462

We decided to share two desserts, a Galactoboureko (lemon curd in a flaky crust) and a Royal White Chocolate Mousse.  Most pastries are in the $4 range and ideal for sharing.  There are a fair amount of traditional Greek pastries like Baklava, and there are a lot of options for more American desserts like cheesecake.  I wished my stomach was a bottomless pit while at Artopolis, because I wanted to try so many more!   There is also a menu of sandwiches and salads, which I'm pretty sure they serve until closing time.  And they have a nice selection of wine.  I did not study the varieties, but if you're looking to try a Greek wine I'm sure the staff could suggest something. There is no excuse to pass up Artopolis if you're out and about in Greektown or the West Loop.  It's casual, but at an off hour, it is also a little romantic.  It's also a relaxing spot if you want to grab some coffee and read a book.",0.9944,0.782,0.208,0.01,0.5392255892255893

I felt like it was best that I have something to eat before hiphop so I found Artopolis. I went in and got a Black Forrest Ham Artopita. To be honest, I wasn't exactly happy when I was told that it was pre-made and then heated. I guess you can get away with things because the pie is technically a pastry, but there are some things that you just don't say outright I think (wink). Also, the pie's cheese taste was a bit overpowering compared to the ham which I had ordered the pie for.  But that was just the pie. Artopolis was great because I felt a sensation of family. There were all these freshly baked goods, including the irresistible Mango Mousse which I highly enjoyed a bit later. There were families and down-to-earth people just having a good time chatting all around me. I was fascinated with the group of other Greek things that they were selling alongside the bakery as well, such as the church-related little statues, tapestries and of course Greek's own alcoholic Metaxa which I need to get and make drinks with sometime.  We're always surrounded by competition and we sometimes suffer from isolation/being selfish. I'd like to suggest, to both myself and all of you out there, to go to Artopolis with your family.

Initially, the manager/host seemed close to telling me to wait outside while me party arrived, (I had only asked politely, to put my name on the list - Wait a minute. Is this the 21st century? - Oh yeah, thanks for reminding me that very little has changed Mr. Manager/Host). I went outside waited for my friend to park and then went back in to be  offered seats at the bar. Methinks not. We were seated in a high traffic area near the back - where the wait staff carried mops and chairs... Oh, did I forget to mention that the waitress came about five minutes after being seated, then came back after another seven to take our order, (a soda, a coffee, two desserts - that came from the bakery area right behind us - not Italy). She chuckled when she asked if we were ready and said something to the fact that we should know what we wanted, because we had to wait so long. Our waitress seemed to disappear after she brought our desserts. The coffee was barely warm. The music was loud given the noise level of the customers, which only served to compound the problem more... The desserts were excellent. The positive! When we were done with our dessert, the waitress cleaned the table, and disappeared again. When we finally saw her again, we had to catch her eye to get the check.... Then she disappeared again! I asked at the ""deli/sandwich counter"" for change, where our waitress was chatting, but was redirected to the dessert/bakery area, where the counter person stated flatly, ""I don't have change!"" Odd! I wasn't going to leave 20 for an 11 dollar meal, especially when the service was so poor. My friend and I stood ready to leave and finally the waitress came, but she was distracted by a waiter. They argued about who was to wait on another table of guest who had been seated for a while with no service. She left after we handed her the check and money and exclaiming to her fellow co-worker, she wasn't given ""them"" any service because it wasn't her table. So there! (Last comment - me:-) I tipped her generously, because she may not get too much ""icing on the cake"" with her attitude. One has to wonder, why is she a waitress? Given everything that happened I have to wonder, why did I go back in after waiting for my friend?  I will be back one-more-time, at a different time of day.

The server spilled an entire glass of ice water down the front of my body and even into my boot and never once apologized for it. she actually didn't even offer me napkins for several minutes. When we tried to speak to manager he was completely rude and unreceptive and even started screaming at me and my family as I stood there drenched. He got in our faces throwing his arms around and screaming he would defend his servers and doesn't care what we say we're not his only customers. What a joke this place has become. I used to go here all the time and after that treatment I won't even walk outside of the place. To the manager with the receding hairline and glasses since i don't know your name good job turning this place into a horrible place to eat have fun keeping any customers with that poor attitude.

Sometimes I'm adventurous and trying something new, but I always revert back to their tiramisu and mango mousse cakes. You can never go wrong.  The main point of my update is to note that if you are ordering from Artopolis, you really need to stick to what they do and not try to get them to do something extra, even if they say they can. My sister ordered a ginormous sheet cake for my bridal shower, and it didn't set in time for our pick-up time. Given it was their mishap, she fought with them to have them drive it out to the suburbs, despite their no delivery policy. After much debacle, they made it happen but unfortunately, they were late and the cake still wasn't entirely set. You can see it slumped a good inch in one corner. Not the end of the world but a noted imperfection and a FYI that their services are best when kept to the services they normally provide.",0.9506,0.852,0.117,0.031,0.47752525252525246

I've placed several large orders for various work-related events and have been extremely satisfied with both the quality of the food and the customer service. However, after a recent encounter with an Artopolis manager, I will never go there again.  After giving the manager $55 in cash to pay for a large order of sweets, I was not given a receipt. Later, when I asked for one, it was for $54. I asked a server about the discrepancy and she kindly offered me a dollar back. Later, the manager asked me if they had ""stiffed"" me a dollar. I explained. He said that when he took my cash, he didn't count it and it included five folded up ones, so how was he supposed to know how much it was. I told him that I had said ""Here's $55"" when I handed it to him. And I also expressed that it's really not my fault if he chose not to count it. He suddenly became angry and sort of in-my-face, and that's when I told him I thought he had treated our group rather rudely in other manners as well. He was incredulous, told me multiple times that I was the rude one, told me I spent no money (meaning we didn't order enough) for our group, berated me for the fact that no one in our group ordered drinks, etc. The entire time, he was patting me on my upper arm and back. I felt threatened and uncomfortable. When I tried to defend myself and explain more about our group, he ordered me to leave the restaurant. I've never experienced anything like this before. I was kicked out. Other staff looked on with surprised looks on their faces.  In a business like food service, managers need to be able to handle customer complaints in a manner that is not threatening. I was very shaken by this encounter and will not go back to Artopolis, lovely and delicious as it is.",0.7333,0.819,0.095,0.086,0.43844537815126056

2012-12-17,4.0,"ONE WORD REVIEW: Gratifying! Stopped in for dinner last night because my girlfriend was craving hummus (it's all she eats since we left Dubai a few days ago!) We started off with the Mediterranean Fest which consists of hummus, fava, baba-ghanoush, tzatziki, tabouleh, and Kalamata olives and pita slices ($8.45) . It was remarkable, to say the very least, each spread was more scrumptious then the last. My favorite was the baba-ghanoush (eggplant + tahini + etc puree).  We all ordered one of their organic hot teas- Ted and I the green and Cortney the mint green tea. No complaints. For my main course I ordered the Traditional Soup- a chicken and rice soup, accented with fresh lemon juice and eggs. ($3.95) Artopolis stayed true to their word- it was DEFINITELY traditional, wonderful and had just the right amount of zestyness. Ahhh! A breath of fresh air for sure! I also ordered their Saganaki Kebob- it was ($8.95) and you get 8 bite sized pieces of saganaki. I was a little disappointed it didn't come on a steaming hot pan, right out of the oven, like in a traditional Greek restaurant, with a sexy waiter dousing the flaming cheese in lemon juice- all the while exclaming ""OPA!!"" and presenting it in an orderly fashion with a grinning smile. No sexy waiter in sight. No flaming hot cheese on a pan. I thought the price included one of these suave men but no, I was wrong :( . Honestly though, this was my first Greek dining experience where the cheese was served on a plate in a very bland way. The cheese itself was gratifying, nonetheless. My friend Cortney ordered the Mediterraneo Sandwich ($11.75) -which consists of a sliced roasted leg of lamb, Dijon mustard mayonnaise, tomato, Green leaf, mint, on Rosemary bread. I had a bite and loved it. The mint just gives the sandwich an accent of flavor- it's not overbearing, in the very least. Ted ordered the Briammi Kefte Sandwich ($7.95) - which consists of an oven-baked lamb and beef kefte, briammi (vegetable ratatouille), crumbled feta, on Old World bread. Needless to say, I would have tried it had he not devoured the whole thing in seconds. Which pretty much sums up my review on that! The sandwich wasn't eaten, ladies and gents', it was inhaled.

We happened to be rolling down Halstead after the lunch rush and she said, ""OK, let's go there!"" I think she went by the paint scheme. We parked across the street in a pay lot, plucked her kids out of their carseats and were greeted by a warm host that promptly seated us in a back booth. Normally, that's kind of a backwater that is only occasionally visited by the servers, especially in a lightly occupied restaurant, as was the case when we lunched this day. There was only the one server, and he seemed to take his workload in stride. I never felt like we were neglected. The kids are pretty well- behaved, so this server may have just not noticed them and treated us like ""regular people."" LOL I had Yuvetsaki, she had the Eggplant Moussaka. They made a small pizza for the kids (!). Neither of us had yet developed a fine enough palate in Greek cuisine to know the difference, but we know what tastes good - and everything we ate tasted great! My Yuvetsaki was baked very nicely - not dried out. She wolfed down her eggplant after giving me a bite. I understood her sentiment.

Service - our waitress was friendly, efficient, and was always available or 'around' if we needed anything Food - The food was delicious, we decided to share so we ordered:  Spinach And Feta (Spanakopita) which contained fresh spinach leaf, spring onion, dill and feta cheese - this was absolutely yummy and made fresh and flaky! Neptune pizza which had rock shrimp, basil garlic pesto, roma tomato, green onions, mozzarella and crumbled feta - the pizza was good as well, this one is a bit on the cheesy side - and I got full from 2 mid sized slices Side of hummus with bread - the hummus is different than Arabic hummus, but still enjoyable, creamy and made fresh. Now we move on to the BEST part of the dinner - the desserts! O-M-G!!!!! They have a huge selection of baked goodness, which is displayed that it is easy to see the desserts and then pick and choose which oneS you want to order (if you are like me!) The hubby ordered berry cheesecake and I had the tirimasu - both were absolutely heavenly and to YUM! And since I couldn't decide on one dessert...I got one to go (and I think the hubby didn't want to feel left out when I enjoy the dessert at home, so he ordered something too!) We got the Valrhona Chocolate Mousse and a Cannoli to go. And can I say that if and when I go back I wouldn't know which dessert to choose from, because they were all soooo good!!! Its like a taste of mouthwatering heavenly goodness in the form of a dessert in a plate in front of you just waiting to be eaten.",0.9979,0.783,0.217,0.0,0.56578231292517

2012-05-07,3.0,"Okay, I've been here three times for lunch. Every single time, I've been confused whether I should take a seat or go to the little deli counter to order. Upon reading other reviews, I guess there's supposed to be a lunch line before 2 pm and sit down for a waiter afterwards? I'm still confused. The first time, I sat down and received excellent service from a waitress whose name I don't remember (she wasn't working there this time). My second time, I sat down to be served and the guy at the counter told me to order my food at the deli area and then sit down (no biggie, I guess). Friday, I came to Artopolis for lunch and went straight to the deli counter. The guy told me to take a seat and wait for a waiter. The hostess/waitress (?) did not even explain any of this and pretty much ignored me when I walked in. The layout features a dining area, bakery, deli/to-go counter and bar all in one open space, so the dining ""rules"" are confusing and can be easily addressed, but I digress... The ambience seemed nice and chill at first (my waiter served a table not too far from me with excellent service), but soon enough I felt a tense vibe. I ordered the Mediterranean salad with smoked salmon. The salmon had an excellent flavor, it tasted almost like sashimi with a hint of smokiness. After ordering, I proceeded to the bathroom. When I returned, the salad was on my table...but missing the bread. I tried to flag down the waiter, but he seemed to be busy with other customers as well as other waitresses (hey, flirt after work!). Ok, no big deal, I can wait. However, the hostess/waitress saw me trying to grab my waiter's attention and approached me to ask if I needed anything (with a cross look on her face). I told her I did not receive a bread basket and would like some. She said no problem, but had this PO'd look on her face as if it *were* a problem. I mean, all you have to do is go behind the deli and grab a bread basket..it's nothing to get all pissed over. However, she seemed to have reprimanded my waiter behind the counter; afterwards, he was more attentive.  After I finished my salad and bread, I almost ordered a double shot but my waiter recommended something lighter since it was quite humid that day, so I settled for a cappuccino fredo, which was an excellent iced coffee and asked about a couple of desserts (seriously, like TWO desserts) before asking about the kataifa (phyllo dessert similar to baklava). He seemed to have been annoyed at that point and said it is what the description described it to be. Hey, no need for the attitude, Mister! Anyway, I ordered the kataifa and ate about 1/3 of it before asking for a box (I can never finish a full Greek pastry dessert like baklava...too dense). He said ""is there anything else you need or want to know about?"" as if I'd been a problematic customer, and that totally blew me away. Of course, I just smiled and said ""No thank you, just the check, please"". However, I totally felt like I didn't deserve that attitude. Hey, I didn't even mind that he forgot my bread or was flirting with that chick in the beginning, but seriously, a few questions about desserts ticks you off? Take a chill pill, man! I must say, the woman behind the bakery section was much sweeter than the other waiters/tresses and asked if I enjoyed my meal/desserts when I asked for a bag (no sense in asking for a bag from Mr. You're-a-needy-customer). One extra star for her service with a smile. Overall, the food was great for lunch. Prices were okay for the food portions. Service for the most part without a smile, and too many rules for lunch.

I'd previewed the menu for Artopolis online before hitting the pavement to explore eateries in the neighborhood and had crossed it off my list because they didn't have a gyro. However, when I saw the place from across the street, after passing greasy dives and large, expensive iconic establishments, this place looked just right. And it was.  The menu consists of mostly lighter lunch-like fare, or so it seemed. I was actually impressed with the heft my sandwich, the Mediterraneo: sliced roasted leg of lamb, dijon mustard mayonnaise, tomato, green leaf, mint, on rosemary bread. It came with a potato salad that was perfectly dressed; not too many ingredients and not over seasoned nor too ""saucy"". The lamb was tender and warm, but not so much as to wilt the lettuce or turn the tomatoes into ketchup. And the bread! Chewy, European style bread with rosemary? Awesome.  After I started eating I decided that it would be nice to pair it with a glass of wine ( I know, it's just a sandwich but...). The ever-attentive server was there like a State Farm agent. She even suggested I taste a few of the wines to help me decide. I'm no wine snob, but I think the house Greek red wine went well with it. I want to order something at a restaurant that I can't make (easily) at home and that is exactly what Artopolis delivers, especially in the dessert department. There were at least 30 desserts on the menu and all of them looked good. I can only attest to the delectability of the dark chocolate mousse, however, because I was completely stuffed after consuming it. I rarely get dessert and am not really a sweets guy, but wow! It was delicious. And the Greek coffee I ordered was its perfect companion. Really the only thing missing was MY companion.

Great for people watching. Instead of getting proper meals, we got apps: spinach leaves, dolmadakia, kaseri & feta. To drink, we got a frappè and vissinada. Everything was properly delicious and came out in waves. The incredibly small table made for some interesting acrobatics, but we ended up consolidating the plates and eating off the serving plates instead of our own dinner plates. It's all good.

This is place phenomenal, I just wish I didn't have to rush through it on my 30 minute lunch break and that I had a dining companion with whom I could have ""mmmm""ed and ""aaaaah""ed with. To start I had the mushroom and emmenthal cheese artopita (essentially a savory croissant filled with all sorts of flavorful rich yummy nom nom goodness) with the potato salad. Pretty sure the potato salad is not made with mayo but rather some type of yogurt (Greek?). Makes it much lighter. Then I ordered a side of pita bread, which they grilled, and a side of tzatziki sauce. The tzatziki was served in three huge balls topped with olive oil and kalamata olives. Talk about presentation! The entire thing was incredible, though the potato salad couldn't compete with the artopita and the tzatziki. As I was leaving I couldn't help but stop at the bakery case and low behold, had to buy a baklava. I went with the walnut baklava roll because (sadly) all I had left on me was $3 in change and the regular baklava would have been close to $4 with tax.

The temperature outside that day was 95 and we had to wait 5 minutes before we could ask for water and waited an additional 5 before it was served. Also during the meal, the staff closed the doors to the outside to put on the AC, which was fine, but the ensuing ruckus of moving tables, chairs and slamming of the doors persisted for 10 minutes which was annoying. Aside from the din in the background and the so-so service, the quality of the food was superb. I ordered the salmon fume and a half bowl of greek country salad and enjoy it.

But one glance at the line of 40 people or so snaked out the door had us changing our mind. And before we could pop into a cab for another breakfast choice, the rain came down so we dashed into Artopolis.  Do they even serve breakfast, I wondered? After all, the beautiful breads and pastries although nice, were not the egg and cheese omelet that I so desired. Oh well- the guys were ready to eat whatever they were serving so we bounded up the stairs to sit by the window and look out at the torrential downpour.  Well let me tell you I was pleasantly surprised. We shared the fresh fruit and Greek yogurt plate. Very fresh and artfully arranged with melon, strawberries, grapes, watermelon, walnuts and honey. We also had a couple of their breakfast sandwiches- the croissant stuffed with scrambled eggs and cheese and the pita filled with eggs and feta. All were quite good and served with more of the freshest fruit I have seen in awhile.  If breakfast is not your thing- there are also sandwiches and salads that you can choose from. We paired our choices up with their delicious coffee and we were happy (especially since there was still a line across the street at Meli when we left).

Always friendly service, nice atmosphere, clean bathrooms, etc. Unfortunately I made the mistake suggesting it for lunch.  Between 3 of us we ordered the smoked salmon, a spanikopita, a Greek country salad, and a ""Mediterranean feast"". The salmon was good, served with capers, onion, and cream, but honestly, it's hard to mess up smoked salmon. The spanikopita was ok as well, but the spinach tasted canned so it was really the potato salad served on the side which overshadowed the spanikopita itself. The salad was a salad, nothing special, but nothing to complain about. The problem was the Mediterranean feast which came with 4 dips. The tzatziki, cucumber dip, tasted like it was made with mayo and had the most bizarre texture, unlike any other tzatziki I've ever had. The fava dip tasted like split-peas, and the hummus was below average.  We asked to see the manager just to ask about what the tzatziki was made with, and he was extremely rude and condescending in his responses to our minor complaints. He started by saying he was Greek and knew what it should taste like, but then a minute later he said that no where on the menu did Artopolis claim to be a Greek restaurant and that their focus was bread and pastries. So when all fails and you realize you can't defend your shitty food claim that food isn't the specialty of the restaurant..? And it was our problem the food sucked because we came in with expectations... ? And no offer to take the dish of the bill, though we would have paid it since we ate about 1/3 of it already, the offer would have been appreciated.

Artopita with Mushroom and Emmenthal was the right amount of flaky pastry, small mushroom pieces and cheese that melted and ran out of the side as you cut into it.  The lunch came with a pasta salad to accompany.   On an Hour Lunch time schedule along the west loop it's perfect to stop by after finding parking which can be dodgy here and there during the rush of lunch time.

Leaning a blue jean clad leg against a wooden chair doesn't harm the restaurant's property in any way. If their concern was that my posture would somehow distract other patrons, they should have also been more worried about the screeching child at the next table. You would think that a cafe would want its customers to be comfortable; essentially demanding that they sit up straight is inappropriate, bizarre and outright rude.  Overall, it was a very disappointing and embarrassing experience. I've had many enjoyable meals at Artopolis, so being verbally assaulted over something nonsensical by the staff was a surprise.

Fist off - no wait.  Yes, you read that correctly, you can actually get a fabulous brunch in Chicago with no crazy wait!!  Unheard of, I know...  The food - along with their regular menu they offer an a-la-carte brunch menu on the weekends till 2pm...indulgent crepes - just as perfect as Meli, French toast, and a fab artopita with egg, veggies, ham and cheese...  Served with a ton of fresh fruit - a perfect breakfast.  I just wish they had a breakfast artopita with no meat in it.   All of their artopitas are so amazing - flaky pastry crust filled with your choice of ingredients - my favorite thing here.  The crostini app is amazing, I make it at home all the time now, and the traditional soup is perfect for a cold day.  The deserts are wonderful, and the coffee is decent. If you're sick of the brunch wait (or hostess!) at Meli then check out Artopolis across the street and you'll be very happy you did.

The European cafe feel of the place reminds me of the several wonderful cafes I frequented while living in Cyprus (Greek-side) for the summer. Kyria (Mrs.) Maria has become like my adoptive auntie, who always welcomes me with a warm hug and hello. Something very rare to find in a big city. Whether or not she is there, each time, I know I am guaranteed a wonderful meal and am never rushed to leave as the staff and the drinks are just as good! It's even a wonderful place to stop by and kill some time before hitting the town for a night out! A few times however, my friends and I enjoyed our stay so much that we decided to skip the clubs and just hang out. I've taken several family members and friends (from all over the country and the world) to this place for a meal, drinks, and dessert, and they've all walked away with a wonderfully memorable experience. All have even returned on their own over the years for more!  The food, after all this time, has still managed to satisfy, if not, go beyond my expectations. My main advice: ALWAYS leave room for dessert when coming here!  You'll be missing out on the best if you don't! - Great for people-watching, plus very attractive staff! - When ordering for pick-up, they always have my food ready in    minutes. (They have been on my speed-dial for years now!) - Brunches: Always a great time there, plus, no ridiculous lines due    to limited hours of operation, like the cafe across the street. - For light, but satisfying food: choose any of the Artopitas with either    potato or pasta salad.  - For a hearty meal: any entree or pizza.  - For satisfying comfort food: be adventurous and try the Youvetsaki!  - Dessert: TRY EVERYTHING!  - If you don't have a very sweet tooth, yet want something perfect: go     for the mango yogurt or fruit tart! - Coffee: go for the traditional Greek coffee (advice for newbies: DO    NOT drink all the way to the bottom!) - Cold coffee: a modern-traditional frappe prepared sweet, with milk.",0.9915,0.778,0.173,0.049,0.613238095238095

I ordered the 2 sandwiches to-go (which comes with chose of potato salad or pasta salad) that the chef recommended. We sat down at a table and tried to order a beer at the bar. They told us we needed a waitress. So we made it more convenient for the bartender and moved our stuff to the bar. We then decided to just eat there while it's still hot. When we got our food, we were told we can't eat ""take-out"" food in the restaurant. WTF? I just paid ~$18 for 2 sandwiches you sold me and you're telling me I can't eat it in the container you gave me? They made us eat it on plates. That's cool, I guess. They had no drink specials so I asked what they would recommend. The bartender was nice (and also funny) and suggested a Greek imported beer, Hillas. Tasted like Miller Lite (that's not a good thing). Sandwich #1: Tequila Pollo Wood-roasted chicken breast, Roma tomato, arugula, avocado, tequila lime mayonnaise, on Sour Dough Boulé $8.45. I only ate half of this and I thought the chicken was small and tasteless. The avocado seemed old and already started to turn a little brown. The sour dough was tough and not sour enough. The potato salad needed more garlic and the mayo was too runny. Sandwich #2: Briammi Kefte Oven-baked lamb and beef kefte, briammi (vegetable ratatouille), crumbled feta, on Old World bread $7.95. I ordered this (to-go) for my girlfriend and these were her specific words: ""So yummy."" She was only able to finish half so I'm eating it for lunch today. I won't be commenting on this since it's now considered leftovers. Ambiance: Well lit using fluorescent many bulbs. Don't come here for a romantic candlelight dinner. Bathrooms: Clean.

2010-06-16,3.0,"Usually when the ugly invisible hand of inflation hits a restaurant, there's only one, very complicated, explanation - the economy.  But in the case of this dining establishment, I think there's a more insidious, psychological, explanation.  Ever since Costa's - a more sit-down place a few doors down Halsted - burned down, Artopolis seems to be trying to take its place.  Except instead of being Costa's, it wants to be ""Cost""-as. And that's just a shame because this place used to be a laid-back breath of fresh Mediterranean air from the tourist prices found at other places in Greektown.  It used to be that me and a couple friends made this a weekly destination for great, homemade tasting, relatively inexpensive spinach pies (the Artopita the restaurant derives its name from) and good conversation overlooking the crowds below from its second story windows.   The windows and views are still there but gone is the cheapness of the spinach pies.  Though the pies themselves are still there and I could still taste every bite of spinach and feta goodness the last time I was there.  I'm not sure if I can say they're worth $2.00 more than they used to cost; but they're still damn good. Unfortunately, with their new pricing schedule, I could no longer purchase the very complimentary (though sadly, not complimentary - only a little plate of bread comes with the mains) sides that I used to get: feta and olives; and potato salad.  Oh, I still got the feta and olives because no Greek meal is complete in my mind without them.  However, the potato salad proved too guilt inducing.  Not because of its wonderful decadence - the potatoes are so thick and smothered with so much mayonnaise that it feels like classy carnival food - but because the last time I was there, I was being treated for my birthday and I didn't want to take advantage of the people treating me.  Even the sides are now over $5.00 a pop!  Seriously, what gives? I really wish I could eat here more often, but I don't understand why a Greek deli counter now charges almost $10.00 for a slice of (delicious) Italian-style pizza.  The inflationary tactics make it seem like more of a special treat now but, unfortunately, I just can't abide by ""Cost""-as' new prices.  Well at least the take-home baked goods, including some great (simple) cookies, are still cheap.  For now.",0.9859,0.765,0.15,0.085,0.4948818542568542

I met some friends for dinner, luckily the kinds of friends who don;t mind sharing.  We started with an appetizer plate with 4 kinds of greek salads and dipping breads. Very fresh and flavorful.  Followed by a pastry puff thing (I'm Polish, so I apologize for not knowing proper names of things) filled with mushrooms and mild white cheeses that was one of the most savory delicious things I've ever eaten. Someone recommended the potato salad as a side which seemed an odd choice  but it was really good!  I think they use yogurt instead of may which gives it extra zip and a bit of lightness (flavor, not calories hehe). Great location only 2 blocks from the Blue line Halsted stop, even walkable from the loop - assuming you're not wear stillettos :)  The place has always been pretty packed at traditional dinner times and later, no doubt because of its proximity to UIC.  So be prepared for an occasional tipsy and/or obnoxious college student rolling in from a local bar. My only complaint was that every time I went service was slow, even when we were there during a slow time. I'm generally not in a huge hurry to get out of there, it has a great vibe, but ocassionally you get stuck waiting to eat a meal you've had for 15 minutes because you need a drink, condiment, etc, and that gets annoying. The little shop in the back of the store is great, lots of wines, condiments, snacks and you can of course purchase items from the dessert case, even cookies by the pound.  Definitely worth a visit.",0.9957,0.669,0.231,0.1,0.5293798449612402

We finally committed to a date and she suggested this place. I was too tired to do my usual restaurant ADD: ""but what about here? or here? or maybe here?"" so I just gave in and said sure. After all, I'm hardly ever in Greektown and perhaps I need to expand my horizons... And overall, I was glad I did. Walking in, the space was A-DOR-A-BLE. Big bar in the middle. Bakery and small shop off to the right. Tables in the front. Cute cute cute. We were given the option to sit wherever we wanted, so we chose to sit in the front window down the steps. I wished it had been warmer, because my friend said in the summer they have the doors completely open. I just imagined a warm summer breeze coming through the doors while I eyed hot greek men and sipped on wine... Oh, sorry, where was I? Ah, yes, Artopolis. The menu is a good variety of Greek and not so Greek food, which suited me just fine. I was craving Italian food (go figure), so the wood fired pizzas caught my eye... but ultimately I settled on the chicken riganatti and my friend ordered one of their sandwiches. Once ordered (oh, we'll come back to that), the food came out fairly quickly. Holy portion sizes, batman. We both had enough food on our plate to feed four, so bring your appetite. My chicken was juicy and mouth watering delicious. The side items left a bit to be desired, but mostly because everything got drowned in the sauce from the chicken. Was that a bad thing? Eh, no. But I would have preferred my potatoes and veggies a little less saturated. The service was PAINFULLY slow all night, and it wasn't that busy. We waited forever to be greeted and have our drink and food order taken. After we were done it took a while for our dishes to be cleared. And while we appreciated that we weren't rushed out and were able to talk for a while, it seemed nearly impossible for us to pay for our meal. We were finally able to ask for our check and our server continued to wander around. I finally made eye contact with him, I raised my eyebrows, he smiled - then seemed to realize he forgot about us and darted over to the register. Seriously. When I got up to use the restroom I walked past the uber tempting bakery cases. Somehow I found the willpower to keep walking and not buy anything. But oh, I was tempted. I don't even have a big sweet tooth and I found myself drooling over everything I laid eyes on. Must come back and get dessert. In addition to baked goods, they have merchandise for sale - including easter baskets. Fun. Total damage for two entrees and two glasses of wine - $37. Totally not bad. I love a good meal, good wine, and good company on the cheap. Despite the iffy service, I really enjoyed my evening here.

More importantly it serves up greek style coffee (frappes, nescafés, greek coffee) and they will ask you to indicate the level of sweetness, metrio (medium), glyko (sweet), and whether or not you want gala (milk) with that.  Even more important, or impressive, is their pasty case, which includes greek and non-greek sweets. As far as their food goes, its good quality, tastes decent, but costs a little more than what I would pay for ($10 salad???). That being said, as a cafe, it's cheaper to get some greek food here than the restaurants in the vicinity. Also, the sandwiches are pretty good, they charge you more than a $5 footlong, but will slap a big spoonful of potato salad on the side for ya.

GALAKTOBOURIKO: the less-famous distant cousin of the Baklava, that is my favorite Greek food ever,  creamy custard, in phyllo pastry with honey and orange syrup..... will take you to heaven (or Athens) and back. Loukomades: Fresh donuts, drizzled with honey and almonds. Pluses:  Tasty bread comes with lunch is their own bread They open pretty late (but beware, if you drink greek coffee that late, you will be up for the next 5-6 hours) I have no bad thing to say about  Artopolis, it is a chic european cafe with a great variety of greek taste.

Otherwise, the food here is fabulous.  Our table had a smattering of entrees including a Campagna pizza which was wonderful.  Pricey, but superb.

Turns out, Artopolis was the nicest place we visited dring our entire stay in Greektown!  My cousin's wife recommended Artopolis, insisting it was her favorite restaurant in the city, and I can see why. The cuisine was delicious (and easily the healthiest meal we had all week), the staff courteous, and the ambiance was both relaxing and invigorating. The space in Artopolis is almost a spectacle unto itself...large ceiling, wooden walkways, and an inviting bar to cozy up to (we skipped the drinks, but enjoyed the elderly Greek gentlemen who were soaking up their lunch adjacent to our table). The servers and bussers were friendly and prompt with their service, made us feel right at home. Onto the food. Our recommendation had claimed that the food was excellent but more affordable than some of the other sit-down Greek restaurants on the block. I am certainly inclined to agree. A relative stranger to Greek cuisine, I played it safe with a chicken and mozarella artopita and a Mediterranean salad. Both were delicious! My phillistine taste buds compared the artopita to ""the world's fanciest hot pocket"": tender, flaky crust and warm insides mingling on the peak of Mt. Olympus. The salad was excellent, as well: greens, tomatoes, cucumber slives and olives with generous dabs of oil and just enough feta on top. A very tasty way to start the day. My friend opted for a sandwich and pasta, which I was envying from across the table, even while I savored my own lunch...the pasta looked divine!

It's filled with portobella mushrooms, onion and emmenthal cheese. YUM!! And it comes with a generous side of either potato salad and pasta salad. The potato salad here is outrageous. It's perfectly creamy and simple. It's not jam packed with a bunch of nonsense, if you know what I mean. Definitely one of the best; I'm not sure what it is.

Their regular food is hit-or-miss.  I've eaten in and taken out, and they really stiff you on the side dish for takeout.  We're talking a generous portion taking up one-third of your plate vs a three-ounce plastic cup.  And speaking of side dishes, skip the pasta salad, which is the blandest thing on earth, and get the potato salad instead.   The jambon fume sandwich is solid with a good balance of ingredients, but the prosciutto is too dry.  The mushroom artopita needs more savory and less creamy ingredients.   Besides being a Greek bakery and agora, they purport to be a traditional European-style cafe.  I ate lunch there on Saturday on my way out of town, and can confirm their success on two points:  1.  Indifferent service; and 2.  Bringing a tiny bottle of Diet Coke instead of serving a fountain version.  Although, the bottle was cold, and they gave me ice in the glass, which of course never happens in Europe. But also, they had a nice sedate atmosphere despite the soccer game playing on the TVs.  There were plenty of seats but most of the patrons seemed Hellenic or at least Eastern European, so that should give some confidence about the authenticity here.   The seasonal soup right now is a potato-garlic puree, which is very tasty if rather straightforward; they serve it with a small basket of soft, aromatic bread of some unidentifiable kind (there are poppy seeds and other dark specks in it).  The Turkey Melinzana sandwich was excellent.  Turkey, provolone, tomato, lettuce, and the two key ingredients--a great kalamata olive bread (and I don't even like olives) and garlic eggplant spread.  This sandwich had perfectly proportioned ingredients.  Damn, damn good.

I think it was made with Greek yogurt instead of mayo so it wasn't really heavy, it reminded me of a Greek version of the potato salad you see at tapas places. The Spanakopita was great, the crust was flaky and the inside very flavorful, I've had some at other places which was quite bland. My friend liked hers too, she finished most of it and she's not usually a big eater.

I was very impressed. Ordering was a breeze--plenty of detailed information on the website and the people I spoke with on the phone were pleasant and efficient. The food went over really well, especially with the vegetarians in our group. I especially liked that they had a lot of options that could be served at room temperature--a variety of salads, fruit, assorted mediterranean dips, mini desserts and those yummy mini artopitas (love the spinach ones!). Nice for warm weather and/or functions where you don't have a lot of time to spend setting things up. Everything was packaged nicely and delivered ready for presentation with serving utensils.

2007-01-12,5.0,"Artopolis is my favorite chill place in all of Chicago. Again, reminds me of Greece with the cafe fare and nice stone baked pizzas and ice coffee (frappe) I recommend the spinach pie and the Lasagna when on special (wednesdays) as well as the rustic Greco pizza. Plum tomatoes, olive oil crust, Kasseri, feta and Motzarrela cheeses and a nice crispy herb crust, very good pizza. I love the hummus there as an appetizer along with a Greek Salad and then sharing a pizza with a date. Try thr ""Megas Oenos"" Red wine with the pizza. Megas Oenos means big one in Greek and it is a big huge red wine with supple tannins and jammy fruit. Makes the cheeses explode in your mouth, great stuff, and an even better finish. This wine has legs a mile long, longer than a 6 foot 2 inch blonde. For dessert, try a frappe, an iced coffee with milk and a medium sweetness. Awesome and addicting. I drink 2 of those every morning before work and my productivity is through the roof. Also, try one of the many delectable desserts and pastries available. to many to mention but there all good.

I have to denote one star because I received the pasta salad side instead of the potato salad side that I ordered, and the pasta was a little too greasy for my liking. I had the chicken lemon rice soup, which was so yummy. The bread at the table was excellent (that's right, excellent). There was so much on the menu that it was hard to choose. All the appetizers sounded amazing. My friend's food looked delicious as well, although the inferno pizza was not as spicy as it sounds. In fact, it didn't have a kick at all. Next time I want to try the pomme frites because those looked like something you have to order. It was a bustling restaurant for a late night dinner and I really liked the energy.

The pizzas are also good-- not sure how Greek they are but they sure are tasty.  As for the sweets, most of them are just okay with the exception of one- I can't remember what it's called, but it's basically fried doughnuts covered in honey. Yeah. It's awesome. Beware the coffee- on one visit they were out of ""American"" coffee and only had Greek coffee, which is somehow both extremely strong (yay!) and extremely sweet (boo.).

Although Artopolis had a cozy environment and delicious raspberry chocolate cake, their customer service was sorely lacking. I got the impression they weren't interested in serving more customers. We waited for 5 minutes and although we were acknowledged and told to seat ourselves, no one approached us before we got up and left to investigate other options. This may seem finicky but the business was slow (it was 11:00PM) and we saw many of the staffers standing around. We decided to return. Our waitress was barely friendly and the milk I received came with some complimentary eye lashes. They were happy to exchange the milk with another and because the food was good, I'll be returning to give Artopolis another try at better customer service.

The food is fresh, prices are reasonable, staff are friendly (albeit a bit slow) and it is probably the only cafe I can think of in Chicago that gives me with real, pressed white napkins and silverware (not like the crappy stuff you get at Denny's).  This place reminds me of Europe! Everything I've had here is amazing - try their sandwiches with come with a side of the most amazing potato or pasta salad. Their salad is amazing and they also have this stuffed buttery pastry stuffed with cheese/ham/spinach/whatever else is their specialty called atropita (sp?) is crisp, warm and absolutely perfect.  Beside the sometimes-slow service, my only thing I would advise is to steer clear of the salmon pizza - it was served with feta cheese, capers and smoked salmon, so I almost was salted to death.  This restaurant also has an array of fresh pastries and cakes (everything from baklava to traditional fruit tarts and carrot cakes).  They also have other traditional greek desserts; one of my favorite being their greek yoghurt, which comes with a side of honey and walnuts. Yum~  although i know not everyone may like it - if you mix all three together, it gives this amazing experience to your mouth because it's sour, sweet, smooth and crunchy all at once.  :D A must-go..and especially wonderful place to have a fantastic cup of coffee and long chat with friends!",0.9944,0.756,0.217,0.027,0.5977272727272727
