Lacked so much flavor and it was on a hogie roll. It wasn't until I ate a fry that I knew I wouldn't return to this place. They were missing the most basic ingredient of all, SALT. Bland bland bland, and the cheese! The cheese was cold (maybe because he warmed it in the microwave and then put in a separate container and not on the fries) and had the weirdest taste to it.

Overall, the wings were decent.  I'd stress to first-timers that you probably won't satisfy any cravings for the classic wing here- the sauce is more sweet than spicy with some buffalo sauce as the base, and a mix of some mildly Asian flavors (soy sauce and/or garlic, perhaps?).  That being said the sauce was tasty in its own right, just not to be confused with classic buffalo.  I've read a lot of reviews on Yelp about the wing size being particularly small- had I not seen this I wouldn't have even questioned it.  The wings were of standard size, and honestly I'd prefer my wings on the smaller size than the hormone-laden overgrown variety.  The wings were juicy, cooked well, and overall tasty... but my quest for the best Chicago wing continues.",0.8882,0.872,0.093,0.034,0.5035620176924526

2007-03-30,3.0,"I'm partial to food outlets with odd names--in their case, the oversight of singular/plural distinction with respect to their 'specialty', wing.  Or wings.  Anyway, I actually had the Philly, since I don't really like the meat to skin/fat ratio of the average chicken wing, and while I don't think I'll ever find a Philly that can compare to one actually purchased and eaten in south Philadelphia, theirs was pretty good.  I like that the place is tiny.  The girl working at the time had some slick R&B jams blaring, which no doubt must have perplexed the two senior citizens quietly eating at the other table.   So, although there are lots of options on this stretch of Clark, it's worth a try if you're passing by, before or after the bar, for cheap, quick eats.",-0.2152,0.825,0.078,0.098,0.4519607843137255
2007-03-26,4.0,"OH MY GOD THIS IS THE BEST PLACE TO EAT EVARRRRRR!!!!1! Or it was at 2:30am after we walked out of Neo starvin like Marvin. Decked out in black, gray and black the 5 of us wandered up Clark toward our cars but stopped in to get something, ANYTHING to eat. I had seen House of Wing lots and lots, never was brave and/or drunk enough to stop in. Until that night. My wife and I ordered a bunch of wings and a jumbo hotdog. And a cola. And oh man, this may be the booze talking but it tasted like freaking GOLD in my mouth.  Well good tasting gold. You get the point. Gah! Shutup! Drink it up and stop in, the nice asian girl will take your order with very little sassback and your food will be in your gullet before too long. Their wings were nice and spicy and not too vingery, which is a pitfall too many wing shops fall into. I can't comment on the hotdog, I didn't eat it but my wife is still alive so I have to imagine it was alright.",0.9088,0.768,0.145,0.087,0.586904761904762
2007-02-26,2.0,"Behhhhh.... Sorry for everyone who has to go here after me, because I ordered a wing from House of Wing so now they must be fresh out.   They're just ""House of"" now.   These are the types of wings that are cooked rubbery chicken skin just oozing with sauce and require gloves to eat less you have stained hands for a week.   A cramped tiny space with an out-of-tune tv blaring in a corner.  No thanks.  I'd rather go to Hooters.",0.4019,0.891,0.065,0.044,0.5361111111111112

The guy that owns the resturant is super nice, if you want something custom made to your taste buds, he'll do it for you. The only draw back is that they have sort of odd hours and sometimes in the evening you just can't catch them open!",0.9331,0.752,0.206,0.042,0.5833333333333333
