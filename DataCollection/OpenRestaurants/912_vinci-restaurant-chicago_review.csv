2017-06-15,4.0,"I visited Vinci with a friend prior to attending a show at the Royal George Theater. It was a restaurant suggested on the theater's website and it ended up being a great suggestion.  My friend and I ordered the grilled octopus, the arancini balls, and the tagliatelle. The grilled octopus wasn't great, it was touch and chewy but the presentation was nice. The arancini was absolutely delicious. I'd order that again in a heartbeat. The tagliatelle came with a rage sauce and it was also fantastic, although it was a lighter dish than I expected. I loved it.  The service was great. There was a small incident when a waiter knocked over a glass of wine but it was almost empty and they brought us another carafe immediately and cleaned up the small mess right away. It wasn't a big deal but they more than compensated for the small mishap. They were friendly and attentive.",0.9846,0.723,0.22,0.056,0.5663533834586467

The interior gives more of a traditional italian feel.  It's nicely maintained and clean.  The dim lighting adds a nice level of intimate appeal too. We started off with a mussel dish.  This had a delicious tomato based sauce and several small mussles making this perfect to share among 4 people.  The flavors were great and the texture of the mussles showed that they were not overcooked.  In fact, the sauce was so good, I took it home and ate it like a zuppa di pesce... because it had such a strong resemblance in terms of flavor. My main dish was the risotto.  I felt the risotto rice was cooked well... not too soft but not too firm, and the flavors were great.  It was creamy and had the right amount of salt.  We did not have to wait too long for our food too! Service is what took this beyond what would have been a 4 star review.  The older gentlemen serving bread was absolutely beyond polite and inviting.  He made our experience that much better because his personality was so bright and genuine. This is a great place if you're look for a more authentic taste of italian food.  It can also be an intimate place for taking a special someone to.",0.9928,0.807,0.193,0.0,0.5590336134453784

2017-04-14,2.0,"My fiancé and I had dinner at Vinci having heard good things, but we experienced the opposite. First of all, I want to credit the wait staff for being so helpful and accommodating even though what seemed to be the manager behind the bar was despicable.  For what we paid, the food was generic Italian at best. For the prices, I expected much better. My brown butter sage ravioli was like eating a ball of cheese and the sauce was very bland. My fiancé was given the wrong cocktail that wasn't even drinkable. However, that wasn't even what deterred my experience. Upon leaving the restaurant my waiter wished me a Happy Easter and I reciprocated. The bartender decided to mock me for observing this holiday by belittling scripture he poorly recalled, sighting sarcastic pieces of verses back to me. I ignored him while waiting for my fiancé to go to the bathroom and listened to him insult me behind my back within earshot to another customer.  I tend to let many things go, but as a Chicago resident this was by far one of the worst restaurants experiences I've ever had in the city. At the end of the day, a business makes me feel is more important than anything else.",0.9202,0.755,0.149,0.096,0.553623188405797
2017-03-23,2.0,"Wonderful service, lovely authentic-feeling Italian atmosphere but I've had far better quality and taste for much less money. Vinci is among tough competition on Halsted with Balena and Boka, however, I expect much better from such a long-standing and well-reviewed restaurant. We dined before a show at Steppenwolf and the place was nearly dead. We ordered two entrees as well as wine; which they sell by the 1/4, 1/2, and full bottle. Following that, we enjoyed dessert and a very flat glass of Moscato D'Asti. Spinach and ricotta ravioli with browned butter and sage: unmelted cheese atop the ravioli, and not nearly enough of the browned butter sage sauce resulting in a rather bland dish. Not bad but not great, mediocre at best.  Chicken Saltimbocca with polenta and lemon caper sauce: The polenta with the lemon caper sauce was by far the best part of this meal! Unfortunately, the chicken breasts were dense and rubbery with very hard, crusted prosciutto on top making it difficult to cut and chew. While chicken saltimbocca is supposed to be salty, I found this dish to be extremely over-salted and almost unbearable. The spinach was, well, just a pile of cooked spinach. This dish gets a thumbs down.  Blueberry creme brulee: Sweeter-than-usual creme brulee with an excellent sugar crust. I would have liked more blueberries in and on top of the dessert. There were about five berries seemingly poked into the custard, which was again, underwhelming. However, we certainly enjoyed it and would recommend that dessert to someone in the future. Lemoncello & chocolate biscotti gelato: Basic. Nothing to love, nothing to hate.",0.9909,0.712,0.203,0.085,0.6251388888888888

My bf enjoyed his lamb meatballs, but since we ordered more than 2 can eat (typical of us), he found the last one a bit heavy. But that pizza. *SMH* It tasted like frozen pizza from the grocery store. Not Digiorno. That stuff is good. But more like the $3.99 store brand frozen pizza. We had a couple slices and passed on the rest. I usually take my leftovers home, but those weren't even worth the fridge space. Very disappointing for an Italian place.  Service was good. We were seated prompted from our walk-in on a Saturday evening.  Warning: got seated in the corner of the back room, right by the heater. Boy was it HOT! I know i could've said something, but seemed like it was central heating so i didn't want to bring down the temp of the entire place.

2017-02-15,4.0,"Came here for a romantic Valentine's Day dinner. They had a special Valentine's day three course menu for $38 per person. A great deal because most of the things we wanted from the regular menu were on the special menu. They gave us some bread to start out the night. I wish the bread was warm because it would have tasted so much better. The butter would have also melted on it instead of just getting clumpy.  We started out with the ""roman style"" gnocchi and sausage with goat cheese. The gnocchi was tender and fluffy while the mushrooms and sauce made every bite pillowy and creamy. I don't really like big mushrooms, but these ones were delicious in the sauce. I was so close to licking the bowl. The sausage was pretty good with a nice spicy flavor.  In addition to our three courses, we also ordered the rigatoni. I wanted to try it because I read from other reviews that it was really good. I was so glad we got it! The pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was rich and meaty. It was a blush cream sauce that was just amazing. We decided to eat only a little bit and save room for our entrees and dessert. The waitress was very aware of when we were done and made sure to bring out our entrees as soon as they were ready.  We had the roasted duck and pappardelle with beef short rib. The duck was very well cooked and tender. It was surrounded by a balsamic reduction which gave it a tangy flavor. The sides were not that dazzling to me. It came with broccoli, polenta, and oyster mushrooms. Normally, I love polenta, but this one was a little lackluster and didn't taste like anything. The oyster mushrooms were a really weird texture and I did not enjoy them. The broccoli was limp and forgettable. The pappardelle with the beef short rib was very good though. Honestly at this point, I was so full from the first few dishes that I could only eat less than half of my duck.  Dessert was wonderful! A nice way to end this dinner. The tiramisu was everything that I hoped for. The ladyfingers were a good balance of espresso to the cream and mascarpone. I've had tiramisus where they had too much rum but this was the perfect balance. The blueberry crème brulee was also a star of the night as well. The crunch of the caramel as you crack through the top told me that this was a good one. The custard wasn't too sweet so it mixed well with the caramelized top.  The service was great and they treated us so well. The waitress recommended us a nice wine to go with our meal. I would recommend the gnocchi, rigatoni, and the two desserts. I would suggest that you come planning on spending about 2 hours because there's quite a long wait time in between courses. We ended up spending about 2.5 hours there but we also took our time.  Would love to come back and try their other dishes!",0.9992,0.743,0.235,0.023,0.5838389295889298

GOOD: I liked the rigatoni with sausage & rapini; it was tasty and straightforward. My companion's duck ravioli were rich & flavorful, though larger than she prefers.

Anyway, our new waiter was great and very attentive, so we were more optimistic about the night after he arrived.  I ordered some blood orange sour cocktail that wasn't that great, but my friend drank it and said it was OK to him. He ordered two wine flights and they were nothing special.

We got there at 730, and the restaurant was nearly empty... not a good start! the lighting is so bright, and gives you the feeling of seating in a cheap canteen, they could definitely improve on that.  looking at the menu, we first ordered a Vinci's caprese salad. It was basically a few slices of thick hard tasteless mozarella (yeah the cheap one you can get at any grocery store) drowning in balsamic vinegar... seriously, a 5 year old could make a better dish. what a disappointment! the minimum standard would be to use some fresh mozarella di bufala. second course: my wife ordered the pork chop, again a disppointment, the pork was totally undercooked and bland. the beans were good but thats about it. I ordered the pasta with the veal ragu, the sauce was ok but the pasta watery and very thin. i really did not enjoy the texture of that dish. But it was the best dish overall so far. We decided to share the cheesecake as advised by the waiter. Again, nothing special, really disappointing.  The only positive note was the service. Staff was friendly and available.  I would strongly recommend to try other places if you want good itslian food in the area.

We took the two corner seats at the bar and were immediately given wine lists and recommendations, ordered, and after some idle talk about why we were in town, what we had done, etc... until we let slip that we hadn't seen a play yet, upon which our drinks were taken from us and it was demanded that we run down the block to Steppenwolf and fight tooth and nail for two tickets to ""The Qualms"". Long story short, five minutes later we had our hands on two tickets three rows back from the stage in the center of the theater, and the play did not disappoint. We made our way back to Vinci, sides sore from laughter, to find two new glasses of wine poured for us and menus back at our seats. Our bartender kept up the service all night as the restaurant emptied and we cleared the last of the food (which, by the way, was top notch) from our plates as we picked up and had a late night stroll back to our home away from home.",-0.4047,0.856,0.065,0.079,0.23813131313131317

Many, I'd prefer over this one, but quite a few, I'd actually prefer this one. Of course, just like America, you can definitely find a mix of good and bad restaurants. Overall, I could have been dropped into Rome and had this very experience though. Important to note: many of my positive feelings about Vinci are largely due to their work done for the celiac community.  Bruschetta:  Zucchini & Goat Cheese (table fav); Caramelized Onion & Pancetta; and traditional bruschetta.  Pappardelle: Spinach pasta with roasted duck and mushrooms. Great flavor. Duck cooked perfectly. Truffle oil can be overdone sometimes but this was a nice addition to the pasta dish.  Pork Chop. Non GF came with flash fried green beans. GF pork chop came with cooked spinach. --the spinach looked unappetizing and our celiac brother did not like it. Both served with potatoes.  Everyone who ordered it agreed though. --A perfectly cooked pork chop.  Roman Style Baked Gnocchi with wild mushrooms. YUM!!!! Sadly, I had to pace myself for the rest of the dinner so I had to leave leftovers. We split it as an appetizer but I could have eaten that as my meal.  Dessert: Celiac bro ordered the creme brûlée with blueberries. He loved it. Creamy with a well caramelized top. Just as it should be. The rest of the party ordered the apple cake with caramel and cinnamon gelato. All three of us loved it. :)   I cannot leave out the service. Between having one member of our party celebrating their birthday and another who has celiac disease, we had a lot going on at our table. The service was perfect. Drinks kept coming.

2013-06-09,5.0,"Absolutely in love with this place after my first experience here just last week. If you avoid gluten for any reason, this place is a must visit. Since deciding to avoid gluten for medical reasons about a month ago, I've been missing my favorite carb-y standbys: pizza, pasta, bread, the usual. And while it's possible to ""fake"" this stuff at home or at Whole Foods, I've missed being able to enjoy myself at a restaurant without interrogating the waiter like the KGB. Vinci has a lengthy gluten-free menu and they even bring gluten-free bread to the table at the beginning of the meal once you let them know you're gluten free. Yay! A real restaurant experience. We enjoyed pizza, two pasta dishes, an entree, and dessert with homemade limoncello (do NOT miss it) and loved every single thing we tried. In fact, we're going back this week.

2013-05-20,3.0,"Came here on a groupon and immediately liked the layout of the restaurant upon entering. It had nooks and crannies built in with little two person tables and bigger, more open areas for larger parties- I'm a fan of restaurants that create little seating communities, rather than present you with a large room full of tables and chairs. But then we were placed in one of these crannies with two other two person tables and it seemed a little crammed- plus, I could easily hear the other two parties' conversations. With other open spots in the place on a slow night, I would rather sit apart from other diners.  We ordered an appetizer. I had the sausage, which was quite good, and I heartily finished my plate. Then I had the ravioli in butter, which I was very much looking forward to, and yet didn't find all that appealing. I know I should have expected a heavy dish, considering my noodles were swimming in butter, but I have had a brown butter sauce that was higher on flavor than on oil because it was burnt out a little more. I'm not sure that it was the recipe's fault as much as my bad choice because I've never had this dish before, but I wouldn't order it again anywhere. I ate half and took the rest home, though I didn't care to finish it. Overall, I can see the appeal to this restaurant and I would give it another chance, but I'm not in a rush to do so.",-0.6688,0.883,0.06,0.058,0.4664708994708994

2013-05-18,1.0,"Came in Saturday evening at 6PM.  The place quickly filled up, which seemed like a good sign, but there wasn't a person under 50, which gave the opposite impression.  Ordered the seafood pizza for myself and my girlfriend had a special chicken and eggplant pizza. My seafood pizza arrived and basically looked like someone vomited on it.  It was on the border of inedibly salty, with no other flavors present, though the crust was quite decent.  I tried to salvage it with table pepper, but the pepper seemed like it was several years old and had lost all pretense of being pepper. The chicken and eggplant special pizza had no seasoning as far as I could tell.  Somehow the pesto had no flavor, which is a remarkable accomplishment for pesto.  The chicken itself was obviously cooked from frozen without seasoning and was overcooked. The panna cotta with cherry balsamic-ish dressing was uninspired, but serviceable.  Surprisingly, they did not mess up heating cream and sugar with vanilla beans and gelatin.  The dish was still uninspired, with canned cherries and low-quality vinegar, but it was a cut above the pizzas. The service was mediocre, but this is not entirely the server's fault.  Not sure if there was an unexpected geriatrics convention in town and they were simply understaffed, but a single server was apparently running roughly two dozen tables on one side of the restaurant.  There are bussers filling your water, etc., but our server never even asked how we liked the food, it was all very in and out.",0.9566,0.809,0.128,0.063,0.5708013312852023

These three dishes were shared between my wife and I along with a split of wine.  About $70 so not bad.  Octopus a must have, pasta was solid, veal was pretty good.

For Italian food to WOW me, it has to be something I am not able to even think about making because it's so complex. Having said this, I feel that Vinci is ok. I've been there one for Sunday brunch and once for carry-out dinner. The brunch was nice as it was during the summer and the patio is cute outside. I had a frittata and being that it was the first time I had one, I enjoyed it fairly. As soon as I learned how it was made, I always cook them in my house and they come out just as good.

2013-02-04,4.0,"I love Groupon!  Groupon does an admirable job of getting us out of the neighborhood, trying restaurants that we might not normally discover.  Sure, sometimes they are duds.  But now and again, we find a real keeper.   And on a recent trip to Vinci, we discovered just such a keeper.  We arrived ahead of the theatre crowd, and were promptly seated in the window.  The place filled up pretty quickly, but service was attentive and prompt. We started with some bruschetti.  They have a few options available.  The one topped with sun-dried tomatoes was really good.   I was excited to see that they offered a vegetarian option beyond the ubiquitous pasta with red sauce and ""pasta primavera"" which is code for the drowning of some broccoli in a heavy cream sauce.  The Vegetarian plate was really quite nice:  A grilled Portobello topped with bread crumbs and cheese, some roasted red peppers and squash, grilled asparagus, and a ""polenta cake"" sitting in a light tomato sauce.  Way too much food for me, but that is why we have take out boxes!    The spouse had a hard time deciding between the Veal Satimbocca and the linguine with mussels, calamari, and shrimp.  He went with the linguine and proclaimed it quite tasty, but would have preferred a more substantial portion.   (That's okay, though.  When we got home he scarfed down my leftovers.) Crème brulee was nice.  Made with blueberries.  Nothing mind blowing, but still quite nice.   I also loved the fact that we could get a half bottle of wine!  A bottle is a tad too much for us to consume with dinner, but a half bottle is perfect.  I'm sure we will be back. Be advised that their proximity to Steppenwolf and the Royal George makes them a very popular pre-theatre dining locale.  If you want a table between 6 and 7:30, make sure you make reservations.",0.9949,0.825,0.165,0.009,0.5522376543209877

I ordered: 1) Roasted baby eggplant with tomato sauce, goat cheese, basil;  2) Grilled pounded pork chop with roasted Yukon gold potatoes, wrinkled green beans, balsamic reduction and rosemary pancetta sauce; and 3) Tiramisu: espresso & rum soaked lady fingers, mascarpone, zabaione with chocolate sauce and berries.  I was expecting small dishes because of the Restaurant Week prix fixe menu, but each was surprisingly large. My favorite of the three dishes was the eggplant. The tomato sauce was rich and tasty, and I would gladly order it again. The pork chop was slightly over-salted, but I really enjoyed the potatoes and green beans.

(The larger private room, the Enoteca room, seats up to 50 and the room next door seats about 30.  We used both rooms since we had about 60 guests - they are joined by a large door.)  The Enoteca room has an entire wall filled with wine bottles and Italian-style paintings; the smaller room is full of windows.  They are both quite nice. We worked with Aykut Sinoglu, the manager, to set up the event and he was incredibly responsive via email, thorough, professional and helpful.  Vinci accommodated everything we needed - from multiple high chairs and boosters for kids, to bringing in kosher wine and challah for the Sabbath blessings at the beginning of the meal, to modifying a couple of items on the menu to accommodate dietary restrictions.  The food was quite good (the appetizers and desserts amazing, the main courses had a bit more variance - the only minor complaint was that the salmon was over-cooked, which tends to happen when you are serving a large crowd).  The ambiance was informal and fun, and the staff very good.  The restaurant's pricing was also extremely reasonable - our guests got 3 appetizers served family style, a choice of four main courses, and a choice of two desserts - all for the same or less per person than you would spend if you went to the restaurant on your own and ordered an appetizer, main course and dessert off the menu.  Vinci allowed us to have guests order drinks off the menu and charged us per consumption (rather than charging $10-plus per person for an open bar which most restaurants require) which saved us a lot of money since ours was not a big drinking crowd.  We selected the choices off of Vinci's full menu and due to the large number of dishes they let us offer, we were able to accommodate vegetarians and all sorts of dietary preferences.  Vinci decorated the tables with candles and bowls of vegetables, and they printed menus for each guest which included a heading about our wedding on the top.  Every detail was taken care of for us and we just showed up and had a GREAT time!  This is a great choice for a private party - although I would say it's better for a shower or informal family dinner (such as ours) than a more formal event (I don't think it would be formal enough for an actual wedding reception, at least for my taste).  They were very tolerant and accommodating of small children running around too.  We really had a good experience.",0.994,0.873,0.118,0.009,0.45860347985347977

2012-02-25,4.0,"It was a last minute decision to go here last night because it was the only place around that had reservations available around 8pm. That was kind of scary because we wondered why it still had open tables available. But our fear was not warranted. This place has some darn good food and with large portions. Again, we decided on the Restaurant Week prix fixe menu. I started off with the roasted baby eggplant with tomato sauce, goat cheese, and basil ( pinterest.com/pin/252483… ). I had originally intended on getting the carpaccio but I'm glad I went with the eggplant. This was simply delicious. All the flavors went well together, especially as the goat cheese melted in the tomato sauce. The cheese with tomato sauce and basil was bursting with robust flavor. I also didn't thing it would be such a large portion. It nearly had me full by the end. I'm not really sure why they call this baby eggplant - I've never seen baby eggplant this large before. Regardless, the best part about it is that I think I can actually make this at home.  For the main course, I chose the grilled duck breast in balsamic sauce with broccoli di rabe, polenta, and fonduta stuffed tomato ( pinterest.com/pin/252483… ). Again, I was pleasantly surprised at how much food there was. I was about a third done when I realized I simply couldn't eat anymore or I'd not be able to make it out for the rest of the night. The duck was grilled to perfection. I asked for it medium and it was exactly how I expect medium to be cooked. I didn't think the balsamic sauce was that great though, so I basically ate the duck breast without it. The rest of the items on the dish were also very tasty, especially the tomato. I'm not always the biggest tomato fan but stuff it with some cheese and I'll certainly eat it. Lastly, for dessert, I ordered the crème brulee with blueberries ( pinterest.com/pin/252483… ). This was a very traditional crème brulee which I appreciated. I had a passion fruit version of the same dessert a week ago at Cafe 28 and, while it was good also, I liked this one more because I prefer a less tart-y dessert.  It was very serendipitous for us that, although this place wasn't one of our original choices, we really enjoyed the food here. If you're looking for traditional food with plentiful portions, I would definitely recommend this place. I know I'll be going back here again.",0.9973,0.817,0.168,0.016,0.5154930766632896

2011-09-12,4.0,"As a Vinci long-timer, we made a reservation last Saturday partially because we were in the mood for some pasta, but also since we wanted to see if an old friend had really become as bad as recent reviews would lead one to believe. Well, I'm happy to report that Vinci is still a solid four star restaurant in my book. It will never be 5-star, nor does it pretend to be. It is just good solid Italian food served by a great waitstaff. The food here leans more toward the Northern Italian variety, with an occasianal nod to the south, so if you''re looking for a plate of spaghetti and meat balls this isn't the place for you. We started with the Arancini special as well as the Baked Gnocci with muchrooms. Both were delicious and the Gnocci came out postively bubbling away - so much for the reports of cold food. The special Risotto was delicious, as was the old standby Tagliatelli with veal ragu. Not a sign of Chef Boy-R-Dee anywhere. The one failing here is that their wine list has slipped badly in recent years. We used to go to Vinci to discover interesting wines that we might have never heard of before, while sometimes splurging on a bottle of their reserve wines. The list is now pretty much mainstrean, and the reserve wines are clearly not being restocked as they're depleted. We arrived a little after 6:30 on Saturday just as the Steppenwolf crowd was moving on toward their desserts. I was happy to see that after they left the restaurant still had several table occupied with people coming in. Still not full, but our server said that things had been picking up recently after a very slow summer.

I thought I was a big hot shot finding a groupon, $1 for $30 at Vinci, thinking I could get a nice cheap date with my girlfriend at a nice place. Strike one, ""you get what you pay for"" I went to Set up reservations on Yelp and there were some bad reviews. Strike two, ""Yelp is always Right""  We arrived at our 9pm reservation on a Friday night and we were one of three couples. It was like being at a Florida Marlins game. Awkward, filled with some old people too confused to know better, and a south beach douchebag and his girlfriend. Strike three, ""empty restaurants should tell you know one likes this place when it is in a PRIME location in a well off neighborhood"" But, I moved on and ordered. I got a pizza and a 312 beer. The waiter said the price was $5 and I got charged $7 for the beer. The pizza tasted like piss. My girlfriends pasta was small but so awful we couldn't finish it to complain about how little there was.  But wait....  It gets worse.... The service was awful. We were treated like Florida Marlins fans from 1993 when the team lost 98 games. We were lured in with a promotion treated like shit when we got there. We spoke with the manager and said that the food was not worth the $1 groupon and was uneatable.

So bad that I will never go again and make sure that everyone I know will never go there as well. I ordered the ravioli; it was disgusting. It tasted like they used noodles out of a can with a sauce made entirely of salt. I ate about one piece of ravioli and could not finish it. My boyfriend ordered the sausage pizza. Another huge disappointment. It was soggy and sparsely covered in lumps of cheese and meat. When the waiter asked how our meals were I told him mine was terrible, and my boyfriend responded similarly. Instead of being asked if there was anything he could do or offer us new meals, the waiter took our food and left! So even if I had wanted to choke down a few more pieces of salty ravioli I couldn't! He returned with the bill, and we asked to speak with the manager. HUGE MISTAKE! I have never met a ruder manager in my entire life. I rarely speak to the manager at restaurants, but this man treated us so unacceptably I just wanted to pay the bill for our overpriced, horrible and leave.

Tonight I chose the roasted eggplant with goat cheese (and a beautiful light tomato sauce) to start, pasta and veggies for second (there were several meat dishes on the fixed price menu as well), and the Italian cookies for dessert. My husband ordered the mixed salad, penne marinara, and gelati for dessert. The desserts were enough for four people. Honestly!

2011-06-13,2.0,"Chicago offers some amazing Italian restaurants. Sadly, I will not consider Vinci to be one of them. Here are the reasons why: 1. I had the risotto with roast chicken, pesto and caramelized onions. I may just as well have had an off-the-shelf pesto sauce dumped onto my arborio rice and mixed it with day-old roast chicken meat. The pesto overpowered the entire dish that there was nothing else I could taste. The pieces of chicken meat were evidently overcooked and dry that there were morsels I had a tough time swallowing. Note that these morsels have been doused in pesto sauce and I still noticed how tough the meat was.  2. The service was inconsistent at best. Our server gave an acceptable recommendation when I told her that I was in the mood for red wine that was heavy and dry. However, when my friend ordered the grilled octopus, which was an antipasti, and clearly said that it was all she was having, the server still opted to wait until my friend finished it before coming back and asking if she wanted an entree. When my friend declined, that was when she said (and clearly not happily) ""Okay, let me put their orders in then."" Mind you, we gave our orders the same time my friend did.  3. We were on our way to see the side-splitting, laugh-out-loud Dixie's Tupperware Party at the Royal George Theater (shout out!). When we declined to do dessert and simply asked for the check, there was no ounce of courtesy to thank us or even asked how we found the food nor the service. In fact, it seemed like she was even annoyed we opted to skip dessert. Overall, this is just plain disappointing.

Sadly, though, I needed to get a grip. I returned to your loving embrace and you dropped me flat on my face. On a beautiful Saturday night, the restaurant had only a few patrons--bad sign. We quizzically got seated in the back near the bathrooms. The smell of bathroom and cheap hand soap and other unpleasantries mixed with Italian food does not a happy eater make.  Our waiter was over the top--and not in a good way. He foisted the 12 vegetable soup on us along with the caprese salad and he promised the artichoke goat cheese bruschetta would be phenomenal. He lied. The $7.50 small bowl of soup tasted like a marinara sauce out of a Chef Boyardee can. Not tasty. The mozzarella in the caprese made me think rubber tires would be better. The bruschetta was just ok, not bad but not great. For our entrees, my better half ordered the mahi mahi and really it looked grey and less than fresh. The polenta mound was the best thing on the plate, according to the lover.  I ordered the quatro stagione pizza and it was actually quite good. Minus the anchioves, which I immediately asked for on the side, the pizza satisfied my carbohydrate craze.  Nothing for dessert. No way. The food was just ""meh.""

2011-01-24,2.0,"Food:  2 Service:  3 Atmosphere:  2 Value:  1 Veni, Vidi, Vinci?  It's not hard to find good Italian food in Chicago, so I let Groupon guide me on this one.  After a long Thursday at the office, I decided to meet my wife there around 7:30.  After looking for parking for about 15 minutes, we finally made our way inside. The first thing I noticed is that this place was dead.  Eerily quiet, especially for a Thursday night.  The place was probably only 15% full, with a couple patrons at the bar.  Looking at the menu, I was a little surprised there weren't more options for vegetarians.  However, we settled on the Quattro Stagione Pizza (Cremini mushrooms, caramelized onions and goat cheese; Eggplant and arugula with fontina; Artichokes and scamorza; Napolitana) and the Cavatappi Pasta (broccoli, zucchini, grape tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, parmigiano). The pasta came out first (Yes, I know, reverse order, but we said that was okay) and it didn't look like anything special.  Noodles and vegetables in a light garlic sauce is what I would call it.  Unfortunately, the taste matched its woefully mediocore appearance.  The noodles were cooked to a nice al dente, but the sauce was far too light and watery.  At $18, I would have expected something a little more substantial from the vegetables as well.   The pizza was more memorable, and quite unique.  It was a ""sampler"" of 4 different pizzas-2 pieces each.  You can't go wrong with caramelized onions, mushrooms, and goat cheese, and Vinci didn't disappoint with this one.  However, you could serve those ingredients together on my adidas sandals and they would taste good.  The eggplant and arugula was average, but I'm generally not a big fan of leaves on my pizza.  The artichoke pizza was pretty solid, but I was most surprised by the napolitana.  I don't care for olives but they actually went perfectly with the smooth mozzarella and spicy pomodoro-style sauce.  This dish alone might have saved the dinner, if it wasn't also outrageously priced at $15.           Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place to my fellow kosherites or vegetarians.  The meat courses might be a little more substantial, but the complete lack of ambience and/or vibe in the restaurant is very off-putting.  I understand that the high rent mandates the high prices, but even Jimmy McMillan couldn't justify the high prices for the mediocore quality.  I came.  I saw.  I wasn't impressed.

2011-01-18,3.0,"I probably should have ordered one of their Italian specialties for brunch the other day rather than the ""Eggs Benedictine"" that I did choose, as the pasta at the next table certainly looked better than my eggs.  But it was on a Sunday, and I love brunch out, so the eggs won out over my better judgment.  Our server seemed to be a bit distracted- he didn't know what the price was of the mimosa Breakfast flight (why it wasn't on the menu is unknown to me), he struggled with my friend's food allergies and all in all did not exude the confidence that I like to see in a server. Oh well- he got the food to the table and was trying to be helpful.  My friend obviously ordered better than I did. Her polenta pancakes with bacon and syrup disappeared quickly off her plate, while I worked to cut through the tough focaccia bread that my eggs were sitting on. Also- the ham on the Benedict was a crispy fried pancetta- also a bit tough to get through, But the Bearnaise sauce was quite good and if you let the whole thing sit awhile- it gets easier to eat.  Love bacon? Order a side of bacon and you will get an entire bowl of the delicious stuff- plenty to share with the table.  Breakfast for two with one drink each ran about $50. Valet parking is available out front for $11. And if you are headed to the theater- they do a good job of getting you in and out in time for the curtain call.  The ambiance is typical Italian- with the rustic painted walls, pastoral scenes and wood tables and chairs that lend to the casual trattoria feeling.  A solid choice in the area, but for my money, there are places on this stretch of Halsted that I just like better.

I'm generally not a big fan of Italian food, but this is the second time in six months (the other being Gioco in the South Loop) that I have had an experience leading me to reconsider my general dislike for the cuisine originating from Europe's boot.  Vinci is a bit expensive and thus not normally a place I'd go. But, thanks to Groupon's deal, I was able to enjoy a nice meal here. We started with the roasted eggplant appetizer, which at $8-9 was quite reasonable. From there we went on to one of their pizzas and the ricotta and spinach ravioli. The pizza was rather unmemorable, but the ravioli was unbelievable. Perhaps most remarkable was that I was able to take it home and have it for lunch the next day, and it was even better the second time around!

Polenta is also one of the cheapest foods on the planet (it's dried cornmeal....), yet at Vinci, dishes with polenta cost over $15. Ridic.  The pizza here wasn't anything to write home about, either. The GF ordered the ""quattro staigioni,"" and got a pizza with something different on each slice...like one slice devoted to arugula, one to artichokes, etc. Pizzas like that are supposed to have everything mixed; who wants to shove a pile of arugula into their mouth? I had the pizza with salsiccia (Italian-style fried sausage)....well, it was more like Jewel-brand ""Italian"" sausage chopped up. With a can of nasty pizza sauce, a lot of peppers, and a few dollops of ricotta cheese. WTH - you don't leave big globs of ricotta on a supposedly Italian-style pizza. That's disgusting. There's much, much better Italian fare out there than Vinci; this place is a rip off and they're proud of it. Their operational costs vs prices must have a huge difference if they're using such inferior ingredients.

I have found that it has a casual and cozy atmosphere with good service and great pasta (always freshly made!).  It's a great place to go on a brisk or snowy night.  Further, being a vegetarian, I always appreciate the large choice of appetizers and pastas offered to me.  Honestly, I would have given them 4 stars until I went there last week and learned something critical - every single dish that otherwise appears to be vegetarian (no meat, no fish, no seafood) has chicken stock in it!!!!!  First, I was disappointed in the way I discovered it which was when I asked the server if he could modify a special to be vegetarian and he told me that the chef could not do that and not only that but not one dish on the menu was vegetarian. Second, I have to mention that no where on the menu does it state that these dishes are not vegetarian (and they honestly appear to be...no one would ever guess chicken stock would be in there) or that if you have a food allergy that you should mention it to the chef.  Now, I will take responsibility as well and say that, in the future, I will always ask whether something is vegetarian or not before I order it even it appears to be so.  Anyway, after all of that, the waiter spoke to the chef and they were only able to prepare ONE entree for me that would be vegetarian.  What a disappointment! I'd love to say I would be back but with only one choice, I doubt it will happen.",0.8926,0.835,0.103,0.062,0.6048500881834216

Went there last night for a Mother's Day dinner and our service and food was excellent.  The bread was fresh and our server Alex was very friendly, smiley and personable.   We shared appetizers of caprese salad and the portabello mushroom polenta. The caprese was more unique than most I've tasted and their were different varieties of small tomatoes (yellow, light red, orange) along with a olive oil drizzle and nice tasty cubes of mozzerella.  The portabello mushroom polenta was also very tasty and flavorful.  I loved the freshness and sauce of the mushrooms with this dish!  Our group shared a bottle of bubbly Prosecco which we also enjoyed with our meal. My boyfriend got handmade raviolis with asparagus, shrimp and ricotta.  They tasted so fresh and so delicious.  I chose something a little different and went for the Hawaiian Snapper. On top were olives and bigger sized cous cous and fresh sauteed spinach with garlic. Very big portion and very delicious. We ended the meal with a trio of gelatos and some coffee. I love the openness, airyness and ambiance of this restaurant. I will definitely be back again since I live in the neighborhood.",0.9947,0.759,0.241,0.0,0.544712643678161

After waiting quite a while (albeit with apologies with the waiter--but the restaurant was not that crowded) Paige had the cavatappi which she enjoyed, and I had the risotto with spring vegetables with goat cheese which was delicious (but I was full after apps, so I am happy to report it still tasted delicious a few hours later).  We were too stuffed and had to make our show, so we passed on dessert, though there were a few delicious sounding options. The restaurant was lovely (and much bigger than it looks; they have two party rooms) and the music they had playing was quite relaxing, so I did enjoy the ambience.

2009-02-06,1.0,"I know why this place exists: proximity to two theaters.  Went there before a show at Steppenwolf and sat at the bar while I waited for my friend. I was the youngest person in that room by about 30 years. Not a big deal, but just interesting to see their clientele.  A very elderly woman sat to my left, and she was more demanding than most diners, but she was also very friendly and appreciative of all the help that was given to her. Under his breath, the bartender muttered, ""we don't cater to old people like you...go to Boka for that."" I glared at him. Next thing I heard was a bitter waitress say, ""let's go! my guests are going to die of old age waiting for their drinks!"" My jaw dropped. She said it loud enough for me to hear, thinking I would be amused. I was not. I almost walked out at that point, but I could not get in touch with my friend.  Upon her arrival, we were sat and then we waited ten minutes before any cocktail/wine order was taken. The place was somewhat busy, but either you can manage your section, or you cannot. No diner wants a martyr as a server: ASK FOR HELP! Once he arrived, he seemed frazzled and wanted to rush us through everything. We were ready to give our order and told him we needed to be out by 7:20pm, as we had a show at 7:30pm. We chose a bottle of wine from their glass pour section...and I did, in fact, point to it on the list to show him. The manager opened the wine for us and it was the same vintage and producer I had selected. Remember that fact. Appetizers came out 22 minutes after we had ordered them. When they were delivered, I asked the server to fire our entrees, as it was almost 7pm, and I feared running late. His response, ""I've done this before, and it's not going to be an issue."" Wow. Great people skills at this place.  Entrees came at 7:10pm, and both were nasty pasta dishes with sauces probably from Sysco. Mine tasted like burned plastic, and my friend's has tiny balls of goat cheese that looked like they came out of a piping bag. Our coffee order was screwed up by our server, yet the server assistant (the only good thing about our experience was him) took the blame. When looking over the bill, I noticed that he charged us for the wrong bottle of wine (overcharged by $15). It was now 7:20pm, and he was nowhere to be found. Finally he came over and reached for our credit cards. I pointed out his mistake, he challenged me, got the menu and saw that I was right. He then said they opened the wrong bottle. I asked him to correct it. He came back with our credit cards and no changes had been made. At this point, we had less than five minutes to get to the show. It wasn't worth the argument, so for the first time in my life, I gave him a horrible tip (just barely 12%...and that's painful to do when you are in the business). All in all, the WORST dining experience I have had in Chicago. Their servers should be ashamed of the way they talk about elderly people, and their manager should get better control of his restaurant. If you DO want to be taken care of, you should go to Boka.

The hubby ordered the butternut squash gnocchi with lamb ragu and pecorino.  He devoured it and I had my own little taste test.  The gnocchi was just the right texture and I could taste the lamb (which I love) in the sauce.  There were pieces of ground lamb throughout and we were both happy with the flavor. I ordered the garginelli - pasta with shrimp, squid, grape tomatoes, basil, and spinach.  First taste had my mouth begging for more.  It was one of THE best pasta dishes (and so different!) I've had in a very long time.  I love the creativity of this dish - robust flavors, but they don't fight each other.  I'd recommend this one to anyone who asks! Dessert was zuccotta - a chocolate covered chocolate mousse with raspberry sauce.  After all the pasta, it wasn't a heavy ending.

We got to Vinci and the waiter eyed us up like a piece of meat, perhaps because we were the only people under 40 in the entire restaurant, aside from a guy with his kids. He led us to our table which was all the way in the back. I might be reading into it, but I think it was because of how we were dressed is how we ended up there. We were sitting right next to the guy with his kids... I ordered the muscle appetizer, which was delicious and full of muscles. They don't skimp on the muscles here folks. Unfortunately that was the highlight of the night. I got the risotto which was gummy and some of it was hard, definitely not very appetizing, I couldn't even finish it. I felt like a lump was growing in my stomach like a cancerous tumor. My friends enjoyed their margherita pizza they shared, that looked quite tasty. For dessert I got a vanilla/honey gelato which had a weird texture. It wasn't smooth and creamy like normal gelato, but it had a lot of chunks of ice in it making me think the stuff was phoned in. Our waiter was scarce most of the time, either because he forgot about us or he was too busy with the better-dressed patrons.

Plenty of seating here, with outdoor seating and a wine room that you can reserve for special events/parties.",0.9706,0.842,0.148,0.01,0.6495535714285714

Food was delicious. And they have my favorite dessert--panna cotta. YUM! Satisfying experience.",0.9682,0.625,0.375,0.0,0.765
2007-05-06,4.0,"Had a lovely brunch here on a Sunday afternoon.  It's a small brunch menu, but has an Italian version of all the staples: eggs benedict, fritatta, breakfast bruchetta. I has a goat cheese and spinach fritatta and it was really good.  But the best part of the meal was the raisin bread in the bread basket.  I probably could have eaten just that. The service was attentive and excellent, from the host to the waiter to the bus boys.  Plus, after brunching in Bucktown mostly lately, it sure was a treat to walk in to a restaurant and be able to be seated immediately.",0.9777,0.789,0.211,0.0,0.6070987654320987
2007-04-19,5.0,"I'm giving Vinci 5 stars because I had a fabulous meal there a while back, but especially because of their outstanding gluten-free menu.  They are one of VERY few restaurants in the city that offer gluten-free foods, and the only one that has pasta dishes.  My boyfriend has not been able to eat pasta for a couple years now (since he's been diagnosed with a wheat allergy), so it was an awesome experience for him to have options at Vinci.",0.9437,0.823,0.177,0.0,0.70375
2007-02-15,4.0,"went here last night for valentine's day. I was really impressed though i do not know if it was because it was really good or because they had stuffed artichokes on the menu. I absolutly love them and they cooked them better than my mom(SORRY but true) The fonduta sauce they added was key. My main dish was good but its hard to mess up a ragu. We had the dessert off the special menu...gelato with rasberries and presseco- DELIsh  but the serving was miniscule.  overall good food, quiet romantic setting, and good service gives vinci 4 stars from me.",0.9749,0.714,0.245,0.041,0.5100840336134452
2007-01-03,3.0,"I'm not sure why, but I often find myself at Vinci.  It probably has more to do with capacity and location than anything else. So last Friday night I found myself mysteriously back at this restaurant with my friend and her parents. I saw that they had ravioli with sage butter sauce on the menu and i LOVE that dish.  Much in the same way that I love fresh corn with butter, lobster with drawn butter, mashed potatoes with, um, you get the idea. Some people ordered salads, and calamari, but not me, I had to hold out for my ravioli with sage BUTTER sauce.   Sweet nectar of Gods.  Finally, the moment arrived and I had my entree. But you can imagine the disappointment when I realized that it was really sagebutter-cornstarch sauce!  It had a filmy gelatinous sort of texture and lacked the depth and richness that I have come to expect from such a dish. Vinci gets three stars for location and always having an open table, and for having damn good pizza.  But cost-cutting, and assembly-style seating and service make me not want to return... even though I know I'll be back some day.",0.979,0.801,0.149,0.05,0.4312091503267974
2006-10-16,4.0,"This place plays a lot on theater traffic, which is not a bad thing, but just something to know. Food is very good for the price and the service is excellent. Some of the cleanest bathrooms in the city, and great decor to look at while dinning. Not 21 so cannot drink, but the wine list looked pretty extensive and they had some nice selections. I had the duck which was cooked very well. The grilled calamari was excellent and it is worth coming back for that alone. Great location, great decor, great food, great service....not much to NOT like!",0.9966,0.553,0.43,0.017,0.6331249999999999
2006-08-11,5.0,"We have many Italian restaurants that we love in Chicago, but Vinci stands out for a few specific reasons -- one, we find it to be the most authentic Tuscan-style restaurant that we have found in terms of their cuisine. We spent some serious time in Rome, Florence, the Tuscan countryside, and Venice, and have discovered a number of restaurants in Chicago that mirror the cuisine and style of those distinct regions. 312 in the loop, and Vinci stand out as great Tuscan representatives. Vinci, with their rich savory menu items, has something for everyone -- a bolognese sauce on the Veal Tagliatelle that is a menu staple, whole wheat spaghetti with chicken, always great fish dishes that are wood-fired and moist, tremendous appetizers ranging from grilled octopus to unique bruschette and vegetables, polenta, mussels and more.  They feature phenomenal wines, including a great Montepulciano D'Abruzzo, which stood out for us because we loved the small hilltown of Montepulciano. Drinking a glass of that deep red wine, reminiscient of the other Sangiovese wines of the region, and  a mouthful of their Veal Saltimbocca with prosciutto, fontina, cremini, soft polenta, and mushroom sauce? Seriously...it's the real deal. You can taste it now, right? Finally -- the other reason is that their waitstaff are experienced and tenured -- they must really take care of them there (and the theatre crowd must keep the tips on the high end), and always friendly and warm. Their busboys always recognize us, shake our hands and say that it's nice to see us again. Fun touches like that make the service as 'authentic Italian' as the food! Like most Chicagoans -- you've tried more Italian restaurants than you care to -- but if you have not been to Vinci, it's definitely worth a visit.",0.997,0.79,0.2,0.01,0.4957530454042082
2006-04-25,5.0,"i joined an old high school friend and her fiance for dinner here one night to celebrate her birthday while she was in chicago. she picked it because vinci is one of the few restaurants that offers gluten-free meals. the meal was incredible and served promptly (the servers are quick, i think, because they're accustomed to a steppenwolf pre-theatre crowd). the wine was delicious.  all in all, the atmosphere, the food, and the service make this a 5 star restaurant. of course, my friend's fiance paid, so don't ask me about the value for the price :)",0.9432,0.845,0.155,0.0,0.53
