2017-07-10,3.0,"After years of reading amazing reviews, I finally was able to try a Tavola over the weekend. First off, the outdoor area is very cute. It feels like you're having a romantic backyard dinner with your significant other. The servers are also very friendly and enthusiastic, which further feeds into the ambience. Unfortunately, where the restaurant fell short was the food. My most favorite part of the meal was the soft and perfectly seasoned Rosemary bread. The bread carried enough flavor that extra seasoning of the olive oil was not needed. We decided to try the cacio e pepe pasta as this is generally one of my favorites. Although the flavor was on point, the texture of the pasta was a bit sticky (likely due to overcooking) and it was swimming in olive oil. A bit too much if you ask me. For entrees, we shared the chicken and short rib. The chicken and short rib were both quite tender, bit both were on the bland side and lacked flavor. Additionally, the beef was slightly gamey. The risotto that accompanied the short rib seemed overcooked as well. I do hope that it was an off day as there are literally hundreds of reviews that speak highly of the restaurant.",0.9876,0.82,0.169,0.01,0.583010752688172

2016-11-29,2.0,"First I want to say that this review is not based on food. The food is AMAZING here, but if you want your food to be delivered in the old ""Ed Debevic"" style, then please by all means, this place is for you. My friends and I wanted some good Italian and BYOB in our neighborhood. I read a review that said it was a BYOB so, we thought what a great way to splurge on the food and save on the booze. We Brought a bottle of our own wine that was already uncorked. Waitress rudely informed us that there is an extra fee for uncorking, which we said ""fine"" to even tho, bottle was already opened. The waitress brought the glasses and did not pour wine, she left it and walked away. So when the bill came with a fee of $25.00 for uncorking fee, we were kind of outraged. Not only did she not open the bottle for us, she didn't even pour it, so the fee of $25.00 was for literally just bringing the bottle on premises. Which is believe is outrageous. When my friend politely asked to see a manager to negotiate the terms of the fee, the manager said ""Just take it out of waitress' tip, we wont take it off the bill"". She was super dismissive, rude and condescending towards us. Even tho the food is really good, the service however is less than average and we will not be going there again. If i had to recommend another BYOB in the area, I would say please visit Trattoria Ultimo, they have awesome food, a low corking fee for BYOB and staff is super nice!!! Unfortunately, I wont be coming back and neither will any of my friends, because in such a big city there are a ton of really good Italian restaurants, but its hard to find a place with great staff, that make the experience special.

Being a pretty depressing day, I wasn't sure I even wanted to go to dinner, but my husband had found A Tavola because I love gnocchi and it seemed like a nice, low key place. I decided to keep our reservation, and we arrived for dinner around 8:30. It's a quaint little space and there were only a few tables and just one server, Morgan. She asked if we were celebrating something, not sure how she knew? Maybe because we made a late reservation on a Wednesday night like cool kids, but she let us pick any table we wanted and we grabbed a nice one in the corner.  I'm a big red wine drinker and she was so helpful in explaining the by the glass options. She even brought 3 bottles over and let us taste them before we ordered, which I thought was fantastic, I've never had a restaurant do that before. They were honestly all delicious, but I settled on a great Chianti. We began with the pear salad, which was a generous portion and well dressed. There was a good amount of pear and parmesan, which was nice and sharp. We also had the rosemary focaccia and olives, which were great. We ordered the gnocchi and the cacio e pepe, both favorites of mine. The gnocchi was light and fluffy and the sage atop was nice and crispy. I really enjoyed it but my one slight criticism is that I wish it had a LITTLE more of the brown butter and sage sauce. It felt just a little dry. The cacio e pepe was well cooked with a nice chew, and very peppery. Then we had the short rib with risotto, and OMG, yes. I came here for the pasta but I'm so glad we ordered this dish. The short rib was flavorful and tender, and went perfectly with the saffron risotto. The rice had a nice bite to it and wasn't soggy at all. We basically licked the plate clean on this one.  We were so full but being a birthday, decided to have the flourless chocolate torta. It was delicious and warm, like a dense brownie, with amazing fresh whipped cream on top. Morgan even put a candle in it for me. I had such a nice time at A Tavola. Sometimes it's nice to go to trendy, sceney restaurants but I love a place like A Tavola that's relaxing, personal, and has well executed classic dishes.

2016-09-26,5.0,"A Tavola. Let me preface this review by stating that I have been dying for a vacation in the Tuscan countryside for a while now (and I'm hoping to go next year!). If you are in the same boat, don't want to wait and want a bit of incredible Italian cooking, do come to A Tavola! We went here in early July when the Chicago weather is beautifully warm and perfect for eating outside. A Tavola has this gorgeous courtyard where we sat on a double date with another couple who had highly recommended this place to us. This place is known for its gnocchi and, my goodness, what fine gnocchi it really is! I have no hesitation in recommending the gnocchi to anyone who wants good, authentic pasta. My wife is a die-hard gnocchi fan and she loved it (so it MUST be good!). The gnocchi was perfectly soft and fluffy, and the browned sage butter drizzled over it was amazing!  I (grudgingly) shared my Bistecca Fiorentina which is a Tuscan specialty. It is a bone-in center cut ribeye that was grilled to perfection with olive oil and salt. We had ours done medium-rare. Don't even bother ordering the bistecca if you like your meat well-done. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the server glares at you for making such a request. The bistecca is definitely to be shared between two hungry people since it is massive!  I have read rave reviews of their Panna Cotta but we could not stomach a dessert after the decadence that was the main course.  Our server was super polite, patient (we took ages to decide on food) and informative. She helped us with wine pairings as well, and the four of us finished off a lovely bottle of velvety Montepulciano d'Abruzzo which complemented the bistecca incredibly well. Dining outside at A Tavola will transport you from 2148 W Chicago Avenue to a beautiful Tuscan hilltop with rolling vineyards and olive groves sprawling out before you as far as the eye can see.

2016-08-23,4.0,"Holy A Tavola! What delicious food can be had at A Tavola.  It's pricey. It's dark & romantic. It's Italian food done really well. Service is very attentive & professional though they messed up our order, then charged us for their mess up.  My friends and I started with a simple Caprese Salad ($10) which was enjoyable. 4 slices of tomato, 4 slices of cheese, so everyone in my group had one piece of each. Though this was fine, it could be skipped on our next trip in.  We ordered each pasta on the menu and this is where a discrepency was made. Instead of being one of each of the 3 pastas, we were brought just 2 pastas with 1 bowl of one and 2 bowls of another! Not sure why they would think we'd get two bowls of one type. When we asked, they said, ah yes, it's coming right out. Well the one they forgot was very al dente (aka rush order) and the extra pasta was not removed from our bill. We did not love having to pay for their mistake. That being said, the pastas were delicious. The Gnocchi ($18 or $12) with browned sage butter & parmesan was my personal favorite, done really well with just the right amount of cheese with fabulously done pasta.  We needed a red sauce dish of course so ordered the Tagliatelle Bolognese ($18 or $12) - a combination of ground pork and beef in a san marzano tomato sauce. I don't normally love tomato based sauce dishes but actually loved this! This was however the dish they forgot about so the noodles were a bit undercooked. My friend says Tonnarelli Cacio e Pepe ($18 or $12) in the most terrible way possible with a heavy accent. Though we can't stand him saying the name of this dish, we totally could stand the dish itself.  'Twas traditional Roman dish with cheese & pepper. Very cheesy. Very peppery. Very good. All the pastas were wonderful but the pièce de résistance of the meal was the Sangiovese Braised Beef Short Rib for $28. The meat just fell off the bone, so tender and packed full of flavor. The dish as a whole came together in perfect harmony being plated atop a bed of saffron topped with a horseradish gremolata. Every element of this dish was mind blowing and I highly recommend this pricey but well worth it entree!  Between four of us & splitting a bottle of wine ($46 bottle of pinot), we spent $200.

Everything was good- but it wasn't great or amazing as I figured it would be at such a special establishment. I thought the ambiance would be fancier since it is a small space and sometimes hard to get reservations.  We were running a little late and we called to let them know that we would be about 15 minutes later than our reservations. The woman on the phone himmed and hawed and acted like they would not be able to accommodate us because they were booked. When we got there they had a private party (gathering) in the main dining room waiting to go upstairs so we didn't have the option of sitting inside anyway! When we went outside there were plenty of tables left!  The food was good but I've had way better Authentic Italian in Chicago. They have a limited menu so my husband chose to have the veal steak which was on special. The entrees run around $30 so we figured it would be the most $10-$15 more. Well don't figure- always ask because when we got the check just his veal was $70!!!! We fine fine a lot but never have we paid so much for a cut of meat.  If it would have been the best veal ever it would have been one thing but it was very fatty.  The gnocchi was ok but it was very large and it doesn't come with a lot of sauce on it so it came out dry. The Bolognese was very good.   Overall a very disappointing date night so I wouldn't suggest it for dining. Way better options in Chicago.",0.9919,0.78,0.173,0.048,0.46331006493506494

Upon ordering food, she informed us their pasta maker had broke that day and the only pasta (from the gnocchi, bolognese, and cacio e pepe) available was gnocchi, although the bolognese sauce was available with the gnocchi.

We were also disappointed as two of our party were vegetarian and were looking forward to the gnocchi and cacio e pepe. Another was looking forward to the lamb read about on here but it was missing from the menu. We ended up ordering the arugula salad and gnocchi for the vegetarians, and gnocchi bolognese and the short rib for the others. The gnocchi was good, but not exceptionally so. The bolognese sauce was delicious, however. The short rib was fatty and the risotto was slightly bland. The salad had a little too much vinegar -- it burned my throat. We ordered the panna cotta for dessert and it was heavenly, definitely the best I've had outside of Italy. Overall, we had a good experience because of the service, wine, and dessert, but I probably wouldn't go back.",0.9843,0.744,0.174,0.082,0.49726190476190485

For entrees, I had the chicken and he had the braised short ribs. Both were falling off the bone! The desserts- the lemon tart and chocolate torte- were mouth-watering.

2016-01-28,5.0,"What a GEM!  I came here during 2016 Restaurant week with my boyfriend and we were seated at an intimate table in their small one-room restaurant. A Tavola is located inside a two-flat on Chicago Avenue, and the restaurant has about 10 tables total. It really feels as though you're eating in a friend's living room, and that's part of the charm. The atmosphere is quiet and perfect for a low key and delicious date night.  Although we came during restaurant week, we decided to stick to their regular menu. Upon sitting we were given their house focaccia bread alongside some olives. The focaccia here is standout! With our server's guidance, we ordered the arugula salad and mixed roasted vegetables as starters. Both were very fresh, and the roasted vegetables were cooked to perfection. The arugula salad was served with tomatoes, parmesan, and walnuts-- a basic salad with fresh ingredients but nothing incredibly standout.  The next courses are where the restaurant really shines: pastas and entrees. We opted to share two pasta dishes, the gnocchi and the tagliatelle bolognese. Both dishes were UNREAL. The gnocchi is quite easily the best, most fluffy gnocchi I've ever had. A light dish, which is virtually unheard of when describing gnocchi. As for their tagliatelle, I think I might have liked this even more than the gnocchi if possible. Their bolognese sauce is the perfect balance between tomato-y, creamy, and sweet. Their homemade noodles make all the difference, and I would put this up there as one of my all time favorite pasta experiences. Finally, we shared the short rib with saffron risotto. The short rib was fall off the bone perfection, and the saffron rice had a creaminess that balanced the meat perfectly. I would highly recommend this to those looking for a serious Italian meal with great ambiance and a smaller price tag than some of its downtown counterparts.

Unfortunately I would only give it two and a half, maybe three stars. This is not authentic Italian. I repeat not authentic Italian. I've traveled all over Italy on numerous occasions and have had meals from our close Italian family friends. The pros it is quaint and small or I should say intimate inside. The wait staff is friendly. Has ambiance.  The cons, make sure you have enough time to dine; It took us 3 hours to get a beverage order, salads and shared pasta, a shared entree a shared dessert and coffees.  The salads were oily and didn't have the right balance of dressing or citrus to counter the oil. We shared a small gnocchi in sage butter, but was missing fresh sage. The veal special we ordered was ample size, meat was good, but nothing to rave. Garlic spinach was oily we had to ask for lemon to balance the flavor and the Rosemary potatoes were too crispy they were almost dry.  The chocolate torte was good, tasted like the decadent brownies you can get at my pie pizza but thinner.  I am truly disappointed I cannot give a better review.

After coming from a rowdy Cubs crowd at Fat Pour, the dim lighting and quiet murmurs perfectly set the mood for the cozier intimacy one would expect from a proper date night.  We weren't sure that we wanted a three course dinner, but the menu was too good to not splurge.  We started with the roasted vegetables and mushroom plate.  The portobello soaked in balsamic vinaigrette and italian spices for 24 hrs and melted in our mouths.  The vegetables were tasty as expected, especially the giant fennel bulb.  We knew we had to get the gnocchi, even though neither of us are huge gnocchi fans because of how dense and filling they are. The gnocchi here are as light as marshmallows and tasty like none I've ever had. I also got the tagliatelle bolognese, and we both agreed that was our favorite of the night, the bf because it's what he thinks of as Italian food, and me because it reminds me of home cooked meals on Sundays with my Italian family.  I had the Lake Superior whitefish with a lemon caper reduction and my bf had the Italian chicken.  Both were wonderful and although I felt a little guilty doing so, I took half of my meal home so I could enjoy it the next day.   The wines by the glass are limited but all so nice, it is obvious that there was a lot of thought put into the drink menu.   If nothing else, what I'll wrap up with is this: of the three tables around us, we heard each say, at different points of them meal, ""this reminds me of when I was in Italy.""  And I agree.  It was a meal worthy of the Tuscan countryside, or the Roman city center.",0.9932,0.833,0.147,0.02,0.5514239028944912

Our server was very warm and friendly.  She gave Hubby great wine recommendations.  We started with the delicious plate of roasted vegetables.  That was Hubby's favorite dish.  We decided not only to try the Tonnarelli Cacio e Pepe but to split the ginormous Bistecca Fiorentina (the 32 oz bone-in-center cut ribeye for two, or in our case at that time, for three).  Our server let us add a side of the Gnocchi with browned sage butter and parmesan as a side to the meat so we could try two different types of handmade pasta.  We ordered the meat medium for me, but in hindsight, I wish we went with medium rare since the meat was so thick it ended up charred on the outside. It was a lot and we had to take the rest home.  I was disappointed in the Cacio e Pepe as the pasta looked and had the texture of crinkly thin ramen noodles and their version added a lot of olive oil.  The Gnocchi was flavorful.  For dessert we split the Torta di Mele Rovesciata (baked apple pastry).  It took them longer than usual to make it so the server apologized for the delay.  It was just okay, not worth the wait for it.

I say that because you should be aware that you are gonna wait if you come to A Tavola...much like meals served at ristorantes in Italy, we would have been at A Tavola for three hours had we not pushed the staff because we were paying for a babysitter and didn't think it would take so long.  We ordered all of our food (a couple of salads, pasta and mains) last night at about 7:50 PM...the pasta didn't come to the table until 8:56 PM, and realizing that we were far from actually getting the entrees, we mentioned our 10 PM time constraint to the server.  ""Good to know; we'll put the order in for the entrees now.""  It's cool that everything is made by hand and the quality is worth the time, but just know that you can't blow through A Tavola...expect to stay a while.

2015-04-15,4.0,"I attended the April cooking class, where we made mushrooms, roast chicken, gnocchi, and the apple tart. There were 24 of us and the staff was incredibly accommodating. They offered us glasses of wine, although they failed to mention each glass was $15. Just for that, I'm docking one star. I'd rather the class cost $10 or $15 more and have them include a glass. Anyway, Chef Dan is a really nice guy and knows a lot about cooking. He merely stuffed the cavity of the chicken with fresh herbs, lemon, and kosher salt, tied it tight, and just stuffed it into the oven at 500 degrees. He invited us to participate in the process, from peeling apples and potatoes, to chopping herbs, to rolling the gnocchi dough. The bread they served us had some salt and rosemary on it, and we dipped into some extra virgin olive oil. Honestly, I probably would have been happy with just getting the bread recipe. It was so amazing. The chicken tasted fine, but I honestly felt like some salt and pepper would have made it much better. It's amazing to think that the chicken was really the after thought of the meal. I can barely describe the oyster and portabella mushrooms and how good they were. All I know is we made nowhere near enough to satisfy the table. The gnocchi tasted unlike anything I've ever had. It tasted incredibly fresh and the sauce made of butter and sage leaves made it a very satisfying dish. The apple tart was so simple, just butter, sugar, golden delicious apples, and pastry. Before we put the tart in the oven, the apples were cooked on the stove with the butter and sugar, so it created a caramel sauce, of sorts. Topped with some fresh whipped cream, it was a remarkable dessert. The meal was also served with grilled vegetables, garlic spinach, and an amazing savory bread pudding with pancetta. The total, with wine and gratuity, came to $220. It's a hefty amount of money to spend for the class, but it was a good experience and fun to do once. That said, I would still want to come back and try the steak!",0.9975,0.805,0.19,0.005,0.6206349206349207

2015-03-23,3.0,"I am in b/t a 2 and 3 star review but overall I would not recommend this restaurant. It's cute on the outside but the inside felt pretty ordinary to me with not much decor to make it feel cozy (there are only 10 tables and its pretty quiet so you can hear everyone) or anything to make it unique. We also had a table right by the door which wasn't that great.. every time someone opened the door we felt the cold breeze and as people came in they waited by our table which was awkward. Our waitress was nice but she wasn't experienced, causing some problems later on. I think at a restaurant like this (which is expensive) waiters should be experienced. Two people at my table ordered the rack of lamb medium rare; their lamb came medium well which was really disappointing. Between our 2nd entree and 3rd (their are 3 courses) it took 45 minutes to get our food, which is really unacceptable (the table next to us, who came in 30 minutes after we did, got their entree before we did and they also ordered 3 courses). They did provide us with a free entree b/c the lamb was cooked incorrectly which was nice but still disappointing b/c neither person in my party could really eat their entree. Also my mom ordered a side of spinach with her pasta and they forgot it and brought it to her like it was a dessert course (the timing was very awkward). My arugula salad was simple but very good and I enjoyed my pasta. Just very disappointed in how they cooked the lamb and it took to long to get our food.

The room is storefront small, with no separate bar. Make a reservation if you're coming on a busy night. Atmosphere is the kind you see in movies when there's a scene set in an Italian restaurant. White-cloth tables that seat four, in a room that's full but not crammed. The staff are professionals experienced in the offerings. Our server gave us an expert introduction to their menu and wine list, the kind of familiarity with the food and wine that can only come from working in a restaurant for a long time. The menu is short, varied but true to style, and suggests a specific set of courses: salad, then small pasta course, then main. And of course dessert if you like. My wife ordered just salad and pasta, then nibbled a bit at the serves-two veal our friend and I shared for our main, and we all left happy. We chose mostly house specialties for our introduction to the place. Everything from the fresh, herbed bread to the homemade dessert was excellent. For her pasta course my wife ordered the lamb, and gave me a taste. I'm picky about lamb, but this was just right, only the faintest hint that distinguished it from other meats. I want to try their lamb main. Friend and I each had gnocchi as our pasta. House specialty, best I've ever tasted, the end. The veal was also superb. Topped with prosciutto and served off-bone, on a platter with sliced potatoes topped in cheese, and a mound of oh what spinach. Perfectly cooked to just the right doneness, with garlic that's forward but not overpowering. Just excellent, I wish I could make my own spinach turn out like that.

Second coarse failed all of us.  Two of us had the chicken.  Both where dry and bland (I hate to say that because I love a good chicken).   In our party we also had a beef tenderloin that was ordered medium and came our rare (they comped our check, which goes back to the great service) and all you can taste on the lamb was the chargrilled outer coat.

From this experience I cannot recommend A Tavola for their entrées, but maybe for their pasta and salads.  On a positive note when we mentioned the problem with the dried out fish to the waiter he did seem to talk to the kitchen, and took the $40 charge for the fish off the bill.  The waiter did also mention that it was not the regular chef.",0.7532,0.855,0.082,0.063,0.4832992007992008

The servers were amazing, so friendly and just all around made you feel at home. Food came out fast after placing the order. THE FOOD! They give you focaccia bread to start which is so good and the keep it coming if you finish it. I started with the bolognese and my wife had the pear salad. Both were awesome, especially the bolognese. My wife had the chicken for her main and it was extremely good, crispy skin and tender chicken inside. I had the spare ribs with risotto, again amazing. Fall of the bone meat. If I have any complaints it would be this. The atmosphere is a little quiet I'd say. Mainly older people, still a good vibe though. The other thing I would warn people who are unfamiliar with italian cuisine is that the pastas are meant to be a first course and they are small, so most likely you will get a pasta and a main. It will run you about $35-$50 for both. Food: 5 Service: 5 (but i'd give it at 10) Atmosphere: 4 Value: 4.5 Will be returning.",0.9814,0.848,0.126,0.026,0.5513888888888889

She thought we were going to some fast food Chinese place for a moment, because that was the only sign of a restaurant on the block.  The place was very romantic, low lit and we were greeted and seated right away. We both shared the Pear Salad and Gnocchi to start. The salad was fresh and very tasty. The gnocchi was fresh and hand made that same day. The gnocchi melted in your mouth like butter and had such excellent flavor.  I ordered the braised beef short rib with risotto and she ordered the grilled beef tenderloin. Both of these dishes were to die for. We were making so many mmmm sounds when eating. We also shared a bottle of the Belpoggio, Rosso di Motalcino 2010. This wine was excellent and paired nicely with our entire meal. Our waitress was so kind and I overheard she was responsible for ordering a tavola's wines.

2013-10-10,3.0,"50 minutes for entrees. YIKES! You must try the gnocchi, OMG it's so delicious. And the Lamb Ragu, my husband hates lamb but loved that dish, I woke up today craving it. That being said, things go down hill from there. My husband and I stopped in on a Tuesday evening a little after 6 pm. It was my birthday and I LOVE Italian food, since a tavola is with in walking distance to our place we figured we give it a chance. When we arrived we were the only table and were told by someone that they weren't allowing people to sit on the patio because they didn't want to move them later when it got to cold. Okay, it's a Tuesday, really you can't sit us where we'd like to be sat. Okay, whatever, lets move on.  Our waiter is soft spoken and mumbles, so its tough to understand what he's saying sometimes and there is younger guy following him, although we have no idea why. He just stands there and stares. It's a little weird. My guess is he's training but I don't know maybe tell the table what's going on cause it was very creepy at times. The waiter explains the menu and how it's meant to be ordered which is fine by us. We order a bottle of wine and figure out what we want to eat while we wait for our wine. While the waiter is pouring the wine he takes our order and gets it mixed up a couple times, you could have just waited until you were done pouring the wine to take the order. We are still the only table. We order a lot of food, thinking leftovers will be yummy for lunch the next day. 2 salads, the gnocchi and lamb ragu and 2 entrees. The pork shank which is one of their specials that evening and the beef spare ribs. About 10 minutes after we place the order our salads arrive. Great perfect. Yummy salads, we enjoy them. We finish those and the plates are removed, at this point a couple of tables are now full and 10 minutes later our pasta comes out. They are small portion pasta and the waiter warned us so I wasn't surprised. I mean price wise it's a bit silly but they were both so good that I didn't care. We finish the pasta (which wasn't the original plan, we were going to take some of the pasta home but) they take the plates away and now we have 50 minutes to wait for our entrees. I get that they want you to relax and enjoy your meal but seriously. If the dishes are going to take that long then I suggest you tell the patrons that before they order. If I would have known I would have said screw it I'll eat more pasta. FINALLY our food comes out and my beef short ribs are swimming in a pond of brown broth. It doesn't look very appetizing seeing as the risotto is now drenched in a lot of liquid, but I try the food anyway. The beef ribs are very salty and the risotto is almost hard, like they've some how separated into these little bricks of rice. My husband says his pork is okay but not as good at the pork I had a few days ago at a different place on the north side. SO after all that waiting, we only take a few bites of our food and then sit for 25 minutes with our plates in front of us waiting for our waiter to return. At this point there are now 8 tables and our waiter is the only one on, so he's running around like crazy. Finally he comes by to check on us and asks if we're still working. We say no and he offers a dessert menu, my husband agrees that we'll take a look. Now we're not dessert people but we usually get something to share on one of our birthday's but this time I said no. I turned down my husbands offer for an after dinner drink, espresso, dessert, all of it because I knew it would take forever to get it. We were now out of wine and again it took 20 minutes for the waiter to come back and ask if we wanted any dessert. At that point my husband handed the waiter his credit card and asked for the bill because I was over it.  I really wanted to love this place. Especially after eating the gnocchi and lamb ragu but the price is high the service is slow and I just didn't feel welcomed at all. It felt very stuffy, so we'll see if we go back.

2013-08-13,2.0,"A friend and I visited a tavola on Saturday, August 3, 2013 for dinner.  I have dined at the restaurant several times but never experienced such disappointment before.  We were seated outdoors on a lovely night.  The service was unbelievably bad.  We were told they had a full bar (in the past I ususally drank wine).  The olives they served with the martini were tiny and tasteless, they were out of tomato juice and bloody mary mix. Rather shocking  for a full service bar!  We shared 2 pastas which were delicious (the gnocchi and the black pepper linguine).  The waitress has told us to ""save room"" for the delicious desserts.  We then shared the short ribs over risotto.  Fabulous!  While we were waiting for our dishes we happened to look across the patio where a waiter was serving wine to a table of 6.  As he placed the wine glasses down, he must have noticed a spot on one.  He turned his back to his table facing us, and proceeded to wipe the glass on his shirt, all the while chewing gum.  He then placed the glass in front of one of the diners.  It was sickening to watch.  Back to us.  We ordered coffee with cream and were served lukewarm coffee and pitchers of milk.  We asked again for cream and were told you had no cream for coffee, only milk.  As she put the pitchers of milk on the table, she spilled from both pitchers and never bothered to clean the mess.  When we complained that the coffee was not hot, she poured from another pot and spilled the coffee all over the cup and saucer making a bigger mess.  We could not pick up the cup without the coffee getting all over our clothes.  When I called her back she was annoyed - the table was a mess and she had not attempted to clean it up. While our waitress was trying, the young food runner was so inept, it was hard to believe she was hired by your restaurant that I always believed to be one of the ""good"" ones.  We ordered the apple tart at the young ladies suggestion, and asked for it warm  with vanilla ice cream.  We were told they was no ice cream as you had no freezer. It took 16 minutes for the tart to be served with whipped cream that was melted and runny.   What happened to the wonderful restaurant I used to frequent with James Wood who was director of the Art Institute?  While the food is still ok, your staff is an  abomination - a waiter who chews gum while serving, a food runner who spills all over the table and fails to clean it up?  Can I ever return?  I think not....",-0.7703,0.795,0.094,0.111,0.5466408268733851

There were not a lot gnocchis for the price and the other dish we had (I forget now what it was) was also kinda small. We did also have the grilled vegetable platter app so that held us over for the night. But I guess if you are on a date and money is no object, this is pretty good. Apparently their patio gives out free money or something because while we were happily eating indoors, every party that came in asked for the patio and was disappointed when it was already full. Some even lamented they made a reservation just for the patio, but as the hostess repeatedly said, the patio is not guaranteed and first come first serve. Many a date was ruined that night, I assume. So if you are into pillowy soft gnocchis, I guess you could start here so you have a reference point.

I liked that! We started off with the ever-so-famous gnocchi with brown sage butter & parmesan (airy and fluffy, but a little bland, and the crispy sage leaves kind of wigged me out), and the Sangiovese braised lamb ragu with tagliatelle (which was just way too lamb-y/game-like for me). These come in smaller portions, so it's a nice size to share between two people instead of an actual 'entree' size. For the main entrees, I had the oven roast chicken served with a savory bread pudding & garlic spinach (the chicken was cooked to perfection, great to dip in a bit of salt, and the garlic spinach was fantastic; I'd probably wanted an extra helping of the spinach rather than the bread pudding), and the braised beef short rib over saffron risotto topped with a raw horseradish, lemon zest, and parley gremolata (the brasied beef was alright, but a little too bland; the risotto was way too runny). For dessert, we had the panna cotta - it tasted like a thicker version of flan, with a thick texture like cream cheese, tasting like an unmeltable version of ice cream of vanilla and caramel - I really enjoyed this, even though the texture was a little odd. The prices were decent, and the restaurant itself is cute - people opted to sit out in the patio with the nice weather, but I preferred the well AC-ed dining room. The bathroom was like a freezer, and I LOVED it!  I do like the fact that they have a 'limited menu,' in which the chef focuses on the dishes with the 'best ingredients.'

(New relationship- too nervous to come off as high maintenance, which I most likely am) His short ribs were great, much more flavorful. We got a bottle of red and spent probably $160 with tip. Otherwise, while nice, and tucked away, the jazz playing via cd on an old boombox under a server's station where we were seated upstairs kept skipping/stopping, and the waiter kept having to futz with it.

I called for a reso and was told that we'd be seated upstairs.  No problem.  When we arrived, we were actually seated in the main dining room, which was also terrific.  It was a very cold evening when we dined.  Everytime the door opened, we got a terrible draft.  They have curtains that separate the main dining room from the foyer, but they were held open, not shut, which would have helped immensely, we were very cold the entire time, which really ruins the dining experience. The service was fine, nothing stellar.  They did a great job giving us new silverware between each course, and new plates.  At one point I was given a dirty plate and had to ask for a new one.  Another time one server brought us new plates, then immediately another server came and removed them, even though we were awaiting our pasta course.  Then somebody else came and brought us new plates again. One thing I didn't like was that I could hear the only female server (who wasn't our server) always stressing - I could hear her talking stressfully to somebody about the computer screen, and another time to the bus boy/back waiter about getting the table cleared, and several other times about various items.  I noticed once that one of the other servers was running food out for her and she didn't know which table it belonged to, she was asking him ""did the kitchen tell you which table that was for????""  I felt like her volume forced me to be involved in a lot of her drama, and she wasn't even our server.  I'd suggest that she keep it down a bit and keep the drama either off the dining room floor or quieter as it did invade our dining experience a bit. We had the green salad, the chicken and vegetable risotto and split both of those.  Both were delicious.  My husband ordered the beef, which he ordered medium and it came out medium rare.  I ordered the fish special, which was described as having a crispy crust, and didn't.  It was still delicious, but wasn't as it was described.  My husband had a glass of red wine.  Our tab was $100.

The restaurant is literally an old house and was really cute inside with a nice atmosphere.  We started with a Tuscan blend wine which was delicious. The menu is designed to be a 3 course meal- first an appetizer, then a pasta course and ending with an entree.  We opted not to get any appetizers, mainly because nothing really jumped out on the menu.  For the pasta course, I ordered the gnocchi with brown butter and sage and my husband got the lamb ragu. I had high expectations for the gnocchi after reading various other yelp reviews and while I thought they were good, I have had better gnocchi elsewhere. They were super light and pillowy - so much so that my fork broke them apart when I tried to eat them. My husband's ragu was the show stealer. It was such tender braised lamb and a great sauce. Also it was a much larger portion. For our entrees I got the duck leg with garlic spinach and potatoes and my husband the braised short rib with saffron risotto. Again, his dish was by far the winner. My duck was overcooked. The middle was pink however the ends were well done and basically inedible. The spinach was the highlight of my dish. On the other hand, the braised short rib and risotto was amazing. So tender, so flavorful and the risotto was perfect. If I had ordered what my husband did, I probably would give this place 4 stars.  Also our service was very slow. We were there for an hour and 45 minutes when we only ordered 2 courses. We were nursing our bottle of wine.

2012-09-30,2.0,"If you hate food with seasoning, you will love A Tavola. A Tavola might be Chicago's most boring restaurant. Based on my diet, it is not for me and I would not return. I eat fish but not meat, and that severely limited my options here. What I could eat was, at best, unmemorable and, at worst, completely tasteless. Meat eaters might have an entirely different experience. We started with a very good grilled mushroom appetizer (one of only two appetizers I could eat, the other being a boring preparation of mixed vegetables). I then had very nice, if unremarkable, gnocchi with sage and brown butter (the only pasta on the menu I could eat). My entree was the fish of the day (again, my only choice), an unidentified whitefish served with unseasoned (?!) potatoes and broccoli. This unbelievably unimaginative preparation was high priced hospital food. Easily the most bland dish I have ever had in Chicago and possibly my life. I could not believe how tasteless and boring the dish was, especially for this price. Given that I have eaten every item I can on A Tavola's menu, there is no reason for me to return. The patio was nice and service was friendly and attentive. Unfortunately, it doesn't make up for the lame menu.

As we awkwardly made our exit, we speculated on what could have triggered such an unprofessional and rude reception.  It might have been dress code -- though there are no signs that rule out flipflops on a late summer evening and probably they would have informed us that we didn't meet their dress code.   Or, it may be that one of us is black?!

2012-09-09,4.0,"If you want a lovely, simple dining experience with solid, delicious food, then a tavola is your best bet.  No hype or frills - just an old fashioned  New York style Italian restaurant with accessible, perfectly cooked food.  The decor was classic with a few black and white photographs and lovely drapes with hints of gold - the sort of classic contemporary that's comforting and never tries too hard. We had the gnocchi as one of our first courses, and I can honestly say it's the best gnocchi I've every had.  I sorrowfully told my boyfriend that there's no way the gnocchi can be topped  - I was right, but the grilled leg of lamb from the specials menu came pretty damn close. I asked for medium rare, and goddamn it, they gave me medium rare.  Perfect lamb. My boyfriend got the roasted chicken, which I wasn't impressed with, but he liked it.   The best part of our meal was the ambiance - this is a seriously romantic restaurant - the type where you can lean into your lover and hold hands and whisper and giggle. Cons: The roasted chicken came with a savory bread pudding, which was way too salty and buttery and greasy - quite below par for the rest of our meal, which was delicious.  Neither of us could stomach a second bite. The service definitely needed some improvement.  We had a reservation, and yet we still had to wait twenty minutes until someone even came by to get our drink order. When the waiter finally did attend to us, he said ""uh, has anyone come to help your guys or taken your drink order yet?  Oh.  I guess I'll be your waiter tonight.""  The service was slow for the rest of the night, too, which was fine, because who cares when the food is good?  But when the waiter did come by, he was flustered and rushed.  He also didn't check on us even once after we got our first course, or even once after we got our entrees.  To be fair, when we got our bill, they hadn't charged us for my single glass of wine, and when I pointed it out, he said ""because things were crazy tonight.""  I appreciate it, and I'm glad they were aware of the problem, but I'd rather have paid for my wine and had good service. Also, as yelper Shradha pointed out, they didn't really have good vegetarian options.  We weren't vegetarian, but we were scoping out the place for future visits with my parents, who are, and I can be assured that this isn't a place to bring them.  It's 2012, and vegetarians usually love Italian food - they should try to have something to accommodate them.",0.9978,0.742,0.206,0.052,0.5260260572760573

That's not to say that I don't enjoy Italian food (especially cooked by someone who's grew up /lived there) but I find the stuff we get in restaurants in the US to be bland. I thought A Tavola would be different but no such luck. We started with grilled mushrooms, which were excellent and tasted like a steak. Next we moved onto the gnocchi, which was good, but not the best I ever had. I was still on my short-rib kick of 2010-2011, and ordered the short ribs and saffron risotto. Talk about huge disappointment: 2/3 of the short ribs were fat (and I hate the texture of fat in my mouth) and the risotto, while sounding good in theory, was goopy with an odd aftertaste. For dessert, we had the panna cotta and something else. Not good that I can't remember the ""something else"" because I have a mega sweet tooth. Overall, I'd be hard pressed to come back.

The texture was the right amount of firm but smooth and the flavors were bold but not overwhelming. gnocchi with browned sage butter & parmesan - I am not a gnocchi person but I have to say this was an excellent dish.  The gnocchi were melt in your mouth and of course, how can you go wrong with browned sage butter and parmesean? I will say I am glad we split the dish though, because the portion came out to be the perfect amount of food.  If we each had our own plate of gnocchi I think it would be way too rich, so I definitely recommend sharing. sangiovese braised beef short rib over saffron risotto with horseradish gremolata  - This dish is responsible for the low, 2 start rating.  I did not think this dish was done well at all.  The short rib was very tender/fall off of the bone but it was so fatty that I think it was a larger percentage fat than meat.  The risotto was too aldente and not very pleasant to eat.  The saffron was a nice touch and worked well flavor-wise but was not enough to save this dish from being anything but mediocre. Panna Cotta - I was extremely excited to have the panna cotta here! I love panna cotta and I've had it many different ways with varying levels of firmness/creaminess and have not had one yet that I did not enjoy.  Unfortunately, I did not enjoy the panna cotta at a travola.  It was weird...firm and kind of GUMMY??! The flavor was...blah and forgettable (literally, I can't remember if it was vanilla? coconut?).   The service was very good here and that, along with the neat ambience and tasty appetizers makes a tavola deserving of a 2 start rating in my opinion.",0.9977,0.766,0.185,0.049,0.6684211706660687
2011-10-23,3.0,"The food at A Tavola did not live up to the hype. The pear salad was lackluster. The brown sage butter gnocchi was decent, but the sage over-powered the whole dish, I've had better gnocchi at a handful of other restaurants. My braised beef short rib was good but exactly half of it was pure fat and bone that I could not eat. The risotto that came with it was runny and had a weird flavor to it because of the lemon zest. My dining companion liked his beef tenderloin. Good wine selection. We decided not to have dessert.  A meal here can be quite expensive and I'd say your money is better spent somewhere else. The menu is extremely limited and if you have a limited menu, each entree better be phenomenal, but this was not the case. Nothing tasted authentically Italian to me.  Atmosphere and dress are casual. You may have trouble finding this place, it looks like a house from the outside, no sign. It is in fact a house turned into a restaurant, the small living room is basically the dining area. Just a handful of tables with slow turnover so make sure you have reservations.

2011-10-18,4.0,"On a recent Saturday night in October 20011 my wife, my son and his wife, and I celebrated our son's birthday at A Tavola as first-time customers.  Dinner reservations were made with Joseph who also acted as our host upon our arrival.  Until we stepped into the restaurant, I didn't know that it has a large outdoor patio in the rear.  Although we thought we would be dining inside, after we saw the patio and it being a beautiful evening, we asked if we could be accommodated outside.  The patio was completely occupied but Joseph said that he would try to get us seated as soon as possible.  In the meantime he provided a well located table inside the restaurant, and we were served excellent drinks.  About 15 minutes later, Joseph led us to a very comfortable table in the patio where we subsequently very much enjoyed a well prepared and leisurely paced meal.  We were served by Kevin who was very professional and congenial.  We started with a couple of very tasty appetizers that included grilled mushrooms and vegetables.  Next, we shared an order of the gnocchi and the tagliatelle Bolognese that were both excellent.  Highlights among the entrées were the white fish and the braised beef short rib.  On the recommendation of Kevin the roasted turkey breast was ordered, and it turned out to be outstanding.  The only disappointment was that the sides for the entrées, specifically the potatoes, spinach, and other vegetables, were somewhat bland and unremarkable. We found A Tavola's main dining room to be very charming, and the outdoor patio was large and private with well spaced tables.  Overall, the meal was very good and the service was attentive, friendly, and very accommodating.  We had a great time, and we will certainly be return patrons.",0.9965,0.792,0.195,0.013,0.5372799422799425

After that, the man did something with oyster mushrooms that made them so flavorful and wonderful... it was one of the standouts on a giant table of delicious food.

By giving it three stars I don't mean to say its average, but rather for the hype and the prices its only ok.  Perhaps I expected too much. After reading all the amazing reviews on here I went to A Tavola for my anniversary with high hopes. I appreciated that they had a short but delicious sounding menu, my hope would be with only a select few meals they could really make each exceptional. Sadly, this was not the case. Our gnocchi, which the waiter pushed heavily as a house favorite, had the very nice light and airy texture other reviewers had referenced but was bland. I did appreciate that it came already pre-split to share between myself and my partner. My meal (short rib) was decent, the risotto it came with was excellent, but it didn't stand out from other higher end Italian resturants I've been too. The Panna Cotta for desert however was very good. All in all, a very nice meal, better than average, but nothing to write home about.  The service was great. Our waiter was attentive and helpful and checked in on us often. This was the high point of the night. Low point, we were sitting on the outside patio and throughout dinner we were bothered by the smell of garbage from the alleyway as well as the shirtless man lounging on his balcony directly above us. While A Tavola can't be faulted for these things I did take away from our experience.

2011-06-30,3.0,"It rather pains me to have to drop two stars when my multiple previous visits were all worthy of five stars.  I went again last night because it is (was) one of my favorite restaurants and it had been quite a while since I had been. A good friend was taking me for a belated birthday dinner and since we both loved A Tavola, going back was an easy sell.  We didn't make a reservation, but since we arrived on the early side, we had no problem getting a table on their patio. It was a perfect evening to sit outside and enjoy a leisurely dinner.  We wanted to start with wine but the wine list on our table was empty, as in the book had no pages in it. After we were finally able to flag someone down, we were given the wine list and we decided on what we wanted to order. I ordered a rosé and my friend ordered something white that she couldn't pronounce (this will be important later).  Our wine arrives and we're asked about our food selections. We always share an order of gnocchi to start and I opted for the lamb special, medium rare, and my friend went with the fish of the day.  Our gnocchi arrives, already split, which I always appreciate, and while it was good, it just wasn't nearly as good as I remember. Our empty plates sat there until our dinner arrives...thirty minutes later. We were never offered second glasses of wine which we would have happily drunk. Our server simply plunked our plates down and scurried off.  My lamb was frightfully overcooked but since our server didn't come back to check on us (I never even saw her on the patio after that), I couldn't send it back so I just ate it because I feared it would be another half hour before a new dish was prepared and I didn't want my friend to eat alone. The other odd thing was that both of our entrees were to come with potatoes - that's potatoes, plural. What we each got was one sad little new potato (and I mean tiny), cut in half. Did potatoes suddenly get really expensive? Last time I checked, they were one of the more cheap starches (hell, I used to buy a bag of them in college and subsist on them for a week), so why so chintzy, A Tavola?  After we finished our entrees my friend decided she really wanted a second glass of wine but again, finding our server was next to impossible. When she finally came out, she had to ask my friend what she ordered. My friend said ""The wine I couldn't pronounce earlier."" The server said ""Oh, I'll figure it out"" and walked away.  The server must have passed by our table at least six times in the next ten minutes but never looked our way or delivered the wine. My friend got up to go to the bathroom and our server came to me and asked if she had ordered white wine. I said ""yes"" then she ran off again.  By now, my friend returned and still didn't have her wine. I would have ordered dessert to enjoy while my friend was drinking her wine but we were never asked and since the wine situation wasn't looking so promising, we decided to just find the server and tell her to cancel the wine so we could get out of there. Again, we couldn't find her so my friend got up to look for her and found her and told her to cancel the wine. The server remarked that it ""was on the table"" and my friend had to tell her that it wasn't and to just forget about it and bring our check as it was getting late.  The server then brings the wine, apologizes and tells us she won't charge us for the wine. Okay, great. Since we got the wine, I decide to order dessert so I can eat it while my friend has her wine. Again, it took our server several minutes to bring the dessert menu and take my order. I finally get my panna cotta and we eat and drink in a hurry as we've now been there 2.5 hours.  Another server brings our check and asks us if we want gratis limoncello shots to make up for the long wait. It was a nice gesture but we declined as we just wanted to leave. An apology was nice, but it was kind of too late at that point (and it would have been more appropriate if it came from our own server).  So all we wanted was a leisurely dinner, and by god, we got it. 2.5 hours later, we were out of there.  I'm hoping the bad service was just a fluke, because I really love A Tavola and prior to last night I'd had nothing but good experiences there, but it may be some time before I go back and give it another try.",0.9985,0.786,0.155,0.059,0.45324282199282206

A great place for a romantic dinner or with a few close friends. The service staff were incredibly helpful, extremely friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu. Now to the food.  We started out with the gnocchi with browned sage butter and parmesan which was very good. This was my first introduction to gnocchi and I found it to be very enjoyable. My main course was the leg of lamb special that they were offering, and I found the lamb to be succulent, cooked to order (medium rare) and paired with parmesan potatoes and garlic spinach which complimented the lamb very well. The portions were good for the entrees and slightly small for the appetizer. As for the dessert I shared the flour-less chocolate cake with ice cream. It was a wonderful way to end the meal.  In all it was a fantastic experience and definitely a place that I would go to again. I would definitely recommend going, although it is a pricey restaurant so be prepared for that.

What we had:  Apps-  Portabella and king oyster mushrooms: majority's favorite. AMAZING flavor. Risotto: I thought this was mouthwatering. However, our party was split on whether it tasted like chicken soup or greatness. Everyone liked it though because it's hard not to like risotto. Gnocchi: completely unique. Definitely worth it, just make sure to order the mushrooms, too. Mussels and clams: Good, but not memorable. Not very inventive or anything. Mains- Grouper special: Phenomenal. The outside was crispy and the inside was cooked perfectly. Great quality and flavor. The sides, potatoes and broccoli, came out looking plain, but were so incredibly tasty. Beef tenderloin: Again, cooked flawlessly. My boyfriend must have said ""this is just a great cut of meat"" three times.  Polenta side dish: Very unique - much lighter and airier than I'm used to with polenta (I'm usually not a polenta fan). Almost cakey. If all polenta tasted like this, I'd eat it more often. Dessert-  Panna cotta: I didn't think I liked panna cotta because of the texture, but this was awesome. Wow, we smiled the entire time eating this. Flourless chocolate cake: My parents ate this. My dad liked the panna cotta better, my mom disagreed.  Environment was nice and cozy, super nice. But I'd rather talk about the food.",0.9977,0.67,0.301,0.029,0.7062864120006977
2010-10-25,3.0,"After reading most of the reviews here and given a recommendation to A Tavala, i had high hopes and really wanted to enjoy it.  My review is 2.5 stars. My Wife and I had 6pm reservations on a Saturday night and we were seated promptly, only about half of the very small restaurant was occupied.  This place is very small, most tables have 4 chairs but it would be very tight to get 4 people at these tables comfortably.  It was very quiet, no soft music playing and actually brighter than i would of liked it, dimming the lights would of helped.   On to our meal: Our server was very good all night.  She was knowledgeable about the wine list and paired things well with the meal.  Overall service was very good and had no complaints there.   - To start, we ordered the gnocchi to share.  While it was tasteful, it did not live up to all the hype.  For $11 we each got 5 little gnocchi which as others have said were pillow soft.  Almost too soft to where the texture was mushy and felt raw.  Needless to say the flavor was good, but my Wife did not enjoy the raw texture.   - I ordered one of the specials which was a pork dish over a bed of beans.  The pork was fall off the bone fork tender, but the mixture of flavors were over powering the actual flavor of the meat.  I think it was the mint on top that over powered everything.   - My Wife ordered the beef tenderloin and was pleased with the beef and spinach.  It was about an 8oz piece of tenderloin with 3 thin potato slices and some spinach.  I tried the Beef and it did have good flavor but the overall value/price is what bothered us more.   The reason for our 2.5 stars comes down to value for the money.  we walked out of there with 1 appetizer, 2 entree's, and 3 total glasses of wine and it was $140 with tip.  Now let's think about this.  $140 could of gotten us a lot more food and value for the money in this city.  I'm still trying to find what the niche is about this place.  It's not overly romantic, the food is overpriced, and the atmosphere was pretty dry.",0.9926,0.811,0.145,0.044,0.5193348595848596

2010-10-19,5.0,"Would you like to score a few romantical points with your significant other?  A date at A Tavola will achieve the following:  1. Prove you to know your stuff...despite quite a few raves on this particular website, it's still a bit ""undiscovered."" Meaning, you are ORIGINAL. Always a good thing.  2. Shows that you have breadth and depth beyond the stapled neighborhoods of Lakeview, Lincoln Park, Wicker Park and Bucktown. (But it's not TOOOOOO far).  3. A goodnight kiss. (If that is what you so desire). Ok, I can't promise this one, but play your cards right, order the correct wine, languish over some finely cooked food...and well, the rest is up to you, mmmk? A TAVOLA! It's an upper scale Italian restaurant on Chicago avenue nearing Western. There is a sign that whispers...but does not scream. There is no valet (but street parking is very easy). There's just A Tavola, sitting there inhabiting a former home, with a sprawling (city standards) back patio.  It's a white-table-cloth-kind-of-place (and priced accordingly, for the most part). It's nice, but you won't feel under dressed in jeans and a jacket, or even just jeans and a button-up shirt. Girls, I'd leave the flip flops at home (but hey, I always think that). It's not a ""judgey"" place, but it is the kind of place you'll feel a bit proud to be at (and protective of), and thus...adorn accordingly.  Typically at fancy-ish type restaurants, the food is small and perhaps unintelligible from the menu. At A Tavola you get wonderful homecooked classics with a twist, all freshly prepared and created that very night. An ever-changing menu of classic (real) Italian fare with large tender cuts of meat (I had the pork loin), fresh salads, appetizers, and fish. Great for a family dinner, out-of-towners that want a real taste of that lustrous Chicago dining scene...but aren't ""foodies"" or interested in fusion, sushi, etc.  A special occasion date with salads, appetizer, bottle of wine (sangiovese), 2 entrees, dessert and a bit o' bourbon for my beau + tax/tip = $175.  It's not inexpensive, but it IS quality. Classy, but not gauche.The twinkly white lights and candles on the patio were icing on the (birthday dinner) cake.

2010-10-14,3.0,"a tavola isn't as bad as the rare few have rated it, and it's definitely not as fantastic as most people contend. Wednesday night was our first visit to the restaurant. It was about 7:30 and we were seated immediately as there were only two other tables occupied (there are a total or 10 tables, so on weekends, I can imagine wait times can be extensive). Our waiter was prompt, friendly, and very knowledgeable on the menu. Starting out with a glass of merlot, we ordered the portabella mushroom and caprese. The mushroom was fantastic--marinated and cooked perfectly. The caprese was caprese; there's nothing particularly original about a tavola's, be it quality or taste. Rather than order a full on entrée, we decided to try out the various pasta dishes, opting for the Bolognese, gnocchi, and risotto. The Bolognese would have been fine enough, except for the fact that it was covered in salt. My cousin had the same complaint when he was there earlier this week, but I wrote it off as an isolated incident... I was wrong. The gnocchi was all right, but not great. Quite honestly, it didn't really offer any special experience, in either taste or texture. Finally, the risotto was absolutely fantastic. The flavors were incredible--fresh spices blended with slices of tender chicken. At that point, we were both content, so there was no need for dessert. In the end, the location and ambience were very comfortable and cozy, the service was great, the wine menu is extensive and of stellar quality, and the food, while not bad, just wasn't particularly extraordinary on the whole.",-0.876,0.814,0.079,0.106,0.5959096459096458

For there are no glaring neon signs, no valet stand and none of the ""pomp and circumstance"" that is usually present in a restaurant of this caliber.  No. A Tavola is more like having dinner at a friend's house. A friend who grows their own lettuce for the arugula salad in the back yard. A friend who's fresh herb garden provides the added accent to many dishes. A friend who's mom must have come from the ""old country"" to be able to make food as good as this!  We started with a couple of their appetizers. The portabella and shittake mushroom special was amazing. Marinated and then freshly grilled- who knew mushrooms could taste this good! And the caprese salad? The buffalo mozzarella just melted in my mouth.  We then ordered two of the pasta dishes- the gnocchi (an extra large portion as my friend said he was going to take some home) and the pasta with the homemade bolognese sauce for me. Let me say right now- that there were no leftovers of either. Both were delicious!  As for entrees- my friend ordered the red grouper which was the special of the day (served with caper sauce) and I had the grilled lamb with fresh spinach. These, too, were perfectly prepared and still were ""praise worthy"" the next day when I had them for leftovers.  Finally ,we split the panna cotta. This rich dessert drizzled with vanilla sauce had a firm, fresh texture that made for the perfect ending to our meal.  Service was outstanding. There were no missed steps and our server's recommendations were spot on. She knew her stuff.  On the night we were there- there was a private party in the main dining area so we were seated upstairs. Upstairs lacks the ambiance but the food is just as good.

2010-08-01,4.0,"Yep, this place is super awesome just like everyone says.  Plenty of gushing already in this Yelp thread, so instead here are just a few tips for when you go there (which you must):  1) Go when it's warm enough to sit on the patio out by the herb garden.  2)  The place isn't nearly as dressy or intimidatingly expensive as I had been previous led to believe (disclaimer:  I wasn't the one who picked up the check [Thanks, Chad!] but I did see the menu prices and they really weren't that bad.  3)  DO NOT skip the gnocchi, but more importantly, DO NOT skip eating the crispy sage leaves that come with it.  Seriously, one of the most surprisingly delicious things I have ever noshed.  4)  Both the daily specials and the regular menu were equally tasty.  Note:  The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that my lamb, while delicious and well prepared, didn't completely blow my mind.  However, to be fair, the last couple times I had lamb anywhere I didn't think it was that great so maybe I just don't really like lamb anymore.  However, my friend's pork shank and my other friend's beef tenderloin were top notch.  5)  Get something with spinach...normally I only like raw spinach but this was cooked absolutely perfectly.  6)  The best dessert was the flour-less chocolate cake and I don't even normally like flour-less chocolate cake.  But it was rich and light and moist, kind of like a fresh-from-the-oven brownie.  Um, yes please!",0.9978,0.706,0.278,0.016,0.547051282051282
2010-07-30,5.0,"Absolutely amazing. Atmosphere. Service. Style. Presentation. Flavor. I accomplished two major feats this week. One - I introduced 4 native Chicagoans to a tavola - in a city of fine restaurants none of them had heard of a tavola until I recommended we dine there based upon the recommendations of my fellow yelpers. Which brings me to Two - by now we should have four new yelpers! What an amazing experience. For starters, we felt like we were entering the restauranteur's home, as the restaurant is a refurbished row house. Upon entering, we received a warm welcome and were escorted to our corner table. From there, the fine service began. Everybody was completely attentive to our needs. The menu is limited on purpose, and for good reason. Many items are grown fresh in the backyard garden, and the pasta is made on site. So where to begin? A fresh spinach salad? Salad calabrese? (I had the Calabrese - completely fresh and totally delicious). Second course is a pasta. At the recommendation of many fellow yelpers, we had the gnocchi - and the yelpers were right. Best gnocchi any of us have ever tasted. I also ordered pasta tagliatelle bolognese. We passed it around the table, and all agreed that a tavola bolognese was the best we had experienced. On to main course. I had the filet, medium rare. Seasoned with olive oil and sea salt and cooked over wood it was outstanding. It was accompanied by sauteed spinach with garlic and roasted rosemarypotatoes. A lightly breaded grouper filet was also offered off menu, and three of my companions enjoyed this wonderful dish. The dessert selection included four items, all prepared fresh in-house. Of course, we tried all four accompanied by either cappucino or port (guess which I chose) and the meal concluded with smiles all around. A tavola is definitely worth a visit. I know that when I return to Chicago I will look forward to a return visit.",0.9961,0.797,0.197,0.005,0.5716078192640694

Imagine my surprise when a client from Dallas, Tx made this recommendation based on his Yelp search. I am so glad he found this gem. I had no idea such a place existed in the Ukraine Village. Every dish we has was incredible. From appetizers to deserts, every mouthful was a delight. The rosemary bread was the first surprise, fresh baked taste and a wonderful seasoned crust. My appetizer was the cured meat dish of capicole, prosciutto and thin sliced sausage, not sure what the name was but delicious. We shared the gnocchi, and oh my, it was indescribable. Like no other gnocchi I have ever had, these were the lightest, most flavorful morsels I ever had in my life. The marinated, grilled portobello mushrooms were unbelievable. For my entree', I had the grilled lamb that was cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth tender. Desert was the perfect compliment to our melange of immensely flavored food. We order and shared four of the deserts, one better than the next, but the I think it was a draw between the panna cotta and the lemon tart.  What a great dining experience.

The panna cotta, like the gnocchis, is unlike any other - those dishes could be my final meal on this Earth!

The calamari fritti is exceptional (the deep friend lemon was delicious too!) and everyone enjoyed it. I had the pork special and the meat fell off the bone, literally. My friends loved their dishes (tagliatelle bolognese, beef short ribs, lamb special) and our waitress Maggie was great. The only this that I thought fell short was dessert. My husband and I were not as impressed with them as our friends were so I can't say they were bad, just not amazing (like the pork).  Here's why I didn't give them 5 stars: I wasn't in the mood for a meat dish but there was very little without meat on the menu so I ended up with the pork. I would have preferred a nice meatless pasta dish but the only option was gnocchi in browned butter and sage, a dish I ate a lot of this winter. I'm sure it was nice, just not what I was looking for. Also,  I may be neurotic (abnormal?) about this, but I don't like a lot of salt in my dishes and the soup was a touch too salty for my taste, the same soup that was essentially the bed for my pork.

Thirdly: If you're concerned about what to wear, don't be. You can wear jeans and a nice shirt which goes for both men and women, I mean heck, the guy at the table next to me was wearing a sweatshirt!  The food and the service is PHENOMENAL! They have this cuddlefish calamari as an appetizer that you should definitely try because it is delicious! And also make sure to get the gnocchi because it is light and really good!

We started with the cuddlefish/calamari appetizer, fantastic!  I had never heard of cuddlefish, but I am a huge fan. Its a lot less chewy than calamari. It was breaded to perfection. For our entrees, I went with the fish special, the grouper, which was breaded lightly and in a deliciously light lemon sauce, served with potatoes and broccoli. It was very good, but really nothing compared to what my fiance got, the short ribs with the risotto.  The cheesy, creamy risotto was my favorite thing of the night, absolutely amazing.  I rarely eat red meat, but those short ribs were outstanding, I will definitely be ordering that next time I go back.  I didnt try the gnocchi like everyone recommended, but I will definitely on our next visit.

Thus, the couple that arrived after us was seated first and the couple that was at the bar was seated last! When the head waiter asked if she was ""sure"" that this was the correct order she INSISTED it was. Uh, no.

The things I liked: - The waiter let us try a bunch of wines by the glass until we found the perfect one for us. - The cuttlefish appetizer with fried lemons.  Really flavorful and interesting.  A nice upgrade to regular ole fried calamari.   - The mussels and clams.  The mussels were huge, plump, and juicy!  Clams were good.  I have had that broth 100 times at other restaurants...nothing special, did not want to sop it up with the bread (see bread review below!) - The tagliatelle bolognese!  So amazing.  Fresh, delicious pasta with a delicate meat sauce.  I could eat 10 plates of this!   - The size of the restaurant...felt like you were in a little house at someone's dinner party! Things I didn't love: - A curtain blocking the entrance.  A curtain just doesn't cut it in the dead of a Chicago winter! - The foccacia.  Cold, cold, cold.  Foccacia should be warm and soft.  I loved the olives and olive oil accompanying the bread, but the bread was EH. - Maybe it was all the hype, but I thought the gnocchi was GOOD.  Not amazing, not the best I have ever had.  And how many times can you have gnocchi with sage?  It's overdone.  Maybe I would have loved it with a delicious homemade marinara or vodka sauce.  The actual gnocchi did melt in my mouth.  Just didn't love the prep. - The pork.  I am not saying that we didn't eat every bite, but it was not my favorite.  It felt like we were eating dark meat turkey, not flavorful, juicy pork.  It was just okay. - Service was good, not great.  A little slow and a little unauthentic.  I would say that it was more good than bad though.   So there was nothing about the night that was bad per se - we had a wonderful night and I love just having a chill night with my BF with red wine and good food.  And it was funny to listen to the horrible conversation going on next to us - unnecessary and inappropriate petting included. I would go here if you are in the area, but there are definitely other places I want to try before coming back here for seconds.",0.9975,0.661,0.24,0.099,0.6204647811205191

But my fears were quickly relieved when the apps arrived.  The fresh fig and buffalo mozzarella was superb.  Really nice dish.  The cuttlefish calamari was a nice twist on the more traditional calamari.  The cuttlefish was more mature and had a nice strong flavour.  The breading was the right crispiness and the fried lemon slices were a nice touch.   The gnocchi were wonderfully soft pillows presented in a brown sage butter with fried sage leaves.  The gnocchi themselves had been dipped in a bit of parmesan before being finished off, which provided a slight hint of a crust on one part.  Very nice texture contrasts and great flavours.   The tagliatelle bolognese was cooked to the perfect al dente.  The sauce was packed with flavour but not overpowering.  A nicely balanced dish.   The grilled marinated leg of lamb was phenomenal.  After marination the lamb was grilled off and got a nice crust.  It was then presented sliced along with garlic spinach and rosemary potatoes.  This was my favourite dish of the night.  I'm a sucker for lamb, and this was prepared perfectly.  I requested it rare, and they provided it perfectly rare.  It was incredibly tender, and had a nice crust around the edges.  Beautiful!  The garlic spinach was cooked very lightly so that it was still bordering on almost undercooked - but it worked well.  The potatoes had been encrusted with a bit of parmesan and were lovely.   Overall a wonderful first meal!",0.9957,0.752,0.205,0.042,0.7011746031746031

2009-02-20,4.0,"My fiancee is a huge fan of gnocchi... and because of this, I decided that this Valentines Day, we would make our way to find the best gnocchi in the city of Chicago as a treat! I did my research on the foodie forums as well as yelp, and found that A Tavola was consistently ranked one of the best places to enjoy gnocchi...and with three weeks before Valentine's Day, I called ahead to make a reservation... for the only spot they had left... at 10:00 PM.  That's how crazy it was on Valentine's Day here. People aren't kidding when they say that this place is a converted apartment into a restaurant.  It is absolutely that.  Wired with some speakers playing some smooth jazz and some dimmed overhead lights with candlelights on the table, it was a comfortable atmosphere... and unfortunately at 10:00 PM after a full day of running around, my fiancee and I were growing tired by the minute. Not being heavy eaters, we ordered an appetizer to split, a pasta to split, and then two main courses.  This consisted of the special of the day (Mussels and Clams), the Gnocchi in Brown Butter and Sage, the short rib, and the beef tenderloin. Mussels and Clams:  Neither my fiancee or I have ever tasted such tender, flavorful mussles in our lives... I didn't even know mussels could be cooked to such perfection!  I'll be honest, this was the highlight of the meal... while each of us only received three bites of mussel and two bites of clam, this appetizer will stay etched in our memories forever...  This may be a rotating special, so absolutely order it if you have the opportunity! Gnocchi:  This was delicious... and memorable, but unfortunately, my fiancee is not a fan of the brown butter/sage sauce.  While each of us only received five pieces of gnocchi, I can honestly say I don't think I would be able to eat more due to the richness of the sauce.  The gnocchi on it's own was light and airy, and had a perfect texture.  No chewiness at all (far different from my experiment at home).  Delicious second dish. Tenderloin:  Tasty seasoning, but not equivalent to the steak you find at a good steak house.  Nothing wrong with this tenderloin by any means, but compared to the finer steak houses in the city, it just didn't match up.  This came with sauteed spinach and some roasted potatoes which were above average, but nothing phenomenal. Short rib:  A VERY fatty piece of meat.... which was surprising, as I would think they'd use a leaner cut.  Tasty, and good flavoring, but again nothing spectacular.  Came with a saffron risotto that was good, however my personal preference is a creamier risotto overall.  Fiancee is not a fan of saffron we found out this night. Both my fiancee and I enjoyed the food, however whole heartedly agreed that the appetizer and pasta were miles above the main course.  Would I go back?  Quite possibly... while the appetizer and pastas would likely have us going back, the main course would definitely need a change of pace. They have a fantastic deal on Mondays where you can sign up to learn to cook with the chef, and enjoy a meal with all those that were signed up afterwards for practically the same price of the meal... in fact, I think it's actually cheaper than the meal itself.  It would be a great experience, I believe, for foodies and those interested in learning how to prepare some of these dishes... I plan to call ahead and find out if they'll teach those appetizers and the gnocchi specifically before signing up.",0.9974,0.815,0.15,0.035,0.5858508403361345

We asked the waiter for wine suggestions and he provided a delicious bottle that fit into my budget. The entrees came out, but we had still not received the gnocchi. We let our server know and he said that the kitchen must have skipped a course on us. No big deal to us- we were thrilled with our meats. It is some of the best lamb I have ever had and the roasted chicken was delicious! The rosemary potatoes were nothing special and the polenta (I did not taste) looked to be rather plain.

This was the best Italian meal that we have had outside of Italy (although Anteprima is a very close second).  The short rib with saffron risotto and gremolata was fabulous.  My husband's special - braised pork shank over cannellini beans - was just as good.  The pastas were outstanding, as were desserts (although Anteprima's panna cotta wins by a hair). Service was a little awkward, but I think that was more due to the fact that we weren't paying (though we did tip our server), and neither we nor our server quite knew how to handle the end of the meal.

Each one is a pillowy bite of deliciousness. If I'm ever on death row, I will be ordering the gnocchi here as part of my last meal!  I brought my boy here in March for his birthday dinner, and it was a hit with both of us. It's a cozy little place with fantastic food and excellent service. We were warmly greeted and seated immediately for our reservation. Our server was friendly and helpful with recommendations, not pretentious at all. The crowd was mostly couples, of all ages, and a few larger groups. It's not a big dining room, but the tables are well-spaced and it's a very comfortable setting.  I started with the grilled/marinated/roasted veggie appetizer, which was basic but very good. Then on to the aforementioned gnocchi fabulousness, which the boy and I split. I had beef for my entree (I think it was filet mignon, but it could've been tenderloin - sorry, it was awhile ago). I do remember it being tender and delicious. We also had a bottle of Spanish wine which was very tasty.  You may have an issue with the restroom here if you have a shy bladder since it's right off the dining room, and it's not exactly sound proof. It's a very clean, nice restroom, though, and I had no problem with it.

I highly recommend the pasta dishes, especially the gnocchi.  I believe they make their own pasta, which is probably why they are so good.  As previous reviewers have mentioned, the pasta dishes are pretty small, not enough to constitute a meal by themselves (unless you order a couple).  The entrees, on the other hand, are HUGE.  Though the place is a bit small, it's a good restaurant to bring a group, since good food makes for good conversation!",0.9845,0.77,0.212,0.018,0.6039569160997732

Ok, enough excusing myself...onto the review. Service was wonderful. I really enjoy when you get a server who is a professional and our guy was.  Layout of the inside was cute, the outside patio where we ate was as well, creating a great date spot. Location=great for me....probably not as great for others. I was commenting if this place was moved to LP, everyone would know about it (and it would also probably get ruined.) Food: The menu itself is pretty bare (4 courses, about 3 choices each...mains are nothing to write home about)...The key is the specials. App: Split the figs with mozz...large portion...was good, fresh, but not what I was expecting. I asked if the mozz was Burrata and explained it as the kind with the creamy center and he said yes...it was not (side note: if you see burrata flown in fresh from Italy absolutely try it.) Pasta: Gnocchi, as everyone commented it was like eating pillows blah blah...its good...also got the pasta with the lamb? ragu...was also great, but unnecessary...the pastas are very small (gnocchi esp) Mains: Date ordered red snapper which was the fresh fish, and is apparently made the same way (lemon and capers), b/c  she wanted something lighter...It was lighter, but overcooked and pretty bland, although a good piece of fish. Also, served with friggin huge head of broccoli...this dish was definitely subpar.... I ordered the short rib (of course :)) and it was amazing....highlight of the night...the risotto accompanying it was fantastic and it was a huge portion. No dessert...I don't think that is their strong point. Overall, with wine it was around 140 with tip for two, which I didn't feel was worth the meal we got. If I were to go back I think the two pastas were unnecessary and you could easily just split an app or pasta and get an entree and be satisfied. Wine list had cheaper options (all italian wines.)

2007-11-07,5.0,"I'm almost afraid to review A Tavola because I don't want everyone going there!  I've been to most of the top restaurants in Chicago and A Tavola ranks among the very best.  The atmosphere, food and service are all tremendous.  On a recent visit I had their famous gnocchi with a side of rosemary potatos.  Both dishes were absolutely perfect.  My server recommended a glass of red wine that perfectly complemented my meal.  As much as I enjoyed their menu fare, the bread they serve to start you off was incredible!  If I could have nothing more than that bread and a nice glass of wine, I'd still leave very happy.  I also want to point out how nice the room is.  The restaurant looks like it may have once been a residence.  And that's what it feels like, being in someones home.  A Tavola is a great restaurant for any grown-up occasion, particularly a romantic date.  I've already made plans to go back this weekend!",0.9911,0.746,0.234,0.02,0.6784210526315789

2007-08-30,5.0,"a tavola is so intimate and perfectly about the food, i am liable to weep at the sheer emotion and joy of it all.  while this review is a little dated (the meal was had in april of 2006) i must say a tavola provided the best meal i have ever ever had (but then again, i eat cheap grub and not often do i go to pricier joints). the service was attentive, friendly, personal but not overly involved. the setting was intimate with fresh white linens and minimalist taupe walls and black and white photos as a gallery-like decor.  we opened with four appetizers for five people, which included thinly-sliced dried cured ham with cheese, light salad with fresh greens and vinagrette, grilled vegetables, and grilled portobello. the ingredients didn't sound exotic or surprising but the ingredients themselves and the judiciousness of the seasoning were impeccable. exceedingly fresh. we had two pastas as the first course (to share). the gnocchi was forgetful (cinnamon and nutmeg spiced). the lamb ragout parpadelle was SO. GOOD.  My dish was the braised beef short ribs on a bed of saffron risotto. it was beautifully cooked, meat just falling apart. it was definitely done right. perfectly seasoned with the gelatin evenly distributed throughout the meat, giving just the perfect mouthfeel. yum. i finished every luscious bite. one of my dining buddies had the braised pork shank over a bed of cannellini beans and topped with a wasabi slaw. again, the braising was simply perfect with the pork just perfectly tender, moist and gelatinous. the portion was large with the bones still in. look at this lovely beast. to finish, the panna cotta was the best of the desserts that we had during our chicago trip (business trip that is). luscious with a light caramel sauce, the white creamy confection was perfect.",0.9977,0.755,0.226,0.019,0.5568524970963995

He went to culinary school in California, opened this delicious and intimate restaurant in what used to be a sagebrush neighborhood for foodies, which flourished, has a private pilot's license that he uses to fly to his farm in Michigan, and seems surprisingly relaxed despite his jet set creds. The food is awesome: gnocchi, risotto, salads, mushrooms, salty, herby and moist chicken... go on a date and definitely order the gnocchi. Go home and fantasize about the food awhile. Then later celebrate monogamy by attending cooking class at A Tavola and learning how to make its recipes together, and hearing Dan's sage advice on how long to cook the chicken: ""'Til it's done"".

2007-08-26,5.0,"Wow, wow, wow.  I loved my night at A Tavola.  We started out with a nice half bottle of prosecco, fried calamari (done in true italian style, crispy but without the thick layer of breading that is common here), and figs and prosciutto... yum.  We had to get the famous gnocchi which I believe was served in brown butter with pieces of crisp fried sage and it IS worth all the hype and its absolutely delicious.  Other diners at my table had risotto... can't remember what kind, maybe chicken? and tagliatelle with homemade bolognese.  Delish.  We ordered fish and steaks for our mains -- simply but perfectly seasoned, and cooked to perfection.  Dessert was amazing as well.  Our waiter was great -- attentive but left us alone to enjoy our meal when appropriate.  Wine and espresso was great too.  I will DEFINITELY be back and will definitely recommend this as a date or double-date type of place.",0.9961,0.644,0.325,0.03,0.597874149659864

2007-06-08,5.0,"Lovely lovely lovely place.  A Tavola is tucked away in a discreet house along Chicago avenue; everyone keeps saying it's like walking into someone's house, and I'd totally agree.   I can't think of any other Italian restaurant in Chicago that is like this place.  Many good Italian places in Chicago seem to give you the mobster-in-kitchen-cooking feeling, or they are massive corporate places.  This place is tiny yet very, very classy and quite a fine dining experience.  You could get away with casual dress but most people dressed up for their night out. The service was outstanding.  Personal, not stuffy, friendly, top notch.  Food was delicious.  Their menu is very succinct, with several specials in addition. I ordered calamari that was on special, and short-rib dish that was on special.  The calamari was wonderfully cooked, no sauce given or needed.  The short-ribs were good, served on a saffron risotto that was also tasty.  The menu is set up to have a 3 course (4 with dessert) meal, but we opted to share the pasta course between our table.  We had the Gnocchi, which is what they're known for... It was marvelous.   Though I think a whole plate of it would've been too much for me.  For dessert I had a flourless chocolate cake, which was good (very brownie-like).   Dinner for 3 was about $200 with 2 drinks each and dessert.  Everything I've read elsewhere highly recommends reservations since the dining room is so small.  They also have a patio out back.",0.9944,0.75,0.221,0.029,0.5285578231292517

2007-05-04,4.0,"We went to A Tavola for a cooking class last summer.   If you have never gone to a cooking class and want to try one I highly recommend going to the A Tavola class.  The recipes that we prepared that night were an herb, lemon and salt (2 handfuls of sea salt!) stuffed chicken, delicious balsamic & herb marinated portabellas, fresh gnocci with brown sage butter & apple tart tatin.   The class was small - only 6 people - so we were able to get some real hands on time on the kitchen.  After cooking everyone went downstairs to the main dining room and got to eat what we made (along with a few other dishes from the main kitchen). The owner sat and ate with us.   It's a little strange eating a family style meal with people you really don't know and trying to make small talk...but it worked since we spent most of the time talking about the food, other recipes and the chef. I'd give the whole experience 5 stars, except that when I tried to recreate the meal exactly as on the recipe card I ran into some major problems.  I decided to surprise my husband one night by recreating the meal we learned in class... The 500 degree oven heat required for the chicken turned every smoke alarm on in my house.  Apparently the fat rendered from the chicken decided to splatter all over the oven and burn, causing 2 stories of our house to be filled with smoke.   It's not fun being 8 months pregnant on a ladder trying to take the batteries out of your smoke alarm.  I don't think I'll be trying the chicken recipe again.  I do make the portabellas and tart tatin regularly and they are amazing!  I think the chef rotates the menu for the cooking classes - and I think you can even request a special meal cooking class.",0.858,0.896,0.067,0.037,0.49232378732378723

I was happily reminded that when dining out- ambiance is not always what makes a place.  For the food here is exceptional. Once the food started arriving, I would have cared less if there were Coors Light posters on the wall (well maybe). Everyone was delighted with their food- and amongst those I dined with- that's a miracle.  The place is very small, as stated in other posts, and is masterfully managed by one waiter! Considering the quality of the food and wines available- I was truely impressed with the waiters ability to give us due attention- and handle every other table- seemingly the same way.  If you search this place out- be sure to make reservations- due to it's size (or lack thereof) and be advised that you can drive right past it and not see it.  Over all, I'd say if someone wanted to have a REALLY good meal, A Tavola would definately be on the list.",0.9751,0.831,0.146,0.023,0.5676984126984127

2006-08-12,5.0,"I was happy to see one other review for this restaurant, and actually thought I might be the first -- most people are not aware of this amazing little restaurant. I don't think they have any more than 10 tables in this street-side restaurant, that is obviously a converted duplex. You feel like you're walking into someone's home, and the good thing is: they treat you like you are in their home. Incredibly quiet, peaceful, romantic and dark, this was a great restaurant to celebrate a special occasion. I had just gotten back to Chicago following a long and hard trial on the East Coast. 20 hour days for two weeks straight, and my brain and body were mush. This was exactly the kind of chilled-out dinner for which my wife and I were looking. The dishes were very personal: it felt like someone was cooking this entree with you in mind, meaning it wasn't just cooked and thrown up on a hot plate. The menu is very limited, but portioned per course beautifully, and there is a staple item for even the pickiest eater. We had some incredible grilled vegetables, amazing pastas, and a delicious trio of veal medallions. We haven't done this yet, but apparently there is a cooking class that Chef Bocik (who also greeted us at the door -- a fun personal touch), teaches, and it runs an eye-poppingly reasonable $50/pp including the actual meal you enjoy along with the class. Pop over to West Chicago Ave. to A Tavola next time you're looking for a good date night, and a change of pace from the hustle and bustle.",0.9947,0.793,0.197,0.009,0.48924297924297944

The menu is pretty limited, with only a handful of appetizer and entree choices, but the ones they offered were pretty appealing. They also offer pastas, which are more of a second course, so it is larger than an appetizer but smaller than an entree.  I opted for a pasta dish, gnocchi with brown sage butter and parmesan cheese, with a side of rosemary potatoes. The gnocchi was fabulous! Very light and flavorful, with crisp sage leaves. The rosemary potatoes were also very good with parmesan cheese crusted on top.  This restaurant is a very cute find. It is a little out of the way from other things, but it is well worth the trip out there.",0.9786,0.808,0.183,0.01,0.603922305764411
