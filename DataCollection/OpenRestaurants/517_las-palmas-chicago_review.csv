2017-07-29,4.0,"This place deserves five stars, but I'm giving it four stars because of the 15 min wait we had before someone finally noticed us and came to take our order.. I came here last night for dinner around 9pm and it wasn't too busy. We were greeted kindly and seated right away in the sun room. The decor makes you feel like you're in Mexico or somewhere in South America. It has a very cozy feel to it.  I ordered the Mar Y Tierra which came with a super juicy filet, shrimp, carrots/spinach and mashed squash which was very interesting! To me, it tasted strong on its own, but when you eat it with a bite of the fillet, everything blends so well together. My boyfriend ordered the Asada, i believe that's what it was called. I don't see it on their website.. It was a skirt steak on tomatoes topped with goat cheese and chimichurri. Not a fan of goat cheese, but according to him, it was amazing (: And for dessert we shared Tres Leches, which isnt on their website either. The cake was so spongy and full of flavor. It was topped with fresh strawberries and hibiscus syrup. My mouth waters as I'm typing this. haha  Overall, amazing experiencing and already looking forward to going back!

2017-07-19,4.0,"The prices are reasonable and the food is on point.  I had the Mar y Tierra(Surf & Turf) which consisted of a filet, which I usually don't enjoy because they are usually too lean and not enough flavor.  The filet had just the right amount of marbling to make it very flavorful.  It also had a touch of char but not overcooked.   For the Surf, included pan seared tiger shrimp, which were tender, sweet and flavorful.  My wife had a an appetizer as a meal, the Calabacita which is pumpkin stuffed with shrimp, mushrooms, scallops and spaghetti squash covered in a white wine cream sauce. That was also surprising satisfying.  I believe we visited on a Tuesday evening.  I thought the service could have been better, seeing that restaurant was very slow.  Overall a good experience and I would recommend it.",0.969,0.834,0.153,0.013,0.46112244897959176

Service was always good the two times I've come. Ample seating in the front, middle (glasses in area), and outdoor patio (so cute at night).  Food wise, it's a little fancy. won't get your simple tacos..they are all in meals and small in portion, the fajitas were disappointing, the amount of beans and rice just didn't cut the price after a sunday funday and i needed some substantial base of food to carry on the night.

2017-05-01,5.0,"I am reposting this Review because i can no longer find it! After dining at Las Palmas on North Ave in Chicago we felt compelled to leave a review.            My wife and I, are always searching for a great place to dine. Although we make it a point to experience somewhere different each time, it's always nice to have a favorite especially when it's local. In all the 15 years living in Chicago we constantly struggled to find the whole package, great food, great service and always a warm welcome. Then there it was, a quaint little restaurant with murals on their outside walls, strutting the Art of local talent located in the heart of the Wicker Park.      What was truly remarkable was the fact that this restaurant has been around for quite some time, and it was located only 4 blocks from our house. Tough to believe that the restaurant that was right under our noses would be the answer to all our aspirations, becoming our favorite place to dine. Our only disappointment was not discovering this restaurant sooner. I can only depict with little certainty that I will be able to give proper merit to this establishment that undeniably deserves.Here, a meek attempt at best to sum up what I experienced and what anyone can expect        To start off the evening, although the restaurant was busy as we entered, a most gracious host with a charismatic smile cordially greeted us, wasting no time leading us to a quaint little table to sit. The hostess made friendly gestures at my three year old as she welcomed us, getting the evening off to a good start. Shortly there-after the owner of what seemed to be a family owned business, personally took time out of his busy agenda to greet us, offering us an array of tropical drinks to get us started, one of which was the special of the house called ""The Coconut Mojito"", which was nothing short of delicious!         Having tried many Mexican restaurants, we thought we had an idea of what to expect since none of them manufactured their own original or unique tastes. Boy were we in for a ride.       Well as you can probably predict, we didn't have to wait long after our drinks were served, to promptly place our order. Unaware of what we were about to feast upon, we picked out 2 starters.The Empanada, (cornmeal turnovers stuffed with fresh shrimp and crab with an accompaniment of a variety of cheeses gently placed on a plate with a tangy sauce) and Costillas (oven roasted pork ribs served in a tamarindo salsa garnished with mango),  the most memorable thought as the meat fell right off the bone.         It was now time to pick a main, which in my opinion only spiked my curiosity of what to expect. Since we were still raving about the starters, l expected nothing less than truly superb going forward. As we waited my wife ordered some guacamole of which I was never a fan, but when my wife asked me to taste it, my thoughts were non-hesitant since everything so far was fantastic.  I am now a big fan.         Now, for the entrées. My wife ordered Mar Y Tierra (a 4 oz fillet mignon tender as butter, grilled to perfection served with pan-seared shrimp, alongside was sweet potatoes and sautéed baby spinach).  I ordered La Casa Borracha -(a pineapple and tequila soaked skirt steak on a stack of rum-cured plantains),  a taste like nothing to be found anywhere in the City, which was  consistent to the appetizers. In my wife's own words ""FABULOUS"" Every dish was prepared and served to perfection.My kudos to the Chef!        The whole meal was incomparably delicious, and impeccably timed, while the service was equally amazing, completely professional, and yet warmly welcoming. Can't say we didn't expect that, since great food usually goes hand in hand with great service. The waitress Jenna was splendid and delightful. Just when we thought we couldn't eat anymore, it was still hard to resist as we were presented with a fascinating selection of desserts. We were advised to try a salted caramel ice-cream with whipped sour cream on top some very fruity crumbled pistachios with a salted caramel taco shell. DELICIOUS and exquisitely unique to say the least!!!  Keep in mind we are tough critics being from the Capital of Great food,New York.    More importantly, given the quality of food and service at Las Palmas, the whole dinner was at the very least modestly priced.  Las Palmas now holds our favorite spot for great food with the ambiance it bestows, engenders a warm and inviting atmosphere sought after by so many looking for a pleasant dining experience when out with the family or on a romantic date. The most significant part of a great dining experience you may expect at Las Palmas is every bit from soup to nuts and from entry to exit. They hold the secret to what every restaurant strives for "" True achievement in every aspect of the industry""   Summation: The food & service varied from great to exceptional. This food was in all our Opinions immensely  flavorful & brilliantly creative! M. Denigris",0.9995,0.766,0.2,0.034,0.6341393621668853
2017-05-01,4.0,"First time at Las Palmas. Since Mixteco closed I was looking for a replacement-a place with not just rice and beans, tacos or burritos. Recommended by a friend. Cute little place, food was great-duck, pork and beef equally. Margaritas were potent and guacamole was freshly made a few feet away from our table. Nice music and atmosphere. The only minus-and this lingers in every review-is the customer service. One waiter for the whole restaurant on a Friday night. We felt a bit rushed when he was at the table and ignored when he wasn't. Definitely room for improvement. It wont stop me from going back!",0.8866,0.816,0.143,0.041,0.47564102564102567

The service is always good, the food always delicious. And the best part - you never have to wait!! Seating is always immediate. They have a green house room in the back that always lets in so much sunlight which is nice to sit in when it's cold af outside.  I always get the chilaquiles without meat and a fried egg. It comes out a little soggy but the sauce is so good I don't care. I branched out this time and got the veggie fajitas, and I'm so glad I did. If you're vegetarian I recommend those two dishes.  Also ask for the spicy sauce on the side, it's actually ridiculously spicy and always leaves me sweating.  I've also been for dinner on a Friday night and I didn't enjoy it as much - it was crowded and their dinner menu is much more expensive.",0.949,0.784,0.16,0.055,0.6108695652173912

I have now been trying to get ahold of the manager Maria for about a month. I leave messages with the only helpful person who always answers the phone. He provided me with helpful information but still recommended that I talk to the person in charge for more accurate info.  I was able to talk to Maria once and at that she seemed to rush the conversation. Told me she was updating packages and prices and would e-mail them to me. Thought about calling once more today but I give up. I have been working in the restaurant business over 10 years and I understand busy days and setting up events can be overwhelming. My event would be something smaller with close friends and family. Las Palmas seemed to be the best choice. Wish customer service could improve.,0.9791,0.831,0.162,0.006,0.5553030303030302

2016-12-30,2.0,"I'm giving this restaurant a 2 star review because the food was delicious but the service was atrocious. I was with a small group (4people) we waited easily 15 minutes before our drink orders were taken, another 10 for our drinks to make it to the table. We ordered Guacamole and salsa which were really good but no refills on chips or drinks were made while we ate the appetizer. Our food arrived about 25 minutes after we ordered (reasonable timing), but we had no silverware at our table. We asked the server who brought the food for silverware and he brought two forks and a knife which obviously left three people at our table with no utensils or with just a fork.  One of our guests had to get up to ask a second server and he brought everyone a silverware setting.  I had asked the server who dropped off the food for a refill. My acknowledged my request but forgot to bring my refill.  So again, had to ask another server for a refill. Once we had our food no one came back until we were done. Forget about refills or if you needed extra napkins or sauce, etc. luckily we didn't but this was still obnoxious.  It might sound like I'm complaining to complain since the food was good - I get it. But there is an expectation that when you go out to eat you'll have silverware at the table when your hot food comes out and when your drink is empty it will be replenished so you can enjoy your meal with a drink.  I'm not high maintenance and have rather low expectations of service since I used to wait tables but this experience just got under my skin.",0.176,0.819,0.088,0.092,0.5031481481481481

2016-12-25,5.0,"Went here for dinner. They were very courteous with reservations, calling about 1-2 hours before reservation time, to be sure the reservation was being kept. We sat towards the front.. I'm sure I would have liked to see the back dining area. but towards the front, it seems a little more casual, with white tiled floors. It was nice that there was a fireplace, for ambience.  Drinks: Fresh ingredients, and their spices add more of a flavorful kick, rather than be on the stupid hot side. I think I ordered the pepino, which features cucumber. I asked them to make it sweeter, which they happily obliged. I also ordered a drink with vanilla and pineapple, I believe? also really good. Sweeter, did not require extra simple syrup.  The bartender does know his drinks, knows his product, and the waiter did a great job selling/relaying the drinks, based on preference. We opted to share all food. Definitely a plus, since entrees and even the calabacita was easily shareable for two. Appetizers:  Guac: fresh and made to order. We got medium, and it was perfect. More on the mild side, which I definitely don't mind.   Complimentary salsa; also good. the red kind, and can even be paired with the guac on your chips. YUM! Ceviche: I'm not too big on fish-type ceviche, but this was good. refreshing and flavorful. Entrée Although it's technically an appetizer, I got the la calabcita. It features scrimp and scallop on a small pumpkin (think calabasa squash style).  Omg this blew my mind. Perfect combo of sweet and savory (maybe a hair on the salty side for me), but this was crack. It definitely helped, having the ceviche and chips and salsa or guac on board to help cut the salty/creaminess of the dish.  But honestly, I would order this again and again and again every time coming here. I'm salivating, remembering how great this dish was. I love my seafood, and this was perfect. I'd honestly almost want to just order this and double the portion, add some rice and plantains, and this would happily make my meal.  La casa borracha: omg this did not disappoint. the waiter told us that this menu has changed many times, but this is the one favorite that's kept its #1 spot on the list. We shared it, and it was easily divided for an even split. haha a good thing, too! this was soooo delicious. the skirt steak was cooked to preference (we chose medium). then with a potato, and with some plantains. Mmm this was yummy. every thing about it was good. Nice and savory for any guy, with the pretty presentation to please any girl.  my only slight flaw, was that the menu online didn't accurately reflect the menu in the restaurant. Some dishes were on the online menu, but not in the restaurants, and vice versa. However, it made me pleasantly surprised because I was able to try the la calabacita dish that looked liked it wasn't being served anymore. I like that this spot was lowkey, and not in the heart of wicker park.

Steak was more like a cube steak which I wouldn't expect for 20 dollars and the potatoes that came with the steak were hard and inedible.

We just parked right across the street with no problem. When we got inside we were seated right away. *amazing* The atmosphere was subdued which was nice.

We first started our with Pastelito de Cangrejo (crab cakes) which was garnished with jicama, cucumber, and avocado relish. So good and you can tell it was made to order. It was very fresh. Now for our main meal...my boyfriend ordered the Cochinita Pibil (braised pork shoulder which was slow roasted in banan leaves with black beans and habanero salsa) So so so good and the meat was so tender and melted in your mouth. I ordered the Pato Picoso which is grilled duck breast with orange black berry glaze on a bed of greens with pecans, goat cheese and a ginger honey vinaigrette. DELISH!

SERVICE:  Cordial, attentive but not rushed. The proprietor circulated and warmly greeted a few regulars while we were there. LIKED:  Someone in the kitchen knows what they're doing -- nice menu, well executed. Good flavors all around. Amazing molé (chocolaty, nutty, chili-kissed) on the lamb chops (borrego). Tender (and not stringy) cochinita pibil (pork shoulder) in a superb sauce. Corn tortillas and tortilla chips were very fresh & tasty, not greasy at all. This was a real find for me. I don't often dine in the Bucktown neighborhood, and this is a great choice (as is nearby Cumin). I'll make it a point to be back.",0.9941,0.744,0.246,0.01,0.5776374859708193

We can't come here without getting the ceviche, and we also tried the crab cake which was recommended by our server as one of his favorites.  For main entrees I got the filet which comes with grilled shrimp and sweet potato purée. My steak was cooked to perfection and literally melted in my mouth. There are no other words for how good it was. Hubby tried a special of skirt steak with cilantro pesto served with yuca and plantains. It was spicy but he loved it!!  Our service was fantastic.  Everyone is so friendly there. We actually got the opportunity to speak to Rick, the manager there, and give feedback about our previous experience. Las Palmas is a family run business and you can tell how passionate they are about it. Rick was so open to our feedback and how to make the dining experience better.

I was a bit confused when I ordered a ""House margarita"" and was told that for a dollar more the ""Fresca Margarita"" would be a better choice since they mix is made in house versus the ""house margarita""  that is store bought.  Chips and salsa - Chips were delicious but I didn't understand the ""salsa"" which consists of, what i believe is, canned tomato sauce with chopped up onions and cilantro. Overall, the food is bland... blah, blah, blah. They are almost afraid to add some spice into those dishes. The restaurant needs a face lift.

Irritating as all hell.  Insanely overpriced.

Was told a $28 carafe would provide 4 glasses. Catch is, they aren't wine glasses, but instead highball glasses.  I just didn't feel anything here was a standout..despite a dinner bill for 2 in excess of a $100, plus tax & tip.  For just a LITTLE more, I could have dined at a Fogo de Chao.  How they stay in business is beyond me. Yes, they smile. I would too if I was getting almost $30 for a carafe of cheap wine...just sayin'...  In summation, I dined in a nearly-empty, noisy sun-room with a sad view of tarp-covered patio furniture that piped in Top 40 tunes..while sitting beneath several burned out ceiling bulbs.

La Calabaza is essentially a saffron risotto that is packed full of flavor and incredibly savory. The taste lingers, and it's definitely divine.

2014-05-19,4.0,"Love, love, love that their menu reflects unique Mexican cuisine -- not the usual -- such as, tacos, tortas, burritos, enchilladas de pollo y carne asada. For my main course, I ordered callos de hacha because I am a huge scallops fan. They were perfectly prepared. These pan-seared scallops were dressed up over corn, purple potato, corn, and asparagus. It had a wonderful flavor. The raspberry-mezcal and roasted poblano vinaigrette provided the perfect amalgamation. This dish is worthy of five stars. For starters, I tried the Sopa del dia (soup of the day) which is made with locally fresh, quality ingredients. The sopa receives four stars. It was a little too salty for my taste, but otherwise, it was smooth, wonderful and flavorful. The Sopa del dia changes from day to day so ask ""what"" it is when you go. If you want more lime or cilantro just ask. They are happy to bring you the extra ingredients. If you like Sangria or frozen Margarita drinks order one or two. They are very, very good. Service was hospitable, fast and the food was spectacular. My friend, who is vegetarian, ordered La Calabaza. She said it was ""spectacular"" and very, very good. I asked her on a scale of 1 to 5, what would she rate this? She said ""Four"" stars. For dessert, my friend ordered the chocolate raspberry mouse and screamed after the first bite. People turned around to see what was wrong!  She smile and said ""Oh, this is a ten star dessert."" It was fantastic (according to her). I had the coconut flan and it was a gastronomical surprise. It contained pineapple and mint salsa and was topped off with fresh whipped cream. The texture was OMFG divine! There are tons of Mexican restaurants in Chicago. I prefer the Mexican restaurants located in the Pilsen neighborhood of Chicago. They are less pretentious. The Chef seriously knows how to prepare unique, delectable cuisine with a twist. There is ""live"" music every Tuesday and Friday. The outdoor patio is cozy, peaceful and beautiful, but it can get a little loud when crowded. There are several ""Las Palmas"" Mexican restaurants in the City. I don't know if they are or are not owned by the same individual. For a unique experience, in terms of Mexican cuisine, Las Palmas is a must. This is a great ""date"" restaurant. It is also a great place for catching up with friends. Las Palmas utilizes quality, fresh ingredients, the cuisine is excellent and unique, and the Service is always on-point. Everything about ""Las Palmas"" reminded me of ""Libertad"" in Skokie because of the ""unique"" cuisine (the Chef at Libertad has been voted one of the ""best"" new Chefs in Illinois). Las Palmas is more like a tossed salad with a really good sherry-truffle vinaigrette.

Both times I was there, I ordered their vegetable enchiladas, and they are DELICIOUS, especially the sauce. I've had a lot of enchiladas, and I love the ones here. My girlfriend ordered some squash and rice dish, which was also really good. We also got a pitcher of Margarita, and they didn't skimp on the alcohol. I think that this place was probably the best deal you could have got on Valentine's Day for the quality. The restaurant, has a dark and kind of relaxing / romantic atmosphere. Also, the restaurant had a singer / guitar player who walked around and serenaded the diners both times I was there. The singer definitely added to the romantic vibe, and he was pretty good too.

We were all so, so pleased with ourselves. There were stupid smiles all around!  Our table started with margaritas, fresh guacamole and Queso Fundido (sans chorizo for me, because my friends are lovely and super accomodating). The guac was fresh, but I like a little more cilantro and lime myself. No complaints though, as it IS guac which just so happens to be the best food on earth. The Queso Fundido, on the other hand, was an absolutely GLORIOUS blend of melted Chihuahua and goat cheese, with poblano peppers and oregano in the mix. It was gone SO fast, but my mouth will never forget it. It's a ""Must Order."" My friend Lynn and I found ourselves drooling over the same entrees, so we decided to split the Enchayotadas:  ""Corn tortillas stuffed with grilled chayotes, carrots, portabella mushrooms, and crispy corn chips bathed in a creamy jalapeño-tomatillo salsa topped with melted Chihuahua cheese, crema Mexicana, queso anejo and garlic vinaigrette salad."" RIGHT?! We also shared ""The World's Least-Sad Salad,"" a made up award I'm giving to the Ensalada de Alcachofa on account of its arugula, artichoke fritter, almond and manchego cheese mix, which was doused in white truffle oil. If someone had murdered me on the street immediately upon exiting the restaurant, I would have died a happy woman.  My boyfriend had the Lomo de Puerco, or, ""Oven roasted pork tenderloin served with bacon and cerveza de Victoria braised brussel sprouts, butternut squash puree. Drizzled with blueberry-habanero compote."" Judging from his face, it looked like that he would easily choose his entree over me if ever put in the position to decide.

Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, he came over right away to take our drink order. I started with a mojito that was one of the best I've had in a while. Not too sweet, just enough lime, great start to the meal. Sunny thoroughly enjoyed her margarita an Claire also enjoyed her wine. To start, we had the fresh-made guacamole with some spice. All of the ingredients tasted incredibly fresh and we devoured that pretty quickly! For dinner, we all went different routes with the scallops, seafood stew, and duck. It was extremely difficult for us to choose our entrees because everything sounded so delicious! Each entree is unique and contains many elements. I ended up going with the duck and was really happy with my choice. The meat was cooked perfectly and the accompanying sauce, spicy slaw, and sauteed spinach completed the dish.

Cons: - Although the actual pork shoulder in the cochinita pibil was well-seasoned and oh-so-tender in it's own delicious juices, the refried beans it was served with were bland and didn't add any positive flavors/texture/elements to the dish.  Kinda just there as a plate filler it seemed.  - On the pricier side for Mexican food but again, it's probably because I am usually satisfied with the $2-3 tacos in the city...  I think the least expensive entree was still $15+ - I was too full to try dessert :T",0.9981,0.735,0.244,0.02,0.6088654809243044

2013-10-26,5.0,"Let me preface this by saying that when I first came here for dinner, I was a little drunk and didn't think much of the food. Revisited this place in a sober state and I was simply blown away by the dishes. I'm glad my taste buds were in full working order this time around. Drink Order - a Twist on the traditional Paloma I felt like a Paloma (tequila, grapefruit soda, lime juice and salted rim), but the manager recommended their take on it, which included cucumber vodka. Hesitant at first, but it was actually quite good and refreshing. Appetizers - Pastelito De Cangrejo, pan-seared lump crab cake with jicama-cucumber-avocado relish jalapeno aioli... simply amazing.  Also, the Calabacita, a seasonal app, was a unique and pleasantly surprising dish. My friend placed the order so I didn't get to read the description, but noticed that it was served in a pumpkin. Cut a small piece and got a little bit of everything together in one spoon, took my bite, and it was sheer bliss. The mini-pumpkin is prepared with scallops, shrimp, spaghetti squash, and a white wine-epazote sauce. The sweetness of the squash and sauce went exceptionally well with the shrimp and scallops.  I didn't get to order an entree since I was already full by this point, but will definitely be back.",0.9907,0.785,0.187,0.028,0.5445134575569359

I hurts me to know that this place was right under my nose for 2 years when I lived in Wicker Park and I never got to try it. A friend was leaving for Germany and she wanted this place to be one of her last meals in Chicago. What a ringing endorsement!  We came over on a warm September evening; so warm we were able to sit on their back patio. We opened our dining experience with ceviche and a coconut mojito. The coconut mojito was out of this world ...the flavor rocked my taste buds in a way it has never been rocked before. Really was good!  For my meal, I went with the Costillas which is oven roasted pork ribs in a guava bbq sauce served with fries and corn salsa. The meal was delicious as the ribs were very tender and melted right off of the bone. The meal was sooo good I had o get another coconut mojito to accompany the delicious food.

The front dining room is small but there is additional dining in the rear and an outdoor patio. The menu features unique combinations of food and ingredients. It was a difficult decision to choose as each appetizer and entree had something special to say for itself.

My sister-in-law sent back the first dish she ordered (Pollo Mixto) because it came out not as described in the menu and was very disappointing. She asked for the Camarones-Chipotle in its place. The sauce on this dish was flavorless and the spinach was as salty as the sea. Only the shrimp in the dish was worth eating.  My mother ordered the Mixiote. Of all the entrees it was the best, but that's not saying much.  I can't remember what my brother ordered but it fell short of expectations like the rest of the dishes.

2013-08-06,5.0,"After dining at Las Palmas on North ave in Chicago we felt compelled to leave a review.             My wife and I, are always searching for a great place to dine. Although we make it a point to experience somewhere different each time, its always nice to have a favorite especially when it's local..        Las Palmas now holds our favorite spot for great food, and the ambiance it bestows engenders a warm and inviting atmosphere sought after by so many looking for a pleasant dining experience when out with the family or on a romantic date.        The most significant part of a great dining experience you may expect  at Las Palmas is every bit from soup to nuts and from entry to exit..  They hold the secret to what every restaurant strives for "" True achievement in every aspect of the industry""          In all the 15 years living in Chicago we constantly struggled to find the whole package, great food, great service and always a warm welcome.. Then there it was, a quaint little restaurant with murals on their outside walls, strutting the Art of local talent located in the heart of the Wicker Park, Bucktown area.       What was truly remarkable was the fact that this restaurant has been around for quite some time, and it was located only 4 blocks from our house. Tough to believe that the restaurant that was right under our noses would be the answer to all our aspirations, becoming our favorite place to dine.           Our only disappointment was not discovering this restaurant sooner. I can only depict with little certainty that I will be able to give proper merit to this establishment that undeniably deserves.  Here is a meek attempt at best to sum up what I experienced and what anyone can expect.          To start off the evening, as we entered the restaurant a most gracious host with a charismatic smile cordially greeted us, and although the restaurant was busy we were still seated promptly. As the hostess welcomed us she made friendly gestures at my three year old, getting the evening off to a good start. Shortly there after the owner of what seemed to be a family owned business took time out of his busy agenda to greet us.         As a welcome, he offered us an array of tropical drinks to get us started one of which was a special of the house called a coconut mojito, delicious!          Having tried many Mexican restaurants we thought we had an idea what to expect since not many of them acquired an original or unique taste. Boy were we in for a ride. We didn't have to wait long after our drinks were served to place our order. Unaware of what we were about to feast upon, we picked out 2 starters. The Empanada, cornmeal turnovers stuffed with fresh shrimp and crab with an accompaniment of a variety of cheese gently placed on a plate with a tangy sauce and we ordered Costillas oven roasted pork ribs served in a tamarindo salsa garnished with mango, the most memorable thought as the meat fell right off the bone. It was now time to pick a main, which in my opinion only spiked my curiosity of what to expect, since we were still raving about the starters, l expected nothing less than truly superb going forward.     As we waited my wife ordered some guacamole of which I was never a fan but when my wife asked me to taste it I didn't hesitate, as everything I tasted so far was fantastic. After that I am now a big fan.          Now, for the entrées. My wife ordered the Mar Y Tierra a 4 oz fillet mignon tender as butter, grilled to perfection served with pan-seared shrimp alongside sweet potatoes and sautéed baby spinach. and I ordered La Casa Borracha -a pineapple and tequila soaked skirt steak on a stack of rum-cured plantains,  a taste like nothing to be found anywhere in the City, which was  consistent to the appetizers, in my wife's own words ""FABULOUS"". Every dish was prepared and served to perfection.  My kudos to the Chef on that!!!!          The whole meal was incomparably delicious, and impeccably timed, and the service was equally amazing, completely professional and yet warmly welcoming as expected, since great food usually goes hand in hand with great service. The waitress Jenna was splendid and delightful.      Just when we thought we couldn't eat anymore we were presented with a fascinating selection of desserts. We were advised from Jenna to try a salted caramel ice-cream with whipped sour cream on top a very fruity crumbled pistachios with a salted caramel taco shell. DELICIOUS and exquisitely unique to say the least!!!  Keep in mind ----we are tough critics being from the Capital of Great food ----New York.     More importantly the prices at Las Palmas are very modest especially given the quality of food.  M Summation: The food varied from very great to exceptionally excellent.  Needless to say we went back many times with friends The food was in all our opinions, immensely flavorful and brilliantly creative Michael & Roseanne Denigris",0.9995,0.767,0.212,0.02,0.6421733569460842

2013-05-15,5.0,"I flew in to Chicago on a Cinco de Mayo evening, and I wanted some really good Mexican food, preferably at a place that had tasty drinks. So my cousin took me here. It's pricier than your typical hole-in-the-wall burrito joint, but it is so worth it. Here's what we got (we were on the company dime, so it's kind of a lot): Drinks: Watermelon Mojito - extremely refreshing and very dangerous as you can't really taste the alcohol. The margarita with Agave in it - again, couldn't taste the alcohol. But it definitely got me buzzing. It was quite tasty. Jarisco Margarita - I wasn't sure how I'd feel about this - vanilla and margaritas didn't make sense to me, but the drink was highly recommended. We ordered around and were very glad we did. It's sweet, but not overly so. It doesn't taste like a traditional margarita, but it lived up to the hype. Savory Ceviche - I like fish ceviche. I've had better, but only from a hole in the wall Los Angeles Mexican butcher shop, which is really kind of the gold standard with these things. Still pretty tasty. La Casa Borracha - This dish will haunt me. It was that good. I ordered it rare and it was just so tasty, juicy and slightly sweet. The plantains were tempered by the potatoes, and their light sweetness complimented the steak's marinade very well. I ate all of it.  Cochinita Pibil - I would say this is on par with the Casa Borracha, but more filling (either that or I am just a little piggy and my cousins have more self control. Or both!) The habanero sauce on the side is spicy for real. And I'm a girl with a high spice tolerance. Use sparingly, but definitely use because it really compliments the dish. Sweet Meringue de Almendra - We could not stop eating those meringue bits. I feel like a lot of meringue just tastes the same - light and sweet. But you could really taste the almond. The berry compote was a nice contrast. Trio de Nieves - I grew up eating fresh tropical fruit and I can tell you with true conviction that those sorbets are legit. We had pineapple, guave and mango and they tasted like the actual fruit pulp, not from a store bought puree of any kind. We lucked out and got seated right away on the patio, but it was pretty chilly so I would recommend making reservations in advance and sitting inside unless the weather is really awesome.

2013-03-30,3.0,"For some reason I still can't seem to grasp the fact that every time I try a Mexican restaurant outside of the Ravenswood/Lincoln Square area I'm always sorely disappointed. After reading the raving reviews of Las Palmas, I decided to make a reservation and try their take on Mexican food. Upon arrival we were greeted by the hostess and ushered the glass room that is past the kitchen. We were squeezed in between two other couples, which was a bit awkward as I felt a little too close for comfort. Luckily the live music got louder a few minutes after we arrived, so I didn't feel like we were too intrusive on their conversation (and vise versa). The waiter brought over chips and salsa shortly after we were seated and asked if we wanted to put in a drink order. My boyfriend inquired about their beer list, as we were only given a cocktail and wine list when we were seated. He rattled off about ten or so different Mexican beers, and we both went with the Pacifico. When he brought these to us we put in an order of the guacamole spicy style and sipped on our beers while it was being prepared at the guacamole station a few feet away. When the guacamole arrived, it left a bit to be desired. For $9 I expected something more. It tasted under-seasoned and was in great need of some salt and pepper. It wasn't as spicy as we would have liked, so if I were to order this again I would probably ask for it to be extra spicy. Those misgivings aside, the ingredients that went into the guacamole were all fresh themselves, and the avocados were perfectly ripe. As per the usual, we decided to order two entrees and split them to get more of a sampling of the menu. I chose the La Casa Borracha which consisted of a pineapple and tequila soaked skirt steak on a stack of rum-cured plantains and papas fritas with mango pico de gallo. This whole dish was a little sweet for my liking and the steak came out more done than the medium temperature that I requested. The plantains were under cooked and a little tough. The mango pico de gallo sounded amazing, but the mangoes were anything but ripe, which was very disappointing. My boyfriend went with the Cochinita Pibil, which was a braised pork shoulder slow roasted in banana leaves and served with refried black beans and a side of habanero salsa. This dish was definitely the winner of the evening as the pork was very tender and flavorful and went wonderfully with the black beans. He chose to have the corn tortillas on the side, and all the flavors melted together wonderfully when wrapped in the tortillas. I don't think I'd come back to Las Palmas given the wonderful Mexican establishments that are all within walking distance of my apartment. Although, that being said, I don't feel like the Wicker Park/Bucktown area has much going for it in terms of Mexican restaurants so I can see the appeal of this restaurant for the area. It also seems quite pricey for what you get, considering our bill was nearly $80 after tax and tip. We did leave with full stomachs, but for that price tag I'd much rather go elsewhere in the area.",0.9855,0.89,0.083,0.027,0.45536666666666664

I expected the pace to be leisurely and they were pretty good about taking our orders and getting us food and watery drinks (see below).

So it wasn't just like ""meh these are weak drinks, I'm trying to get drunk and I can't, boo hoo."" It was like there was literally no alcohol. If its a $3 drink, by all means, water that shit down.

We ordered guacamole, some rib special on their special menu, tilapia taco, and pork loin. Their guacamole was freshly made (I saw someone standing at the guaca station and made it from scratch). It's definitely one of the best guacamole I've had. The rib special (don't remember the name) was AMAZING! The meat fell right off the bones, seasoned very well, and the sauce added a bit spice to it but not overwhelming. More importantly, it's already a lot of food and we haven't even had our entrees yet.  Then here came the entrees. My fish tacos were tasty and BIG, and there were three of them. One bite and I couldn't stop eating. My husband's pork loin was very moist and tender, which is really hard to achieve as most places have dry/tough pork loin. We think this was the second best pork loin we've had, behind Ruxbin (which is really nothing to be ashamed of, Ruxbin's pork loin is unreal).

I love a good Mexican brunch and my boyfriend is always looking to try  a new michelada, so we figured this would be a good bet. Also, there was a Yelp deal for a free guacamole!* Unfortunately, I think they might have been having an off day. While our food was okay, it didn't leave any lasting impressions. My Huevos con Chorizo were vastly overcooked and chopped up so fine that I kept having to scoop the grains onto my fork with a knife. They were also served on the colder side of lukewarm. The salsa that came with the chips was tomato-y and tasted like it came straight out of a jar. Still, my Mexican hot chocolate was fantastic, and the chips and guac were tasty. Las Palmas, you had so much promise! - *I realized belatedly that the free guac deal was supposed to be used with dinner...but the waiter let us have it for free anyways.

Guacamole was made table side. Wish the cilantro was a bit finer, but who complains about cilantro? The more the merrier.  My bf got the chicken fajitas. Perfect portion for one person. No leftovers here.  They have daily specials. I was intrigued by the pumpkin margarita, but I figured that although it sounds good, it could also go terribly wrong. I got the house margarita instead.

The food.... was A-OK.  I order the talapia tacos since that seemed to be all the rave on yelp, but they were not all that.  Maybe because I make some mean fish tacos nicely seasoned with a chipotle cream sauce, so I am a little hard on other folks fish taco cooking.  My drunk guy had the duck breast in the prize winning mole sauce.

We visit at least five times a year and have never once, in ten years, had a bad meal here and last night was no exception. We travel a lot to Mexico and eat at many of Chicago's low- and high-budget Mexican restaurants and this remains one of our favorites. For an upscale take on Mexican food that manages to feel down home at the same time, you can't go wrong with Las Palmas.  Seating both inside and on the spacious patio is comfortable and accommodating and service is well paced, friendly and efficient. Every dish comes out well made and seasoned to perfection with sauces and sides that complement every forkful. Desserts are top notch and their house margarita and guacamole should not be missed. Prices are very reasonable and portions are large, so come with an appetite and you will leave a very happy and very satisfied person. I love everything, but here are some of my favorite dishes: EMPANADAS: Corn meal turnovers stuffed with shrimp, crab meat, epazote, Chihuahua cheese, manchego cheese, and peanut-jalepeno salsa.  CALLOS DE HACHA: Pan-seared scallops over a crispy arepa with creamy Poblano salsa & vegetable ragout.  CAMARONES: Pan-seared shrimp smothered in white wine-mojo de ajo & served with plantains.  TAQUITOS DE POLLO: Chicken barbacoa taquitos with watercress, salsa cruda, pickled red onions, queso anejo, and crème-fraiche. GUACAMOLE: Chunky avocado dip made tableside to your degree of spiciness. FISH TACOS: Pan-seared tilapia with jicama, mango, cucumber & soy-serrano aioli. CAMARONES EN PINA: Pan-seared tiger shrimp over a tomato, pineapple & coconut salsa. Served with white risotto, plantains and roasted pineapple. BARBACOA DE CORDERO: Braised lamb in guajillo peppers, maguey and avocado leaves served atop Mole de Mayo with asparagus & a crispy arepa. Voted best mole in Chicago 2011 and definitely worth a try! TEQUILERO: Grilled 9oz rib-eye steak atop a tequila-pasilla salsa and shallot butter, accompanied by pistachio roasted potatoes and asparagus.  LA CASA BORRACHA: Pineapple and tequila soaked skirt steak on a stack of rum-cured plantains and papas fritas  with mango pico de gallo.

She was very attentive and came  around often to ask how we were doing and to refill our margaritas. No complaints about the food either, absolutely delicious. I felt this place is a bit on the pricey side, hence the 4 stars. For our group of 10, it came out to $45 per person.

On to the food...the fish tacos are really good. The jicama, mango and cucumber slaw is so refreshing. Another great entree is the ""La Casa Borracha,"" which is pineapple and tequila soaked skirt steak served with plantains.

What a shame, because the food and service are great! The decor is... odd... but they have a great patio in back that you can't see from the street. I wonder if this is what makes people pass it by. We had a reservation through Open Table and a groupon for dinner, which I specified on the reservation. I sometimes wonder if those two things will affect staff attitudes, but we had very friendly, attentive, and speedy service. Started with a pomegranate margarita and, my personal favorite, the coconut mojito. They have a great, varied drink menu, which is nice because I don't drink tequila. Most cocktails will set you back $10 a piece, and pitchers of margaritas varied from $22-38 which would be great for groups.  Started with mild guacamole from the guac station. Yum. Followed up with the scallop appetizer. I LOVE scallops and these were not overcooked! Whoot! They had a great, creamy poblano sauce over them and they paired perfectly with the corn arepa underneath. Loved it. For the main course, we shared the fish tacos. This is not normally something I would get (especially at a more upscale restaurant), but we couldn't decide between the beef dishes and settled on sharing it. OMG we were both glad we did! All of the fruits and veggies in the taco were julienne'd and crunchy and crisp.  We even wrote down the ingredients so that we could try to replicate them back at home.

For mains, I ordered the amazing Casa Borracha.  Pineapple and tequila soaked skirt steak served on a Lincoln log-style stack of rum-cured plantains and fried potato logs (is how I'd describe them).  The steak was perfectly cooked and super tender.  The flavors were delicious.  The plantains were super sweet and fantastic.  The mango pico was refreshing.  I totally had the winning dish! My friend ordered the Barbacoa de Cordero, lamb in mole.  The menu brags it was voted the best mole of 2011.  Not being an avid fan, I can just report that it was good, but cannot comment on it's superiority over others.  The lamb was tender but too lamb-y for my taste.  He liked it.  The crispy arepa were sort of like cheesy cornbread biscuits.  Good, but not great. I had read mixed things about the margaritas, including a so-so review from a friend, so we stuck with beer.  They have a selection of about 6 or 7 Mexican beers, so don't worry, you won't get stuck drinking Corona.

The back room is an attached green house. The plants, artwork and warm lighting makes this space feel cozy and vibrant. Being winter we didn't make it outside to the patio, but I did take a peek and it looks like a real hidden gem.  For the pre fixe menu I chose a steak, salmon and vegetarian option. I had the salmon. It was served with rice and asparagus. The salmon was very fresh, juicy and cooked to perfection. The asparagus was crisp and the rice was flavorful. A delicious meal overall. I had a taste of the steak and it was also very well done. I might have to order it myself when I return. I will definitely be going back often.  The service was flawless!

I'm sure the dilution was helped along by the fact there was ice IN the carafe, not just our glasses.  They should have honored the drink special price, because for the difference of $9 they have lost a repeat customer.

We went medium and I tested my spice tolerance. My tongue was burning, but it was tasty, so I kept eating. It's made fresh; we saw the man making it in a molcajete a few feet away. 2) Caipirinha Mexicana. I love caipirinhas, and this one had a twist of the addition of mezcal. I like bitter old man liquors, but mezcal is me being adventurous. The smokeyness is interesting territory for me and something I have to be in the mood for. A friend of mine had the watermelon mojito and that was very fresh tasting. 3) Enchayotadas. This was one of the entrees the waitress recommended. Actually, most of the ones she recommended were the vegetarian ones. Oddly, I was sold on the fact that this had chayote, a vegetable I hadn't had in forever.The corn tortillas were filled with still crispy chayote, carrots, mushrooms and cornchips and then covered with a delicious creamy jalapeno tomatillo sauce.

Their website says that they sometimes have live bands, but the night I was there it was comfortably quiet.  I was here about a year ago and don't remember exactly what we ordered--so I can't give one of those excruciatingly detailed reviews that expounds on all the ingredients in my entree or the waiter's every move.

It was a no brain-er.  We had a very nice and attentive waitress that was very good at explaining any questions we had about the menu. We shared the shrimp appetizer and the veggie enchiladas. Everything was so yummy. The presentation was great too. The shrimp was nice and crispy, and the enchiladas had a very nice blend of flavors with veggies I would never think of being in one. Best enchiladas I've had ever and the salsa that's on top was so good we got every last bit of it using the chips as spoons. They even got props in TimeOut Chicago mag as one of the top 100 things to eat in the Chi! Awesome! (for a great detailed description on our food we ordered check out Jessica B.'s review!)  I have to mention the margaritas and chips and salsa. The margaritas were made perfect and come in rad etched glasses. Nice and strong. The chips and salsa were some of the best I've had. I think they make their chips there and infuse them with lime juice. I couldn't stop eating them!!! The salsa was perfect for me. I like it just spicy enough to where I can still taste the flavors.

2010-12-10,4.0,"What a pleasant surprise on a windy, snowy night!  I was shopping with my friend at Cherry Bomb and we were both famished. Neither one of us familiar with restaurants in the area, we headed down the block to see what we could find. With the cold wind blowing the snow into our faces we were delighted to come upon Las Palmas. From the outside it looked so warm and cozy - without hesitation we walked in and were promptly welcomed and seated in a booth nestled in the front window.  Our server promptly approached us and immediately took our drink orders (margaritas) and at the same time another server presented us with warm tortilla chips (amazing) that had a hint of lime in them and salsa. The salsa was good but not quite spicy enough for my taste but fresh and delicious nonetheless.  The dining room is intimate with low lighting and candles on the table which add to the overall ambiance and charm. The walls are covered with amazing artwork - I am not sure if they showcase local artists and/or change what is hanging on their walls regularly or not - I will have to go back and find out more about this. It seems like it would be a great place for a date or a small group.  The food was delicious. It is not a traditional Mexican restaurant with tacos, burritos & tamales. It is so much better and so much more than that. My only regret is that we did not order more items to try (but what we did order filled us up)!  We started with Arepa Con Camaron (Four crispy shrimps with cheese infused arepa, mescal pico de gallo, and fresh horseradish cream). The breading on the Shrimp was to die for - so crispy. It was a very fresh tasting dish and the flavors really complimented eachother. If I were to order this again I would probably ask for a little extra horseradish cream only because I love spice a little too much.  For the main course we chose to split the Enchayotadas (Corn tortillas stuffed with grilled chayotes, carrots, portobello mushrooms, and crispy corn chips bathed in a creamy jalapeño-tomatillo salsa topped with melted Chihuahua cheese, crema Mexicana, queso añejo, & garlic vinaigrette salad). We first requested our server to explain a chayote to us which she described as a Mexican Squash. Intrigued by this, we had no idea what to expect but were looking forward to the surprise. The corn tortillas were fresh, the carrots crisp and the chayotes okay (I did not think they had a very distinctive flavor). I didn't see very many portobello mushrooms though and think this dish would be better if there were more of all the fillings except for the carrots. I found the carrots to be slightly overwhelming and stealing the show from the chayotes, which based on the name of the dish, I expected to be the star. The salsa served on the plate with this dish was pretty good but once again, I wished there had been a little bit more spice. Overall the flavors went well together and I found myself trying to soak up the extra sauce with the tortilla chips!  In sum, the value here is great, the ambiance amazing, service impeccable and food good. I left full and satisfied. My one wish though is for more spice, please.",0.9983,0.776,0.186,0.038,0.5228942152855196

Very nicely layered flavors, complex, but very simple.   The desserts were just as outstanding as everything else.  From a peach tart with chamomile honey ice cream to chocolate mousse from heaven.   I cant wait to go back with the little one, (which eats free on the weekdays with purchase of adult entree) she will dig the ambiance which is very flirty and fun and very creative/artistic.",0.9895,0.788,0.201,0.011,0.6046380952380953

I ordered the skirt steak with beefsteak tomatoes, goat cheese, and arugula drizzled with a vinagerette.

2010-11-07,5.0,"Heck YES!!!! Great find! My birthday recently passed and this year I had major difficulty deciding on a restaurant for a group of us to get together and celebrate my nongraceful passing of another year.  My original thought was a byob Mexican joint.  Nothing fit the bill.  It seems in the Mexican realm if you are looking for byob that kind of means that you're basically going to a taco stand - or at least a place where you order at a counter and bring your food to a table.  Then I thought of byob sushi.  That too fell through.  What I was looking for was good food at a price I wouldn't feel embarrassed or ashamed to ask 15 other people to pay in my honor. This excursion did have a very worrisome beginning.  We had made a reservation and had to wait 45 minutes after our reservation was scheduled for until we were sat.  Yikes.  However, to apologize they bought us 2 pitchers of margaritas!  Yippee!  Oh, and while waiting at the bar I sipped on one of their premium margaritas - 2nd best margarita I've ever had!  Wowie! So once we sat we had chips, salsa, and guac.  Delish.  One of the guacs had a bit of a kick too it too - added bonus.  For my main dish, I had the acorn squash risotto.  HOLY GUACAMOLE!  It was outstanding.  Voted best dish at the table.  Almost everyone got something different and everyone was satisfied.  Oh and they had a pumpkin (I believe) soup that was outrageos. So, from this review it can be deduced that we all ate very well, were thoroughly stuffed, and happily buzzed off great marg's.  And guess how much it cost us - well, i mean them, since it was my bday I wasn't required to pitch in.  Only $25 a person!  Now THAT is chingon!",0.9927,0.804,0.166,0.03,0.5028333333333334

On of my biggest issues with restaurants in Chicago is that many of them are pretentious.  The more popular, fancier, or ""more gourmet,"" the place, the more pretentious.  In the world of gourmet Mexican food, the perfect example is Frontera Grill or any of the Rick Bayless places.  You wait for over an hour, get shuffled into a bar that is packed wall to wall, and when you finally get your table (about 30minutes later than what they told you), if you look around, you'll notice half the place is empty.   On the other hand, if you look carefully, places like Las Palmas have better food, better service, and better management.  We went for a birthday and they even brought out a small slice of cake for my mother-in-law.  All the food tasted fresh, made to order, and full of flavor.  Even more impressive, is that the food tasted as expected from the descriptions on the menu.  This may sound easy, but not always accomplished.   We generally eat early because we have a daughter that has an early bedtime, she doesn't do great in crowds, and we don't like to inconvenience other with our little one.  Nobody at the restaurant minded that she walked around, stood right by the guitarist, and even put on a little dance number. We had the empanadas, guac, scallops, pork chop, skirt steak, and bread pudding.  Everything was perfect.   The only issue was the prices.  A little on the high side, so I won't go there all the time, but definitely at the top of my list when looking for something nice.",0.9799,0.823,0.147,0.031,0.5680398671096346

We sat on the back patio, which was fantastic.  They had a mariachi-esque singer back there who sang traditional Mexicano canciones as well as pop hits like UB40's Red Wine.  The clientele is relaxed - families having celebratory dinners, a few kids running around, your run-of-the-mill douchebags enjoying a night with their bros. We looked at the entrees and nothing jumped out at us, so we decided to split a few appetizers, many of which sounded great.  We decided to try the guac, crab cake, flautas, and empanadas.  I also had a watermelon mojito to drink.  Our food came out super fast - though a little ill-timed.  It all came at once besides the guac, which is the one thing we would have liked first.  It also would have been nice to space it out, but I guess we should have specified that. The crab cake was great.  Along with the flautas, they were the two best things we tried.  The crab cake comes with a delish and fresh salsa, and the flautas are served hot and crispy, with a really yummy green sauce.  The empanada was a total dud.  I should have known when I ordered a 4-cheese empanada, but it was just a solid brick of cheese inside.  I was expecting something more traditional instead of what was essentially cheese in a pocket.  The guac was just OK - nothing special but nothing terrible either.

2010-05-19,5.0,"A friend and I ate the best meal of our lives here. Seriously - it's the closest I've ever come to ordering a meal again for dessert...  For starters, we split the guacamole - which was nice. The place reminded us a lot of a ""Rosa Mexicano"" Restaurant (I'm pretty sure they're opening one in Chicago too) which is an upscale Mexican restaurant that serves freshly made guacamole as well.  What set this meal apart from any meal I've ever had at Rosa Mexicano was the inventiveness. We were both immediately drawn the braised lamb shank over the wild mushroom and sweet potato risotto. It's hard enough to find a reasonably priced braised lamb shank on a menu, let alone an interesting combination like sweet potato in risotto. When the lamb shanks arrived they came with large steak knives, but we didn't use them once. The meat was so moist and tender that with just a flick of our knives, the meat fell off the bone. We didn't need to use more than the back of the fork to split the meat into bite-sized pieces. The sweet potato with the wild mushroom risotto was the perfect compliment to this earthy meal. This meal was SO GOOD we almost didn't order dessert because we wanted to end it on a good note.  The waiter talked us into a chocolate tomale served with vanilla ice cream, strawberry sauce, and fresh raspberries and mint. It sounded so strange we had to try it - masa and chocolate? We split it and it was DIVINE. We didn't say a word while we ate it.  I don't know whether every dish is like this on the menu or if we just ordered the right things throughout the night, but this was quite possibly the best meal I've ever eaten.

The vegan plate was a gorgeous spread of roasted veggies...baby carrots, shredded brussel sprouts, artichoke, plantain, oyster mushrooms, and sauteed spinach.  Now as if all of that wasn't enough there was a side of their vegan rice and a banana leaf boat of black beans in the center.  I should have taken a picture!

2009-06-23,4.0,"Was about to write a review but after reading Ruben L's I was pressed to do better, so I'll just add some trivial banter. There's not much to not like about Las Palmas.  Friendly hostess/greeter, who accommodated us despite our lack of confirmation(?) on our reservation for a large party.  That was strange, she mentioned something about the booker failing to call the restaurant back and confirm - but usually that's still a written down reservation, no?  The outdoor patio was full, but it was a bit breezy outside so that was ok.  She placed us in this funky greenhouse space - nice, bright white walls with a glass see-though roof.  There were what seemed like yet-to-be customized window drapes that already had an agent business card attached to them. When we read the menu it said something to the extent of  ""one bowl of chip and salsa per party"".  Well, we were a party of 16, lucky for us they fulfilled our requests for more than 2 bowls.  The guacamole here was good, but rather stingy in portion.  The cerviches were ok, not unfresh, but only the Maya version stood out on my palette.  The fajitas we ordered were great though.  The shrimp were definitely prawn-sized, and I wonder if they used home-grown chicken b/c it was very tender.  Steak wasn't bad either.  B/c we ordered all 3 to share, they brought it out on top of this huge platter that was quite impressive.  I even liked the margaritas, and I generally don't.  Fun times!",0.9952,0.678,0.243,0.079,0.5247400109469075

Their guacamole and salsa are quite tasty (mandatory for Mexican restaurants for me) and the food is very satisfactory, but as a vegetarian there is not a lot offered on the menu for me except for the portabella mushroom fajitas, which are good but not worth the price. My carnivore friends have always enjoyed their food though, and their brunch really helped me through a major hangover.  And for that I will always be grateful.",0.9855,0.749,0.235,0.015,0.4878787878787879
2009-06-01,4.0,"4.5- this place was pretty damn good. Came out here a few weeks ago with some friends of ours.  My friend was asking what we were in the mood for, and I said Mexican.  I was expecting him to suggest a taqueria or something like that.  Instead we ended up here.  Definitely not disappointed. AMBIENCE- this place is definitely ""quaint.""  The place is small and dark, but definitely has a lively feel to it.  Fortunately for us, the weather was nice and we dined out back.  The back was had an enclosed area, but was still fairly airy.  The decor was all white, and had a hip feel to it.  It looked like they had some seating that was ""uncovered"" but was not set up quite yet. SERVICE- the place was pretty busy (as would be expected on a Friday evening).  Our server was very friendly, and fairly responsive.  He seemed to be pretty knowledgable about the menu, and made us feel good about our order by adding ""that's my favorite"" or ""excellent choice.""  Sometimes, you need that kind of reassurance. MENU- defintely a step up from the hole in the walls and taco trucks I'm used to dining at.  I dare say this place has a ""modern"" interpretation on Mexican dining (what the hell does modern mean anyways?).  Sure they have tacos, fajitas, and enchiladas, but they also have items you don't see at taco bell, such as pork chops in a mole sauce, chicken milaneza, and other specialties.  You'd be hard pressed to not find something you would like. FOOD- we started out with the fresh made guacamole which was excellent.  My wife ordered something to the effect of slow roasted pork, while our companions ordered the pork chops in mole, and the other ordered the enchayotadas (similar to a vegetarian enchilada in a cream sauce).  I thought I'd step out a bit, and got ""la casa borracha"" which was a pineapple and tequila soaked skirt steak. I must say EVERYTHING (including the vegetarian dish) were awesome!  One of the things I like most about dining in groups (at least the groups I roll in) is that everyone shares a little bit of their dish with everyone.  My wife's pork was tender, but a little dry, still good though.  I think we all agreed the star of the evening was my dish.  The steak was so tender.  Who knew skirt steak could taste like that!? OVERALL- definitely glad my friend took us here.  Most dishes are between $15-$20, so your'e definitely not breaking the bank by dining here.  Check this place out if you happen to be in the area.

2009-03-01,4.0,"Warning: Some names have been altered to protect the innocent... or I just met them this night and really don't know them that well to include crazy stories about them. Seven of us from my work descended on Las Palmas for a Thursday night gathering. It had been a long while since I have joined this group. This crazy, insane, lovely, drink till you get waaaaay too happy, balls to the wall group. I have my reasons, mainly waking up early the next morning reasons. Starving for sustenance, parched for libations, eager to let what hair was there down and have a good time. The place didn't disappoint on many levels.  Having conversed with the lovely and up and coming yelper Nicki W, earlier, she had mentioned it was ""nice and intimate"", and I could very much agree with that. Especially the up front area. I hope the fire isn't up and going in the summer time, but it did provide a nice little warmth on this cold, rain soaked, night. The interior of the front, especially at night, is dim, sultry, perfect for the few brave couples that braved the night to savor their evening together. My group on the other hand were looking for tequila lime laced drinks. And a lot of them. We were sat in the back area, where quickly we were the only table back there. Although it was sweltering when we got there, (I blame it on our attractive female companions raising the temperature of the place), they were able to cool off the area to a more comfortable climate. Our sever was great, immediately attentive and friendly, laying out the specials of the night, but really, what caught our ears was the pitcher of margaritas. We tried that and one each of their cucumber lime margarita and their special blood orange margarita. The margaritas were good, the cucumber one would be perfect to revive oneself on a hot August day while the blood orange, although not sweet, it certainly was flavorful. Of course we kept our mojo rising by ordering several pitchers of their special margaritas through out the night.  The appetizers we started with were good, we went with the the trio of ceviches and the guacamole. The guacamole was flavorful, though I though could have used a little more salt and perhaps just a touch more heat. The ceviches, we did have a little problem. Although the blue marlin was great, the sea bass with the counter balance of the citrus and the playful slight heat of the habaneros made for a delicious starter. However the tuna one was off. After a bite from a few people in our group, it tasted fishy and not in a good way. We told our server who quickly removed it and replaced both of our tuna's with another one which escapes my memory. I blame the margaritas.  I will also blame them for the lack of knowing everything everyone had that night. I do want to bore you with high lights though. My friend Casey had the salmon which was cooked to medium quite well and the poblano rice had great seasoning with just a hint of heat. It blended well with the pumpkin seed mojo that it came with. The conchinita which I have had several times at other restaurants is one of my favorites. A tender broken down pieces of pork shoulder, with a searing habanero hot sauce on the side. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it. I will say their pork was great, the pieces of meat were tender and falling apart, the sauce was interesting, the heat was most certainly there, however there was a sweetness to it with a slight spice that I am not used to, it was good. J.K. had an amazing Pollo Oaxaca, where the meat was super tender and very flavorful. I had a little bit of plate envy. G.S. had a great tilapia with a spiced rice that certainly caught your attention. J.B. had an intensely flavored Las Palmas enchiladas which were simply straight forward kick ass.  We did do dessert, which did not kick ass. We got three different plates, sadly the one that seemed to have garnered any praise was their special dessert for the month. Sadly, it wasn't that great. More flavorless then a note to finish on. The chocolate cake was dry, there was a banana and plantain tart that did nothing for me. I felt if they were going to go in a direction, really head and go way over the line in that direction. The desserts seemed to timid.  Las Palmas is not timid, the food is balanced well, more than your typical Tex-Mex joint, but not over the top fancy schmansey. As I have said previously before, they balance things pretty well. The service was friendly, our guitar player rocked and played the songs we requested, (everything from John Denver, (um ew.. so not mine), to his own original work). Really helped the evening go from a deluge of rain to one that flooded our senses and left our faces grinning from ear to ear.

2009-03-01,5.0,"The only negative things I can think to write about Las Palmas is the fact that our pre-dinner bar bill was more expensive than our entire dinner bill (damn premium shots of tequila!) and that the bar has what is quite possibly the most disturbing piece of artwork I've ever seen displayed in a restaurant.  The ambiance here is second to none. We were placed in what must be the best seat in the house: A cozy booth right in the front by the windows, but by looking around the front room of Las Palmas, I don't think we could have gone wrong at any table. It's super-sexy and sophisticated.... and out and out romantic. The one problem I had was with the huge, weird painting in the bar. It included, but was not limited to: an in utero fetus, sperm chasing eggs, Mayan warriors, George Washington and a very, very large, anatomically correct beating heart. I really hope I was hallucinating.  The food is, quite simply, amazing. The guac, prepared your choice of mild, medium or spicy, was creamy and perfect. My enchiladas looked a little dicey due to the mole sauce, but were exquisite. They were perfectly seasoned and were presented with just the right amount of lettuce, Mexican crema and a touch of cheese. Mmmmm. The steak tacos were also delish, although I was only able to snag a quick taste.

The trio of ceviches was fantastic with the tuna and shrimp being my favorite. If only ordered one of the ceviches it would be the ceviche maya which is the tuna and shrimp.  For dinner I had Costillas de Borrego, a rack of lamb with a sweet potato cake and asparagus. The lamb was cooked just how I like it, medium with a little pink. I wish the rack had a little more meat on it, but overall I was very happy with it. The pomegranate salsa amplified the lambs overall richness and succulence The sweet potato cake was a very pleasant surprise. The only that was lacking was desert. We had the Tarta Bananera.

On a good day, the food and service are superb, and paying $100 for a dinner for two (which includes, admittedly, a lot of margaritas) doesn't offend me. The problem is that the food and service here are pretty hit or miss, so you'll get two or three so-so meals for every great meal. I usually start with the guacamole, which is made tableside and is always delicious. There's enough served to you that I'd warn a group of 2 off of getting it unless you're super hungry, or have far more self-control than the fat kid in me that rears its ugly head when Mexican food is involved. I've had a number of entrees here, usually some sort of chicken, and can highly recommend the chicken tacos and pollo oaxaca. My husband usually gets enchiladas, which are good, or the tampiquena, which is a steak served with an enchilada on the side.  I'm not much of a dessert person, but my husband always gets dessert and gives them the thumbs up.  Also? The margaritas are pretty top notch, but they've raised the prices of them in the last year, which is a bit of a bummer if you want to drink something above the house drink level so that the tequila doesn't make you want to wish for death the next morning. On the upside, I suppose the higher prices encourage me to drink more moderately. As I said, if you're there on a good night, you're going to have a truly great meal.

As far as the ambiance goes, it is a nice, cozy, dark restaurant that is longer than it is wide.  Therefore, I was feeling a bit claustrophobic upon arrival, but was able to survive.  We sat down at a table near the back of the house and were immediately approached by a waiter who suggested a pitcher of premium Sauza margaritas ($35) as well as some fresh guacamole ($12).  Noticing I was immediately out 50 clams within one minute of sitting down,  my cheap-ass needed to be careful as I navigated the menu. The margaritas, guacamole and complimentary chips and salsa soon arrived, and I was immediately glad we ordered both.  The margaritas were amazing and went nicely with the fresh, spicy guacamole.  I love spicy food, but my better half thought the guacamole was a little too spicy for her.  No worries...just more guac for the C-dog! Anyway, I honestly can't remember what we ordered, as we both decided to order an entree that we found ""interesting.""  All I know is my main squeeze got some sort of fajita dish that included cactus, while I got some sort of chicken dish that consisted of two grilled chicken breasts lying on top of some sort of green polenta-type bed, smothered in a red sauce.  Needless to say, we were both competely stuffed after consuming our food and beverages. The only thing keeping this place from being a 5-star establishment was that neither of our entrees really outshined the guacamole/margarita beginning to the meal, as well as some difficulty understanding my waiter.  He kind of mumbled a lot and wasn't very helpful describing the entrees.  However, I would definitely recommend the place and will probably make a return trip sometime in the future.",0.9914,0.795,0.162,0.044,0.5796296296296296

Our drinks were empty by this time as well. We ordered the guacamole which was very very salty and was not even plentiful to start off with. The presentation was poor as well with the majority of the guacamole shoved off to one side of the bowl.

One of us finally got up to retrieve utensils. Our waiter never returned to see how things were doing and no apology was ever offered for any of the above mentioned issues. Impatient, we just got up and told the manager that we wanted to just pay for our food and go because service was terrible.  The only reason that this review is 2 stars instead of 1 star is because the mojitos were comped and the manager apologized.

I realize we are in a Mexican restaurant, and it would make sense to assume that there may be a language barrier from time to time. But this man could not speak English to save his life. I can speak a little Spanish, so after a few mumblings from our server - who was trying, but just didn't have the knowledge - I told him it was ok to speak in Spanish. I realize it's really the location that sinks this place. They don't offer good Mexican food at reasonable prices because it's Wicker Park.

Service.  Once seated, the food and drink comes quickly.  The water is topped off.  The waiters and waitresses are available but not hovering.     Atmosphere.  It was all birthday parties the second time I went, which was annoying at the time, but it is definitely a fun and festive place to go with big groups.  The front room is probably better for smaller parties and I am sure that the patio is fantastico in the summer.  Very crowded, very active, very loud.  There is lots of quirky artwork and colorful decorations around the joint, if you enjoy that sort of thing. Booze.  The margaritas are definitely better than averaged and priced accordingly -- the premium jobbies will set you back at least $10 if I recall correctly.  They aren't lethal but are very good and creative.  I enjoyed some lime and cucumber concoction on my last trip.  They use very high quality tequilas.  It would be fun (and probably result in brain trauma) to go and get ripped at their little bar some time.   The blah: Guacamole.  I think it is overrated and expensive.  Comes in mild, medium, and spicy.  The medium is pretty spicy as far as I am concerned.  This is just my personal take as everyone else seems to like it.  I like guacamole but upscale Mexican places seem to be getting away with something charging you $9 for mashed up avocodo.  for And as far as it being expensive, I suppose everything at Las Palmas is a little on the pricy side for a casual Chicago resto.

Las Palmas is becoming one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.  If you can go on a weeknight or bear waiting with other hip yuppies in Wicker Park on a weekend, it's well worth the trouble.  Get the Molcajete.  (Evidently you can make reservations.  It would probably be a good idea.)",0.9981,0.786,0.191,0.023,0.48646913580246914

2007-01-25,5.0,"Coming from Iowa, my preconceived notions of Mexican food before I moved here consisted of the culinary likes of Carlos O'Kelly's and Taco Bell.  Stuff a tortilla with low grade ground beef and then smother it with red sauce and melted cheese.  This can then pass off as any of the following: enchilada, burrito, taco, chimichanga, gordita, tostada...if you're lucky you may get three seperate stuffed and smothered tortillas, all exactly the same.  This is referred to as a 'combo platter'.   So with that as my background, I must say, what a culinary delight Las Palmas is.  Warm, inviting and devoid of clapping, singing, Caucasian waitresses who are forced at gunpoint to put a cheesy sombrero on Little Billy's head and sing 'Happy Birthday' off key.   Despite it's seemingly generic name, Las Palmas scores huge points for originality and a creative menu.  It can be a bit pricey, especially if you are ordering 'ritas, but it is worth it.  We've been there at least half a dozen times and have never had a meal that was less then fantastic.   Their margaritas are great...strong and sweet, but not TOO sweet.  I'd rank them as the second best I've had in the city, right behind Topolobampo.  Go for value and order a pitcher of them, as it's a much better deal then ordering them individually. Gucamole is great too, though my one complaint is they got rid of the cheese queso dip, which was good enough to fist fight over.  Melted cheese on chips...mmmm!  You can take the boy out of Iowa, but you can't take the Iowa out of the boy... I'm a simple man with simple tastes.  Though they do have some enticing exotic choices, my money is placed squarely on the Tacos Compar.  Do not mistake these for Ortega in the box my friends.  These will have you standing up and doing a little cha cha dance tableside.   The front of the restaurant is dark and romantic...it screams class.  The back is a little more brightly lit and loud...it screams party.  Business in front, party in the back.  Just like my high school mullet.",0.995,0.773,0.18,0.047,0.45472789115646267

2006-05-30,5.0,"The food is incredible here!  The only way I can describe it is nouveau Mexican.  It's traditional but with an updated flair.  I have been here twice and had an unbelievable meal both times...as did my dining companions.   The staff is very nice, although I have two complaints.  (1)  It takes longer than it should to get a margarita.  (2)  I didn't know that there was an outside patio.  I had made reservations and when we arrived it was a beautiful night...perfect for sitting outside...but no one asked us if we would like to be seated on the patio.  We were halfway through our meal before we realized the patio was in the back.  It would have been nice to sit out there...they had mariachis playing too.   The food was so good that I still give them 4 stars even with my complaints.",0.957,0.772,0.166,0.062,0.6636363636363637
2006-04-28,5.0,"I've had two incredible meals here; one with a visiting friend and a boyfriend and the other with the same boyfriend. The menu is sprawling and both times it took me ages to decide on what to get. We did the tableside guacamole once. If you think that the guacamole is priced too high, think about the cost of buying all the ingredients and the time it takes to make it yourself. Splurge a little.  As for entrees, I can't remember what I had the first time, but the second time I had enchiladas in a mole sauce. They were delicious. I'd expect this from any mid-range expensive restaurant, but the presentation is elegant. The food is all made fresh and you can actually taste that. The drinks are large and a little pricey, but one raspberry margarita had me tipsy. I prefer Las Palmas as a date desination as opposed to a place to have dinner with friends. This place just screams romance though neither time I was there was there was a man singing. Maybe the third time's a charm, eh? UPDATE: Hey, look at that! Z and I went here tonight and there was totally a man singing. It was a beautiful day. We had guacamole. We split a half pitcher of strawberry daiquiris. Z got steak fajitas. I ordered La Pollita tonight and it blew my mind. Hands down, it was one of the best Mexican dishes I have ever tasted and it was so big I got to take some home. The crowd here was kind of annoying, but our waiter and busboy were amazing. UPDATE 2: The vegetarian El Churrito platter is mouth-wateringly amazing and also a huge amount of food.",0.9939,0.81,0.168,0.022,0.5224985302763081

It's not so noisy that you complain, but it's definitely bustling. I was pretty disappointed with the food. I thought my dish was pretty bland (my guests had similar thoughts).
