2017-06-14,5.0,"Dined on a lark before the U2 concert on Sunday, June 4th.  The place got packed, but the service was spot on under the enormous pressure.  We noticed that the table bus service worked well with the servers.  It was such a smooth operation despite being swamped.  Guess they've been through this many times? Anyway, on to the food....the entrees were excellent.   We wanted to eat a little lightly, so we both got fish.   I usually don't like to get salmon in restaurants (because nobody cooks it as good as me...ha ha !), but their description was so good, I had to try it.  Man...moist, cooked medium, and flavorful!  My wife got the sauteed monk fish, and it melted in your mouth!  The wines by the glass were very good, particularly the one from Puglia.  The pours are generous....somewhat rare these days.  We will definitely return for another turn at Gioco!",0.9739,0.808,0.16,0.032,0.6116666666666666
2017-06-05,3.0,"Atmosphere: They have a neat interior - kind of a fancy yet slightly rustic, countryside Italian feel, although I'll admit I've never been to Italy :) I think they could improve it a bit with some more lighting - it felt really dark in there for a sunny, summer day. I also thought it was kind of cool that they have an open area of the kitchen so you can kind of see what's going on. Food: The food is tasty and very flavorful but expectations and portions don't align with prices. We ordered two Moscow Mules ($12 each), and a Caprese salad ($10) to start. The Caprese salad was honestly 3-4 slices of fresh mozzarella, 3-4 slices of fresh tomato, fresh basil leaves, and olive oil. Definitely not worth the $10 - spend it on a different salad or appetizer instead. We bought a bottle of pinot noir ($44) and really enjoyed the wine during out meal and dessert. For entrees, both my fiance and I ordered from the specials menu. I had the filet risotto and he had the sea bass. My risotto was flavorful and filling but I was pretty disappointed when my dish arrived it was just little bits of filet mixed in with the risotto - certainly not worth $25 IMHO. I should have gone with the regular 8oz filet option from their regular menu at $30. His sea bass was very delicious - perfectly seasoned and prepared. Downside there was it was basically just the fish for $35 - it did sit on a (small) bed of spinach. We ordered the tiramisu ($10) for dessert and although it was very tasty, again, the portion size didn't align with the price. It literally came out in one of those ceramic cups used in diners for soup. Our bill was $160 without gratuity. Service: Although I would consider the service good, the servers/bus boys seemed so hurried every time they came to our table to deliver something or clear something. The food came out very fast - much to our surprise considering how busy they were that evening. Although the servers were in rush, my fiance and I were in no hurry, and certainly did not rush out of there just because people were belly up to the bar waiting for tables. The hurried service didn't impact our enjoyment of the meal. In summary: Although the food was overall very good, I am not in any hurry to return to this restaurant due to misalignment of portions and prices. I would probably go straight to the entrees here then do dessert and drinks somewhere else.",0.9947,0.812,0.151,0.037,0.4904945054945056

(It was a simple, easy walk for those coming from out of town and saying at or near the Hilton on South Michigan.  Our group shared a bunch of appetizers so I was able to sample a few different appetizers. Polpo all a Griglia - grilled baby octopus. Interesting. I have had grilled octopus before and it was about the same. In this dish the octopus was cut into smaller slices or chunks. Easier to eat. Polpettine - meatballs with grilled bread. I think this was probably my favorite savory item here in a tie with the burrata  Calamari fritti - fried calamari. Traditional. Crispy.  Charcuterie board - very nice presentation. In addition to the meats and cheeses it also had grapes and bread sticks. Unfortunately I didn't catch exactly what was on it, but I did have a bunch of it and it was what it should be.  We also had a burrata and cured meat dish that I do not know the name of.  I LOVE burrata and mozzarella so I finished this one off.  I was intrigued by a few dishes on the menu. They have hand made pastas with bolognese or pasta with braised duck, pizzas, and steak, but after running my short list past the server I finalized on his suggestion. For my main dish I ended up with the vitello alla Marsala. The veal was served on a bed of spinach and topped with a ton of mushrooms. The veal was good. Tender enough to cut with a fork. I liked the sauce as well. It was not a lot of meat, but tasty.  For dessert, I also was able to try a small assortment.

2016-07-02,1.0,"This place was woefully unprepared to handle the crowd headed to the Guns N' Roses show at Soldier Field.  I'm sure it a serviceable neighborhood restaurant, but the inability to predict there would be a crowd like this on a Friday night before a big concert and the failure to adapt to the situation leave me unimpressed.  The food was okay to above-average.  We had the bruschetta and it was average.  The margarita pizza was okay.  It was watery and the crust was too thick for the style of pizza they are going for.  The spinach tortellini was good, definitely above average.  Now for the fun part.  We made a reservation in advance and were seated relatively quickly.  The hostesses (yes two of them) were turning people away citing a one hour wait time, but they forgot to stop taking online reservations, so that compounded things.  After we got seated, we realized it was busy and we were patient, but it took 20 minutes to place our drink order (we went ahead and ordered everything at once realizing how this was headed).  This is where the multiple hostesses could do something to alleviate the backlog.  There was not a manager in sight and the restaurant was understaffed for servers given the crowd.  A little proactive management would have helped, but that didn't happen.  It was another 20 minutes to get our drinks and the wife's vodka gimlet turned out to be scotch (maybe) on ice.  Fine by me, but not by her.  We sent it back and got the same wrong drink 10 minutes later.  They did offer a complementary rose to her in the meantime, but we decided to cut our losses there.  We ate our food, got the check as quick as possible and got out of dodge.  It was a very unsatisfying dinner experience and not one we'll do again given the other choices we have for Italian in the city.",-0.1254,0.845,0.077,0.078,0.40053418803418805

The ambiance is great and even on a weeknight this place had a fair amount of people here too which speaks to the business they must keep getting.  All that said, I thought my food was just so so. I got their tortellini stuffed with spinach and a truffle fondue cream sauce which was good, but I think there could have been more of that truffle flavor that is the whole excitement when ordering a dish that has truffle in it, I say! Their caprese style starter also didn't see quite as flavorful as it could have been either, and their wine poached pear also fell a little short for me. But that creme brulee I actually very much enjoyed and their wine selections also were decently priced as well and we had a nice bottle of cabernet.

A little old timey decor but in the best sense. There's an open kitchen so you can watch the chef and there's a full bar so there's plenty of drink options. Onto the food: (1) We received bread (slightly charred for my liking) with extra virgin olive oil and grated Parmesan upon sitting down.  (2) The caprese salad was a fairly small portion and served on a ridiculously enormous plate. It was okay to taste, the mozzerella was a little dry and they served it only with olive oil, I prefer caprese with a touch of balsamic reduction. (3) The tortelloni was also a small portion but very rich. Don't be fooled, the menu says it has a touch of cream - it's a ton of cream. All in all, I found it a bit bland but my date thought it was delicious. (4) the tiramisu was by far the best dish of the night. It was served in a teacup with a sugar cookie and wow, it was fantastic! Finally, I should mention, the service was fantastic. The waiter was observant without being annoying and was able to answer questions on the menu. Our water glasses were always full and our food came out quickly. I gave 3 stars because overall I was a bit underwhelmed, but I would go back and try different dishes!",0.9938,0.811,0.177,0.012,0.6057239057239058

Not really sure why  they would insist on a credit card if the restaurant is Dead an a Saturday night valentines day at 7pm We started with appetizers. I saw a Burrata Dish on the menu for $15 and asked the Waited if there is an appetizer version.  He said yes and brought out a hunk of Burrata  with some heirloom tomatoes.  There not even enough tomatoes to go with the cheese so were literally eating the cheese by itself half the time.  The waiter failed to mention that this appetizer was $30! More than twice the cost of any appetizer on the menu and double the cost of the Burrata dish on the menu.  after a round of complaint after the bill came he did finally agree to adjust the price.. Still don't see why they are not upfront about the price. We also had to ask for bread 3 times because the bring out such small  portions of bread for the table it was almost embarrassing.  6 small pieces for 4 people with a burrata appetizer does not make sense. I then ordered the Chilean Sea Bass which was $35 market price which was ok.  But my wife and her friend ordered the tortellini which was awful, the both hated it and my friend had the linguini Bolognese which was average.

We wanted a simple caprese salad, but were upsold on a Burrata. Sounded yummy, goey cheese in a hard shell. It was good, but nothing fabulous. Plus we were not told it was over $30 dollars until we got our check- definitely not worth the price at all. 2.) My husband ordered a RACK of lamb. This 'rack' turned out to be two of the tiniest, measly chops - also $35. They did not look like one of the pictures featured here. What's going on Gioco?

It seems like they've gone out of the way to hire the greasiest, Jersey Shore-like waiters in the city. They also make them wear black T-shirts that they bought on the girls side of ZARA.  The whole place reminds me of the slimy greek waiter sketch from SNL (""You like the juice?"")

You want to turn the table over but this isn't Carrabba's. The chef/owner/whatever kept walking around talking to all of his ""friends"".

The chef came over to our table, I thought, to ask us what was wrong, and see what he could do.....not him...Gaitano is his name, by the way, came over to berate and intimidate me.....all 3 of us at the table were dumb struck. Never had any of us experienced anything like that. He told me it wasn't over cooked and that it was an expensive meal. Again, we were dumb struck. Finally my wife in her wisdom, said to the chef (who is also one of the owners) ""what do you want her (me) to do?"" His response was to walk away....... Our server was apologetic, and seemed a bit embarrassed....apparently, this is not unheard of behavior for Gaitano. The table next to us overheard the interchange, and thus begun a really fun conversation....which saved the night. They too were appalled at the so called chef's behavior.

What Phillip R. wrote in his review is EXACTLY what happened to us, except the chef never came out. If he had, I hate to think what I would have said to him.  They tell you about their ""specials"", but fail to mention the price of their ""specials"" are almost triple their regular dishes.  I'm use to fine dining and waiters always tell you the cost, but in this case I didn't think to ask. I assumed it was in the same price range as all their appetizers. WRONG.  The cheese appetizer was good, but it was $30. UNBELIEVABLE.  Then, our friend ordered the veal special and it was $55.  More than twice their entree prices.  I ordered the Penne Arrabiata and soon realized my friend ordered the same thing except my portion was 1 1/2 times hers - for the same entree.  AND there was no meat in it.  So, here's the recap.  Our bill came to $214 plus tip for 4 people - and only one of us had meat in their meal and only 2 of us ordered A DRINK.   The chef and his wait staff are CON ARTISTS in my book. The good was good, there's no denying, but not worth $214.   Oh, and our reservation was at 9 on a Saturday and the place was almost empty.  When we left at 10:30 we were the last ones there and we were rushed out because they were closed.  I now understand why this place was empty.  I got the feeling I was being conned by these people and I'm sure I'm not the only one.  And that's why we won't be going back.  We've had $200 meals before for just 2 of us, so the money wasn't the issue and the quality/ taste of the food wasn't the issue.  It was the con game of up-selling without being truthful about the prices.

2014-02-10,3.0,"This review is just for dessert, since the last time I had a meal here was a million years ago, when they first opened (and I was kind of drunk at the time). We lived just down the street from Gioco until a couple of months ago and tried to go there a couple of times but they close so damned early! We always wound up at Flo & Santos next door. Obviously, Gioco is fine dining and it is a lovely, intimate space. The problem, I think, is that it's dated. They're never crowded but I think they have old-time regulars. And maybe those regulars don't like to eat after 8:30 or so. I don't know. But we do. Anyway, we stopped in for dessert last night and everyone was nice, although it was obvious they were gunning to close. Our server was not at all excited to get a new table. I couldn't tell, but she had to be relieved that we were only ordering dessert. And about that dessert-- I got the trio of gelati. They said it was house made, which is normally a good thing. They said they had strawberry, which, to me, was a bonus. It came out and the consistency was good but...it didn't taste like strawberry. At all. At first I thought they must have used the same scooper for some other flavor, which was affecting this flavor. But no, this gelato, while pink, was decidedly NOT strawberry. To me, it tasted very coconutty, like suntan oil. My husband thought it was more like cinnamon. I didn't get that, but suffice to say, not strawberry. His tiramisu was good. And he said the espresso was fine. As for me, I was underwhelmed. We still live in the neighborhood, just not down the street anymore. I doubt we'll be back, although if someone wanted to go there and it was well before 8, I might consider trying an entree.",0.8117,0.808,0.102,0.09,0.46774410774410774

Our knowledgeable and warm server Juan, ably assisted us in paring our dishes with quality wines from the limited, though well-chosen selection avail by the glass, carafe, or bottle. One reviewer of the crab cake noted she'd had crab cakes all over the world and this was the best. I totally concur - And though not nearly as global in my crab cake journey I came up on the Jersey Shore, north of Blue Claw Central: The Chesapeake Bay. But enough about that -  it was only one part of an overall great meal. We also enjoyed the Polpettine - beef & veal meatballs with a light basil/tomato crema and garnished w/raisins. This was my first encounter with gold raisins as a garnish and would never have expected it to show up on this dish, but was glad it did. The light, flavorful crema highlighted by the punchy, tart raisin intrigued the palate just long enough before the the dish's main stars - these most savory of meatballs - took their turn.  For my entree, I went with the bolognese with a chunky, ground beef veal sauce that was right from the old country over fettuccine. Well-seasoned, perfectly proportioned and hearty enough for the coldest arctic blasts blowing off the Lake. Dessert was creme brulee topped with brandy-soaked cherries in a dark cherry reduction sauce.  I cannot wait to come back to Gioco.  What a wonderful dining experience.

2013-10-27,1.0,"What a terrible experience.  We made reservations at Gioco on Friday, 10/25.  Upon arrival the hostess asked to see any coupons or gift certificates we would be using (odd request we thought?!).  We showed her our two $50 gift certificates and she informed us we could only use one per visit.  Since we've never been any place that limits the amount of gift certificates you can use we scoured the gift certificates themselves for some indication to confirm what the lady was saying.  After finding no fine print stating this rule, we asked to speak to the manager.  When he arrived, I showed him the two gift certificates were consecutively numbered (they were bought by my wife's parents at the same time and given to us as a gift).  I also told him I've never heard of being able to use only one gift certificate at a time as they are the same as cash and there was no indication of there being a limit on the number you can use.  He quickly responded with ""that's the rule"" and ""you don't have to eat here"".  We stood there opened mouthed at the manager's disrespect and curtness.  Ultimately we decided to get take out (not wanting to spend any more time in the restaurant).  We never got resolution or an apology for the manager's attitude and now we're stuck with another gift certificate that we'll have to use. We live a block from Gioco and have been a few times.  We've never had the displeasure of meeting their management staff or knew their ridiculous policies.  Needless to say after we spend exactly $50 more dollars (our last gift certificate) there we will not be returning.  We have already thanked our parents for the generous gift but requested that they never get us gift certificates from Gioco again. The food is good.  The hostess and waiter apparently knew their manager was rude to most people and were extremely nice to us.  The price is high compared to the quality and portion you get.  All in all, there are much better Italian options around this big city.  For the same price you can get much better atmosphere, similar quality food, and a much much more pleasant management staff.",0.9844,0.836,0.124,0.04,0.5313978494623655

In addition to the funghi, we also ordered the prosciutto pizza, but it wasn't nearly as good.  Not as much cheese, and the arugula that was much too plentiful on top was too bitter in contrast to the rest of the flavors.  The pizzas comprised round 1 of our carb loading meal and were served up within 5 minutes of placing the order.  Those wood fire ovens don't waste any time! Round 2 included the fettucine bolognese, which tasted hearty, meaty, and was clearly made with love, and the oxtail orecchiette, which is a fancy term for ear-shaped pasta.  I loved the savory flavors, and this time, arugula worked in this dish. What's keeping this review from being 5 stars is the steep pricing on the pizza.  I didn't bat my eyelashes at the $18 price tag for the pasta dishes, but each pizza was $18 as well.  Regardless, I will definitely be back to try the tiramisu!",0.9587,0.804,0.133,0.063,0.4771604938271606

A ton of cheese is piled on a thin, crisp crust that is able to withstand the toppings. The pizza is brought out piping hot, straight from the oven.  The food is matched by the attentive and congenial staff. Although we arrived about 20 minutes before they closed, no one seemed to mind. The hostess acknowledged our presence as soon as we walked in and the bartender went out of his way to make us feel welcome.

Rather than bringing a bottle of olive oil and some fresh parmesan to the table, the bus boy poured a less than generous portion of oil on a plate, and only upon request bought a plastic cup of parm--not freshly grated I might add.

Originally it was one if my favorite restaurants in the city.  They have had so much turn over accompanied with weird unexplained brief closings recently.  The portions now are laughably small and the quality has declined.  That is a bad combination.  For example, a margarita pizza should have nice chunks of fresh mozzarella.  Gioco uses a low quality shredded cheese that emanates grease. A specialty cocktail can cost around 16 dollars.  A real shame since the space and decor are do incredible.  Even with that there are reasons the place drags relatively empty on Saturday nights.",-0.3818,0.8,0.085,0.115,0.5400000000000001

Anyway, our server was fantastic- friendly, prompt, responsive. The food was quite tasty, or at least mine was (gnocchi).  My friend had the ravioli and she was happy with it. However, my other friend had the risotto and it wasnt so good- it was very chewy and tasted pasty (a sign that it was not cooked enough). She nicely asked the waiter to just heat it up to cook it a bit more and he was cool about it- brought it back to the kitchen. Next thing you know, we have the chef coming to our table defending his risotto. Seriously? Im Italian as well, and I know risotto is al dente, but this was well under al dente-- the taste was off since it wasnt fully cooked. You could tell he was offended, and we continued to try to be nice about it, but I thought it was uncomfortable to have the chef come out and argue his point; just cook it a little more, that's all she wanted. Anyway, he eventually did and it was perfect.  The only other issue was with the serving size, not sure if they ran out of food but my gnocchi was barely 1/2c serving- very small. I dont need a large bowl of it, but it was extremely small...especially for $18.  All in all, I'd give it 2.5 stars.

Went to Gioco's after we felt that our hotel restaurant (Hilton) was bland, boring and overpriced. I don't regret it a single bit.  The service was very attentive, we even got to meet the chef who offered us a great grappa selection (Nonino's - try it if you are there!). We started with a great baby calamari salad appetizer which I believe was lightly fried, but very crisp and tasty. We had several glasses of grappa and graduated towards the wine list. We settled on a mid priced bottle that was delightful and went great with the excellent veal marsala with mushrooms.

We ordered an appetizer from the list of specials and were surprised as the check arrived that it was $27. What is this? Everest? Again, I don't mind paying this much for food but the price has to be justified. In this case, it wasn't Bottom line, the place suggests with it's prices that it is something, which it is not.

The service was good, and because it was only moderately busy one of the chefs came by to suggest that instead of the Branzino on the menu that I planned to have he would make me a whole fish. This turned out to be a very lucky break as it was perfectly done, crisp on the outside and delectably flaky and flavorful on the inside. My wife tasted it and couldn't believe it either. Alongside was fresh spinach sautéed in oil with pieces of garlic that was the best preparation of this favorite of mine I had ever eaten. My wife enjoyed her classic fettuccine bolognese, and the portion was too large for her to finish--I'm glad to say. Her asparagus appetizer was just so-so, but my Polpettine, one beef and one veal meatball with blonde raisins and a delicious red sauce infused with basel was outstanding. We shared the Affogato for desert, vanilla gelato with espresso poured over it, which was fine but not quite as interesting as we had hoped--or as good as the Tiramisu, which I had had in the past.

The menu has changed considerably and we noticed that the overall look and way of running things was seemed a bit...cheaper.  (No parmesan with the bread and oil, smaller portions, fake veggies in a wicker basket on a table nearby, fake bread hanging on the walls, etc..).  Thinking that maybe they were having an off night we went back over the weekend.  Boy were we right the first time around.  Here is a quick recap of our most recent trip... -Server was again not very knowledgeable.  She listed about 15 specials and by the time she was done describing them, we forgot half of them.  I was most interested in the fish special and m my husband knew it so he asked a bit more about the dish.  She didn't know anything else (i.e. consistency, flavor, etc.). She stated she personally hates fish so she takes the smallest bite possible when tasting it so she doesn't really know. Ok?  That doesn't help me any, especially when you're asking $25 for it. -Fake veggies and bread still hanging from the wall. -Both our meals were very salty.  I personally like salty, but it was even a bit much for me. -The ceasar salad.  This STILL makes me mad thinking about it.  They are very clearly trying to save some money.  The ceasar (which I always used to LOVE here) is now basically lettuce, with oil all over it and seasoned with salt and pepper and parmesan on it.  There is no ceasar dressing!  I said to my husband...maybe my tastes aren't sophisticated enough or something, but um...this isn't a ceasar salad!  There is no ceasar dressing!

2012-06-26,1.0,"This is event related if you are looking to book a party. Super disappointed!! The first time we came to Gioco we stumbled upon it because the restaurant we intended to try was too busy. We loved the atmosphere when we walked in and they were slow (most likely because of new competition). Food was just ok and fusion drinks need some help but we fell in love with the event space and thought it would be perfect for our small wedding of out-of-town guest.  Fast-forward a year -- time to plan the wedding dinner. I contacted the restaurant and received a general email from their info@ account. The menus looked good and the prices looked great so we attempted to make an appointment to see someone about locking it down. We chose a date on a Friday night in between Christmas and New Years and working in this industry for many years realized they will be lucky to have a few tables that night with the way the holidays fall. It took some back and forth with Sam the"" event person"" and I couldn't get her to commit to a date. After a few weeks I let her know my fiance was going to drive downtown and we would come by at 5:30-6:00 pm Friday night (which she said she is always there from 4:00-10:00 pm). We would see the space again, leave a deposit and get a contract. In our busy schedules we set aside this night (a rare Friday in the summer) and went down to the south loop. We arrived and the hostess told us she had just left. The first story was that she was cut early. The second story was an emergency came up. The hostess seemed slightly apologetic and let us know she would take us back to the event rooms since we were there. Being a Friday night we needed a drink so we sat at the bar and ordered. Mind you that they didn't offer to buy us a drink for taking the time to come in and being blown off. I asked the bartender with the tattoos if she knew how to make a spritz like the kind you get in Venice since on the menu they had a similar specialty drink and it is an Italian restaurant. She says sarcastically, which Venice?"" So now we have been blown off and ridiculed. I said, ""The one in Italy"" and then she proceeded to be sarcastic so I ordered something else which she decided to improvise from the menu (she added vanilla vodka to the cucumber cocktail) on a whim and it was awful! Not surprised though, the first time we were in there the special drinks were horrible -- steer clear of the special drinks!!! So after paying $60 for 4 drinks and a just ok pizza we asked if someone could show us the event space since no one came by to ask. We went on a short tour with the hostess who couldn't answer any of my questions and we decided to leave our deposit to secure the rooms. So $560 later we headed out with no contract and a really bad feeling. In the car I sent an email to the info@ account that Sam must use and said to please get back to us right away because we had left our deposit but still have a bunch of questions. I didn't get a reply back until Tuesday afternoon!!! She did apologize but when I emailed back and said we were having second thoughts about having the event there I didn't hear back from her and a week later after no response when we called her to cancel our deposit she just said, ""Ok. You will get an email of the credit."" Never asked why, just ok. If you are thinking on having an event there -- THINK AGAIN! If they were smart they would hire someone who wants business to make the restaurant money. It is a shame to waste that great space!",0.9892,0.812,0.118,0.07,0.41895103104780534

One of the packages you can bid on was a night stay at the Hampton majestic, Shakespeare theatre tickets, and $100 at gioco. So my mother was given this as a gift and since I have a nine month old my mom gave this to us and offered to watch our little one. when we sat down the very first thing I said is that I had a gift certificate. The waitress said without even looking at it ""we cant accept that"" then she stormed off to the front and argued loudly with a lady while this was going on the one lady sent over the hostess to ask if we were given menus yet. So finally our waitress comes back and tells us that we can use it and goes on to seriously offend us by going on about how people forge them and in no subtle way was saying she thought we had done just that. she asks if we would like drinks so I order a kiddie cocktail and my fiancé orders a captain and coke when she came back to bring them she told us the specials and we tell her were seeing a play and in a bit of a hurry so the chef comes up while we were ordering. Me: the special which was braised short ribs on top of mashed potato with truffle something and fiancé: tried to order the rib eye which she told him they were out of (on a Friday at 6 pm STRANGE) but he ordered the filet. The chef was very nice and took it upon himself to make sure our food was cooked immediately so we wouldn't miss our play even though the waitress told us when I expressed my concern about being late ""DON'T TRIP"" ok thanks for the advice! So then I asked her to see if they carried liquor 43 I like to use in a key lime pie martini with cream and lime juice. So she rolls her eyes and says "" we're not going to have cream there's not like we have half and half or anything!"" with the most exaggerated attitude oh really no half and half at a restaurant? You don't serve coffee? But I just ask her to check anyhow. So after a loooong wait she was standing talking to the many servers/bus boys etc near us so I ask her what happened and she tells me that she hasn't even asked the bartender because the bartender But then she goes on like I'm stupid to explain that the bartender knows what she's doing and can make me a drink so I just say u know what I'll just have an amaretto stone sour. She then says ""you know that gift certificate doesn't cover gratuity it might cover tax but not tip"" so I say ""no it doesn't cover either we know"" to which she replies that ""you don't get change on the certificate so we should use all $100 "" and walks away the food comes and then finally my drink. We eat relatively fast and then my fiancé orders another capt and coke  and I say ""I would really like creme brûlée"" and of course she replies "" really? U want the creme brûlée now?"" and I said yes instead of a drink I wanted dessert. So she asks "" do you want the check cause the manager..... Well she's not really the manager blah blah blah blah"" I tuned her out and Wil says yeah we want the check. So we get the check and it's only $15 because of the $100 so I lay down two twenties and wait 10 minutes for her to stroll back around (there is barely anyone inside the place) I tell her I need change so after a while she comes back with a twenty and a five!!! I say no I need change to tip you and she opens her little tip book thing and tells me she doesn't have change for a twenty. ARE YOU JOKING?? A waitress in a restaurant doesn't have change? Or that refuses to find change from anyone else? So she takes my five and twenty uses my five with a ten and some singles like here's $20 so I say ok where's my $5? Now she's basically throwing a temper tantrum and I say here give me the twenty and hand her all the rest back and say keep that cause I'm ready to flip to which she responds "" that means your only giving me $5 as a tip!"" I was so ready to get the heck out of there so I said here give me the $5 and hand her the twenty then we leave. Her $5 comment hit me when we were in the cab, and I hadn't intended on giving her $5 I was gonna give her $15 that's 10% and that's ten percent over what that woman deserves! She got a twenty off me by being sneaky and after we left the whole thing was clear she was so incredibly rude the entire time she made our dinner so unpleasant.  We had gotten stuck in traffic on the way there and to navy pier so in total we spent $40 at gioco and $40 on cabs I much rather would have gone anywhere.

2012-04-07,4.0,"On our last night of a fantastic week in Chicago my husband suggested we try Gioco which he had read some favorable reviews for on Yelp. When I finished picking myself off the floor from shock that he was organized for once I happily agreed. I love Italian food and the selection in Dublin is often sub-par so I was excited to see what Chicago had to offer. We caught the metro from our hotel in the north loop down towards the restaurant. When we disembarked I was a little nervous that the area immediately surrounding the station looked a bit dodgy and asked my husband where the hell he was taking me (don't judge me, I was a tourist, I don't know where is and isn't safe!). However I needn't have worried as a mere minutes walk around the corner you arrive into a leafy neighborhood with a selection of restaurants to choose from.  We didn't make a reservation as it was a Tuesday and we were seated promptly. The restaurant was busy but not overwhelming so. After a very long time perusing the menu (I wanted everything) we both went for the Tagliata Di Manzo (fillet beef with parmigiano, arugula and balsamic tar) with sides of broccoli rabe and fingerling potatoes. The beef was incredible, it cut like butter and was melt in the mouth. I haven't had a steak that good in a very long time. The cheese was sharp and the arugula was very fresh. The broccoli was a touch underdone for my tastes, I was chewing it for some time and my husband left most of his.  For dessert I went for the apple tatin which was just perfect, the caramel ice cream was delicious and creamy. I also had a cocktail which was bright green and it's name was something to do with an alligator. It definitely packed a punch but I'm Irish, that's good with me. The service was faultless, our server was prompt and very nice. I've a docked a star because I feel that sides should really be included with steaks, 8 dollars each was kind of expensive even though we were splashing out. It smacks just a touch of cheapness on behalf of the restaurant. Having said that, I'd come back if I was in Chicago again but I'd try the pasta next time.",0.9929,0.84,0.135,0.025,0.5542810457516341

2012-04-03,1.0,"I am very sorry to have to write this review. My wife and I have enjoyed more than a few meals at Gioco, and have always found the ambiance to be very pleasant, the service excellent, and the food absolutely first-rate. This evening, unfortunately, was quite different. So different that we will NEVER RETURN. We sat down at a quiet table and were greeted by the typically attentive and professional servers. As we sipped on some excellent Barbera, we placed our order--minestrone (her) and a salad (me) for our appetizers, followed by a Margherita pizza (our primo) and two branzini (as our secondi). No sooner did the generous portion of soup and salad arrive than my petite wife realized she ordered a bit too much. She decided to cancel her branzino and we immediately called our waiter to let him know. To our surprise, the waiter returned while we were still working on our appetizers and told us that the chef had already placed the branzini in the oven and that we could not cancel. He told us we could cancel the pizza which had not yet been put in the oven! Frankly, we were shocked at this response. My wife, very much looking forward to the pizza, and confused and distressed at the possibility of having to waste a delicious fish dish she knew she couldn't eat, went to see the hostess to explain the situation. The hostess said that this sounded strange.  Yet, a few seconds after my wife returned to assure me that there must have been a miscommunication, the chef (and possibly the owner?) came to our table to tell us we had no choice but to accept both branzini entrees. He curtly offered to wrap up a $29-entree for us to ""take home."" As I expressed my frustration in exasperation but maintaining a civil tone, the chef who himself came to tell his patrons, ""tough luck,"" asked me if I wouldn't mind lowering my voice. He was clearly concerned that other patrons would overhear my complaint. I couldn't have been more insulted. When I pointed out the absurdity of the moment--that my wife and I could quit right then and there, thus leaving him with two branzini entrees in the oven--he replied: ""That's your choice.""  So that's what we did.  The lesson here about Gioco is that the food is delicious and the service usually superb. Whatever you do, however, please heed this warning: DON'T MAKE A MISTAKE WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER!! Even if you attempt to correct it within minutes, you may be subject to the supremely unprofessional treatment my wife and I received this evening.",0.8421,0.81,0.098,0.092,0.5876647426647426

Fast forward a few months we decided to take our parents here on a Saturday night. I was impressed with them accommodating our large group. Everyone seemed impressed with the mushroom display and presentation from the chef himself! Once our dishes arrived a few plates were a bit off. For starters my dad's steak was far too pink to be medium so he sent it back. No biggie, it happens at times. However, my boyfriend's father ordered a pasta dish with sauce and it came soaked in a creamy sauce. He politely asked to have the dish with less sauce. What the kitchen did was merely dump some of it out of the plate. After taking a second look the dish was still covered in a cream sauce. He was not feeling it anymore and politely asked for the pasta dish with marinara sauce instead, a sauce a few of us had at the table. The waiter brought the plate back with an almost creamy marinara. So it appeared that the kitchen did was throw marinara ON TOP of the cream sauce. He's a smart man and this maneuver did not go unnoticed. He then told the waiter there was certainly cream in the sauce and in moments the chef stormed over to our table. Like any good restaurant in the city, we assumed the chef was coming over to apologize and recommend something else. But instead he raised his voice and yelled at our table for not being satisfied with the creamy marinara dish. We were all shocked and appalled.

Before I start with the food, I will say that I really enjoy Gioco's wonderfully, cozy atmosphere and that it's BYOB.   Now for the food... the best part of the meal was the grilled calamari appetizer. Nicely portioned, fresh and great spices/flavors. The worst part was the caprese salad. For an Italian restaurant, they should have hit this one out of the park... sadly, it was a definite foul ball. The tomotatoes were tasteless, pale colored and minimal (the dish might have included half of a tomato at most) and there was only 1 basil leaf on the entire plate! Not my kind of caprese salad. The salmon dish was ok, but they were a bit heavy handed with the sauce. The white fish left much to be desired. The texture was mushy and the seasoning was bland. Also, the service was very slow and our server was clearly inexperienced and not very knowledgable about the menu items (she needed to run back to the kitchen each time we asked a question).  The fabulous atmosphere definitely helped to offset the mediocre meal.

More importantly, I indulged in one of my favorite foods, a big veal chop, and found it exceptional.  Acccompanied by a perfectly dressed mound of arugula.  At $35 not inexpensive, but pretty typical number for such a high-quality piece of meat.  Nicely crusty in parts of the outside, and very rare the way I like near the bone.  Added a caponata side- small chunks of eggplant with other vegetables- I suppose an Italian equivalent of ratatouille, but crisper and somewhat more vinegary.  I love eggplant in any incarnation, but this was very well-executed. My friend tried the branzino (apparently a Mediterranean sea bass).  Grilled, skin up, it was served over fairly rich mashed potatoes and a flavorful vegetable sauce that may have even had a meat component to its flavor.  It was attractively arranged and delicious, with slivered crisped leeks on top.  I suppose the portion could have been a bit larger, but it was deceptively filling and outstanding. The juxtaposition of the slightly raw brick, masonry, steel and loft-like details against the dark red velvet keep it urban cool instead of falling back into bordello cliche.  Not sure why it's BYOB and whether that's the long-term intention, but I always appreciate the potential savings.

The appetizer of grilled calamari was excellent.  The calamari was unsliced, and it was accompanied by the cold lettuce, tomato, capers, olives, and EVOO, among other things.  My main course was the veal chop.  Just superb is all I can say.  My buddy had the rack of lamb, which also was top notch.  I finished it off with the chocolate cake, which had gelato, hazelnuts, and caramel sauce.  I've had a million chocolate cakes before, and this one certainly ranks up there among the better ones.

I loved the the place and cozy, warm and inviting by its rich colors and posh seating. But it was too smoky in their for my liking, so I choose to sit outside. Outside was nice too. While a few have said this the patio is noisy, I thought it was ok and the couple around me did not seem to mind at all about the train. I did not notice the train until I start reading the Yelp reviews at the table LOL! While the wait short hand staff was great with refilling water and bread, the waiter was not that great. It appears to me the older couple was of major importance to him. They were treated like Gods while I waited at least 5-8 minutes to order after I sat down. He only had four table to wait on at the time and two of the table were into their dinner already, so I was confused.  Like a few of the reviews here, I did feel ignored by him a few times.   For dinner, I just got the ravioli cheese plate; which was slim. I mean, there were about 8-10 pieces on my plate which were not that big and not stuffed as I usually find them to be at my favorite Italian restaurants. The taste was ok, but I was done with the plate in 3 minutes, tops. I wanted more, and should have gotten more for a  $16+ plate with nothing else served with it. For dessert I had the Panna Cotta which was light, but ok. It tasted alright, but I could have done without it. Overall, I found myself hungry about the time I got home, which is new for me. I felt like I did not even eat out. Bummer. You are just ok, but nope, I will not be back at Gioco's on my own dime. But I will eat if my company comes for dinner.

2011-06-07,3.0,"3.5 stars  I've always had good meals at Gioco and it's one of my favorite Italian restaurants in town. It's been a very long time since we've been here and armed with the Kleiner gift certificate we had dinner here last weekend.  Gioco has a huge space and it's interestingly decorated like the other JLK restaurants. The patio was open along Wabash, but we sat inside near the window. We were early dining with the blue hairs.  We got a few starters to split and enjoy with our bottle of wine. The grilled calamari and the cucumber salad were our selections. Of the two, we enjoyed the salad more. That surprised me. It was good and light with the cucumbers mixed with tomatoes in a light vinaigrette. The calamari were wood grilled and had a nice smokiness to them, but probably could have cooked a bit longer. I liked it and prefer it grilled to the stock fried preparation.  Now when it comes to entrees at many Italian joints, you can easily go astray. I always stick with pastas, which are always reliable. When you opt for a cut or a special entree, you run the risk of being disappointed and dropping twice what you would for a pasta or pizza. There were many pastas that tempted me and I ended up getting the Papperdelle al Ragu di Cinghiale-Wide Ribbon Pasta, Red Wine Braised Wild Boar & Pine Nuts. It was perfectly done and very tasty. My wife got the grilled swordfish, which she felt was too salty. We added a disappointing side of rapini to our mains. Coffee followed for us to get us through our night at the theatre. For dessert we had a vanilla and pecan gelatto and pear and mango sorbetto. The gelatto was the best of the three.  We had a solid meal and they got us to our show with time to spare, but we've had far better meals at Gioco in the past. I wish Kris had gotten a pizza because those are fantastic here and I no doubt could have snagged a slice. I always warn my wife about her choices in these kind of places.

2011-05-26,2.0,"I think this is my first 2 star. Not for circuses but more for experience. Gioco's is a nice establishment and kind of edgy. It is in a bustling area of the South Loop that many moons ago, was part of the whole speakeasies and ill repute known to mankind, but that is the gift of the area and to think that businesses are starting to bustle is really a good thing. Also other prohibition-era establishments including Al Capone's headquarters was once housed here. I was invited by my dear friend Jeanette for dinner (who happened to of purchased dinner tickets on SWOOP, its like Groupon). So we have been planning to use the certificate for some time and we decided this would be a nice time to try them out.  First off, we arrived at 5:06 PM and the server at the register said: ""Oh we don't open till 5"". Ummmm its after 5 PM! So wrong start to a planned out evening. Then we were seated near the window and that was what we wanted. Menu was given, and we conversed for a while, had water and bread with Olive Oil, then we ordered.  We both decided to get Rigatoni with meat and peas. Why not, it seemed like a semi interesting dish, and after all this place is Italian. So the pasta comes in a large plate, although the pasta is enough for one, the portions are small in size for the price, but I digress (for now). Also we a wanted a pinot Noir from the menu, but they didn't have any, instead we opted for something similar, but it was burned. Meaning that at one point, I believe this was chilled and put back on shelf, something I can tell right off the bat. The glass also was smudged, telling me that the dishwasher must be on the blinks or the dishwasher is letting glasses go by. But this was nothing I could not wipe down.  The pasta came to the table, and I guess I was spoiled by Francesca's in Little Italy, This paste was weak, texture was okay but the sauce (weak) had little if no taste. I think I must have put quite a bit of pepper to help, but alas, it was DOA. I felt bad since I really was looking forward to this day, and to think the best part of the meal was my visit with my friend and as always our conversations are really deep. But going back to the taste, WHAT TASTE!  Well the end of the evening was drawing near and my friend gave her Swoop coupon, the waiter took it and it was all good. But then my friend asked a question in regards to finding out which of her coupons was used before (she purchased 4) and the Manager came out really unprofessionally and said very stern, ""We will no longer be using your coupons at this establishment"". We were perplexed by this. He stated due to new owners, no more coupons will ever be honored again, and when she asked about how would she be refunded, he stated: ""That is not my problem it is between you and the coupon, but do not bring coupons here again. We will not honor them.  I was appalled, embarrassed and just mortified that this could be happening. Of course, I am calling their corporation to let them know about this establishments rudeness. Not so much the fact that he stated we could no longer use the coupons, but how stern he was at our table and how rude and inconsiderate he was. He could of said this in a better tone, but to literally be rude at our table, was unacceptable. Not impressed at all with the food or the wine. But the fact that a Manager could speak to customers in this tone, was not acceptable. So not worth it.",0.9228,0.791,0.111,0.098,0.5037461449226156

I did really like the ravioli di funghi, although Follia, which has since closed, made far better pasta (but suffered from a horrible location). I can actually deal with average Italian food, but what gets me about Gioco are the prices. Simply put, an $11 caprese salad better knock my socks off. We easily spent over $150 on dinner for two and it just wasn't worth it. The outside dining sounds nice, but it can actually pretty loud on Wabash, especially with the El thundering overhead.

It was an excellent combo of all the things I would have ordered normally, including my new favorite thing in the world - burrata. The bread was also really great. I had a beer and BF had an iced tea, and when we were finishing the antipasto waiter came by to see if BF wanted another iced tea, and rushed off as I yelled out to him to get me another beer (as my glass had been empty for a while). He didn't hear me, so another 10 minutes went by with an empty glass. Sigh. We split a pizza w/prosciutto and arugula. It was pretty good...really great crust, cheese and sauce, but the arugula seemed like it hadn't been washed...like it was really dry and limp. I didn't want to look too closely, but it almost looked like it had a little dirt on it. WASH YOUR VEGGIES, people! You really can tell when lettuce or other greens have not been washed, and it is my pet peeve. Anyway, I wanted to give them another chance after the re-opening since my previous visit was really not good at all (gnocchi so mushy that it was like runny mashed potatoes....and BF's steak was really tough).  Other previous visits have been better experiences.

2010-10-01,3.0,"Gioco is a business casual Italian Eatery in what was once a Speak-Easy.  Ultimately many reviews for this place are dead on that the service earns two stars while the food is close to four stars; read on for all the juicy details. My girlfriend and I stopped in for lunch looking forward to checking out someplace new, and of course to use the groupon that expires in a month.  I'm going to start with service first so I can end on a more positive note.  Our server looked unenthusiastic from the time we sat down to the time we left.  While she wasn't mean or unpleasant, she was wholly absent; she about walked away from the table after my girlfriend ordered barely remembering I hadn't.  When my girlfriend's wine glass was empty she looked right at it and didn't ask if she'd like another or anything else.  This is a clear sign she assumed we weren't good tippers.  In her defense the website said casual dress and we were dressed casually as opposed to the business casual that others in the place wore; in our defense that shouldn't matter!  The bartender/host seemed to be in a sullen mood as well.  When there are this many reviews saying the same thing you would think management would intervene, unless of course management is the problem.  More than one staff member this sullen is often the product of a staff upset with management.   My second peeve was the bathroom.  It was so nice on first glance; rustic, open, and clean.  There was only one blaring problem.  In a male bathroom a urinal should never be right next to a sink without some sort of separation.  Really urinals should be as far as possible from sinks but to be right next to a sink without a separation is just unsanitary and unacceptable. The food was far better than the rest of the restaurant and the only thing bringing their score up.  The prix fixe lunch is a great deal at $14.95.  The Caesar Salad was very nicely balanced between a dressing that wasn't too heavy and parmesan shavings.  The table side cracked pepper was a nice touch also.  The Prosciutto e Mozzarella Panini was good but mildly displeasing.  The bread was textured more like stale crunchy than Panini baked.  The saltiness of the Prosciutto, which is one of my favorite meats, wasn't as well balanced against the pesto as it could have been.  It was enjoyable and I liked it but it could have been less salty and oily by being better balanced and on better bread.  Now the Gnocchi di Blu was absolutely fantastic.  The Gnocchi was wonderfully light but full textured with a very pleasant typical potato gnocchi flavor.  It was mixed with a pulled oxtail that was braised in what tasted of tomato soup and beef stock and was as tender as one could possibly ask for.  The small chocolate cake was a bit subpar.  It was tasty but clearly reheated in a microwave as it was unevenly heated.  I would expect more from a place like this.  The Crème Brulee was on par with the Gnocchi that it was excellent.  The texture was perfect, the vanilla rich, and the brulee top a thick crunch of perfectly broiled on sugar. All-in-all we're looking at a 2 stars for service and 3.75 for food; this restaurant could easily be four stars with a few touch ups to the food and some service staff readjustment.  You'll notice from the rest of my reviews I don't really rate over 4 stars either, as that should be reserved for Michelin type restaurants.  It wasn't enough, service primarily, to bring me back across town.

Some people stated that they felt their service was lackluster due to their groupon.  However, before I even presented my groupon today, we waited for 10 minutes to be greeted by our server in a completely empty restaurant.  This would annoy me under any circumstance but is always infuriating when I am dining with my toddler, as there is a time limit associated with our meal.  No highchair was offered when we sat down.  Our server offered no details about the menu or specials.  After we finished our meal, we waited another 15 minutes for our check.  He arrived from behind a curtain and stated he would take the payment when I was ready.  No....""is there anything else we can get you?"" or ""how was your meal?"" or ""hope you enjoy the rest of your day.""  I left the payment on the table, as he was stooped over at the bar looking at something.  He did not say good bye, but we were wished a nice day by the hostess.  The hostess, along with the bussers were all efficient and did a great job. The funny thing is that when I dined here last year with a group from work (generating a bill over five hundred dollars), the service was the same.  It was a crowded evening, but there were long waits for ordering, no offer to refill wine or cocktails when empty, and no concern about whether we had all that we wanted or needed.   I think this is a lovely restaurant, with fun decor, a great location, and good food.  However, I think management needs to look into better training of the waitstaff.",0.9916,0.759,0.164,0.077,0.5096296296296295

I used to come here quite frequently and loved the place for dinner.  I had purchased a few Groupons and noticed that the service had changed.  On two different occassions it took forever to ordering drinks, getting more bread, ordering our entrees, getting the bill (and getting it fixed with the groupon).  Our waitress never came to see how things were during the meal.  I still generally like the food -  but the other dishes have not been as consistent.   My boyfriend tried a Risotto special and did not like it (which very rarely happens).  After the latest average dining experience, we're not jumping to come back for dinner. However, brunch makes it 3.5.  There were only a few other tables as this seems to be a secret spot. No wait! This is very important when starving.  Second, fluffy pancakes that are perfect after that late night out.  Third, took a bite out of their eggs benedict w/ pancetta and it was tasty (however, too much garlic in the potatoes).  Forth, good bacon.

Bland with nothing spectacular..neither the spices, the way it was cooked, nor  the prosciutto and provolone topping (wasn't even melted properly)...It was supposed to be rubbed in sage and then lightly breaded...the spinach side was too overpowered with the cloves of garlic and the entree was such a let-down. At $27, it's reasonable that one would expect outstanding flavor and presentation, no? The wine was a hit though....Brooks Amycas. I highly recommend to anyone who likes smooth, complex, light varietal, comparable to the wines of Alsace region of eastern France. I LOVED this wine from Oregon ($12/glass.... in Portland's finest restaurants, a glass only costs $8-9). The dessert was so much better than the main, I must say.

I bought a Groupon a few months back, intending for Gioco to redeem itself on the return visit. It did not. Our entrees suffered from the same mistakes as the first time around: Plagued by a complete lack of seasoning. When I visit an upscale Italian eatery and pay $15 for a plate of pasta, I expect strong, bold flavors that are surprising or at least memorable. Not the case for anything I've tried. I went with the wild boar entree this time. It may as well have been reheated beef stroganoff. The sauce was a thick, heavy gravy with no discernible flavor. Husband got the gnocchi but substituted the house red sauce to avoid meat. The dish just didn't work. The gnoochi were soft and chewy but again, the flavor was nonexistent.  I will say that the argula salad and crab cake appetizers we tried were great. No complaints, I really liked them. But I will never go to a place just for these ancillary items. Also, as with the entrees, they were way over priced. Especially the crab cakes - laughably small portions for the $10+ price tag.  Wish I loved it, but I just don't. I feel like this place is just skating by on its former buzz and not making effort to be fresh or inventive. Sorry, Gioco. You blew it.",0.9526,0.79,0.132,0.079,0.46666666666666673

We shared one bottle of wine (40 bucks was on the very low end of the price spectrum), one appetizer, two pasta entrees and the bill was 100 bucks before tip. Really? Calamari fritti was pretty good for an appetizer.  I had wild mushroom ravioli for an entree.  I LOVE mushrooms and unfortunately, they did not use just the mushroom caps but also used the stems.  Wild mushroom stems are woody and not really good for eating.  So every few bites I'd get a hard, chewy piece and it really ruins the whole experience.  My husband got the tagliatelle with boar (maybe it was ox? Menu had all weird meats). it tasted like beef stroganoff out of a box.

I then orderd the parma proscuitto thinking it would be delicious, thin, light and salty like they do it in Parma Italy.  Essentially what came out was thin-deli cut ham, did not even taste like proscuitto, very disappointed.  We both took one small bite and did not even finsih it. My boyfriend had the risotto special with italian sausage and gorgonzola, the risotto was undercooked and the sausage uninspiring.  I had the margherita pizza which was pretty good.  This place would be better off just serving pizza and wine. , Pretty overpriced for not so good food too.

My experience was ruined when my purse was stolen right out from under my feet (literally). I was siting in the back room at one of the large round tables with my purse at my feet. I avoided hanging it on the back of my chair to prevent this very thing from happening. The meal was nice, as stated above, and I checked my purse after dessert to check the time on my phone. Within a matter of seconds my purse, with my wallet, phone, etc., was gone. I was seated at my chair the entire time (as were the five other people I was dining with) and didn't notice any suspicious activity around me.  I alerted the staff to the fact that my purse was missing and their response was rather passive and disappointing. They had an attitude of disbelief and aside from a very cursory check around the premises, and use of the house phone to call the police, they really didn't do anything to mitigate the situation. Meanwhile my credit cards were being used at area gas stations (as later revealed on my fraud report).  THIS POST IS A WARNING to all future patrons.

Bonus--I can always find street parking if I drive.  I so want to LOVE Gioco, but right now, I think Gioco's just okay. The Carpaccio alla Harry's Bar was pretty good--it's Carpaccio of Beef, Capers, Mustard Aioli, Arugula, Radicchio, & Parmigiano--but the mustard aioli was more like mayo. It's a little off-putting on an otherwise tasty dish. I once had the Cappesante, which is pan roasted sea scallops. I cannot recommend because when I bit into one, something crunched. Maybe a shell or something? I don't know but when I had a second bit and it happened again, it was all over for me. Other trips have yielded much better results. The Filetto Con Salsa Al Barolo is a giant serving of fillet encrusted in Gorgonzola. This is good for the first three bites and then you'll probably want to scrape off the cheese. The other steaks are way too big for me. How about a smaller fillet for the ladies, Gioco, minus the cheese and barolo sauce, whatever that is?  During my most recent trip I ordered the Pesce Bianco, which is the pan roasted whitefish. Which happens to be served SKIN ON. Um, ew! I know, I know...keeping the skin on preserves the juices, yada yada yada. Okay then just take it off when done preparing, please. That way I don't have to scrape off the skin myself. This was just okay.  My dining companion, much wiser than me, listened to the waiter and ordered the Pollo Arrosto con Erba Secco--oven roasted chicken with dried oregano. She would not trade entrees with me unfortunately. This dish was the bee's knees. I mean it was delish! It gives me hope that on a FOURTH visit I will have a much better dining experience.

2010-05-09,3.0,"We live a few blocks from Gioco--easy walking distance-- so end up eating here more often than we would if we lived driving distance.  In fact, I'm not sure how often we'd eat here if it were less convenient.   The decor is typical  trendy--exposed brick walls, high ceilings with all the mechanicals exposed, very loud background noise.  You also run the risk of being seating along the railing, which means that another party is either directly above or below you.  I've wondered why they don't stagger those tables, like theater seats.  Probably they can cram more in this way.  You can also get stuck next to the open kitchen, which is either interesting or annoying depending on your take. Service:  Spotty.  We've had attentive, friendly waitstaff like the girl we had last night.  We've also had snotty, supercilious waiters.  The hostesses and hosts are generally bored and sometimes act annoyed that they have to seat you.  The manager should definitely train them better. Food:  Strangely, though this is an Italian joint, most of the pasta is unremarkable.  Last night my husband got some sort of spaghetti with shrimp & olives and said that he's had better sauce out of a jar.  What we usually end up getting is the filet mignon; it is served as two 4-oz pieces of meat --they split it for you--with accoutrements, and with a salad is easily enough for two.  It's very high quality meat and is grilled beautifully.  Maybe 20 years ago we'd still be hungry, but now it's perfect, which is a good thing because it costs $33 as of last night.  I can also vouch for the roast chicken ($19), served with interesting mushrooms, potatoes and some sort of horsradish sauce which was very good.  Drinks are good, we usually don't get dessert.   Some people have complained about a wait, even with reservations, but we've always been seated promptly, probably because we tend to eat early.  For people who eat later, the restaurant is sometimes stuck with people who sit at their table far longer than they should, talking, drinking, etc.  They can't very well ask them to leave, which means that you have to wait.  It's not the restaurant's fault.",0.9695,0.835,0.106,0.06,0.4901757105943153

First off the place is pretty cool inside. Kind of a two tiered layout with a hip vintage feel to it. Bottles of wine all over the room and a neat open kitchen that makes you feel like part of the action but also makes sitting too close to the kitchen a little warmer than I find comfortable.

I like.... walking in and always getting a table.  the brick walls and the comfortable feeling at the restaurant - not stuffy at all and fun to people watch.  getting soft fresh bread and olive oil when I get there (I also ask for Parmesan cheese). reasonably priced and tasty food. good service and a constantly filled water glass. The only thing that bothers me is that many of the wine choices I like only come by the ""pricey"" bottle, so that is a downer.

Angie: It's not the company.  It's this snoozer of a meal that has me fighting off sleep right now. And so it goes.  Dinner at Gioco?  Boring.  Uninspired.  Not exciting. My dinner entrée was the Pesce Bianco, which is pan roasted Lake Superior Whitefish served with fava beans, diced Roma tomatoes, garlic, red onion and finished with pancetta & saffron vinaigrette?  Yes, yes, I know that ordering roasted whitefish is not going to be a culinary masterpiece, but can't the fish at least have some flavor?  And maybe the beans could be something other than mushy?  This meal seriously lacked in seasoning and presentation (no color, no pop) and was just an all out disappointment. Our service was less that awesome, too.  I'm NEVER one to bitch about service, especially since I waited tables for years and I know that the job is hard and can be overwhelming, but our server was lacking in every way.  He seemed bored, unenthusiastic and uninterested in making our dining experience great.  I would expect that service would be a bit tighter at a restaurant where meals are in the $20 range. I don't know if it's because it was fairly early on a Tuesday night, but the clientele was not too rockin' at Gioco.  I wouldn't categorize this place as a see and be seen kinda joint. On the plus side?  I love the restaurant space.  It's old-world Italian from the wood floors to the iron accents on the furniture to the simple accessories and accents throughout the place.  I wouldn't expect anything less from a Kleiner restaurant, especially with the amazing work they've done decorating Carnivale, Marche and Vivo, to name a few.

However, I did really enjoy a lot of the appetizers, including the pizza with sausage and mozzarella (very good) and the mussels, as well as some of the other entrees the people I was eating with got (spaghetti with octopus, spinach ravioli). The service was exceptional; the food came out pretty fast and our plates were always cleared fast as well.

It definitely was on par with the rest of the Jerry Kleiner restaurants, but it is one of the top ones for me. The waitress was very nice and even informed us that they were doing a January special of a salad and entree deal for $20! We would have totally done that had we not had the Groupon. (So if you don't have a coupon, you should totally take advantage of this awesome deal!) We started with the beef carpaccio. I don't usually order this dish, but maybe now should! The beef was the perfect thin-ness and came with arugula, capers and a mayo sauce. Delicious! For my entree I ordered the scallops. (Of course! My favorite) I would say my entree was good but not great. The scallops were cooked well in broth, with baby spinach and mushrooms. But overall the dish was a tad salty and the scallops were a little sandy. They weren't the worst scallops I have had but also, obviously, weren't the best. My boyfriend opted with a pasta dish... one that was recommended by the waitress. It was a thick flat noodle pasta with wild boar. It was excellent! I was skeptical of the wild boar at first, thinking it was gamey or tough, but it was like pot roast and had a great flavor! The noodles were great, too, with a homemade consistency. It was totally a comfort food and the portion was huge! For dessert we got the trio of gelatos/sorbets. I love that I could choose from six different flavors. We chose the cactus pear sorbet (never had cactus pear and wasn't a fan), the pistachio gelato (yummy) and the butter pecan gelato (super yummy with huge chunks of pecan.)

And by the way, the substituted dish was gross - overcooked mushrooms, slimy ravioli, and way too much salt (as usual at Gioco).

The food - nothing to celebrate.  I had the Garganelli con Prosciutto -  penne with a cream sauce sporting mushrooms, prosciutto, and peas.  The plate cost $17, the prosciutto was tough, and the peas were obviously frozen.  The party shared an order of fried calamari, which was excellent, if a rather small portion for $10, and after the meal I had the cheesecake, which was presented well and had great taste & texture.  The Chantilly cream sauce that came with it was yummy, too. It seemed like a nice place to go on a date, but nothing about the experience would make me want to return, especially when there are so many other Italian places in town.  If I would have been the one paying, I might not have been as content with the meal that was served to me - I've had much better for the amount of money that was spent.",0.9911,0.778,0.186,0.036,0.5002777777777777

The food is not very good, the service is usually bad, and the price considering the bad food quality and poor service is too high.  The last time I was there (12/12/09) it was only because I was forced to go since a friend decided to have her b-day dinner there (not because I am a glutton for punishment). Let me start off by saying that they are not very accommodating for large groups. We had a group of 8 women. Secondly,  waiter was unbelievably rude (probably intentionally since we were a large enough group to have gratuity automatically added to the bill). I also think that he was annoyed that we didn't order more than one bottle of wine since some members of our party were not drinkers. Thirdly, the lights were turned off on us. Yes, they turned the lights off basically to let us know we needed to leave, but how could we leave, our incompetent waiter had not brought us our bill!! The worst part of that was that  the staff pretended like it was an accident but it wasn't because in my friend's quest to find the ladies room, she overheard two staff members stating ""I wonder if the ladies liked sitting in the dark."" Again, we were only still there because our bill wasn't brought out to us and our waiter was no where to be found. I don't like to complain, I normally would let this go (I let it go the previous 3 times I had been disappointed), but when it was made clear that the staff's rude behavior was malicious, I feel obligated to let the world know about how disappointing our experience was.

2009-10-27,1.0,"I cannot remember when I have had a worse experience at a restaurant. I generally am extremely happy with my experience at KDK restaurants; I love Marche, Red Light, and Opera, but I have been consistently underwhelmed by Gioco and my most recent experience was icing on the cake.  First, the waiter intentionally misrepresented the prix fixe menu. The advertised menu was for a five course meal including a mortadella course, a pumpkin pistachio soup, a LAMB ravioli, a striped bass, and a date desert. We received ""everything"" except the Lamb Ravioli.  It is impossible to concisely describe how the server misrepresented the menu to us, but please feel free to send me a message and I will be more than happy to accurately describe his ""tactics."" In short, he made it seem that since he ran through the revised menu quickly at the beginning of the ""meal"" that he was free to deliver anything that he felt like to the table. Second, our server did not see it fit to deliver anything to the table except our drinks. I know that servers are often not responsible for actually taking food to a table in a decent restaurant, but he did not even describe the food to us, ask us how it was, or show any interest in it, until we complained about being served a course not on the menu. Third, while our server did disclaim to us that the menu was different from what was advertised, we thought that he misspoke and did not think anything of it. The table next to us told us that the CORRECT course was significantly better than the course we were served. (Despite our server's representation that the dish we were served was ""significantly more expensive than the intended course."" I don't know about you, but I would much rather have the better dish than the more expensive dish, and I would always rather have lamb than  shiitake mushrooms; I still have the shiitake taste on my mouth and I left the restaurant over an hour ago.) Fourth, all of the food was incredibly salty (except the ""pumpkin"" soup which tasted like watered down cream with crushed pistachio on top) and I just got the impression that at every corner the restaurant was trying to screw us.  In short, I will never be back to this restaurant in the foreseeable future. I know that this is my first review but I am more than happy to describe more details about my experience to whoever would find it useful.",0.9908,0.847,0.117,0.036,0.43939909297052143

We had appetizers, a main and split a dessert for the three of us. At the table for apps were meatballs (SUPER tasty -- almost could've been a meatball soup), calamari on bruscetta (excellent) and a mushroom pizza (excellent, though a little on the olive oily side). I had my heart set on the gnocci hours before walking into a restaurant, but I decided to let my freak flag fly and ordered the special: an italian sausage and ham risotto. Also at the table were the veal and a simple spaghetti. Overall, the spag was a bit saltier than I like but super flavorful and spicy. Whatever cheese they used went well to balance the entire meal. The veal was cooked differently than I'd had it before, but was super tasty with a piece of cheese on top. The risotto, on the other hand, deserves its own paragraph. It was not what I expected at all. After careful discussion, we all decided it was undercooked. It was bland and the risotto itself wasn't cooked all the way through. We believed the chef had intended the salty sausage and ham to permeate the rest of the dish, but it didn't. Texture was good. Just fell flat for me. Dessert was a banana cake with hazelnut topping, which was super tasty. The dish was drizzled with a sweet caramel sauce and little bits of coffee bean, an excellent touch. The service was very inconsistent, especially after a $125 bill. The place wasn't packed packed, but was pretty busy for a Tuesday night. And all the tables around us were well tended to. We were waiting for the initial contact, then another 10 minutes before orders for drinks were taken, etc. We ordered an extra plate of bread and it came nearly 15 minutes later. no excuse for the caliber of the restaurant and the number of servers around the room. For the atmosphere, it's beautiful. The bathroom (which I hardly visit) was worth the pee break anyday! It is by far one of the most unique I've seen.

Gioco had something that I had never tried before.  Basically with the antipaste portion you were able to do tastes and get little samplings of things. It was delicious.  We got:  crabcakes which were absolutely delicious (more crab than bread), buffalo mozzarella, eggplant that was like roasted with a bit of I want to say feta cheese, roasted red peppers, and then olives -- the green ones were seriously like the size of your head. . . . . .well, they were big, let's put it that way.  My favorite Italian dish is gnocchi, which is what I wanted that night, but I opted to get the tortelloni instead because it sounded so delicious.  It had spinich and ricotta inside and then was in like a basil cream sauce -- it was phenomenal.  Wasn't too small or too large.  Then of course I had to get dessert and I got creme brule, which I hadn't had in ages.  It was excellent, and with two little chocolate wafer cookies on top.  Also, we got Proseco which I only recently tried at another Italian restaurant and it was absolutely delicious, especially with the meal; sadly I think I could easily polish off like two bottles by myself.  The carbonation makes its seem like its not exactly alcohol. The restaurant had a very cool atmosphere much like Marche and Oprah.  I didn't even notice until after we were done eating, as I was yakking on as usual, but you can actually see where they cook off to the lower right portion of the restaurant.  Also, if you are interested they have a prix fix menu if you choose to go to lunch; Oprah and Marche have it for dinner, which is what I really liked for the other two.  Gioco is absolutely fantastic if you're looking for a very nice Italian dinner out!",0.9981,0.762,0.214,0.023,0.571547619047619

2009-05-14,4.0,"Rating Note:  A ""4"" is a restaurant I would choose and recommend, while a ""5"" means I almost orgasm just eating there. (Sorry - will that be censored). Gioco would get a 3.5 if that was an option. Framing: Been here several times, alone and with others. This review is based largely on my dinner alone this week, but incorporates thoughts from other visits as well. Dined 3/12/09 - bill was $47 with wine, soup and entree. Food: Great food. I had a soup that was FANTASTIC. It was the special soup, with mussels and shrimp in a spciy tomato based white wine sauce. AWESOME!!! For dinner, I had a repeat favorite, the wide noodle pasta with wil boar. Again, very good, albeit I continued to think it was not the most healthy item on the menu. Wine selection is also good, but not great. My chianti was perfect with the meal, however. Service: Always good here, with attention waiters and lots ofp eople filling your water and clearing yoru table. And there is a very attractive server that never smiles but is good to look at. Decor: Decor is just ok, but this is not a problem for me. I go for the good Italian food. Restaurant is narrow and there are wine bottles seperating two eating areas that I always worry I will know over.   Biggest Problem: TOO SMOKY. This is why I would give it a 3.5 if possible. It is hard to eat at Gioco sometimes because the kitchen, which is right out in the open where everyone eats, can cause the entire restaurant to be incredibly smoke. Last night, my eyes were burning so badly I started to leave (but the food is too good, so i stuck it out - but i skipped dessert!)

2009-03-02,4.0,"Updated to review brunch at Gioco I was treated to a birthday brunch at Gioco yesterday and despite the scones tasting little more than baking powder, despite this Italian restaurant being unable to prepare a traditional Bellini, despite spying boxes of Hungry Man pancake mix ... despite all that ... brunch was 500 times better than the horrific brunch I had at the Peninsula Hotel 2 years ago ... yes, a brunch I still can't get off my mind despite many attempts at forgetting it ... maybe hypnosis would work. But I digress. The food and service at Gioco was top notch. Maybe it was the blowing snow yesterday, but the place was basically empty. Considering the fact that just about everything is $11 (at least based on what me and my friends ordered) I would think the place would be busier. Our waitstaff was attentive, friendly and professional and the food was delicious. I read all the reviews here that mentioned brunch and while the stuffed French toast sounded really good, it sounded a bit too sweet for my salt tooth so I went with the Eggs Benedict with crispy pancetta filling in for the ubiquitous Canadian bacon ... a substitute to which I was looking forward. In a word: flawless! The English muffins were perfectly slightly sour and chewy, the eggs were perfectly cooked and the hollandaise was a perfectly seasoned unctuous sauce. One of my friends had the Hangar steak and eggs and another had the Frittata du jour. All of the dishes came with roasted cubed potatoes, whole cloves of roasted garlic and sautéed white onion. I would roast the potatoes a bit more to give them a crunchier exterior, but they were a lovely golden brown and nicely seasoned. We did order the scone du jour, but as I said, it tasted like baking powder and the texture was off. The cinnamon-sugar dipping sauce wasn't that special either. I didn't have any coffee, but my friends seemed to enjoy it in very massive coffee mugs.  The substituted Pomegranate Bellini was very good, but I still have to question any Italian restaurant that doesn't have major inventory of peach puree. Don't worry, I'll get over it and will definitely be back for brunch at Gioco. I can't say the same for the Peninsula Hotel.",0.9979,0.786,0.196,0.018,0.4763899613899614

I went here with a group of friends on a friday night, and they told us at 9PM that it would be a 1.5 hr wait. Let's just say the place has many ""italian tendencies""  (i.e. understands the value of a couple of bucks of persuasion) and after some reasoning we were allowed to sit after only ten.  For a table of 5, we got alot of food and ordered semi-expensive wine at 125 dollars a bottle.   Food: We shared many appetizers and primi and secondi, so i got to taste a lot of the menu here... I HIGHLY recommend the shrimp bucatini (which was marvelously al-dente) in red sauce, the mushroom ravioli, and the veal (secondo). Those entrees really stood out to me in flavor and authenticity. None of the appetizers we had were all that great, including the insalata caprese... the cheese and garnish were altogether uninspired as was the calamari.  Service: It may have been the money we were spending, but the service was fantastic. Our waiter watched closely over us without being intrusive and my water and wine glasses were continuously filled to the top by helpful staff. A chef came out and brought the food to our table, demonstrating the dishes and garnishes as he presented them to us. Quite the show. Environment: they squeeze you in there, thats for sure. Thats actually very italian in custom, so it didn't really bother me. its a nice place, classic decor. The bar is quite handsome as well and fully stocked with quality single malt, which i recommend. Cost: 4/5 Pricey. Entrees were about 30 dollars each and your bill really gets up there if you get wine, appetizers, primo, secondo, and dessert (which you pretty much have to do for the authenticity of the meal).

2008-11-17,1.0,"I went to Gioco because I was given a $100 gift certificate. I was really looking forward to a wonderful meal. I even checked out  the menu on line. When we got there the menu was slightly different and the prices were higher than their website. I hate it when places don't update their websites. On their website they are offering a promotion. When you dine at Gioco any Sunday through Thursday, from Aug 18th -November 18th, and spend $20 per person, each person at the table will receive a $50 gift certificate to Opera!  That sounded great. We went on a Sunday.   When we arrived they were going to seat us really close to another table. The restaurant was not crowded so we asked to sit somewhere else. One complaint is that the tables are too small.  Now for the meal. We ordered fried calamari as an appetizer.  The calamari  were small, over breaded, tasted mushy and left lots of bread crumbs on the bottom of the dish. I felt like I was at a crappy fish 'n' chips joint.  I started wondering if  professional chefs were cooking or just some dudes off the street. For the main course I had the New York Strip in a red wine sauce. It came with diced potatoes mixed with onions and garlic on the side. My husband had the Prime Ribeye that came with mashed potatoes. We were both very unimpressed. My potatoes were hard and cold. For a second I though I was eating a Stouffer's frozen dinner.  The only good thing about our meal was the bottle of Chianti we ordered. When the check came I excused myself to use the lady's room. When I came back I asked my husband if the waiter had given us the gift certificates with our receipt. He said no. I had to get up and ask the host myself. I thought that was really rude and unprofessional. They also did this to a friend of mine.  I'm sure they do this on purpose, hoping that some people don't even know about the promotion.

Well, that all changed with each course that came out of this quaint Italian restaurant. From the Italian bread with the olive oil and Parmesan cheese, to our appetizers of carpacchio and mussels, we were off to a good start.  Our martinis were perfectly poured which made the decision to order a bottle of wine just that much harder. We finally settled on an Amarone (one of my favs). As for entrees we did what we usually do at an Italian restaurant- each ordering one and then splitting a pasta course as a side dish.  The side dish we chose, the server called ""the staff favorite""; penne pasta in a cream sauce with peas and ham and was, quite frankly, some of the best pasta I have had in a long time.  Our steaks were well prepared and each came with a potato side either mashed or roasted. Hard to believe that we had room for dessert after all of that but somehow we found the room for the cannolis and the apple tart.  Both were good although the cannoli was more like sugar crusted custard versus the traditional preparation. Service was spot on which was no small feat given how busy this place was on a Friday night and the size of the station that she was manning So here's a funny thing that happened.  Given all my Yelp reviews- you know I eat out alot.  Obviously this town isn't as big as I think it is as our server comes up to us and calls me by name remembering me from the last restaurant she worked at and that I frequented. I was impressed that she remembered me given how many people she must serve in a night. Oddly enough- there were 2 other servers there that we also knew.  Small world.

Another person in our group had the homemade spaghetti and it sounds boring but the texture of the noodle with the subtle ground Italian sausage ragu was the best I have ever had.   We started with a wild mushroom pizza with pesto and white truffle oil and it was fantastic as well.  Without alcohol the prices are very reasonable.  The pizza starter that was large enough for the group was $10 and each of the pasta dishes were $12-16.  None of the food was heavy as you might think and they serve several fresh fish options at reasonable prices as well.  Bottom line, you may or may not think it is the best Italian restaurant in the city, as it depends on what you want in Italian food, but it could be at the top of your list.",0.9863,0.819,0.162,0.019,0.39316326530612244
2008-09-12,5.0,"One of my new favorite restaurants! This place has incredibly great tasting food.  I went with my wife and a friend, and there was not a single dish that was not superb. For appetizers we ordered a salad that had artichokes, mushrooms, and baby spinach.. as well as beef carppacio with arrugla.  Both were very very good. For main dishes we ordered the Gniocchi, Tortelini with spinach and mushrooms, and Funghi pizza.  Let me tell you all of them were excellent, but the tortellini was to die for!  I would definitely recommend it. We got a side dish of grilled asparagus with parmagiano cheese and that was so tasty as well. Dessert was the vanilla creme brulle with bananas and the panna cotta.  I'm usually not a fan of creme brulle but this one was so good that I couldn't stop eating it. So all in all we ordered 8 dishes and all were above what I've had at almost any italian restaurant.  And they had some dishes I saw the waiters carrying (like the Ribeye and Skirt steak) that looked so good too.. so I know I'm going back to try more! Oh, and for those who want to know about price, for all the food I described above it came out to be $100 after tax (before tip).  Not bad at all for 8 dishes I'd say.",0.9491,0.799,0.142,0.059,0.4916017316017315

Tortelloni is always a great choice - that sage sauce makes me want to lick the dish after I finish. Their gnocchi and pappardelle are also pretty amazing. -Their specials - which is why i can't speak to their regular menu too well. specials...are always amazing though. -Brunch scones!

2008-06-26,3.0,"*Sigh*...Ya know? I've come to Chicago every summer for 3 consecutive years. Each time I've gone to Gioco. The story is...we went to Bologna and for the first time had Papardelle w/ Wild Boar. It was fabulous. If only we could find somewhere that serves it back home. There's gotta be somewhere, right? Of course. Well enter Rachel Ray. Ugh. Okay she does have some good ideas and one of them was Gioco. She orders the Papardelle w/ Wild Boar. Looks awesome. We're going to Chicago as it is - we can't wait to try this....and it's just as good as we hoped.  The Papardelle is fresh...the boar is juicy, succulent, full of flavor. Nothing is too salty - it goes great with our Barolo.  So this most recent time our friends from Ft. Wayne move to Chicago to within a block of Gioco. Couldn't be more perfect! We get there and sit on the street level just above the people on the lower level. Stacked wine bottles serve as a barrier. I look down and looking back at me is a 1980 Biondi-Santi. No it's not empty. The label is a bit mangled..the fill is a bit low...but wow a 28 year old Biondi-Santi. Waiter asks if we have any questions about the wine list. I said ""well actually can you open this for us?"" he says ""well that's all tainted stuff...stuff that's been sitting poorly stored and probably turned."" I said...okay fine. I ordered a $42 bottle of something not very good. My fault. I wanted to keep it affordable. Whatever, here comes our meal! The magnificent boar arrives - my girlfriend and I are stoked...oh what's this? Pine nuts...those weren't there before. Hmm...oh well...wait a second...this doesn't taste the same? In fact...no...it tastes...worse? Is this possible? My beloved Gioco has failed me. The boar isn't as thick, and these pine nuts which belong in Pesto or on a salad...are adding a flavor to this dish that I just don't like. We almost ordered something else. Really. Our friends had the Gnocchi, which I didn't try but was apparently very good - and the Rigatoni with sausage special. Maybe it's time to try something else? But...I come here for the Boar!  So I suppose I put all my eggs in the Wild Boar basket...and that there are other dishes here that are probably great which part of me wanted to try before I sat down.

2008-06-08,4.0,"I came here for dinner with a friend and it was quite nice. I felt mixed about the restaurant's layout, because there is basically a partition in the middle and things felt crowded (people walking by would brush into my chair/ arm/ elbow / bag) where I was sitting. However, they do have an open area where you can see the chefs working, which is nice. I had their artichoke hearts and fennel salad which is really good - light, with a very generous portion of thinly-sliced (think razor!) mushrooms.  I am usually not a fan of cream-based pasta, however, I think in this case you really, truly, must go for the proscuitto, mushroom, green peas pasta (sorry the name escapes me. It's the very bottom left corner of their menu...) I was very excited about their seafood pasta special of the day - there was a good amount of tender shrimp and mini scallops in there, but the tomato sauce was too watery and just not... flavorful enough for my liking. It sounded amazing but just did not live up to it in execution. Also, while I truly appreciate that Gioco hand-makes their pasta,  the pasta was too thick in the seafood special, so it ended up taking away from the other flavors. If it had been an angel hair pasta, perhaps, it would have been better suited. I wish Gioco would serve their bread warm and hot. I think it's such a tease when the restaurants are all about their rustic ovens and stoves, and then the bread comes out cold.  Gioco should at least pretend that they had just pulled that loaf out of the oven!  Finally, the sorbets here are really good. It is very clear that they use the real fruits - I had a kiwi sorbet, a cherry sorbet, and a strawberry sorbet, and the intense flavors of each one really captured the essence of the fruit. Bravo, Gioco, for truly living up to your promise that you use natural, fresh ingredients. I think that dedication really shines through.",0.9963,0.787,0.197,0.016,0.5372681704260651

At first I was skeptical because the selection is somewhat slim, but I scarfed that thing down in about three seconds. The  side potatoes are very good too - although the five cloves of garlic were a little odd. I also had the brioche french toast for dessert (it's brunch you know) and it was good though not orgasmic. The service was attentive if a little catty at times - a good balance for Sunday morning. I was very surprised at the prices too for such good food - only $8-10 for entrees - which is about the same at a much less tasty place.

Not the best, but very good for sure.  We then got the margarita pizza and the Gnochi. Both were amazing. The shrimp in the gnocchi was great and the pizza was amazing.  The restaurant itself still maintains some authenticity to its gangster past. Very nice, speak easy like. We enjoyed every aspect.

2007-06-13,2.0,"What a bust!  I've heard nothing but great things about this place and then I go - what a disappointment. We reserved a table for twelve and upon arrival were made to wait at the bar until everyone was there.  The bar had no good list or way of showing what they had to offer - lame -  I hate having to go through ten minutes of figuring out what they actually can make...  Well, we ended up sitting/standing(there weren't enough seats for all of us) and generally being in the way, until we convinced the hostess it would be better just to sit down  considering they weren't going to give our table away...  She then had us each close our bar tab individually, instead of just transferring them to our meal ticket.  What a pain in the ass. We sit down to eat and there was no Parmesan cheese on the table for the bread and oil.  Shouldn't that be standard? We ordered our hor d'oeuvres, which came surprisingly quickly.  They were okay at best. The food came and it was awful.  Incredibly boring.  There were three people who were please with what they got - two of which were smashed and probably couldn't taste it.   The sorbet & Gelati was overpriced for the servings.  Only two of the 12 flavors we tried were decent. We give good reviews to:  The Wild Boar, The Pizza, & The Bread Pudding...everything else, lame.

We also tried the tiramisu which we were told by the staff was one of the best in the City.  They might not have been exaggerating because this was one of the best I had.  Kelly our server had a full slate of tables but was super attentive and very helpful!
