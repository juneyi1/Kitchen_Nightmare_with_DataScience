2017-06-16,1.0,"Having just been diagnosed with celiac disease, it's been hard to find delivery in the area that offers Gluten Free options. I was excited to see that Ranalli's has a fairly wide selection of GF food options and they've (heretofore) been my go-to for delivery. That was until last night.  My GF burger arrived on a bun that was so hard you could have used it as a hockey puck; not to mention I could taste the freezer burn on it. It should be noted that my last burger arrived in the same manner, but I decided to give them another chance thinking it could have just been an ""off night."" I can safely say, given the food I received last night, they simply don't care about the quality of their food.  As a recommendation to them - if you don't care about the Gluten Free community, don't cater to us. Slapping an OBVIOUSLY stale bun on top of a burger and sending it to a customer (twice) is unforgivable. I'd rather have gotten a call stating that they were unable to fulfill the order because they didn't have the GF buns available.

2015-08-28,2.0,"First off, it should be noted that I actually enjoy the food here. The pizza is good, I've had a salad that I really enjoyed, and the calamari isn't too bad either. The pizza is best when eaten at your home, however, as the service is a damn catastrophe.  The first visit, service was slow. Our server kept forgetting to bring flatware, and would walk by and say things like ""Oh, they still haven't brought it for you!"" as we sat there staring at our salads. Was it the busser's job and not his, even though he saw twice that we had no plates & no flatware? The table next to us was in the same boat. It was annoying, but just a little slow.  Second visit: slow again. But worse. After receiving our beverages, our server left for quite a long time. At the same time, eight 9-year old boys descended onto the two tables behind us and were shouting, fighting over toys, jumping around, and even pushed one set of table & chairs into our table and chairs. One member of my party left to find our server, and I darted to the bar after having a table slam into my chair. It was like being at a Chuck E. Cheese, but without the band, and without having a child of my own drag me there.  I explained to the bar staff the loud, obnoxious group of kids and they said they'd talk to their parents. I head outside, and a woman who I infer was a manager had come to take our order. I mentioned the situation with the unattended kids to her, and her reply was, ""Oh, they're with the birthday party inside. They should be leaving soon."" The look on my face must have not been great, because a moment later she added ""would you like to switch tables?""  We switched tables, carrying everything on our own...I actually had to ask her to move so I could pull up an additional chair so everyone could sit at the new table. Placed our order and food came at a slow but not terrible speed. Our calamari and pizza were quite nice, too.  We had a little hiccup with payment, though that's entirely forgivable...just an unfortunate concurrence with the other events.  A restaurant should not allow one party to infringe upon the enjoyment of another party. They failed to control the situation - a group of loud, unsupervised, poorly behaved kids - and as a result, what should have been a nice summer evening on a patio, was a chaotic, shrieking mess. The parents are as much to blame here as well, but the staff could have gotten the parents to control their children. Saying that ""they're leaving soon"" is not a sufficient response to a complaint about a group that is behaving in a manner that is not acceptable in any restaurant.  I'll only order delivery from here on out because the concept of dine-in guests seems to strain this place.",-0.8176,0.796,0.094,0.11,0.45741582491582505

After I tipped the delivery person, I brought the pizzas inside and opened the boxes. Turns out, she had decided it was ok to not hold the pizza boxes horizontally on her way to my place. Result? The pizzas had slid to the side and folded up and left with a soggy folded down pizza mush. My whole dinner idea was ruined after spending $120 on these clowns. I will update this review with some pictures if I can find them on my phone.  Last night I decided to give them another chance and went in for dinner with a friend. We were two people. When we ordered drinks, I was told that their wine was $6 per glass. We were billed $8 for the cabernet. The veggie pizza for two people came to $21.50 and I barely saw any cheese on it. The base was so soggy that we had to use silverware to eat the pizza. Using our hands was out of question. The waitress' attitude was so indifferent towards us it was as if she was too good for her job or something.  Never going back to this place again. I am all for local businesses, but a circus like this needs to go.",0.7591,0.93,0.05,0.02,0.3611111111111111

They serve a side of dressing on top of salad-unsanitary. And no Parmesan cheese... Why is this called a ceaser? It was gross. The server asked us how everything was at the very end.

I'm a little confused as to the two little pieces of bread provided, seems a bit conservative considering that it's unlimited on the restaurant. The dishes aren't cheap so a full order of bread would be appropriate. Maybe the driver got hungry??  Also no condiments provided for delivery.

""I was going to give you the extra five but you said we were good"".  In my face this kid says that.  Unbelievable.  Okay, you don't give somebody that ten knowing you owe more and then say ""We good?"" and without budging.  So it was my fault for not checking before he left but he bundled my ten to appear the amount was more.  Still, no reason to play your customers.   One, you lied and two, you're a thief, even if you didn't succeed - you attempted to and that is enough to make for a cheat.   That is disrespectful and a bad name to all good and honest drivers not to mention customer service to which I'm a part of let alone manage.  That kid is despicable - I would never hire him.

The salad was okay, the pop tasted like carbonated water and the thin crust pizza (which on the menu it says that it'll be worth the wait) was soggy, had raw onions, raw peppers & undercooked.  The dumb waiter began to tell a story that the pop tasted funny due to a fountain malfunction. Second the pizza (being horribly raw) was a whopping $20.00 for a large 14"".  On the salad I was given like 2 drops of balsamic vinegar and had asked for more. 10 minutes went by and the waiter came and I asked about my vinegar and his excuse was that be forgot.  Really?!?!   Get a grip dude, why don't you have common sense? I had to waive to the waiter every time I needed assistance.  When the bill came, I had to chase him down for him to ring me up.

Today, I took my staff (3 of us total) out to lunch as a thank you for all of the hard work they've done for me. We decided to go to Ranalli's in Andersonville, where we'd been before. We walked in and there was only on e other table of 2 people in the restaurant. We were told by the woman behind the counter to grab two menus and sit anywhere. So we did. The 2 tables pushed together were wobbly and that is always annoying in any dining situation. We waited for about 15 minutes for her to come over and do anything - bring us water, say hi, take our order - just acknowledge us. The women was dealing with a beverage vendor and focused only on that situation. I did make eye contact with her 3 times and thought she would definitely come over to us. As we sat there waiting a walk-in customer went up to the counter and ordered something. We had had it at that point and got up to leave. At THAT moment she yelled over the counter that ""she'd be right with us"". We nicely said, ""No thanks. We don't want to wait anymore."" We then left and walked to anther restaurant in Andersonville and had a great lunch,, but our discussion was that of how absolutely terrible the service was at Ranalli's and whether or not the good food was worth going back to them. The answer we arrived at was ""more than likely not"". I have to say that as a customer and someone who has worked in the service industry for 2 decades that the worst thing you can do is ignore anyone the comes into your establishment and beyond that, making someone feel unwelcome just adds salt to the wound. Please take a look at your business and employees and get your act together, be nicer, pay attention to us the customers and you'll do much better. I'm noticing a lot of negative reviews on here about your restaurant and there's a definite theme... a negative theme.",-0.2391,0.814,0.093,0.093,0.6182539682539683

When we followed her to our table, she simply set our menus down and continued walking without saying a single word to us. She must've been having a bad personal day, because while she was rolling her silverware a few tables away, she sighed (very) loudly. When she brought us water, she walked away and I had to call her back so I can place an order for an appetizer. The food was average to good. Nothing exceptional. However, I'm SURE my taste was already tainted by the lack of service we received.  The calamarie is actually VERY GOOD. The eggplant is sub par.  I onced ordered a pizza from them for delivery via grubhub, which was good as well. I'll give them another chance and I'll dine in again.

Two complaints, though: they charge, per ingredient, for each topping you put on the GF pizza. So what would be a $13 pizza suddenly turned into a $16 personal sized pizza with the addition of the Greek toppings. That's getting pricey, and a little bit sneaky. My second complaint was the waitress, who was chatting it up with all of the other tables and just handed us our food. She never checked, not even once, to see how our meal was going.

2011-02-05,2.0,"Slow food: 1.  An international movement founded by Carlo Petrini in 1986. Promoted as an alternative to fast food, it strives to preserve traditional and regional cuisine and encourages farming of plants, seeds and livestock characteristic of the local ecosystem. ( en.wikipedia.org ) 2. Every meal I've ever eaten at Ranalli's of Andersonville. I have a group of high maintenance friends. Individually, we're not really hard to please, but when you plan a group meal we're a nightmare. See, we need a restaurant that is or has: vegetarian friendly, gluten-free friendly, gluten-free vegetarian friendly, reasonable parking options, relatively cheap prices, good for groups, takes reservations, and BYOB preferably without a corkage fee. Like I said, nightmare. As a result we typically rotate between two restaurants, one of them is Ranalli's. I'll be honest, the food here has never blown me away. It's fine, but if it weren't for the fact that they have an entire gluten free menu, it wouldn't even be on my radar. I've had a few different pastas, which were just ok. I wish there was a better selection of veggies in the pasta primavera. It's served with spinach, zucchini and peas, but I wish they matched the assortment of veggies in the grilled veggie appetizer (broccoli, carrots, peppers, zucchini, etc.). The pesto is way too oily for my liking. Going forward, I plan on sticking with the pizza; that seems to be where they really shine. With thin, extra thin, pan and stuffed and a great selection of toppings, it's good stuff. The thin and extra thin are my personal favorites. The slow service is what brought this from a 3-3.5 star experience down to a 2.5 star one. Every time I've eaten here I've found service inattentive and slow, but this last visit was over-the-top slow. I understand why they may have been hands off at first, with the weather our party trickled in over the course of a half hour. However, it did not end when our party was complete. Every time we needed more water, cups, wine glasses, and to place our orders we had to hunt our server down. We were never even served bread until I asked for it and even then it came much, much later; it felt like 30 minutes, but to be fair I wasn't timing it. Our food also took what seemed like an eternity with no explanation from our elusive server. When my dish came *mostly* right, I was too hungry to waste the time having it fixed or even noting it. Once we finished (approximately 3.5 hours after I put my butt in a seat), it was another chore to track down the check - despite wallets out on the table - and then catch her to run my card. At one point a friend was so irritated and tired, she tossed her money on the table and took off. There's no way a dinner of pizzas and pastas should take 3.5-4 hours, no way at all. Will I be back? Yes, unless we can find another place to slip into the rotation and suit our high maintenance needs. Will I be excited about it? Hell no.",0.9961,0.782,0.163,0.055,0.4714978354978353

You can end up getting great pizza for a reasonable price. There is a decent liquor store one block south at the corner of Foster and Clark. So no need to worry about forgetting to bring a bottle or some beer. But there is just one big problem. You guys need to keep watch over the freshness of your salad greens. Clearly they come from a bag, and sometimes I get leaves that are a bit on the brown and slimy side. It has happened twice. After the first time I swore not to order a pre-pizza salad again on my next visit. But sometimes it feels good to have some greens before a cheese/carbo fest which is the essence of a great Chicago style stuffed pizza. So I ordered again and the salad was okay. But most recently we were hit with the brown slimy leaf stuff. Sure - if a bag sits in the back of my fridge for slightly too long, I have been known to try and salvage it a bit.

We told our server who was super nice and polite and said he'd definitely pass that info along ... then Jen the manager/owner came over herself to discuss.  She said she thought it was a great idea to do a whole cheese, and a half sausage/half pepperoni on their Pizza-by-the-slice.  Crisis averted!  This of course doesn't affect us directly because we can't just get ONE SLICE, we must order an entire pizza : ) We also were a bit chilly and they didn't mind bumping the heat up a little to make us more comfortable.   The extra thin Pizza is FANTASTIC!  Green olives and mushrooms 0 yum!

Don't expect the most creative or fancy-schmancy meal out there. Ranalli's delivers on the down-home favorites you know and love. Comfort food, if you will.  One of my favorite girlies had her birthday dinner at Ranalli's. It was served family style, so I was able to try many of the menu items. Some favorites included:  Chopped Salad - Greens topped with chicken, gorgonzola, bacon,  kalamata olives, tomatoes, red onions and a pretty awesome vinaigrette. I love a good salad and I especially loved this one because it's not too heavy on the dressing OR the toppings. Is it so wrong to want a little lettuce in my salad?  Ravioli with what I'm pretty sure was the alfredo sauce - The ravs were nice and light and the alfredo sauce wasn't at all offensive. Usually I'm turned off because alfredo tends to be a clumpy, glumpy mess, but this one was light and yummy.  Chicken wings - Wings at an Italian place? Can they do that? Well, yes, they can and they do! I think they're more like breaded fried chicken and less of the ooey, gooey, dripping with sauce variety, but satisfying, none the less.  Pizza - Oh yeah. Ranalli's has an amazing thin crust happening. And their toppings are top notch! I really enjoyed flavorful sausage and fresh veggie pizzas. Mmmm!!!! I know there's this whole movement towards less sauce on pizzas, but I say fuggedaboutit! I need some sauce up on my 'za. I liked that Ranalli's doesn't skimp on that tomato goodness.  Complaints? Well, it was pretty toasty in there. I saw the thermostat set at like, 78 degrees, which is warmer than I like when I'm at a restaurant. Other than that, very, very nice!

I was saddened that there was no booze at this Andersonville location. It is BYOB, however, which is kind of cool I guess since Andersonville Wines and Spirits is just around the corner. We went somewhere else that night, but I did order from Ranalli's a few weeks later. I thought it was kind of expensive for what we got, but my girl swears that the hamburger is one of the best ever. My pasta was kind of bland, and my order was missing a soup. I called about the soup and they wrote my name down for a free one. We ordered the exact same thing a few weeks later with the same results - except the soup came the second time. We decided to actually go there last night after walking down Clark Street for a while. The decor was really nice- a lot swankier than other locations. Our waiter was cool. I asked him if my name was still on the list for the soup and he said he would just give one to me without checking the list. Cool. I was hungry, so I ordered the two barbecue chicken breasts dinner. My girl ordered the Rosemary Salmon. Both with sides of spaghetti. The chicken breasts were so small that they reminded me of the tiny pounded-out prepackaged ones from the Jewel. The spaghetti was watery, and the marinara tasted like raw tomatoes. I guess I just don't have the luck here that my girl does, she loved the salmon.

The tomato part of the bruschetta was very good: fresh tomatoes and plenty of garlic! The bread portion was more like extra large croutons and tore up my mouth the way Cap'n Crunch does. The extra thin crust is probably amazing right out of the oven. It's cracker-thin and just charred enough. Sadly, it acquires the texture of an old saltine as it sits in the box. This is not the restaurant's fault at all, but they'd be doing customers a favor if they advised against ordering it  for consumption anywhere other than on the premises.
