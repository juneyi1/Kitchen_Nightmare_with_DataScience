2017-09-03,5.0,Started our day in the city with visit to Kumas on Belmont. Took my son/wife- he got the Kuma burger and I got the burger of the month. My wife got the salmon burger. All  were great. I ask for med- rare and almost no one does it right but Kumas does. My son loved the pulled pork fries. He asked me if we comeback can they put it on a burger- I'm sure they can. Great beers on tap.  Look forward to our return trip. Will give the Schaumburg ones try next/ live in the burns-unfortunately - and don't get to the city as much as I like.,0.9652,0.822,0.166,0.012,0.6655753968253969
2017-09-02,5.0,"This Chicago staple offers up some of the best burgers in the city. With a heavy metal atmosphere they cook up unique burgers cooked to preference and Mac and cheese. If you appreciate burgers then Kuma's corner is definitely a Chicago bucket list item for you.  First off their beer list is great, serving beer from many local brewery's- including half acre, 3 floyds and many more. I got the scorched tundra VIII by pipeworks brewing, which is a deliciously citrusy and tropical IPA with an appropriately malty body and smooth finish. The gf got the kiss the sun, which had white whisky, pineapple, the afore mentioned IPA, and a spicy kick.  For the burger we settled on the Kuma's burger to appreciate their burger making skills. This includes a pretzel bun, bacon, cheese, lettuce, onion, tomato, egg and 10 oz burger. We ordered this medium rare and it came exactly as I imagined it. This is a solid burger with a great beefy flavor. It's rare that medium rare is done right on a burger but they did it. The toppings were all fresh but the bun was a bit doughy. Overall solid burger, we will try another version next time. Also the fried were perfectly fried with just the right amount of salt. Come for the burgers, stay for the beer. Make your judgement of whether Kuma's or Au Cheval is the best Chicago burger. Drink some whisky on tap.

I went with the fries, and she went with the chips. Our food, while a bit too heavy to handle (and a little on the expensive side) was very tasty. We also loved the atmosphere, and our waitress couldn't have been nicer. One thing sort of ruined the experience for us, though--our napkins were disgusting. This may not seem like a big deal, but they stunk so badly they affected our taste buds. They smelled like dirty dish towels that had been hanging on the edge of a cupboard for everybody to dry their hands on. My wife's also had food on it. She didn't make a big deal out of it, but she asked for another. Her second one didn't have any food on it, but the smell wasn't any better.  Needless to say, we weren't able to finish our burgers. We brought our leftovers home, but I doubt that we'll ever finish them. Every time we remember they're in the fridge, we think of the way our napkins smelled, and our stomachs start to turn.

Staff is attentive. The food is good but nothing to go out of your way for if you are craving a delicious Chicago burger. Had the jalapeño poppers to start. The jalapeños are stuffed with a cheese chorizo accompanied by a jalapeño jam dipping sauce. It's crunchy but definitely makes you think twice if it was worth eating after those 3 miles you ran in the gym. I say it's probably not. Ordered the Iron Maiden burger. You can't go wrong with pepperjack cheese, lettuce, tomato, red raw onions, avocado and cherry peppers on a burger. However,I did find myself adding hot sauce to every bite. I think the burger needed an extra kick of flavor. I gave 3 stars because it's not the hype it used to be and I can recommend a few places that I'd rather kick my burger craving to.

Its heavy metal theme rings through and through (and makes it hard to hear anyone or anything else). Even the waitress has to crouch down really close to hear your order. But, I kind of expected the loud music coming in (its reputation as a heavy metal joint is accurate). So, I'm NOT complaining about the music. I also appreciated the heavy metal themed names of the burgers. This is a really creative element that adds extra flair for sure!  For my meal, I figured ""go big or go home!"" And ordered the ""Slayer."" It was enormous! Beneath a mound of fries and chili and cheese sat a thick meaty burger. I was beyond excited to take a bite. In fact, I needed a knife and fork to sink into this thing!! Unfortunately, the burger looks much better than it tastes. The entire time, I felt like I was eating spoonfuls of salt. And, I had to take half of it home (not because of its size, mind you...I'm not one of those girls who takes a bite of a salad and gets ""full;"" I'm a gal who can eat). The fries were coated in salt, too. It was basically a salt explosion. I mean, when you order a burger called ""The Slayer,"" you expect a pretty monstrous plate of food.

There are things about this place that a lot of people would find annoying, the very crowded atmosphere, the loud metal music, the people hovering behind you for seats if you end up sitting at the bar.

I've had mistakes happen a few times, but that's possible anywhere so you can't really complain. Overall the service has been really great, they are always attentive and kind, the bartenders slightly less so but they have more on their plates so that's entirely understandable. Note for if you sit at the bar: they play a lot of really cheesy horror movies, so you can watch them as you eat and drink! On to the food, the burgers I'll talk about in a minute but...the mac and cheese...god damn the mac and cheese is so good, don't pass it up, GET IT! I usually do bacon and red peppers in the mac and cheese, but I'm sure any of them would be fantastic! The Buffalo Tenders, BBQ Pork Fries, and Fried Pickles are all solid, but the mac is definitely better. Now on to the burgers, god damn, you really can't go wrong with any of them, obviously the famous kuma is the most common one, and also absolutely delicious, but so are the mastodon, the black sabbath, the led zepplin, the pantera, the iron maiden, and I'm sure many others.

The burgers are amazing. I had the Led Zeppelin medium rare. The fries were great too (my gf got the chips not as good as the fries). One of the out of town guys got mac and cheese. We were so jealous,  it was amazing. He got andouliole sausage,  bacon, and another topping in forgot. We love mac and cheese and now we know this is the place. Dont let the atmosphere scare you this is a Chicago staple we should all visit at least once in life. I'll be back plenty. The staff was good at reading the people at the table and acting accordingly. The food was so good compliments to the chef. There was even parking with no hassle.

2017-05-21,2.0,"Hankering for a burger, which is rare, and stumbled upon this joint in Yelp as it had a ton of reviews with high rankings! I came, I tasted and I know that next time I'm craving a burger, I definitely won't be coming here. People talk about these scene; it's a metal-esque pub style bar. Although not my type of music, the place did not turn me off. The servers are attentive and nice, and the place has some spunk to it that's for sure.  Now for the food- I stick to basics when it comes to burgers and got a traditional style burger that's simple. Also got a Mac and cheese with bacon, fresh jalapeños, topped with scallions and breadcrumbs. I've got to say the Mac and cheese stole the show. Probably one of the best Mac and cheeses I've had as it had a smooth and luscious coating of creamy sauce with chunks of fresh added ingredients that did not get lost in the mix. I wish I could say the same about the burger but it didn't have that fresh, grilled flavor, it was over cooked and their pretzel bun was dry and stale tasting. As I looked through some credible yelper's reviews that typically never steer me wrong I noticed the dates of a few years ago. Maybe the flavors have changed over the years; not sure.. but I do know that I won't be back when that burger craving hits.",0.9451,0.911,0.089,0.0,0.5413008971704624

Honestly the worst part about trying Kuma's Corner, was coming home and realizing no burger might ever compare to the best burger I have ever had at Kuma's. It was that good. I had the Plague bringer which was just a mess of a burger covered in hot sauce, garlic, garlic mayo, jalapeños, tortilla chips, truly the best burger I have ever eaten! My boyfriend got the slayer, which is the featured video on the Food network. Which if you want to be enticed to check this place out, I highly recommend watching. The slayer is a giant burger on a bed of fries covered in andouille sausage, chili, cheese, and just a mess of deliciousness. My boyfriend was extremely satisfied with it! Although our main entrees was more than enough to have us stuffed, the appetizers were extremely enticing, and we had to try the jalapeños poppers, which were cream cheese and chorizo stuffed with raspberry jalapeño jam. So delicious and definitely worth being so full! The atmosphere is great, it has a heavy metal/rock vibe and truly the best food I had in Chicago/ maybe anywhere.

There was no wait and the place had great service, burgers, variety, service, and atmosphere. However, I had to score Kuma's 3-3.5 stars for two reasons:  1) Since our order waited at a staging area until it was complete, the meal was served at different temperatures: the burger was hot, the bun was cold, and the fries were lukewarm. I mean, I'm into contrast regarding food but not temperature-wise.  2) Apparently Kuma's resides in the alternate universe where burgers and fries for two and an appetizer (mind you, we only drank water) at a hole-in-the-wall type establishment costs $50.

Is she just keeping a mental note?"" We almost decided to just go down the street to eat, but we decided to stick it out. We were standing around for about 30 minutes so we ordered some drinks while we waited.  NOW, another party showed up and she greeted them, asked them how many people and so forth.

It's the perfect mix of flavors - sweet, salty, slightly acidic and a bit spicy. If you're not feeling as adventurous, the Mastadon is always a safe choice - bbq sauce, cheddar cheese and fried onion strings. I'm also a weird person who loves blue cheese on her burgers, so I'm a total fan of the Metallica burger as well!

I normally just get a burger and housemade chips, but I tried the jalapeño poppers to start. I was blown away at the flavor with the chorizo in the poppers and with the raspberry sauce to dip.... they were the best poppers I have had in the country. And that speaks volumes. They were large in size so the price for the appetizer was a deal.  I went with the Plague Bringer since I wanted to try something new. When eating at Kuma's, having your burger cooked Med Rare is the way to go. The flavor of every ingredient fit perfectly together. Extremely juicy with a mild kick from the jalapeño slices.  My girlfriend went with the Lair of the Minotaur. The brie cheese practically dissolved in your mouth after each bite.  I always will consider Kuma's to be one of the top burger joints in Chicago.

The February 2017 burger of the month was a burger with blackened chicken, waffle strips, and syrup on it - looked great and my friend said it was one of the best burger's they've ever had. I opted for the Mastodon, a perfectly balanced BBQ burger. It had BBQ sauce, sharp cheddar cheese, and ""frizzled"" onion on a pretzel like bun. Delicious. Not too saucy and again just the right balance of toppings. Came with fries which were delicious, classic style. Overall food = amazing, but expect a wait when you're coming here.

For our burgers, we tried the Slayer, Iron Maiden with chicken, the Yob, and the Lair of the Minotaur.  All of the burgers came on pretzel buns (yum!) and had large patties cooked to order exactly to temperature.  Tip- if you're a wimp when it comes to spice, you're going to be a bit limited on your menu options.  But I was happy with my Lair of the Minotaur burger.  The pancetta was crispy and the brie and pears added a nice creaminess and sweetness, respectively.   On the other end of the spectrum, my friend who had The Slayer couldn't stop talking about how spicy it was.  This isn't actually a burger at all, just a patty on fries covered in tons of other ingredients, including chili, cherry peppers, onion, andouille sausage, and monterrey jack cheese.

I visited Kuma's on a weekday for lunch and ordered the Kuma lunch special which is basically a smaller version of the Kuma burger. This lunch special came with a side of fries. I loved it!

The burger was tender and there was a substantial amount of meat in the patty. One bite sends you into sensory/umami overload! I never had a succulent burger with a runny fried egg but after having this one, I can't have burgers made any other way. This one is definitely the gold standard. As for ambiance, this place caters to clientele with an open mind. The servers are prompt and polite. It's just that the atmosphere may be off-putting to some folk.

I had the Neurosis and the burger was quite good. My only knock was that the bun was a bit overwhelming.  However - the waitress ruined the experience. We walked in and went to a table. We were then informed that we needed to sit at her table - in the back corner. So we did and ordered drinks - as well as asking for menus. Her response ""well if we'd seated you, you'd have gotten them then.""  There was not a 'wait to be seated' sign anywhere.  Her overall bitchy demeanor continued throughout the experience. My friend ordered the Kuma burger special, by pointing at it on the menu. When the bill came she was charged for a different burger. When she asked the waitress replied ""well you didn't specify which you wanted and the portion would have been different.""   So while I really enjoyed my burger, that nightmare waitress ruined the experience.  It's really a shame because I could have seen my buddies and I hanging out there for beers and burgers in the future.",0.8297,0.824,0.108,0.068,0.47470238095238093

We waited for about 30 minutes for a table in this nice snug restaurant.  The music is a little bit loud as I was even having a hard time hearing our server.  Our server recommended the monthly specials to us which were changing in just two days.  Taking her recommendation, I ordered the devil's hot mess - chicken tenders coated in Frank's hot sauce, mac and cheese, with pickled jalapenos and I was so happy I took her recommendation!  This is every spicy eater's dream.  The bowl was huge - probably twice the size of my entire face by the time I threw in the towel it didn't even look like I had put a dent into the dish.

Our server was good with checking in on us however I ordered a side of FRIES with my Iron Maiden burger but I got chips. Also the burger bun was cold but the burger itself was still warm so I think it was a time issue and they were trying to push out orders and didn't bother toasting the bun. Also it came on a pretzel bun which was too chunky so I ended up with a bunch of cold bread. And I don't want to seem nitpicky but I ordered a medium burger and it was well done (granted medium is a bit tricky to pull off but well I was worried about getting something too raw and figured tipping towards overdone would be safer since this was my first time here). I got beer as well and it came in a cracked glass.   I probably should have said something because xyz happened but they were really busy and I was in a good mood and couldn't really be bothered.

Not only do they have absolutely mouth-watering 0.5-lb burgers with crazy toppings and great metal music, they also have an awesome mac N cheese selection. I'm not a big mac-n-cheese dude, but this place is great. This place has a cool outdoor patio as well, in the back, and the inside dining area is somewhat small... I estimate about 14 or so tables, but the tables are pretty close together, so prepared to shuffle your feet and between tables to get to your seat. No biggie really. If you don't want to wait to be seated, you can ask the staff to sit at the bar; wait times for the bar is usually shorter than for a table. Although this place has heavy metal music pumped out from their speakers, the music isn't super-loud where you need to yell at each other to hear what the other person is saying. Lighting here is a little dim, but overall, a great place to take a date or to just chill with the boyz. I got the ""Metallica"" Burger, which consisted of blue cheese (I'm a sucker for it) dressing, lettuce, tomato, onions, buffalo sauce (sucker for it too!), and bacon. Cooked to however you like it, I went with ""medium"". The burger was cooked perfectly and the burger was huge. In the past visit, I got the ""Lair of the Minotaur"" burger, and that was money too!. Pretty much, I have yet to have a bad burger here. They also have a Happy Hour from 4-6PM where they have some discounted beers on tap, so if you're in that area at that time, definitely stop by for some discounts (funny how neighboring Square Bar doesn't have HH specials, as of Sept 2016). For mac-n-cheese, you can pick your toppings. We went with the chicken and bacon. Note, if you don't like scallions/green onions, make sure you tell them, or else they will sprinkle them on top. The mac-n-cheese was nice and creamy and the macaroni was cooked perfectly. I'm telling ya -- a skeptic like me, who thinks ""what's the big deal about Mac N Cheese? Why would people pay for it at a restaurant?"" the mac n cheese is definitely something you should try.

2016-08-08,5.0,"Officially my new fave spot in the city. Shame on me for waiting so long. I have heard TONS about Kuma's for years. Unfortunately, I had never gotten around to trying it out. Mainly because I was told it was small and there's usually quite a hefty waiting time/line (this became apparent and true the longer I was there Saturday). Aside from the popularity of the restaurant, I also heard the food was just plain awesome. My friends and I stopped here before our Revolution Brewery Tour Saturday and oh my gosh am I glad I finally got the opportunity to visit.  One little secret about me: I love metal, heavy metal, new metal, old metal. Yes, I'm talking Metallica, Slipknot, Trivium, etc. No one had told me Kuma's Corner was the coolest heavy  metal themed restaurant in Chicago. Walking into Kuma's was the biggest most pleasant surprise, ever. The walls are red, there are ""hipster killer"" beers, guitars, band t-shirts, beer signage and all things heavy, odd and in-your-face. Fortunately, when my gang and I had arrived at Kuma's we got seated right away. The waitresses and employees all had the same look: tattoo sleeves, dark hair and crude t-shirts. I loved it. Our waitress in particular didn't have the most outgoing personality but served us well. She was very accommodating, filled our waters constantly, made trips to our table to be sure we were taken care of and had the most beautiful tattoo portrait on her forearm. Respect. We had ordered fried pickles to start. These were easily the best I've had. They were of decent size, there was a sufficient amount of them and my boyfriend and I agreed they had the tastiest and crunchiest breading. I wasn't even planning on ordering an appetizer but God dang I'm glad I did. Two of us got burgers and two of us got mac & cheese. I can only speak for the mac & cheese but the men in my group both agreed it was an AWESOME burger - juicy, big and the fries that accompanied it were great too. The mac & cheese comes with breadcrumbs and scallions on top and allows you to add ingredients from a list for $2 extra (list includes ingredients such as sun-dried tomatoes, bacon, broccoli, etc.) I had ordered the chicken for my mac & cheese. This dish was VERY cheesy, tasty and the serving could literally last me 3 days. It was easily like 2 lbs of noodles. We were on our way to a brewery tour so we weren't interested in purchasing drinks but I would absolutely love to come back to try some of their beers. Overall, Kuma's Corner had already sold me with the theme of the restaurant. I'm so happy Chicago has a place like this. No Katy Perry playlist or DJ blasting in your ear here. The food just confirmed my love for this place. I will DEFINITELY be back.",0.9985,0.756,0.207,0.037,0.565286944385305
2016-08-07,5.0,"I have been to Kuma's twice, and both times were great visits. The burgers here may be the best that I have had.  1st Visit: I ordered the Plague Bringer and the side salad. The burger was cooked to order at medium rare, and it was very juicy and seasoned well. I also never thought I would say this, but the side salad was delicious. It has a Basil Vinaigrette dressing that is really flavorful, and sets this apart from any side salad that I have eaten.  2nd Visit: I tried the Slayer. This is a burger on a bed of fries, covered with chili, hot peppers, onions, sausage, and cheese. The meat was, again, cooked perfectly. The chili had the right amount of spice. It wasn't overpowering, but gave the dish a nice kick. (Side note: I enjoy very spicy foods, so it may be too spicy if you don't have a high tolerance.) The fries are pretty good on their own, but are delicious with the mix of ingredients on the Slayer.  My guests on these two visits enjoyed the Kuma and Led Zeppelin burgers, and we're all looking forward to returning to try their Mac & Cheese. I have not had an issue with the staff. I can see the wait times being ridiculous at times, but I had good luck at 5pm Saturday after a Cubs game and 12pm Sunday for lunch. This place is also big on heavy metal. It will add to your experience if that is your type of music, but even if it's not, it is just something that makes the restaurant unique.

The music was great, the waitstaff was just the right amount of helpful while still maintaining a metal edge.  Note: there will most likely be a wait. It's not a big place, you can just hop over to Square right across the street to grab a drink.  The metal mac and cheese looked amazing, I regret not getting some while I was there. I had the Metallica and Goatsnake. Both were phenomenal and ohh so perfect. My pal ordered his Mid Rare, and it came out on the Med range. That would be literally my only issue the whole time I was there. The people watching is gold there too.  If you're into Heavy Metal, this is a must visit.

2016-05-15,5.0,"Honest review: love this place best burgers in chicago, their big juicy and come with fries! The wait can be long so go on a weekday or before 8 pm. The music can be really loud at times they should lower it. service good 12$ Jalepeno poppers: amaiazing! Best one i ever had! Its not just like ur typical poppers. The outside is supper crunchy due to the panko bread crumbs n their not greasy or burnt. The jalepeno is fresh and big not supper small. The cream cheese filling is amaizin theres chorizo inside but wish there was more chorizo because theirs not alot. The dipping sauce is what makes it great, its a sweat sauce so it makes the dish sweat and salty. Would order again its not supper spicy as u would think cause theirs no seeds n the veins of jalepeno have been taken out. My only complain was it needed some salt it is busy so maybe they forgot to season Mac n cheese $14: this is one of my favorite mac n cheeses. Its a huge portion its not ur typical lil container so be warned to not order more tjen 1. I got it this time with bacon and chicken. The chicken was flavorful not dry not alot of pieces and there wasnt alot of bacon in it either so plz add more! It was really cheesy no american cheese thank u cheese but it wasnt as creamy as i remember it was maybe they make it a new way? Still good the love the bread crumbs on top wish there was bread crumps on all of the mac n cheese not just the middle though. some of the pasta didnt have cheese on it so they might not have made a béchamel wish u must so its really creamy. I understand presentation is important but putting raw onions on sometjint is a no no the raw onion flavor over powers everything n ruins the pallet  still a really good mac n cheese one of the best ive had just fix the issues n itll be even better Slayer $16: (we warned its huge couldnt finish it all) first lets talk about the actual burger its so flavorful!! Like u could jus eat the patty by itself its seasoned beutifully not bland at all. Then the size of it is huge ur really get ur moneys worth. Its cooked to perfection supper moist. The chili is the star of the dish its so flavorful one of the best chilis i ever had. It adds so much richness and depth to the dish. My one complaint is theres not enough chili, the chili is what makes this dish so Add more plz. Then theres fries omg omg their fries are so good perfectly fried u can tell they fried it more then once their supper crunchy without being burned or greasy i love these fries omg so good. One issue is i wish the fries were on top so they would stay crunchy n wouldnt get soggy Another issue they season them with sea salt so they could be a lil salty though but that can easily be fixed by changing the salt they use, n if u get an order with fried it comes with ketchup i think thats childish fries should always get served with an aioli still one of the best fries i ever had. Omg there is so much cheese I love it! Nothing goes better with a burger then cheese! Theres pickled peppers which add a nice acidic heat that cuts through the richness of the dish! Love the heat! Theres andouille sausage which i love but i like my sausage charred on the grill its a personal prefference just it makes sausage taste so much bettter but i loved the sausage its so much better then bacon. I wish they would add an egg to make it more rich and more decadent since thats what their going for, even adding some bbq pork would cut down some of the richness and the saltiness of the dish.i would order this in a heart beat one of the best burgers i ever had Yob 15$: based on the description it sounded to plain but it really is delicous perfect combination of sweet and salty. The bell pepper is really sweet and cooked nicely i dont like my vegetables to crunchy, the sweetness pairs beautifully with the saltiness of the burger. I dont like gouda cheese but in the burger it goes perfect with everything the smokey cheesy flavor makes the burger decadent, so mych so, that u will not stop eating it. Then theres bacon omg yes nothing makes a burger taste better then bacon. The sauce on the burger makes it so rich but its not to overwhelming with the garlic which is a good thing I have no complaints of this burger but next time i come i wanna try the more adventurous burgers  Fries:I jus wish instead of ketchup they would serve aioli cause ketchup is to basic. An issue with the fries is since they use sea salt they could be salty but this can be fixed with regular salt, or u can just remove the salt yourself. Bbq fries 13$: the fries are Their perfectly crisp. The fries have been fried multiple times without being greasy or burnt, it is very hard to make fries correctly and kumas corners does an amaizing job! I jus wish instead of ketchup they would serve aioli. The bbq pork is really tender and flavorful not dry or old which bbq pork can be. The bbq sauce is sweet but not overwhelmingly sweet. The saltiness of the fries and the sweetness goes perfectly togethe",0.9998,0.71,0.243,0.048,0.5255895065474505

2016-04-21,4.0,"Kuma's Corner is an establishment that's been around for years and there's not much I can say that hasn't already been stated. However for anyone who still hasn't been (BTW what are you doing? Go there now.) let me give you an idea as to the atmosphere of the place. Here are 4 of the questions the owner Michael Cain like's to ask when hiring staff: - Dog or Cat - Tell me a joke - If you could be a fruit what kind of fruit would you be and why - You have 30 seconds to burp as loud as possible Kuma's Corner is a Heavy Metal themed restaurant specializing in burgers and has the most eclectic staff and clientele of anywhere, I've had half the burgers on the menu and they're all great. But my go-to burger seems to be the Plague Bringer. I've also had the mac & cheese which is very good. It's often said these are the best burgers in Chicago. I'd actually argue these are the best burgers in the country. The only burgers in the city that I think rival Kuma's are the burgers by Rockit and at that point it really just comes down to preference. I've been to all three Kuma's locations but the original is still my favorite. It's probably because it has that edginess to it and feels more intimate in a way. The other two are nice but you can tell they were toned down to make them more ""family friendly."" That being said the thing that I don't like about the place is that it's so small and crowded most of the time. Walk-in waits are often 1 hour+. Whenever I plan to go here it's at an odd hour like for a late lunch or early dinner because as much as I love the burgers I am not going to wait 90 minutes to eat. I have yet to eat there when the have the outdoor seating open but I imagine it doesn't make much difference.  Alas that is the one thing that prevents them from getting a 5 star review. That might now be fair given that it's just an indicator of how good and how popular they are. But don't let my knit-picking get in the way.

2016-04-18,5.0,"We ventured in to Kuma's Corner on a recommendation and had a great meal. Décor: This is a heavy metal bar that is staffed by rockers and plays nothing but metal (which is all a welcomed change from the usual!). The music is by no means too loud and the windows provide plenty of natural light. The décor is a mix of quirky funny stuff and... of course, metal (albums). The bar is large and can seat more than a few, there are a bunch of tables (with plenty of room to move), and place is kept rather clean. We sat at the bar and had a full view of the (small) kitchen, so we got to see all the delightful treats the three cooks were making. Bathroom: Two words, clean and graffiti haha. Staff: Since we sat at the bar we only had the bartender(s) but they were super nice and accommodating. The place was full, not overly crowded, so everyone was busy, but we were well attended to. The cooks did an amazing job with the food as well. Food: We forwent on beers, just weren't feeling it, and instead had a root beer (from the tap, very tasty) with our burgers. We had a Kuma Burger (perfectly cooked medium) with fries (delicious) and a Black Sabbath with chips (delicious! Perfectly cooked and had a side of horseradish mayo that was outstanding!). The burgers are big, the sides are plentiful, and everything is delectable. Value: A (beef) burger + side is $10, how can you go wrong?

They have a metal theme, as in music, and it is playing loudly throughout. All the burgers are named after metal bands, as well. For me, the black sabbath was where it's at. It is a burger topped with onion then covered in chili. Delicious. The chili was generously heaped on and tasted great. What really sets it apart is the pretzel bun (I think all the burgers come with it). It tastes more pretzel-like than any bun I've ever had, and it is thick, fresh, and soft. Really delicious. While waiting we had jalapeno poppers, which come filled with a cheese mixed with chorizo. Very unique and worth a try. Can't end this review without mentioning the entertainment. They had TVs above the bar playing snowy night deadly night, a horror b-movie with killer santa killing naked woman with weapons from his jolly red sack.  One other note, the place fills up with smoke from the grill, not sure if they need to fix that hood or if it's just part of their charm, but your clothes will carry the scent of beef with you when you leave. At first that was welcomed because the place had a powerfully delicious smell of burgers. By the time we left, though, the smoke was hurting my poor eyes.

My boyfriend and I got here around 5:30 on a Thursday night and the wait was very friendly. We were seated immediately. Pro tip: they won't seat you unless your whole party is there! Also take advantage of the beer specials! I ordered the Lair of the Minotaur burger (pancetta, bourbon poached pears, brie) medium rare. It was more medium than medium rare but still really juicy so no complaints there. The pretzel bun was also really good at keeping everything together. It was greasy, but what else do you expect from a burger? The pears were really good and the brie was so, so rich. Gripes: I felt like the patty was underseasoned. It honestly didn't have that much taste even though I knew it was solid quality. I couldn't taste the pancetta either. My boyfriend tried the Slayer burger, which was a RIDICULOUS amount of food. He eats a lot already and he was starving when we got there, but he only finished probably around half. I tried a couple of bites when we were there and it was pretty good - a little over the top for me, but hey, that's how Chicago does food. Unfortunately the overwhelming flavor for the Slayer is salt, so that made it a lot harder to eat. I couldn't tell from a few bites but he said that it was pretty much impossible to eat towards the end.

However, my boyfriend is a vegetarian and I am a veggie patty enthusiast. Kuma's veggie patty (is?!) WAS- so fucking good. In a world of black been and sweet potato veggie patties, kuma's had the exception to the rule. I eat beef but their veggie patty was (is??!) so good that I could not resist.  Last night I had a really rough day at work. Let's be honest, it's been a rough week. A rough month. I knew exactly what I needed: that mother fucking kuma's veggie patty.  Alas, when I got home with my carry out my tastebuds were in utter disbelief. My beloved kuma's veggie patty was now a black bean-based, southwestern inspired, mass of disappointment. My boyfriend and I traded bites of our burgers only to find that each one tasted like Chili's southwestern eggroll appetizer- which I would've spent all of $6 on contrasted to our $14 a burger meal.  Kuma's! We love you. I love you. I love you and your veggie patty and I am hoping that this southwestern, black bean-based shit pile on a bun was due to some kind of vendor error or last resort situation.

2016-03-02,5.0,"Heavy metal hamburgers, HELL YEAH! Given all the hype, Kuma's doesn't disappoint.  Surprisingly small, smoke-filled, and sensationally popular, this Avondale spot serves some of the best sandwiches this side of the Sierra Nevada.  Allow me to give you some background/perspective..... Kuma's has 4,613 reviews on Yelp, which makes it one of the most reviewed places in the WORLD.  It's got more than Wrigley Field (a paltry 1,117 reviews), even more than Six Flags Magic Mountain (one of the USA's largest theme parks, a meager 1,543 reviews), and more still than O'Hare Airport (one of the busiest transport hubs on earth, with a mere 2,392 reviews). So yeah, Kuma's is pretty much king dong when it comes to the Chi-town edition of Yelp. As popular as this place is, though, I've only been here during lunch hours.  The two (or 3?) times I've visited, some indie horror/fantasy movie has been showing on their TV; on my inaugural visit it was Labyrinth (RIP David Bowie, you and your poorly-hidden junk will be missed), followed by 'Lost Boys'.  Most recently, it was 'The Crow'.  Odds are that whatever is playing will get you into the mindset needed to master one of their dozen-plus deluxo burgers. I devoured the Plague Bringer which had an assortment of spicy condiments, including garlic mayo, a jalapeno, hot sauce, pepper jack cheese, and tortilla strips that added a satisfying crunch.  Stellar chips; the lunch special was a 5.3oz patty and perfect size for my modest appetite.  Other burgers are named after a metal artist, album, or song (e.g. Mastodon, Metallica, Iron Maiden, High on Fire [a play on 'Fire on High', a song by the very peculiarly un-metal Electric Light Orchestra]).  The Led Zeppelin features slow cooked BBQ pork shoulder, while the Pantera is highlighted by a roasted poblano pepper. My better half ordered the Slayer, which is essentially an 'un-burger'.  A 10oz patty served atop a bed of fries, chili, cheese, and Andouille sausage.  Definitely not for the faint of heart or light of appetite.  On a separate occasion, I recall their legendary mac'n'cheese hitting the mark, in both portion size and taste.  You can get pretty much any burger topping added to the mac; my recommendations would be bacon and bacon. Bread = 5 Circuses = 4.5 All in all, a damn fine showing from THE most-reviewed business in Chicago (that's right!) and one of the most-reviewed places on the whole freakin' planet.  I'm guessing Kuma's is 8th or 9th, behind the Halal Guys (7.5K, New York), Voodoo Doughnuts (6.2K, Portland), Disneyland (5.7K), and Los Angeles' legendary Bottega Louie with a mind-boggling 12.6K reviews.

2016-01-24,5.0,"After a decade of enjoying the burgers, mac 'n cheese, house potato chips, and craft beers, it's time the original, the one by which all others are judged, and IMHO the only truly authentic Kuma's gets my official endorsement.  Let's get this straight first. This place serves a heart attack on a plate. However, if you're comfortable on your way to heaven via nirvana, then Kuma's is it.  This local tavern come burger joint has existed for a long time. One interesting tidbit about Kuma's is that it was hip before it was hip to be hip. The staff has always marched to its own beat, with plenty of tattoos, beards, piercings, and attitude. Now that these affectations are the coin of the realm, that the bar and wait staff have a sort of 'been there, done that' attitude is merely an earned stripe. At one time, the idea that all of the burgers are named after heavy metal bands and the ambiance is serenaded with the same probably attracted a certain type of music aficionado. Now, it's just part of the charm. I can't tell the difference between the music of Goatsnake from High on Fire, but I can tell you the latter makes one helluva delicious burger. There is a precision to the execution of the burgers here, from the chewy pretzel rolls to the hand ground high quality beef. You're not limited to beef, either. You can opt for a vegetarian patty or a leaner bison patty for for an uncharge. What they put on them, however, puts these things into the the artisanal territory: poblano corn relish, grilled pineapple, brie, poached pears, fried egg, and the list goes on. There's usually a BOTM or Burger of the Month, which just might knock your socks off with creativity. This month's Deafheaven offered me a burger with a full serving of pork brisket, honey glazed brussels sprouts, and frizzled butternut squash. That was stupid good. You can opt for house made potato chips or fries on the side with your burger. Both are done crispy and just a bit brown. The chips are my favorite. Because you might not get enough fat from the burgers, they offer a sinful macaroni and cheese made to order with add ins from carmelized onions, to scallions, to mushrooms or roasted red peppers. The portions are ungodly. If that weren't enough, Kuma's has been a beacon to beer and whiskey drinkers well before the craze went viral. I love that the servers are well versed in which rotating beer selection might best accompany your menu choice. In the warmer months, you can enjoy your burgers on the patio out back. Otherwise, there are perhaps 12 tables and bar seats for the rest of the patrons. Unless you go at an off-time, be prepared to wait, because Kuma's doesn't take reservations. It's hella-good!",0.9934,0.84,0.131,0.029,0.5078943452380953

2016-01-17,5.0,"OMG.  Easy to find, just a couple minutes off the Kennedy from either direction. Parking is tough, typical Chicago with multiple signs that all seem to conflict.  Not a large place, maybe 10+ tables. Heavy metal music.  We were seated under a speaker, yet could carry on a conversation. Not crowded on our arrival, but we were early (~5 on a Wednesday evening) and when we left (after 6), it was still not full.  Fried pickles, mac & cheese, and two burgers were the order of the evening. The menu offers explanations of doneness (rare to well-done, i.e., burnt) and those were accurate to the finished product. Burger 1 was the Neurosis, patty topped with horseradish mayo, sautéed mushrooms, Swiss/cheddar and caramelized onions. Awesome combination with the absolutely wonderful bun. Burger 2 was the Mastadon, perfectly medium-well with bacon, cheese, a not-too-strong BBQ sauce that did not overpower the flavor of the meat. I chose the frizzled onions on the side. Out-freaking-standing. Same bun-we'd love to know what they were.  The burgers come with a potato side, and we had the best potato chips ever. Home-made, they were fresh-cut and flashed-fried before serving. Not heavy or salty, just perfect.  Mac and cheese was not fancy, but a perfect blend. You get two things to add and we chose the blandest, peas and corn.  Our waitress, Heather, was outstanding. Attentive enough without being overbearing. Seemed like a bunch of workers present that night, but it was not chaotic. The only drawback for me was the TV playing an old Schwarzenegger movie. Ditch the TV and the place could be 6 stars.

We decided to visit on a Sunday early evening. For it being Sunday, it was pretty crowded. The original Kuma's location is tiny, but mighty. When you walk in, it does feel like you are in a queue backstage at a Def Leppard concert or something. Luckily, the bar is pretty big and we were able to snag a spot there while we waited for a table.      I appreciated the fact that there was more than one cider option at the bar. They also had a few mixed drinks on special. The bartender was very nice and attentive. We ordered some jalapeño poppers and talked and drank at the bar. I also appreciate the fact that the metal music was not overbearing (unlike the Kuma's in Schaumburg) and I was actually able to hold a conversation with my friends. Lost Boys was playing on the TV, which was a double plus!      We ordered a Mac and cheese to split between the four of us-with andouille sausage, caramelized onions, and garlic. It came topped with scallions anyway so don't waste your ingredient on that unless you want A LOT of scallions. I'm not a huge Mac and cheese eater, but this was DELICIOUS! Enough cheese to stop your heart in 5 minutes. So goooood!     We also ordered burgers. My husband got  the Slayer, I shared the Goatsnake with my friend who traded me half of his Metallica burger. My other friend got another delicious burger, but I forgot the name of it. All of the burgers were cooked great and, of course, were huge and delicious. I think the Slayer will feed someone for 5 days. My favorite burger out of the night was definitely the Goatsnake. Our server at the table was also very nice and was attentive all night. The only slight negative I had for the night was that it was very smoky all night in there (burger deliciousness or fog machine) and after a while my eyes started to burn (since we hung out in there so long).

I came in on a really busy night which was expected because this place actually has awesome food, and was directed to the bar to grab a beer while I waited.  I sat at the bar for 10 minutes with my female friend ( I as well a female) before the bartender finally decided to look up at me from the drink she spent that time making on one drink.  When she noticed us,  she proceeded to yell across the bar to the host if my friend and I were waiting for a table before speaking one word to either of us. When she found out we were waiting for a table the bartender finally followed up (now 25 minutes later) by demanding us, I quote, to ""get the hell up if you are not eating here and you can wait for your goddamned table by the door."" I then then asked politely if it was no trouble may my friend and purchase 2 beers with cash....you know currency we trade for goods? She then proceeded to continue an unnecessary temper tantrum and basically slammed down two shotty over priced warm drafts down on the bar spilling it everywhere in front of me and threw my change at me.

First...if Au Cheval is a ""foodie"" burger....Kuma's is it's 300 lb football player younger brother.  A bit ""meathead"" ... a bit ""in your face""...and impossible to ignore.  The space has a low brow, biker vibe....not many Lacoste shirts or nantucket red chinos.  The waitresses all look like they are on their way to a biker rally (heavy tats, Patty Smyth hair...but were sweet as pie) and Heavy Metal (Slayer and not Poison) is on heavy rotation.  They have a great beer selection (but I am not a huge hop bomb fan so it is PBR in a can for me)....and because it has such a great reputation...there is usually a wait for a table.  We quickly found three seats at the bar...and decided to eat there.  This would end up being a superb decision. We had jalapeño poppers and they were the best I have had....bursting with chorizo and cream cheese with raspberry balsamic dipping sauce.  We didn't take the menu road less travelled and had the Kuma's Classic (sharp cheddar, bacon and egg).  To start...the fries were fresh cut and wonderful.  The burger was big...bold...and cooked exactly to my medium rare request.  A splash of Cholula and a dash of catsup...and it was darned close to perfect.  Did it dethrone Au Cheval....?  No.  It was just as majestic .... but in a different way.  Just like some moods call for David Bowie....and others Van Halen.  Extra points for being pretty affordable....Ronnie James Dio would eat here....and so should you.",0.9699,0.868,0.105,0.027,0.5276881720430108

I didn't like that the buns were not Toasted at all and it was probably one of my least favorite veggie burgers I've ever had.  Just not good...  Flavorless.   3. There are way better burger burger places. I guess if you want a massive burger with tons of meat this is the place for you.  If you want a good,  tasty burger it is not. Kumas is nothing compared to Dmk burgers or veggie burgers (even though they are thinner @ dmk).  4. Everything was just average about the place other than that..

2015-09-23,5.0,"Oh, where to begin. This place already has a ton of reviews, so there's not much more I can add. This is my favorite burger/beer joint to meet up with friends in the city. Yes, the wait can be excruciatingly long, but time flies when they have FFF (Zombiedust!) and whiskey on tap AND you're with good company. The loud metal music and funky art adds to the ambiance. I've tried about half their burger menu, and the only one I didn't enjoy was the Lair of the Minotaur - only because the pear was a little too sweet for my savory tastes. Everything else so far has been fantastic. Their mac and cheese is SO GOOD! Order one to share with the table; it's delicious. Portions are large, so expect to have leftovers unless you eat a lot. And I eat a lot. I don't recommend this place if you have a large party because it will take forever to get a table.  You can order food at the bar, so try to snag a seat there if you're dining solo or with 1 other person. I DO recommend it if you love burgers and beer. Just try it. I've since moved away from Chicago :(, but when I do visit, I make it a point to come here at least for every other visit! I have yet to try their Schaumburg location... it looks like it's easier to get a table there because of the larger space in suburbia, but it definitely looks like a different kind of crowd than what I've come to love about Kuma's on Belmont (judging purely from yelp photos).

2015-09-11,5.0,"Kuma's Corner has received National Attention for it's delicious burgers. I have been reading about this place for years but, the idea of long waits has kept me away for all this time..   As anyone who knows me can tell you, I absolutely hate crowds and hate waiting even more.  A few nights ago, as I was deciding between  going to bed or having dinner, i decided to roll the dice.. Figuring, 10 pm on a Tuesday night would be my bet, i decided to take a run at Kuma's..     I drove up to see from the outside a bar/restaurant that looks like your generic Irish Pub Design.  Nothing special so far, i think to myself.. Well, with all the talk of the heavy metal aspect, i was expecting a blacked out building with a skull and cross bone painted on the outside..     I walk in to see the place pretty packed.. A long curved bar that seats maybe 30 people..  The staff all tattooed, ear stretched and septum pierced.. Death Metal blaring, the place darked out, Friday the 13th playing on the televisions with subtitles.  I am greeted by smiles from the staff.. I take my place at the bar and peruse..      I look over the beer menu and go right for the dedicated Three Floyds Tap.  They have 4 Roses on Tap, they have Jack on Tap, they have several whiskey's on tap.. I am driving, I have no intentions of drinking 4 roses.. Though, I hope someone else orders it just to watch the process. They are serving the Kolsch and Zombie Dust.. I order the Zombie Dust and order their classic burger minus the fried egg.  Right now this place is batting a thousand,  I am so excited for this freaking burger..      The burger is made to order and it's a big patty.. I would guess close to 8 ounces.  You can order the degree of doneness.. I asked for medium rare.. I drink a beer and watch the movie:  The burger comes after maybe 15 or 20 minutes.. It looks pretty awesome.. The first thing I notice is the pretzel bun.. It seems really, really solid as in dense.. A little smushed and room temp...    The fries appear to be skin on and made in house.. They are hot and salty and delicious..  The burger has a ton of melted cheese, criss crossed crispy bacon.. The burger is served with lots of raw onion.. Everything is checking out.   I bite into the burger and it's salty.. Salty in a good way, then you taste fresh ground beef cooked perfectly medium rare.. It's juicy, it beings to pool in the plate.. perfect for dipping the fries.. The bacon is crispy, the cheese is a perfect melty match..  I am a very happy man..  About half way through the burger, i abandoned the bun.. It was too dense and I was getting full... While it was not bad, it certainly was the least enjoyable thing about the burger..  I finish with a knife and fork.. I make sure there is no more burger left on the plate..   To sum it up, this is one fine burger.. The setting is fun.. Especially for someone traveling alone, sitting at the bar.. It's dark, it's loud, there was a great movie on the screen..     I can see this as a regular spot on my Chicago rotation..   Is this one of the best burgers in the country?  I can certainly understand why someone would say that.",0.9952,0.79,0.146,0.064,0.5194304753626788

Got here around 8pm on a Saturday and the hostess said we would only have to wait around 20 minutes. My group was pretty pleased. The first thing I noticed is the heavy metal vibe to this place. It's definitely not for everyone. The music was heavy metal and they were playing some gory movie on the tv. Not for kids. It also felt like the A/C was broken. We first were seated directly opposite from the kitchen, so I asked that we be moved just a little further away so the heat wasn't radiating onto our table. The staff was very friendly and efficient. We ordered some fried pickles for the table, which were good - but had a little hint of spice. My friend and I split the Kuma Burger - cheese burger, bacon, and fried egg - OMG. it was amazing. Really glad we split it though - after doing a food tour of Chicago, I don't think I could have stomached a full burger. The burger was perfectly juicy. Great quality. The menu clearly says: NO VEGAN OPTIONS (kind of poking fun at vegans/ vegetarians - but hey, I get it. What's the point of coming to Kuma's if you don't eat meat!) My friend ordered a chicken burger (She doesn't eat beef) and it came with a salad - which was realllllly good. We couldn't stomach mac n cheese - but I highly recommend getting the mac n cheese - it's supposed to be amazing. I would say Kuma is a great place to go for a casual bite - not for the faint hearted - the decor and vibe is a little intense and not for everyone. I would not take my mom here. Great food though!

I think that the restaurant is trying to discourage or phase out carry out orders because they make it nearly impossible. Out of the five or six times I've called to make an order for carry out, I was only successful once. Each time I've called, it's been in the evening around 10-ish. Although the website says they take carry out orders until midnight, the girl answering will say she can't take my order because the kitchen closed 10 minutes ago, the kitchen closes in five minutes, or we're done taking carry out orders for the night. I even once called during the day to ask the manager, Lindsey, what time they stop taking carry out orders and she assured me I could call any time before 11:45. But still, I called again shortly after 10 the same week, and was told the kitchen was closed. Since they don't want me to order for pick up and it's not worth eating inside, I guess that's it for me and Kuma's.

2015-08-13,2.0,"It really kills me to have to write a sub par review for this location. I know it already has almost 5,000 reviews and all, most which are great reviews, but I feel it best to write an objective review for this location.  My friends and I were craving a burger and since Kuma's is down the street from our new place, we finally decided to give it a shot. We started off with a round of Bloody Mary's which were tasty, spicy and delicious. An order of their Mac n Cheese and fried pickles to share.  First dish to come out was their fried pickles. This dish and the bloody Mary's may be the only contributing factor to this 2 star review. If it weren't for these items, I may have had to give this place a single star.  The fried pickles were amazing. Crunchy, airy and perfectly fried. The pickles were fried perfectly so they held onto their consistency and structure. I believe they use Panko bread crumbs so they were extra crispy. Also the batter stuck perfectly to the pickle. Don't you just hate it when the inside pulls apart from the batter when you take a bite? I do.  Next to come out was the garlic jalapeño and chicken mac n cheese. From the photos and reviews we were expecting some pretty awesome mac n cheese. When I think about good mac n cheese, it's that crunchy crispy buttery bread crumb topping with ooey gooey cheese blend and perfectly al dente noodles. It has the topping but didn't seem to have much cheese in it, felt kind of watery in consistency. The biggest problem was that the cheese sauce they made was completely broken. It had a mealy texture which made it unpleasant to eat. Let's jus say there was plenty leftover.  Finally the most waited for and anticipated item. The Kuma burger. It looked so good on arrival but as we eating I was truly disappointed. The bun weren't toasted, too much bread to meat ratio, don't know why but there were bites that were just so salty as if they had not mixed the meat mixture enough that left pockets of salt in the patty. I could only stomach half my burger.  What's even more sad is that the fries were soggy under salted and just not proper.  Had high expectations for this place. Nonetheless we walked out with tons of leftovers.",0.9935,0.77,0.158,0.072,0.6077271123937791

The bartender got to me super quick and hipped me to the lunch menu. I'm glad she did because I was able to get a very manageably sized burger for a little over 8 bucks. About 5-6 burgers from the regular menu have lunch portions.  Now for that burger! I got the ""Darkthrone"" which had chipotle peppers, pico de gallo, and goat cheese. The pepper and goat cheese pairing was simply delightful and the lunch portion size allowed me to crush my plate. The only thing left was the ketchup.

2015-07-26,2.0,"Came here after a long day of a beach volleyball tournament, starving.  I wanted this place to be as good as it looked on TV, but it turns out it is way overhyped.   Food- We started off with the bbq pulled pork fries.  This was a mess of a dish.  The fries were nice and fresh cut, but the pulled pork tasted like Costco pulled pork and didn't stay on the fries too well.  One thing I enjoyed was the tap root beer.  It was that sprechjer root beer with the bird of the bottle that I've had before, but maybe on tap made it taste better and it sure hit the spot.  It pained me not to order the pantera burger, but chiles on a burger isn't my thing (sorry dimebag).  So I went with the mastodon burger: bacon, fried onions, BBQ sauce, and cheddar, cooked medium.  Unfortunately, the burger was nothing like mastodons music.  The burger was cooked well done, the bacon was fatty, the bun was hard, the cheese had no flavor, and they drowned it in what tasted like KC masterpiece.  Now, the good.  This place gets three stars because it is a great hang out spot, especially for heavy metal fans like myself.  All the burgers are named after heavy metal bands.  Another reason, my brother got the bacon Mac and cheese and it was delicious.  The house made potato chips were also a nice touch.  My dad got the goatsnake burger which came with a buttload of weird ingredients like goat cheese and poblano relish, AND IT WAS AMAZING.  His burger was also cooked a perfect medium, and the party was about twice as big as mine.  I was jealous for sure.  YOU KNOW WHAT.  For consistency I'm bumping this down to two stars.  This restaurant has potential, but they need to get their act together.   Service- Was extremely slow.  Took forever to get our food.  Service was nice just slow. Everyone in there either had saggy tattoos or orange hair, kind of an eyesore.   I would recommend this place to people in the area looking for unique burgers, but don't go out of your way to come here.   This does not do pantera justice.",0.996,0.722,0.202,0.076,0.6885416666666666

2015-07-25,5.0,"I don't care for heavy metal music or gore movies playing on TV. Yet, I don't care, because the burgers here are too good to pass up. My favorite so far is the High on Fire, which has sriracha, sweet chili, roasted bell peppers, pineapple and prosciutto. I know pineapple on a burger sounds odd, but it just works. The burger has always been on point the three times I've ordered it. The fries are hit or miss (sometimes they're overly salty), but when they're a hit, boy they're good. I recommend the High on Fire first and foremost, but other great options are the Plague Bringer (great if you're a garlic fan) and the Absu.  While I do come here primarily for the burgers, several other items on the menu are worth noting. The Jalapeno Poppers in particular, if you're going to order an appetizer - get them. They are stuffed with chorizo as well, and come with a delicious raspberry vinaigrette. They are so. good. The fried pickles are also delicious, and also come with a spiced mayo-like dipping sauce that goes really well with the fries too. What I particularly like about Kuma's is that even though the food is fantastic and there's usually a crowd, they don't try to overcharge.

When I found out that Chicago was home to a place that served burgers AND played heavy metal music, I thought I died and went ""South of Heaven."" Any metal head will immediately feel right at home with the decor and employees. The walls are adorned with pictures of heavy metal greats from Maiden to Slayer. In addition, the menu has items that are named after heavy metal bands. I live in NJ and have been there twice in the past year. The first time I went there I had the Famous Kuma Burger which is a burger with bacon, sharp cheddar, lettuce, tomato, onion and a fried egg on top. It was cooked to perfection and was a masterpiece of cooked meat.  On my second trip, I decided to do an Iron Maiden theme: a few pints of Trooper Ale on tap and the Iron Maiden burger which consisted of a burger with chipotle mayo, cherry peppers, pepperjack cheese, avacado, lettuce, tomato and onion. Absolutely great flavor combo! Aces High!! I went to Kuma's in June both times I visited and it was not only hot outside, but inside as well. They don't appear to have air conditioning, just huge fans that you would see in a warehouse. If you have to wait a little extra time for a table or to sit outside, I highly recommend doing that.

The location of the building is very random. There was a long wait for a table, but there wasn't anywhere to wait outside (it was raining a little bit that night). It was very stuffy and crowded inside. I grabbed a beer at the bar and waited by the windows. Once we got our table, the service was veeeerrryyy slow. I was getting really hungry, which is good I guess since I would be devouring a burger any minute now. It was getting so crowded inside. The whole atmosphere was loud and smoky, but honestly once the burger arrived I forgot all about the surrounding around me. I ate it sooo fast. It was SOOO flavorful and juicy. I ordered the Kuma burger and added mushrooms and pickles to it. I also chose bison meat instead of the regular beef. I always order rare or medium rare for my burgers. I ordered my burger with chips and even their chips were good too. Man oh man this place did NOT disappoint me. The egg on top seriously brought the burger up a notch. Everything in the burger were like meant to be there. This was probably the best burger I've ever had.",0.9784,0.857,0.122,0.021,0.4956150130063173

However we were surprised to be seated within 10 mins of waiting.  They had a huge selection of craft beer and burgers named after rock bands. Since I'm usually indecisive, I asked the waitress what's the most popular spicy burger and she suggested the ABSU. My friend got the Iron Maiden. The burgers come with a side of fries which were crispy (the way that I like it).  While we wait for our food, we chatted over heavy metal rock music blasting from overhead stereos, so loud that we had to shout at each other in order to have a conversation. We started looking around at the decor of the place and it kind of startled us to see artworks of skeletons and demon-like faces. The burgers kind of took longer than expected to come out but it was worth the wait. The ABSU essentially is a burger topped with a piece of friend chicken and other goodies. The Iron Maiden is like burger topped with a half of avocado and other stuff. My only complaint is that the buns could be softer and warmer.  After finishing up, I waited in line for a one-stall restroom. I was appalled to see how much writing and profanity was written on the walls. Plus, the toilet and the floors looks like they haven't been cleaned which made me uncomfortable to use it. Idk, but didn't they say you should judge the sanitation of the restaurant by the cleanliness of their bathroom?

2015-07-08,4.0,"Kuma's offers BIG food for burger lovers. You won't find such juiciness elsewhere. Visiting Chicago, I did my research on Yelp on some of the best eats. Of course I saw Kuma's with it's 4,000+ reviews. Thousands of reviews can only mean that it's popular among Chicago citizens. Furthermore, a good friend of mine raves about this place saying he could eat it every single day if he had enough to afford it.  This was the first meal I had in Chicago and I was shocked by the portion size. You better come ravenous cause there is going to be a lot of food. Since it was my first time, my friend agreed to split a burger and mac-n-cheese with me. You build your own mac-n-cheese here by choosing two toppings. You can choose additional toppings for an additional cost. We decided to go with the chicken and the sweet corn. For the burger, we shared a Mastadon which had BBQ sauce, bacon, sharp cheddar and frizzled onions. The burgers are recommended to be medium although they will do the wellness to your preference. I was very pleased that they will give you exactly what you ask for. Medium is medium and you can see the pink and juices on the inside. Cutting the burger in half felt like a sin but it needed to be done so I could have my half! The meat patty is so meaty and thick. The BBQ sauce is slathered everywhere and I love the texture of the frizzled onions. It adds that hint of onion slice you would get on a normal burger but in it's own fried way. The bun is a good vessel but I do find that it gets a little soggy. Each burger comes with fries. They are so dark that I almost that they were sweet potato fries. The fries are pretty average in my opinion, nothing too special. The mac-n-cheese was delicious! The bowl and portion is giant. I have never seen so much mac-n-cheese in my life. Between my friend and I we only got through half the thing. It's perfectly cheesy in every way possible. I never thought of putting chicken in mac-n-cheese but I really liked the combination with the corn. Each piece of chicken was small enough to be present in each bite, without feeling like you were just eating slices of chicken. I love how the sweet corn added some texture and pop of sweetness to the rich and salty cheese. I would recommend sharing the mac-n-cheese with someone! Service was great. Our waitress was witty and had some humor. Food came out promptly and we were checked up on at the right times.  There is just something really comforting about eating such fatty burgers and ridiculously giant mac-n-cheese.

Street parking was a snap. Service was on point throughout. Scared to order draft because of yelp tips on warm beer. Good selection of bottles. But have no desire to drive back when I have great selections in my neighborhood. Mac and cheese was our highlight. Great texture and tasty ingredients. Worth reheating. The burger...came out warm. Not the best serving temperature compared to other places. Nor when attending a home BBQ. This is a char burger. So the smokey taste helped but not enough. Maybe if I sat inside and inhaled the smoke, it would have added to the flavor profile. The egg yolk was half runny and half done. Did not get the perfect egg. Raw red onions, not my goto. My go to is grilled onions.  Melted cheddar cheese was paper thin. Looked as if someone lightly brushed the top. I need a thick extra ""coating"" so I don't see the base. What is the true ratio of cheese to beef? Could not taste the cheese. I had better elsewhere. The beef. Asked for medium rare. Got some raw spotty meat. So not cooked evenly.  Ate around it. Not forgiving. Sigh. I was not blown away. My opinion is this place is inconsistent. The signature burger should never falter. It should hold up to it's name. Messy to eat but not complaining. I've had messy elsewhere. Pretzel bun was nice. Chips were very dark brown throughout. Nothing golden. Quality control... Fresh cut fries are fresh cut fries. Very salty for my taste. Salt was medium coarse. Tasted of Kosher salt based on my memory. So the fries tasted typical. Now I'm craving Susie's fresh cut fries on Montrose. Not entirely satisfying.

Now, let me back up a few steps.  I've had Kuma's Corner bookmarked for a couple of months now, only to keep drooling until that time came when I'd be able to sink my teeth into the burger.  I've been craving a grandiose burger like a pregnant woman craves pickles and peanut butter so when my fiance suggested that we try out Kuma's Corner I was like ""Oh, hell to the yes!""  I was so pumped and boy, was I ready.  I even had on my kick-ass, perfectly ripped t-shirt that says 'Beer is Food'.  I was definitely ready for this adventure.  I could barely contain all of my excitement while we were in the car, on the way to the restaurant. When we got there it was fairly crowded, but that was to be expected given that we had arrived at around 9 pm on a Friday night during the summer.  Why wouldn't it be busy?  I've heard that this place is always, always, always busy so I was well-prepared to wait for at least 45 minutes.  There was absolutely no way that I was going to deny myself the opportunity to experience this burger!  There were about 4 parties ahead of us and we were projected to have to wait for about an hour to an hour and a half, but the hostess said that we could eat at the bar if we found a spot.  Although the wait wasn't bad (especially given that we had some beers to remedy our waiting time) it was cramped.  Kuma's Corner isn't very spacious, but like I said, no worries because I had my Three Floyd's beer.  Yes, you heard me.  Three Floyd's beer.  I found out that there is always some rotating Three Floyd's beer on draft - my fiance and I were lucky enough to pick from 3 different Three Floyd's beers on tap.  Lucky, lucky us.   While we were waiting we had the pleasure of watching a cheesy 80's horror flick on the screen above the bar and listen to some head-banging, hair-whipping music.  Yes, I did whip my hair back and forth.  It was a very cool vibe in there - perfect for one of those nights where you just don't really give a shit (excuse my french). At this point, you're probably reading and saying ""Yeah, yeah - so what?"" so I will break the beat down for ya.  You cannot go wrong on any of the burgers or food choices.  The only advice I can give you is this: Do not order a burger just for the band its named after, especially if you don't like what's on it.  That may have been obvious, but I'm just putting my two cents in.  My fiance ordered the Pantera burger and I ordered the Lair of Minotaur burger, which was freaking fabulous.  Now, usually I order my burgers well-done (which I'm thinking is a huge mistake), but instead I ordered my burger done medium - BEST DECISION EVER.  The juices of the burger ran all down my arm and it was undoubtedly the messiest burger I've ever eaten, but oh my goodness, it was worth every grease-filled droplet running down my arm.  The Lair of Minotaur has pancetta, provolone and a bourbon-glazed pear on top of it - need I say more?  Oh, and these burgers - they are not for the faint of heart.  They are huge and you will surely have to mentally prepare yourself to eat the entire thing because you do not want to waste a single bite of it!  The fries are also delicious, but good luck eating those if you plan on eating all of your burger.  I advise you to come with a very hungry stomach because there is not a single thing that you're going to want to leave on your plate. Just a note - it can get kind of steamy in the restaurant because not only is it small, but the cooks are also making the burgers right near the dining area/bar.  On one hand, it makes the restaurant smell orgasmic, but on the other hand it makes you want to strip down to bare essentials. Anyways, this concludes my mind-altering experience that I had at Kuma's Corner and I can sleep at night, knowing that I had one of the best burgers in Chicago.",0.9995,0.755,0.198,0.047,0.5454164217127181
2015-06-14,5.0,"I didn't think I was prejudiced, but I guess everyone has blind spots of which they aren't aware. In my case, I came here fully expecting a ""meh"" experience. Kuma's has had so much praise lavished on it that I practically expected there to be an altar there with offerings of singles, EPs, LPs and cowhide. I certainly expected some attitude from the people working there. Wow, what an oasis Kuma's turned out to be on a bitter cold night, if in your book a place that plays metal can be called an oasis. For me? It's situational (especially now that I've caught myself with a pre-judge-ice). Truth be told, I had originally intended to try my first bowl of Ramen at Wasabi. I had borrowed my friend's car for a few days, and the car was happy to humor me with a ride up there on a Sunday evening. With people waiting on the sidewalk and the temperature flirting with negative degrees (that's one optimistic, flirtatious temperature!), I looked at my Yelp bookmarks and saw Kuma's. There were a few people outside, but they were smoking; so I didn't assume that there was a line. When I went in, there were probably a dozen people waiting, and I told the hosts that I just wanted a seat at the bar (classic, old school, to my liking, I might add). The bar was shoulder-to-shoulder, but the host went over to a group in the corner where most were waiting for a table and not drinking. One was more than willing to give me his seat. Kuma's waiting problem solved! In my mind, I apologized for expecting anyone to give me less than front-man, headliner-rock-star. ""HELLO CHICAGO!!!""  Very friendly bartender, and efficient: my Jack on the rocks was in front of me in no time, along with a water back that I didn't even have to ask for. I probably had not earned the right to try the Kaijo, because I had never heard of the band. But if they're music is topped with bleu cheese and ""frizzled onion"" (the rock & roll hair!?!) I like it. Those ingredients are, indeed, part of my rock-'n-roll fantasy. And Kaijo? I just found some tunes on the Interwebs, and I'm listening as I write this, like my songs, on the back of a napkin with some Jack in my hand. Kaijo is another surprise that I didn't expect. It's not head-banging music, or even metal (unless you consider synthesizers metal, which would be like calling pressboard wood... and I love & used to play keyboards. No prejudice there. The burger was excellent, as everyone says, cooked exactly to the medium rare specification. Good fries too. And the onion frizzles? I'll run my fingers and tongue through any rock-'n-roll hair that is that lip-smacking good.

One of the bartenders gave me a menu and walked away.  Five minutes later, I asked another bartender ""sir, can I place a food order with you?"".  With an extremely bad attitude he replied, ""NO"" and walked away.  Even after that, I still wanted to stay and order my food. Waited another 5 minutes, and I saw another server and I asked ""can I order some food?"".  She couldn't hear me the first time, so I said ""can I please order food?"".  She rolled her eyes and with a bad attitude said ""what do you want?"".  Once I ordered the first burger, she asked how I wanted the burger cooked.  I said well done, then her trashy attitude said ""you mean burnt??"".  I was like huh??  So she asked again with her bad attitude, ""so, how do you want the burger?"".  I said are you ok?  She replied, ""yeah so what do you want?"" with a bad attitude again.  I couldn't do it anymore, and told her thank you for treating me like shit and walked away.

My boyfriend and I ordered a couple of burgers for pick up, figuring it'd be easier than trying to get a table. They told us it'd be ready in about an hour and 15 minutes. That is pretty lengthy for just burgers, but we came at the time they said. And I waited. And waited. Our burgers weren't ready for at least 15-20 minutes AFTER the time they told us they'd be ready. When we finally got to eat them, the annoyance continued. I had asked for my burger to be done medium well. Not well done. My burger was burnt to a crisp. It was also pretty flavorless.

On to the food...we ordered 4 different burgers and split them so we could all try them. We tried the High on Fire, Minotaur, Pantera, and Kuma burger. Several of us did not like the pretzel buns at all. Way too dense and hard to bite. The burgers were just ok. Frankly, not much better than Red Robin and not worth the $14 price tag. We also ordered the macaroni and cheese with sun dried tomatoes that was delicious. We also ordered several craft beers that were good. We made sure to try both the homemade potato chips and fries. Both were a major disappointment. The fries were overlooked. We should have seen them back. When other tables received their fries, we noticed theirs appeared to be properly cooked. Some quality control problems there. Chips were forgettable. Could not figure out the ""waffle fries"" nonsense on various posts and the menu. It actually irritated us.

We came here twice, one time on a Saturday and once on a Sunday. Both times we had to wait but Sunday was a much shorter one then Saturday.  The staff here are basically all the goth kids  from your high school now working as servers in a metal music burger joint. Every staff member we encountered was nice though both times so no complaints there.   The food here is my favorite part so let's talk about that a bit.  I got the led zepplin burger which comes with pulled pork on top, I also sub a ceaser which is always fresh and a huge portion.  The meat is delicious.  Perfectly seasoned and fresh everytime. We also had the fried pickles which were good but a lot of breading.  The only reasons I can't give this place five  stars is because 1. there's no air conditioning, so it it's hot you're just screwed 2. No reservations and always a wait 3.

2015-06-05,4.0,"It was like, ""grunge"" central. Frayed jeans, sneakers, flannel and jean vests were sported by (most of) the patrons and the staff alike. On the flat-screen tv above the bar, a very young and pre-politics Arnold Schwarzenegger was in a 90s movie. It was a Tuesday evening, and a friend and I went around 7:30pm and put our name was on the list- the wait for a table, 45 minutes.  The hostess told us we'd have better luck eating at the bar, it's first come, first serve. I heard there's sometimes outdoor seating when it's warm but when I went a few days ago, it wasn't set-up yet.  (Sadly it's still too cold in June.) But anyway, a racing bike was secured to an upside down ""U"" a short distance from the front entrance, the black metal covered in street art stickers. And apparently Square Bar, across the street, opened JUST to take in overflow from Kuma's, so I've been told. Me: I was like ""FINALLY I get to try Kuma's... give me a burger and a beer and I am a happy girl!"" Reading the look from my out-of-town visitor: semi-shock. ""What is this place?!"" This was not her usual scene... but she was a great sport and I PROMISED that Kuma's has ""one of Chicago's best burgers"" so she went along with it.  A fellow Yelper called this a ""pilgrimage"" which I found kind of accurate. Kuma's is a place everyone should go at least once in your life, to taste the burgers for yourself. The hostess kept an eye out for us and once two spots opened up at the left-side of the bar (we were 30 minutes into our wait), she dutifully signaled us to take those prized seats. Those seats, closest to the wall, gave us a little more breathing room, but we were still jostled around in our stools from people ordering drinks behind us.  Though, I live literally, right next to the CTA and ride the train all the time, I guess the jostling was not as bothersome to me.  The BURGERS did not disappoint.   Here's what we ordered: [burger] ""Iron Maiden"" - pepperjack cheese, chipotle mayo, lettuce, onion, tomatoes, avacado  [burger] ""Absu""- tomatillo salsa, pepperjack cheese, red onion avacado relish, quesco fresco, trio of breaded, deep fried chilis (on the side) [drink] Allagash White on tap [drink] Root Beer on tap (pretty amazing with a burger) The burgers alone were SPOT on. (I have not tried Au Cheval yet so cannot compare...). Kuma's menu and its atmosphere is one-of-a-kind.  After we were stuffed, kinda cramped and stepped out of Kuma's into the fresh air, and we both confirmed that Kuma's serves up some amazing burgers.  You might get jostled around a bit, and be on the brink of losing your voice talking over some heavy metal, but man, that was a great burger.

We arrived on a Saturday at 11:45 am and had to wait for 40 mins to get a table for 5 which tells how popular this place is with the locals considering it opens up only @11:30 am. Burgers we gorged on this visit: - Plague Bringer - High on Fire - Veggie Burger  - Absu They have a great selection of local brews and have Whiskey on tap \m/. Each of the burgers come with a selection of home made fries or chips.  Note:  - The burgers are GINORMOUS 10oz juicy patties + Extras .. so bring your APPETITE if you plan on finishing one by yourself. - Both the Chips and Fries are served a bit well-done.. Personally I loved it but can be off-putting for some.. so check with your server if that is not how you like your fries/chips. TIP: Be sure to dip the fries into the juices from your burger patty.. I feel it elevates these Regular fries into Truffle fries ( no pun intended).

But they were more than happy for us to get takeout. I placed an order for two things: (1) Mac & Cheese with Caramelized Onions, Jalapenos, and Prosciutto and (2) the Kuma Burger with Caramelized Onions. I ended up dropping $34. The food had a 80 minute wait, and we waited in the Burger King less than a block down.  Kuma Burger: 4.5/5 -- Wonderful burger. Unmistakably high quality beef with amazing pretzel bread. Like at Au Cheval, the fried egg goes perfectly with the burger. I did find myself wanting more spiciness, maybe some chile, maybe some pepperjack cheese instead. I ordered the Kuma Burger because of the hype. In retrospect, I should have probably gotten one of their spicier and more flavorful burgers.  Mac & Cheese: 4.5/5 -- For the past several years, I have maintained the mentality that mac & cheese is for children. It's just pasta and cheese. Where's the fun in that? But boy did the caramelized onions, the jalapenos, and the prosciutto go excellently together and change my mind about mac & cheese forever.  I couldn't finish both the burger and the mac & cheese.

I really like burger places and I had a hang over so I thought this would be a great place to cure it. When I arrived I had to wait an hour to be seated. That's thing about this place its pretty tiny and there are not a lot of seats available. My party decided to wait because we thought that a place supposedly this good would be worth it. After sitting down and ordering a few drinks and having my burger I was pretty disappointed. I ordered the Plauge Bringer because I like spicy things. The burger I had was just ok there was nothing special. It didn't have a lot of flavor and tasted pretty dry. It was huge and the fries were pretty good too. Now the burger was alright but the price for it just wasn't worth it. Honestly I don't think this place is worth the hype. The interior isn't that great and the food was meh alright. I just can't justify going here again especially if the burgers cost 14 dollars that's just absurd.

Slayer - this thing is crazy looking! 10 oz patty of beef on a bed of fries, and then topped with chili, cherry peppers, caramelized onions, andouille sausage, Monterey jack cheese, green onion and anger. This dish is an awesome and an impressively big pile of food. However, the unfortunate news is that my husband got really sick after eating the Slayer.

2015-04-29,4.0,"Walking into Kuma's Corner, which is literally located on the corner feels a bit like you've been transported to a 1980's rock video. From the dark lighting to the tattooed waiters and the blasting metal music, it's as if you're the lead of the hit rock video.       The line from the outside, depending on the rush, can sometimes be intimidating. When seeing the packed line, I did feel a bit discouraged in trying it just because when something is talked up too much, it never is up to par. People here know Kuma's as the ""best burger joint with the longest line"" so I was told by my group of friends to suck it up. But once we got past the line and were seated on one of the small tables they have that fill up the entire room which don't leave very much space to move around, I forgot about how long I waited. The heavy rock music, meant to be loud enough to drown out the sounds of your thoughts seeps through the speakers, which doesn't allow you to be as comfortable as you'd like. The dark walls with bright paintings and interesting graffiti styled artwork made the already tight space feel cramped, but it was well worth it by the time our burgers were brought out.      The service was crappy. The waiters didn't even try hiding the fact that they despised their jobs and we were sometimes left to feel uncomfortable when asking for a refill with our drinks or even asking for extra silverware. When we sat down, we were informed by our very blunt waitress that the line was long so we should have our orders ready to be placed and should be considerate of those waiting for a table. From the moment you step inside, it's obvious that it's not a welcoming environment. It's set up in a way that makes the customers want to pick up their food and leave instead of sitting down and dining in.       Putting all of that aside we are able to focus on their exquisite burgers, some of which named after famous rock legends. The minute food gets placed in one's mouth all else is forgotten. My all time favorite burger is the Metallica burger, which was placed on the table drenched in the most authentic tasting buffalo sauce known to man with the freshest blue cheese dressing. The lettuce, crisp and the perfect shade of green, was refreshing to the mouth. The tomatoes weren't soggy and you could easily tell the establishment picked from the best ingredients.       I'm not even a big fan of blue cheese and I couldn't have enough. The ingredients, which were equally powerful in each bite, balanced each other with the coolness of the vegetables and the spiciness of the buffalo sauce. The actual meat, not only tender and made to order, was the perfect shade of pink inside since I asked for medium rare.       The burger was the epitome of perfect burger, it looked about 6 inches in height and made you wonder how it was going to fit in your mouth but it was presentable. The fried pickles that we ordered as a side were not only fried in oil, but must have been fried in heaven as well. At first, the crunchy feel of the pickles put me off, and the taste may be considered an acquired taste. My take was that if you like fried pickles you'll love theirs.       Looking back at the experience as a whole, I'm usually one to say that no matter how rich the foods may be in flavor, I do believe that service is just as important as delicious food but this may be the only instance where I can put service aside and go for another burger no matter how unsettling the environment.",0.9962,0.813,0.138,0.049,0.5330448475686571

In fairness, they DO give you a full description of cooking temps on the menu. It's just different than descriptions at other restaurants. I should have believed them!  The service was fantastic and the ambiance is fun and divey. However, I will warn you - they're not kidding when they say it's a metal music bar. A loud one.

2015-04-06,3.0,"Like many of you I came to this place for the first time knowing three things.  They have amazing burgers, they play metal music, the place is small making the wait long.  Well two of those are true.   We went on a Sunday evening and had about a 30 minute wait, which isn't bad apparently.  Upon entering you are present with a dark dingy room.  Immediately you see the long bar and the ATM that blocks half the door.  In addition to the dinginess the vent over their grill does not work nearly well enough which fills the room with both a good smell of burgers and a terrible burning sensation in your eyes.  I've been to plenty of smoking bars and this is something else. We were seated in the back (near all the smoke) and promptly greeted.  If nothing else the service was very good.  We were given menus and a beer menu which is pretty extensive and had many unique beers on it which is always nice.  So I order a beer and the classic Kuma, my wife orders mac and cheese and the Kaijo (blue cheese).  IMO the mac and cheese was nothing special.  She seemed to really like it though.  We both liked the fries a lot while they were hot.  The were well salted and mostly crispy. Now for the burger.  In order of importance to a great burger, 1) The patty was cooked properly, but unremarkable in anything other than its giant size.  Little to no seasoning and was squished into a mold though not terribly tough. 2) The bun.  Pretzel buns need to go die in a fire.  They are good at one thing, holding an enormous burger.  The don't taste good, they are too dense, and they are too big.  3) Toppings, the cheese was good and melty, the bacon was crispy, and the egg was cooked correctly to ooze the yolky goodness.  The veggies were just ok but perhaps that's what you get in winter.  All in all a very decent burger that was ruined by the bun.  Even with a good brioche or kaiser roll it would still just be decent. All in all, I'll probably bring a guest in town for the atmosphere and novelty, but that's about it.  This is not the place to find the best burger you've ever had, or even just a great burger.",0.9912,0.794,0.154,0.052,0.5397867063492064

I finally made my way in there after driving past it for a year and a half. I didn't go for the same reason I didn't go to Hot Doug's.

2015-04-01,5.0,"Having the week off from work, cabin fever &  a rare 70+ degree April day made me decide to FINALLY scratch this place off the bucket list.  I'd been dying to try this for years.  After hearing about all the horrible waits (and having tried to go before to only have a 2.5 hr wait), I figured a weekday lunch would probably have the least wait time.   I got there around 11:45 after circling the area for 10 minutes to find parking.  I parked in the Burger King the next street down, throwing caution to the wind & thinking I should be good for the 1-2 hrs lunch may require.  I walked in expecting a wait & was told if I wanted a table, it'd be 15 minutes or I could sit at the bar.  I decided to sit at the bar as I was alone.     I was handed two menus, one for beer & one for food.  There were probably 50 or so beer choices  & about 13 burger options.  I was quickly waited on by a very friendly, tatted & pierced bartender. As I had driven an hour  & was off work, I had a beer.   My beer (2 Brothers Ebels Weiss) and water both came quickly.  Having studied the menu ad nauseum, I ordered the Mastodon (BBQ sauce, bacon, cheddar, frizzled onions) & fries.  Figured I'd stick with a basic before going for fancier burger for the first time.   Tip:  if you go M-Fri for lunch, they have a lunch special where you can get a small list of burgers for $5 which are about half the size of the normal burgers.    I waited for about 15-20 minutes for my burger & took in all the ambience, complete with Mortal Kombat movie on the big HD TV. The place is just as I'd read about:  small with about 10 tables and maybe 10-15 stools at the bar, hot  & loud.   It was hot in there, even with the door open, but not ungodly hot.  After a cold winter, it felt kinda nice actually.  It's also loud.  I was actually disappointed since I was expecting the music to be the loud part but the crowd was louder than the metal music I wanted to listen to.  So, be forewarned.   As I waited for my food, a friendly regular sat next to me with some advice:  1) Every burger is awesome 2) it's best to come at lunch during the weekday.  If you come on a weekend,  come in small numbers so you can minimize wait time by eating at the bar &  3) determine what matters most to you, the food or the ambience.  If the food is a bigger priority, go to Kuma's Too, their satellite location.  It's larger with same menu & little wait times.  If you want the true Kuma's ambience, be prepared to wait.  I also asked about Lockdown, which I'd read also has burgers just as good if not better as Kumas'.  He said Lockdown burgers are great but Kumas are better.  I'll try to experience Lockdown soon to see for myself.   OK, enough rambling.  Onto the grub.  The Mastodon was damn near perfect. EASILY the best burger I've had in Illinois & right up there with the Cherry Cricket burger in Denver.    It was at least 8 oz, big soft fresh pretzel bun, perfectly cooked bacon & very crisp, crunchy onion frizzles.  The BBQ sauce was very tasty as well.  Could've used a BIT less of it.   The burger was cooked to a perfect medium.  I was hoping it'd be a little juicier, but I was stunned at how savory & perfectly seasoned the meat was.  The burger came with a big pile of fries, which were piping hot & drizzled with sea salt.  The fries, after about 5-10 minutes to become cool enough for me, were very tasty as well.  Nice, hot, soft and a little salty...just the way I like them & my women!  As my meal was about over, so was my beer.  The waitress asked if I wanted another.  Fearing a possible tow and gastric distress on the commute home, I asked for my check & a t-shirt from the place since I love the logo...and the grub.  My check was completely taken care of within minutes.  My full belly & I waddled happily down the block to see my car was still there...and it was.  All in all, an excellent experience.  The only downside was the hour drive to & from the place.    If it wasn't an hour or so drive, I'd be here ALOT more often.  That awesome of a burger & fries for $13?  BARGAIN!!   However, I'm told a Kuma's location is opening in Woodfield Mall in July, which will not only be significantly larger but significantly closer (30 minutes).    I cannot wait!",0.9987,0.805,0.154,0.041,0.5648663997501207

The burger portion was huge and more then enough fries to feed two people. My favorite part of the Pantera besides the patty had to be the tortilla strips, there's just something about that nice crunch that just satisfies the taste buds. And if you thought the burger was huge you haven't ordered the build your own mac and cheese yet. We build one with caramelized onions and andouille sausage and it completed our meal. The mac and cheese was the right cheesiness without being too heavy, yum. Being a party of 6 we had to wait over an hour plus, however, the only 6 top they had opened up, but instead of giving it to us (the only party of 6 waiting) they gave it to a party of 3 who could of easily waited another 10-15 minutes for another table instead of making us wait the extra 45 minutes. This did not make sense to me and what got me more upset was the fact that they were going to turn the table next to the 6 top we just sat down in, into another 6 top, which they could of done for us this whole time.

Personal anecdote time: I headed out to Kuma's as a single diner to relive a great culinary experience. The place was full, but not with a line out the door: upon arrival, I was next in order to get a seat. The hostess said I should take a seat at the bar once one opens up. Apparently the same instructions were given to the next three or four people who came in and grabbed single seats at the bar before I could. I asked the hostess for some help but got none. I came to eat good food, not to have to hunt and fight for a seat so I could be served. After 45 minutes of waiting patiently while I kept getting passed over for service, I had enough and left.

2015-02-17,5.0,"I've loved Kuma's ever since my first Lollapalooza music festival several years ago and was also overwhelmed with sadness when they stopped participating in the festival... but I digress. I had quite a bit of time to kill during my last trip to Chicago so I decided to drop by and grab a burger (or two) to go for my flight home. The thing that sets Kuma's apart from every other burger joint is the super awesome pretzel bun. SO. GOOD. I decided on the ""Led Zepplin"" and the ""Plague Bringer"", which were vastly different, much like the bands they're named after. The ""Led Zepplin"", much like its namesake, was softer around the edges with Southern comfort flair. It had Bacon, Slow cooked Pork Shoulder, BBQ Sauce, Sharp Cheddar and Pickles. It felt like you were hanging out in a friend's backyard with cold beer and watching football. The pork was super tender and flavorful as it was slow cooked for days, the BBQ sauce had just the right amount of tangy-ness, and bacon... well... duh, it's bacon, what's not to like.  The ""Plague Bringer"" was like a punch in the face, but felt really good. It had Roasted Garlic Mayo, Crushed Garlic, House-made Hot Sauce, Jalapenos, Tortilla Strips, Lettuce, Tomato and Onions. I'm a big spice head so the house-made hot sauce and jalapenos really spoke to me. The burger was amped up with flavor and the tortilla strips added a great textural contrast akin to adding fries to a burger. Pure awesome. Overall, the service was friendly providing some helpful advice and the food is face-melting good. I actually ate the ""Led Zepplin"" at the airport before my flight and ate the ""Plague Bringer"" for dinner when I got home. You know a burger is good when it lasts about a 3 hour plane ride and still tastes incredible. A burger here will change your life forever. *Drops the mic*",0.9968,0.743,0.213,0.044,0.4954131652661063

The Mac and cheese (I added scallions and Andouille to mine) was probably better than homemade baked macaroni. The burgers were huge with good buns and fresh toppings. The only offnote for me were the handcut fries - but I generally don't care for handcut fries anywhere because they don't get crispy. Service was very good and very fast. Everyone except the hostess was very friendly.

No, I had never been there, but I had been hearing about this place for a long time and, as a burger and metal lover, I knew this was a place I had to try. We came here without a reservation (they don't take reservations, so don't try) with the expectation that we would be waiting a while. I think we waited maybe 15 minutes tops when we were quoted a 25 minute wait, so that was great news. We leaned on the windowsill while waiting, which is what everyone else did, too.  We took our seats at the bar and perused the menus. I opted for the plague burger, but it was a tough choice. Whenever my dad comes here, he orders twos burgers. One for now and one for later. This time, I just got the one, but no promises about next time. My food was amazing. My fries were amazing--perfectly crispy and salted. The burger was sweet, succulent, the meat was cooked to perfection, and the bun was delicious. I have big hands and the burger was a handful. My poor girlfriend couldn't even bite into hers. She ended up taking off the top bun and eating her burger with a fork and knife. My beers went really well with it, too. I don't even recall what I ordered now, but the list is extensive and well-organized. There's definitely a drink for everyone here, though I'm officially recommending a beer (or two or three) to go with the burger and fries.  The metal music playing in the background wasn't invasive. It added to the metal head character of Kuma's. Honestly, I'm really glad we trekked to Avondale to experience the original as opposed to Kuma's Too (wherever that location is). Also, you've got to check out the bathrooms. There are lots of pics of scantily-clad women and graffiti, creating a unique aesthetic that is completely fitting with Kuma's overall.

2015-01-09,5.0,"Let me preface by saying, I love burgers.  And metal.  I've eaten a LOT of burgers, some good, some bad but this was AWESOME.  I saw this place on Food Network and, travelling to chicago pretty regularly, decided I had to check it out.   We had a party of 5 20- and 30-somethings on a Tuesday during the holidays around noon.  They don't do reservations so we put our name in and went to a bar down the block (Square Tavern which was also very nice) for a beer.  We came back and had to wait in the tiny waiting area for about 20 minutes yet but, hey, there was metal so it was cool.  It was almost the atmosphere of a concert at a small bar.  Original artwork on the walls and kind of crazy to see young parents with young children here.  We loved the Kuma's Corner album covers which copied some well known albums like Pantera's ""Cowboys from Hell"" and Metallica's ""Master of Puppets"".  There are very few tables but the wait was well worth it.  Considering the number of people, once we were seated, it didn't feel crowded (enough room at the table) and the service was excellent.   They're known for their build-your-own mac and cheese appetizer so we added prosciutto, bacon, and andouille.  We had two certified mac and cheese addicts in the group and we all agreed that it was just incredible (could have done without the andouille, it was overwhelmed by the lovely smokiness of the bacon).  One appetizer was plenty for the 5 of us. It was so amazing that I've made it my goal to replicate it at home, no matter how long it takes.  Creamy but still gooey and the smoke was just gorgeous.  Velvety and beautiful.  Bravo.   I ordered the PlagueBringer burger which was cooked perfectly medium, on a brioche roll.  The highlights of the burger were the meat itself (I have a sneaking suspicion that they grind their own meat, the texture was just so beautiful), a roasted garlic aioli and sliced fresh jalapenos.  And the fries.  The fries are delightful.  Perfectly crispy and nice dark golden color with kosher (not table) salt.  Not a burned or undercooked fry in the bunch.  Truly a work of art.  I am a big girl.  I had to take half of my burger and some of the fries home.  I can't tell you the last time I took a burger in a doggy bag, if indeed ever. My husband ordered the Slayer burger which forgoes a bun and just puts the beef patty on a pile of the same bad a$$ fries with a pretty good chili (the one place I thought the food could be a little better. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad but compared to the rest of the food, it was just good), pickled chilis, cheese, and, according to the menu, anger.  Again, burger was perfectly cooked, overall wonderful with some nice heat (he said he found the anger when he bit into a particularly toasty chili :) and those amazing fries.  Again, so much food that he ended up taking half of it home.  Needless to say, we had a leftovers party later that evening. This guy's been working on his food a long time and it shows.  All of the sauces were housemade and really thoughtful for a metal/burger joint.  Great beer selection and whiskey on tap.  Prices were quite reasonable.  Overall, well worth the wait and highly recommend.  We plan on making this a regular stop on every trip to Chicago, though we might try Kuma's 2 next time.",0.9991,0.709,0.23,0.061,0.574240399662935

When I discovered their delivery service over the summer I got to relax and eat this food without long lines, small quarters and loud music.  During winter hibernation sometimes I get the desire for a giant burger topped with creative ingredients like poached pear and brie (Lair of the Minotaur Burger), or roasted garlic mayo, bacon, gouda and roasted red pepper (Yob Burger). And after gorging on their food I always feel like I can take a three month nap.  These burgers are built to withstand the end of the world, their size yields enough to get me two meals (or share with someone, that's your call). I once left them a note asking about how pink my burger would be if ordered medium rare and they gave me descriptions to inform future ordering (The answer is ""super-pink"", and no, medium-medium rare is not an option). I appreciate their good communication.  They usually quote a 90-120 minute wait for delivery, about the same as if you were to go wait for a table. But it's always a pleasant when they surprise me after only an hour and I didn't have go anywhere. My favorite thing about Kuma's is the fried pickles. If I could eat just these pickles for the rest of my life and turn my blood into that spicy sauce... I think I would die the happiest woman ever. I'm not sure if they coat the pickles in magic fairy powder, but they have texture and spice that's oh so nice that I can't find anywhere else in Chicago.

Went Saturday around 3pm thinking that I might be in the window between Lunch and Dinner and the line wouldn't be long. NOPE. Got there to see a large group of people waiting and a 45/1 hour wait. While waiting I noticed that the hostess did a good job of letting people know when they were up next or if she saw people signing their checks at the bar (as it is first come first serve). It was definitely appreciated and a nice touch. After being seated (about 45 min in), it was time to eat. Along with the Kuma's Burger, I ordered a Black Plague IPA, a beer that was specifically brewed for Kuma's. It was good but nothing special.  The burger, on the other hand, was very good. It's a huge with a full egg, two strips of bacon, cheese and a juicy burger if you can find it. Not my favorite in the city but right up there.

The breadcrumbs and scallions they add on top made it slightly different than just basic Mac n cheese. The noodles were cooked al dente, which was a good touch! Not too salty; better when hot sauce was added (sriracha, to be exact). 3/5 stars. I got the Lair of the Minotaur which had Brie cheese, prosciutto, caramelized onions, and poached pear on top of a well cooked medium rare beef patty! Sounds delicious? It was!

The door staff is always so rude, they will randomly close their kitchen early and not give you a table an hour before they are about to close, they refuse to let you in if you forget your id at home, even if you're not going to drink, and never crack a smile. The burger patty is delicious and now that I've turned veggie, they have a fantastic veggie patty. I've just gotten to the point that the food is not worth the treatment from staff.

Whether it be the heavy metal music in the background that never stops playing, the service, location, and especially NOT the burgers. All around Disappointing. This place was on a list of really good restaurants recommended by a server from one of my fav restaurants, so i wanted to check it out. Was also told to avoid Kumas Too and come to Kuma's Corner, since it's THE original. Look at the number of reviews for this place?! After waiting for over 2 hrs, i thought, everything would be worth it as long as the burgers are good. After all, it's about the food. I had the Iron Maiden, and also tried my bf's burger, they were bland, patti lacked juice and texture, gross.  I will not be returning. If you want good burgers and skip the wait, goto Bop n Grill or The Bedford. I'm no burger snob, but i had my bf's burger at The Bedford; it was delicious. He is a burger snob and says that was the best from the 15+ burger places he's tried in the city. Warning: background music is loud ass heavy metal which makes it really hard to talk. What else am i suppose to do when i have to wait at least an hour for this place and it's 30 degrees outside if it's impossible to have a conversation without yelling?

Finally,  don't go to Kuma's if you're vegetarian. If you want a nice big burger paired with exceptional toppings,  be sure to check out this place. You will not be disappointed.  On this visit, I chose their Goatsnake.

So when I found myself in the area by accident on a random Wednesday, I decided that I had to stop in and get a beer and burger to see if it lived up to all the hype.  Holy crap this burger is amazing! I ordered the Kuma's burger. A fried egg on a burger isn't anything so unusual these days but Kuma's does it best. The egg is perfectly cooked and perfectly runny. When I cut my burger in half (because these things are massive, people!), it was quite satisfying to watch that yellow yolk just ooze out. The meat is beautifully seasoned. Just salty and flavorful enough without overpowering the meat. And bacon, of course! Would this be complete without bacon? I hardly think so. The house cut fries deserve a little love too. Yum! Although the person next to me was having the house made chips and those also looked delicious. So tough decision to be made there.  So why only 4 stars you ask? The music is so loud in Kuma's I nearly shrunk right out the door after I opened it. It is an assault to the ears when you first enter. You get a little used to it when you are sitting in there (a little!), but it is L-O-U-D. So if you have a really important conversation you want to have with your friend or boyfriend, this is not the place to go.

I'd been wanting to try Kuma's for a long time, but how often do you want to schlep to Avondale and wait multiple hours? Came by with Walann R., Katie R., and Liz B. and were quoted an hour. Kuma's is even smaller than I imagined, but our wait only lasted about 45 minutes before we were seated. I can't even imagine the wait times during peak meal hours or weekends. Monday at 1:30 PM was a good choice. Our waitress came over right away with the beer list and menu. She was very helpful and attentive throughout our meal. After choosing from Kuma's extensive beer list, we also decided to go with the mac and cheese for an appetizer. It had come highly recommended from friends and did not disappoint. We added corn, sundried tomatoes, and (obviously) bacon. This dish came in a huge portion and the four of us had no chance of finishing it. Solid item to split before your burgers arrive. For lunch, we all went with different items and were all thrilled with our choices. I split the Led Zeppelin and Plague Bringer with a friend. They were both fantastic and complimented each other well. First, the Led Zeppelin has tender pork shoulder on top of the burger with a really tasty BBQ sauce. Simple and delicious, cheddar and pickles this one out. On the other side of the Kuma's spectrum was the Plague Bringer. So much garlic, but in the best way ever. This patty was also cooked to perfection and topped with the regulars plus hot sauce, jalapeno, and tortilla strips. All of these components added an insane amount of flavor and it wasn't too spicy. It's also worth nothing that the buns that both of these burgers came on were sturdy enough to hold it together, hugely important.  Overall, go to Kuma's at an off-hour for a phenomenal meal. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and will definitely be back, as this is potentially the best burger I've had in Chicago.

Love the pretzel buns and meat cooked medium rare. It's was so juicy  and dripping all over my fingers. The mac and cheese was good too but it was huge. Only one thing I didn't care for was the tenders since it was on the dry side.  I enjoyed our bartender/server, she was so nice even though she was busy. She gave us as much attention as possible since I told her we just landed and we were starving. She was quite the character and kept us entertained throughout the night. And after our flight back to Cali, my grouchy friend said ""Man, I hella want that burger from Kuma's now"".  If in Chicago, come here. Awesome burgers and craft beers.

I've read about it, heard about it, and every Chicago guide says you HAVE to eat here if you're in the Logan Square neighborhood. Well, its not the BEST burger I've had in the city but it was pretty darn close. First, lets be clear, Kuma's Corner is not in Logan. Its in Avondale. So be prepared for a hike if you get off at the Logan Square Blue Line stop and expect it to actually be close. Regardless, that had no bearing on my review. I thought the burger was well cooked and the staff awesome. Our waitress was incredibly entertaining. She didn't seem to mind when we joked around with her about being first time patrons. They had a great beer selection. I'm not much for the ambience (metal) but that's just not my thing. I went for the burger and the beer.  I tried one of their classic creations at the request of the waitress. It didn't disappoint. We ordered one of their mac and cheese dishes as an appetizer. The mac and cheese was UHMAZING. Not just amazing, UHMAZING. It could have fed the two of us without having burgers after. The fries are made in house and definitely worth the trip. Ask why they don't have waffle fries. Its one of their favorite questions. Overall, Kuma's definitely has a burger worth checking out. I gave it four stars because their is no where to wait (and you will ALWAYS wait,) and the kitchen isn't well ventilated. I HATE smelling like a restaurant after only being inside for 5 minutes. The whole place was under a cloud of smoke from their grill in the back corner. I'm sure this is part of the ambience, but its not my cup of tea.

Additionally, the burgers are big enough to feed two people easily. I was pregnant at the time and still could not put a dent into any of the food.  There are many burgers to choose from. They are all named after heavy metal bands. I had the Mastadon which was very good. The combination of bacon, fried onions, and BBQ sauce was great. My husband had the Yob, which was pretty underwhelming. The ambiance is not very the faint of heart. It's pretty hard core rock metal that plays over the speakers.

2014-10-13,2.0,"With great expectations come great disappointments. Before my Chicago trip I was thrilled about going here after seeing all the great pictures on instagram.. Unfortunately I had to learn the hard way that filters lie, and some people are just great at taking pictures of mediocre food.. Aside from the mediocre food, this place had horrible service. I don't know if it was because we sat at that specific table by the door but our waitress barely noticed that we existed. We'd make eye contact, flag her down and still we were ignored! She filled up 2/3 water glass and decided the third one was too far to reach so she just walked away without refilling... NOT okay! If we're stuffing our faces with arteries clogging food, we should get reasonable amount of water to wash it down. Now for the food.. I felt like I fell victim of false advertisement. The newspaper on the wall next to our table said that the meat/burgers here was what sets Chicago food apart from the rest. That sounds promising. However after eating our food, if this was what's considered phenomenal &stand out-ish - then please, give me back what is mediocre and mainstream! The burgers were indeed huge, saucey and messy to eat. Usually those are key adjectives that makes my mouth salivate but after the first bite I was hoping this burger would be smaller as I didn't want to waste so much food. I ate half of the Plague Bringer and I was underwhelmed. The meat patty was tender/juicy but I feel like all the ingredients just did not mix well. Maybe it was my fault for not ordering the right things. For specialty burgers Slaters 50/50 in Cali definitely tops this.  We also ordered the make your own mac n cheese, the portions were HUGE. Between 3 girls we weren't able to finish the serving. It wasn't mind blowing but it was good, especially with sriracha.

I don't. I really don't understand the fascination with this place.  Every now and then I bump into a place that is extremely popular and I can't understand why.  It's almost as if it's a perfect storm of a place that is trying soooo hard to be edgy and unique that it attracts this mass of people that are desperately looking to discover a place that is edgy and unique.  Those sheep continue to trumpet their discovery without taking the time to realize that the place is very average or just flat-out sucks.     How can anybody tolerate screeching death metal played at level '11' for more than six seconds?  And, no, I didn't grow up listening to my Hanson and NSYNC cd's, I grew up listening to punk rock.  Still, I found myself begging for 'Mmmbop' to hit the airwaves to give my ears a rest.  I can't be alone on this one.  I can imagine only a VERY small percentage of the population loves (or can even tolerate) death metal so it's an interesting choice of music when trying to get patrons to your restaurant -- and then to stay and want to come back.  Apparently, it's an atmosphere a hell of a lot of people enjoy so, what do I know?  Kudos, Kuma's! The food . . .  I started off with some Jalapeno Poppers and, honestly, they were the highlight of the meal.  Filled with chorizo cream cheese and balsamic raspberry dipping sauce, what's not to love?  Well . . . the burger. I think where I screwed up was my burger choice.  I went with the Plague Burger which was not a very good burger.  When putting the menu together somebody needed to say, ""Okay, we're trying too hard here.""  The tortilla strips were just ridiculous.  Very large tortilla strips that dominated the burger and fell all over the place the moment you tried to reach for the burger.  I simply had to remove them because they really had no place on the burger.  Hot sauce, garlic mayo, crushed garlic, jalapenos . . . What was I thinking?!  Why didn't I just play it safe with the Kuma Burger?  Hell, the Iron Maiden looks EXACTLY my speed!!  How come I didn't even notice that on the menu the first time around?  I guess I asked my server what the most popular burgers were and Kuma and Plague were here response.   Nevertheless, no matter what burger I ordered I would have been severely disappointed when I saw it arrive with a pretzel bun on top.  I think a pretzel bun is something you either love or hate on a burger.  Personally, I think the bun makes the burger.  And I can't stand pretzel buns on burgers.  I like my burgers simple.  Sometimes people get creative with burgers and it works.  A place in Scottsdale,AZ (Rehab Burger Therapy) has an incredible burger topped with pulled pork and bbq sauce and it's outstanding.  The Plague Burger?  Nassomuch! I wanted to like this place, I just didn't.  My two-star review will get lost in the sea of four and five-star reviews and I'm okay with that.  I'm glad other people like the place.  I've got nothing against the place personally.  My server was . . . adequate.  I just didn't care for the atmosphere or the food.  Two fairly important factors on determining how much one likes a restaurant.",-0.8242,0.762,0.117,0.121,0.5923744113029829
2014-10-02,5.0,"During the three months of planning, two friends and engaged in for a trip to Chicago for the yearly Alehorn of Power festival, one thing was forgotten until the morning of the concert: Where to eat.  With a multitude of choices, mainly culled from various cable television travel programs, we were overwhelmed, indecisive...until another friend from back home in Pittsburgh messaged me. ""Are you guys going to Kuma's?"" she asked. ""That place is too metal NOT to hit up. If you guys don't do Kuma's while you're in Chicago, you're lame."" ""A-HA!!!"" I exclaimed with a fist in the air. I had remembered Kuma's from ""Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives"" as ""that metal restaurant"" but had forgotten which city it was located in.  Furthermore, it was on the way to Reggie's Rock Club, where that night's show was to take place (some of the other places we considered were too far out of our range, and Chi-Town is large).  That was it. We had to go. The zeitgeist was calling to us.  A 45 minute drive from Rosemont, and from there, a 10 minute walk resulted in us being confronted with a obelisk of burgundy brick and grey stone, one that resembled Tessaro's, our own burger haven in Steeltown. Soon we were out in the appropriately windy (whoever gave Chicago its nickname wasn't kiddin' around) street conversing with other metal fans from other states who were also in Chicago for Alehorn of Power... youtube.com/watch?v=MmAt… After an hour-long wait that felt like... youtube.com/watch?v=JDCg… We would be seated by a tattooed woman with black, thick-rimmed glasses who resembled a librarian that fell in with a pack of earthdogs and hellrats... youtube.com/watch?v=lVN_… Once we stepped into the tavern of aged wood and gothic chalkboard scrawlings, we were seated underneath a picture of our favorite band's classic line-up: Adrian Smith, Dave Murray, Nicko McBrain, Steve Harris, Bruce Dickinson (no, not the obscure Blue Oyster Cult producer! take your cowbell and stuff it!)... youtube.com/watch?v=r9dW… Our jaunt began with a serving of Kuma's Jalapeno Poppers. A sextet of golden, crunchy panko-breaded ovals, each popper was an exercise in exquisite contrast not only in regards to texture but also in the oozing filling of cream cheese and chunky, piquant chorizo. Another clash of flavors and tongue sensations occurred with the accompanying dipping sauce, a balsalmic jalapeno raspberry jam, which merged sweet, sticky, tangy and fiery into a lacquer that coated the taste buds with bombast.  All three of us ordered the Iron Maiden burger, of course, but immaterial of the fact that it is named after that legendary group, it had enough going for it that I would have went with it even if it had been called the Coldplay. And it wouldn't be. Not here, thank the gods. Never, Ever. Surrounding a deftly prepared medium-rare, eight-ounce buffalo patty were a brigade of embellishments that included chipotle mayonnaise, cherry peppers, pepperjack cheese, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and onion. Once again, there were foils to be found. The chipotle mayonnaise itself was both stinging and creamy. The cherry peppers' heat was simultaneously extinguished by the juicy tomato. The smooth avocado played off the bitter snap of the onion like drummer and bassist... youtube.com/watch?v=FSor… All of us also opted for housemade potato chips in lieu of french fries, and they were as immaculately, consistently crisp and seasoned as any I've ever demolished with my teeth.

The cook on the burgers was good, but a touch overdone. I will just order rare next time around. Everything was creative and delicious. Even the salad had a special basil vinaigrette.

2014-09-10,5.0,"Q: How do you know a burger is good?  A: If you have romantic fantasies about it every night for the 9 days post-consumption then it's safe to say that it was a mighty fine meal. I've had Kuma's bookmarked since 2012, but the opportunity never presented itself to actually visit. After I heard Kuma's was awarded Best Burger in the USA by the Daily Meal, it was mandatory that I finally see whether this was true or not. I'm obviously wiser now, but pre-Kumas trip, I talked about how stupid the people at Daily Meal were because it couldn't possibly be that good. (I said I'm wiser now, but I apologize to both Kumas and Daily Meal for doubting them both.) My first time at Kumas, I went for the fried pickles and the Famous Kuma. The fried pickles were fantastic -- primarily because the batter was so thick and consistent, that it crunched when you bit into it. Sometimes the batter just ends up a sloppy mess, but theirs were perfect. We waited a loooong time for a table that I was starting to question whether I really wanted to stick around. However, the host and server were so nice to us and the food was fantastic, so it was worth it.  I've actually had Kuma's a total of 3 times now: Famous, Yob, and the August BOTOM Agent Orange. My favorite is the Yob so far, but I haven't found one I've been disappointed in.  My 2nd and 3rd time eating Kumas, we've done carryout and been so happy with our food, even after having to warm it up a little. Kuma's Corner definitely has my favorite burger in Chicago and possibly my favorite burger in the entire universe. If you have to wait, hang in there.

2014-09-08,5.0,"Kuma's Corner is a tiny metal bar turned gourmet burger destination, the unlikely champion of Chicago's Yelp scene. I'd hesitate to recommend it if you're not really into tasty burgers--you'll endure a headache and a half before you get to eat. If you are really into tasty burgers, though, Kuma's is worth a little stress. The burgers are awesome, and they come with a wait, but no attitude--the staff is friendly and it isn't their fault that the kitchen is an itty bitty box.   Matt B. and I went with Tristan C. and Brian G. for an early dinner on a hot, humid Tuesday night in July. We had just enough time to order beers at the bar before a table opened up for us on the patio. Apparently this short wait time was very atypical, a result of the unpleasant weather. We got our fair share of suffering after we sat down. We didn't get our burgers until a full hour after we ordered, and we were completely at the mercy of the miserable weather. (For the record, it was even hotter inside.) Our waitress was pleasant and reasonably attentive, so I can't complain too much about the service. Just know that there's probably no such thing as a hassle-free dinner at Kuma's. We kept ourselves entertained with a series of beers off the extensive draft list. Matt and I drank Left Hand Milk Stout, Iron Maiden Trooper Ale, Greenbush Anger black IPA, and New Belgium Snapshot wheat ale. It was all pretty great beer, and necessary stalls for our burgers. We also had a bit to eat right away. The four of us split an order of mac and cheese loaded with garlic and prosciutto, and this came out almost an hour before the burgers. The mac was pretty epic, cheesy and flavorful and loaded up with both add-ins. Some of the best mac I've had, and I've had my fair share. By the time the burgers came, we were so tired and overheated that it was actually difficult to eat. I am ashamed to admit that I was barely able to make it through a quarter of my burger. Very sad, because I could tell it was delicious, even though I couldn't physically bring myself to put away a heavy burger in pre-rainstorm Chicago summer humidity. Kuma's does fantastic burgers, with beautiful juicy patties on soft but sturdy pretzel buns. Really some of the best burgers you're likely to find anywhere. I had the High On Fire, which came topped with sriracha, roasted red pepper, prosciutto, grilled pineapple, and Mae Ploy sweet chile paste. The sweet and spicy elements were just right with the savory deep meatiness of the patty. I wish I had this burger in front of me right now. With my AC on, I'd eat the whole thing in ten bites. My husband's Mastodon was another great burger, a Kuma's standby with bacon, barbecue sauce, sharp cheddar, and frizzled onion. Next time I'm in Chicago, I have to go back to Kuma's and avenge myself on these burgers. From what I understand, the usual experience involves a long line on the front end, and a much shorter wait time when seated. In any case, I'm prepared to suffer once again for these burgers. I just need to be in better shape to devour them when they arrive.",0.9965,0.746,0.175,0.079,0.5285280339628166

I ordered the slayer which I HIGHLY recommend to people. Impossible to finish in one setting though.

2014-08-29,3.0,"Having recently moved to Chicago, I was really excited to check out the food scene of this beautiful city. One of my first foodie adventure happens to be at Kuma's Corner. My friend drove me so we had to circle a few times to find street parking (free). We put down our name for a table for 2 and the waitress said it would be about a 30 minute wait. We stop in front of the store and chilled while we waited for a table. This was on a Friday around 7 PM. The wait time was pretty accurate because we were seated within the 30 minute mark. Like everyone else has said, this place greats pretty loud and there's no AC so it gets pretty hot and stuffy. Towards the end of dinner, we hurried to get out of the restaurant because it was so hot and stuffy. I ordered the Iron Maiden burger while my friend got the Kuma's original burger (both $13 and comes with a side of fries, chips, or salad (salad was an extra $3). Our food came out about 10-15 minutes after we ordered and I began to chow down! The fries were good, seasoned, soft and but nothing too unique that I haven't had before at other burger places. The ketchup was delish! I think it is homemade or something because I notice the ketchup had tomato seeds in it. My Iron Maiden burger with the patty medium rare came with the famous pretzel bun, avocado, onion, tomato, lettuce, pepperjack, and a few other stuff. I think the best part was the pretzel bun which was a bit sweet tasting and kinda did taste like a pretzel but less chewy. I thought the meat patty lacked seasoning and flavor. It was quite bland. Overall, it was not one of the best burgers I have ever had. The atmosphere was dimmed lighting but each other had a light above it for a little bit brighter viewing of their food. Total bill for 2 burgers was about $35 after tax and tip. Service was great and our waitress was attentive. If you are visiting Chicago and don't have a lot of time, I can safely say you can skip out on Kuma's Corner. You won't be missing out on much.",0.9943,0.85,0.142,0.008,0.5409391534391533

When we got seated, I noticed that the wait staff was heavily tattooed and definitely had this whole heavy metal theme going on.  Kinda cool.   Two of our friends got carded when ordering drinks, and I asked the waitress without thinking, ""I don't need to show ID, do I?""  It's been a LONGG time since I've been carded, and she just said the other two peeps looked young and didn't bother to card the rest of us.  Haha. We shared the fried pickles and jalapeno poppers appetizers among the four of us.  They were good, but kinda spicy. Of course I had to get a burger here, but it was difficult to choose between all the mouthwatering burger options.  I finally settled on the Pantera burger because it had Monterrey Jack cheese, which I've been missing since moving to Switzerland 5 years ago.  It had housemade ranchero salsa, bacon, shredded Monterrey Jack, roasted poblano, and tortilla strips, and was served next to a ginormous greasy mountain of french fries.  Major heart attack on a plate, but super yummy. I washed everything down with a bottle of elderflower cider, and it was so yummy that I ordered a second bottle without thinking about how many calories were in it.  Well, I was eating a grease pit of food, so I guess the extra 200 calories wouldn't have made that much of a difference.  :P The burger was delicious...  huge, beefy, and tasty.  I loved all the flavors from the toppings.  Despite being the piggy that I am, I couldn't finish the whole thing and had to bring half of it home.  Overall, the food was really good, but the fries were way too oily.",0.9956,0.794,0.178,0.027,0.48937908496732035

The Chipotle Mayo tasted like thousand island sauce, and I only received a few pieces of jalapeno for heat, though there was a generous portion of avocados on it.

2014-08-08,4.0,"Finally got the chance to try Kuma's with a friend last night. We stopped in around 820 for a later dinner and was told the wait would be around 35-40 minutes.  We opted to grab a drink at a bar across the street (less crowded), and by the time we returned our table was waiting for us.  The ambience is definitely a little different (heavy metal music blaring on the speakers, similar genre art and knick knacks adorning the walls) and I liked the themed menu items (all burgers are named after heavy metal songs I believe). We ordered a round of beers and I had the plague bringer (roasted garlic mayo, crushed garlic, hot sauce, jalepenos, tortilla strips, lettuce, tomato, onion) and he had the special of the month (called the code orange with tortilla, chorizo, and some other tasty toppings). Fast forward 45 minutes (and another round of beer) till we got our food.  Normally I would have been near fainting with hunger and at least moderately grouchy for such a long wait, but I hadn't seen my friend in months so we had a lot of catching up to do and the wait didn't seem as bad. As the many many prior reviews confirm, the burgers are awesome. Great meat, delicious toppings, and the pretzel bun is the piece de resistance. Fair warning the burgers are LARGE (but not so much that they are unwieldy) and I ended up taking nearly half of mine home to go (yes it is in my work fridge right as I type, waiting for me to devour it during lunch). The food is great, the ambience interesting, and the price moderate. If you are willing to wait a bit for your bit of burger heaven, Kuma's is a great spot to check out.",0.9944,0.797,0.173,0.03,0.5311556329849012

I'm not a big fan of burgers (in life) but I will eat a burger when I am here. People who know me know that says a lot about the place. And the long line says a lot too.  The burgers are roughly $12-13 but as I have said already, they are really large. When I eat here, I'm full for the rest of the day at least. There is a variety of burgers with awesome toppings. I wish I could try them all. I've tried the classic with the egg and the black sabbath. Those two are phenomenal. They bring a side of fries and the bread they use is just awesome. I'm also a big fan of their house salad and the mac'n'cheese. For about $14 you have a two topping Mac and cheese for the entire family.  The servers here are really nice as well. They make it a duty to make sure you are satisfied and always check up on their customers. I appreciate good service.

2014-07-31,5.0,"It's December of 2013.  The fogger machine fills the room with a thick, dense cloud; you hear the opening riff from AC/DC's 'Thunderstruck'; and now you feel your leather bomber jacket slide onto your body with all the comforts of your youth.  No, you haven't traveled back in time to your 80's-kid self.  You simply are LIVING the inspiration of the best burger experience in Chicago.  You are living the dream. Kuma's is the one place in Chicago where you will literally get any number of pre-arranged combinations or a build-you-own burger with the highest quality.  I somehow had escaped the dreary onslaught of Holiday parties that leads into Christmas, New Years', and the misfortune that follows drinking nearly every single night this time of the year.  While there, I experienced the TRAGIC GOODNESS of the 'Led Zeppelin' burger, and my buddy experienced the Slayer.  Halving our burgers so that we each could try the others' entrée and repeat visits have eventually resulted in the only logical conclusion: every one of their burgers is amazing.  Duke burgers are the only competition in terms of unique combos, but then the fries here put that argument to rest.  As for the immediacy of this December visit, hold onto your boombox. REMEMBER, I said ""best burger EXPERIENCE""!!  This place properly cooks a medium rare: seared outside, pink inside, a little bit of blood...and gives you the EXCELLENT SERVICE that you deserve. Let's talk ambiance.  While we were there, the girl you & I grew up pining over with the ripped jeans, trashy T-shirt, and sexy badass attitude wants to bring you a beer and give you a little sass.  The entire environment is a somehow unsoiled, industrial version of how the movie Maximum Overdrive--in full personification--would have decorated a restaurant, with diamond-plate steel adorning the walls and metal/hard rock albums also mounting the walls while blaring overhead.  It gets even better; just keep reading. HIPSTER FREE!!! This is the one place in Chicago that absolutely touts this moniker.  No way some douche-bag Yeti or some unkempt Bucktown Broad would set foot in this place.  Those of us that are already containing the hipster menace to certain neighborhoods can come to Kuma's for a brief respite from the battle, knowing full well we will not be badgered or cajoled by some uneducated, trust-fund degenerate wearing an ironic T-Shirt, Converse Allstars, and a seatbelt buckle bag....but I digress.

Disclaimer:  I met lots of nice people in this place.  The girls serving and one of their regular customers were very nice to me, helping me plan my route around the city.  My rating is solely for the food.   Kuma's burger - a big chunk of meat topped with bacon, sharp cheddar, fried egg, lettuce, tomato and onion.  Here we go.  I asked for medium rare and that's what I got.  It was very greasy and too salty.  I also asked for a side of fries and it was sprinkled with sea salt.  The fries tasted like they've been soaked in salty water or something so the sprinkling of salt was over the top for me.  Maybe the burger would've tasted better if I had it with beer.  Maybe I had too high of an expectation.  Suffice to say, I've had better. This is a great hang out place with friends.  Be ready for a big crowd if you're going between Thursday - Sunday.  Hard core rock music.  The air smells of greasy food.  But the people were very nice.  Too bad.  I'll pick In-N-Out over this one.",0.9723,0.83,0.128,0.042,0.4703094017094016

Once we got to our table, the service was good - our waitress told us up front that a well done burger would take 35-40 minutes so we changed to medium.  Appetizer dish of fried pickles is a neat idea and it hit the spot as we waited for the main course. And then the burgers arrived... unfortunately mine was pretty much a disappointment.  Ordered a ""Plague Bringer"", it had a ton of stuff on it but nothing really stood out in the taste department.  Overall, it was too salty, and way too greasy, the buns were thoroughly soggy halfway through the burger.  Can't tell you much about the quality of the meat or the cheese as they were both overpowered by the toppings and the fixings.

If you anticipate having to wait, it is not a big deal as across the street is a nice bar that is not very crowded and offers a fine beverage selection. If you are just going to pop in to Kuma's forget about it. Ok, on to the beef! The selection and pairing of the beef to bun to toppings is well thought out. The meat is seasoned well and cooked exactly to order. Good fries and other sides, I think there is a little bit of something for everyone. To be honest I just don't feel anything about Kuma's and writing this review I feel really nothing about Kuma's that makes me excited to write this. I mean the burger is good, but it does not evoke much emotion or soul. There is no shortage of character, but it is not very engaging and the feeling of ""welcome"" is not on the menu. I understand the attitude is a big part of the appeal but I think I would prefer Kuma's burgers be the star rather than the character of the decor.

2014-07-20,4.0,"Finally made it to Kuma's and it lived up to its reputation, though perhaps not for all the reasons everyone seems to rave about. Three huge positives stuck out for me about Kuma's: 1) Ambiance - the whole metal, dark bar, loud music, burger names, wall to wall tats, anger as an ingredient thing is definitely working 2) Pretzel Bun - this thing is genius 3) Bourbon on tap - always a good move and an impressive selection of 5 whiskeys I walked into the place with my 11 year old (hey, the kid's got to learn sometime) and his comment about Kuma's was ""This is a bar fight waiting to happen kind of place.""  Not only is this an apropos comment about the overall vibe of the place (it's actually pretty benign, and weirdly family friendly) but how awesome is it that he came up with that comment?  I think I get a gold star for good parenting just for that.   The burgers were terrific, though perhaps not transcendent as many other reviews indicate. I had the Led Zepplin (Bacon, BBQ Pork, Cheddar, Pickles) which was good though for my return visit I'll go with something other than BBQ Pork - not enough textural contrast with that.  My son had the Kaijo (Bacon, Bleu Cheese, Frizzled Onion).   This was an excellent burger and the crispiness of the frizzled onion added an important note to the whole thing. I will spend a minute on famous pretzel bun.  IMHO this thing is the reason that Kuma's burgers are awesome.  The Kuma patty is good, but the buns are awesome.  It's crust adds important ""pop"" but not so much that biting is hard - the hamburger does not slide out from under you when you bite.  This is no mean feat and Kuma's is to be congratulated.  It's also got enough body to hold up to the mound of ingredients, but not so much that the bread overwhelms the experience.  In the Yin and Yang of burger and bun, Kuma's is the king. The one thing I was underwhelmed with is the fries.  They were limp and not crispy.  I ate a few but mostly left them on my plate.  You need a big fry, with big texture, to stand up to a burger like this.  Unfortunately these did not. I almost busted Kuma's down to a 3 based on the fires, but the Bourbon and Tats puts them over the top for a 4.  It's a lot of fun and a great burger.  Fun for the whole family, and if your family doesn't like it, it might be time to get a new family.",0.9967,0.801,0.164,0.035,0.5814520202020202

Ambiance is basically a really dark hipster bar with horrible ventilation.  As I mentioned before, they like to make their fries in-house.  Well, this results in a smoke-filled, sticky, swampy, humid bar.  We arrived one hot Sunday evening to find a gigantic industrial-sized fan at the entrance, blowing in some fresh Belmont avenue air :/ In terms of food, we ordered the fried pickles, vegetarian burger ""Lair of the Minotaur"" (brie, poached pear, and carmelized onion), and vegetarian burger ""Goatsnake"" (goat cheese, corn relish, and fried onions).  Overall it was yummy food, but not outstanding.  Certainly not outstanding enough to get 5 stars (sorry).  I was excited about my Lair of the Minotaur burger, thinking it would transport me to some sort of magical French-ey burger land with the brie and pears.  Sadly, after the first bite, I got a mouthful of curry spice, WTF?!  Definitely not what I was expecting.  Perhaps they poached the pears in curry rather than bourbon.   I don't know if I'd go back, there are lots of other outstanding veggie burger places in Chicago...",-0.4448,0.811,0.106,0.082,0.6218390804597701

The veggie burger here is great!

Seating area is intimate, music is loud, drink selection is great, back patio is really nice, as long as you don't end up in direct sunlight mid-summer.  The Iron Maiden with veggie burger is the best, in my opinion. They do a new Burger of The Month (BOTM) and there have been some amazing ones in the past. Follow them on twitter or Facebook to keep up with the rotation. Prot-tip: You can get a regular burger, grilled chicken or the veggie patty substituted onto your burger selection.

A couple month's back, I came here with a small group of Chicago natives with the understanding this would be a great place to eat.

We simply just wanted to have a quick meal for someone's birthday and that resulted in one colossal disappointment. It's an enticing atmosphere as an avid fan of all varieties of metal.

After their burger was declared ""best in America"" my friends and I were determined to disagree. Mockingly, we called it the ""worst burger in America."" Boy were we proven wrong. More on that later. After a nauseating 45-minute circular trip around Avondale, cruising around for a parking spot, we finally landed a few blocks away. Between everyone waiting to get their last taste of Hot Doug's, and the circus outside Kuma's, there wasn't a plethora of parking. Once we arrived we gave our names and waited. And waited. And waited and waited. It would seem that Kuma's has inadvertently turned into a theme restaurant, despite its best efforts to remain true to itself and its rock and roll roots.  The other folks waiting for their chance to sample a bit of burger heaven became characters in our fantasy. There was the blonde girl who got there just before us. Buff Asian Guy and his pregnant wife, and so on. Somehow, Buff Asian Guy sneakily secured two seats at the bar and were seated way before us. Kudos to you, Bro.  So after about an hour wait, we were taken to a table. Our waitress was super friendly, and so was the hostess, despite the mugginess and smoke-filled dining area.  First stop on the menu was the fried pickles, which were divine. Definitely best in America there.  Sadly, beyond the pickles, it took another hour for our burgers to come. So clearly, the kitchen cannot keep up with the capacity of the dining room. That's disappointing, and I think they should work on that by either limiting the seating, or figuring out a way to add on to the kitchen. Our wait became tedious because despite having great company, the room was hot and uncomfortable. Tho we were able to hear one another despite the loud rocking soundtrack. So I disagree with those who think its too noisy. The burgers eventually arrived and yes, they tasted great. We ate our words, and the tasty burgers. What makes them good is the quality of the beef, I believe. You can taste the meat in every bite, it's not just there like at some places where you get a tasteless burger with a bunch of bullshit piled atop it. All the flavors work well together.  I didn't care for the soggy fries that accompanied it. I'm a crispy-fry fan, but to each their own. Courtney C. was happy to finish mine for me.  So the ""best burger in America"" held up against any doubts we had, and this ""doesn't wanna be"" theme spot, was way cooler than I imagined.

I have tried those other places but never Kumas, simply because of the outrageous lines that rivals it's neighbor Hot Doug's ( r.i.p). Wanting to try it I wen early in the morning. Now that I have, let me tell you my experience The atmosphere is very different from others, and that makes it unique and adds to the experience. The patio is quite and a nice parallel to the inside.  The service was phenomenal and it might change depending on the time you go. Because when the servers just start working, they're happy. When they're tired, obviously they'll be a bit more under the weather. The burgers are fantastic, enough said. I had the Led Zeppelin which should be considered an abomination, but it's a fantastic piece of food art.  My friends enjoyed the Classic Kuma burger and the Metallica. They both loved them.

However, the beef itself was on the dry side and surprisingly, the entire ensemble had a flavor profile that was best described as lackluster. Sadsies. One thing that I must commend Kuma's for is their glorious mac and cheese. It is a work of art, completely oozing with cheesy goodness. Many places end up serving grainy cheese, an inevitable consequence of baking. But these guys got it figured out...also allowing a variety of combinations (bacon, sun dried tomatoes, corn, etc etc).

The first time I went I was still new to living in the US and was pretty overwhelmed enough. The heavy metal/ grunge music took me by surprise and I ended up undecided on a burger I wanted because the menu was so extensive. I ended up getting a burger that had pear and goat cheese on it thinking it would be good, but my tastebuds said otherwise (just my preference) So I was pretty let down even though years after people constantly raved about. I guess I was just not having the right burger for my taste and decided to give the place another shot.  A month ago I went and kept it simple, I had the kuma burger done medium and the mac and cheese. I really realized that I did not choose the best burger my first time around and the kuma burger was absolutely delicious! The meat was soft and crumbly than hard and tough to chew like other burger places. It was easy to chew and the mac and cheese was amazing too. They have extremely large portions so the mac and cheese is really shareable among a group.  Decor is awesome and its pretty cool to hear some music other than the top 40 charts or jazz. The service took a while though which made our stay very long and I felt bad for the other people standing and waiting around for a table, as it was during the dinner hour.

Since Kuma's was on the way from one hotel to the other, we decided to pick up take out on the way. We called about 10 mins before we left downtown to place our order. The famous kuma ($13) - Bacon, cheddar, fried egg, lettuce, tomato, onion with house made chips. I know I got take out, so the burger was kinda warm, but I couldn't get over the untoasted bun. I don't know if they forgot, but the bun crumbled as I cut into the burger. I ended up eating it without the bun. The house made chips were delicious! Nice and crispy and salty! I kept eating them even though I was full. Slayer ($15) - 10oz burger on a bed of fries, chili, caramelized onion, andouille, peppers, monterey jack, scallions. This was huge! There was too much going on though. The burger and the andouille didn't really blend together well. Add the chili and it was just too much! Maybe if everything was hot, the flavors would have blended better.  Mac and cheese with Broccoli and Mushrooms ($14) - Another huge dish! I don't know why, but I kept craving Mac & cheese while in Chicago. This didn't disappoint. I just wished it was warmer, so I could get that gooey-ness that comes from melty cheese, but that's the price of take out.

2014-05-06,2.0,"My experience at kumas .......it was decent, good even but some things were lacking.  First up fried pickles , the pickles were perfectly fried and the Breading was everything you hope for in fried delights. Crispy, crunchy and great flavor. But the pickles had no bite , there was no acid taste or dill. So it was more like eating fried zucchini which of course is never a bad thing but we were hoping for pickle.  We also ordered a custom Mac and cheese. We chose andouille sausage, tomato and scallion. This Mac was out of this world. I was very impressed. But the thing is for me, I like my food hot and my drinks cold. The Mac was barely warm. The top layer of cheese was hot but underneath the Mac was room temp at best. It was still great. But for me would have been worthy of going back for if served hot.  To be fair it was freezing in the restaurant. When we took bites of pickles you could see our breath and heat from pickles in the air.  We finished with the neurosis burger which boasted horseradish and mushroom. The burger was huge. But I am not a fan of these giant patties of beef. I think several thin patties make for better bites. But the beef was great and perfectly seasoned.  I didn't get the bite of horseradish at all except in maybe one bite of the burger.  We were sharing and my better half said he did taste it so maybe it was just me. The only bad thing about this burger was the mushrooms. They were cold. They had good  flavor but cold mushrooms on a burger end up just being a slimy afterthought. So I was a bit disappointed. Also , truly the fries were awful. Some were soggy and cold and others were burned. They were all shriveled up and seemed to be the bottom of a batch of fresh cut that soaked too long. We didn't even eat them. Very disappointing. The server and employees were all awesome, attentive and it was a fun atmosphere.  To me, this would be a bar I would go to drink heavily at and the burger would be a bonus as well as the Mac. But I don't think I would go back for just the food. To me the fries and the temp of the food was a deal breaker.  I'll stick to au cheval for my burger cravings. But if I lived nearby I would order the Mac for take out.  Hovered between two and three stars. But for the price it was not anything special.",0.9985,0.719,0.227,0.054,0.6673650793650794

I'm really lucky I live on the Brown line. Just hop the train to Belmont and thumb a cab. About $5-$6 later you're at the door of one of the most original eating experiences I have had in Chicago. It's a metal bar, which I'm used to, an amazing beer selection, also used to, and an eclectic menu of ground beef mastery, Which I was not used to. I have had the first two one at a time but never all brought together into one place. If you're on the fence give it a chance.  The beer selection is bursting at the seams with diversity.  They didn't have any beers like Pabst which I didn't understand at first but I honestly think it would take away from the whole experience. They bring flavors together in their menu that are enhanced by their amazing beer selection. No complaints about that.  There is Whiskey on Tap. Which was also a first for me.  To sum it up, No Crap on Tap. Everyone that works there is amazing too. They kinda blend in with the crowd. Every time I walk in I confuse the woman taking names at the door for someone waiting for a seat. Even though it's always packed they are incredibly accommodating. You're gonna wait. First thought, ""Is it worth it?"" Every second.  My first time there I got ""The Slayer"". I had met a couple at the bar who were there after seeing the same show. We bought each other a few rounds and ended up sharing. ""The Slayer"" is a hot mess. A hot, delicious mess. The best ingredient being ANGER. I couldn't finish even half of it. I took it home and well my dog got into it while I wasn't looking.  She seemed just as pleased.. The next time I got ""The Nail"" which was the monthly special at the time. Serrano Chile Paste Bacon Mint/Basil Chimichurri Pulled Pork Smoked Gouda Fried Mint Garnish  You really can't go wrong with any of their monthly specials.  From there I got ""The Plague Bringer"" which is my ""go to"" burger. Try it..repeat.  Then enter ""The Ghost"". The best ""Damned"" burger I've experienced thus far. I even had a reporter ask for an interview amid the ""scandal"".  Hi Chris!  I'm writing from Good Morning America. We're doing a web story on Kuma's new Ghost burger, which I saw you commented that you were going to try. Did you try it? Would you be willing to chat with me about it for our story?

On a Wednesday. - small space + continuous smoky haze from open grill = dingy atmosphere and you're smellin like a BBQ yourself - slam-metal music only amplifies how wrong a two hour wait is - gross dominatrix-gore style art (with fake bare boobs no less) on the walls - rigidly enforced rules that simply take away from your dining experience (I assume to minimize hassle for the staff). No to go orders allowed- ridiculous because the ambiance sucks so hard - the staff was rather rude and unaccomodating  - the fries were meh - expensive for a burger but no points lost due to large size and quality.

The atmosphere is just as everyone says, dark and cramped, with really loud and annoying hard rock music blasting through the speakers. I am not fan of hard rock music but the atmosphere sets Kuma's apart from the multitude of other hamburger restaurants in Chicago.  The food was delicious, my hamburger was cooked to the right temperature. I asked for a burger cooked medium, and that was what I received. In my experience most restaurants always over cook beef. The french fries were nice and crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and slightly salty. I had the Black Sabbath burger, which has chili, onions, and cheese, it was delicious. The toppings did not overwhelm the flavor or great texture of the meat. For appetizer we has the fried pickles, I highly recommend them.  The service was great and everyone enjoyed their meal.

2014-03-11,5.0,"One of my friends, who is also pretty good friends with my sister, was visiting over the weekend, so I knew I had to prove my hosting abilities. However, this hosting experience was a bit different than others. Not only did I want to be a stellar host, but I knew making my sister jealous by eating/doing all of her favorite things would be an added bonus and extra fun. Enter: zebra wine (shout out to Trader Joe's!), brunch steak and eggs (Birchwood Kitchen FTW!!), and burgers. And that's where Kuma's Corner comes in.  In my opinion, the original locations of restaurants are usually superior to following openings, so we headed to Avondale for Kuma's Corner. It was a Monday night at around 8 PM when we got there, and there was NO WAIT!! A couple of tables were open, but we decided to sit at the bar since my friend and I are both fans of chatting with those around us. The bartender was extremely nice and made beer recommendations to us, let us sample a couple, and we settled on the Three Floyds' Gumballhead - it was delicious, a wheat ale with a strong hint of citrus. In the end of this harsh winter, it made me feel like I was basking in the summer sun. Apparently, their Three Floyds' tap rotates every month. Although, I'm scared that if I came back in summer, would the beer on tap remind me of winter and 6 inches of snow piled on my porch? Gosh, I hope not.  We then set to order and asked the bartender for her favorite burger. She said it was the Iron Maiden and we were sold - chipotle mayo, pepperjack, avocado, lettuce, and the works. It was delicious. The beef patty was juicy and thick, the avocado was plentiful, and the chipotle mayo was delicious. We also decided to order The Slayer, and boy it slayyyeddddd us. It was a deconstructed burger on a bed of fries, chili, sausage, cheese, green onions, and more. It was basically a heart attack on a plate, and believe me, if I had died after it, at least I knew I would have died happy. Although I love me a regular burger, I've never had anything like The Slayer before and I loved it. It was a mix of fries, nachos, a burger, and more. Everything I love came together in perfect harmony. I seriously can't stop thinking about it. The wall art is fun to look at, the beer is great, burgers left us full and happy, and the service was good. It made a great end to a great trip for my friend, and the pictures we sent my sister of the burgers left her a tad jealous. Goal accomplished.",0.9989,0.677,0.259,0.064,0.6000447227191414

I asked the waitress what she thought of Russian Circles and what her favorite was, and it turned out she liked Plauge Bringer for the heat as well. She made my decision easy and she was right.  The burger was off the charts delicious. Fresh Jalapenos,a garlic sauce and crushed garlic with a hot sauce that completed the dressing. The tortilla strips I feared would make this burger more of a ""Mexi-burger"" but I was pleasantly surprised that it wrapped up the flavors nicely and worked perfectly with the rest of the ingredients.

Big fat bun, perfectly toasted, with a smooth delicious flavor of its own. Pretty giant burger with a thick layer of goat cheese. Studded with corn from the relish, which provided a nice tangy contrast to the rich goat cheese. Couldn't taste the vinaigrette, but the frizzled onion offered that nice textural crunch.

I had to stand up and wave the bartender (a young hispanic lady , must have been new)  down to get my beer , she never once after that came around and asked if we were ok , she did take our food order but other than that she hung out next to the kitchen and bs' d with people, and the few times she walked by me , she ignored my empty beer glass and went back to her spot by the kitchen every time I needed a beer I had to stand up , and walk down the bar to wave at the her,  this pissed me off.

Also, best macaroni and cheese anywhere, ever. Avoid the BLT, it is delicious yes, but has something like a half pound of bacon, which is greasing it's way through your pores before you leave. The object of good food is not to feel completely disgusting afterwards, unless you're in a herd of velociraptors, taking down a large herbivore on the grassy plane. Then, bloody and disgusting is perfectly acceptable. On that note, I feel the same thing would happen to a herbivore (i.e. vegetarian) who happens to graze unknowingly into the den of meat worship that is Kumas.  ...I digress, great burger bar, great atmosphere.

The vibe proved to be the wrong fit for my parents who found the whole music-blaring, dark atmosphere and questionably-named menu items a bit alarming. Definitely will be more mindful with who I bring here if I come back... Whoops. We were seated, greeted, and given a round of water right away and it took us a minute or so to get our orders figured out. We had the Lair of the Minotaur (caramelized onions, pancetta, brie, bourbon-poached pear), Black Sabbath (onions, pepperjack, housemade chili), Mastodon (BBQ sauce, bacon, cheddar, fried onions), and the Slayer which is basically a patty hidden in a boatload of chili, cheese, peppers, and sausages. Even though the place was half-empty and had servers just standing around, our food still took quite a while to come out and when it finally did only 2 of our 4 plates were still warm leading me to believe that the first 2 were prepared faster and just sat under the warming lamps. My Lair of the Minotaur ended up being almost room-temperature and it really did take away from the flavor of the burger (though the bourbon-poached pear is a good touch and added an unexpected sweetness to each bite). The Mastodon also came out cold and tasted just like any other burger which is disappointing for its asking price. The Black Sabbath and Slayer came out hot and our table ended up sharing the Slayer. It's just way too much for one person to even try to devour. I also wasn't such a fan of their fries or buns. I felt like it was so much bread to get through. Three-stars for not exactly reaching the expectations I had set for this place.

No matter how busy, they always seem willing to chat -- but never at the expense of service. Prices on their burgers (which are named after various bands) range from roughly 10-15$, but with their great size it's almost like ordering a truck full of beef with delicious toppings.

The burgers are okay.  Most of them are piled with so many toppings you can not really taste the meat.  The meat tends to be dry.  This may have passed for a good burger when they opened in 2005, but now there are more food establishments that source their meat locally and offer better quality.  Better quality can be found elsewhere without the long wait. They encourage people to eat and drink locally--support the community, but we couldn't find any information on the beef they serve or the source.  There are plenty of local beef farm options that we were surprised Kuma's does not offer.  Kuma's staff definitely has an attitude, particularly with their beer.  It's great to have knowledgeable staff--they can educate your clients...who would consume more.  They don't seem to care about the sales, just letting you know that they know more about burgers, beer and music. Our house knows good beer--we are homebrewers, but we don't feel the need to tell everyone, and we are not offended when people prefer Bud or national beers, or if people are simply unaware of local brews.   They always have a wait--I think they continue to ride on their reputation and the convenient location for many locals.  (If I lived down the street I would probably eat there more often....if the attitude was toned down--it was amusing the first time...it's just gets old after that.)",0.9877,0.836,0.145,0.019,0.48189964157706094

Question: If you specialize in burgers, should you not focus with zeal on getting them out of the kitchen the way that your guests requested? Answer: Yes This is not rocket science.  Guest asks, restaurant gives.  This would be slightly more forgivable if the kitchen was under noticeable strain.  The kitchen was not under any strain though as ours was the only order hanging.  Instead it translates in to lack of focus on the guest experience, lack of training, or lack of concern.  Whatever it is, it sucks.

I went here in the winter for my roommate's friend's boss' husband's birthday (got that?). What a lucky man. It was a really good idea going with a few people (there was 4 of us), because it's that many more dishes that you can try to grab a bite off of. So we each got a different burger and then shared a big thing of mac and cheese. Note, that their mac comes in large portions, so it's perfect for sharing or for ordering for takeout alone on a rough night. The burgers that made a lasting impression was Lair of the Minotaur (caramelized onion, pancetta, bourbon poached pears, and brie) and Mastadon (fried onions, bbq sauce, cheddar, and bacon). Birthday Boy got the Slayer, which was commendably manly, but it's pretty much a huge burger casserole that I wouldn't choose over a bunned masterpiece. Still good though. The one thing I will admit, is that I'm not crazy about pretzel buns. I realize it's the latest sandwich trend, but I'm not feeling them. I would rather fill my gut with juicy red meat than dense dough.  BUT -  THE MAC AND  CHEESE. Though the burgers are well above-average, the mac is the highlight. We had caramelized onions, bacon, and peas in ours. And I thought I was going to cry. It's so sinfully delicious that I think I have romantic feelings for it. The depth of cheese flavors is like any other, and the pasta was cooked perfectly and the cheese remained gooey. Order some if you like awesome food. The only downside is the area and the parking. They have a very very small lot where I've never seen an open spot. And it's pretty far outside the cities. Maybe check out their Kumas Too location if that's closer for you.

It was packed when I got in at around 9pm, but I was lucky enough to snag a seat at the bar. First thing I noticed was that this place has WHISKEY ON TAP. WHAT?! You can bet, I was knee deep in Jack and Coke before my meal even came out. No shame. I was on vacation. Anyways. I took a look at the menu and had a hard time choosing, but I decided to go with the Kuma Burger - it had bacon, a fried egg, tomatoes, cheese, and onions, all on top of a pretzel bun and a medium rare burger patty. This burger is freaking huge. Like Slater's 50/50 huge, where I had to cut it in quarters in order to get a bite in. The burger was amazeballs. I've never had a burger on a pretzel bun, but I think that was my favorite part of it. The fries were good too.  Service is pretty good. The bartender serving me was super nice.

2014-01-20,4.0,"This is a good burger. The wife was craving a chicken burger (ungrounded and unbreaded, which is apparently hard to do in this town) and Kuma's hit the spot. The trek to Avondale isn't the easiest, but on the way back from O'Hare on Sunday night, the timing seemed right. Kuma's is half-bar, half-restaurant, and half-mystifying. The dining area functions separately from the bar, although you can dine at either. Bar is first-come, first-served, while dining requires a hostess to seat. We had three options: 1) 45 minutes to sit, 2) 30 minutes to order to-go, and 3) fight for a bar seat. We went in that order, and right after I placed the to-go, bar seats opened up.  Unfortunately, the conversion rate from a to-go order to dining-in is effectively zero, so we just drank until the food arrived, neatly packaged. The whole setup is reminiscent of Lockdown Bar & Grill in Humboldt Park, only twice as packed. It's for good reason, as the burgers and fries are delicious. And despite my whole roundabout story, the service is friendly and quite efficient. As for the burgers, the high cost, relative messiness, and overly thick patty bumps the grade from 5 to 4. I really liked the pretzel bun, the patty seasoning, the tastiness of the thin-cut fries, and most of all, the stellar toppings. I went with the absu, which came with a tomatillo salsa that was more green chile and as close to New Mexico green as I've come since Albuquerque. The fried chiles were over the top, but I really enjoyed the queso fresco and avocado onion relish. Again, big bites of burger ain't my bag, as I feel it detracts from a burger as a whole. But it's a minor complaint. Her chicken burger was simpler and just as delicious. She went Iron Maiden, a strange name for a relatively clean and healthy burger: chipotle mayo, cherry peppers, avocado, and pepper jack cheese. And as I mentioned, the fries are well-seasoned, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Just the way I like it.",0.992,0.821,0.141,0.038,0.5074379129642288

Freshly made Mac & Cheese to the way you want it and a harvest of metal theme named burgers that will make you headbang for joy. It's everything you would expect from a metal centered restaurant. They care about what they make and they give no shits if you don't like the ambiance. Get used to the loud metal playing and 'The Shining' playing on repeat. If you're offended don't look at the paintings and head somewhere else. But note, you'll be missing out on the joy of what this place has to offer. I recommend the Kuma Burger and the Mac & Cheese... but not in one sitting. Any of the burgers featured are amazingly satisfying.

The more reviews I read though, I am VERY tempted to go in just to try the Mac and Cheese (added to my list of things to do). The staff has always been friendly and attentive. THE ONLY reason I am rating it at 4 stars is because of the wait. While I expect a long wait every time I go in, it still sucks (probably because I am so excited about my meal that I can hardly wait!) Maybe the other location will help diffuse this dilemma a little. With that said, every time that I DO wait and eat here, the ""this was totally worth it and my food is incredible"" feeling kicks in immediately after the first bite. Every time.

I got the Slayer, the monstrous mound of fries, chili, andouille, and of course a burger patty. Everything on it was delicious - I was especially impressed by the patty, which tasted like the way every burger should - just incredibly beefy and meaty and great.

Not complaining myself as I have a strong stomach. :) They have really great burgers named after some of the most greatest bands rock has ever had.  I myself had the ""High On Fire"" burger, which has Sriracha, Roasted Red Peppers, Prosciutto, Grilled Pineapple, and Mae Ploy Sweet Chile Paste, all on a pretzel bun. I also had the fried pickles which were pretty good. They are known for their IPAs and other beer selections as well. I had a really great and hoppy beer (can't remember the name sorry!) and also a beer that tasted like banana bread. Unreal! The customer service is pretty good as well. No complaints. Things get hectic when it get's busy, and the people working were on top of their game and they accommodated their clientele well, or as best as they could have. It is a popular eatery.

When you walk in, it's dark, like a bar, but there are about 10 tables plus bar seating. Most of the tables work for groups of four, though I'm sure they can be put together. I hear this place is PACKED after 4pm, but we were able to get a table with no wait on Thursday at 4:30pm. It was really cold, so maybe people were staying in. As I looked around I noticed the art and music, but also that their food comes in MASSIVE portions. Their burgers are gigantic and their macaroni and cheese is literally an entire box of pasta with whatever toppings you select. It provided me with 3 meals, it probably should have given me four, but it was too good.  The mac and cheese lists toppings, which include andouille, chicken, mushrooms, onions, etc. You are able to select two toppings (included) and add extras for $2. I had the andouille and mushrooms and it was  delightful combination. It was baked with lots of oozy yummy cheese. The sausage wasn't too spicy, which it can sometimes be. My significant other had a hamburger with fries with chips. I don't eat beef, but they do offer a veggie burger as an option. I would have dove right into his burger if it was a veggie patty. It was perfect with the chips, which I would have layered into the burger for some added flavor and crunch. Pricewise, it was a little steep. Our bill was almost $60 and we had a side of fries, a burger with chips, mac and cheese (no extra toppings), and 2 beers. I also think that the $2 per extra mac and cheese topping is a little steep, but worth it because it is good and I'm pretty sure they know that's the general consensus, which is why they charge that much. P.S. It appears they do take-out as well, but it's a fun place to group with friends and I highly recommend going here for their MAC AND CHEESE.",0.9947,0.85,0.143,0.007,0.5811548987411056

Things you should know beyond the fact that it's freakin' delicious: - It's basically a neighborhood corner bar, so it's tiny, crowded, loud, smoky (from the grill), and has that dive-y character that makes a great spot if you're into that, but not if you're not. (I'm pretty sure my mom would not be into this place at all, but we 100% dug all of it) - You can sit at the bar and get full service, so if enough seats open up while you're still waiting for your table, grab 'em! That's what we did and it probably saved us 30 minutes of waiting. - The burgers live up to the hype. Seriously. Whatever you've heard, they really are that good. - Their chips are awesome, so split your group between fries and chips and share! - Pretzel. Rolls. There were three of us and we ordered the Absu, Pantera, and  Yob. I tried all three and all three were made of awesome.

I may have been completely drunk when we got here, but our waitress was friendly and we got a table right away on a Sunday night.  I had the Iron Maiden, a burger with avocado, cherry peppers, chipotle mayo, and pepperjack cheese.  I really, really liked my burger.  And even though the mayo got all of my hands, it's probably for the best that I was drunk since I can be kind of prissy when food starts to get messy.  In this case, I just started licking my hands. Nobody looked at me weird.  I should also mention I was dressed like a real preppie in a blue cardigan.  And nobody looked at me weird.  Cool crowd. I like that they keep with the theme:  burgers named after metal music and the music playing in the restaurant.  Personally, I don't really like metal at all.  GROWWWLLLLL.  That's what I think of when I think of metal.  But I expected it, so the very loud music in here didn't bother me so much.  What did bother me is how smoky it was inside.  No, you can't smoke cigarettes in here, it was the smell and smoke from the burgers that made me gag.  When we got on the bus I noticed we both REEKED of hamburgers.  My hair and all of my clothes - even my BRA - smelled awful.  It was so bad that I would think twice about going back, or be sure that I was going directly home after.   If I'd had to wait like some others have noted, I wouldn't have been so eager to give 4 stars.  The burgers aren't worth more than a potential expected 10-20 minute wait.  No more than that.

Contrary to what others have complained about we had great service start to finish from the hostess to our waitress. Unfortunately non fast food chain burgers now seem to cost $10+ normally. The burgers fall in line with that and are pricy at $13-$15 each. I will say that you do get a lot of food and I noticed after we ordered that a handful of their burgers are on special for $8. Look at their beer list for the burgers on special, I think it is only if you order them during a certain time of day. The beer list is great and the metal vibe was cool and what I expected. I tried both the Iron Maiden and the Lair of the Minotaur (my brother and I split them). Fries were good, no complaints there. I really wanted to try their bbq pork fries and some of their other delicious looking appetizers, but it would have been too much food at that time. My brother has had their mac n cheese before and speaks highly of it. Their mac n cheese did look great and I like how you can customize it The burgers were massive to the point were I felt like cutting the patty in half horizontally and just having one of them. I mean these burgers are meant for Mic Jaggar's mouth. The buns were good too. The meat quality does not seem great, not bad, just not great and there is little to no flavor to the meat itself. Maybe with so many great toppings they figure they do not need to do much to the meat itself. And the toppings were great and tasty. Best burgers ever? I don't think so, but unique and cool to try. The burgers were cooked exactly as we ordered them (medium rare).  I think all the ""Best Burgers In the Universe"" talk is mainly hype and people going there get caught up in it and all the interesting burgers. Next time I am in town, I would definitely go again and try some of their other burgers. I will also find a way to pack in some of the bbq fries and an order of mac n cheese. Oh and their jalapeno poppers and grit fritters looked great too. And again, we were very happy with the service.",0.9981,0.777,0.198,0.025,0.5631690476190475

No one is. 3)  Metal music, weird videos. 4)  They got my burger wrong, but I didn't mind because all their burgers looked good. 5)  I waited 20 minutes for my burger, and another 10 for my bill.

2013-11-01,4.0,"Top place serving a top burger  in a top city. Kuma's original location is like Whiskey a Go-Go in LA (despite having been founded in Chicago), or the Eiffel Tower in Paris - It is a must visit destination in Chicago. For years I lived with a GF in Avondale and I never went. Why? Because everyone's frat boy brother from Ohio, or salesman uncle from Kansas was also trying to go here. I figured - why wait, why bother. When a good friend in Roscoe Village let me know that  there is now Kuma's 2 in Lakeview/Lincoln Park and that this location has taken most of the tourist business, I was finally ready to visit Kuma's.  Now, admittedly, I went to Kuma's after having burgers at Small Bar (when they were ranked among the best in Chicago), Lock Down (after they copied the Kuma's idea), and many other places near and far as the burger craze took the nation.  To go to one of the birthplaces of the super-fancy-yet cool burger years after it opened was - I know - getting to the party late, I know that I was never going to wait in those lines back in 2008 with Kyle H and those girls from Indy. Nope.  Ok, so what's inside. Good old school bar. Nice interior. Good drink menu, good beer list, and lots of cute hipster boys and girls from Ohio and Wisconsin on the trip to the mother ship of cool burger culture.  I got the original and my friend got the special with the wafer on top. Both were freaking amazing. The burger is giant. I wish they sold a mini, but if you are going to name burgers after rock bands that drank booze by the gallon, you gotta have a giant burger. Our sandwiches were amazing. Fries and potato chips were top notch too.

When we arrived, the place was VERY crowded and we were told the wait would be about an hour an a half.

I ultimately went with the Plague Bringer in a really tough last second decision that left me wondering if I made the right choice...Well, I have no regrets.

Long story short, it was a publicity stunt that didn't even move the patrons of the bar one way or another. The clean cut customers were simply there to enjoy a burger and conversation.  The burger is dedicated to the metal band Ghost that dresses up like Dark Catholics. So the cookie on the burger fits the band's image. Nothing more.

When looking for places to visit while I was in town with some friends, what immediately caught my attention was the metal themed burger menu. Being fans of the genre, this place was where we were headed. It totally lived up to the expectations and more. Initially, we were afraid we weren't going to be able to try a burger because the wait time was three hours so I definitely recommend getting there early enough to grab a table. Luckily, we managed to get a couple of stools at the bar and ate in shifts with our friends.  I ordered the Slayer burger which was a 10 oz. patty on a bed of fries with cherry peppers, andouille sausage, chili, caramelized onion, green onion, and smothered in gooey Monterey Jack cheese. It was a sloppy delicious mess that reflected a crazy Kerry King guitar solo and it was the perfect way to start off our adventure that night. One friend ordered the Plague Bringer and he was blown away by it and said that he would be back soon to sample more of the menu. Another friend, who just moved to Chicago, sampled the Neurosis burger that he thoroughly enjoyed. At one point, one of my friends walked over to the kitchen, exclaimed, ""You guys fucking rule!""and I'm pretty sure they appreciated that sentiment.  The atmosphere is just perfect for this place. The music, the beers, the food, the service, the staff, is all grade A awesomeness. After dinner, we chatted it up with a few locals who we gave our seats to and they recommended another great place for us to check out.  I plan on coming back to Chicago next summer just so I can go to Kuma's Corner again. This place really does fucking rule! Kick back, enjoy a good pint, and go on a journey that will definitely satiate your appetite.",0.9966,0.787,0.195,0.018,0.5390432098765433

Also, side note: I'm loving some of the descriptions of the style here.  I've seen ""hipster"", ""punk-rock"", and ""goth"" mentioned.  It's pretty much an extreme metal bar and that's just about all they play (which is awesome).  In fact I think they have a sign that says ""Hipsters use the back door,"" so still don't know why that's on the ambiance list. Anyway, ranting aside, I love this place.  They have an amazing, creative list of burgers.  Their Slayer burger is essentially a patty on top of a pile of fries, smothered with cheese, andouille, peppers, chili and ""anger.""   And despite being essentially a mess of awesome more than a burger, it is possibly the best thing on the menu. The atmosphere might not quite be your thing, but the food is quite excellent.  Be prepared for a wait though (hour or more on weekdays, longer on weekends).  I'm hoping with the additional location in Lakeview the seating situation will improve but can only guess.

2013-10-01,4.0,"Been here a handful of times.  The burgers are good, but vastly overrated.  Beer selection is great.  Service is fine. Definitely not the best burger in the city.  The actual beef part of the burger is lacking.  It's large and they cook them properly, but it's dry (even at medium rare) and poorly seasoned.  They do make up for it slightly in their semi-creative toppings and tasty buns.  Though, however gimmicky the toppings, it doesn't cover up the fact that it's a sub-par piece of meat. If they reconsider the blend of meats they use in their burger, and use a little seasoning, it could easily be top.  Then again, with the crowds they receive, I suppose they don't need to change anything. If you go early and get seated right away or find a bar seat, it's worth going.  My day starts and ends earlier than most peoples', so I have no trouble getting a table when I eat dinner (before 6pm).  However, I wouldn't wait the ridiculous times people apparently do.  There are tons of places to get equal or better burgers in the city which aren't plagued by being over-hyped.  It's good, but not hour-wait good.",0.9702,0.789,0.158,0.053,0.46896258503401356
2013-09-30,2.0,"I do not recommend Kuma's for a few reasons. I'll start with the biggest first~ the burgers! Take a look at the list of ingredients. There is like 8 or so ingredients listed for each burger, and more that they don't list. If they managed to create mind blowing combinations with that much stuff thrown on one sandwich, I would sing their praises. But the reality is that most of there creations would be off the hook, if they simply left one to three ingredients off the sandwich. (i.e marinading the chicken strips then making that buffalo style after. It doesn't mix! One or the other is fine, not both.) Every time you add another ingredient, you risk it clashing with one already in the mix, and that is exactly what happens at Kuma's. Beyond the kitchen sink approach to their food, there is often a long line. The line often is filled with jockey, douche, dudes. And while I do love me some heavy metal, it is often blaring so loud that you have to yell at whoever you're there with, otherwise they won't be able to hear you.

Sure the wait can be long and there is no comfortable place to stand as you hover over nearby tables and try to avoid drooling on their food (or you may choose to wait outside, warily eying the decrepit neighboring buildings...), but it's well worth the wait. And I say this.... even as a vegetarian. Yes, they serve veggie burgers, and no, they do not kick you out or openly mock you for ordering one. Their veggie burgers are awesome, so for any vegetarians out there who have been reluctant to go their despite their meat-eating friends bugging them to do so, I say do it. Their veggie burgers are not an after thought - they are fresh and delicious, and you can order any of the ridiculously amazing burger options veggie (except some of the ones that come with other types of meat on them, I guess...). And from what I hear from meat-eating friends, the meat burgers are pretty phenomenal, as well. The only drawback to this place is that there isn't much in the way of ambiance - I assume that's intentional, and it certainly encourages you to eat and get out (making all the people waiting and drooling over your food very happy), but it can be borderline cruddy, particularly if you find yourself needing to use the bathroom... While the patio is nice because it cuts down somewhat on the loud heavy metal music to which you are otherwise subjected, it's not nice in any other sense.

This was cheese and green onions over pulled pork over bbq over fries. And there was A LOT of pulled pork, def something you would eat with a fork. This was good, not great, but I am not a pulled pork type of person.  All burgers came with fries, we upgraded an got a side of salad instead. Salad tasted normal, but was really large.  I got the special of the day burger (forgot the name), there was crumbly cheese and some sort of fried thing that you had to mash so it would fit in the burger. This burger had a unique seasoning, I think it was cumin or something. The burger was good, but not great.  I also tried the kuma burger. This had bacon and a fried egg. Cant go wrong with the fried egg. I enjoyed this.  Another burger I tried had pineapples ,teriyaki sauce, ham/ canadian bacon, siracha. This was also good, but I am not a huge fan of pineapples/ teriyaki-type burgers.  Last burger had pico de gallo, guac/ avocado, fried jalapenos, crumble cheese, and melted cheese.

Second time was pretty good too. I sat at the bar and had good burger and good service. I like a little attitude so no complaints about a little rough around the edges personality. 30 minute wait. The waitress was alright but ran my card for another tab and closed it out so I paid for two and will have to wait on my refund for the error she made. Today was my third and final time eating here.

2013-09-03,3.0,"3000+ reviews? Crazy, but just a little over hyped in my opinion. Always heard about the place but never made the journey out to try it. But with summer winding down, figured why not. Went on a Sunday after church and there was a small 5 min wait until a table opened up. Had a great waitress, Nikki I believe. She did a great job. Water refills were on point as well as the checking up on us was too.  Anyway, time came to order, and seeing as there are so many yelp reviews, there is no really consensus on which burger is the best. All these other yelpers that say all the burgers are good, you all stink since you don't help anyone out. Asked my waitress what her favs were and she said the Goatsnake and the Plague (which is the spiciest one there). Neither of those appealed to me so I went with the Slayer since some of the reviews said that one and I like chili.  First it doesn't come with a bun. She asked if that was ok since she knew I was a first timer but I didn't want to act dumb so I said sure. If I had a second choice then I def would have ordered something else. So the Slayer is just fries with a burger patty on top, covered in chili, and the chili has big sausage pieces in it too. It was pretty good, with the melted cheese and everything. Just wasn't my style. Burger meat was pretty bomb though. Ate that whole thing and then just took home chili cheese fries to eat later, not too bad of a deal. The girlfriend got the Lair of the Minotaur which I didn't really care for at all.  We also got the Mac and cheese and that thing was huge. But for 14 bucks, at least you get your money's worth. Added bacon and broccoli and you can mix and match other things. I personally didn't like it but after a day in the fridge and after reheating, it was pretty delicious the next morning for breakfast.  So yeah, burger meat is good, but it was just an alright experience for me. Ended up paying around 50 bucks for 2 people, but I guess that's alright with 10 oz of meat.",0.9959,0.76,0.184,0.056,0.4931746031746032

It seems that since they have opened their other location, they have started focusing more on the bottom line than their customers. First off, they changed the portion sizes of the macaroni and cheese and pork fries, you get about half of what you used to, but you still pay the same amount. That is complete BS as far as I'm concerned. I know costs go up. but the amount they cut back is ridiculous. Second, the beer pricing is outrageous. I expect, and don't mind paying more for micros and imports. I expect to to pay bloated prices as we are in the city. But when 2 other burger bars comparable to  Kuma's sell, for example, 6 Point Resin IPA for $2.00 less per can, that is ridiculous.  Third, they now sell T-Shirts on their website....

But I'm getting to the food. The menu is pretty big considering it basically only includes burgers.  You CAN choose from 2-3 salads... but why? There are like 15 choices of burgers, so we stuck with that part of the menu.   We started with the fried pickles-- which are some of the best I've ever had.  They are clearly homemade, and the breading and sauce were delicious.  For an entree,I chose the Goatsnake and my boyfriend got the Absu. I liked mine a little bit more than the Absu, but both were fabulous!

2013-08-17,5.0,"Where to begin? This place holds a special place in my heart. My first ""best burger"". I wrote a 20 page paper on this place and its culture for a writing class in college. I love it, even though other places are slowly taking the best burger mantle from it.  I love the Plague Bringer, the crunch of the tortilla strips is awesome. If you like spicy, get this. The original Kuma burger is great but I'm not the biggest fan of egg on my burger. The Metallica is also fantastic.  The Mac and Cheese is a meal in itself; if you get that and a burger you surely will e taking something home, which isn't a bad thing. Love that Jack Daniels is on tap. The beer selection is always fantastic. Get there early on a summer day and sit outside. If you have to wait, which you most likely will, try to grab a bar seat to eat.

2013-08-13,4.0,"Wow, almost 3300 reviews and here I am, finally! Better late than never, right? Plus, my two cents are always necessary so I'll try to make this review as insightful and helpful as I can to anyone who has never been. We came on a Saturday night around 6pm and got super lucky as I expected to get a 2+ hour wait time but for outside seating (and the weather was perfect) we were only quoted 45 minutes and the sweet girl with tattoos called my name in a half an hour. I mean a half an hour wait time on a Saturday night for a party of 4 on a beautiful summer day, that's a star in itself.  Okay so we sat down and after many of my friends recommended their famous mac n' cheese, I knew it was on the agenda. And thank god we ordered it since they do take a while for their burgers and we would have been starving waiting for them to cook. The mac n cheese is worth coming alone, it is the BEST I've ever had. This is what Kumas should really be known for since it was out of this world, I'm still dreaming about it day and night. It's $14 of heaven and includes two add ins so we got the prosciutto and the sun dried tomatoes. It was just something out of a fairy tale, I mean, I've had lobster mac n cheese in 5 star restaurants, but this was seriously the best, plus the portion is huge so we shared it among the four of us.  Now onto the burgers, one friend got the Led Zepplin with pulled pork which she thought was just okay, another got the Kumas Burger with the fried egg on top and she also thought it was pretty good. We got the Lair of the Minotaur which has caramelized onion, pancetta, brie, and bourbon poached pear. I saw that specific one on TV and thought it was the way to go. Honestly, it was just a okay, I've had my share of burgers and this was definitely not the best. It was almost too much meat and a thick bun making it super heavy. The pretzel bun wasn't as soft as I think it should be making it overall heavy and the pear was like soaked in the bourbon so it was also a little too much. It was huge and for $14 it should be, easily can be shared by two people. But after all the hype and wait to come have a burger, I wasn't overly impressed with it. My overall impression of this place as it is super loud inside with the music blasting so I would only sit outside. Our server was super sweet and made sure everything came out right and on time. If it wasn't for that legendary mac n cheese, I would give this place only 3 stars but there's no way I would come back and risk the 3 hour wait for a mediocre burger! Message me if you want suggestions on my favorite burger place in Chicago as I feel that DMK, 25 Degrees and Abigails in Highland Park all do it better.",0.9991,0.739,0.234,0.028,0.5798053075396825

2013-08-09,3.0,"I likened this place to Atlanta's Highlander. It's a No Emo, No Hippies, No BS kinda place and you'd better expect to wait 40 minutes for a table.. Even at 4pm on a Saturday. The walls are covered with cool hardcore shirts to purchase (too cool for me though), music, skateboards and art stuff. The wait staff are all tatt'd up in black tees with pleased looks on their faces. It was sort of reminiscent of my early 20s when I dressed like I worked at hot topic but could only get a job next door at the music shop instead. I don't know how that relates but that is what came to mind. Looks like a fun bar to sit at.  BUUUUUT the burgers are expensive.. Like $15-$17, and it'd be fine if I absolutely got off about this burger but I swear I picked the least spicy-sounding, most tame burger on the menu. One of the few burgers that I would not expect to reach up and literally punch me in the face - they all looked so mean and spicy, named after some hardcore bands like Pantera and whatnot. I ordered the burger of the day.. It had fried avocado, plantains and some other gentle sounding things... But I got it and realized there was some meaty-chili-like substance on it. Sh!t was burning my mouth! I'm SORRY I'M A BIG BABY. The fried pickles.. Now those were excellent. The breading became one with the pickle so when you bit into it, you didn't pull out that steaming hot pickle to slap you in the mouth and burn your lip. Get those! I heard this is supposed to be THE place to go.  I'd hate to stereotype a food, but if you like your burger to give you a black eye and scream in your face, try Kuma's. But seriously.. I didn't love my burger bc it was spicy but if I lived in Chicagoland, I'd pretty surely go back there to try again, and take friends from out of town.

2013-08-09,4.0,"Oh my Heaven.... Now I am a burger person, so I've had my share.  However, I don't think I have EVER had a burger with so much flavor! Quick note:  A friend and I were doing mini foodie tours of some places he wanted to go before he moved out of Chicago.  We decided to do Hot Doug's and Kuma's Corner one day and we would ""pace ourselves"" and save room.  Chyea... I tried to not get full, but it was tough.  With that in mind- I showed up to Kuma's not even crazy hungry, but still extremely excited and determined to try it.  When that ""High on Fire"" burger showed up... I could not say no.  Holy mother of beef, I was in love... Everything on it screamed quality and perfection.  The combination of flavors was ridic.  The juiciness of the patty was notable, the size of it was laughable (huge).  Even on my semi-full stomach, I could not get enough of it.  I tried my friend's ""Lair of the Minotaur"", which I have to say was my favorite.  The bourbon poached pear made the whole thing work.  Kuma's doesn't just try to grease up some beef and pile on whatever they can fit between 2 buns.  They use fun and unique toppings to create signature works of art. Only things they could work on... Service-  We were talking with our waiter, and she was just flat out not nice until it came to tipping time when she stopped by our table for small talk. Wait time-  Now I know when you have a gem, you expect long lines.  I came really early, so I didn't have to wait, but I've heard of 1 1/2 hrs to wait?  That sucks. Decor-  Yea I know Kuma's is all ""hardcore"" and metal love, which is great, but at least entertain your guests with SOME sort of decor on the patio.  It consisted of an orange colored fence... that's it. I can't leave this review without mentioning their libations.  A+.  It's tough to find places that tap/serve a couple beers that I have been meaning to try but can't find anywhere.  I wish I knew more whiskey, cuz they have a plethora of options, some even on tap.

2013-08-08,4.0,"I am only giving this four because of the insane wait times I've heard about. But unless you know the Fredy I know, or are a spectacular cook, this is as good as it gets. Not exactly for the kiddos or people wigged out by BDSM art / nudity / heavy metal / rock and roll / whatever the genre's name is considered nowadays. Although the music was not too loud. It was pleasant listening. I could hear the people I was with, the waitress, the cook, etc etc and no yelling was involved. Well, except for the chef prepping to go orders. Everyone was polite and courteous. I was born and raised in this neighborhood, same zip code even, but Kumas wasn't around back then and we essentially got gentrified out. I guess property values rising also affected the amount of real estate Kumas got which explains the wait times. Am I right?! ;-) Anyway, I came here because I swing by every now and then to reminisce. I had heard about this place from my friends and thought it was busy. My friends did tell me about the wait. So I passed it up until I got hungry. Then I decided to do something most people don't do nowadays. I just called them and asked what are good times. She told me now (2:30p-ish on some day that ends in y). I went. BTW, that little trick works great for the DMV. But I suggest simply speaking to the people that work there. They can tell you when they're busy and when they're not. Anyway, I was at least happy to see that BK and KFC were still around in case the wait was too long. But I got there with a few friends and we waited about 10 / 15 minutes and were seated. Awesome! Phone answering girl was on point! Fans may hate me but I'm here to give you my 2 cents, well more like 50. So anyway, back to what I started with. You really can't find a better burger unless you make it yourself ... or know Fredy. But still, I am of the mindset that if your wait is greater than 45 minutes, opt-out. Waiting for food will make it taste better. Trust me, I'm fasting for 16 hour days w/o anything consumable - period. Yes I'm Muslim, don't panic. Water is happy juice to me now and oxygen is the spice of life. Let me try to best explain waiting and hunger. f you've ever seen Kung-Fu Panda, simply put: Tiger lady: the Dragon Warrior can survive for months at a time on nothing but the dew of a single Ginko leaf and the energy of the universe Panda:  ... I'm gonna need a lot more than dew, and, uh, universe juice. So you can be a Dragon Warrior and wait it out or you can be a Panda. I'm both but I'm special. Ahem! ... and now back to reality! It's the best you can get from a business ... maybe. Why maybe? Glad you asked. Because it's one of the few top burger joints I've been to. Kumas goes up and down in terms of being the best but it doesn't or hasn't plummeted. So I will say it's a safe bet. I haven't been to a place with a juicer thicker well cooked cut of beef yet either. I have had tastier though, but that's just it. They're not as pleasant to hold, smell, or bite into. Simply the best I've had in a restaurant. Not worth a wait greater than one hour but then again, I really don't think anything is.

Both came out as we ordered (temperature wise) and on a pretzel bun!  They tasted great and the fries were awesome!   Their atmosphere is ""metal"" and their burgers are named appropriately, hence the Iron Maiden burger.  Speaking of, I've seen other reviews that complain about the music at Kuma's, which is playing in the background and it is metal and for some, could be loud.  I'm okay with it, but if that's not your cup of tea, then you might want to get your order to go or eat on their patio.   Overall, I would probably go back, but only on a weekday night or a holiday (like Memorial day weekend) when most people are grilling their own burgers.  It was good, but not worth the typical waits I've heard some people have had.",0.9827,0.821,0.149,0.03,0.5643939393939393

I took a trek to get there which would mean not having to wait for two hours to get some burgers. When I got there, it was true - I only waited for about 15 minutes. i really thought I was going to love this place, but in the end the burgers fell short. My friend's mac and cheese was honestly better. My burger wasn't bad, but nothing even close to amazing. I thought my friend's Mac & Cheese was actually better than all three burgers I tasted.  The funny part about this is I took my burger home with me and had it the next day heated up in the microwave.  It tasted better the next day than in the restaurant! My friends said the same exact thing with their burgers. Doing some research, I found out others online have had the same experience. It seems as if at the restaurant they are not letting the flavors/juices settle into the meat and when it sits for awhile, it does just that.

The best part was the frizzled onions. The burger was BIG, but I walked away feeling full, but not satisfied. That means a lot of food, not so much amazing flavor.  The fries were a waste of a cheat meal....kind of cold and soggy.

2013-07-11,4.0,"I visited Kuma's for the first time today, in the company of a relative from the neighborhood who's a regular.  This is an old-line neighborhood corner bar (complete with pressed-tin ceiling) which in recent years has transformed itself into a quite decent craft beer place.   We arrived about 11:30 AM, and were seated immediately, though by the time we left an hour and a half later there was a line out the door.  A friendly and beer-knowledgeable waitress took our food and drink orders as soon as we were ready.  Surprisingly for a relatively small space I counted five servers, though there were only two cooks visible in the open kitchen, accounting for the somewhat slow arrival of our burgers at a busy lunch hour.  I'm told waits can be even longer during late afternoon and evening hours. I had the monthly burger special, dubbed Harm's Way:  a 10-ounce patty with home-made jerk sauce, cheddar, capicola (salume)-plantain hash (!), and two slices of avocado, deep-fried in Alpha King batter, all on what appeared to be a egg-glazed bun.  This proved to be a great combination, if thick enough to have some structural-engineering problems; I ended up going after it with a knife and fork.  Accompanied by good fries; potato chips or a salad were other options. My companion had the Slayer burger, also a 10-ounce patty, served on a bed of fries topped with fried onions, andouille, cherry peppers, Monterey jack, scallions, and, so claims the menu, anger.   Kuma's beer list isn't the largest, but is well-selected, with about 20 drafts and dozens of bottles, with frequent rotation.  I tried two items, both new to me:  Solemn Oath Snaggletooth Bandana (a somewhat grapefruity IPA), and bottled St. Peter's Cream Stout.  This is less bitter than the more familiar Guinness, though still in the range of bitter rather than sweet stouts, and with some depth, with chocolaty notes and a hint of  black pepper in the finish.  A printed beer list is available at the restaurant, but not on Kuma's website; there's a vestigial listing on  beermenus.com , but this has not been updated since 2009.  Think of this as an opportunity to be surprised when you show up. Fair public transit access:  on the 77-Belmont bus line, three blocks east of the Belmont Blue Line station, and two and a half miles west of the Belmont station on the Red, Brown, and Purple lines.  For pub crawlers, the nearest other GoodBeer venue is Revolution Brewing Company, about a mile south along California Avenue.",0.8727,0.897,0.064,0.038,0.4157650489045838

We were seated right next to a gate that was situated in the middle on the side of the patio.  People kept entering and exiting through this unlocked gate.  They almost bumped me several times.  When are meal was over, we submitted the bill.

It's fine by me.  Here's my one and only problem, but its a big one. You want to be a metal burger joint. A music that thrives on individuality and rebellion? Then don't take a glass of water away from someone who is dying from the heat in the restaurant on Sunday July 7th! This date, it seemed there was something wrong with the ventilation system it seems because on my numerous visits, its never been this smokey and/or hot in the restaurant. Due to the intense cloud of smoke and severe heat, the two ladies I was dining with exited while me and the other fellas paid the tab. When I came outside, my girl was sitting on the front steps. She told me she felt ill from the heat. I touched her forehead, she was burning up. I walked inside and asked for a glass of ice water. The bartender was courteous and gave me the water so I could give it to my girl. We used the ice to cool her down. While we were out there some guy walked outside and dumped a glass of water over his head. I'm illustrating this to show you that, we were not exaggerating! Hey, thus far, no problem. I understand that ventilation systems break. I understand it can get really hot in a small restaurant with a very busy kitchen. I understand its friggin' July. These are all reasonable things to deal with, but when the door guy or whatever position he holds at Kuma's comes outside and rudely demands the glass of water from my girl is where things start to get shitty. I understand its against the law to have drinks, or glass containers outside of the building. So I told him, I'll give you the glass if you could just bring her a plastic cup with ice. He agreed but never came back. I saw him dicking around inside chatting it up. That's just shitty behavior as a human not to mention someone working in the SERVICE industry!

2013-07-08,5.0,"That was the best burger that I have ever eaten. Since I know almost nobody will read my entire review, I thought I'd be generous and put the ""Too long, didn't read"" at the top, rather than the bottom. For those with an attention span better than that of a squirrel, READ ON! I came here on a Sunday at about 11:20, knowing that they opened at 12. As it turned out, I got here at just about the right time. There were already about ten people in line. I read that there are insane wait times for Kuma's Corner, so I wanted to beat the rush. At about 11:45, Kuma's decided to let people in. I got sat in the back (See pictures I added), and ordered a beer. For those wondering, I went with a Dreadnaught by Three Floyds, which ran $10 a pint -- about the price I was expecting, given the quality of the beer and the ABV. Within a few minutes, I got my order taken and decided to have the Plague Bringer. Being a huge fan of ""Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives"", I wanted to get the Black Sabbath burger, but I felt compelled to get something that seemed ""new"" to me. The Plague Bringer, having roasted garlic mayo, crushed garlic, housemade hot sauce, jalapenos, tortilla strips, lettuce, tomato, and onion, did that for me. I should also note that I decided to get the burger medium rare, even though I normally get my meat cooked medium. For the love of God. Half of the 9.5% ABV pint of Dreadnaught may have had an effect on my opinion of the burger, but I was far from drunk -- I've had plenty of intoximeals where the food wasn't anywhere near as good as this. The Plague Bringer basically blew me away. First of all, it's monstrous. I took some pics, but it doesn't do it justice at all. With the bun on, the 10oz burger with all of the toppings has to be nearly five inches tall. You'd better have a wide mouth, otherwise you'll just have to eat this with a knife and fork (wimp...). Everything about the Plague Bringer makes me crave it right now. Obviously, the perfectly cooked, juicy burger makes me want to dive in, but the spice from the jalapenos and fantastic house-made hot sauce. The crunch and flavor of the tortilla strips that somehow stay perfectly crispy with all of the juices from the burger... I can't get over it. My friend went and got the Black Sabbath burger, to which he simply said was ""Good."" He wasn't nearly as impressed with his burger ... I assume that's a combination of being completely sober and his burger choice. I have no doubts in my mind that even if I hadn't had any beer whatsoever (wasn't much to begin with), that I'd be just as in love with the Plague Bringer. For $13, you actually get an impressive value. The 10oz burger is slightly bigger than the normal half pounder, and obviously almost twice that of a 6oz burger. If that's not enough for you, you get a generous portion of fries. The fries aren't anything to write home about, but if you couldn't already tell, THE DAMN PLAGUE BRINGER IS! Absolutely, 100%, no doubt, I'll be back to Kuma's (Not KUMAR'S... why are some people calling it Kumar's!?) when I'm in Chicago... and I'll *try* to get something different.

2013-06-29,2.0,"I've been wanting to try Kuma's for awhile now, mostly due to the awesome reviews and a personal recommendation. Maybe it's my personal philosophy that most things in life with hype is overrated. This circumstance was no different as I found the entire experience to be just average. We got in without any wait and decided to sit on the patio to avoid some of the noise. For the amount of customers they get to have two hour waits every night, I was very unimpressed. The back patio was rather run down, although maybe it's the ""don't care"" attitude that fuels this. We went straight to the burgers. We ordered the Lair of the Minotaur (with Brie and bourbon soaked pears) and High on Fire (chili paste, roasted red peppers, and pineapple). Both were decent. I tried the meat without the multitude of toppings and it was rather bland. While I did like the combination of sweet and spicy, I would just prefer a simple, perfectly seasoned burger opposed to a ton of extra calories piled on just an average patty. All the bells and whistles does not take away from what a delicious burger can be. The fries were below average and the salad was completely bland. I'm assuming it had the house dressing as I was never asked a preference but it had little little to no flavor.

Per a friend's recommendation, we went to this place for lunch.  THANKFULLY we were there right as they opened and got the last seat in the house.  If we were any later, we would've had to wait.  I felt really bad for the line out the door, just staring at us with puppy dog eyes.  The place is dive-y but in a ""this place rocks so hard"" way.  Metal is blaring out of the speakers, the bathroom is full of graffiti.  My favorite image: a painting of a teddy bear covered in blood with the word bubble 'meat.' next to it.  I think maybe not the BEST place to take your buttoned-up boyfriend's parents...but they took the aural punishment with grace.   The menu contains my kind of food: burgers and mac.  These guys are known for their burgers, so I went for a Pantera (all of the burgers are named after metal bands...the real life Dimmu Burger from Metalocalypse) which has housemade ranchero sauce, fried tortilla strips, roasted poblanos, bacon, pepperjack...cheddar?  What else was on this monster 1/3rd pounder?  I think that was it, but of course I put an egg on top because IT'S DELICIOUS THAT WAY.  I ordered it medium and sat back, ready to be dazzled.  While we waited, we ordered appetizers of jalapeno poppers and these cheesy sausage arrancini-like fried grits balls.  No bagged appetizers here!  If I only had the appetizers, this place would get a five-star rating from me, HANDS DOWN.  The appetizers are NOT to be missed, and I presume would go really well with a few selections from their full bar.   So, the burgers finally get to our table and they are MASSIVE.  I was so giddy and excited...and it took a few bites to get to actual burger (the toppings were great) but then I got to the actual burger and it was overcooked.  My heart sank like a stone.  Then I looked around at the rest of the table and they were experiencing what I just experienced.  If you are a burger place, and you advertise on your menu that you cook these burgers to temperature specifications, that should be the ONE THING YOU NAIL.  I was seriously bummed out for the rest of the meal and mainly picked at the toppings after that.  I would've sent it back but I'm always afraid that I'll get spit (or worse) in my new burger...

2013-06-13,4.0,"Probably the coolest bar/burger joint I've ever been in. Kuma's Corner is located in Logan Square in Chicago & unfortunately became ridiculously hard to get into after it was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives a few years ago. After hearing it was a  3-4 hour wait one night, we decided to attack from a different angle and wait in line 40 minutes on the street for lunch on a Saturday for Kuma's to open. That worked. Even at lunchtime they have the heavy metal pumping in there and it definitely provides a distinct vibe. Service was fantastic even though they got packed almost immediately.  My daughter ordered the winning burger, beyond question & fortunately it was big enough to share to the point that I've daydreamed about her burger on far too many occasions and have to say it was burger nirvana. She got the Lair of the Minotaur with caramelized onions, pancetta, Brie, and bourbon poached pears. It was burger perfection and damn I wish I'd ordered it! I have an obsession with pineapple on sandwiches, which is why I ordered the High on Fire with Siracha hot sauce, roasted red pepper, prosciutto, pineapple and sweet chili paste. It was good but my daughters bourbon pear blew that pineapple out of the water. We had great beer selections with lunch, too.

Caesar salad- we ordered the large since there was 5 of us and only 3 of us ate off it but it was a pretty good size plate.  The most notable thing on this salad though was the cayenne crouton. WHAT? Yeah, I said it- cayenne croutons! Yum.

2013-05-29,4.0,"As a professional hamburglar (in my head) Kuma's Corner serves up one of the best burgers. It was highly recommended from a friend during my stay in Chicago and an easy decision after a day of bike riding. We arrived around peak time for dinner & beer (5:30-6pm on a Saturday) so had to wait about 20mins for a table which wasn't so bad. The place was packed but it is easy to grab a beer and chill for a bit as you wait for a table. Patience is key here and in this case worth the wait.  Use this time to brainstorm about your burger or mac and cheese meal. I ordered the Led Zepplin which included pulled pork, bacon, pickles and cheddar cheese on top of a medium rare burger. Needless to say, that burger was heavenly, fit for the heavy metal gods themselves. Highly recommend the Led Zepplin for pork lovers and/or if you're a fan of the music.  The burgers are named after popular metal/rock bands which I'm sure true fans get a kick out of.  Speaking of music; KC blasts metal music so do not expect to hold profound conversations. The purpose here is to have a beer and an epic monster size burger.   Overall, Kuma's Corner was worth the bike ride from the Navy Pier.  It is a popular spot so do expect to wait for a table and for your food.

The beer here is great, you can't beat this beer list.  Zombie dust from Three Floyd's when available is a must try.  Three Floyd's makes some other terrific brews that Kuma's serves as well.

I met up with my friend and her coworker + her friends for dinner here. She was visiting from Cali and here for a business trip. There was a total of 6 people. It turns out this place cannot serve more than 6 people in a table. So we had to split a table which sucks because we had to talk from afar.  Our waitress knew nothing about the burgers when we asked for recommendations. She said ""well it is up to you"" which shows how much she knew about this place or food. We randomly chose our burgers and it turned out great. Don't get me wrong -  Food was awesome. I recommend the burgers w/ chips & Mac&Cheese.  So what really ticked me off, is after I finished my food, I was talking to friends from the other table. The waitress came up to me and told me to move and that I was out of the way and that I couldn't sit there. She gave this rude attitude and again came back and rolled her eyes to me with this rude attitude. What kind of waitress customer service does that? It would have been polite if she simply say ""excuse me"" or actually walked around me. Her attitude totally killed my vibe and her TIP. We left the restaurant, and I THOUGHT i forgot my credit card. When I called the restaurant to check if i left my card there, the person just said ""Call Back later"". WTF? CUSTOMER SERVICE BLOWS.

Now since the first experience I've been back 4-5 times and I've tried different burgers each time and my assesment is the same for all of them: the food here is little more than a juxtaposition of toppings. The burgers sound amazing but when you bite into it its either bland or none of the toppings compliment one another to create an interesting flavor. The service here is also lacking. I work in the industry.  I manage a bar. I would never hire girls who are as unapproachable as the girls here. I try to always assume the best in people but it seems to me that if you are not covered in tattoos then you won't be treated as nicely by the waitresses.  My last experience here was not an experience at all. I had walked in with my brother on a slow weekday morning and him and I were joining 3 other friends. The place was not full by any means. He had a more-than-half-full large iced latte in one hand and a to-go box in another as he had just eaten, although he only wanted drinks, but I planned on eating. The hostess very kurtly confiscated both items and tossed them out when they couldve very easily been placed to the side. Then we told her that we we're joining friends who were on the patio, which was also virtually empty except for my friends and one other small group. She told us we couldn't sit with them becuase its too much trouble to pick up an empty chair, (which there were plenty of) and place it at our friends table. Naturally, I said ""really""!? She proceeded to ask around and came back with the same answer. So my brother lost two items which he paid for, then they refused to let us join our OWN party.

Each burger is named after a metal or rock band such as Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, etc. As MUCH as I wanted a burger with a cool name, I couldn't pass up their signature Kuma burger-  bacon, cheddar, and a fried egg (mmmm).

2013-04-23,4.0,"So much hype. Hopefully with the new location, the extended waiting times will ease up. But actually, the last 2 times I went, on a weekday evening, I quickly got a seat at the bar, and the place was bustling, but not uncomfortably packed. As a simple burger, I wouldn't call this the best in the city; the beef tends to be a bit under-seasoned, but given the rest of the toppings, this is ok, and much preferable to being overly salted. The menu is novel and interesting, to put it mildly. TBH, while none of the burgers have completely blown me away, I have always enjoyed my meal and left satisfied, never had any real complaints. The one with the pile of garlicky pulled pork sticks out in my mind. The pretzel roll is a big plus; good bread in any restaurant is a big plus. Portion sizes are huge, must be a 8 or 10 oz. patty. It's rare that I don't finish a meal, but I sometimes require a doggie bag here. The chips or fries are ok, kind of forgettable. Build-your-own-mac-&-cheese is really good, perhaps one of the best in town. I'm always tempted to get it, but that and a burger would stuff 2 people, so it has to be one or the other... Beer selection is good, any beer geek should be able to find something acceptable. Though Kuma's might be characterized as a ""heavy metal bar"", a large part of their patronage are clearly non-metalheads willing to tolerate grinding guitars and cookie monster vocals to enjoy the food and drink. I believe tats and piercings are part of the required uniform for the staff, and while I have seen some of the servers appearing a bit overwhelmed when they were being slammed, they're generally friendly and easy going, though never too enthusiastic.

I was so embarrassed and my guest felt bad. We were then seated and the staff began to talk about the ID situation making it even more embarrassing for my BF, at this point my BF wanted to leave and we did. My advice for Kuma is to train your staff because clearly they are not well versed on how to approach a situation when presented with out of country IDs, you lost great client's. Lastly, please train your night staff on etiquette. The sad part was as we were leaving the cooks waved bye as if mocking us! Wow is all I can say!

It was so giant I had to cut it in half. I bit in and....all I could think was something is missing?!?! It is certainly a GOOD burger but by no means did it knock my socks off. I was really rather underwhelmed. I've had way better for less $$. I can sum it up that it didn't have much flavor, I was expecting a super beefy taste and it wasn't there, It could have been any kind of ground up meat. My burger was supposed to have horseraddish mayo and I couldn't detect it. It is served on a pretzel bun which was rather dry. The hand cut fries on the other hand were the hero of the plate. Super delicious. I actually ate only half of my burger in favor of finishing off my fries. My lunch buddy felt the same way about his burgers lack of fantasticness. The decor and vibe of Kuma's is really pretty fun. On my visit the waitstaff was prompt and friendly if not with a little sass. The music wasn't center stage like it sounds it has been in the past.

The cons: The wait is not worth it, in my opinion.  If you want to wait a heck of a lot less and get a great burger, go across the street to Square One.  It is also bit pricey for burgers.  Also, the smoke from the grill encapsulates the entire dining area, so you will smell like burgers when you leave.  Lastly, if you are not into loud rock/metal music then you will not enjoy the atmosphere; I personally love 70's hard rock, so it was fine for me.",0.9852,0.808,0.162,0.03,0.4616666666666665

I struggled over which metal band burger I would devour. Resisting the urge to let personal music preferences dictate my decision, I went with the Goatsnake over options like the Anthrax, Metallica or Pantera that more accurately represent my misspent metal youth.

I really liked the atmosphere, my beer, and our server did a great job.  Maybe my super high expectations were what led to my let-down.  I'd be willing to give Kuma's another shot ... there's always the mac n cheese.",0.9871,0.776,0.181,0.043,0.5213333333333333

I had the Led Zeppelin, featuring BBQ pulled pork, cheddar and (surprisingly fresh) sweet pickles on a massive, tender patty. Paired with a Dirty Bastard, it was a near-perfect creation. While the dining room is small, loud, and steamy, there is plenty of warm-welcoming character in the atmosphere. And if you don't mind spending $12-13 for a burger, Kuma's is a necessary destination.

Most of everything you can read on this restaurant is right on about the music, the wait, the craft beers availablility etc. However, there was one thing that is incredibly overrated about this place. The burgers we ordered were not the most amazing burgers we've ever had. They certainly aren't anywhere near the best burgers in the city as we read on other sites as well. One yelper complained about the burgers being pretty bland despite the uniquely designed toppings and I thought that was a very accurate comment. Despite the flavor, the burger was prepared perfectly. It was cooked to my request, medium rare, but just lacked the flavors I was expecting being so highly rated. I do have to say the pretzel bun was quite delicious though, but the fries were soggy and tasteless. Despite my dissapontment in the burger's taste, I do want to give a shout out to the staff. The hostess went out of her way to get us seated in a timely manner. The bar is first come, first serve, but when a spot opened up she swooped in to inform another duo that we were waiting longer. I thought that was awesome. While eating at the bar we enjoyed great service from the bartender who was very pleasant and attentive. We definitely appreciate the high level of great customer service! Thank you! Also!! There are no waffles fries and the menu stated there will never ever be again. That's too bad because their current replacement is definitely worth skipping the caloric hit for consuming them. Furthermore, the menu has changed a little too.

2013-03-20,5.0,"You would think I would have reviewed my top burger joint in the city by now, but every time I approach it, I feel like one tiny arm contributing to the wave among a stadium of a thousand other arms. The word 'futile' comes to mind, but how could it in all earnestness be futile when I'm so effin' serious about it? So let's call my arm a very enthusiastic arm in this proverbial wave. Having said that, what am I going to say that hasn't been said 1,000 times before? Yes, there is a wait. Yes, it is worth it. Squeeze in where you can to grab a Gumball Head at the bar and relax a minute. If you want to avoid a long wait, I'll state the obvious, just go at an 'off' hour! I went at 2:30 on a Friday afternoon recently and only waited about 30 minutes. Yes, it is categorically speaking a 'metal bar.' But no, this does not exclude the suit-and-tie crowd or the out-of-towners in jean shorts from exceptional service or a great experience. In other words, there is not an intimidation factor that some over-40's might think they'll encounter or feel unwelcome just because they aren't covered in tattoos. I have seen a very diverse and mixed crowd here, and how could there not be, when word is definitely out about Kuma's setting the gold standard for burgers in Chicago? Location-wise it isn't near much, so don't expect to cruise the neighborhood window-shopping Boutiques or anything. It's kind of dimly lit and smokey, so if the pictures are already making your mouth water trust me they don't do it justice. The real thing is even better looking. No they don't do custom orders but don't be an ass, trust the experts. Believe me when I say they know better than you do. The creative flavor combinations are amazing, I wouldn't think to put pear on a burger but it works. It is hard to pick a favorite but currently I would say the Yob.  The other thing Kuma's fans rave about is the Mac n Cheese.. And don't get me wrong I love a good mac, but if you're on the fence, by no means would I recommend passing up a burger for the mac.

They also had a create your own mac & cheese (which is my favorite food), that i wanted desperately to try, but the burger was honestly enough.   We paid on one bill, which was no problem, but you should know they don't split checks, but have a handy ATM machine for your convince. *I'm from Seattle.",0.9463,0.836,0.115,0.05,0.6090277777777778

2013-03-10,4.0,"OK, sports fans, read this review from the YELP SKEPTIC and learn--I'm a former big media critic and here's my usual pre-ramble, a guide to wading through Yelp food reviews: 1) Safely ignore fanboy or fangirl rants--too subjective to trust. Dismiss. 2) 20% or more of yelp reviews probably goosed along by the proprietor. Look for more rah-rah type drek without a single counterpoint. Dismiss. 3) Never trust any review that begins ""THESE BURGERS ROCK, DUDE!"" and then goes on to offer no proof or evidence.  So which Yelp reviews do you trust? Simple. Mine. What's the evidence? Read my other reviews--every single one a detailed, well-reasoned argument, and they're fun to read, too. So on to Kuma's. Frankly, I was frightened to go--not because of the Corrosion of Conformity heavy metal decor, but something scarier: the lemmings. Yuppie lemmings have taken over this place, which made me wonder if Kuma's was all reputation and little substance. (See my review for Hot Dougs.)  Turns out I was wrong.  Kuma's Corner surprised me, but not for the reasons you might think. The burgers are good, very good in fact (but not great). It's the outstanding SERVICE here that shocked me. The only true test was to go in at the height of lemming rush hour--at 12:30 in the afternoon--and while there was no line outside, the foyer was plenty packed. But within 45 seconds a hostess spotted me and said, ""How many, sir?"" Indicating it was just me, I expected exile in Wait List Hell. Instead, she immediately pointed me to the only open seat at the bar.   I only took about a minute to pour over menu items named after heavy metal bands before the bartender took my drink order. Wow. My bar perch offered me an ideal view of the kitchen. I didn't see any Marshall stack amplifiers back there, but a few wiry cooks beavered away at the grill with the intense concentration of Kirk Hammett hammering out pile-driver riffs.  I ordered the Mastadon burger: BBQ sauce, frizzled onions, served by a rocker in kabuki makeup and 7-inch stiletto heels wailing at the top of his shredded falsetto voice. (Eh, just kidding ... but it would be a nice touch for the soccer moms if Kuma's ever opens up a Schaumburg branch.) Kuma's is small. The bar holds maybe 20 people on a good day, and the dining room not that many more. But the burgers are big. Too big, I think. That's the only complaint I have about the massive Mastadon, which was delicious mess of dripping, sweet BBQ and generously piled onion string. And ah, the burger itself: A juicy, tender, slightly smoky patty of grilled bliss on a big-ass pretzel bun.  But ... it had me reeling in a semi-food coma before I was halfway done. They should offer lighter bites on the burger side, though I suppose Kuma's would lose some of its Hammer of Thor charm. And sorry, burger fans, but while they're serving very high-quality beef here, there's nothing grass fed, so my sources tell me (the healthiest and arguably tastiest cut). If you're looking for that kind of burger nirvana, try Edzo's in Evanston, the best I've had to date. (But make sure to go at 11 a.m., before the Evanston Lemmings arrive.) But again, the burgers are fab here and the service rocked, at least on my visit. I chatted up the hostess after the meal (not revealing my identity as the Yelp Skeptic) and she told me that Kuma's really is family. I believe her. Everyone there treated me like they wanted me to come back, even though I'd take the Clash, the Jam or even Britney Spears over Pantera or Pig Destroyer any day. All that sorcerers-of-death decor and the drone of industrial sludge in the background only convinced me further how funny almost all heavy metal is--except for Spinal Tap, which is really friggin' funny. Next time back, maybe I'll try the Led Zeppelin without the pickles. It is worth the trip--just keep your expectations in check, and for either starve yourself all day before you order, or ask for a to-go box.  You don't need to bring earplugs, by the way, it's not that loud. If you want to dress for success, wear black.

I was torn between the Lair of Minotaur and the Pantera. I decided to go with the former just because, how can you go wrong with all those different flavors? Well, you can. I was shocked by how utterly flavorless this burger was. It was cooked to perfection but had absolutely NO seasoning in the beef. And it was a BIG hunk of beef. The brie cheese was also tasteless. Even the onions and pears did not add much flavor. The pancetta gave it a little kick, but I hardly had any on my burger. However, I have to say... the mac & cheese? OUT OF THIS WORLD. I got it with bacon and scallions, and it was to die for. This completely saved the meal for me. I even have a huge leftover container with probably three more meals in it. The chips were also tasty, and the bite I had of my husband's burger (Led Zeppelin) was pretty good. Overall, I think my burger may have been a fluke.

2013-02-17,4.0,"""Well I woke up to get me a cold pop then I thought someone was barbecuing!"" Kuma's Corner is an experience. It's not just a metal bar to go for jams and a beer. It's reputation precedes it [literally] right out the door and around the corner [in the cold rain]. Besides having to line up before they open at 11:45 AM, Kuma's has a lot more to deliver also. There is *cough* [unique] artwork on the walls. Like, nothing you'd expect in your grandmother's living room. Or the living room of my friends. My favorite was of an otherwise cute bear that had blood around it's mouth and neck and a caption that said, ""meat."" Some of the other selections are kind of pornographic. Say, of a woman leaning back with her legs apart and hooha displayed. But none of that really matters because it's not why you'd go to Kuma's. ""And then the smoke got me! I got bronchitis!"" There is a haze of smoke in the air. A thick one that permeates your clothes and hair. It reminded me of when people used to smoke in bars and clubs and I'd wake up smelling like cigarettes and good memories. Only this smoke is laden with grease and good times which is a much healthier kind of smoke, IMHO. But really, I had to shower after Kuma's. I don't feel right commenting on the service because our table had a secret weapon. We had Nikki C (the Duke of Kuma's Corner AND fledgling Kuma's Too) as our guide. He told us when to arrive, where to sit, and the entire staff knew him and treated us well because of it. Still, we respected Kuma's rule to only have one credit card per table. I navigated the crowd to the ATM by the door and withdrew extra cash to pay my dues. Of course we went for the food. Nikki C had us order mac and cheese for our table of four. It had broccoli and bacon in it. It's like, why doesn't mac and cheese ALWAYS have broccoli and bacon? I'm not sure because they were naturals. The broccoli wasn't soggy, falling apart mess but held it's own amongst the soft pasta and gooey cheese. The top of it was crispy with bread crumbs or something. It was a really lovely combination of textures and flavors. We all loved it, but one order for the table was practically too much. By the time my Iron Maiden came I could only stomach a quarter of it. It was good and I enjoyed it, but the mac and cheese (and my banana beer) filled the hollow space inside of me. The pretzel buns used by Kuma's are really incredible and make the burgers special. The fries really were not impressive (especially considering the fact that they were cut fresh from potatoes that same morning). I don't know what to say about them other than that I think I could do more with frozen fries from Jewel. ""Aint nobody got time for that!"" I would definitely recommend this Kuma's Corner experience. Heck - I'd bring out of town guests because they would definitely have a solid memory stamped in the passport of their visit!

2013-02-12,3.0,"I had a Kuma burger and a glass of ""cola"" yesterday.  Pro--the burger--good plate presentation (for many consumers that's probably enough) 10 oz beef (size always matter.) Lean meat if health is a concern. Pretzel bun--standard and good. Plenty of good looking customers, pleasant to eyes. Con (for me)--the fries--if you like double dipped fresh cut fries sit for 30 minutes, when the crisp edges become a little harder and chewy, this may be your perfect fries. Con--the burger--not too much flavor in the meat (maybe a USDA Select grade), also on the dry side. It counts the egg to enhance the flavor and the moist. The vegetable in the burger are not generous enough--one thin piece tomato, one piece lettuce, four small rings onion. Con--a joke for any bar in this country--the cola is not Coke neither Pepsi. I doubt whether it is even RC. The gas is adjusted to probably minimum. It tastes like the cola I had in the US embargo countries like Cuba--flat with after taste.  I took a look in the cooking area and realized more. This is not a restaurant. The equipments they have are not sufficient for creating the volume and the great taste. One of the key reasons its burger cannot be tasted great: A cheap standard open flame gas char-broiler. This piece of equipment is lack of sufficient power to create the crispy seared layer, a definite required character for a great burger. A concluded Con (my guess). When a owner (or manager) with this kind of volume business still wants to pocket more on buying cheap soda syrup and save on CO2, you can see Scrooge counting dollars with a satisfactory smile on the Christmas night.

Unlike Epic Burger, vegetarians are welcome here. You can get any burger option with a beef patty, chicken breast, portabella mushroom patty or chicken tenders. Also, they use pretzel bread buns (which I LOVE!). I was a bit overwhelmed by the options, so I went with my server's recommendation (all the menu options have a rock theme), the Lair of the Minotaur - Beef patty with caramelized onions, pancetta, brie and bourbon soaked pears. This is apparently a shout-out to the May Street Market burger. One of my eating partners went big and chose the Bongzilla burger - Beef patty with a sausage on top of it (I'm not kidding). My other eating partner took the Motorhead Burger - Portabella burger with goat cheese, Kalamata olives, oregano, tzatziki, onion and tomato. Overall, don't get me wrong, the dishes were all good. However, it was all about the accoutrement and less about the actual burger. Please don't read this as a criticism, it's meant to be an observation. Here's a little advice, you have the options of choosing chips or fries with your meal. Choose the fries, the chips are super dry. Drink - They have a healthy selection of beers to choose from. I saw SKA beer, my new favorite Durango, CO brewery, on the list and stuck with that. One of my eating partners chose a beer only to find out that it was raspberry flavored (which was not noted on the menu). Service - So I was expecting to wait at least 30 minutes for a table for three. However, perhaps by going to KC on a Tuesday night, we found the golden ticket to ""no line, no wait."" Plus, we lucked out and got a table in the back outdoor patio (it's much quieter back there compared to the actual restaurant). When we got to our table, our server sat down with us. She definitely had spunk, one of those girls who starts talking to you as if you've been sarcastic friends for years. She had that balance of jadedness without being unpleasant. It's a winning combination. Every table in her section seemed like they had created a friendship with her when they finished the meal. KC won me over when the manager (at least I think he's the manager) came around to make sure that the food was satisfactory. Scene - KC has this heavy metal biker theme. Don't let that intimidate you. While the ladies room is wallpapered with illustrations of scantily clad ladies, the clientele is diverse and respectable. Dress - I would wear something that feels comfortable to you. Everyone at the restaurant is so distinct, there isn't a real dress code. Cost - For a burger and two beers, I paid $24.

2013-01-30,5.0,"This has hands down got to be the absolute best burger place I've ever been to. I no longer live in Chicago, yet make a special point to make it over here whenever I'm in town. The menu is just awesome. All of the burgers here are named after metal bands, and come loaded with massive amounts of deliciousness - caramelized onions, bacon, eggs, peppers, every kind of fancy cheese you can think of, and so on. Also I believe one burger in particular lists Anger as an ingredient, and who doesn't want to eat that? These burgers are massive, you definitely need two hands, and even then, it's kind of a losing battle and you'll wind up eating it like a wild animal regardless. They usually have a burger of the month, and I fondly remember their Thanksgiving turkey burger with stuffing and I think cranberry sauce. Oh, I'm drooling just thinking about it. Kuma's is also a great place to find new and exciting beverages of the alcoholic variety. They always have something new to try, and the staff is very helpful in recommending things that you might enjoy. I never made it out here when it was warm enough to sit on the patio, but I'm sure it's a blast during the summer. Inside the ambiance is pretty neat, there is definitely metal blasting at all times. So not a place to go if you want to have conversation, really, but for everyone I know it's really all about the food and no one is going to be talking much anyway!  On a random note, I really love that the women's restroom is wallpapered in pinups. Super classy. The only real con to this place is the wait, it can be excruciatingly long, but there is a takeout option if you'd prefer to just grab your food and go. Finally: I know the menu says not to mention it, and never to complain, but damn, do I miss the waffle fries!",0.9883,0.778,0.159,0.063,0.5889025594288753

The mac n cheese, fries, jalapeno poppers, and of course, burgers, are all outstanding. They cook the burgers to the correct temperature, the pretzel buns are perfect to hold up against the substantial fillings, and the flavor combos are generally cohesive and satisfying. If you haven't tried the mac n cheese or the jalapeno poppers, definitely get them when you go next. The poppers are the best I've ever had. A word about the wait - yea, there usually is one. Yea, it's an estimate. This place is crazy popular and they don't take reservations (and I don't expect them to ever take reservations, it doesn't make much sense from a business perspective given their popularity, volume = turnover = no need for reservations) so what do you expect? They're open pretty late so go at an off-peak time during the week sometime.

You have got to be freaking kidding me?! It was that easy.  After the mind blow...we already knew what we wanted. Cream soda for me and RC for the man. No drinking for us this night. We then proceeded to order mac n cheese with jalepenos and bacon. We also ordered two burgers- both Iron Maiden (medium). Our food came lightening fast.  The portions were huge. (I'm eating mac n cheese leftovers as I type this). It was rich, creamy, cheesy, and had the best flavor. Those breadcrumbs on top? Perfection. The burger was HUGE! I cut mine in half. It was the right amount of spice, kick, and cooked perfectly.  The pretzel bun with it was a great pair. Oh, and the chips? Light, crunchy and not greasy!

Kuma's is small, I can understand how people may wait to go until the spring, summer and autumn as the outside patio is open.  The heavy metal music fills the background as well, fortunately it was not cranked up on our visit - it was noticeable but not overbearing.  The wait staff is great - lots of personality and very helpful with questions about the menu and the beer list (which is impressive - great selections). We split a salad, the Kuma burger, and mac-n-cheese (with chorizo and tomato) between two people and we still had plenty of mac-n-cheese for a take home box.  The burger was cooked perfectly and had a nice peppery taste to it - and it was nicely served on a pretzel roll.  The mac-n-cheese was great - the balance of cheese, chorizo and tomato was well done as each bite had a little bit of everything in it without searching for chunks of chorizo in the bowl.

That said... there are about a billion places in the city of Chicago and the world where you can get a burger topped with a poached pear or whatever, and none of them (except Kuma's!) have a list of obnoxious rules posted for you to follow in order to be allowed the privilege of eating here. There is NO NEED to suffer the INDIGNITY of eating at Kuma's. I believe the staff here are selected on purpose to be total raging assholes. Once we had to call them on the phone (my husband's out-of-town friend wanted to eat there, probably because he saw it on ""Diners, Drive-ins and Dives"") and the woman who picked up refused to answer the most basic of questions (""Are you busy?"") AND managed to be a total mega bitch in about a 15 second conversation before hanging up on us. Of course they probably WERE busy because there is no shortage of sad dopes who watched Guy Fieri stuff his face here on the Food Network and want to follow in his greasy footsteps, but it was early afternoon on a weekday so we thought there was a chance. I can't recommend eating at Kuma's unless you like to wait for three hours in a tiny cramped space that is hot in the summer and freezing cold in the winter to be verbally abused by terrible people before being served middle-of-the-road food in the most aggressive and thankless way possible. You will get yelled at! They left the back door open in the middle of January in Chicago and when we asked if they could close it they yelled at us. Then when we asked if we could move to another table they yelled at us again! I think they also yelled at us when we asked how long the wait actually was when we were waiting for a table but my memories of the whole experienced are clouded in an angry haze so I can't remember EXACTLY. There are 5 star reviews on here which talk about how bad the service is, how long the wait is and how unaccommodating the restaurant is of even the most basic requests. I think you people have Stockholm Syndrome or something because I cannot figure out why you all keep eating here!",-0.9947,0.805,0.048,0.147,0.4744530244530244

2012-12-17,4.0,"There exists few eateries in the vast and wondrous city of wind that are as famed as Kuma's Corner. Having visited here once before around two years ago, I decided to make another pilgrimage to this ursidae themed eatery this weekend. A friend of mine who is visiting Chicago from the golden hills of California had been regaled with fantastic tales of adventures at Kuma's Corner and wanted to see for herself if the legends were true. As we arrived at Kuma's Corner and had a seat at the bar looked over the menu and decided to both settle on the same entree. Before I further delve into the tale of the consumption of said beef and bread combination I will first attempt to familiarize you with the atmosphere of this particular establishment. Kuma's Corner is a heavy metal themed bar and grill. You'll find various album covers and other homages to metal bands on the walls and behind the bar. All of the entrees are named after musical acts such as Metallica, Megadeath and Mac & Cheese (okay, so maybe not that one). It's fairly small on the inside with a kitchen that is visible from the bar that is around the size of an office cubicle.  In visiting Kuma's Corner on this occasion I decided to try the Pantera. The Pantera is a burger with pepper, two kinds of cheese, bacon and fritos, I had mine cooked medium well, and I was very pleased with the texture, taste and seasoning of the beef. The pepper on top reminded me of those often found in Mexican dishes and was the most noticeable flavor in the dish. The overall balance was decent but I didn't taste the bacon or cheeses as much as the pepper and fritos.  Overall my food was excellent and I highly recommend Kuma's Corner for those interested in trying out unique burgers. I wouldn't say it's my favorite burger joint, but I won't deny the quality nor the creativity of the menu here. Both the food and service are excellent and I like the ambiance. I highly recommend Kuma's corner and give it four stars.",0.9899,0.874,0.118,0.007,0.5113541666666667

A cramped 30 minute to be rushed through your burger, or pressured out if you don't keep ordering $6 PBRs.

I will be adding some eventually.  The main reason for not getting a perfect rating is because of location and size of the restaurant.  Every time I go to Kuma's, the parking is hard to find and the line is minimum hour wait.  It can be disappointing to always have to take-out from such a great place.",0.923,0.745,0.172,0.083,0.6296875

2012-12-08,1.0,"If I could give negative stars, I would. This place is an overrated mess. Arrived on a Thursday afternoon, around 4:00 pm.  The three of us were seated promptly, the place was pretty empty. (Smarter people go elsewhere.)  Immediately after sitting, our waitress pops up to the table, hands us a menu, and takes a drink order.  Drinks back about 1 minute later, she asks us what we want to order. With a menu so long, pretentious, and particularly drenched with rules, please at least give your patrons a few minutes to decide.  So we said no, and she came back maybe another 2 minutes later.  At this point everything on the menu looked so unappetizing that I did not want to order anything, so I just decided to share a fraction of my boyfriends sandwich.  He ordered the Iron Maiden ($13) with a veggie burger patty.  Our friend who was with us ordered a regular burger from the menu.   A few minutes later our waitress dropped off a plate with some ketchup mixed with Sriracha (so clever, Kumas), and a few minutes after that a new waitress emerged, saying that our previous one was ""going on break"".  (How kind of the first one to even let us know she was peacing out.)  Maybe 15 or so minutes later the food arrives.  I cut off 1/4 of the sandwich my boyfriend ordered, my appetite mostly already gone.  At this point, the veggie burger looks like an obvious frozen patty that they microwaved and covered with flashy toppings.  After reading reviews below, my speculations were correct: the veggie burger is a frozen Morningstar Farms patty.  Sure, this is a burger/sandwich joint, but I've been to plenty others before, and if this is your specialty, MAKE THE DAMN VEGGIE PATTY YOURSELF. It's not that difficult, especially if the owner/chef obviously sees himself as a highly regarded culinary master.  Also, being a burger joint, you would think Kumas' french fries wouldn't blow total chunks. WRONG AGAIN.  They tasted like they were pulled from the freezer and stuck in the microwave until they reached a proper level of dry, hard, and unappetizing. Then they were cooled to a perfect ""sat on the counter for two hours"" temperature, doused in salt (much like everything else served here), and thrown on your plate.  Oh, and don't forget the trendy ""ketchup""! You'll surely need it to even be able to swallow these awful crap-sticks. We finished eating, got drink refills more than 5 minutes after the glasses were emptied, and then the best (note: sarcasm) part of our Kumas experience happened. We were brought the check with a reminder that only one credit card could be used per table. (What an idiotic policy in 2012.)  We paid the bill and sat there talking since the restaurant was still very empty (it's about 5:00 pm now).  As we are sitting there talking, the credit card receipt signed at the table, the waitress comes, and ASKS TO TAKE IT AWAY. Never in my life have I had a waitress ask to take the signed credit card receipt from the table while still there.  This serves to say ""we are done with you, now leave.""  Still we continued to stay there and sip our waters/root beers and chat.  Less than 10 minutes later, the hostess comes up to us and says ""my dinner rush is about to start, can you guys please leave?"".  This, Kumas, is why you do not take the signed check from the table while your guests are still there.  People are your customers from the moment they walk in to the moment they leave.  If the check was still there, please bet your sweet ass the tip would've been crossed off before we left.   To anyone considering patronizing this horrid place, try your luck elsewhere. Hell, Burger King is next door, has better service, better sandwiches (and even the same Morningstar Farms veggie burger), better french fries, and it's much easier to find parking.  If you want to DIY veg, go to Dominick's and for $13 you can buy 4 boxes of the same patty that Kumas is going to microwave for you. My advice to the owner (though per their website they don't value or care to hear their customers' opinions...): go to Melt Bar and Grilled in Cleveland.  Meat and cheese can be done well, meat can be substituted and prepared from scratch with flavor, and all of this can be done while maintaining polite staff, a friendly atmosphere, a trendy/hip vibe, and a 4+ star reputation.",0.9807,0.818,0.111,0.072,0.44011660988584056

Worth it, I guess.  One time only.  MMM-mmm burgers.  Tasty brews.  Great sides.  Fun vibe.  I'd agree it's a ""must try,"" at least for a vistor with a lot of time on his hands. However, if I actually lived in Chicago, would I frequent this place regularly?  Hell no.  Reasons why: (1) My friend's main attraction to this place is its heavy metal theme.  While I like places with character, I don't share his bottomless love of all things metal.   (2) Yes, you CAN find an equally good (though not as creative) burger elsewhere.   (3)  At the end of the day, the wait is way, way, way, waaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyykeep waitingforatleasttwohours too long.  Even for a good burger.

I'll start by saying that yes, they do have good burgers.  However, the burger itself is on par with a good burger at many, many other places.  The only thing that they can offer here is creativity.  And yes, there is a good variety of burgers, and most of them are inventive. After that, they lose me.  I can get a burger that tastes just as good, if not quite as adventurous by sitting down at any one of dozens of restaurants or bars.  As I'm sure everyone else has noted, you wait here.  For a long time.  The more creative burger is not worth an hour of my life.   Could I pass that hour sitting (actually, standing) at the bar?  I suppose I could.  But the environment is cramped.  I could spend an hour drinking at another bar instead...and I could eat my burger while I was doing it. Also, their menu and ordering policy reeks of ""We know that people are lining up to eat here so we will do whatever we want.""  No separate checks.  Only one credit card per table.  I pay for things with cash so it doesn't bother me, but in an era where most people use credit cards, they need to be a bit more customer friendly. Speaking of not being customer friendly, my friend wanted to substitute a different kind of cheese on his burger.  Not add extra cheese or add cheese where there was none, just substitute one kind for another.  He was told that would be a two dollar charge.  I know it's just two bucks, but that is ridiculous.  I'm sorry if the chef's delicate sensitivities are violated when someone has a different cheese preference, but get over yourself.  This isn't a five star restaurant, and the guy working the grill at the local greasy spoon doesn't make an appreciably worse burger.  He will also make it without the hassle and air of condescension that this place smacks of.",0.9421,0.838,0.105,0.057,0.6076599326599327

Arrived around 8pm on a Tuesday night, 3 guys, wait was 1 hour. Ended up getting drinks and stalking people at the bar and sat down in 20 mins! Couple of drinks in and the friendly staff recommended some good food. We ended up ordering the chicken and bacon mac & cheese (you can ask for anything to be added to your mac and cheese). DAMN was this good. The mac and cheese is pretty much a pound of food on its own, and I was damn glad had 2 other guys to share it with. Creamy, with chunks of chicken and bacon, and perfect with the two types of hot sauce they handed to us (without even asking, which was a nice touch) of Cholua and Siracha. Now the burgers. Buddies got other stuff, but I made the mistake of ordering the Slayer. Seeing as it was dark inside, I didn't notice a 10oz burger was included. Anyways, it arrived and immediately everyones jaw dropped at the sight of their food (except the guy who recommended the place and went with the Kuma Burger). Seriously, the Plague is a 5lb+ dish....huge medium rare burger COVERED in fries and cheese and sauce. It was like eating a mix of burger and fries and nachos all at once. One might think this would ruin a burger...but it was FREAKING DELICIOUS. Oh, did I mention it comes with chunks of andouille sausage? Holy crap Kuma...you outdid yourself. I was SLAYED.

We showed up at 9ish and was told an 1 and 20 by the sweet hostess with perhaps the hardest job in the world, telling people this time when all they want is a good burger and some rockin brew and be serenaded by death metal and watch an asian film. This led us to Square Bar, which was freakin fabulous and only a quick run across the street.  We ended up sitting at the bar and was helped by a sweetheart of a bar maiden, helpful and quick. I got the Neurosis, my taller half got the famous brie and pear one with carmelized onions. Everyone around us got HUGE BOWLS of mac n cheese. I think we were missing something, but to eat mac n cheese and a burger the size of my head would lead to corpal internal implosion not fit for public. Side salads and great beer were also ordered (very fine beer list, I may add).  The burgers were tasty. The toppings and brioche bread were icing on the cake. I noticed the patty was slightly salty, and the pretzel bread, while not soggy, would still have benefited from some toasting. But the burger was solidly delish and the ambiance was wonderful. Usually when you get a salad from a bar it comes out of a bag, wilted and un inspired. This salad was huge and fresh with a delicious tangy dressing and a food runner that offered us pepper to garnish. Really? Over the bar rockin out to heavy metal? Love it.  Overall a fantastic experience to cap up the windy city visit for me.",0.995,0.814,0.165,0.021,0.5062330623306234

Visit 1: Quoted a 3 hour wait by a hostess who had an attitude. It only ended up being an hour wait which was pretty sweet. We ordered the Mac N' Cheese (super delish) and I ordered the YOB burger. I was told it would be the best burger of my life, and it was. After this visit, I went home and attempted to mac the Mac N' Cheese because it was phenomenal - here's what I ended up with -  centercutcook.com/four-c…   Visit 2: quoted an hour and a half wait, and it was only 45 minutes. Much friendlier host this time. We decided to skip the mac n' cheese this time and focus only on the burgers. I had the Neurosis and it was superb. I love me some Kuma's and will definitely be back over and over again, as long as they keep making those mouth watering burgers.",0.9892,0.822,0.178,0.0,0.6049019607843138

Second best veggie burger I've every had and they have an amazing beer list. From that my meat eating friends tell me it's the awesome topings that really make these burgers shine.

The atmosphere he described was appealing, and thankfully I was warned ahead of time that there would be a wait.  I had an hour long wait. WORTH IT. Easily the best burger I've ever had. Medium rare, juicy but not bloody. It was phenomenal. I ordered the Metallica for the 3 B's - bacon, blue cheese, and buffalo sauce. It could have used more buffalo sauce, but the perfectly crisp bacon and my blue cheese running over the side of the burger made me not care. My boyfriend ordered the Plague Bringer. That burger needs a warning. Neon lights, red text, all caps warning of what you're getting yourself into. Really. It was tasty beyond all reason but if you eat it, don't expect any sort of affection with your SO or interaction with the general public because you will stink. For the next 24+ hours he couldn't speak, burp, or breathe without garlic and jalapenos seeping out. If there had been a couch in the hotel room, he would have been sleeping on it. All the gum, tic-tacs, showers and mouthwash in the world could not kill that stench. I love garlic, I really do, but WOW did that smell. The beer selection is pretty nice, but a bit pricey. The atmosphere is all right -- it's a crowded dive bar and it doesn't care so therefore I don't care. I enjoyed it! Heavy Metal music is playing but it's not blaring, you can have a conversation without shouting. Our waitress and the hostess were great. Parking is street, and you'll probably have to walk. Still worth it. Whenever I come back to Chicago, I'm making it a point to stop by Kuma's. It was one of the highlights of my trip.",0.9884,0.75,0.171,0.078,0.4609126984126984

We were staying with friends in Chicago for a wedding and they decided to take us to Kuma's for a burger. We took the long cab ride across town only to arrive to an hour wait (we were not warned there might be a wait). It was the first week of November so I can only imagine what the place is like in nice weather. We decided to have a drink at the bar and wait. This place is a total 'metal' bar...hostess and waiters with ink all over their body, loud music and an open kitchen area that filled the restaurant with smoke. There are only about 8 tables in the place which is why the wait is so long; however, for a place that only grills burgers I think they should be able to get people in and out a LITTLE quicker. Regardless, we got to a table maybe 30-45 minutes after arriving which was fine, we made it through one beer. I couldn't decide on the burger because they all sounded so amazing. I went with the Iron Maiden (without cheese): avocado, cherry peppers, pepperjack and chipotle mayo. I ordered it Medium and it came perfect, medium with a pink middle on a pretty large kaiser type roll. I ordered fries on the side which were also really good. My husband ordered the Plague Burger: Roasted Garlic Mayo, Tortilla Strips, House Made Hot Sauce, Fresh Garlic, Pepper Jack, Sliced Jalapenos...he likes hot food so it was up his alley. I had a bite and the tortilla strips really made the burger!! He and our friend had chips on the side. Our friend ordered the Mastodon I think: BBQ Sauce, Cheddar, Bacon, Frizzled Onions. I did not have a bite but it did look great.  This is not a place to take your family, unless their into small, kind of dirty, dark, loud, long wait kind of places.

We ate Kuma's for the first time at Lollapalooza in 2010 and thought the burgers were great, but we knew it was probably worlds better at the restaurant. After putting off coming here for over a year, we finally made it last winter. Our first experience was great, we ended up waiting about 2 hours for our table, but everything we ordered was DELISH! The macaroni and cheese is one of my favorites in the city. The burgers are massive and the meat is always so flavorful. At first we thought the toppings were going to cover up any flavor that you could possibly get from the patty, but the meat definitely shines through.  We have been back twice since our first visit and sat at the bar both times. If you can squeeze into the bar, you're much better off. I don't think we've waited more than 30 minutes both times.  The only burger I haven't liked was the Goatsnake, but that might just be personal taste.

Service was awesome. Our waitress was so cool, friendly, fun, awesome, attentive.   I think there are only 9 tables in the place, and then a big long bar.  So, you are bunch up next to everyone - and the people waiting for a table are all right there, feet from you.  Really wasn't an issue.   The music is heavy-metal, but it is just in the background, so you don't really hear it.  As small as the place is and croweded, you could still carry a conversation with no problem. I would wait in another 2-hour line for the mac & cheese, over and over again.  I've never had mac & cheese be that good.  I could have gobbled down the plate that we all split as an appetizer.  I'm still thinking about it today...

We noticed a few things: if you are able to get catch a group leaving the bar you can chose to eat at the bar, if your next in line and your only a group of two they will seat the group of 4 behind you, and the wait time usually isn't as long as they stated.  We only waited 1:45 when the magical moment happened, we were called to be seated! We built our own mac and cheese and shared that as an appetizer. DEELISH!!!

A hostess came up to me and said there was a seat at the bar. No wait at all. Epic score. I was well versed in the menu since I have wanted to come here for some time but was always turned off by the wait. And yes there's a wait.

For the ladies in the house: size definitely matters and this place does it big : ) The fries were absolutely awful, they tasted like cardboard. I elbowed the guy next to me and hit a fry against the bar and it make a faint sound. The fries were just overdone. Fortunately one of the bartenders came over to me and I said the fries weren't awesome. Less than one minute later I had a new plate of fries. Sadly these were better, but not great.

Go with what you like.  Not a fan of the Howl, but the Iron Maiden and others are great.   Honestly, I liked the Mac & Cheese better than the burger!  GET IT!  It is a mouthgasm!  I ordered it with bacon and jalapenos.  You can ""create your own"" with whatever ingredients you want.  It is a HUGE serving.   Fails:  No reservations, no plastic ware for to go orders, long waits, not honoring the requests for how you want your meat cooked, overly loud music, smelling like a greasy burger when you leave. *(I guess some may like this. Not good for going out after.) You will have a long wait for your food (dine in or carry out) and a long wait to get a seat, likely.   I will definitely be going back.",0.9876,0.689,0.219,0.093,0.5725
2012-10-29,3.0,"We came to this place after the Spartan Race because a member of our group told us about the amazing burgers and the slayer. After a day of not eating and running a 9 mile mud obstacle course, we were all tired and starving. The place was packed when we got there and the wait was an hour and a half. We decided to get a few drinks at the bar while waiting. I was still caked with dry mud all over me since we came straight from the course. That attracted a few weird looks my way. The decor and music seems to be heavy rock inspired, which was fine by me. The place is small, so expect to be standing for a while. The hostess wasn't the most friendly person in the world, but she took our name and table size. While at the bar however, the bartenders were great. There's a great selection of beer.  They were very attentive. We eventually were able to find 6 open spots at the bar, not all at once but got them before we got our table, so we decided to just eat at the bar.  We ordered the Mac and Cheese as an appetizer. The Mac and Cheese was like crack, we demolished it quickly. That was probably the best thing on the menu. I ordered the Slayer and this is why I only rate this place a 3 star. The other burgers that came out looked amazing, but mine just looked like they dumped everything onto  a plate. The burger patty was overcooked, i asked for medium, and it came out well done. I attributed this due to the fact it was sitting on fries and covered in chili, so it was probably still cooking when i got it. It was very salty and had a weird taste to it (i can only explain as sour). I suggest getting the slayer only if you intend to share with others or if you want enough left overs for the next 3 days.  Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back to this place. If i do come back, i would order the mac and cheese and probably the kuma burger, that looked amazing. 3 stars for the mac and cheese and the great bartenders.",0.9924,0.83,0.134,0.036,0.5132882882882883

2012-10-18,4.0,"What can I say? I absolutely love the burgers at Kuma's Corner! I just wish it was closer to me so I could try the other super unique creations. After having bookmarked it for some time now, I finally decided to make the trek out to the north side with some friends for dinner. We arrived around 6-6:30 and only had to wait about 20 minutes, which relieved me after reading reviews of people waiting 1.5 hours!! The restaurant definitely has character - you enter into a small space filled with the thick smell of smoke and heavy metal music blasting in the background.  The menu is very unique - all of the burgers are named after heavy metal bands. One word comes to mind when it comes to the food here - HUGE! The portions are incredibly large so it is enough to share between two people. In terms of the burger options, it's a 10 ounce burger between a pillowy soft pretzel roll topped with crazy things like chorizo and potato hash, pulled pork, or skirt steak. They also feature a different burger each month. I went with the Lair of the Minotaur, which was topped with brie cheese, pancetta and bourbon poached pear. The burger was seasoned perfectly and the inside was juicy and pink. It is served with house made chips or fires. I went with the chips and they were great as well. My friends ordered the mac n cheese, which I've heard amazing things about - sadly, it was disappointing. I think it might have been an off day, but it was super dry and not creamy in the least bit. We ended up having to take it home to doctor it up. The burger was definitely the highlight of the night.  The service was great from the hostess to our server. Our server that evening (I think her name was Valerie?) was amazing. She was not only attentive considering how packed the place was, but offered great recommendations not only on the menu, but other restaurants in the area (she saw me yelping Thai food, lol). Having said that, I really wanted to give this place 5 stars, but I was not feelin that mac n cheese.

As another yelper said, the line can be intimidating, but I urge you to wait it out.  When you walk in, you may be overwhelmed with the music - it's not for everyone, but the food and service definitely make up for it. I do enjoy the music but if it worries you, it does start to blend in and you'll find yourself having a good time with good people regardless. Lets start with the burgers because, lets face it, if you're in the mood for something you'll likely find it on their menu. They're big, juicy and just downright delicious. That's all that needs to be said here. I've had the calamari which is mind-blowing! Sprigs of rosemary and lemon slices fried up sounds strange (it did to me!), but it is a combination you have to try for yourself. You may have a hard time wrapping your taste buds around it but you just keep eating and eating and don't want it to stop. The chili: HUGE serving - delicious and with a kick! Can be eaten as a meal itself, but I suggest you get a couple spoons and share with a friend so you can enjoy the other foods this menu has to offer. Salad ... Insane. Light and herby. Never before have I had something this fresh and pleasing, I find myself out here in the burbs craving this delicious blend. Lets not forget the beer.

Sunday, thunder storming, congested 90/94, 3 o'clock and we were quoted a 45 minute wait. Damn it Chicago, haven't you ever heard of Sunday dinner? Stay the hell in every once in a while! Anyway luckily we were seated after 20. Took food like 30 minutes to come out. Come on people, this isn't molecular, its a damn burger patty and deep fried potatoes. Everyone at out table ordered medium burgers, and every one came out more well done.  I ordered the King Bong, which had garlic pork, white cheddar, mustard braised onion and crispy pancetta. Sure, it sounds amazing, but lets break down how every single component was shitty. The garlic pork was dry as hell, and overly garlicy. Now that's saying a lot since I flavor my tea with garlic(not srs), but garlic was the only note. In combination with the over done patty, it made the sandwich almost inedible.  I couldn't taste the white cheddar at all, possibly from the over-powering garlic. Or the mustard ""braised"" onions for that matter, which were in reality plain grilled onions with mustard squirted on them. And note to Kuma's; crispy does not equal burned. I was excited about the pancetta, but it was so burned it lost all of its identity. For all I could tell it was turkey bacon. The Italians would be ashamed of what you did to their poor ham. The fries were horrible. Dry and overcooked. A friend ordered the YOB which was a little better, but still not up to the hype.

2012-10-12,5.0,"It's exactly what everyone says it is. Amazing. The first time I tried to go here, there was a 2hr wait on a Saturday afternoon. It was cold out so this was before the outdoor eating area was open. My friend and I decided to try Kuma's at a different time. If you're going to complain about the wait, deal with it.  If you don't think it's worth it, you are a) not a true foodie or b) not going at the right times. The second time I went there I believe it was a Friday afternoon. There were four of us and there was a 30min wait. Reasonable.  I ordered the YOB. It was delicious. My friends all liked their various burgers. The burgers are pretty big, I'll warn you. They are on a pretzel bun (yay pretzel buns!) and most importantly, Kumas cooks the burger exactly how you want it. I asked for medium rare and it was perfect. The third time I went there was a Friday afternoon again and a 30 minute wait. I wasn't in the mood for a burger (I know I must be crazy), so I got the mac n cheese which I've heard was incredible. You can customize it.. which was all I needed to hear. Let me say, the mac n cheese is even bigger and more filling than the burger. It was good but dare I say too cheesy? I know. Super crazy. I'd consider getting it again if I had someone to share it with because the leftovers were super yummy and for some reason I don't like eating leftover burgers. One complaint: There might be something wrong with their pop machine. The first time I went there, everyone's drinks tasted very flat. We decided they were indeed flat out of the machine, or they had been sitting with ice in them for a very long time and then more ice was added. That's the best way I can describe the taste. We told our waitress that it tasted flat and she just brought us new drinks. They were still flat. So we told her..suggested maybe something was wrong with the machine. We left it at that because we didn't want to deal with it anymore. The second time I went.. probably two months later, my Diet Coke was still flat tasting.  This is obviously not enough to deter a five star rating, because I'm not going there for a Diet Coke and should probably order water instead. Tips on waiting: in the summer the outdoor seating area nearly doubles the amount of people they can seat, so your Saturday wait times will probably be shorter.

Seemed extreme piling pulled pork on top of a burger. Her reply was, that's what Kuma's does best....extreme.  The only thing I found extreme was the amount of sodium on the fries. My thought though is you either go to Smoque and have exceptional pulled pork or you eat a burger. I ended up with the Black Sabbath. Maybe I just did a bad job ordering but there was really no flavour in this burger. Maybe the chili (which had little flavour) just masked any taste. It wasn't bad, it wasn't good but about average.

I thought the exact same thing 5 years ago when my best friend told me about this ""amazing bar"" that seemingly was named for a character in the 'Tekken' video games, that ""has a biker atmosphere and plays heavy metal and serves the best burgers you will ever eat"" while he was going to culinary school in Chicago. So he took me to it, and I've been standing in line for 2 hours or more on many, many occasions ever since. And I won't question it, because the burgers are seriously that good.  I've been to other 'gourmet burger' joints in the city, but they seriously have a hard time standing up next to Kuma's Corner. Kuma's perfect mix of gourmet ingredients, perfectly seared meat and pretzel bun is simple perfection. I have had burgers on pretzel buns before, where the bun distracts from the taste. Kuma's burgers, with their buns, are simply amazing. I have taken many, many people to Kuma's in my 5 years of frequenting the diner, and everyone falls under their amazing stomach spell. My most recent trip was in June, when my girlfriend and I took her three San Franciscan cousins. We started out with a few beers by the bar while we waited for our table. We assured the out-of-towners that the wait was well worth it. We perused Kuma's fairly extensive beer list, and I pointed out the Jack Daniels on tap (of which no one had ever seen before), and we set up for our wait. A mere hour-and-a-half later, we were seated at our cozy table and ready to get some well-deserved food in our bellies. We started off with the Jalapeno Poppers and the Make Your own Mac & Cheese, which is a meal all on its own.  Each burger was cooked to delicious perfection, regardless of what one was chosen, and the addition of a fried egg on top is great. The super tattooed wait staff are always pleasant and attentive, and know the entire menu through-and-through. One of my girlfriend's cousins put the food simply the best, by calling it ""Chicago Crack-meat"". And he was entirely dead-on. The food is too good to stay away for long. I cannot recommend Kuma's Corner enough. It is, simply put, the single best burger joint in the city of Chicago.

Then, waiting on the street to be squeezed in to a dark room blasting heavy metal music so you can eat a burger and fries seems torturous.

Here was my experience: Went there at around 10pm on a weekend night that me and my girl ""called it early"".  On the way home we decided to go because she's been here a few times and said it's the best burger she's ever tasted - she also ate burgers at the places that I am comparing it to, so if that means anything she's a huge fan. The wait staff/hostess was really nice and let us know that we'd have to wait about 45 minutes (not bad, considering we expected an hour +), but if we could nab a seat at the counter it's first-come, first-serve.  We watched as veterans of the place squeezed in and strategically waited for people at the counter to leave - they didn't care if other people were also strategically waiting. I get the sense that if they hadn't seen you there before, they were there to squeeze into the next seat before you could.  We waited patiently for our seat, and at almost exactly 45 minutes were seated. We ordered the original Kuma's burgers and definitely enjoyed it. Both of us only ate half because they're perty' big burgers. In all, if the place hadn't been hyped so much, I'd have been raving...but I think my expecations were too high. I will plug, and next review, Charlie Beinlich's in the northern burbs..since I still think this place has the best cheddar burger on the planet (that I've tasted so far). I went in there with similar expectations after hearing great things, and wasn't even that hungry when I went in... and hands-down thought this burger was the best I had ever had from first bite.

My friend asked the hostess if that's our table and she said yes. A guy (60-ish) came in with a younger guy (30-ish?).  Older guy talked to the hostess. The hostess went to the back.  I heard the older guy tell the younger guy, ""That's how you do it."". Meanwhile, the empty table is waiting for us. After several minutes, the hostess came back and said, ""Sorry, I have to give the table to them.""  WTF!!!  We asked why.  She said they're VIPs.  Again, WTF!!!  Another table was paying. A hostess with a good sense of customer service should have gone ahead and given us the table since she already told us it was ours and politely asked the old man to wait just 5 more minutes for the next table.  That is still a lot sooner than the rest of the people waiting behind us. And she wouldn't be dissing us IN OUR FACE! Despite all that, I was still secretly hoping that the food would blow us away, especially since it is the first time for one of our friends.  On the bright side, our waitress is extremely friendly and sweet.  Unfortunately, everything else went from bad to worse. The burgers came out dry and way too over done. Medium well was more than well done. The fries were tough and not hot.  I think I don't need to continue reviewing the rest of the food. It's a consensus for all 3 of us. We will NEVER come back.  I've brought many friends and relatives here the first 4 times I was here.  Now, I CANNOT and WILL NOT recommend Kuma's Corner to anyone.",0.9608,0.818,0.121,0.062,0.4621621621621622

We got seated right away, which was lucky since it fills up quick. Looks like a biker bar, sounds like a metal bar, and has food like a King's Court. Its got a tiny kitchen, so be prepared to sit a little while, but really, you can watch all the food come out and anxiously wait for your platter of vittles.  Look for my pictures here to get a great idea of what we ordered, but to be frank, these burgers were HUGE. They were perfectly cooked, topped with ridiculously unique foods, and served with a boatload of fries.  My wife had the GoatSnake - Herbed Goatcheese, Poblano Corn Relish, Cholula Lemon Vinaigrette, Buttermilk Breaded Fried Red Onion. Whoah!!! I had the September special burger, the Black September - White wine braised goat leg, black garlic BBQ sauce, sauteed spinach, savory rosemary funnel cake - yeah, all this ON TOP OF THE BURGER!

I ordered the Pig Destroyer and my two friends ordered the APMD (really a BLT but 20x better!) There was soooo much pork on my plate, it was running over. I swear there was about 15 slices of thick Apple smoked bacon on one sandwich. My friend used a knife and fork to eat it, while the other had to take out most of it to pick it up & eat it. We could have ordered one sandwich and been full having split  it three ways! My sandwich was enough for two meals! We came in and it was packed at almost 12 at night, so we knew this was a good sign. The place is decorated hilariously & the background music is quite interesting. There was a crazy movie playing on the the big screen &  it was well worth the price!

2012-09-30,1.0,"I've been to Kuma's Korner twice now, and both times didn't have enough time to wait the insane amount of time to eat there. So keep in mind that this review is not about the food, which everyone I know says is amazing. This is all about the atmosphere and the attitude, specifically of the hostess I had to deal with. I'm not even complaining about the wait, which is always at least one hour and sometimes two. Personally, I'm not the kind of person who is EVER going to wait that long to eat at a restaurant, I don't care how good the food is. But what pissed me off about this place was when I politely asked the hostess if there is any time of the week that the wait is less than two hours, and she got all snotty on me and was like ""Uh, it's always at least an hour"". Well, guess what? I can go somewhere else with a shorter wait and a lot less attitude and get a really good burger (like the awesome DMK Burger Bar). So this may be a sign I'm getting old, but I was annoyed that all of the bartenders are covered in tattoos. I don't have any myself and normally love seeing others who are covered in them. They usually look great, and I totally admire the commitment, but when a restaurant hires their entire staff (at least the few people I saw, I just thought that they are trying to be way too hard to be cool. Naming your burgers after metal bands, that's creative and unique. But this place is just way too cool for me. At least the food is apparently good enough to back it up, according to my friends, but I don't need a restaurant to be way too loud and way too crowded 100% of time time.

My only gripe is that they don't do the waffle fries anymore due to a new distributor. They must get a lot of comments about it because they added a note on the menus.  Go to Kuma's at least once.

2012-09-24,4.0,Kuma's is still very good but I think the little things might be slipping just a bit. Waffle fries? Nope.  Homemade ketchup with that tiny touch of gitty-up? Nope.  So much food on the plate I feel like I need a body bag for the ride home? Nope.  Still more yep than nope.... but sadly there's now some nope.  There wasn't a monthly special on the big chalkboard and now you can get a side salad with your burger instead of fries or chips.  What what? Side salad? Oh...  I thought I heard you wrong.  And by that I I meant I wish I'd heard you wrong. On the upside I was able to snag a seat at the bar at noon on a Monday with no problem. And unlike other visits the place wasn't billowing with grill smoke so I didn't smell like I'd actually cooked my own burger when I left. I think that might be because the ventilation hood could handle the number of burgers being cooked because there were fewer on there than previous visits.  What do I know? Maybe it was an off day?  Maybe the bloom is starting to come off the side salad?

2012-09-24,3.0,"Having gotten my burger education in LA (arguably the home of the current gourmet burger trend), I was curious to see how other famous burgeries compared to LA staples like Father's Office and Stout. Kuma's Corner was, naturally, my first point of interest. This place has eluded me for years -- every time I go home and try to come here, there's always a 2+ wait, and it's usually below freezing. Finally my friend and I decided to chance it on a Monday afternoon around 5 pm. Surprise -- the place was half empty. We started off by splitting the mac & cheese with bacon and peas. Holy crap -- BEST MAC AND CHEESE EVER. I'd like to think I've tried many mac & cheeses in my day, and Kuma's definitely ranks in the top 5. The cheese was creamy and bubbly with a perfectly crisp crust, and the peas & bacon were the perfect touch. Unfortunately -- and it pains me to say this -- the famous Kuma Burger didn't live up to my expectations. Perhaps it was because everyone had built it up so much, or maybe it was because I was already stuffed by the time it came around. Either way, I found the burger to be overcooked, underseasoned, and oversalted. I like my buns soft and buttery, because it lets the meat take center stage, but the pretzel bun was chewy to the point of distraction. I won't say the burger was bad, because it wasn't, but it lacked the balance that I've found in gourmet burgers. I also tried my friend's Mastodon and found it to be average at best. Service was slow and inattentive, which made the fact that they had no AC all the more unbearable in the summer heat. Kuma's is worth a visit if you're a hardcore foodie, but I highly doubt it's the best burger in Chicago.",0.931,0.812,0.121,0.067,0.5132777777777777
2012-09-24,3.0,"Burger #258: My Dream Beyond the Grill 'em All truck, Kuma's was the only other Metal/Burger joint I've ever heard of. For years I dreamed of having a burger named after some of my favorite bands. What made Kuma's extra exciting was that beyond the crappy household metal bands they have on their menu, they also include some pretty brutal stuff that I adore.  Deciding on which burger to get was the hardest part. Do I go with Absu ( youtube.com/watch?v=RCSR… ), the drummer sings! Or do I go with something more ""mellow"" like Yob ( youtube.com/watch?v=6xbX… )? Or do I get a burger based on ingredients?  After a lengthy discussion with our server on what would be my best path, I settled for taste: Plague Bringer. Not my favorite band by far, they're not really part of my spectrum of metal but garlic mayo, hot sauce, garlic, pepper jack, and jalapenos sounded like the perfect ring of fire inducing treat.  So after putting down a batch of sausage grit fritters, which were just okay ( yelp.com/biz_photos/pVPy… ) it was on to the burger; yelp.com/biz_photos/pVPy… Standing tall with a layer of tortilla strips, I dove right in. Good it was but great it was not. The garlic and spicy flavors were there but the meat sadly was not. Cooked right but under-seasoned, the meat never had a chance to shine. A sad sad day for me. I did get a chance to try a couple other burgers at our table and the under-seasoning was rampant. But at least they can cook a burger med-rare. yelp.com/biz_photos/pVPy… Overall it was okay-ish and I am a fan of the place, but it was not the super magical event I was hoping it to be. But since I must go back to that area for Wally's, I'm sure I'll give Kuma's another chance next time I'm in town. 2.5 stars rounded up.",0.9563,0.767,0.145,0.088,0.6343830005120329

Good beer selection too, so that's nice. But like I said, sometimes the hype is too much. Kuma's has entered that stratosphere where you have a tatted-up hardcore-looking waitstaff serving families and tourists, with a few hardcore-looking dudes sprinkled throughout.

That said: - It is one of the coolest places to go and some of the best food in Chicago - a ton of burger choices, GREAT beer, good fries, AMAZING mac&cheese.   If you have never been to Kuma's, go.  I am as anti-cool as it gets, so if I hear about places like Kuma's from everybody and their brother, I assume its all hype.  And it partly is.  But it's worth going at least once.  Wait like the rest of us and enjoy something you literally can't get anywhere else.   Then go back a few more times.",0.9083,0.849,0.093,0.059,0.4386274509803922

2012-09-09,5.0,I would like to start by making it known that this is my first 5 star review. Kuma's corner is one of the most unique restaurant/bar experiences in the Chicagoland area. They have a great selection of beers (Three Floyd's on tap) and an incredible selection of burgers. I have gone here twice now and had great service both times. One visit I waited an hour and one visit was 15 minutes. Both times I was able to grab a beer at the bar and take the time to look at the menu which was much needed. I highly suggest this place and think they have a great concept going. I am not a huge fan of heavy metal music but the volume is 100% tolerable and you are able to have a normal conversation with your party without having to talk loud or feel that its overpowering the experience.,0.8746,0.892,0.088,0.02,0.654888888888889

It's always a long wait (like 1 1/2-2 hours) in the evening time to get in.  During the day is usually less of a wait time.   The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is that the music is uber loud. Don't let the tatooed weird looking people and staff scare you away.  This is what makes this place so good! Trust me once you've eaten here you'll never want another burger outside this jont ever!  Oh and check out the home made rootbeer.  Can someone say heaven?,0.9791,0.761,0.172,0.067,0.5213492063492063
2012-09-08,1.0,"Honestly skipped this place. it's gone to crap. Crappy service and the food isn't as great as it use to be. Yesterday, I thought it would have been a great idea to take my sister out to Kumas as birthday thing because she has NEVER been there before. Now i regret ever taking her there. We arrived around 10pm and our wait was 30 minutes and that was no biggie; the wait could have been worse. Time passes and Machete was on the TV!  Anyway, straight  to where it all goes to shit: As she hostess was going to seat us. I guess my brother-in-law asked the hostess a question. He didn't antagonize her or anything just a simple fucking question that can be answered calmly.  Why did she seat the group of 4 before us [it was an incomplete party] while WE [a complete party] waited? She just flipped her shit and started yelling at ALL of us as if we all were attacking her. WTH!?  I didn't even know about all this until the hostess was screaming into MY ear and yelling at the top of her lungs! Whoa! She popped my fucking eardrum!  WTF did I say!??? Nothing!  Anyway, it was just a simple question and it not like the REST of the party was asking or attacking her.   VERY UNPROFESSIONAL to be screaming at clients. And no don't give me that crap that the music was loud when I can perfectly hear you. I'm pretty sure the hostess has take some B.S. from other people earlier in the day or hell maybe she life just flat out sucks and therefore she is a bitch, i really don't know and I don't give a crap/. But! one thing I SURE KNOW is that you do NOT yell at people. It doesn't matter how rude they are to you  sometimes you got to suck it up or find another way to deal with them professionally. And most of all you don't embarrassed them in front of other clients. At this point, i just wanted to leave but it was a birthday dinner for my sister and well I didn't want to disappoint her; i PRAISED   the burgers from Kuma's corner and I was HOPING she would overlook the shitty service ....but I guess not because now i feel like a total liar. The burger were not even that great at all. The meat wasn't seasoned and the fries were under cooked. It just tasted like a crappy burger.  The best choice would have been Burger King down the block.  I'm very disappointed Kuma's Corner.  Also, I  have notice that this is STRIKE 2 for that same hostess who antagonistic ANOTHER customer the day before!!!  Really?? I think it is time for Kuma to let that sourpuss go because Food service  IS NOT FOR HER. I will never come back here again and to avoid anyone else to go through the same I might as well spread the word. Fuck--that--shit. I will give them this. The second waitress with the short hair.... after all that bullshit.... she was the nicest one [or at least pretended to be, idk]  she brought us cups of water even though we still had our beers It's the little things like that I really appreciated and that is why we LEFT YOU a hefty tip. :D *Avoid Kuma's at all cost!!!!  --the wait is not worth it anymore. --service is sooo shitty and unprofessional [you're practically paying to get yelled at] -- the food is not so great anymore.

I know that I waited for about 75 minutes for my food and the opinion among my friends is that this is on the lower end of the range. I do not suggest going here starving and I would also recommend planning to have a few drinks before your meal, just to pass the time and enjoy yourself. Despite all of this, I still give this place 4 stars, so I think that should say something about just how amazing these burgers are.

This place is essentially a hallway, so it is impossible to not be in the way. Kuma's is going through growing pains. To the Chinese reviewer who said she thought the staff is racist, I get the sense that the staff loathes all walks of life equally. Let me help you out Kuma's. Your place is no longer a BAR with food. It is a restaurant, and no one is going to come here just for a drink. Your clientele is there for one thing, to eat. Assume that everyone who walks in the door wants to eat, and therefore they don't care if it's at the bar, a table, or a cardboard box in the back. Keep everyone outside, put out some overhangs for when it rains and use all areas inside for eating. The Kuma's experience consisted of my two friends at the bar in one bar seat ordering drinks and an app while we waited for a table to seat all four of us. The hostess then came over to my friends at the bar and asked, ""is your name on the list, you cant just sit here."" ""Yes, our name is on the list for a party of four."" she walks away, about five minutes later, ""If you're not eating a meal, move so someone else can eat."" Ok, your place, your rules, we'll move. But then who sits in their seat, some f*king employee. Who we watched for at least ten minutes, whose only job seemed to be to create atmosphere.  So great job hostess, move us for the employee doing nothing when we're doing well for the bartender by buying drinks and apps. We left, the terrible part about this place is that there's not much else around it, except for Hot Doug's. If I was a restaurant owner I would open a place right next to Kuma's, and absorb all the customers who leave. You'd make double what Kumas Corner is, since they seem to think the only keys to success are burgers, a theme, and great Yelp reviews.

That's what Kuma's Corner is all about, not giving an eff about you, your attitude, your preferences, or your desire to split your check 6 ways on 6 credit cards when they're totally slammed and the server doesn't have like 15 minutes to run all your cards and figure out how exactly you split a mac n cheese 6 ways, or 5 ways because one of you is lactose intolerant or whatever...  Frankly  I love them for it, and if you're the type to complain, then go somewhere else, it seems to be what they'd prefer anyway. The burgers are definitely worth the sometimes long wait - creatively assembled, perfectly cooked, with high quality ingredients - the beer selection is strong - featuring a ton of craft and specialty beers - and appetizers are also formidable (build your own mac n cheese? don't mind if I do). The staff has always been awesome to the effect that they make recommendations, bring you what you order, and will occasionally make fun of someone at your table if they're a total tool.  With the music blasting, you don't have to listen to neighboring tables' conversations, or worse, talk to the people you're with while you're trying to take a burger masterpiece to the dome, there's nothing not to like as long as you're not a totally uptight jerk.

I met racist people who ask me not to speak Chinese in US. I met creepy old guys in the salsa club, but I was never treated this bad by anyone. Good job, Kuma;s Corner, you made it!!!! It was Aug 16th. I arrived there around 7:14pm to join my friends who had been there for a wile. They were seated at the back patio. There were 8 of them sitting right by two tables. I saw there was an chair by the other table, so I moved one over. Right at that moment, the server walked over from the kitchen. She stared at me and asked me that the chair is not allowed to move in a really rude way. I was just shocked. I asked why and she said it is their policy. I put it back and she left. Another friend arrived and he had no seat as well. Two ladies who we do not know invited us to sit with them, since they have two open chair. 30secs later, the same server came back with another lady, they questioned us that ""do you know each other?"". I said ""yes, they invited us to sit with them."" She responded that ""well, we are not allowed to join tables and you guys cannot cut lines"". The lady who invited us to sit said""but they are with the other two tables, they have already been here for a while, they are not cutting lines. "" We argued for about a minute and I decided to do whatever she wants me to do, so I left the table and walked with her to the front door. She asked me if I want to get a table of two. I said yes. She put my name down. I asked her""can I go back to hangout with my friends?"" She said: ""it is not allowed and you cannot sit down anywhere even there are seats, you can only stand up and as long as YOU ARE OUT OF OUR WAY,  you can go back"" Speechless........... I totally understand how hard to run a business when it is crowded and servers are really stressful in this place. I understand that certain rules are necessary to avoid things go crazy. However, will it be better to try to explain to customers who does not understand the rules, instead of making them feel embarrassed and talk to them in a really rude way?

So I can only imagine the kind of wait we would have had to endure if we'd been there at lunchtime. The menu is amazing. All kinds of different toppings for the burgers and any burger can be made with chicken, beef or even a veggie patty.  I had the Iron Maiden with grilled chicken. OH. MY. GOD. Its definitely the BEST burger I have ever eaten. EVER!! It comes with avocados, peppers, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayo and something else that I cant remember. I did make one mistake though. I usually cut up my burgers in half so they're easier to eat. But this time the chipotle mayo leaked out at the bottom and made the bottom burger bun a little soggy. But that was alright, this was simply the best tasting burger I've ever had in my life. Thats all that really matters. The ambiance is like your typical pub/eatery. As a side note, we felt out of place at this joint. Coz it seemed like we were the only people here without any tattoos. Lol.

When my friends and I first arrived, we were greeted with the mouth-watering aroma of a summer-styled backyard grill. Unfortunately, we were told that the wait for three seats was approximated at 1 hour and 40 minutes, but after hearing so much hype and wafting the savory smell of charred beef, my friends and I were committed to stay until we tried those damn burgers. We passed some time by socializing with the hostess -- who was exceptionally nice -- and  we also watched some crazy anime about a battle royal-esque drag race near the bar. The decor of the place was unique to say the least. Skateboards lined the wall, graphic art was sporadically placed throughout, and a hint of erotica to top it off nicely. Although the place was pretty cool, everyone knows that you come here for the burgers. We got our seats a little earlier than what was predicted and we quickly ordered our food. I ordered the Black Sabbath and a side of macaroni and cheese. Our food came out very promptly and amazingly it looked as good as it smelled. The first bite of this burger was amazing. You can immediately taste the seasoning drip off the juicy, yet tender beef patty. The burger was also cooked to perfection. I ordered mine medium-rare, and it was exactly as prescribed. The pretzel bun is also an amazing touch. Its accents are very subtle and the bun does not get soggy over the duration of your meal. The fries were crisp and delicious as well. Unfortunately I was so full from the burger I could not enjoy my macaroni and cheese at the restaurant, so I packed it to go. Kuma's Corner definitely lived up to the hype and I greatly look forward to trying their other burgers in the near future.

I had the Iron Maiden and he had the Led Zeppelin. Neither tasted good simply because the meat itself was flavorless. The toppings are not plentiful and do not contribute to the burger at all. Service was alright though we had to wait a while for the server to come back. All in all I did not like the experience, but I was willing to give Kuma's a second chance. They got a second chance, and I am never coming back. This time I went with a group of friends; there was six of us. We came in and we were told to wait 25 minutes for a table for six. It was not a problem. We waited outside because it was a beautiful day. The hostess, however, was not very helpful because she did not take a name down or even come get us when our table was ready, but rather we had to go in and ask if the table was available yet. Once we were seated a waitress came up and asked if we wanted anything other than water and proceeded to throw coasters at us instead of placing them on the table. One of my friends accidentally spilled his water which we proceeded to try to mop up when the waitress returned with a stack of paper towels grumbling ""don't do that with the napkins"", it took her ten minutes to take away our sopping wet napkins and she did not bring us any napkins back after that. We all ordered and when we got our food in about twenty minutes but she forgot one of the orders, which is understandable, but when we received the last sandwich ten minutes later, she asked my friend ""does it taste better now that it's late?""... At no point throughout the meal did the waitress stop by to ask if everything was going good and did not come around to refill our water glasses until the end when we finally managed to grab her attention.  This time I ordered the Lair of the Minotaur. It was an interesting combination of flavors and would have been good if not for a flavorless 10 oz. lump of beef. We paid but did not tip because as an employee of food service myself I did not feel that the waitress was attentive and I did not enjoy the food. As we were standing outside saying our goodbyes, the waitress walks out and asks if the service was bad because we did not leave a tip. I do not feel the need to have to explain myself as to why I did not leave a tip, that in and of itself represents the kind of waitress she is if she follows the customers out asking about a tip. I understand that in our culture we tip by default, but a tip is also a representation of the customer's satisfaction and seeing as how I was not satisfied I chose not to pay more than I already did.

2012-07-31,5.0,"I'm a Kuma's masochist; it is my favorite restaurant, but it can be unbearable. We once waited four hours for a table--starting at 4 pm. Last week their air conditioning was broken, on a 100-degree day--and we stayed and sweated and loved every minute of it. I'm a vegetarian, and they won't let you remove the meat from any of the burgers with meaty-toppings, so 3/4 of the menu is off limits to me. We have to sit in traffic for half an hour to get here, no matter what route we take. My love of this place is not entirely logical, I admit it. It's possible to work the system: never go as a party of more than two, and sit at the bar. Never go on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, at any time of day. Aim for midweek, 5:30 pm.  I always order the same thing--an Absu with a veggie burger. I'm pretty sure the patty is just a gardenburger, but it doesn't matter. Here's what matters: pretzel bun, melted pepper jack, tomatillo salsa, avocado relish, queso fresco, and some deep fried chile pepper rings that vary in intensity from flavorful to death-inducing. You never know till you're done just how hot this burger will be. The toppings are so thought out--this is the antithesis of the ""build your own,"" which now seems like such a cop out to me. Everything is in the perfect proportion; it's an intelligent, balanced set of flavors.  We order the mac & cheese--with sun-dried tomatoes and broccoli--on special occasions. One of us gets the fries (I'm suspect they might make their own ketchup); one gets the salad, which is dressed in a pesto vinagrette that's mouth watering.

Overall, I must say, well worth it!     We were told there would be a 20 minute wait for indoor seating (if it was not 95 today, perhaps we'd have opted for the patio dining area), but we only waited about 10. Bar seating was available, we simply preferred a table.        I had the Plague Bringer, which was absolutely scrumptious, bursting with the robust flavors of pepper jack cheese, jalapeño, and garlic. I ordered it medium, and it was cooked to perfection, with juices oozing out of every bite! Hands down the best burger I've ever eaten! The pretzel bun is an added bonus, and was one of my hubby's favorite parts. He ordered the classic Kuma Burger, topped with fried egg, and said it was amazing!!     To explain why it didn't earn the 5th star from me, I will say this: as other yelpers have stated, it is extremely loud in there! Heavy metal blasting so loud you can barely hear yourself think! However, this alone was not a major issue for us. What really took away from the experience was the fact that the place is VERY poorly ventilated. Before our drinks even arrived, we both noticed that our eyes felt very dry and itchy, and it just seemed like the fumes from the kitchen were hitting us head on (though perhaps this may have been due to where we were seated, which was, in fact, in the vicinity of the kitchen).      Apart from those 2 negatives, we had an awesome experience.

2012-07-19,5.0,"I've been to Kuma's three times over the past few years, and each time I go it looks a bit less like a destination on a metalhead's pilgrimage and a bit more like what it really is - the best place to grab a burger in the Midwest regardless of who you are. I'll review my most recent visit, when I ordered the Famous Kuma Burger, a 10 oz. patty on a pretzel bun with a sunny-side up egg, bacon and cheddar cheese. Previously I had eaten the Southwest-inspired Absu and the barbecue sauce-slathered Mastodon, and this more than measured up to both of those phenomenal sandwiches. The atmosphere has certainly been toned down since my first visit, but to a neophyte, the tattooed (and often gorgeous) waitresses and deafening strains of metal (St. Vitus, this time) may still be a bit much. Still, it's not fair to call Kuma's a dive. A lot went into the restaurant's decor, and more crucially, its menu. Executive chef Luke Tobias is a madman with no boundaries as to what he'll put on a burger. That means the menu is equally filled with oddities (like July's Burger of the Month, the peanut butter-covered St. Vitus) as it is classics (the Famous Kuma is a simple masterpiece). And everything from the entrees to the house-made potato chips and fries is executed to perfection. I don't know if it's fair to say a burger joint is my favorite restaurant in America, but I'm often tempted to. If you're hungry in Chicago and you have a little time to kill, skipping Kuma's  should be considered a sin.",-0.8642,0.851,0.06,0.088,0.5263125763125764

We placed our order waited about an hour before waitress came over and told me she was just informed couldn't make the burger I wanted. Changed my order and waited for order. The burger was good not the greatest in the world. Large portions of fries. The waitress took burger off ticket which was a nice surprise.

The burgers were monstrous which I love. It was pretty good but definitely on the greasy side (which I guess any good burger is). Our waitress was very attentive and quick on orders and refills on drinks. The only problem I had was it seemed they had a problem with their ice machine on sodas and water. It was ridiculously hot that day and we all wanted some cold beverages. However, all were room temperature with little ice. When we asked what's up with the ice, she explained that it's due to the temperature, the ice keeps melting. We asked for just a couple cups of ice and she wasn't lying....the ice literally melted quickly right before our eyes. Haha.

My first time at Kuma's was late night and close to closing.  A couple of friends and I ordered our food which we all found to be tasty and well prepared.  Our server was pretty good as well.  The music can be a little on the loud side making it hard to have a conversation, but this did not stop us from visiting again. However, the second time a couple of friends and I went we did not have a good experience at all.  When the three of us went to sit down, my one friend sat in a puddle of water on her chair.  Her entire butt was soaked.  When the waitress finally made an appearance at our table (she had walked passed us at least three times without mentioning she was our server and she would be with us shortly), my friend informed her of the puddle of water that she sat in.  The waitresses response was I'm sorry and I'll talk to the bus boy about it.  Ummm...she did not offer a towel, free soda, ""would you like to speak to the manager""...I mean nothing.   So because we were hungry and waited a while to be seated we went ahead and ordered.  The waitress did not tell us about the special burger at all.  My friend ordered a coke and the waitress brought her an RC Cola because that's what the restaurant sells...but she never informed my friend that the restaurant did not have coke.  One of my friend's originally ordered her burger well done, but the waitress said it would come out burnt and that the medium well would have no pink.  The other two of us order medium well.  My one friend who likes her burger well done got a burger with PINK in the middle.  We pretty much were over our dining experience at that point.  We ate, paid and gave a 20% tip that was not deserved.   When my friend got up and her whole butt was still visibly wet from the puddle of water, I had to ask to speak to the manager.  He was not helpful and did not offer anything but reasons that it was not the restaurants fault because in all the years he has worked there no one has spilled a drink and did not tell them.  It was clear after telling him about our whole evening he was not interested in trying correct the situation at all.  We left with a bad taste in our mouths - no pun intended.  I doubt we will be back to Kuma's Corner anytime soon.",0.9935,0.793,0.151,0.056,0.4800828664799254

2012-07-11,4.0,"I don't live to far from this place and drive past it everyday I go to work. This place is banging! There's always a line anytime of day and time. I read reviews and the website and was excited to try out this place but didn't want to wait in the massive line. Yesterday I was getting out of work and my friend said he drove past this place. He said that there wasn't a line and that we should go check it out after I got out of work. I was game. I worked all day and was pretty hungry.  So a few things to get out of the way. This is a really small, tight place with a small kitchen so you have to have some patience. I can totally deal with that and appreciate it. If you can't tell by the menu, the surroundings and the music it's got a heavy metal rock theme. There's all kinds of random, dark art work everywhere and the music is really heavy and super loud. It was hard to talk to each other without shouting. We were sitting right next to each other at the bar. It was loud. These were the downers for me but it won't stop me from coming back. Now on to the food and the service.  As I mentioned above there's always a massive crowd and line. We got lucky and got there before the crowd started. It was about 7:30 on a Tuesday. We walked in and the hostess asked if we wanted a table or if the bar was OK. We're always down for the bar especially since it was just 2 of us. She quickly shooed away 2 people and there we were with our seats at the bar. We were overwhelmed with the drink and food menu and had a hard time deciding but we made our final decisions. We decided to order and appetizer and a burger and split everything. Let me tell you that was a really smart decision on our part. I had a hard time because I wanted to try the mac and cheese that I had been reading about and saw on the menu. I saw an order of it come out and it was massive! Everything that I saw coming out of the kitchen was massive. Back to the mac and cheese, the best part is you get to pick 2 of your own toppings on it. I'm coming back to check that out.  They have a really great beer selection of all craft, no main stream beer. This I can appreciate since I just moved here. They also have a full bar for those of you that need some real booze with your food. Our final decisions were the BBQ Pork Fries and the Mastodon Burger. The fries was a mountain piled with pulled pork covered with BBQ sauce, Jack cheese and garnish of green onions. This was seriously a mountain of goodness. The fries were crispy, BBQ sauce was the perfect tang and sweetness, cheese was melty and the green onion added a nice touch. Oh so good! The Mastodon Burger was composed with BBQ Sauce, Cheddar Cheese, Crispy Bacon and Crispy Fried Onions. We had a choice of fries or chips. We opted for the chips since we had fries. The chips were house made so they were crispy and greasy. This burger was massive and AWESOME! BBQ sauce seemed to be the theme in our meal. It was a great touch with the perfectly cooked burger. The crispy onions added great flavor and texture and anything with bacon makes it better. Love this burger! We finished our burger but we were still left with our mountain of BBQ Pork Fries staring us in the face. We couldn't do it. We took it home. Those fries could easily feed up to 8 people for some fun sharing. Bar service was decent. Since it's a small place with a small bar it's easy to grab the attention of the bartender. The atmosphere aside I'm definitely coming back because there's more food I want to try. If you check out this place make sure you plan ahead and fast for like 2 days.

To be honest though, what was better than the burgers was the mac 'n cheese. DUDE! I don't even LIKE Mac 'n Cheese but this was good! Wasn't too cheesy, had truffle oil or some sh*t in it that just made your mouth say ""what the f, gimme more!"" Seriously. It was crazy.

We went late afternoon on a Saturday and scooped up two seats in about 5 minutes, but also a 45min wait if we wanted a table. As mentioned above, metal music will be blaring, you have to at least enjoy this kind of music just a little. Our waitress was well versed in the music as well, so that was fun to talk about too. Beer selection was great, and had some real rare beers you might not see at your standard tavern. Now to the good part - the burgers! I got the July special, Saint Vitus, which consisted of chunky peanut butter, and your normal burger toppings. Sounds weird, but was pretty awesome if you like peanut butter. Expect a juicy burger, great soft bread, and fresh toppings. The fries are great and salty, but the chips are also equally as good. No complaints on quantity, you should come hungry because nothing is small. And if you are a picky eater, you might be out of luck because they really discourage any substitutions or menu changes. Not a problem for those of us that eat anything that doesn't move!  There are so many places to get a ""good burger"" and why go to Kuma's over an alternative gourmet burger place with no wait? Well first answer is the atmosphere, this is simply just a cool place if you are a metal/rock music fan, combine this with a killer beer selection and a ridiculous, huge tasty burger - you have a unique, fun place to visit.

I do find it funny they call out Vegans on their menu. On to the food. Their menu items are named for all things heavy metal...songs, album titles, bands. It was fun looking over the menu to make the connection. We ordered the Mastadon and the Kuma burger (the burger they were pimping out that month). The burgers are massive, so come hungry. The burgers were pretty good, I will say. The fries appear to be homemade, and they were pretty good. They have an item called the Slayer. It looked obscene, and I imagine you would burn in hell if you ate the whole thing in one sitting, so imagine my amusement when the three frat boys in the table next to use ordered one...each.

The wait for the food was a long time even though we ordered it as soon as we sat down. The waitress only came by to refill our drinks once. Come here for the food not the ambiance, and if you happen to like it, come back.",0.9718,0.897,0.097,0.005,0.42191358024691367
2012-06-28,1.0,"This was my third time to visit Kuma's, and after this experience I can promise it was my last.  I will preface my post by saying that I enjoyed my food, once I actually got it. The burgers are great, and the mac and cheese is prize-winning - but that all pales in comparison to the completely terrible service.  After waiting for over an hour and a half for a table for four, we were finally seated inside the restaurant, smushed into a corner where we could barely pull out our chairs. We waited over 20 minutes for a server, and no one came. We went to the bar to order our beers (first two choices were 'unavailable', even though they were featured specials. Back at our table, the screeching metal music was so obnoxiously loud that our drinks were moving on the table. We asked to be moved outside.  Once outside, we placed our drink and food orders for four people, one of whom was around the corner returning to the restuarant. No problems were pointed out at this point. After waiting 20 minutes, our friend sat down, just for our server to explain that they 'do not accept joiners'. I understand the idea that had he waited to place an order until over 20 minutes after ours, it would have been a problem, but all our orders had gone in at the same time. To save time here, I will shorten and say that we argued with the server, (who had pushed our three orders through, but held the fourth back), who got the manager, who swore at us and said it was all about 'turning tables' before stomping off with an unresolved issue. We explained that we would pay for our drinks, but that if they would not let us eat as a table, then we were going to leave. They walked away, without a word. Once they realized that our food would go unpaid for, they slammed down four plates and a bill, never returning to the table again. We had to pay seperately, and everyone lost their appetite over the needless arguing.  Our servers final words to us were: ""You'd better not write a bad Yelp review"" - So here you go you snarky little lady.  Looking back, I shouldnt have paid for the burgers, and it was $90 of wasted money and almost 4 hours of wasted time. Go to DMK burgers and enjoy their friendly staff, and burgers that are half the price and worth the 15 minute wait.",-0.9403,0.822,0.072,0.106,0.3485243055555555
2012-06-27,5.0,"5 stars for the food. 3 stars for the wait-time, but... It's worth it! Very consistent burgers and mac'n'cheese, very original toppings, and GREAT flavor combinations. Metal not your scene? Sit at the bar, where the music doesn't seem to be as loud. Or, just ignore it! Too long of a wait, but your addiction to amazing burgers is killing you? Ok. Here's a very candid approach to how my boyfriend and I dealt with that: Plan to arrive and eat at a non-traditional time, like 3PM on a weekday. OR Have a ""time killer"" plan. Show up, give your name, find out the wait time. If it's at least an hour and a half, put your name in and head to your ""time killer."" Ours, for example, was another restaurant/bar. Kill some time there, but don't eat/drink too much. Head back to Kuma's with about a 1/2 hour left of your wait time.  Order your burger/mac'n'cheese and a water (if you're on a budget), and FEAST. Frankly, the amount of money you spend at the nearby ""Time Killer"" is probably right around the same amount of money you would spend for an appetizer or beers at Kuma's.  Sorry, Kuma's! You're so delicious... but we've got to do what we've got to do! PS: I moved to Denver, and I miss this place so very much.",-0.9569,0.804,0.07,0.126,0.4965211640211641
2012-06-27,3.0,"I came. I ate. I was unimpressed. Nothing blows more than getting all pumped up for a long awaited trip to Kuma's Corner, and it just didn't live up to the hype. Big fat boooooo in my book. Now, don't get me wrong, it was good.  Was it good like mind blowing sex? Ehh...not even close. Let's start with the atmosphere. Ughhh. Sorry folks, but this place just isn't my scene. The screeching and screaming playing in the background ((also referred to as heavy metal)) was terrible enough to make my ears bleed. Not to mention it was loud enough to make anyone go deaf. Customers were packed in like sardines and I felt like I was literally eating on top of the table next to me. I could have also done without some of the nudie art. By all means, I'm the furthest thing from a prude, but having T&A in my face as I'm trying to eat isn't my idea of a good time. I hear it's nicer on the patio if I ever decide to get back there... The service kinda sucked. The saving grace was that we only waiting a whopping 10 minutes. On a Sunday. On Father's Day. With a party of 6. Apparently that's a rarity, so no complaints there. As for our server, she had a 'tude days looooooooooong. I felt like I needed to apologize for not being a raging carnivore who loves to indulge in meat and beer. The evil eye she shot when I ordered water with lemon and a side salad, could have killed someone. And don't ask about the waffle fries...they haven't had them in weeks, it's written on the menu, and they get fairly irritated if you ask. Yikes. Not to mention, from the time of order to the time of table also felt like forever.  As for the food - it was good. But I've had better. Since I'm not a fan of veggie burgers and pretty much avoid meat, I ordered Kuma's version of a BLT. ((Bacon doesn't count as meat, right?? I personally think it's worthy of it's own food group...)) When my sandwich came out, there was literally an entire pound of bacon on it. No joke. No exaggerations. I took off a few pieces and let the fam devour the rest. I knew I should have ordered the mac n' cheese...dammit.  The bf ordered the Kuma burger and shared the same sentiments as me. It was good, but nothing spectacular. ((Yes, I tried a bite)). With all the hype, I expected to have my mind blown. The rest of the group ordered a variety of their other burgers - all which included the names of heavy metal bands. The rest of the party thought the burgers were good as well, but only a couple thought they were phenomenal. As for the prices, I felt that $11-$14 for a 10 ounce burger with a stack full of accoutrements was more than reasonable. One burger could easily feed 2 people.  I'd go back, sure. But I'd opt for a patio seat and the mac n' cheese. I guess given the mass amount of hype around Kuma's Corner, I expected so much more. If you're in the area and there's not a long wait, it's worth checking out. I just wouldn't go in expecting to have a mind-blowing experience.",0.9916,0.766,0.153,0.081,0.546724245253657
2012-06-26,1.0,"This place is way over-hyped and frankly I could think of many better things to do with my time, like maybe, going to the dentist. The food here is just not that good at all, not to mention the incredibly rude waitstaff. We were in town visiting some friends for their birthdays and someone suggested this place. They said that the burgers are really good but the service sucks, well it turns out one of those was true. First, when we arrived the hostess said it would be an hour and 15 minute wait, so we said ok we will be back and we put our name down. We decided to go across the street to have a few drinks. About 45 minutes later we called from over there to see if by chance our table was ready. The lady that answered the phone said no we don't take reservations and said we needed to walk over there. As we explained to her again what we were asking, because obviously she wasn't listening or didn't understand our question. We said we were already there and were just wondering if our table was ready, she then rudely replied, ""I am not the hostess so I cant tell you that"" and she hung up.  So one of us ran over there and came back and he said our table was ready. So we finished up and paid our tab and came over there. Once we all got there, we then waited another 10 minutes approximately for them to seat us. Okay so far not so good, but unfortunately it only got worse from there.  We ordered our drinks as 2 guys from another party were getting yelled at by a waitress for going out the wrong door in the patio. So,the waitress brings back our drinks and has a glass over the top of one of the beer bottles. She then drops the beer and the glass breaks and the beer spills all over my wife's purse. I understand accidents happen and that is exactly what this was. Immediately my wife grabs her purse and screams, ""Oh my camera"" and pulls out her new DSLR camera and it is dripping in beer. Not only that, but she also had her Ipad, Iphone, another lens for the camera, and another smaller camera inside her Coach purse, you could imagine how frantic my wife was, as we all were, as she is pulling everything out dripping wet. So we are grabbing everything to try to wipe it off to prevent any damage, meanwhile the waitress is just standing there and says ""I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry."" Ok we understand but can you please get us some more napkins or something. Well that was the nicest she was all day to us.  After we kind of cleaned everything up, she acted like nothing had happened. She didn't offer to do anything for us as we were still wiping things off and getting the glass out of her purse. In fact, we ordered our food a little later after that and I asked for cheese on my burger, and she says oh that will be a $2 up charge, and my wife asked for a salad with her burger and she immediately says, ""that's an extra $2"". REALLY, after you just possibly ruined over $2000 worth of electronics, you have the nerve to even mention this. So we get our food and no one is really in the mood to eat much at that point, no one particularly loved it either, as we were all expecting this incredible burger we had heard about. Maybe it was just because what had happened up to that point. Honestly I have had better burgers for a lot less expensive, as many of the reviews had mentioned.  Anyways, the waitress never once mentioned anything to us after the initial accident and when she brings our bill, she just sets it down on the table, and says, ""do you guys need any boxes"". I look at the bill and she made sure to charge us for every single item that she possibly could. I simply paid the bill and didn't ask about anything or to speak to a manger, which I now fully regret. as we all just hurried and left as fast as we could. I actually left with a few pieces of glass in my sandal. Now, every time my wife opens her purse, talks on the phone, or uses her camera now, all we can smell is stale beer. Frankly, we should not have had to ask for a manager, after seeing the potential damage which she caused, the waitress should have been bending over backwards to make us happy and at least tell the manager what she had done. Nothing on our bill was even comped, but not only that, we were nickeled and dimed for every single item we received. There was no offer to take anything off our bill, or have the purse cleaned or replace anything that was damaged, she didn't even ask if we wanted to speak with the manager, absolutely no remorse whatsoever. I have actually emailed the manager 3 different times and still no response, obviously they are not too concerned!! Trust me, this place is way way over-rated, they teat you as if you are just lucky enough to be inside their restaurant.

2012-06-25,5.0,"Back again after a year and half since my last visit to Kuma's, I was expecting to wait for at least an hour before eating. We waited for about 1.5 hrs on a Saturday night, which I was pleasantly surprised about. Lucky for us, after a few beers at the bar across the street our table was ready.  We were seated on the back patio on a beautiful summer night. After ordering our beers, we started our meal with the sausage and grits fritters. They were deep fried, cheesy,meaty and damn good. After watching an episode a few months ago of ""Best Thing I Ever Ate:Garlic"", I knew I had to order the Plague Bringer. Topped with a garlic mayo, jalapenos, fresh garlic, tortilla strips and cheese I knew I was in for one hell of a burger.  As soon as the Plague Bringer reached 5 feet away from the table I could smell it. Garlic madness. I bit into it and couldn't even describe the taste. It was spicy from the garlic and the jalapeno and the burger meat was high quality. The only thing I wished was that since I ordered a medium burger it was a little over done. There was not even the slightest tinge of pink on the inside so I felt like I was missing out on a little bit of juiciness from the meat.  Other than that, I cannot say how phenomenal the combination of flavors of this burger were. A word to the wise: do not order this burger if you can't handle spicy foods.

I had three folks visiting from out of town.  I prepped them that there might be a huge 1-2 hour wait.  It was Saturday 730pm, perfect patio weather, so we were primed for a huge line.  I was amazed when getting there and there was only about 4 people waiting outside.  I was so amazed that I commented over and over again ""Where is everyone?"".  Although it was clear no one was there, I was still told that it would be 45 min.  ""No worries, we will get a drink at the bar.""  There were seats empty at the bar (amazing, I know), so the two ladies sat down and we ordered drinks.  One girl had a broken ankle.  The bartender told us that they can't sit there unless they order meals.  Clearly seeing a person in a cast, and only two out of four people could sit and eat, we just got up and stood by the door. Ten minutes later we were seated on the patio (I know that sounds unbelievable).  I thought we had won the lottery.  The patio tables seat about 6, but we were 4 people.  We put in our order, and immediately I called a buddy to meet us.  He said he was hoping on his bike, and asked me to throw in an order for him.  Our server came back 5 min after we put our order in. I told her a buddy was joining, and I wanted to add a burger to the order.  She said that no one is allowed to join the table under any circumstances.  Being Greek and from the restaurant business I was taken aback.  After a little back and forth, she basically said that there are no joiners regardless if they did or didn't order food or drink (this is not stated anywhere in the menu or at the host stand).  ""Do you want to see the manager?"".  ""Oh, hell yes I want to see the manager."" The manager Frank came out ready to rumble.  Not to bore you with the details, we went back and forth for at least 10 minutes.  He was throwing every crazy reason why someone could not join the table. Truly dumbfounded, I would not let this go.  He told me his extensive restaurant experience.  I let him know that I have a culinary background,  hospitality undergrad, and I'm Greek.  I was was freaking born in a restaurant.  And the one thing I have never heard of, is a restaurant refusing a joiner when clearly there was room at the table.  Frank assured me that he could name ten restaurants that would refuse a joiner off the top of his head.  The funny thing is that he started naming restaurants.  I told him to pick any one of those restaurants, and we can go together to see if they refuse a joiner.  I also said that I was not going to call my friend now that he was on his way, to tell him he wasn't allowed to sit down.  Frank told me that he would not be able to sit there.  I told him that I wanted to see him remove him from the table when he got there.  Eventually, he agreed he would be allowed to sit down when he showed up.  I didn't tell my buddy what happened.  I just gave him half my burger when he sat down, and watched my out of town friends sit in amazement.   Now I know why the wait has dwindled. Frank, I am waiting for you to take me up on this offer.  Loser pays.  I could use a free meal at a good restaurant.",0.979,0.819,0.111,0.069,0.46903794037940383

The experience began when we arrived and put our name in. We went across the street to grab a beer and appetizers a neighborhood bar to sit out the waiting time.  During our wait, I called over to see if our reservation had moved up on the list in order to gage if we should ask for our tab and walk over to Kuma's.  The lady who answered the phone was incredibly rude.  She would not connect us to the hostest and basically hung up on me.   Life is about how you deal with situations.  With that being said, our waitress broke a glass filled with beer into my friend's purse.  Things happen, we get that.  How she handled the situation was terrible. We had to ask for extra napkins as she just stood there.  My friend reached into her purse to pull out her dslr camera, ipad and a few other items which were completely covered with beer.  We spent time drying these items off in hopes to save them.  Despite the waitress watching us she did not ask if anything was damaged.  My friend's purse still has shards of glass in it and smells like an afterhours bar.  There was no offer to have the purse cleaned or replace anything damaged.  The waitress did not show any remorse nor was anything compt after this situation.   Now let's talk about the food.  They might have a creative burger menu.  But, the best burgers in the city?  No way.  The food was fine, not worth a wait.

The portion size for that appetizer is huge-""should"" be for 4 people, unless you are just a fried calamari fanatic. My husband and I only got halfway to the bottom of the basket.

2012-06-09,4.0,"Finally made it out here. Finally. We came around 3:30pm on a Wednesday - no wait for a table inside or on the patio. Clearly the patio was our choice.  Apparently they swapped out some of the regular burgers for former burgers of the month. All the burgers are on pretzel buns, thank the lord. I don't know why anyone would ever want another kind of bun. I got the King Bong: the 10 oz patty topped with mustard braised onions, garlic pork, white cheddar and fried prosciutto on a pretzel bun. It came out a little more than medium well. Not a big deal. The burger was good...I liked it. I didn't love it? The garlic pork on top was on the dry side which just made the whole burger seem dry. Other than that, the mustard onions and prosciutto were effing awesome. As a personal challenge to myself, and the fact that I was eating with two guys, I wanted to eat everything. No fry left behind. I did, while my friends didn't. Congratulations, I'm a fatass.  I sampled my friend's Howl (red wine braised skirt steak, caramelized onion, merkts, fried potato strings) and the Kuma Burger. Both were pretty tasty. I never experienced the waffle fries, but the hand cut fries were well seasoned and good. The majority of their beers are $5, and the selection is large enough for everyone to find something they'll enjoy. I love $5 beers. I came here expecting people to be assholes from what everyone says, but I feel like that only happens when you don't follow their rules or are generally annoying. My friends and I aren't high maintenance diners, so that probably helped. Our waitress was actually pretty nice. Fancy that. Kuma's is worth a visit. The toppings on these burgers are interesting combinations unavailable anywhere else, perfect for the glutton in your life. Didn't get to try the mac and cheese, because no one would share with me.

First of all, I don't mind lines or waiting.  I grew up in New York City.  I frequent Doug's and avec.  So I can understand showing up at 10:00 pm on a weeknight and being asked to wait.  But I can't understand rudeness or unwillingness to be helpful.  Kuma's, if you hate your customers, please post a sign outside so we know to leave you alone. We had a party of 7, and were told we couldn't sit together because their biggest table seats 6. Weird, but we decided to order drinks and wait for tables to open up.  The hostess pointed out that they are very busy, and suggested that two of us take the open bar seats while the rest waited for more to become available.  We politely refused to split up our group, which seemed to upset her. Moments later, I watched our hostess clear off two 4-person tables right next to each other, so I was surprised to see her approach three gentlemen who arrived much later than we did.  I intercepted, asked if our table was ready.  Her answer was simply, ""nope"".  She seated them instead. An hour after we arrived, she reminded us of the two open bar seats, as the kitchen was closing.  We insisted it wouldn't be fair for only two of our friends to eat, and tried to persuade her to let us use the remaining table for 4 and squeeze in.  She offered no apologies nor explanations, only pursed her lips and shook her head so hard I thought she had mutated into bobble head caught in a wind storm.

My fiancee ordered the Kuma burger (had an egg on it) medium and I ordered something with pears, brie cheese and pancetta, but ordered a chicken breast instead of the burger. My chicken sandwich was pretty good, it was tender, not overcooked and juicy. I liked the pretzel bun. The caramelized onions on the sandwich also added a nice flavor mixed with the pear. What seemed to be missing was my pancetta. There might have been one little piece in there, maybe. The fries seemed over cooked and not seasoned at all. Onto my fiancee's burger, he bit into that massive thing and ewww, the inside looked rare. It was soo pink. He also said the patty wasn't really seasoned. He ate about 1/3 of it. What caught my eye was the mac and cheese the person sitting next to me ordered. I decided to place an order to go. So over all, service was okay, wait wasn't bad, food was alright, but worth all the hype? Probably not. I prefer Burger Bar and Epic Burger. I must say I did take a bite of the mac and cheese right when I got home and it is incredible! It's really cheesy, but not overly saucy. We added bacon and mushrooms to it.

We waited a bit for the initial order to be taken, but after that it was smooth sailing.  We started with Calamari off a friend's suggestion and it was SALTY.  I mean I could feel my fingers swelling... SALTY.  I liked the idea of adding the cherry peppers and lemons in the fryer, but the batter was a bit much.  The lemon aioli that it's served with was tasty. I ordered the Y.O.B. (Smoked Gouda, Bacon, Roasted Red Peppers, Roasted Garlic Mayo).  I ordered it medium well, it was mushy raw in the center - I didn't send it back cause it wasn't tragic enough.  It was a good burger overall, but again not fantastic; I've had many better burgers elsewhere.  My husband ordered the Kuma Burger (Bacon, Cheddar, Fried Egg )  I stole part of his perfectly runny egg.  He seemed to enjoy it.  We agreed afterward though that it wasn't that special.  We could take it or leave it.

But none of that matters once your server sets your plate down in front of you and there's a behemoth of a burger proudly sitting atop a pretzel bun like a Greek God on Mt. Olympus (cue heralding trumpets, rays of sunshine). My fave is the Megadeth. Chorizo and tortilla strips on a burger is just so right (its toppings also include red potato hash, pico de gallo, and avocado). I haven't seemed to be able to order anything else since I've had it. My first time at Kuma's I had the Judas Priest, which has bacon, apples, walnuts and dried cranberries. It was good, but the topping to meat ratio was off. There is a LOT of meat in these burgers. Good meat. Order yours medium rare and you will get it perfectly cooked, well-seasoned and delicious. The pretzel bun is the perfect wrapping for this gift from the food coma heavens. The restaurant is super small, so large groups are not a good idea. By large, I mean like four or more. I've always just come with my boyfriend and we've never waited more than 20-30 minutes, but most of the time we can just snag bar seats within 15. And sitting at the bar is awesome because you have faster access to all the beers. And they have banana bread beer. Need I say more? I will anyway. The bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable; tip them accordingly. You will definitely slip into a deep slumber after eating at Kuma's, and you will dream of bouncing up and down on huge meat patties while being showered in tortilla strips and craft beer.

I went today at lunch right when it opened and sure enough there was a wait right around the corner when we got there and when we left - NO CHANGE *BEER LIST* - They didn't have my usual any longer (Purple Haze) but they still had some pretty awesome beer. Two good ones we had were the White Rascal Wheat and this Peach Beer. Yum! Also, they have spreckers root beer on tap. Genius - UPGRADE *FOOD* - It looks like they cleaned up the menu a bit since I've came last. No more goblincock (hot dog on top of burger and not that great) and they added an Arkansas burger with wine bbq sauce which my husbers said was pretty good. I had the metallica spicy buffalo burger which was my regular and it was still the same. I like that they now serve regular ketchup with the fries not spicy ketchup. Now I no longer have to sneak in regular ketchup packets.  My only complaint was they got rid of the Waffle fries.  *Drop to knees scream WHYYYYYYY????!!!!!"" It was such a nice compliment to the burger! They've replaced them with regular cut potato fries. They were kind of shriveled not crisp and just blech.

If you know how the weather is in July, you can already imagine how muggy it was then. There weren't any indoor tables available to fit a party our size, so they split us up to sit in the outdoor patio. It was about 105 degrees with humidity altogether, but we all sucked it up for the sake of experiencing some delicious burgers. Luckily the patio tables came with picnic umbrellas....OH WAIT, ALL but ONE!  Out of all places to put this umbrella-less table, they decided the smartest place would be smack in the middle of the patio. What genius made that decision? Why not put this unfortunate table in one of the corners where it could gather some shade from the wall of the building? Oh, and you can guess that's where my half of the party sat for this disgraceful lunch hour under the beating, sweltering Chicago sun. Yah, its heat and what can you do? You can't tell the sun to F-off, but judging from the sweat beads pouring down from my peers faces our patience with the heat was running low. Other guests had finished their lunch and left leaving perfectly shaded tables open. When we had asked our waitress if we could move tables, they gave us the stupidest answer ever. They rejected our request and said that if they do that, they would lose their table to the other waitress and they don't usually allow that. That is moronic! Does it really matter THAT much? And they added that they didn't have any extra umbrellas. So then I said very politely, ""well maybe you would consider to move this table away from direct sunlight and somewhere in the shade next time"".

No Miller on Bud products here. They also have whiskey on tap. After all, it is a metal bar. Does Kuma's Corner live up to the hype of a top burger joint?  Absolutely Yes, and it well worth any wait!

Is it packed? Like none other, but the faithful wait faithfully. In fact, if you've ever guzzled beers in between bands at a packed concert & still found a way to have a good time, waiting for a table is a very similar experience...except for the part where the beer list is effing phenomenal, the girls slinging them are outgoing & knowledgeable, and by the time you get a table, the food is worth every minute you've spent waiting. I'll cut to the chase: the original Kuma burger is one of the best I've had. The food showed up in a totally reasonable amount of time, considering the number of bodies in the place. There were enough good Belgian-style beers on the menu to send me off tipsy, and they played enough solid 80's & 90's metal interspersed with the newer stoner variety to keep me more than happy. I was never a huge metalhead, but a mix of current & nostalgic is a good way to placate the masses...well, except for the people two tables over that felt this was a reasonable place to bring toddlers. Nice parenting, y'all! Really didn't notice the burger king literally next door? Anyway, put a night aside & do it. Unless you're into Enya & all you can eat sushi.

Yes expect a lot of fucks in this review gang, its a fucking review of a heavy metal burger bar so you better have brought your big kid pants. The first thing I noticed (other than the huge crowd) when I entered was WHISKEY ON TAP. Yes you read that right, whiskey on tap. Fuck yeah #1. Fuck no #1 came almost immediately after noticing the whiskey when I was informed it'd be an hour for a table. No problem.  We are not men easily deterred so we settled in with some Zombie Dust and found a seat on the window ledge while we waited. The wait ended up not even being an hour long and it was actually quite enjoyable wait between the brootz on the speakers, the great craftbeers in hand, and the good company of my brotatoes. Once seated I didn't even look at the menu. I knew what I was here to do before I even left the house. I had come to attempt to slay burger who gets its namesake from my favorite thrash act: The Slayer. This ""burger"" totally lived up to the hype and its name. I had come to slay and had been slayed myself. This is not a burger for any man. This is a burger for the gods. Covered in chili, fries, chorizo and I don't even remember what else it more resembles what a meal probably looks like in your stomach than an actual burger. What I'm saying is this thing is awesome and you get the Slayer. On my second visit I got the High on Fire per the recommendation of our waitress. It was also fantastic but more typical spicy burger kinda thing going on. Like I said also loved it but it was no Slayer. My date got herself a Megadeth and had nothing but good things to say. Now keep in mind this is HUGE considering she's a former vegetarian and this was her first taste of red meat in 8 years. My only complaints really have to do with how busy it is here. You always have to wait for a table and when you get one you're usually rushed through your visit by the staff trying to keep things moving.

2012-04-09,5.0,"So, I have been long overdue with writing a review on this glorious establishment, so here goes! This past weekend I came here for my third visit in the last 1-2 years. Every time that I have visited Kumas the food and the service has been incredibly consistent, which says a lot about a business. It's nice to see that with its hike in popularity that it hasn't gone downhill or changed itself drastically. We arrived on a Thursday around 5:30 and had a 40 minute wait, which wasn't bad at all. The music wasn't at a deafening volume yet, so our party of four was able to congregate around the bar and have a beer while we waited. Their beer selection has a great variety of craft brews that is always changing, which is a great feature. Three of us decided to go with the Three Floyds Zombie Dust beer and the other person in our party went with a Dog Fish Head brew, and we all were content sipping on our beer and scoping out the diverse crowd. You can definitely tell the difference between the regulars who actually look like they fit in with the heavy metal atmosphere and are normally seated at the bar vs those who come seeking a delicious burger. Although the 40 minute wait went by fast, it was treacherous waiting and being teased by all the burgers we saw being served and could smell being grilled. Once we were seated, we ordered another round of beers. I was excited to see the Dog Fish Head ApriHop on the menu, and upon seeing that my decision was made me for me. My boyfriend and I decided to get an appetizer for the table and split a burger between ourselves, as the 10 oz burger is a feat for one to take alone (although, easily doable once you begin eating it and your body demands more of the deliciousness). After debating between a few of the appetizers, we went with the pulled pork served over the french fries to whet our appetite for the burgers. Let me start off by saying that this appetizer was ENORMOUS and could've easily fed at least 2-4 more people. The pulled pork was drenched in BBQ sauce and covered in cheese, and in spite of its size, was devoured within a few minutes. I was surprised to see that since I was last at Kumas that they have switched from their waffle fries to traditional fries. They were still tasty, but I do like a good waffle fry. After debating between several burgers, we finally decided on one that we would like to split, which was the Pantera. This burger was outstanding. There's something about the roasted poblano pepper that really made this burger stand out, and it was greatly accentuated by the two types of cheese, bacon, and the sauce. Also, the tortilla strips on this burger were fantastic, and I'd venture to guess that they were homemade. Our halves of the burger were quickly gobbled up, as well as the side of fries that came with it. The other people in our party got the Iron Maiden (which is my tried and true standby) and the Brujeria and were extremely enthusiastic about their choices throughout the meal.   I absolutely love this place, and I will definitely be back sometime in the future. For as much as I love their burgers, they are still only #2 on my list of favorite burgers in the city. Owen & Engine still stands above it because their beef is so much more flavorful and the simplicity of the burger greatly outshines Kumas. Although this being said, Kumas has great combinations of toppings that makes the flavor of the meat less crucial.",0.9979,0.852,0.14,0.008,0.5301515151515152

2012-04-02,4.0,"I navigated my way through a cold, dark January night in Chicago to come across Kuma's Corner. I mean, a burger joint where all the burgers are named after metal bands - how could I resist? I rolled up solo and the hostess told me I'd have to sit at the bar. Taking a look around, I could already tell this was going to be a while. The place was packed! Metal music blasted from the speakers (which you get used to after the first 15-20 minutes or so). I started trying to scope out a bar stool in anticipation. She told me a lot of people at the bar were probably waiting for tables and would clear out in a bit. Yeah, that bit turned into almost an hour. A smarmy long haired rocker patron who appeared to carry himself with the air of being ""a regular"" rolled his eyes at me when, after offering me passage to the bar, I told him I was waiting for a seat. (I get the feeling he leaned in to his friends afterwards, muttered ""Tourists!"" and had a good laugh at my expense, but whatever.) After watching people's mannerisms like a hawk watching for a dying field mouse, I spotted movement at the bar's far most end near the kitchen. Were they leaving? There was still a jacket on the chair - I wasn't sure! He came back for the jacket - YES! Oh wait, but who's water glass is that? I asked the patron at the next bar stool if anyone was sitting there. He said no. VICTORY! I snatched the seat as quickly as I could, ordered a local beer & readied myself to order. I'd already peeped the menu and wasn't going to delay getting my grub on any longer: I ordered the namesake Kuma Burger and prepared to wait another 20 minutes for it to come out of the kitchen. (The place also takes 'to-go' orders, so be prepared to wait for your food twice as long.)  Finally, my burger arrived, a delicious yellow yolk stared back at me atop the succulent and perfectly charred burger. I took a bite and was in heaven. Perfectly medium, nice and juicy, bacon was crisp but lacking in flavor; the yolk penetrating in the meat to perfection. Fries were decent - appeared to be hand cut. Bun could have been a little bit more toasty but was soft and succulent, helping to soak up some of the grease & yolk. Was it worth the wait? Maybe. I was starving so my judgement may be a little flawed. But if you're willing to wait and you love head banging while enjoying some beers, bring a friend and drag them on over to Kuma's!",0.9971,0.801,0.171,0.029,0.5032669815564553

2012-04-01,3.0,"Picture the scene: EXTREMELY loud music and twice the people (maximum capacity is 42!) packed all into one small corner bar. Everyone is so packed together you're breathing down each others neck. The atmosphere is more of the heavy metal side.   I walked into the bar, put our name down and the hostess said 1:45 min wait. Boy she wasn't wrong! We stood cramped together for more than two hours waiting for a seat. By that time I was expecting a golden hamburger after that wait.  Finally we were able to get a seat, right next to the blaring speaker (bad luck?).  The waitress came and took our drink and food order because after waiting more than 2hrs we were definitely prepared to order right away. 45 minutes went by till we received our food.  During that time the waitress was inattentive with our drink order, maybe its because we were the only people in the bar not drinking beer? who knows.. I finally had to catch the waitress in action for our drinks. So we received our food I had the Mastodon (BBQ sauce, cheddar, fried onions, & bacon on a pretzel roll). The pretzel roll is barely toasted so your eating a warm burger on semi cold bread...not what I expected. The bacon was extremely chewy like it had been sitting under the heater for quite sometime. The BBQ sauce was good as was the fried onions. OK, let me just warn you the burgers are probably two pounds each (a meal in itself) that is why they charge $13 for the specialty burgers. The kaijo is only $10.  They also give you a heaping amount of fries along with your burger. The fries are very salty as well.   Side note: I heard the MAC & CHEESE is better than the burgers, sadly we never ordered it that night. So what it all comes down to, is I think this place is over-rated. There are way better burger joints in Chicago with less longer wait.  It's a shame because alot of people I know rave about this place. I might have to go back next time to try the mac & cheese though.   P.S--- if you don't want to wait in that huge line tip the hostess, I've seen a few people do it.  They were behind us, and somehow ($$$) got ahead of us.  Smart move, I wish I would of thought of that first.",0.9756,0.895,0.084,0.021,0.5286004645760742

2012-03-31,4.0,"It's hard to believe I've been a ""foodie"" in Chicago for a few years but had never been to Kuma's. There's a cult following and is considered an institution locally and nationally. It's a small, heavy metal ""bar"" so seats are very limited and wait times can get absurd. Luckily we sent Erica ahead to put our name in at the open because we needed a rare table for six. We were celebrating Jean's birthday (Erica's mom) with her family.  I didn't know what to expect but everything was true to form. It's a metal bar with like minded employees, graphic posters and enormous burgers on pretzel bread (though it's still very family friendly). Just for added emphasis the list of rules is as follows - 1) We do not take reservations. 2) We will not ""put on the game, bro""  3) No music requests. 4) No Minors after 10pm. 5) Our kitchen is only 166. Please be patient. The menu is 20ish burgers and a few other sides/starters. Not to be missed is an order of customized mac n cheese. The small is enough to feed six people and absolutely fabulous.  All of the burgers are named after rock bands including Led Zeppelin, Pantera, Black Sabbath, etc. I went with the Plague Bringer (Roasted Garlic Mayo, Tortilla Strips, House Made Hot Sauce, Fresh Garlic, Pepper Jack, Sliced Jalapenos), and other selections at the table included the Neurosis, YOB and High On Fire. Everyone only ate half a burger because consuming an entire one, with fries and mac n cheese would be a triumph. I really liked my Plague Bringer with a nice dose of heat but great meat a nice garlic mayo for balance. I also think the pretzel roll idea is awesome because that is not a flavor normally associated with hamburgers.   Is it worth all the hype and hyperbole? Mostly yes and an experience worth having. The scene is fantastic and unique as well as the concept. The mac and cheese was outstanding and burgers are creative and tasty (and huge). You can find equally enjoyable hamburgers in this town for much less hassle which is the only reason I don't crown Kuma's the best thing to eat in Chicago. I would love to go back and try more variations and eat more mac but the logistics are very challenging.

2012-03-29,4.0,"A very impressive burger, indeed. A 10oz patty is the standard here, so burgers are huge...and named after metal bands. I had the Mastodon, which comes with bacon, cheddar, bbq sauce and fried onion strings on a pretzel roll. I skipped the fries and went with the house-made potato chips. They were excellent but could be extraordinary if they served them hot. I suppose the small kitchen prohibits it. The burger was fantastic. The medium rare patty was a bit overcooked, though. Not terribly, but enough to notice. The combination of fried onions, bbq sauce, bacon and cheese on a burger is a classic one and Kuma's version is one of the best. They also have several local (Midwest) beers on tap along with a few microbrews from around the country. I had a delicious IPA from Michigan, I believe, and a draft root beer from Wisconsin- also delicious. The list of rules is mostly based around food service but there are a few zingers in there about no ranch dressing, no games on the TV, no Miller or Budweiser, etc. Things that most hipsters find clever, but in reality are kind of lame. It's weird, I got this angry vibe from all of the written paraphernalia, like the list and their website (all caps diatribes about how you should spend your money, what music to listen to, shop local, etc.), but the folks working there were as sweet as could be. I was a bit confused to be honest. Either way, they make a damn good burger. A must visit while in Chicago.",0.9581,0.747,0.151,0.102,0.6183333333333334

We were on our way to Hot Doug's and after seeing a freshly dead squirrel on the side walk we thought we should check o make sure they were open. of course, they had closed minutes earlier. In search of delicious food, we turned to yelp and Kuma's Corner became our new destination!  We get there and there's a huge crowd!

The menu at Kuma's has NO VEGAN OPTIONS, but plenty of beer options. I opted for a light beer from a local Chicago brewery and the mastodon burger. I'm a huge fan of BBQ sauce, which the mastodon was full of, oh and the opinions piled on top were fab. The burger was cooked to perfection and the fries were nice and crispy. I wasn't a big fan of the ketchup they offer, but extra BBQ sauce worked out just fine!  Despite their bad ass appearance,The waitresses at the bar were super helpful and friendly!

2012-03-23,5.0,"After three trips here, I think it's finally time to draft my review. Kuma's is burger mecca. Every time I go I am reminded that I could look far and wide and never, ever find a better burger than this place. If you ask for medium-rare, they give you medium-rare - unlike everywhere else which gives you the same shade of grey regardless of what you order. Kuma's pretzel rolls are also the best I've ever had which certainly adds to the experience. In terms of ambiance, Kuma's is a heavy metal mar with an extraordinary beer selection and burgers that are almost exclusively named after bands who made a living growing their hair and biting the heads off of innocent animals. You should know, too, that pictures of topless women with blood coming out of their mouths can be found all over the walls. Admittedly, I haven't been to a ton of heavy metal bars but I assume this is standard. As you probably know, you shouldn't expect to simply walk into this place and grab a table. Spots at the bar open up pretty frequently and, on a weeknight, you'll typically see a thirty minute wait. I've never even tried to make the pilgrimage here on a weekend so I can't speak to how busy it gets on a Friday or Saturday. In conclusion, eat here. Get in the car, drive farther west on Belmont than you've ever been, and enjoy the best burger of your life.",0.9645,0.901,0.092,0.007,0.49778911564625855

An hour goes by, then an hour and a half and then two hours.  By this time everyone who had been waiting with us had already gotten seated and then left and plenty of people who arrived after us had gotten seated and left. Upon inquiring with the rude hostess about how much longer we had our party was informed that they only had 2 six top tables and one had just been seated and the other didn't look like it was leaving anytime soon and maybe it would be another hour long wait or more depending.  I don't mind waiting at a place if fully informed but never did the hostess tell us that it might be better to split up our party because the wait might be up to three hours or longer.  I understand the ambiance of a place like this but that is no excuse for poor service.  Your burgers might be good, but they certainly aren't good enough to deal with your poor service on top of a two hour wait.  We left and went to Piece which is fabulous and which I have waited for up to an hour or more for a table, but they have good service.  Should I decide to try Kuma's again with a smaller party I will update this review, but it probably won't be anytime soon.",0.954,0.819,0.116,0.065,0.42422161172161166

You also have to try the mac and cheese........and get ready to bring some home. Time your visit though. Its always packed and quoting 2 hour waits.

2012-03-01,5.0,"We went to Kuma's last Saturday..... It's been a crazy busy week so I'm just now getting around to the written review, but, trust me, it's been reviewed and praised via friends, face book, and anywhere I could fit it in.   I love a great meal - I hate having to wait, but we were definitely forewarned and we took into account it was Saturday.  Kuma's opens at 11:30. We were there 11:35.  First great thing - close FREE parking.  The two hour wait was a little more than I expected but what the hell - we had driven 34 miles for the burger of my husband's dreams.  Being a vegetarian that never goes hungry, I figured the adventure would be worth whatever I ended up eating.  Little did I know how AMAZING mine would be too.   It was a nice day so we opted to wander during the first part of our wait.  Ended up stepping into ""The Pork Shoppe"" with the idea of having a beer.  Another highly rated place that per hubby was incredible.... he decided to have a little appetizer there.   We checked back in at Kuma's - we were 5 parties away..... or we could grab a seat at the bar; first come first served - which is where we ended up.   Gotta tell you - yes the place was PACKED and yes it was LOUD, but everyone there was/is so nice.   Meat loving hubby had their special.... marinated skirt steak on the burger with other stuff.  He looked exceptionally pleased with his choice - even the side salad was ridiculously good.  Fabulous basil vinaigrette - I'd go back just for that. I had the well hyped and loved mac and cheese.  I added caramelized onions and mushrooms.  It was without question the BEST I had ever had.  Yes, I would definitely make the 34 mile drive and deal with the two hour wait again and again to go back for this treasure.  I hear adding bacon to the m&c is the bomb..... I'll have to trust 'em.   Portions were huge!  I definitely over-ate at the meal, took home left overs that ended up being an additional 4 lunches for hubby and me.  He brought home 1/2 of his burger letting him relive his amazing burger.   Let's not forget their fabulous beer list, fun and knowledgeable staff and over all great experience!  Hmmmm.... I'm free this Saturday; perhaps we should go back.   Go, eat, enjoy!!",0.9992,0.657,0.294,0.049,0.5538839285714287

2012-02-27,5.0,"Mmhmmm, burgers. Served by an attractive waitress with full sleeves (tattoo sleeves that is) which give her an aura of both sexual and terrifying. It's kinda like sleeping with your boss's daughter: you know you shouldn't be doing, it's most likely going to end horribly wrong for you, but you can't help but be drawn to it. Sorry, where was I? Ah yes, burgers. I absolutely adore a good burger, and there are so many damn elements that must come together. Pretty much anyone can toss a meat patty on a grill, flip it a few times and shove it between two bits of bread with some cheese. And sure, that's technically a burger, but it's not a Burger and that's what I really crave. Lucky for me, one of my best friends, Tori D, lives in Chicago and is hip to the good places to eat. I don't mean fancy (although she knows several of those), I mean the ones that leave you drooling at the sight, stuffed to the gills, and in foodie nirvana without emptying your wallet. Now that's a good place. On my last visit to Chi-town, she insisted we make the trek out to Kuma's Corner. The description of it as a biker gang/heavy metal bar was a bit alarming but I figure if she could survive it then I could hardly back down. So we grabbed a mutual best mate and the three of us got there before the place opened and joined the line. Yep, even 30 mins before opening time there was indeed a queue to get in. That's saying something. Orders in and about 20 minutes later the food arrived. You do have to be patient as the kitchen is quite small and demand high, but they have excellent beers on offer and the music is enjoyable and not overwhelming which allows you to have a chat. I opted for the Plague Bringer (how can you resist a name like that?) which was a beast with roasted garlic mayo, homemade hot sauce, crunchy tortilla strips, and jalapenos. The burgers are a full 10oz of juicy tender meat piled high with toppings and served on a pretzel bun. In case you were wondering, the bun is made of the same dough as a pretzel but isn't shaped like the traditional bow. Which is good as you'd be spilling even more of your food down your shirt and we'd have to make you wear a bib and nobody looks good in bibs. The fries are crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The waffle fries are always a good treat. A pretty wide range of quality beers (and I mean quality...not just variations of Bud and Miller) will help wash down the copious amounts of food. We were warned by Tori D that she usually only eats half the burger so of course Jesse and I took up the challenge and demolished ours in one sitting. We may have had to roll out the door and passed out shortly after getting home, but that's not really the point. Overall, it ranks near the top of my burger list and is a definite stop the next time I'm in Chicago.",0.9977,0.788,0.166,0.046,0.5178842592592593

I've been here four times and every time I've been impressed.  The YOB is my favorite burger so far. The only thing that failed to impress was the cheese fries.  Cheese didn't really stick too well to the fries and tasted a little over cooked.

So when I was in town again a couple weeks ago, I was determined to eat one of their burgers. My friends and I went and waited a good hour on a perfectly crisp Sunday afternoon. I was ready for my burger. Our table got an order of the mac and cheese (w/ prosciutto and sweet corn), and we really enjoyed that. I think prosciutto, or bacon, is a necessity in mac and cheese because of the saltiness it brings to the dish. After going back and forth between multiple burger choices, I settled on the Lair of the Minotaur. I love all of the toppings that accompany that burger, but it was the Bourbon-soaked pears that reeled me in. Coincidentally enough, that was what killed the burger for me. The flavors of the pear just did not go with the burger. I had to take the pears out to make the burger decent. The patty was well cooked (medium-rare), so I had no complaints there, but I would say this is a good burger at best; I've definitely had better. Everyone else at my table got their burgers medium or medium-well, and those were definitely too dry in my opinion.

I went in kicking and screaming (figuratively) because I didn't feel like waiting 2 hours for a burger. I remember being annoyed, frustrated, starving, claustrophobic, and outright pissed while I was waiting... then we got seated. I ordered the Mastodon - I think - and had a few of their awesome beers (great selection!) while my stomach continued to growl. The food actually came out pretty quick considering the overall wait, and the size and thickness of the burger was impressive while the smell the ingredients on it was downright intoxicating. We all bit into our burgers at the same time and - I swear to god - we all made the same sort of MMmmmmmmmMMMMmmmm sound in unison. At that moment, everything else - the annoyance of the long wait, the cramped environs, the growling on my stomach - all just went away, I only cared about how amazingly the burger was. And those burgers are big, so my appetite got filled real quick.

Let me emphasize that last point - I flew from San Francisco to Chicago rather than Indianapolis (which is A LOT closer to Purdue) just so I could have me some Kuma's. It's that good.

A window was open (most likely due to the grill/stove smoke?) and the January breeze had a strong bite to it, so my partner moved her chair to the other side of the table but was promptly asked to move it back due to ""strict layout rules.""

2012-02-01,4.0,"2.5 hr wait for a table, unknown wait at the bar, or 20 min wait for a to go order?   Those were the options presented to me and my friend. We opted for the to go order. It seemed like the obvious choice since it was the fastest, and we weren't necessarily that interested in dining in the restaurant. Too bad that 20 min slowly turned into over an 1 hr. That's pretty ridic in my book. Sure, they're super busy and yeah, they operate out of a tiny ass kitchen but come on, that seems like an unusually long wait for 2 burgers and an order of mac and cheese. If that's the norm then that's cool. Just tell me. Don't fool me by telling me 5 more min every time I ask where my order is. Take a lesson in managing customer's expectations. You'd have a 5 star rating if weren't for that because your food is outta control good.    The burgers were really good, but I wouldn't say they're the best I've ever had. They were huge, and the topping combinations were creative. I ordered the Brujeria. Cream cheese and chorizo stuffed jalapeno popper on my burger? Hell yes. My friend had the Kuma burger - can't go wrong with a fried egg. But what made this meal outstanding was the mac and cheese. They should just open another restaurant that serves strictly that because it's amazing. It's so rich that you know every bite is bad for your health, but you don't care because it's just that damn good.  Where do I begin to describe it: noodles cooked al dente with a perfect balance of mushroom and panchetta.

I've been here more times than I can count and will be going back much more!  A big plus is that they are VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY. Most of the burgers can be switched out with a garden burger  which I think is amazing. The fried jalapeno poppers are pretty amazing in my opinion, and the raspberry jam that goes with it makes for a surprisingly delicious combination. The ""OUR FAMOUS KUMA BURGER"" is something that is always a great go-to option but their long list of burgers and other food will never do you wrong.  Can't decide? Got a favorite metal band? It probably comes in meal form and will not let you go down. This includes the Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Slayer, and Led Zeppelin burgers among others and each are very delicious.

Trust me, this place is notorious for long waits. We got lucky. A two beer wait time is the same as being seated immediately in a place that's only 16 x 6.  People stay and drink without any consideration for people who just want their turn to eat. Common courtesy from people who are tatted, pierced and tortured? Eye roll please! I haven't been able to go back for another tastegasm; until now! When the patio is closed for winter, Kuma's opens its phone line for you to call ahead for pick up.  The menu is complex but impressive. The names they use and the description for their ingredients make it hard to remember what I ordered the first time that made me want to go back. NEUROSIS! How could I forget when this place makes me neurotic!  It's a 13 dollar, 10oz piece of meat of my choice: Hamburger, Boneless Chicken Breast, Garden Burger, or Chicken Tenders that is fired up with Cheddar, Swiss, Sautéed Mushrooms, Caramelized Onions and Horseradish Mayo on a Pretzel Bun.  It comes with Waffle Fries or Homemade Chips. For $2 more, you can swap for a House Salad. You won't find Miller or Budweiser products or Sports on TV. It would definitely clash with the metal in here! The establishment is small. The layout is open concept. Be sure to wear layers of clothes when you come here during the winter months.

2012-01-23,5.0,"If you love punk rock and/death metal, this is your place. If you crave one of the best burgers in the city, give Kuma's a try. If you love burgers, but hate punk or death metal, you'll just have to grit and bear it (ha ha!), my friends, cause Kuma's food and drinks are worth the bleeding eardrums.  When you first walk up to this place, you'll notice two things: [1] the sign ""Hippies [and Hipsters] Use the Back Door"" (this is the first of many rules) and [2] the crowd of people waiting outside (even at 11 am, before the place even opens). Once you are able to get inside, the music will be blasting, there'll be a super-gory horror film on the flat screen, frames of creepy art on the walls, and an oddly friendly (considering the atmosphere) and eclectic group of waitstaff and bartenders ready to get your experience going. A couple of rules to be aware of: you can't add people to your party/table after you've been seated and there's no splitting checks. Oh, and no one under drinking age at the bar. Did I mention no hipsters? The stars of the Kuma menu are the burgers: super fresh and cooked to order (you ask for medium, your actually getting a medium-cooked burger. I haven't seen a burger actually cooked to what I ordered in so long that I was a bit shocked). All the burgers are named after rock bands and the ingredients/toppings range from expected to artery-clogging (fried egg and bacon, anyone?). They also have a great range of beers and some really tasty specialty sodas. As for sides, I've only had one thing: the waffle fries. They always come out hot and well seasoned. And with homemade ketchup! But wait, I forgot to mention that they serve their burgers on PRETZEL ROLLS! Can you feel my excitement? The only downside to Kuma's is that it can take a while to get your food. But I think that is the price you have to pay for great food at a popular spot. TIP: if you are coming for the food more so than the atmosphere, get there right before it's open. There will already be a line at the door, but you'll get seated sooner and the music isn't quite so loud. But personally, the atmosphere is half the reason to come in the first place; it'll get the blood flowing for the mind-blowing culinary experience you're about to have.

(2) The service leaves something to be desired - everyone working seemed angry with life and really unhappy to be there. (3) Going mid-day is best, anything past 4:00 and you'll wait in line for a table for well over an hour. (4) The food took FOREVER to get to us (1 solid hour after ordering!!!) (5) If you've got no where to go, these burgers are WORTH it. Quick notes on the above points... don't bring kids or anyone over 50, seriously. The place is small, and the death metal music is DEFEANING. This is NOT a place for the young or old, just on the music alone (never mind the pornographic S&M artwork on the walls and in the bathroom!).

2012-01-15,3.0,"FAMOUS FOR: - Burgers in general - Whiskey (barf) on tap BUZZ - Make Your Own Mac & Cheese - Beer Selection - Lair of the Minotaur Burger - Black Sabbath Burger (6/10) I ALSO TRIED - Mastodan (5/10) - Jalapeno Poppers (5/10) Even though some friends tell me I can't make a final decision until I try one more burger, I've been here twice now, and at least I can start tying some characteristics together. First of all, having ""struck out"" twice, I can put to bed the myth that ""everything is good here."" You know, with this many 5 star reviews, it's hard to believe you can get anything less than stellar, but I guess I have a knack for finding faults first. BEER SELECTION They've got a very nice selection of beer. The list fills 2 columns on a single page and they have all sorts of craft beers from all over. While I do enjoy craft beers, I don't like craft beers with food, because the taste gets lost. With a burger I'll enjoy a Heineken or Miller Lite, but they don't have any ""common"" beers here, only craft...and I respect that. MASTODAN My signature burger of choice is a ""Western Burger,"" which is a burger with cheddar cheese, barbeque sauce, grilled onions (or crispy onion strings), and a pickle. I get this at random joints, bars, and Smashburger. When I saw that the Mastodan fit that to the T, it was a ""No Duh!"" decision. A hyped up burger place where ""everything is amazing"" and my favorite burger? Gimme Gimme! Well, one major thing that stopped this from getting better than a mediocre rating is that the patty, 10oz, was devoid of seasoning and didn't have a lot of flavor either. It sort of acted like a black hole, sucking in flavors out of everything else into oblivion. The BBQ sauce was light, onion strings were hardly noticeable, and cheddar wasn't sharp enough for my liking. It certainly wasn't the worst western burger I've had, but it's beaten out by joints that have Yelp review counts in the low double digits. One of my buddies, who insisted I tried Kuma's, had this as well and also admitted, he didn't like it very much. So, at least it's not just me not understanding the hype of Kuma's, but it's agreed that the Mastodan isn't good. Ok. Fine. I'll give it another shot. BLACK SABBATH BURGER So, between my Mastodan experience and this, I watched Diners Driveins & Dives to make sure I don't go rogue and order something popular that put Kuma's on the map. According to Guy, the Black Sabbath is a ""Fan Favorite."" This is a burger with homemade chili and jack cheese. Watching them make the chili on the show got me real excited. So, my first bite of the burger, I taste the chili for a split second, and then the beef patty rushes in and snatches the flavor away, like the Mastodan did. First, let me say, I'm not a big Chili person. I like it, but I'm not crazy about it. The Chili here is amazing! I've tried Cincinnati's chili and all that stuff, but this is the real deal! It's got a good kick, incredible flavor, and beautiful seasoning! If I could just have the chili in a bowl, I'd be in heaven! But...I'm having it on this flavor-sucking patty. I tried some of the patty by itself, and you can taste the salty/peppery/spicy flavors they put on it, but it's very light, and same goes for the seasoning. This is all completely cancelled out, though, when you make it in the form of the burger. JALAPENO POPPERS Nothing spectacular. The jalapeno raspberry jam isn't too bad, but it's not exactly complimenting. It's close, but something just contrasts. The jalapenos are ok, the cream cheese is a little much, and chorizo is hard to find. Go to Jersey's for poppers. I'LL BE BACK? For a place this popular, I'm really confused as to why I have such bad luck with this place. I've got a good number of Yelp Elites on my friends list, and they're all giving this 5 stars too, so there must be something I'm missing. I will definitely be back, but it's not because I'm craving anything, it's because I'm determined to find out what it is that makes this place so enticing for so many.

I tried some of my girlfriend's Pantera burger and this was the bomb! Just the right amount of spice with the Poblano pepper and Ranchero sauce.

2012-01-05,4.0,"Many are deterred by the gruff vibe, soft core porn playing behind the bar, S&M-themed art, tattooed waitresses, heavy metal music, and 2+ hour waits. Kuma's is definitely worth all of these.  Kuma's is a unique Chicago dining experience. The beer list is short but sweet (with multiple offerings from the similarly metal-minded Three Floyds brewery on tap). They have whiskeys (including Buffalo Trace) on tap. However, if you're reading this, you're coming for the burger. I've had two, and each was spectacular. The Absu comes with tomatillo sauce, avocado relish, and deep fried chilies - burns at both ends, but extremely worth it. Tonight, I went for the Earthride, which is topped with four (count em, four) kinds of bacon (pancetta, Canadian bacon, regular bacon, and bacon jam) - Jewish heritage be damned. Ordinarily, I don't love places which top their burgers to oblivion, but Kuma's does such a great job with this otherwise tired concept that I have to give them credit. Plus, the burgers are all massive (10 oz according to the menu, but they feel more like 12 to be honest), are actually cooked to your desired degree of doneness, and served on impossibly soft pretzel rolls, so I'd bet the plainer burgers are pretty decent anyway. I could dock a star for the fries, which are just okay, but I've come to the conclusion that they just add to the awesomeness of the burger by comparison. In short, you should abandon all your preconceived notions about the non-gustatory elements of a pleasurable dining experience, and come to Kuma's.

Lair of the Minotaur is my personal favorite, but you wont go wrong with whatever you choose. I hear their mac is great, so i'll have to go back soon to ensure reviewers are correct. For I am the mac of mac's (just rolled my eyes at myself...) They opened 20 mintues before their stated open time. Got crowded fast. I sat at the bar on a rainy afternoon after I closed a sale. So I was feeling good. Ordered some good beers from a place with a nice selection. Service was fast paced, sarcastic (which I dig), but efficent.

(ok maybe 2 or three pushed together but still), so once you put your order in, it will be a little while until you get your food but this doesn't matter due to alcohol.  They have a full bar; awesome beer selection both on tap and in bottles, they have whiskey on tap, and FANTASTIC bloody mary's.  They use stout in the bloody mary's and its awesome.  The most recent trip I had the black oak arkansas and loved it.  It will be hard to not order this again next time I go.  We also had an order of the completely custom mac and cheese to go, which took us two days to get through because it was HUGE.  Bacon + garlic + mac 'n cheese = heaven Oh and the staff is awesome!  Some people may think the staff at a bar playing metal will be surly/angry but that couldn't be farther from the truth.  The bartender who waited on us was extremely friendly and I hope next time I go we have the same one.

My boyfriend (a meat eater) had been raving about Kuma's Corner and was dying to take me there.  I expected it to be serviceable at best, since I'm a vegetarian.  Boy was I wrong.  This was one of the best veggie burgers I've ever eaten... to the point that I will dream of my burger and most certainly plan on going back multiple times. The heavy metal themed restaurant brought me back to my upstate New York roots and I loved the music and death metal-inspired burgers on the menu.  But I'll get right to the good stuff... I had the Absu.  [note to self:  resist urge to make ""absu-lutely delicious"" pun here].  Red onion and avocado salsa, spicy tomatillo sauce, pepperjack/queso fresco and most importantly, a phenomenal veggie burger, served on a pretzel bun.  Every single part of this burger was amazing.  Seriously, my mouth is watering just writing this review right now. If you're a veg and have eaten a veggie burger out at a bar before, you know that it's a real mixed bag in terms of what you're served most times.  My favorite veggie burgers are the Morningstar brand, and the burger at Kuma's was just like a Morningstar veggie burger, only bigger and better. Kuma's is very accommodating of non burger eaters.  All of their burgers can be served as veggie burgers or grilled chicken breasts, which is nice when you're trying to accommodate multiple dietary restrictions/preferences in a group.   Expect a wait no matter what time you get to Kuma's.  Typically it's about a 1 to 1.5 hour wait to get a table.  If you're a party of 2 you can probably hop right up to the bar and get served there, but if you're waiting for a table, plan on eating a snack ahead of time so you don't starve while waiting.  The one thing I can guarantee is that Kuma's is most definitely worth the wait.  I promise.     So delicious.  Go.  Now.",0.9908,0.823,0.155,0.021,0.5062912964228754

2011-12-07,4.0,"On my latest visit into Chitown, I had to try Kumas after hearing so much about it.  My buddy and i were warned of the terrible wait so we ventured out first to get our name on the list while waiting for the 3rd member of our party.  After putting our name in, we were able to snag 2 seats at the bar quite quickly (apparently grabbing bar seats can be quite difficult here?) so we considered ourselves lucky. We ordered some beers (good selection but wished the menu would give more details on each beer) and decided to try out the jalapeno poppers (we were waiting for the 3rd member to share the mac and cheese).  Well, let me tell you about these jalapeno poppers. It was like having a Thanksgiving meal all at once in one bite (I went around Thanksgiving so maybe I automatically associated them with it but my buddy agreed). These were the BEST jalapeno poppers I have ever had in my life. These are not your normal jalapeno poppers. These are chorizo stuffed jalapeno poppers and it came with this raspberry jam that went so well with it.  OMG so delicious. I will go back just for this. When the 3rd member of our party arrived, we waited just a bit longer and were seated at a table.  We ordered the mac and cheese with proscuitto and broccoli and shared 2 burgers (megadeth and black oak arkansas).  We didnt have to wait too long for our food and we were all ready to dive in.  The mac and cheese portion size is GINORMOUS... even if you do not eat a burger, you cannot finish this mac and cheese by yourself.  Proscuitto and broccoli were good with the mac and cheese although I wished there was another veggie green to pair with the proscuitto (you know... arugula?).  Now that I've had the mac and cheese at english, I will forever compare every fancy mac and cheese to it and this just wasn't as good not that it was by any means bad. Would I order next time? Yes.  Both burgers were good - good flavor, good pairings with the toppings and fairly priced because the burger is massive. Thankfully we split the burgers amongst all because I definitely cannot finish a burger by myself and burgers never taste as good later on.  Overall, I was not disappointed but my wait time was under an hour and those jalapeno poppers really made my night.

Toppings...ample and impressive-looking. Pear/Brie...maybe they should soak their pears in a cinnamon/clove simple syrup or something, because all I tasted (including the bun and patty) was Brie rind. Blue cheese...piquant, but couldn't taste the onion strings. Maybe add maple to the bacon?  Sorry to report that my favorite burger remains a semi-fast food one.

Their current success is well deserved, and I have no problem waiting for 2 hours to get a table on a Friday night. The food is never disappointing. With all this praise, it's curious why this isn't a shining 5 star review. Let me start with, the food is spectacular, the beer options are mind blowing, and the music is outstanding (yes I love how loud it is).  The reason for the 4 star review is because of lack of menu flexibility. Back in the day they use to have waffle cut fries ( WAFFLE FRIES ), and that was a huge plus for me, there is something about looking at the fried mini potato waffles that makes eating them an experience, well beyond anything you can experience with potatos cut and  deep fried in any other fashion. Next, they nixed the burger of the month. Back in June 2009, the burger of the month had grilled onions and mango, sounds off the wall, but that is exactly what made it so epic. They have started to play it a bit safe and it is a letdown.

Simple-- Kuma's can make any burger with a delicious in-house made veggie burger! As a note though, Kuma's is NOT vegan friendly. However, if you are a lacto-ovo vegetarian as I am, the food is outstanding. On my first trip, I wasn't in the mood for a burger (and was nervous about what type of veggie burger patty it would be), so I decided to try their made to order Mac n' Cheese. Wonderful! You can choose from a variety of add in ingredients and cheeses. The portion is so huge, I ate a lot and barely made a dent in my bowl/plate. You really get a lot for the price! On my second trip, I decided to give the veggie burger patties a try. I am so glad I did. As a vegetarian, when I order veggie burgers at some restaurants, they vary in quality. Too dry, fall apart, no flavor, etc. etc.  I will go on record as saying that Kuma's has the best veggie burger I have ever had. I ordered the Neurosis burger that comes with sautéed mushrooms and caramelized onions and a variety of cheese (I substituted cheddar for smoked Gouda cheese).  The only reason I am giving this place four stars instead of five is because of the music. Not the type of music, just the volume. I get the idea that metal is supposed to be played loud, and I really do like some heavy metal. But I think they can have louder than usual metal to have that hardcore atmosphere, but not so loud that you have to scream at the people you are eating with. However, I doubt that will change anytime soon based on Kuma's ""f*€k you"" attitude. Wish is cool... But seriously, turn down the volume.

You think that the money spent isn't worth the fact that the burger is made fresh, that the meat is seasoned beforehand instead of you just slopping it with ketchup, that the moist insanely good juice dripping down your face and your burger while you sit there in this burger mecca one-of-a-kind experience just isn't worth the extra few bucks you're spending here. 3. You came during a Fri or Sat night when all the reviewers on Yelp tell you that you'll have to wait in line and then you were completely surprised that you would have to wait for awhile.  4.

We grabbed a couple of beers at the bar. Within 10 mins there was a sudden influx of people and it got very crowded by the bar. The fact that the kitchen was 20 feet away from where we were standing made our wait a bit torturous. However, over all, it was worth the wait.  I decided to go for the Kuma Burger. Portion size is not an issue here. I love burgers and I was barely able to touch my fries since the burger was massive. Some come in with a huge appetite. The Kuma Burger had an egg on it. The combination is pretty amazing and I'm beginning to think anything with an egg added to it just tastes amazing. (FYI..go to Boiler Room and get the Cuban Pizza, comes with an egg as well).  For my own taste, it was a bit loud. However, when you're chowing down on a burger, it doesn't leave much room for conversation.

Amazing mac n cheese to begin with, and the Jalapenos added a nice little heat. I'd go back for the mac n cheese alone. Here's the thing, the burger itself is good. It's a big 1/2 lb slab of meat and cooked perfectly and is very moist, but not sloppy with grease.

I love a good burger and Monday is usually a slower day for restaurants so we went at lunch time. As expected there was a wait but it was very short. After we were seated the line became really long so we must've arrived just in time.  We started out with the BBQ Pork Fries and the Kuma and High On Fire for the main course. Everything tasted great but we both favored the original (as expected) and washed everything down with some tasty non-Miller and non-Anheuser products. I really like the idea and the food is great but it's not THAT great. I think this place is more hyped up beyond what it is actually capable of but that's common for a place that becomes trendy in Chicago.

Bottom line is they make a great burger and it's worth a try at least once in your life if you're in the area.

2011-11-05,3.0,"Why did I not give this amazing burger place five stars? Well, the people. I came to Kuma's Corner understanding that it was a rough place, very unique and interesting. I did not expect it to be like any place in Lincoln Park or Lakeview that I frequent but I was okay with that. On that same note, I do not appreciate rudeness from staff for any reason. If I wanted to eat at Dick's Last Resort, I would have been treated better and not had to wait 45 minutes.  My roommate and I went on a Friday and we were there promptly at 11:30 am when Kuma's opens. Well, it was already packed. I do not mind waiting at all, it is a testament to amazing places in my experience. My roommate and I were able to snag a bar seat, only to have the bartender/waitress tell us that we couldn't sit there since my roommate is 20 (I'm 21). Well, since Kuma's has more bar space than table space (and it was 11:30 am) I was sort of outraged. She asked her manager if we could just sit and eat and he said absolutely not. We went back to the hostess and she informed us that in the time when we were trying to work out the bar seats debacle, three groups had come in and even though we had come in first, we would be moved to the back of the line. Alright, fine, whatever I'll wait the 45 minutes even though there were numerous bar seats open.  More and more people came flooding in as we waited by the window. I watched as they moved this poor group sitting at the bar five times during the course of their meal. I am not against switching tables or moving down a seat to allow more people to sit, but five times? They also carded two men who were older than my father. Really? Do you have to card everyone, even seventy year old men? All in all, I found every staff member (with the exception of the hostess and our waitress) to be extremely rude, unorganized, and not worthy of a tip.  Once we finally sat down, at a four person table with many groups of four waiting and getting very upset, our waitress did a great job. The food was amazing, I will not deny that I loved every bite of my heart attack on a bun. I had the Megadeth burger which I recommend if you like a little kick to your burger. My roommate had the YOB (red pepper) and she said it was fantastic. I am not a fan of red pepper (especially an entire half on my burger) but I will trust her judgement because she is an excellent cook herself. The fries were alright, I've had better at DMK. Our waitress kept our drinks coming and I appreciated it since my burger was burning my mouth (in a good way). I will only comment on the stench and loudness of the music once. I left smelling like grease and grime since my roommate and I spent two hours in the establishment from start to finish. The music was extremely loud but I will accept that because this is the atmosphere of the business. I don't expect them to change the music and smell when I walk in just because I'm from Lincoln Park. After hearing many amazing things about Kuma's, I expected this place to be outstanding. While I did get an amazing burger that I will be back for (and bring my father to when he comes to visit) the staff was extremely rude. I have sat at many bars and restaurants under the age of 21. What is  with this policy? Don't tell me that it's a law because, in that case, many high end establishments in Chicago broke the law by allowing me to sit at their bar and eat. Kuma's almost seems to try too hard at being cool. I'm all for metal and being unique but when being rude is your only attribute, you need to do a reality check. I will stay in Lincoln Park if it means that I can be treated like a real human being.

So the food is so amazing that people come from miles around to get their hands on that greasy, drippy goodness.  And that popularity, paired with accolades galore makes an often crowded place.  The neverending crowd had led to a long list of rules, to keep the masses in line.  This place has more rules then a set of conservative parents with a teenage daughter.  Seriously there is a list of them by the door and a few more at the bottom of the menu and some more listed online.  Ironic that a place that embodies a free spirit and a 'I don't give a __' attitude has so many rules.  Maybe they enjoy playing ringmaster and watching us struggle with the hoops.   But I suggest you read through them, it'll make it a little smoother.    So some advice:   -go during alternative times so you don't end up waiting 2 hours -bring cash because you can only use one card per table   Now on to why people are willing to put up with all of these rules, the food.  I got the Neurosis burger.  The giant burger came smothered in caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms, swiss, cheddar and horseradish mayo all on a pretzel bun.  Now the toppings are what make these burgers special but the burger itself if dynamite on its own.  Cooked to a perfect medium rare, it had such a great flavor.  Seriously you could just go with the patty and be happy.  Pair that with the first Great Lakes Christmas ale of the season and I was a happy girl.",0.9903,0.827,0.143,0.03,0.6362698412698413

If you do go, plan on waiting at least an hour for a seat and another hour to get your food.  I'm very impatient and hate waiting for anything, but the food here is worth every minute.  It is a little easier to get a seat in the summertime because they have an outdoor patio that basically doubles the occupancy of the bar.  In short, the food here is amazing and definitely worth the wait.",0.9551,0.827,0.131,0.042,0.5316666666666667

I went with two of my buddies. The staff was super nice, but the wait was THREE FRIGGIN HOURS! Did we wait? Of course we did! There was a ton of cool people outside the bar, and we walked on down the street to a super hip bar called Square. That's where my awesome experience ends I wish we would've stayed at Square. I was stoked once we were finally seated. The place certainly has an ambiance. Blaring metal music, bondage-esque paintings, a super creative menu & a punk rock staff is what this place has going for it. I ordered the Iron Maiden burger which is topped with avocado, cherry peppers, pepper jack cheese & chipotle mayo. Sounds AWESOME right? Wrong! My burger was dry, the toppings weren't fresh, and my cherry peppers tasted more like maraschino cherries. I was totally put off, and pretty pissed. My other friends had similar experiences and we vowed never to come back to Kuma's. Bottom line - Awesome theme & ambiance, but the burgers (at least for my friends and I for when we went) were lackluster.

2011-10-28,2.0,"My wife and I wanted to try this place since we had seen it on WGN News as well as a few other programs on the Food Channel. We had tickets for the Blue Man Group nearby so we took this as an opportunity to try Kuma's. We waited outside for about 30 minutes and didn't even make it through the door that night. We had to leave to be able to make the show, although we allowed more than ample time to do both. We did however make it a point to come back the next day at a less crowded hour.  That night we had a Philly Beef at Clark Dog just down the street from the Briar Street Theater; I wish we had just gone there first cuz it was sooo good. And that was only partially enhanced from waiting sooo long at Kuma's and smelling the burgers with no possibility of getting one any time soon. I think it was about the best Philly I've had (I haven't been to Philly yet for the originals, so I don't really know...). We arrived at Kuma's at about 2:00PM on a Saturday. It still took more than 20 minutes to get seated. Once seated it took about 15 minutes to be acknowleged by the waitress.  We ordered and the food was up pretty fast. We also ordered the fried calamari and a couple of beers. The beer was somewhat warm, but as I'm German, it didn't bother me TOO much. More bothersome was the large pool of grease that had collected in the bottom of the serving dish for the calamari. It had fried, battered lemon wedges which was unique, but it failed to make the squid taste any better. We both abandoned trying to eat it after only a few pieces each. Although the burgers had been hyped up by the media, we found the burgers to be disappointing. They were so run of the mill that my wife can't remember what she had, and I can barely remember the Megadeth that I had. Both burgers were large and thick but pretty dried out. I'm a great one for balance, but there was way too much burger for the bun, and way too little toppings for the burger; I might as well have ordered a personal meat loaf or something.  We had both ordered them medium but both came well-done. The pretzel bun was good but nothing a good Kaiser roll doesn't have too. The most notable and memorable feature of these burgers was the very fine grind of the meat. It had to be at least double or possibly triple ground beef (they almost seemed the same texture of a good meatball). They were priced in about the correct range that I had expected, and although the service and taste were somewhat lacking, we difinately did like the rock 'n roll atmosphere. When we pointed out the beer temp, the greasy squid and mentioned that we wanted medium, the waitress looked at the burgers and told us that they were medium and promptly dis-appeared; we never heard anything after that about any apology, recompense or perk. With that being said, I think in the future I will simply go to a rock concert and get a Chili's burger to eat on the way there instead. I can't really find it in my heart to give more  than 2 stars since it failed on several levels, but it remains a unique twist on hamburger nomenclature and old heavy metal bands. P.S. Remember this is a bar, and not necesarily a family place because of some of the slightly risque art on the walls (As well as on the patrons and staff too!).

2011-10-18,3.0,"This is not a burger that you want to order if you have a timeline on when you need to leave. To enjoy it, you'll want to take your time eating it. I went for the Kuma Burger; bacon, cheddar, and a fried egg just sounded too good to pass up. Why fried eggs aren't standard on all burgers is a mystery to me. The burger came out and it was thick, extraordinarily thick. I had to eat most of the burger in upper/lower half bites. There is a lot of meat in the patty and it is thick. I asked for medium rare, but it came out well done. I think they just ask how you want it cooked out of courtesy and then cook them all the same regardless. The bacon came thick as well and had the cheddar melted over it. It proved to be too thick. I found myself battling it throughout the whole meal. It's hard to enjoy the burger when you're fighting to bite through the bacon in every bite. The fried egg, sunny side up is cooked well with a runny yolk. I question the decision for a runny yolk on a burger. It just makes it messy and falls to the plate, but this burger is too big to handle to dip into the yolk prior to each bite so it doesn't work here. The bread is pretzel bread and was an excellent choice for sandwiching the massive burger. I know, my review reads like a 2.

2011-10-16,5.0,"Kuma's Corner has burgers so good it is worth everything else you have to put up with to eat there. No matter what day or time you get there, you will be faced with a long wait time. In my experiences here it has varied from 45 mins. to 2 hours. With any other place that would be unacceptable.  The wait time is largely due to their extremely small (16x6) kitchen and the large crowd the restaurant draws in on a daily basis. The kitchen is too small to meet the demand which causes the long wait times. Also, the atmosphere of the restaurant could be a little off putting to the more conservative. It's very heavy metal themed. With metal music blaring nonstop in the crowded environment, heavy metal decor filling the walls, and a heavily tattooed staff, it can be a lot to ask someone who is not a fan to put up with all that for two hours. Once you do get a table and place your order, you have another wait ahead of you. As mentioned the kitchen is quite small, so even once your order is placed you have about a half hour more to wait. But then you get your food and you understand why it was all worth it. I'll start off with the appetizer. Their ""Make-Your-Own Macaroni & Cheese"" is amazing. Like everything they serve there, it's done a little differently. You get to choose two (or more, paying more for each over two) toppings for the appetizer. When I went with my 3 cousins we agreed to get it with garlic, bacon and chicken. I have never had a more unique and delicious serving of macaroni and cheese in my life. Splitting it between 4 people still somewhat filled me up, but I made sure to save room for what was coming next. You cannot go to Kuma's without ordering one of their famous burgers. Like the restaurant they are heavy-metal themed with names like ""Lair of the Minotaur"" or the ""Metallica"" and many others all with their own unique toppings and served on a pretzel roll. My favorite is the Mastadon. A 10 oz. burger topped with BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, bacon and frizzled onions. These burgers are massive. You almost ponder if your mouth can handle the first bite. Once you do take that bite though, your mouth is treated with a blend of flavors so overwhelming it takes a while to comprehend what all you just tasted. Kuma's knows what its doing when it picks these unique toppings for each burger, blending them perfectly. Each topping compliments the last. The meat is unmatched by any other restaurant I've been too. So thick and flavorful and fresh. And the pretzel roll adds a subtle detail to each burger that is definitely the cherry on top. It is a challenge to finish the burger in one sitting. You almost feel exhausted after devouring one.  The item on the menu I would say needs the most work is the fries. They've recently made the move from waffle fries to fresh-cut, which is definitely an improvement, but they still taste pretty bland. If they could get the fries to a level of being half as delicious as all the other food they offer Kuma's would be an unstoppable powerhouse. So, while your initial experience with Kuma's Corner may be unsettling, stick around. You will see why it is worth the wait.",0.9957,0.861,0.118,0.021,0.5568187830687832

Shockingly it was terrible.  The fries were soggy and tasted reheated with salt poured on them. The Kuma burger was dry and salted beyond belief. (typically my order is cooked medium) I've never experienced this before, it literally tasted like an entire bag of salt was dumped on my plate. Sad thing is that it wasn't just my meal either, four burgers around me all suffered the same(not all of them were Kuma). Over salting?! Remember beef bouillon cubes? Yeah those tasted less salty than my Kuma burger.  The whole night was bizarre, I walked up and got seated with NO wait which never happens there. Perhaps someone knew that Benny the Bull was doing his popcorn prank but instead with a bag of salt in the kitchen?

It was 75 degrees, sunny and I'm sure majority of Chicago was outside embracing the beautiful weather before winter. Thank god they were all out and about because there was no wait! Most of you know the notorious Kuma's wait.  So while everyone was out enjoying one of the last days of nice weather, I was gracefully downing a neurosis burger (sauteed mushrooms and caramelized onions) along with fries and mac and cheese. I shared the mac and cheese (with scallions and mushrooms) with 3 others and then ate half my burger and almost all my fries. Everything I ate was perfect, delicious, perfect, delicious, perfect, and perfect. Burger was perfectly medium rare. The pretzel bun is AH-MAZING!  Mac and cheese is everything I want in a mac and cheese. Cheesy but not too cheesy. If I could eat here everyday if there were no calories in anything.

2011-10-07,4.0,"I have been going to Kuma's for years.  Probably been there around 15 times.  It's still the best burger I have ever had.  I've tried burgers all over the city and none come close. The Pantera is by far the best burger creation in history.  It has a range of flavors that hit your palate in precisely the right order: first you taste the sweet-salty pretzel bun, then the green chili paste adds some spice, leading you into the perfectly cooked meat patty, then the bacon and cheddar balance everything out, before being taken to a whole other level when you hit the tortilla crisps.  Damn. I gave it four stars because everyone STILL misses the waffle fries.  It has been five months and people still talk about the loss of the perfect side.  Whereas the waffle fries were simply salty and crispy, and could be dunked in the spicy ketchup to enhance the flavor of the burger, the new fries are greasy and actually mute the flavor of the burger.  I'm sure some people like the new fries, but why not just have both? Anyway, Kuma's kills it every time, new fries notwithstanding.  The music and atmosphere are great, the waitstaff tend to know a lot about their massive beer list (and can even pair beers with burgers if you ask nicely), and the prices are actually pretty reasonable (though they recently raised every burger to $13, with the exception of the $15 Slayer due to its size and the pleasure it provides the user, and the $10 classic Kuma's burger). There's a wait.  Stop crying. I will be going to Kuma's for years to come.  Or, at least until I have a heart attack.",0.8519,0.836,0.097,0.067,0.5627919405697184

We waited about an hour and 20 mins and everyone had been seated that was in line before us. Still waiting, a group of annoying yuppies girls (about 6 or 7) came though, went inside and never came back out. HUH? who were these people? I went in to sneak a peek to find them sitting down! When i approach the hostess and told her we had been there for well over an hour, she apologized explaining they were FRIENDS of the owner but we would get the next table. HOW RUDE and what a horrible way to run your business. Not to mention i felt the burger was good but not spectacular. The mac n cheese here is good but expensive. Second experience went better, only a 20 min wait i believe. Having this burger the second time around was less impressive, lacking seasoning and quality of meat seemed less than par. Bottom line.. way to small, ok food,  not worth a wait over 20 mins and you take the chance of getting pushed to the back of the line.

Now that I've established my credentials, I have to say Led Zeppelin is so far my favorite.  I don't care what time of day or day of the week you go, you should expect to wait. Once you've ordered you'll be waiting again. They're working with a small kitchen, but they try their best. When you get your burger you will find the wait was worth it. The fries suck so I usually go with the chips.  They also do a build your own mac n cheese. I added bacon and andouille to make the best mac n cheese on Earth. The portion is gigantic. I shared it with two friends and we had a very hard time putting our burgers away after. The loaded fry appetizers are gigantic as well. I tried adding the bacon and blue cheese topping to my regular side of fries instead of ordering a full appetizer portion, but they wouldn't accommodate my request. They explained that due to the size of the kitchen they don't go off menu. The beer selection is relatively extensive. If you're like me you enjoy good beer, but don't care to be all that educated on it. You can't go wrong with any of the rare selections. There is no cocktail menu. Think Jack and Coke.

Considering the up to 3 hour waits, lack of ventilation, and loud blasting metal (btw I almost exclusively listen to metal), you are in for a long uncomfortable evening. To ease the discomfort you will be pounding alcohol which is very fun, but might make it hard to really take in the greatness of your burger (or remember it) because you will eventually emerge having eaten the best burger that money can buy. For the burger alone this is a 5-star restaurant. I don't fault the restaurant for the wait times, they actually handle it incredibly well and the staff is extremely nice. Visiting Kuma's at least once should probably be required by law if you live in Chicago and eat burgers.

The restaurant has limited seating and you will wait for hours. -The cooking time. It took 25 minutes for our burgers to reach us. Understandable as the kitchen/grill looks like 6 by 8 feet. -Speaking of the kitchen/grill, it is right beside the open bar so you and your clothes will smell like smoke after having great burgers. -Albeit creative in naming the burgers from heavy metal bands, I have no idea why Metallica, Black Sabbath etc are those kinds of burgers.

I purposely picked a later flight in the afternoon, out of ORD's degenerate cousin airport Midway, in order to eat here before I went back home to california. From being here before I know this place can get crazy crowded, like no place I have ever been to before (the closest would be maybe Anjin, but that still pales in comparison). So i decided to get there right when they opened at 1130 on sunday. Well it happened to be raining that morning so they let everyone waiting outside in 15 minutes early and because of that when we got there at 1135 there was all ready over an hour wait for a table of 4. The problem was we where there with 8 people, which they wont sit a table for that many people, so we had to split up into 4 and 4, so it was going to be damn near impossible to get two tables next to each other.  On top of that we went there with some younger kids, age 9,7,6 and I completely forgot there was naked pictures of women on the walls...whoops :). But hey they still loved this place cause the food kicks ass! One last tip, if you hang around the hostess you will have a better chance of getting a table, as we did, and because of her I was able to catch my flight and stuff my face with kumas before it! I got the Mastodon burger ( yelp.com/user_local_phot… ), which in all honesty didnt blow me away and I found the amount of onion strings they put on top to be a bit overpowering  and really took away from the burger. But besides that one issue, the pretzel bun, burger, bacon were stellar as usual and the bbq, instead of catchup, was a superb choice by them. Honestly, I would stay away from this burger, unless you really really love onion strings, and this is the only reason i gave it a 4 instead of 5 stars. Also, they did change the fries from waffle fries (which I was told were frozen) to a fresh-cut fry. I am still of fan of the waffle fries, regardless of if they where frozen or not. The other thing we got was the mac and cheese ( yelp.com/user_local_phot… ) and got it with bacon and broccoli. This stuff was freaking amazing and could have killed someone if you ate the entire plate of it. it was uber gooey and the bacon and broccoli cut a bit of that and added some crunch.

Soggy, luke warm.  Never once did they come out perfect.  If I order a burger and fries, I want them both to be fantastic.  In addition to the fries being sub par, the place usually smells like old french fry grease.  I used to live in the area so I went often but when I found better burgers using better meat, I jumped ship.   Who knew that the FIreside Inn uses Angus Beef, pretzel roll & house cured bacon on their FIreside Burger?  The actual burger is 10x more tasty than Kumas and the fries are always right.  So is the price $8.95.  My only suggestion is that you ask for the bun toasted because it doesn't come that way.  By far the best Burger(s) that I have ever had have been at Rosebud Steakhouse, downtown.  They use sirloin trimming from all of their steaks. So, it tastes like a steak!  They have jumbo pretzel rolls perfectly toasted.   Another top notch burger can be found at The Golden Steer out in the burbs.  A bit of a drive for a burger but burgers don't get much better than this.  They were just featured on Check Please so I'm guessing one of my favorite secret spots has just been revealed.",0.9969,0.762,0.238,0.0,0.5623626373626374

We went fairly late on a weeknight so the wait was only about 2o minutes, and we expected the food to take a while (nearly an hour!). What we did not expect was to be treated like criminals! My friend and I went here for a late dinner and had plans to meet another friend at a bar later after she got off work. Well, she ended up getting cut earlier than expected and came to meet us for a drink while we ate. We did not know she was coming until we had already been seated. When our friend arrived I asked a neighboring patron to use a chair from their table and he politely obliged. The waitress rudely said we couldn't seat our friend there because it blocked a pathway between tables. So I suggested we move the chair next to where I was sitting where it did not cause any problems. I was then told that we simply were not allowed to pull up a chair. I then offered to share my seat with her and was told that was also not permitted! The people at a 4 person table behind us were leaving, so we asked to be moved to that table and were told they wouldn't do that. The manager ended up telling our friend she could sit at the bar, which she did even though she couldn't have a conversation with us from there. They then had the audacity to tell her that if she wished to sit at the bar she needed to order a drink! Our food still had not arrived, so I asked to have our order cancelled because we wanted to leave at this point. We were told we cannot cancel an order and that if we left without paying they would call the police! No one in our group even said anything about leaving without paying. Worst experience ever!!! We ended up getting to go containers once our food was ready and left. The food: fries were absolutely delish! Burger was mediocre and was not cooked the way I ordered it.

Kuma's is so smoky I was quickly reminded of how my hair used to smell after a night at the bars before the smoking ban (I had to give it a good scrub the next morning to get it out) and the metal they play is WAY too loud.  It was so incredibly difficult just to have a conversation.

First, to explain the smoke thing - the kitchen is not closed off at all and doesn't seem to have any venting. Or if it does, it's comically ineffective. And they're cooking burgers constantly. So all that smoke just comes into the restaurant. I am sensitive to smoke, but not overly sensitive, there's just a lot of smoke and a lack of ventilation.  Getting a table: We came late in the afternoon, middle of the week, hoping to avoid crowds and only had to wait about 15 minutes, which still surprised us but I hadn't read anything about it before going so I think we actually did pretty well.  Food: Generally great. Oh, except for the french fries - I understood that I would be getting the waffle fries that were on the menu but instead got some dry stale french fries that were not waffle - evidently this is what they are serving instead of waffle fries nowadays. These are just gross and a waste of your time to eat because they taste like cardboard. My burger, however, was brilliant. It was on rye with gouda and bacon and was really spectacular. The half I couldn't finish was also great when I had it later that night.  Environment: I really liked the space and the people and how despite being busy, there really wasn't a rushed attitude at all. The music was too loud for the middle of the day, especially given that it's pretty heavy, and we had temporary hearing damage like you get from a concert when we left, which was just totally unnecessary.

For future reference for any vegans out there, at the bottom of their menu they state that no items on the menu are vegan.  So that solves that!   My favorite thing about Kuma's is the environment.  Sexy rock people staff the place and are fun to look at.  Metal is underrated and fun to listen to in a drinking context.  It's been so long since high school I had nearly forgotten.  I would come back here purely to drink in the future!

Their homemade ketchup is amazing! It seems to have hot peppers or something in it, whatever it is, its great!  I'm a 110LB girl and I finish my entire 10oz Kuma's burger every time. Yes, you leave a bit full, but you never leave feeling disgusted you feel satisfied and leave with the pride of victory! For fulfilling your stomach's deepest desires. I'm a crazy cheese lover so the Cult burger is my favorite, naturally. It is loaded with something like 5 different types of gourmet CHEESE!!!! God, writing this review is making me want to cruise over and get a burger right now!  Lastly, I just wanna give some credit to the hard working, honorable chefs at Kuma's Corner. I don't know if any of you have noticed that tiny squared off area next to the bar....thats the kitchen. It is literally a 6'X6' kitchen!!! Those men work some magic in that kitchen and I have no clue how they do it!

2011-08-12,3.0,"Went here with a friend because it was one of those places that seemed to be loved by many in Chicago, including food network chefs. We went on a Tuesday at noon to beat the rush. The outside is a little run down, but we didn't have high expectations for exterior and interior aesthetics anyways. However, when you do go to a restaurant, the least even a run-down place could do is have someone greet you fairly fast. The hostess was very slow and apathetic towards us and gave us an estimate of 20 minutes. On a positive note, we were seated within ten minutes and didn't have to endure the usual lines this place gets. The inside is very dark and is decorated with art and speakers played different metal songs. The atmosphere is definitely one that is much more causal, I wouldn't recommend going here with your family or on a date. We ordered fairly fast but the wait for our burgers was over half an hour, which I thought was a little ridiculous since the restaurant wasn't even that big. Our waitress was not very friendly and didn't talk to us until she gave us our burgers and continued to ignore us when we tried to get her attention to bring some ketchup. I ordered the Led Zeppelin and my friend ordered the High on Fire. I greatly enjoyed my burger and I thought that the pulled pork gave it extra moisture and overall it was quite delicious. My friend thought her burger was alright except that all the toppings were centralized so the edges of the burger were mostly bland. The fries were just meh, not enough potato it just seemed liked fried potato skins. We both managed to finish our burgers, but they were of gigantic proportions so we definitely ended up full. All in all, I'd say the burgers were good, but for what this place is worth, it's not worth going out of one's way to pay for an expensive burger only to eat in a smoky, crowded area with mediocre service.",0.9892,0.798,0.145,0.057,0.49707786365681106

2011-08-10,2.0,"I have heard so many ah-mazing things about this joint that I put it on my ""must try"" list. I went in with minimal expectations and left disappointed. We went on a Sunday evening towards the end of the dinner rush hour, or so we thought. I was flabbergasted when the hostess could not give me a wait time over the phone because the wait time fluctuates-- well, duh! Alas, my dining partner and I decided to give it a shot. We found parking right away, which gave us a false sense of hope that the wait wouldn't be long. We couldn't be more wrong. We were told 45 minutes to an hour and waited nearly two hours to be seated at a first available table. We might have been at fault slightly because we didn't know bar seating was first come first serve, but I couldn't risk fighting one of the big biker dudes just to sit on a bar stool.  After waiting two hours in a crowded, non-air conditioned space listening to deafening heavy metal grunge music, we were FINALLY seated. We ordered the calamari for an appetizer and the portion was enormous! We didn't take too long to order, and the waitress was super accommodating when I decided to change my order. I ordered the Metallica and my pal ordered the Lair of the Minotaur. Neither of us could finish our burger because they were massive.  Overall, we waited for two hours for a burger. Really, that's all it is, a burger. It is not some fancy grass-fed organic beef or Kobe beef, just plain old burger beef. My burger was not amazing, spectacular, or out of this world. It was decent, but not worth waiting for two hours. Besides, there wasn't even a dessert menu! No true restaurant does not have a dessert menu!",0.6522,0.88,0.066,0.055,0.511904761904762

2011-08-08,3.0,"Ive been here numerous times so finally, i figured it was about time to write a review. so here goes: 1. THE FOOD Great, food. the burgers are huge and generally they get it about right whether u order well done, medium, etc what have u. The burger patties are wedged between a thick, pretzel roll. Pluses/minues of this include: (+) great chew, holds together very well under super juicy meat/toppings (+) very filling, soft, moist (- )good at first, gets to be a bit too heavy halfway thru the burger as i find myself picking it apart to get at the meat (- )something about it just does not digest well. hours after eating im left with this congested, heavy feeling that leaves me with a bloated burger hangover the next morning The Judas priest is my fav! blue cheese with cranberry chutney? amazing!  the various bevy of others Ive had were good as well...but the thing i've noticed is that the menu (with overly descriptive outlines) makes the burgers seem 100x more complex n succulent than they come out to be.  Plenty of times I found myself staring at my burger n poking around at it n wondering if I had received the right burger why it looks so much simpler than the menu made it out to be. And besides a few that ive had (including the slayer) all the burgers have an eerily similar taste lol. Now, the mac n cheeses are also worth mentioning. $12 gets you a huge portion size that weighs about 5lbs. again, heres another twist though. the first few bites are fantastic- SUPER rich, cheesy flavorx100, but it comes at a cost as you cannot get past a few large tastings before your either full or sick of the full fat taste.  but overall, the burgers are huge, mac n cheeses are fantastic, new fries suck.  2. THE PLACE(factors besides food) COMPLETE opposite end of the rankings spectrum as this place sucks. I get the whole unique, heavy metal rock bar vibe but these guys take it wayyy too far.  The music is obnoxious, they only play the most bizarre independent films. last time i was there i had to sit and watch some weird japanime film that involved an octupus raping some school girl then going on a murder rampage. ya. wtf.  Then they have this stupid list of ""DONTS"" etc etc  Also, last time i was there i ordered a burger, n minutes later decided I wanted a mac n cheese as well. the server immediately snapped ""NO, no takeout"" when i replied i wanted it for there, she insisted that I ""better eat it there"" bc i was already told about the takeout situation.  I mean, cmon guys i know your trying to hold a unique image but....GET OVER YOURSELVES. seriously. quit being such A-holes, nobody cares how different and cool you think you are...most of us are just there for the burgers.

I sent the data to NASA, and they said they'd try to calculate the results before it reaches 4,000. Ok, so despite having the same downside of Hot Doug's of nasty lines, this place is definitely worth the wait. I had the Megadeth and it was delicious. One of my friends ordered the Slayer, and it will haunt his dreams for the next year. I can't imagine anyone finishing it in one sitting (and not hate themselves).

2011-08-02,5.0,"I decided to hit this place for a 2nd time on a recent business trip.  The first visit was quite spectacular -- however, I went in all gung-ho (due to excitement fostered by episode of Food Network DDD) and promptly made a glutton of myself with the ""appetizer"" of pulled pork fries washed down with a few ginger ales. That left me painfully unable to enjoy the huge burger that followed.  This trip allowed me to enter with eyes now wide open. And, more importantly, with a pair of buddies in tow to keep me in check. Based on recommendation, we choose to share a mac and cheese appetizer. Three guys (two of whom can pack it away and weigh in excess of two bills plus change) could hardly put a dent into it.  This was not due to lack of effort, as it was phenomenal, but more due to portion size and the group's collective will-power to not satiate our appetite before the burgers came. And we were all glad we did... The burgers were even better than advertised on DDD and definitely lived up to the descriptions on the menu. The meat was cooked to perfection (medium rare to medium), the toppings were fresh and the pretzel bun takes it over the top. The only issue is that you either need to dislocate your jaw like a snake to get a bite or simply smash the burger down. My fear is the smashing process may remove some of the sensuous juiciness.  I believe they have desserts if you are so inclined. I suspect they are delicious. The full bar and selection of craft beers makes it easy to linger for a bit, although I suspect it would mean you'll receive leering looks from the long line of patrons waiting for their plate of pleasure.

Once I even arrived at 5:00pm on a weeknight and the line was already out the door. Apparently their only ""slow"" time is around 2:00pm--3:00pm on weekdays when you might be lucky and be seated within an hour.  I'd never thought I'd ever say this about a restaurant but Kuma - please raise your prices!!! The food is so, so good that it is definitely worth paying more for and I think if they doubled the prices that might be the only way to be able to not have to wait so dang long for a table. Before eating at Kuma's I had heard they had the reputation as having the best burgs in Chicago and I was very skeptical, I mean c'mon, a burg is a burg. Boy was I wrong. Kuma's burgers are MUCH better than any other burgers I have had before, MUCH MUCH MUCH better! Very fun, creative menu too and tasty sides (especially the waffle cheese fries with BBQ pork). Mmmm, I am starting to salivate as I write this. Kuma's also has an amazing beer list with tons of good and uncommon craft and microbrews on tap.  If Yelp had a six star rating I would give Kuma's Corner a six star rating for the food, but alas, the frustration over insane wait time to be seated necessitates me to proffer a four star overall rating.

You can order a burger named after your favorite bands, like Slayer or Iron Maiden. The staff all look the part of urban hipster toughs, but I noticed no bad attitude (bad for tips). Seating inside is super loud, like a dance club after midnight; I'd recommend the patio. Outside seating feels more like a beer garden and is perfect when the weather is nice. You can still hear the music but you can also tune it out and hear your friends. The burgers--are good! Really, they're good. They're also big and some are down right interesting. Check out their menu online. The real stand-out is the pretzel bun. Every burger place should offer them. I eat a lot of ""fancy"" burgers in CA and every one of them ends up with a soggy bun. The goodness leaks out of the spinach, the meat, or whatever, and drenches the bun. Not so with a pretzel bun. It's the consistency of a soft pretzel with the polished brown crust. It may not sound good, but they don't get soggy and the consistency and flavor is fantastic.  The beer selection is also notably good, again, the menu.

I shared the Pantera and the High on Fire Burger.  Pantera had roasted poblano peppers, bacon, cheddar and monterey jack, house made ranchero sauce, and tortilla strips.  The tortilla strips added great texture to the multiple flavors of the burger, bacon, peppers and cheeses.  I preferred the High on Fire Burger though.  Why?  I tend to like spicy foods and this burger had a subtle hint of siracha hot sauce.  It's got the sauce, proscuitto, grilled pineapple, and sweet chili paste - just the right combination of the S trifecta: savory, sweet, and spicy.  Both burgers were cooked just right...really juicy and served on a pretzel roll.  The roll is probably one of the reasons why I like this place so much - the bread is soft but doesn't get soggy..and it's tough enough to hold without crumbling apart.  After 45 minutes, I demolished the burger, the fries (which were also great) and a few drinks.  Probably won't need to eat for another 24 hrs but it was well worth it. The dining area is a little smokey but bearable.  If the weather is good, try to get a spot in the outdoor patio.  There's a great selection of beers too.  Don't be afraid to eat half your burger and take the rest home.  I saw plenty of patrons take some food to go.  My friend and I were able to finish everything though.  Yah you heard me.. we finished all the fries and burger.. don't wimp out :) Definitely coming back and trying more stuff.  But like the rest of the reviews here, come here for the food and company.  The service was good too despite the wait, but I'm willing to work a bit for my food.",0.9892,0.86,0.119,0.021,0.5481473214285715

YOB burger w/ fries - it has bacon, gouda, roasted red pepper, and a garlic mayo.  Sounds fantastic.  Ordered medium and it came out perfectly cooked.  My one probelm it was sooo damn sloppy, red pepper and tomatoe kept slipping out.  I had to literally pick it up and reassemble at least 4 times.  The burger was HUGE and  juicy (totally a good thing) but grease was dripping everywhere.  Good thing roomie got the invite instead of any fine females, not like it would matter much but you know what I mean.   The bun was good not the best for soaking up the juice/grease.  And the fries were just average.   Yeah there's a 2 hour wait during dinner weekdays and you get to enjoy the awesome selection of beer, very smoky eatery, and listen to some good death metal.  In all honesty my burger had the right concept, wrong outcome.",0.9909,0.647,0.259,0.094,0.5610569985569985

Here goes 1 of the 2-thousand reviews: SEATING - We got to the restaurant around 10:15PM on a Sunday (during the 4th of July weekend) and the hostess told us that it was very unlikely we'd be able to find a table since the kitchen was closing in 30 minutes and there were a handful of people waiting to be seated in the PACKED restaurant. LUCKILY, some spots opened up at the bar and we pounced on those chairs like ""The Flash"".  SERVICE - Our bartenders/servers Pauline and Vivian were off the hook.  They served us like we owned the spot. That's how great they were!  FOOD - We ordered: The BBQ pork sliders - Possiibly the best pork bbq sliders i've had.  Meat was tender and was perfectly pulling apart with every CHOMP.  10/10! The Famous Kuma burger - Coming from LA, i've had great burgers like Father's Office, 50/50 and 25 degrees... so I'm kind of a burger snob. I gotta say that this burger was quite salty with the bacon.  Although a gentleman we spoke to (before we got seated) indicated he was a frequent customer here...and he ordered this burger ALL THE TIME, i would probably try something else the next time i'm here.    The Plague Bringer burger. - My gf is a pescatarian so she ordered this burger with the veggie patty.

All ingredients were fresh and a good amount. Staff was very nice, food runner even brought extra fries without asking as she didn't think were had enough. Also, love the fries as they are the hand cut fries.  Pros: easy to get to. Good beer selection. Jalapeno poppers Great burgers and fries. Loud music. outside seating. Nice staff. Street parking.

I got super lucky with the first spot right in front and as I was getting out of my car, a dude rolled up on the sidewalk on his huge Harley and just parked it there. So gangster----er I mean metal.  We got super lucky that we went on a chilly evening so no one was on the patio apparently...we had NO WAIT for the patio. Yep, you read it right. No wait at Kuma's on a June Saturday night. Bow down to me. Well, I was super cold through the whole meal and sad I didn't get to take in the full ambiance sitting inside so will definitely sit inside on my next trip. The service was amazing. Super friendly and she pretended like she didn't hear me saying how metal I was in my super metal voice.  We started with the mac & cheese. Let me emphasize how big & awesome this is. Three of us split this appetizer at Kuma's, two of us split in half the remaining mac & cheese to take home, and out of those leftovers I got a dinner and a lunch. So much food!!! It was super tasty, too. We put mushrooms & chicken in ours which made it that much more amazing (I could have done with bacon in it but I let a friend pick the ingredients). Seriously for the amount of food & deliciousness you get in $12, I wouldn't pass this up. Pulled pork fries...the fries themselves were not super amazing. They were not the waffle cut fries!

The other reason I will never forget my experience is the Kuma's atmosphere.  Completely worth the wait, the tiny kitchen's limitations, etc.  I'm not too big into heavy metal but I wouldn't want to hear anything else at Kuma's.  It's a surreal experience, and completely makes it memorable.  Places like this will never go out of business... you cannot recreate this anywhere else.  Kuma's is unforgettable!",0.9893,0.785,0.16,0.054,0.5392831541218638

That being said, I don't let the fact that Kuma's is constantly crowded and busy detract from my rating of the restaurant. There's a reason they're busy. If you're not into waiting long, go late at night, after a big storm, or shut up. I show up and if I'm not willing to wait, I'll leave. And try, try again. That being said, last night was my 30th or so time at Kuma's. I'm working on shaking off my winter weight, so after three weeks of an incredibly dedicated rabbit-like diet, I decided I need to spoil myself a bit before I went nuts and ate off my own arm. I had been daydreaming about Kuma's and boy, did we pick the right night. (I have a few friends who work there, so I'm always on the look out for the ""Place is dead! Come eat!"" facebook updates). It was shortly after the storm and for the first time in years, we walked in and got a table within mere seconds. Our waitress was quick and friendly. I had an Allagash White in my hand without seconds (thanks for having it constantly on tap, or so it seems) and a glass of water. Five minutes later, my heaven of heavens were on the table before us: their jalapeno poppers. Cream cheese and chorizo, stuffed into jalapenos, breaded and fried, with this amazingly sweet and spicy raspberry sauce on the side. They are literally my favorite thing to stuff into my face. My boyfriend wasn't interested (or worried I was going to stab him with a fork) and the roommate and her man were saving room for the BBQ pork fries (also amazing) which followed a few minutes later.  We DESTROYED our appetizers. It was a massacre. Needless to say, when burger time finally arrived, I barely had room for about a quarter of my burger. I appreciate the vastness of their menu, but I get the Pantera every time, and am hardly ever disappointed. The Hatebeak to my left was tasty, and the burgers on the other side of the table were delicious as well. My only advice with Kuma's is to go at an off time for your first experience or if you're incredibly hungry/ridiculously impatient.

If she worked for me, she'd be fired five times already. I really don't like the fact that they cannot seat more than four people at a table if you're sitting outside in the patio area. You can't even borrow a chair from the adjacent table with a party of two. Well, in that case, they need to start seating parties of two together at the same darn table designed for a party of four, so they can accommodate more people at the same time. When the patio is open for seating, they don't take carry-out orders. I don't see the logic in that. Oh and heads up, while they do accept credit cards, be sure to bring some cash along if you're not on a date or not extremely close friends with your 'buddies' because they don't do separate checks.

2011-06-19,5.0,"Aw, Kuma's Corner, where do I begin. When I first heard of this marvelous place, I immediately loved the idea from the onset; a small little dive off Belmont that not only serves the most delicious burgers, but also does so within an atmosphere engorged and reverberating with the spirit of heavy metal.  Upon my arrival and the opening of the door, I was bombarded with not just the thrashing, beautiful, and familiar sounds of bands such as Metallica, Sleep, and Mastodon blaring from the speakers, but also with the pervading aroma of hamburgers, fries, and draft beer.   Alas, I digress and should should focus on the facets of the restaurant it self.  The whole restaurant, situated beautifully in the corner of the adjacent building, is quite small and cozy, showcased by a kitchen that is only 16'x6'.  While this does have benefit of not being too crowded with people and of keeping the music evenly contained and audible, it does create a substantially long wait for the hordes of starving patrons just yearning for that Kuma's Corner taste.  Although I was lucky enough to only have a 20 minute wait, other people's experiences seem to span the 1 hour-2 hour mark, though after my first experience, I would gladly brave that long wait for another meal. Now, for food, Kuma's big, well-deserved draw is its specialized and unique burgers, each named after bands that would be both familiar and esoteric to the casual metalhead.  Each burger is served with fries, and contained within pretzel bread buns, a major turn-on and factor into the wondrous taste.  I personally went with the Pantera, a perfectly-balanced choice containing ranchero sauce, cheddar and monterey jack cheese, thick bacon, poblano peppers, and tortilla strips.  This whopper of a burger, along with the accompanying fries, was certainly a filling and perfectly portioned meal that kept my stomach occupied for the rest of the day.  Also, for those of you old and mature enough for the helpings at Kuma's bar, I can assuredly claim that the availability and variety of beers on draft is mind-boggling and a temptation to even the least adventurous drinker.  Jesus, they even have Jack Daniel's on tap! All in all, my entire stay at Kuma's was perfect and fit every one of my lofty expectations I had created, based on its reputation.  I can, with all honesty and no exaggeration, claim that the Pantera was the best burger I have ever had the joy to experience and digest.  Now, to those who may seem a little skeptical of this grandiose claim, there's only one way for you to find out for yourself: hop on down to Kuma's Corner and grab a little bite of heavy metal heaven for yourself. \m/ \m/ Up the irons",0.9976,0.799,0.173,0.028,0.6086920024420025

I saw Kuma's on Travel Channel years ago, and wanted to try it based on the burgers being named on metal bands alone (in addition to being funny, i'm also a big metal fan). A few of my friends had visited Kuma's and teased me with pictures, so on this, my first trip to Chicago, I had to check it out. We went on a Friday afternoon around 3. The hostess told us it would be a 1.5 hour wait...and we had a table 10 minutes later. The atmosphere of Kuma's is cozy dive bar. Being a fan of dive bars, I felt right at home. I loved all of the albums behind the bar, and especially the 3D Jesus picture that I recognized from the movie ""Born in East LA"", lol. I also loved the music playing in the bar. I ordered the Black Oak Arkansas. I was surprised by the flavor of the burger, perfectly seasoned, and cooked perfectly medium--just enough pink in the middle. The fried scallions added a nice bite, and the sauce on the sandwich was amazing. The only thing I would have changed is the side. The fries weren't terrible, they were just, well, fries. I wish they'd offer a smaller side of their macaroni and cheese as a side. Our waitress was adorable, attentive, and extremely friendly. The bathrooms had great graffiti written all over the pin up girl wallpaper. Kuma's serves my second favorite burgers (second only to B Spot in Cleveland).

Nor had the burgers come to the people sitting at the bar near me. Did they have to go butcher the cow?? And when I finally got my burger, it was definitely more of a medium or medium-well than a medium rare.  And though the burger and toppings were flavorful (I did the Kuma burger), I got one bite that was like a mouthful of salt. If there had been paper napkins, I would have spit it out. I've heard good things about their waffle fries, but apparently they don't make them anymore. So I got the hand cut fries instead. I think they have their oil temperature set too high, because the fries are definitely on the dark side, and a little tough/soggy.

Kuma's is tiny, so if you go with more than 4 people you're going to be sitting at separate tables.  Kuma's is loud, the music is metal, and as their rules state, they will not ""put on the game, Bro.""  It is for all these reasons that I love it so hard.  (Note: It's loud, but it gets waaaay louder after 10.) They have a great beer selection as well as a full bar (Allagash White, hello my friend.)  Their burgers and sandwiches are so damn big and stuffed with amazing things, I always end up taking some home, especially if my friends insist on the BBQ pork fries appetizer, which they always do.  Man, I don't even LIKE pork and these things are killer. Service is solid, there is parking nearby, and the food is AMAZING.  Their pretzel rolls are so good they damn near bring me to tears.  I don't need to recite for you the menu, but my favorites are the YOB (burger with gouda, roasted red peppers, garlic mayo and bacon) and the tongue-torching Plague Bringer with chicken breast (which you can sub, along with a veggie burger or chicken fingers, instead of your beef patty.)

2011-06-07,5.0,"I have been hearing about this place from a lot of family and friends for quite some time and for as much as we dine out, I'm ashamed to say it took me so long to go, but so happy to have had the opportunity to go here for dinner a few nights ago. It was such an experience. I texted my buddy on Sunday afternoon and asked if he had an interest in grabbing dinner with his fiance and my boyfriend later on but I wanted to try something new. Took him all of 2 seconds to think of Kuma's...a place he frequents and knows we have never been.  We drove out to the city, where typically I hate city parking, but were able to get a pretty close spot. People are in and out of here quickly. They have to be because it's so busy all the time from what I hear and what I saw. Feed 'em and turn that table over for the next party. (which is exactly what I did when we were done eating....pay the bill and hit the bricks! I just felt bad for all the people waiting to eat) The 4 of us went in and were greeted by the hostess who took our name, provided us a drink menu (which I should probably call the ""Beer Menu"" because it's a LOT of beer options) and told us our wait would be about 30-45 mins...not terrible for 7PM on a Sunday night in a PACKED restaurant.  I understand they are usually pretty busy most hours of the day, so be prepared to wait if you are visiting anytime soon. Their patio is open for summer -weather permitting- and they have a lovely message up on their chalkboard stating that ""TO-GO orders are over, just like the Cubs season"". As a lifetime Cubbie fan, I was insulted for about a millisecond before I admitted they are correct on this one. We ordered some drinks at the bar. Myself and my buddy's fiance both ordered Cream Soda, a favorite of mine from childhood, and he got some off the wall beer with pink elephants on it. The cream soda is a brand I have seen at Whole Foods and is really best served with a glass of ice and it was! We rested our butts on the narrow windowsill next to the bar, people-watched and waited to be called for dinner. Yes, we people-watched. This place has everything from Mom & Dad with the kids, bikers, ""mature"" adults, preppy college kids, lovely ladies (such as myself) and your average everyday Joe.  We were greeted by ""Humper"" (according to the receipt) who had a great personality and really made us feel at home and welcome. We never felt rushed and she was very attentive but not overly at the table.  Two people in our party ordered the Mastodon, I got the Zepplin burger and my buddy got the Plague Bringer. We heard they use to serve waffle fries which are no longer in existence here. But the fresh cut fries they served were delicious and actually fresh! Way to go, Kuma's! They are a little on the pricey side for a burger joint but you are paying for a quality meal, large portions (therefore: leftovers!) and a whole unique dining experience. Good tip: They won't split the bill amongst multiple credit cards, but will accept cash for part of the bill and a credit card for the balance. If you are anything like us and our friends, we never carry cash, so this is important to know.  They are known for their Kuma burger that is served with Bacon, Cheddar, and a Fried Egg and I heard from a lot of people that this is a killer option. My buddy actually added a fried egg to his Plague Bringer- 2 bucks extra, but from what I understand, totally worth it! Dinner for the 4 of us- about $100 including an app priced the same as all 4 of our meals. I have no problem spending $100 for 4 people to have burgers if we have a fun dining experience with great food, good friends and just a fun atmosphere. Bring the kids on down, jump on your Harley (stop and pick me up on the way), get on the train, grab the next bus...do what you gotta do, just get over here before you waste your money on some crappy burger at your local grill.

Hence, if you want to sit outside, go earlier. But of course you might have to wait longer than we did.  We ordered between 2 of us, the Kuma's burger and the mac and cheese with corn and broccoli.  I love the pretzel burger used, the patty was ok but the sauce was not bad. I didn't like the fries though. However, I saw another table having the chips and they looked really good! Kinda regretted not getting the chips... I thought the mac and cheese was pretty good but the portion was OMG ginormous! We only managed a few bites and that was it! Had to pack that home for sure! But I think eating leftover mac and cheese ain't as yummy as having them on the spot :( So, bottomline is to come here with a big group of friends and order the mac and cheese.

I've tried a handful of their other burgers, all with rock/metal band names. If you want a burger sans egg, I recommend the Slayer. However, Kuma's isn't simply known for their burgers, they also have the best Mac and Cheese I've ever had. It's a build-your-own Mac and Cheese, filling a gigantic bowl (fit for two).

2011-06-04,5.0,"Wow, Kuma's probably doesn't need another 5-star review to enhance their reputation, but I can't help but contribute. Believe the hype folks, the wait time is worth it, as their burgers are truly something to behold.  Now I happen to consider myself a bit of a burger-connoisseur, but I hadn't really had a burger in Chi yet that had taken me to carnivore-heaven, until I had the Black Oak Arkansas at Kuma's.  The burger was huge and easily ranks as one of the best burgers I have ever had the pleasure of devouring.  They have a lot of other creative burger options as well, and judging from the plates at other folk's tables (yeah I was looking) every scrumptious burger concoction I saw come out of the kitchen looked mouthwatering. So burgers get an A+, but you also have to order their mac-n-cheese, which you can customize to your liking.  It's fan-freakin-tastic, especially if you order it with chicken/sun-dried tomoatoes.  Woot. And, as an added bonus for me, they play death-metal, at a reasonably high-level, all the effing time.  It's refreshing to step into a bar/grill and hear heavy music that you would never hear on the radio or in 99.9% of jukeboxes (or whatever they're called these days).  Kuma's keeps it real with the metal, and somewhat surprisingly, it does not turn off the majority of folks from waiting in line for 1-2 hours.  Why?  Oh yeah, that's right, the burgers are flipping amazing!  And, you can indulge in their fine beer selection while you wait, which always helps pass the time. So finally, my dream of heaven on earth has been imagined and realized: all walks of life, under one roof, drinking quality beer, and enjoying mouth-watering burgers with Cannibal Corpse blasting in the background.  They say I'm a dreamer, but apparently, I'm not the only one.",0.9971,0.758,0.22,0.022,0.638095238095238

2011-05-30,4.0,"FINALLY can cross Kuma's off my list of places to try in chicago. Honestly, I don't want to wait 1 hour plus for a burger. That being said, a rainy weekday supported the opportunity.  The spot is not what you'd expect. The heavily tattooed wait staff already sets a cool punk style to the place, which is ironic since the patrons were mostly wrigleyville yuppies. All in all, everyone was nice, knowledgable and keep things moving. A suggestion... try to sit at the bar. It is first come first served (which may cause some confrontations). We waited about an hour (at a bar across the street) then slid into a bar spot immediately.  Premium beer selections have become more and more popular in the Chicagoland area, and Kuma's is no exception. I'd say premium beer is a must with premium burgers, but light lime won't do the trick.  Iron Maiden was my burger of choice, and while it was good, lacked a ""holy &^%&^ this was worth the wait"" element. The key word in the burger description was chipotle mayo.  It was easier to find Osama than the chipotle flavor. The patty was great. HIGH quality beef, cooked to perfection. I almost forgot.. PRETZEL buns. how Genius. Totally eliminates the soggy bun effect. The burger held itself together like a champ. My friend had the slayer. and with just one bite it was the clear winner in taste. I can't elaborate anymore on it, but it was full of flavor as opposed to iron maiden.

After I arrived at the restaurant, there was a line out of the door.    Fortunately, since I was by myself, there was one open space at the bar, so I was seated immediately. Before I went, I had read about this place on this site, so I wanted to add my thoughts.   Below are the good things and bad things about this place: The good 1)   The hostess and my bartender/waitress were super cool.   Although it was very loud in this place because of the blaring heavy metal music, the hostess was cool enough to give me directions to get back to public transportation.    2)   The toppings on the hamburger were exceptional.    I ordered the Plague Bringer, and it was loaded with pepper jack cheese, jalapenos, tomatoes, tortilla strips and a flavorful mayo.  Yum! The bad 1)   It took awhile for me to get my hamburger.   I waited at least 40 minutes after the time I placed my order, but, fortunately, if you like to people watch ( I do), the time goes by pretty fast.  All types of people come here, from Lincoln Park yuppies to people with tats all over their bodies, so that was cool. 2)  This place is too loud.   I could barely hear the bartender when she was talking to me.   Perhaps I am getting too old, but I don't see how you could hold a decent conversation here. 3)   The quality of the beef was decent, but not the best I've ever had.

Parking was a little hassle but what are you going to do this is Chicago if you don't like it move or buy a bicycle. So anyhooters I noticed when we drove by the place at 12:10pm that there were already people waiting outside.

So that meant no wait for me. I am definately NOT a girl who waits in lines ANYWHERE. When we sat down our waitress was a little iffy.. She had a packed bar and we weren't ordering drinks- so coming from a former bartender I would be pissed too at two people just ordering a burger, but whatever isn't tht why everyone comes here for?! Besides our waitress who in sure meant well- the food was awesome. I got the lair of Minotaur and my grind got the slayer- thinking it was a burger but really came out as a buyer deconstructed. This meaning, it was a pile of fries, chili, jalepenos, burger meat, and a bunch of cheese on top of a huge ass plate. My frien was expecting a burger but he's known to always screw up his order. My burger was medium well, and had just the right amount of Brie and just the right amount of onions and poached pear on top if it. It was also served with a generous amount of French fries. Clearly my eyes were bigger than my appitite and I ended up taking three bites and saving my leftovers. My friend ended up taking his home and eating it over the next two days!

I got the Mastodon burger, which I'm sure is good when it isn't half raw.  I like medium rare as much as the next girl, but this was cold.  I lost my appetite.   If you want a good burger, there are a million other places to go that don't require you to be uncomfortable.  Avoid Kuma's if you're squeamish.",-0.7636,0.822,0.068,0.11,0.5106718898385565
2011-05-19,3.0,"Tried to come here once last summer and was told there would be a two hour wait - that didn't sit well with our hangovers so we skeedaddled over to Goose Island instead to feed our alcohol-laden hunger. I swore I'd be back one day. Last night just happened to be that day - impromptu date night and a craving for a hamburger after three weeks on Jenny Craig led me and the man to Kumas. We called ahead, curious about the wait, and was told we couldn't be quoted a time over the phone but that it wasn't too crazy in there. We decided to take the risk and make the drive out there and were delighted when we were only told we had to wait 45 minutes (a reasonable request given Kuma's reputation). However, a couple got up from the bar right as we were arriving so we took their seats and were greeted by the friendly, adorable bartender right away. Service, decor, and great beer selection aside - the food is just, unfortunately, decent. They have HUGE burgers, I'll give them that. The menu is diverse and eclectic but I feel that the flavors fail to deliver. Granted my date's Plague Burner was SPICY and intense. KC does NOT fuck around with their homemade spicy sauce. But my Black Oak Arkansas was just blah. The BBQ sauce tasted more like tangy tomato sauce and the bacon, while thick, just didn't do it for me. I even cut a piece  of the burger off the side to taste just the meat and though I was pleased with the thick, juicy patty, I didn't think it was anything I couldn't do at home.  Also, my fries with bland, lukewarm, and stale. I think I should have gotten the chips. Will I go back? Sure. Will I wait over 45 minutes, EVER? No. Will I try their mac n' cheese next time?

We sat at the bar in the corner where there is less foot traffic. The beers were palatable, and the burgers were fairly juicy. The Goat Whore seriously hurt my tongue with its tart and salt, but I ate it anyway because it tasted good. My friends got the Slayer (so massive its sick), the Yob, Iron Maiden, and Neurosis. Nobody had any major complaints about the burgers except that they were overcooked.  The loss of waffle fries from the meal WAS something to be mourned. Stick fries are pretty sad comparatively and don't transport nearly enough ketchup. My eyes get dreamy whenever I hear that a place serves waffle fries and that was one of the selling points of another visit to Kuma's for me. The bad part was that when I asked about what happened with the waffle fries, the waitress copped a huge attitude about customers being big babies about change and basically ignored us for the rest of the time we were there. We kept having to flag down the bar tender and ask him to ask her for basic stuff, like condiments and more water. Then my friend accidentally tipped over an almost empty glass and she came over with a bar rag and just slammed it down to mop up the water. It was about then when we decided to bail instead of continuing to drink after our meal. I keep really wanting to like this place like everyone else does. It has some serious potential.

2011-04-29,2.0,"Kuma's is off their game. Either the swarm of Trixies and Chads has broken their spirit, or they're trying to make their costs cheaper. Either way, they're seriously cutting corners now, and the Food Network ruination of Kuma's is now complete. I've tried every burger on the menu, and several that have gone by the wayside. I know what a ""Goblin Cock"" is, and ""insect Warfare"" should have stuck around forever. Kuma's was my go-to place to take people when they came to visit me in Chicago. I converted two vegetarians with their food. It was magical. Then I left town for two weeks... I went to Kuma's. We were a party of 3 and all starving. We ordered the pork fries, and I ordered a Slayer. The pork fries came out, and I was the first to notice. ""What the fuck happened to the waffle fries?"" I said candidly to my dining companions. The new fries are awful. They're soggy, under-seasoned (Maybe even unsalted?), and under-fried. I remember Kuma's before they had waffle fries to begin with. These fries are on-par with the terrible ones they originally replaced all those years ago. They suck. Badly. And I ordered a Slayer... A burger served on a bed of fries. Wonderful. The other two people at my table got their food. They told me mine would be right out. 5-10 minutes later, they brought me what appeared to be a Slayer. They also brought out some hot sauce, salt, and pepper... Which I noted and thought ""Who would use salt and pepper on a perfectly-seasoned Kuma burger?"" Then I started eating and I saw the most egregious violation of everything I know and love about Kuma's. They changed their meat. Over the years, I've seen their patties go from wide and short to narrow and tall and every iteration in between. I've seen them go from perfectly seasoned to ""a little too salty"" on the rare occasion a new chef is being a bit heavy-handed with the salt. What I got this day was an absolute travesty. It was over-worked, unseasoned, gritty, dry shit. It wasn't a kuma burger. It tasted like they had gone to the grocery store and bought some ground round, then put the thing through a food processor to make sure it was extra-gritty, then it was grilled and buried in my sorry excuse for a Slayer. I can't finish a Slayer in one sitting. No reasonable human should be able to. I killed this one off in one sitting because the volume just wasn't there without the waffle fries. I used to think that there was one restaurant in the city that wouldn't sell out... Wouldn't stray from its outright creativity and ability to consistently produce fantastic food. That restaurant was Kuma's. I'll give them a month or so, then I'll go back. I hope they're experimenting with something that they're going to realize is turning their customers away... If they even care. There's always another sucker who sees them on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives who will be more than willing to pay $15 for a burger that pales in comparison to what they were serving less than a month ago.",-0.9591,0.83,0.066,0.104,0.545925729599199

This time we got here before the lunch crowd as they opened.  This was my husbo's first time, and we ordered beers before perusing the choices.  Which grew a lot since my visit it seems.  Excited, I ordered the Lair of the Minotaur, MR and he the Led Zeppelin, R   Mouths watering, we waited patiently as the place filled beyond capacity with fellow hungry burger lovers.   Finally, they came.  I salivated. I bit.  Hmmm.  What's this? Well done meat? Bite again.   Yeah, well done.  No pink, much less red.  No juice.  Just crumbling, dry meat destroying that yummy brie and pears.  Is there Pancetta on here?  I can't tell, I'm too preoccupied with the horrible beef on this bun.  This was not a minor mistake in temp.  It was major and inexcusable. What a disappointing visit.  Luckily the hubs' burger was a little less done, and still pink.  But he shrugged and said out of five stars he'd give it 3, maybe 3.5, if only for the toppings.  My husband is a generous man.   Did Kuma's get too big for it's britches?  I think it might have.  It's definitely jumped the shark as far as I'm concerned.  There are way better burgers in this city. For the record, our server apologized for the mass of overcooked grossness but then chastized me a bit for not mentioning it sooner.  She's right, I should have.  But seeing the mass of people that had shown up, I was concerned about how long that would actually take.  Besides--if your joint prides itself on its burgers and serves more than a page-full of burger varieties, the least you can do is cook the damn thing properly.  I should not HAVE to send this back.  I still paid a full $13 for the two bites I ate of my burger.  At least the fries were good and I can still appreciate the beer and music selection.   I heard similar complaints from others, so my words to the wise would be to cut your burger in half as soon as you get it. You shouldn't have to do that at a place with this reputation, but you do.   Bummer.  This was definitely a ""Meh"" 2 star visit.  I'll leave this place to the tourists from now on.",0.9683,0.834,0.111,0.055,0.47912513842746396

2011-04-26,5.0,"Let me start off by saying that this is probably my favorite restaurant in Chicago!  I've been here 20+ times and it never gets old.  It's kind of a gluttonous treat that I indulge in once a month or so. I'll get to the food later, but let's start with the atmosphere.  Kuma's is a small restaurant that seats around 40 people if you include the seats at the bar (60ish during the summer when they open up the patio).  They play nothing but metal and specifically state that they will not put on the game.   The walls are covered with random memorabilia as well as some conversation-piece paintings of half naked bloody women. On to the food.  Hands down, these are the best burgers in Chicago!  They're on a whole different level than those at other burger spots.  The meat has unbelievable flavor and is good enough to be eaten medium-rare.  Well-done is a sin in my personal opinion.  The pretzel buns are baked by Labriola Bakery and really stand on their own in flavor and stand up to the weight of the 10 oz. burgers and all of their toppings. The creative and delicious toppings, however, are really what set these burgers apart.  There are too many to name, but some of my favorites include: the newly added Absu with spicy tomatillo salsa, pepperjack, red onion/avocado relish, queso fresco and trio of breaded deep fried chiles; High on Fire with Siracha , prosciutto, roasted red pepper, grilled pineapple and sweet chili paste; and the breath destroying Plague Bringer with roasted garlic mayo, tortilla strips, house made hot sauce, fresh garlic, pepper jack and sliced jalapenos! Complimenting the burgers are appetizers like make your own mac n' cheese, jalapeno poppers with raspberry chipotle sauce and some really good buffalo chicken tenders. Fair warning, be prepared to wait.  The worst I've ever heard them quote is 3 1/2 hours, but usually it is around 1 1/2.  Savvy patrons might be able to scavenge a few seats at the bar to eat at.  You can always keep yourself entertained by their extensive list of craft beers, other delicious brews on tap, amazing bloodys (I don't like them, but I've been told they are the best) and Jack Daniels on tap!

We got our food in about 20-30 min which is ok because their kitchen is tiny as hell (kitchen from hell!!) and there were tons of people so I forgive that. No more waffle fries, only fresh cut fries, and the fries came with some kind of ketchup mix, it had onion and jalapenos in it, interestingly it was pretty good. Fries were good, needed more seasoning for me, I'm a seasone fry freak. My burger was medium well done perfectly and my first bite was scorching hot but delicious. The burger was juicy, spiced good, and I got all the flavor of the red wine barbeque sauce, creamy cheddar cheese, and the smokey bacon. And those wonderfully batter deep fried shallots to top it all of. So crunchy and sweet. I have never had a pretzel bun, and wow,  I loved it! It was fluffy, soft, and filling, it hit the spot w/the burger! My fiancesburger was insanely better than mine I was jealous, although I loved mine too, I dunno, maybe because Im a garlic freak! HIs was spicy and garlicky with the pepperjack cheese and jalapenos. Chips gave it some texture besides the bread.  Best burger I ever had in my life. The place itself is a hole in the wall, with nudie girlie pics on the wall, especially in the bathroow, where although clean, filled with graffiti'd naughty girl pics. No offense, it doesn't bother me, but I'd still rather not see girly pics EVERYWHERE! All the decor was heavy metal themed, and the celing looks like a Hershey Bar.  Heavy metal music, I do not mind, but it was rather on the loud side. My fiance & I were seated towards the back by the exit door & it kept being SLAMMED LOUDLY by people going out to smoke the joint or cigs. Now can we at least close the door gently people!? It kept bringing in a cold draft! I am not  a complainer, but WTF someone was going out to smoke almost every 3 minutes....no joke, I kept track. Thats too much door slamming & cold wind. Waitress took way too long coming by us, maybe we didn't look heavy metal enough for her? I looked more ghetto fabolous then anything, but hey that's not a reason to overlook me because I dont blend in.  Be aware 1 credit card per table no split checks. Not that you'd be able to fit a group of more than 3 people....

I came here with my boyfriend on a Thursday night expecting a pretty long wait after reading reviews on Yelp...we walked into the small, crowded space with major loud metal music and were told that the wait would be an hour for a table of two. We sat at the bar and ordered a round of beers, and 20 minutes later were seated - it seems as though they may overestimate the wait sometimes. I'm sure on the weekends it's a different story, but for a Thursday night at 7 the wait was short and sweet. Awesome decor, super friendly waitstaff. Everyone's covered in tattoos and is very helpful and accommodating. The bathrooms were decent too. The food is amazeballs. Seriously. Best cheeseburger I have ever had. Ever. I ordered the ""Lair of the Minotaur"" - brie, bourbon soaked pear, pancetta and my boyfriend ordered ""Plague Bringer"" - garlic, jalapenos, tortilla strips. But everything on the menu looked so delicious. Yummy fries too! And a great beer selection. I would 100% come here again! Side note: I wouldn't come in here if you're adamantly opposed to metal, meat-eaters or loud music...or if you have sideswept bangs and listen to My Chemical Romance.

(If they quote you 3+ hours, it's probably more like 2 hours) Pulled Pork Fries - Amazing (although now I think pulled pork on anything is good) Interesting concept to use waffle fries instead of normal fries, but they hold together better under the meat. Tasty sauce. Mac and Cheese - Creamy goodness with a good amount of meat. The white cheddar is amazing, and with your choice of two toppings (we chose Prosciutto and Andouille). The serving is quite large, we barely split the plate between two people, it can easily be split between 4. Burgers - My goodness what a burger. Not quite the best I've ever had, but the pretzel bun was out of this world. It really makes the burger in my opinion. Easily a top 5, joining burgers from Cherry Cricket in Denver and Thurman's in Columbus.  The heavy metal atmosphere was truly unique.

This place will always be easily top three burgers I've ever had (Motorhead, Lair of the Minotaur, CHECK 'EM OUT). The variety of burgers they serve is fantastic, the weekly specials are always as good as the menu regulars, and the beer they serve is a great sampling of craft. All their prices are pretty reasonable IMHO as well. The ambience of the place is fun too, love the metal playing and all the decor to go with it. Pretty nice mix of clientele as well, younger business types grabbing lunch mixed with the more hardcore crowd. Now I wish I could give this place four-and-a-half stars, if only for the small size of the joint and the ridiculous wait time (unless you're sly like my wife and I and show up fifteen minutes before the doors open, in which case its a fifteen minute wait, and you get the first round of tables).  Also, don't expect it to be easy for a six-person crew to get a table quickly and easily anytime, the setup is not conducive to large groups. Now don't get me wrong, I do not blame the owners for this. It is not their fault they are super popular because of their awesome joint, and I totally get why they want to keep quality control tight by having this place not grow too fast. But unfortunately, the wait issue can be hampering. Regardless, the servers are usually real friendly, and as long as you're not an ass you will be treated well.

2011-03-29,5.0,"Sure, there are things I don't like about Kuma's, namely that you can almost never ever find a time to eat there when you won't have to wait and they close on random holidays and they mock sports bar culture, but frankly, when you make burgers this good, you can do whatever the heck you want. One of those things would be to establish yourself as a heavy metal bar and hire an exclusively pierced and tattooed wait staff. But even if they played scream-o and everyone had hellraiser make up on and didn't look you in the eye, I'd still come back for the burgers. These mammoth burgers are nearly impossible to eat in one sitting, but they're so good you have trouble not at least trying. They have some simple options like the Kaijo, which I enjoy a lot, but you really have to step out of that burger comfort zone to be amazed by the concoctions. I had the Judas Priest on my last visit, which combines dried cranberries, green apple and blue cheese dressing and yes, it works. My recommendation would be getting there right when they open on a weekday or not during a traditional meal time if you want a chance at getting seated quickly. Also, in the summer they open up the back patio, which helps.",0.9837,0.799,0.162,0.039,0.4362914862914863

2011-03-28,4.0,"Kuma's is great if you know what you're getting. I can see why a few first timers can be put off by Kuma. There's so much selection and while their portions are consistently huge, after being here a couple times I have to say I haven't been wowed by every burger. The loud metal music also won't be everyone's cup of tea, but it adds to the experience. ""Our Famous Kuma Burger"" is still my favorite of them all (bacon, cheddar, fried egg), with an extra fried egg. The extra egg makes a difference. I'm not much for eggs on my burgers but I will here. The YOB (smoked gouda, bacon, roasted red peppers, roasted garlic mayo) is also pretty good. The Lair of the Minotaur and the Earthride were just okay for me. While not all, most of their burgers are named after bands. I take a liking to that concept especially when you try and relate the ingredients in each burger to the band. It's actually a fun conversation piece. And the pretzel buns they use are excellent. I ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS ORDER THE BBQ PORK FRIES. That thing is a mountain of goodness. I also love their mac & cheese. Even bigger points because it's a ""make your own"" deal so you can choose what you like in your mac. I like getting scallions, sun-dried tomato, or bacon. Not necessarily together, though I wonder... Their beer selection is also fantastic. It will often rotate though, with the season. I've heard iffy staff stories from friends or people I know. But from my own observation, I have yet to have a bad service experience at Kuma. They've always been fun and willing to help and suggest things. They also get along well with and support local businesses. I even remember back when Cake Girls next door burned down they had a fundraiser thing going on to help them out, I thought that was really nice. All in all, great food. Great beer. Great service. And you will wait, get over it. I find myself here on a weekday, say a Tuesday. Some people say the afternoon, I actually like going at night, maybe 8-9pm.

Even the bathroom is covered in pin up girls and graffiti and the tattooed staff is just the type of nonconformist people I love to be around.  There is death metal blaring from the speakers and you almost feel that you are out at a bar on a Saturday night . I mean come on this place has Jack Daniels on tap, they are bad ass.   I was having a blast even while waiting for a table.  About 35 minutes later we were sat and  given the extremely hard task of ordering off of a huge beer menu.  I finally decided to go with a porter they have on tap, it had great flavor and a great price to go with it (5.00).  We ordered the jalapeno poppers for an app.  They give you 6 huge peppers stuffed with cream cheese and chorizo with a raspberry jalapeno dipping sauce, they were super yummy (10.00).  As far as the burgers go there are ton of options to choose from and they all come with a Death Metal name!  I ordered the Pantera (13.00)  This burger comes straight from heaven!  It is a 10 oz.  burger with bacon, rachero sauce, pepper jack cheese, and tortilla strips all loaded onto a pretzel bun and served with a side of waffle fries.  It was juicy, perfectly cooked and delicious, the kind of burger that you take a huge bite of and then wipe the juice and grease from your chin and lick your fingers, kind of like falling in love.  Bottom line you have got to try this place, it is packed and for good reason, it definitely lives up to all the hype.  Great food, beer and a very warm welcoming and attentive staff.  I will definitely be willing to put my name on the long wait list again and again!",0.9967,0.793,0.181,0.026,0.7064166666666668

Finally seated, I had to overcome the difficult task of picking a burger.  I wasn't sure if I should start with the Kuma's burger since it was my first time..you know, might want to start slow.. but I decided to branch out.  Embarrassingly enough, I have now forgotten my delicious burger's name...but it had bacon, barbeque sauce, aged cheddar - really tasty.  I couldn't finish the massive meal, but I savored every bite of delicious goodness.  I also had a taste of the burger with pear and brie - good, but a bit sweet for my liking.  The waffle fries are a definite must.  4 for food. The atmosphere was bustling and crowded.  However, I was shocked to learn that I could actually participate in a conversation while seated.  The music was loud, but acoustically, you could still chat at the table without screaming.  I'm not sure how Kuma's manages this as I've been at places with less people and more noise.  The room is very dark and the artwork skews a bit strange (to be nice...).  Everyone in this restaurant seemed ready for a wait and were happy to chat.  4 for atmosphere. Service was a bit on and off.  The hostess was super - I'm not sure how she manages the crowd with a smile and apparently never forgetting who arrived first.  She was really super.  Our waitress was a bit batty.  She was a bit slow in helping us - not sure if this was due to the crowd as there seem to be more than enough servers for the tables.  The check took forever to come out.  Service was a definite 3. Value was pretty good - beer was inexpensive compared to city prices.  The burgers were slightly expensive, but in-line with similar 'gourmet' burgers.  Value is around a 4.

Much like that other Avondale food mecca, Hot Doug's, the key is off hours.  I recommend Tuesday afternoons.  Arrive after lunch, like 2 PM.  Muscle into the bar and order there.  You'll get your burger double quick, and come 3:30 PM, the crowd winds down.  If you escape the oncoming food coma, you'll almost be able to experience Kuma's pre-burger explosion and actually hang out at the bar and drink to your heart's content.  Until the dinner rush, anyway. While I loved the simple bar quality of Kuma's prior to the burger explosion (the food was great even then), I can't fault Kuma's for milking the heavy metal burger menu like Daniel Plainview milks oil wells, or milkshakes, or whatever he does.  The quality of the beef is superb, and the selections merit multiple visits.  I had the Mastodon just this week, and loved the flavor mashup of BBQ Sauce, Cheddar and Bacon.  The Yob, with Smoked Gouda, Bacon, Roasted Red Peppers, and the four cheese Clutch burger, are equally good.  (I prefer to retain a certain traditional effect to my fancy burgers).  Kelly loves the waffle fries, but the homemade kettle chips are pretty damn tasty as well. When I was last there, I discovered that they have Buffalo Trace bourbon on tap.  My, oh my, Kuma's has laid the groundwork for a bourbon monster of which Dr. Frankenstein would be proud.  Barney Gumble may crawl under a Duff tap, but my noble bourbon boozers would much rather crawl under this.  If you can manage to create a suitable diversion, go for it and take pictures. I like to think that I had an influence in the Buffalo Trace tap.  This is not entirely delusional grandeur on my part.  True story -- back in the day, before the burger explosion, I was sitting at the bar, talking with Alex, one of the managers if not the owner, about bourbon.  I had recently discovered Buffalo Trace while at The Driskill Hotel in Austin Texas.  Alex was not familiar with this brand, and I gushed over its quality.  Nearly ten years later, it is on tap.  Coincidence?  I  think not.  But don't argue with me about causation; next time you are at Kuma's, order a pint of Buffalo Trace and drink it down for me.",0.9916,0.835,0.143,0.022,0.4486319966583124

2011-02-22,3.0,"Eating at Kuma's Corner was an interesting experience, I'm not sure whether I would do it again, but I'm certainly glad that I had gone. Ordered: Mac and Cheese, Iron Maiden, High on Fire Arrival time: Saturday 2:30 PM Wait time: 1.5 hr around bar (expected 3.5 hr for table) Summary: mac and cheese was very good, patties weren't done right, but toppings were very good. We went at a really odd time at around 2:30 PM on Saturday, and the place was absolutely packed.  We were told that there would be a wait time of 3.5 hours; but having read so many positive reviews online and on TV, we were determined to wait.  After all, waiting for good food is not a foreign concept: I've done 3 hour waits at 4:30 *AM* As we waited, it became more an more irritating... the room was stiflingly hot, and the heavy-metal music made me more and more angry as I watched other patrons wolfing down their big plates of meat and fries.  Eventually, we decided to go for a seat at the bar instead (shorter wait).  Everybody was vigilant as chairs were hot commodities, and I almost ended up fighting a guy for a seat (which he later rightfully claimed because he  had in fact been standing there much longer than I had)... not something I would have normally done, but stakes were high.  If you are reading this: SORRY DUDE! Mac & Cheese: We finally got a seat after at around 4 PM, and began our special food journey with a plate of Mac and Cheese.  The dish was rather well-done, the andouille sausage bits were tasty and the jalapenos gave it an added kick.  This was a simple and bold dish, and went extremely well with my Milk Stout draft beer. Iron Maiden: Onto the burger, the reason why I came.  The burger was actually extremely disappointing given its hype.  Objectively speaking, it was a decent burger, I would have probably eaten it without much complaint if I ordered it from a random burger joint.  However, having been proclaimed to be ""Chicago's best"" by various people, it did not come close in meeting my expectations.   I ordered a medium, and what came out was at the very least a medium-well, maybe even well; this is not something that can be overlooked.  Much like steak, the temperature also makes a burger.  The entire patty was cooked through, not a hint of pinkness was found, not even at the centre.  The patty was extremely thick, which should be a good thing, given how burgers should be juicy.  The patty turned out to be very dry, which I suspect is due to the line cooks repeatedly pressing the burger with their spatula, an act that I loathe.  Truthfully, the patty was closer to a chunk of meatloaf rather than a burger. The toppings were delicious: avocado and the chipotle mayo sauce worked beautifully together, making the otherwise very dry burger creamy and full of flavours.  The pretzel bun is an ingenious inclusion, as the bun has more structural rigidity, and remains in tact even though the patty is 10 oz.  However, I found the bun to be quite salty, and that distracted the experience somewhat. High On Fire: This burger suffered the same fate as the Iron Maiden.  Again, the toppings were delicious, the combination of grilled pineapple with roasted pepper is heavenly; as an added plus, because this burger was slightly on the sweet side, the added saltiness of the bun actually gave it great balance. In conclusion, Kuma's serves decent burgers with creative and original toppings, but overcooking patties at an established burger joint is an act of sin and should not be excused; for this reason, I sincerely hope there are better burger places in Chicago.  Overall, 1.5 hr wait is more than acceptable if the food is exceptional, but unfortunately, Kuma's was not.  Pearl's in SF is much better and has almost no lines (except maybe at late-nights on weekends); similarly, almost every burger I had in Tokyo surpass Kuma's by miles.",0.9973,0.77,0.158,0.072,0.5758673608673609

And you need only peruse the menu to see this place offers some very interesting burger options. I mean, one of their burgers is topped with chili, andouille and anger. How could this be wrong? It's not wrong. Not exactly. It's just seriously over-hyped. I'm fine with waiting a while for a table and I'm fine with waiting for my food. That's just part of the territory when you go to a small restaurant everyone seems to love. But that's not where I take issue with this place.  The servers are harried but efficient. The metal doesn't make me flinch. The lighting is dim enough that I don't have to worry about the ketchup dripping down my face... So, why did I leave Kuma's thinking, ""Meh. Next time, let's get pizza,"" you ask?  (It's the burgers). Now. Please understand. If I had just been passing down the street and seen this place, walked in and had a bite then I probably would be perfectly satisfied with this place. But that's not what happened.  What happened was every burger lover I've met since I moved to Chicago has served me a hearty portion of ""Oh my gawd, you haven't been to Kuma's yet?! Are you INSANE!!!"" Aforementioned burger lovers, without variation, went on to drool, pass out and moan over these burgers. And so, of course, when I finally stepped through that door I expected I was in for something very special. It was acceptable. It was pretty good, even. But those burger patties... something isn't right about them. They just taste so.... grocery store 80/20 unseasoned ground beef. I'm not saying they are. I'm just saying every great burger I've ever had has been something a little bit more special. And with all those inventive toppings, I just thought they'd be sitting on a patty of unmatched awesome-ness. But, hell. Maybe I'm just picky about my beef.

It's as wide as 3 people standing side-by-side. - Went there at noon on Sunday and the wait was at least 2 hours. - Bar area is first-come-first serve. Honestly, this place is highly overrated.

Nonetheless, the burgers should still be edible enough when cooked this way to have some sort of flavor to it, but it didn't,  and I cannot believe anyone would rate their burgers highly if ordered well done.  Aside from my not being impressed with the food, the loudness of the music here is almost deafening.  It  displays a hard rock-n-roll motif so most people might like it this way.  But it's annoying to have to shout to your friends--at times getting spit on your face for this matter--to be heard during normal conversation. What? What? What? is the most commonly heard word here. The prices are very fair but the wait is excessively long, especially at night.

It was the black oak arkansas with red wine bbq, aged white cheddar, bacon & alpha king battered fried shallots. There was nothing King about this sad burger. 1st, don't put bacon on my burger unless it's crispy, for real. 2, the red wine bbq was freakin nasty; it tasted sour & it was kinda chunky, for a second I thought they put a sour marinara on it by accident but I looked back and there wasn't any marinara they included on any burgers. It was like this chunky red wine bbq sauce was not made out of a nice flavorful red wine, but red wine vinegar perhaps. Hence the sour flavor. Nasty. I also asked for my waffle fries well done.

My brother was friends with one of the managers and he gave us the low down on the meat there. He said that they get there meat blended especially for them, and it definitely shows. I mean the burger was great! It was prepared well, not well done, but good. Everything was fresh and tasty. You ever watch those cooking shows where the cook eats whatever they made and they're oohhing and saying how great it is. Well that was me. The beers are also great. My brother who know more about beers than me suggested some parings with our food, kinda like wine flights. I wasn't disappointed. What was a trip was the loud death and speed metal that was playing and seeing these old white folk just squinting their eyes and shrugging their shoulders. But the food is that good. Another funny thing was that everyone looked the same. All the dudes had shaved heads and full beards. Mega tattooed out, sleeves and all, weird. Being that as it may, come early because it does get packed!",0.992,0.768,0.2,0.032,0.5750534188034189
2011-02-03,2.0,"I have added Kuma's the list of Chicago joints that really need to get over themselves. Its a burger, not cold fusion. As an american archetype, your best bet is just try not to completely screw it up. On that front, they're very close to crossing the line. Some of the things on their menu appear to be made up stoner snacks. And not the good kind. Some of them, on the other hand, just seem like really aggressive ingredients on what should be the star: plain old beef. In itself, that should work. No! Kuma's needs to put about 50 ounces of STUFF on it before they will call it a burger. Flatline this, metalhead: if it doesn't taste good plain, all that crapola ain't gonna make it better. Oh, and ambience: zip, shinola, outtaluck. If you dislike hot, loud, crowded and smelly bars where THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE musical style, I guess you're just tooooooooo lame for Kumas. They're rockin'! But, actually, they're more just poundin'. Like poundin' into my head how frikkin metalastically cool they are, oooooh. I'm sort of shocked smack ISN'T on the menu. Seriously, if you need a list of rules, RULES, for your guests that reads like the welcome card at Auschwitz, you're offically taking yourself too seriously. Now I should wax roxotic about the burgers. But I can't. It was ALRIGHT. Not great, not even all that good, just alright. Congrats, you've constructed an altar to your fantastic douchebaggery and placed upon it an underseasoned, overcooked, oversized, overtopped burger that can't stand up against an average pub burger. Yay! Imma go get like 6 slayer tattoos right now!  Other details: long wait. That's been covered here.  Service: Fine. Nice, actually. Our server was the one thing about the place that didn't scream ""get out now"". Lemme splain. No, is too long. Lemme summup: If you LOVE deathmetal, overcooked food with too many ingredients, and you're certain that somewhere, somehow, someone understands your need to be just too rockin for anyone else to understand....go to Kumas and ask for a job application.

2011-02-02,2.0,"Here's a really quick summary of my experience before you get to the tl;dnr section of my review. Food - decent, big portions Price - moderate not bad for what you get Environment - it's a pub that was rehabbed into a... pub Service - I got my food in under an hour... You can skip the rest of this review if you have a hard on for this place. I went to this spot a little while back after hearing some good things.  It was pretty much, ""OMGWTFLOLz KUMA IZ SOOOO GUD!1!"" so me and a group of buddies decided to make the trip in to the city and give it a whirl. It was probably about 2 or 3 when we went in the middle of the week some time if I remember well.  Perfect time to avoid a lunch rush to get a sweet burger right?  Apparently my assumption was incorrect.   I mean to the restaurants credit, it's not their fault that wait was obscenely long.  The place was simply at capacity and couldn't accommodate all the patrons.  Whatever.  So here is the waiting area situation, it's just people scattered around this small bar/restaurant about the size of my freshman year college dorm room if you super sized it.  People waiting around just crowded tables and the line even bled out into the streets.  Lucky for me there was a nice soft piece of concrete with my asses name on it. I mean I can't believe I'm even going on this long about the wait of this place.  It was that long.  I had my PSP on me and I was able to go through story mode on Street Fighter Alpha 3 with at least 4 or 5 characters!  That with reading the dialog I already knew from playing the damn game so many times back in high school or whatever.  Couple this with chatting amongst my party as to what metal band named burger we are going to eat which by the way is a novelty which in my eyes is quite lack lustered and mildly entertaining if I were to have been 12  and was like ""OH COOL THE PANTERRRRAAA BURGER!"" Anyways, we get seated.  My party is quietly sitting at the table since we've for the most part exhausted our topics for conversation by now.  We're just happy to be seated finally and we already know what we want.  We've had a lot of time to stare at the menu of various burgers while we waited so we put in our order double quick.  It's only a matter of time now since we are sitting at the table and already have our orders in!  Wrong again, me! We sit there for ALMOST and hour after placing our orders and yes, I understand it takes a while to cook a burger through.  I'm not a dumbass, I've cooked meat before.  I get it.  I also understand the place is busy but they seriously must have like 1 grill going with one guy getting one burger at a time ready.  I mean this place just serves burgers.  Could we sort of... ya know... prep some of it a little bit more in advance?  It's not like I was leaning towards the pasta or something.  There should be a nonstop stream of burgers being cooked from before the doors open so I only have to wait 45 minutes for a damn burger and not 60.  Well the food is here so let's just get to what this review should be about.  The good part about the place. The burger I had was nice.  I believe it was the vanilla flavor of the place.  The kuma burger I think it was called.  Burger with fried egg.  Can't go wrong.  Honestly though, it tasted like a really big burger.  That's about it.  I wasn't blown away by it or anything like that, but I didn't NOT like it by any means.  All I'm saying is that it's just a burger with a bunch of shit on it.  Why are people going bananas over this place?  The pretzel bun was a good touch IMO and I got a chance to sample some of the rest of my party's burgers also not bad.  So kudos to you Kuma's. To me, this entire experience was like the remake of Godzilla.  There was a lot of hype and the trailers looking amazing but when I finally saw it I was just like oh... that was just alright.  I mean it fixed my burger craving but I wouldn't ever recommend anyone to go out of their way to go here.  I guess the hype really killed it... and the fact we actually waited through all that.  I guess shame on me. But as the hipster patrons of this place would probably say, ""I used to go to Kuma's but it got too mainstream""",0.9916,0.833,0.116,0.052,0.5576017943409248

I was well versed on what a visit to Kuma's entailed, but I'll admit, I was daunted. I suspect the wait time is part of an attempt to scare off the weak at heart. Like Atreyu in ""The Never Ending Story"" and Corey Haim in ""The Lost Boys,"" we were tested to be brave and single minded in our pursuit, and we reaped our reward. Once we decided to brave the wait, we actually scored seats at the bar in under twenty minutes, and were happily sipping Three Floyd's Alpha Kings and scoping the daunting burger list by 6:15. Now, I don't eat meat. For the most part. But I make exceptions when it's important, and Kuma's struck me as important. We shared an Iron Maiden burger and a mac n' cheese (we ordered broccoli and mushrooms, we received bacon and mushrooms, which, in other circumstances would've required a send-back, but in this case just made me laugh heartily while eating the heck out of that delicious heart-stopping cheesy mass).  The burger was decadent in the most lovely sense of the word. It was like desert and dinner and post-dinner make-out all in one. The pretzel roll was the perfect chewy host for its greasy sumptuousness.

Loud, Angry Heavy Metal Music is played all day, every day so if you can't deal with it do not go! 2. It is a first come first serve based upon the size of your group! They will not put 2 of you at a table that is designed for 6 regardless of how long you have been waiting! If this bothers you do not go! 3. The wait staff are tattooed having, sassy, down to Earth gals who will not put up with your dumb shit! If this type of server will bother you do not go! 4. The hostess girls do not give a shit about how important you think you are and will not kiss your ass! They made Lady Gaga wait in line just like everyone else so do you think you will get special treatment? No! If this might bother you do not go! 5. If you like to order plain burgers or just want to order a cheese burger you might not want to go to Kuma's! But hey there is a Burger King at the corner lame ass!  6. If you do not like craft (microbrewed) beers and will want to order a Miller Light you might not want to go!  7. If you want to watch the Cubs or Sox game and might get offended when the bartender tells you she is not turning off the bizarre karate movie that is playing for you then you might not want to go! 8. If you plan on going to Kuma's and not order a burger why the hell are you even reading this review stupid? Kuma's is a burger joint plain and simple! Go find yourself another place to eat if you are not looking for a burger! My suggestion is to check out the burger menu before you go to eat. There is a lot of selection when it comes to the specialty burgers. I have tried many of them. For me the Pantera Burger is the best hands down! Not just the best burger on the menu but the BEST BURGER I have ever had! Man I am making myself hungry right now just thinking about it!  I have friends who visit me from cities all over the country and they always make me take them to eat burgers at Kuma's! I would say I have taken at least 20 people there over the past few years and every one of them proclaim the burger they just had is the best burger they have ever had!  I know what I said above about going to Kuma's to eat burgers but I must add that I would kill a man for their Mac n Cheese! I add chicken and bacon. It ROCKS!!!!! I have to order an extra order of it now to bring home to my neighbors whenever they find out I am going to Kuma's ! It is that good! Lastly do not be a douchebag and bring your children to Kuma's! This is NOT a tourist destination! It is a bar that just happens to make the best burgers around! Children do not belong in bars!

2011-01-16,3.0,"Entering Kuma's at about 12:20 in the afternoon I was told by the hostess that it would be about an hour and a half. That's cool I was expecting a wait. Then the people in front of me said to the hostess, ""Hey, you just told us three hours."" She said dismissively, ""It changes.""  So I had family in town who love Kuma's. I always liked most everything about it too aside from some unnecessary attitude and a crazy wait. I knew I was getting close to being seated when the people who arrived right before me sat down. But then I noticed one of the bartenders had come to the other side of the bar to give some friends who had just walked in a hug and a chat. He then approached the hostess - - Easy to see where this is going and sure enough they were seated next a half hour later. Now, this I can easily overlook because I have been lucky enough to be the friend on the other side of this equation.. But there was another party (same size) waiting who came in about an hour after me and then they were seated next. Okay.. time to ask what the deal is? So I just ask what the ETA is and clearly annoyed with me she barked, ""Do you wanna see my list!?"" Um... nooo, I just wanna be seated in the right order hopefully in this century.. Then she tells me there are still 5 or 6 parties ahead of me as if to rub some salt? Huh? I knew this was utter bull shit but I bit my lip. She came back about 5 minutes later and seated us after 2 1/2 hours. I don't know what happened to the the other 5 or 6 parties.  Now, I'm annoyed but I've had a couple of excellent beers (oatmeal stout) which were not easy to obtain w/ one bartender on the wrong side of the bar talking to friends and the other talking to friends on the right side... Sooo I move on to the reason we are here. Their mac and cheese with prosciutto, caramelized onions and mushrooms is AWESOMELY delicious. I think the caramelized onions are what make this a hit. The burger was cooked perfectly and very tasty. I've read people saying they are under seasoned. I don't understand - If it's good beef is a bunch of seasoning necessary? Plenty o' flavor with all the fixins they pile on. I had the Neurosis with sauteed mushrooms, swiss, cheddar and horseradish mayo -- I didn't see any caramelized onions though they are supposed to come with it.  Our waitress was great. She was friendly and on top of things even though it's crazy slammed in there. I can see where someone could be having a bad day and it would be easy to become annoyed working in this environment where the chaos never lets up. But same goes for your customers who would like to eat this year and have been standing around this human pin ball machine for two hours.  Listen -  I get the wait (when it's fair) I don't like the ""I'm too cool for school"" crap even if it's your schtick like Ed Debevic's - in which case my bad.  It will probably be a while before I go back. If ever. For me it's great food but not good enough to compensate for the wait and the tude - specially if I'm going to wait more than 2 hours to spend over $100 for mac & chz and burgers plus a hefty tip (yes, I still tip even when service is lacking). I'm not expecting my ""ass to be kissed"" but you don't have to be an apathetic jackhole either..

2011-01-16,5.0,"Oh dear blissful sweetness and everything good about food. I don't know how they did it but Kuma's Corner created the best burger I ever ate.   The downfall?  It is only available until the end of January because it's their burger of the month: The Solace Burger What's really crazy about this burger is that it can be considered a burger, a patty melt, or even a grilled cheese sandwich (you'll see what I mean).  It is a big @$$ beef patty sandwiched between a slice of Gruyere cheese on each side (this part alone drew me to get this burger), bacon, and sweet onions that were braised in a beef broth.  Here's the kicker though, instead of the burger being on a pretzel bun (as the rest of their burgers are), the burger is on grilled rye bread. Maybe it was the dark lighting of the place.  But when the burger finally came out with waffle fries, it looked like a behemoth of a burger.  The size of this burger truly screams MANBURGER.  Then there was the obstacle of getting to the beef patty portion of the burger.  Yet on the way, I had the best Grilled Cheese sandwich I ever had.  The combination of the braised sweet onions, bacon, Gruyere cheese, in combination with the taste and texture of the grilled rye bread was something different that seemingly filled a small hole in my heart (as well as a few arteries... hey you got to pay the price).  Now don't get me wrong, the beef patty was HUGE.  The rye bread was just was big sticking out the sides.  Once I finally got to the patty though to complete the taste sensation... GAME OVER.   Note: I wasn't starving or under any drug influences while eating this.  In fact I had just got done eating an awesome Japanese BBQ (thanks Gyu Kaku) not even an hour before eating at Kuma's Corner so I was quite stuffed.  Also the waffle fries aren't anything extraordinary and quite frankly bland without salt and pepper.  Yet none of that mattered... The taste of the burger alone forced me to finish that burger in that sitting.  It breaks my heart to know once February comes that this blissful part of my life cannot be relived as it will live in folklore from that point on.  Please Kuma's Corner...

Inside there is heavy metal playing and lots of unique art both on the walls, the waitresses and the patrons. The beer list was as unique as the burgers so I had a hard time choosing. I finally decided on the J.K. Scrumpy's hard cider which not only sounded tasty but came in a 22 oz bottle. I decided on the Plague Bringer burger because it sounded delicious and I didn't have to worry about kissing any time in the near future. I knew ahead of time these were 10 oz burgers but I think it is 10 oz after cooking as compared with everyone else's measurements before cooking. I watched customer after customer have to box up the remainder of their burger but I knew I could handle it. Plus I had crappy food the night before so I was dying for something tasty. The couple sitting next to me said they were there from Iowa and never missed it when they were in town and actually knew Plague Bringer and had eaten their burger with them. It must be a good burger if the band it's named after approves of it. My mountainous burger arrived on a unique pretzel bun with waffle fries. Roasted garlic mayo, tortilla strips, hot sauce, fresh garlic, pepper jack, and sliced jalapenos were piled up high on it. I took a few bites as I rotated my burger, like an ice cream cone trying to get to the goodies inside. Tortilla chips were flying everywhere and jalapenos kept trying to escape. Even without all the yumminess on top, the burger itself was really delicious.

I understand that upon entering this restaurant that it's totally appropriate and often necessary to grow a backbone, which I did gladly to try one of their burgers. But in the grand scheme of burgers I've eaten was not the really all that memorable of a burger at all. That being said, a group of friends wanted to get together and have a reunion of sorts over beers and burgers, and after having had a good experience this past summer we agreed to return to Kuma's. Our party was a group of 7, which due to some policy unbeknownst to me, makes us impossible to seat. Our options were to split the party up, or say we only had 6 and then try to seat the 7th person at the last minute with an unused chair. Upon her arrival, the 7th person was greeted by the hostess who simply refused to seat her with the party she was there to meet offering the options of sitting at the bar by herself or just plain leaving. She then rudely asked the person waiting to be seated ""Are you even 21?""  She then disappeared to go find Black Beard - I mean the manager - who told us plain and simple that there were ""No joiners allowed and that it would screw up the burger orders"". They refused to let us pull up a chair from a nearby table of four which only had a party of two sitting at it, and generously let me squeeze onto the edge of a friend's seat, order a beer, and not order anything off of the menu. THANKS, how very kind.  When it came time to pay, everyone threw down their respective credit cards and cash, which the server responded with ""We don't split checks here. But given the bullshit experience you had earlier, sure why not - but please don't write about this on Yelp"". So here we are. A simple refusal to seat a customer based on ""policy"", yet a breach in policy to take our money. What is that about? I left hungry and completely pissed off. I understand the need for policy and abiding by set rules - however arbitrary they may be, but seriously this place could care less about the customer which leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

You see how methodical I was about getting this burger?  This took major planning, folks! All of that and I STILL had to wait 45 minutes for a seat at the bar. The place is small and it was packed.  They were quoting 2 hour waits for people wanting tables.  Crazy!  Anyhow, I finally get a seat and order a draft beer. They have an awesome beer selection of craft beers.  Unfortunately, the one I requested was out.  The bartender was very sweet and recommended a few others.  No biggie, I chose another and then ordered the Lair of the Minotaur burger cooked medium.  It came out in about 8 minutes.  It was freaking perfectly delicious in every way and cooked just the way I asked.  It was huge, but manageable after cutting it in half.  The beef patty is really large and a bit overwhelming but it's seasoned so well, you don't mind after a while. The waffle fries were awesome as well. All in all, it was a superb meal.  Definitely one of the best burgers I've ever had.  I'd even recommend coming here alone because the music is so loud and it's so crowded, it's not like you can have a decent conversation with anyone at all.  Go have an awesome burger and good beer and get the hell outta dodge and let the next person have your seat.  It's not supposed to be a dining experience.  Everyone was annoyed at the people sitting around leisurely having drinks and taking up space.  I guess it technically is a bar, but really, everyone was there for the burgers!",0.9891,0.762,0.163,0.075,0.6556037414965987

My main beef (ahem) with the burger I got was that it was way too big, specifically the patty. It wasn't really all that tasty, either, and in any case I would have preferred to be able to better taste all the unique ingredients on my burger (such as pear). In fact I didn't finish mine, I actually asked one of the attractive-yet-intimidating waitresses if there was a smaller patty one could order and I think she did her best to choke back a sneer while replying (I find it hard to believe she eats burgers of that size with any regularity, but I guess us menfolk are supposed to gulp it all down).

I used to come here a few times a year, and got a lot of my friends hooked, but we're all through. The tourists and yuppies can have you. Why? Because THE OWNER OF THIS PLACE SCAMMED MY FRIENDS OUT OF MONEY. One of my good friends, and another frequent customer, placed a take out order and wanted to pay using the gift card she received for her birthday. She made a huge order but still had over $20 left on her card, and the world's worst waitress (see following rant) refused to let her keep the difference! When she called the owner himself, he backed up the waitress and gave her some lame, nonsensical excuse as to why gift cards can't be used more than once. I see NO reason why a gift card can't be used more than once, especially when the card was purchased less than a month prior! I can only guess this rule was enforced to pressure people into buying more drinks with their cards instead of using them repeatedly on food. So, GIFT CARD USERS BE WARNED. They obviously don't give a shit about customer service here. Secondly, in one of my previous reviews I mentioned that the once-awesome fries were replaced by mediocre waffle fries and that I wish they'd bring the old ones back. I jokingly remarked that they taste okay when you slather them in a ""sriracha/ketchup hybrid"" and lo and behold, that combination started to come standard with the fries. *eye roll* What a jackass move! Way to totally miss my point and continue cutting corners. Lastly, the frumpy, butchy and eternally crotchety waitress that always wears a beanie is one of the worst I've ever been served by. That bitch needs to go. 2 of my friends and I went here on a Monday afternoon and were immediately seated at a large table that could seat 5, but she wouldn't wait just five bloody minutes for my boyfriend to get there because *apathetic voice* ""we don't allow join-errsss."" Oh, okay. Since it was a slow afternoon I'm sure the place could've used the business, don't you think? Mmm, guess not. I guess she also doesn't mind losing regulars because she is the reason me, and many of my friends, were turned off this place for good. I loved coming here for a few years and always had a kickass time, but I will no longer support a business with such shitty practices and service.

We decided it would be dumb and pointless to wait that long at the restaurant for a seat, so we headed to Sprinkles Cupcakes further downtown. By the time to we drove the Sprinkles and got back it was an hour and a half later. And seriously, as soon as we walked back in they called our names...how awesome! We probably got the best seat in the house. We sat back in the far right corner and it's probably the best spot because the only one who comes by the table is the waitress. Unfortunately if you sit at a table up near the front entrance you'll probably have people hovering over and bumping into you throughout your entire meal. Our waitress immediately came over to our table and let us order drinks and appetizers. We went with the pork fries and man were they heavenly. Tons of crispy and hot waffle fries, topped with mounds of delicious and fresh BBQ shredded pork, followed with heaps of jack cheese all melted on top. Simply amazing. They told us it would be a bit longer for them to make our burgers because they were cleaning the grill. We figured this would mean an hour but we probably only waited about 25 mins for our burgers to come, although the pork fries came out in about 10 mins.  I ordered Clutch, my brother ordered the Led Zeppelin, and my sister went with the Kuma Burger. Each were cooked to perfection and delicious. The pretzel buns are amazing.

All of the burgers look awesome, and I always intend to branch out to try new ones, but I always capitulate to ordering the Kuma's Burger--it is pretty hard to improve on a burger with bacon, egg, and cheese on it.  This burger has been copied by many restaurants in Chicago, and I have never had one that was more than 70% as awesome as the one from Kuma's.   The fries that accompany the burgers are just average, but this isn't enough to detract from the overall experience.  You need a good beer to wash down your burger, and Kuma's comes through with a solid beer list.   I have been to Kuma's 3-4 times and never waited more than 30 minutes, but I have always gone before 6pm.  If you don't like waiting around for two hours, then don't go to a famous restaurant at 8pm on a Saturday--duh.",0.9654,0.855,0.117,0.028,0.5326238576238576

I had the ""Yob"" which is named after an Oregon 'doom-metal band,' which consists of the burger on the pretzel roll (as it seems all of the burgers do), roasted red pepper, bacon, gouda and what I think was a garlic aioli. Upon first bite, the burger tasted like a stuffed pepper in a sandwich. I ate about 80% of the burger together and then sort of ""dissected"" the rest and ate it part by part. For a burger that's the best burger in Chicago, I would definitely say that each part is good. The pretzel bread is soft and tasty. The burger, while certainly not juicy, was well-seasoned and actually had a flavor (where I feel like most do not). The ""toppings"" were fresh and tasty as well.  So, do I think it's the best burger in Chicago? Well, I really can't conclusively say since I've not eaten every other burger in Chicago. At the same time, I couldn't think of one I liked better. And for restaurant ambiance, I have to say that even though ""metal"" is not really my musical scene, it was kind of refreshing to eat somewhere where the music was heavy, loud and not bland. It was also refreshing to get away from the ""anything goes for the customer"" type of buttoned up, traditional service. If a customer were to act like a dickhead, I can see one of the employees putting them in line. And frankly, that's how it should be. Anyway... If you're sort of on the fence, you should go for it.

Anyways, I'm not one to fault a restaurant for long wait times so the 3 stars are for the food. I tried the Kuma's Burger and the Minotaur. While the toppings are interesting (well, not so much on the Kuma's Burger), the meat patty itself was only ok. It didn't taste seasoned at all (and I'm one who usually finds restaurant food too salty). Perhaps the chef forgot to season our batch bc this was the case for all the burgers at our table. Also, I didn't think the meat was super high quality as other reviewers had stated. It's no McDonald's patty but I didn't think it was better than any other non-fast food joints. The pretzel bun was the highlight of the meal.  Not sure if Chicagoans don't have many good burger joints so Kuma's stands out, but I think I will stick to hot dogs when in Chicago.

I should start by saying that my husband and I came here on a Tuesday at 2pm, and while we didn't have to wait, we snagged literally the last open table in the place.  So even though we came on ""off"" hours, the place was still packed.  Even the bar was entirely full.  We got lucky (we even got lucky with a primo parking spot!)  So as far as the waiting...yes, I hear it's bad.  Yes, if it was this crowded on a Tuesday afternoon, I'm sure nights and weekends are atrocious.  And yes, I would easily and happily wait 3 hours on one of those said nights or weekends just to eat here again (although I think sneaking in here early on a weekday is the way to go...and an excuse to play hookie at work). So first, this place is TINY.  Teeny tiny.  I knew it was small, but it was even smaller than I imagined.  I LOVED the vibe...there was just something about it.  It reminded me of one of my favorite bars, Lunar in Villa Park, if it was half the size, blared metal, and served burgers.  Yes, it is LOUD in there, and I don't even care.  The pics on the walls were awesome.  The waitresses were tattooed-up, hot as hell, and sweet as pie.  The place is just METAL.  *hearts* They only had awesome microbrews on tap.  And while there weren't a TON of taps, the selection was good and there was absolutely no Bud/Miller/Coors crap up in this place...win!  Since this place is tiny, the kitchen is even tinier, and I have to say that is was actually fun to watch the awesome chef work his magic in such a small little space.  And magic it is... So the food...I almost wish I was hungrier or with a few more people so we could have justified ordering some appetizers.  I saw some amazing looking things come out of that kitchen that I would have loved to try.  They have some other things on their menu for entrees that looked good too, but being a burger place, I had to order a burger (and while I like burgers, I hardly ever actually order one from other restaurants).   As a first-timer I just got their traditional ""Kuma Burger"" which had cheese, bacon, and a fried egg on top (all their burgers are also served on a pretzel roll...which imo, totally makes the burger).  It was just perfect.  The meat itself was unbelievable...it tasted like a tender piece of steak on a bun.  It was cooked perfectly.  It was hands-down the best burger I've ever had. I tried my husband's burger too, which was the Black Oak Arkansas.  I think it was even better than mine (and mine was the shit)...the red wine bbq sauce, the fried shallots...all the flavors were just perfect together.  I can't wait to try some of the different and unique burgers on the menu in the future.  And while, yes, I am certainly planning on a future visit, I probably won't make it back to Kuma's too often.  I'd be 300 pounds and on my way to a quadruple bypass in an instant.  But a good burger once or twice a year?  Yes please!  And Kuma's it will be!",0.999,0.75,0.22,0.03,0.6133616780045351

The accompanying waffle fries were among the best I've ever tasted. Though the burgers are a bit on the pricey side -- a whopping $13 for the Lair -- you're bound to have leftovers with this enormous meal.  Whoever thinks of such tempting topping combinations is quite inventive. Our server was very friendly and made recommendations to help us narrow down our burger options.

I had to have it.  When it came, it was a true beast. The beef was true medium rare, the pretzel bun held it's own and the pico de gallo had a nice kick. Waffle fries were the best I've had and were picked off one my one by my assassin duo of mouth and hand. I had the gusto to finish that burger, and it was a brave effort on Megadeath's behalf.

2010-11-04,5.0,"I was thinking about deducting a star because of the massive wait.. but I just can't do that to Kuma's. Seriously, probably some of the best burgers in the Chi, and I'm not much of a meat-eater recently. I love that they have veggie substitutes, however, vegans are out-of-luck here. They also have mac n' cheese you can choose toppings for, which I was actually able to try with prosciutto and tomatoes. It's decent, but I wouldn't skip on a burger to order it. In case the blaring music didn't give it away, this place is a metal joint, and its burgers are named after popular bands of the genre (I recommend the Iron Maiden). It's small though, and be prepared to wait. When I go here with a group, we pretty much have to spend a good 3 hours waiting outside. But it's worth it for the rare occasion you *have* to have unique burgers (for me, usually people visiting from out-of-town). The last time I was here, however, we were seated right away, but I totally blame that on the fact we got there at 6:30 on a weeknight. When we left, the place was packed.

2010-11-03,3.0,"OK - have to say the hype killed it in the big picture for me. Having to wait for my culturally late Croatian friend left me alone with all my attention to the LOUD thrash metal coming out the speakers - a very annoying play-list during my 45 minute wait - wasn't sure if I was even going to be able to order before having to leave to avoid more pain. But luckily, my friend showed up and my attention was diverted along with a more tolerable play-list and possibly at a lower volume at this point. Don;t get me wrong - I do enjoy some metal - and I knew thats what they play here - but this was over the top. Being my first time, I went for the Kuma Burger with egg, cheddar and fries on the side. Now... a place like this needs to have quality fresh cut fries - for the price - but these frozen fries just don;t cut it for me.  The Burger: If I am about to inhale that amount of cow - it should at-least be meat to be of higher quality and hormone free etc... (there is no mention of the meat origin on the menu) in this age of knowledge with many films out like FOOD INC. - there is no reason for a place with this amount of success not to be doing it right and healthy for their customers. There are few great restaurants in the city that do exactly that - sure their profit isn't as large but the quality and care for their customers is highly respected. Menu creativity is simply awesome - if this place had quality meat and fries - this would be a 10 star restaurant for me. But the last 10% lack of effort is most important in any restaurants long term survival - especially these days with more people educated on corporate food and their personal health. Mac and Cheese - everything everyone said - its so delicious - and I never got into Mac and Cheese really - this destroys the curve for anyone's attempt out there. Beer selection is exactly where I would expect it to be - incredible.

2010-11-02,2.0,"After trying to eat here a couple of times only to show up and see 20 people standing outside waiting to eat, and after 1,700 reviews (overwhelmingly positive) on Yelp, the major let down was inevitable. It is fascinating to see how a burger joint in a fairly remote location of the city has become the most reviewed restaurant in the city. People stand in line for two hours to eat a burger?!?! And then they come out run to their computers and let everyone know how it was worth the wait because they just had the best burger of their lives?? Time for a reality check. I happened to go to Kumas later in the evening on a Monday night and took a seat at the bar with my brother. The place was packed, but luckily we didn't have to wait. The ambiance is different. I was expecting it, so it wasn't like it caught me off guard, but the blaring heavy metal music got annoying pretty quickly. Not my cup of tea and I bet I like heavy metal more than about 1,500 of the people that have posted reviews. The burgers are huge. Too huge for my taste. It is a really thick patty that doesn't really allow for the other flavors to blend well in my opinion. The fries are waffle cut. Nothing to write home about. The potato chips are homemade. Good, but nothing to get overly excited about. Even if you sit right away, the wait is pretty long to actually get the food. It is not cheap. A $13 burger is on the very high end of pricing for a burger. So what is it about this place? I have my theories, but too long to get into it. I didn't get the Kumas ""magic"" that apparently everyone else is getting. Was it terrible? By no means. Was it one of the best burgers I've ever had? Not even in the ball park. Would I ever wait two hours and pay $13 to eat a burger there? Not unless someone had a gun to my head or I simply wanted to have a cool sounding excuse to not be home for 3 hours.  Sorry Kumas.

2010-10-30,3.0,"I had been sooooo excited to come here because of all the hype.  So many five star ratings, this burger has got to be the best right?!?!?!! Hmmm......we didnt think so. We arrived on a Saturday morning around 11:15 on a rainy day and there was already a line! Luckily for us, we weren't that far back in the line so we were able to snag a table.  Make sure that your ENTIRE party is there with you in line, otherwise you end up waiting back in line. They will not seat you until your entire party is there.  We jumped ahead of two people because of this policy. Our waitress was awesome! Service definitely gets 5 stars. We ordered the Slayer (it was HUGE) and the Megadeth (not as huge as the slayer but still BIG). We also ordered the Mac and Cheese with broccoli and prosciutto.  I ordered my burger medium and felt it was a little on the dry side. The flavors were good but did not blow me away. The mac and cheese was on the watery side, but tasted okay. I noticed that if you order an appetizer, the time your burger is made is delayed.  We ordered before some of the people around us but they got their burgers before we did.  They did not order appetizers though.  I thought this was a good idea until I started filling up on the appetizer waiting for my burger to come around.  By the time my burger came, I was already halfway full. Prices here are pricey.  The mac and cheese was $11 and my burger was $13.  We ended up spending almost $70 for food, tax, tip and drinks. I'm not a fan of rock music but the music did not bother me. It was not blaring which I appreciated.  They might play the music louder though in the afternoon/evenings. I think at around 11:30am when we went people were still waking up from the night before so they kept the music softer.  Ventilation is not very good here. You will smell like burgers when you leave, especially if you are seated right next to the kitchen like we were.  Looks like I'll have to continue my quest to find the best burger in Chicago! My friend David D came here in August 2010 with his friend and gave this off yelp review of Kumas. He gave Kumas five stars. I thought I would post it here as well: Okay, You've probably seen their menu and know that all the burgers are named after heavy metal bands. I like that. I opted for the Iron Maiden burger (veggie burger option. I wish I ate meat while at this place.) that came with avocado, some cheese and peppers. It was a bit spicy hot but very good. It was a homemade veggie patty as well. The regular beef burgers were HUGE and I saw a lot of people getting doggy bags. Even my order was too much and I took half the burger home and ate it later. The burgers come with waffle fries or something else but I forgot what the other options were. The fries were really good as well. They have a pretty good beer selection with lots of beers I've never heard of before. I had two pretty good ""Rocky's Revenge"" beers but it was not related to Rocky Balboa, but that's what I hoped when I ordered it. It did take a while for the food to come out but that is a good thing because it gives you more time to talk and soak-up the atmosphere. The place was very busy, very loud. Heavy metal/death metal played over the speakers at I think just the right volume. It could've been a little louder for my taste, but it was loud enough, especially when you add the crowd noise. So you have to raise your voice to talk to your friends. There was interesting art work on the walls. The wait staff was efficient and polite. The bathrooms had a lot of scrawled graffiti on the walls and my friend and I each quoted a clever scribble to each other.

We stood by the bar and I started what would be my tour of the 3 Floyd's brewery with the seasonal Broo Doo. You can always count on Kuma's to have beers that you haven't tried before. We were told our wait would be around an hour and 45 minutes. However, just as I was finishing up the above mentioned deliciousness and ordering a Gumballhead, the hostess found us and seated us. We waited about 40 minutes, IIRC.  The music was at a really good volume level. I've been there before when it's just absolutely blaring and you can't even hear yourself think. Not so last night. Sat down and immediately began the laborious process of picking which slice of Heaven I would get. I've never gotten any appetizers, but after reading about the mac & cheese that will certainly be on my agenda for the next visit. I've tried the Led Zeppelin, Metallica, Mastodon, Brujeria, and High on Fire. Every time I get something different and every time the burger is better than the last one. At least it feels that way.  Last night I got the Mayhem (sliced jalapenos, pancetta, pepper jack, gardinera mayo) and it was phenomenal. I got a side salad because it cancels the chunk of meat and 3 heavy beers I had. (Trust me, I'm a doctor.) I ordered the burger medium rare (usually get medium) and it was the absolute perfect temp. I will definitely be doing MR from now on. My buddy got the Plague Bringer and he forbade me from trying it. Which is ok - if he'd try to get a bite of mine I probably would have stabbed him in the face. Finished off the meal with an Alpha King.  If you haven't tried this place, set aside an afternoon or evening and just get it done.

This was my 3rd attempt to eat at Kuma's (turned down twice before due to 2+ hour waits), and with the stars aligned, my friend and I got in immediately!  We actually turned down a table because we thought a third person was joining us, so we sat at the bar to EAT and DRINK.  (note - this was just shortly after 5pm, so we beat the after work crowd just in time) We had planned this trip for a long time and knew we wanted to split mac & cheese and their veggie burger.  Both phenomenal and huge.  Mac/cheese with brocolli and roasted red peppers (topped with bread crumbs and scallions) - the best mac/cheese I've ordered out, by far.   ""Neurosis"" veggie burger was good too, standard veggie patty, nothing too special there, with carmelized onions and mushrooms and cheese on their delectable pretzel rolls. Pretty tasty.  Tons of waffle fries with it too. Both of us splitting things and eating like hogs, we still had 1/2 a plate of the mac/cheese left, and plenty of leftover fries.  Excellent for leftovers later...    *Sidenote, we ordered a burger to-go for our third person, and that was pretty smooth time-wise, quick and easy.  I'll definitely order to-go again, because who knows how long it will take for me to get in and get seated again...",0.9852,0.829,0.146,0.026,0.4606048166392994

This place is notorious for having a wait for at least an hour no matter what time of day you go. If you plan on going at regular dining hours for lunch or dinner you could be quoted 2 hours or more. The dining room is extremely small and as the patio begins to close for Winter the seating decreases dramatically. Our group arrived on a Sunday afternoon at 4pm and were quoted an hour wait. Luckily we happen to be seated in half that time. While we were waiting to be sat we enjoyed some beers at the bar. They have a unique selection of beers to keep you from getting parched! As we sat down I was excited and ready for eat. We all opened the menu and immediately decided we were coming back again. They have soooo many burgers to choose from with creative toppings that seem endless. I ended up getting the Metallica Burger which was buffalo sauce, blue cheese and bacon! (Rock music blasts full volume throughout the restaurant, hence the name of the burger) It was a little slice of heaven....ok by little I mean HUGE. They are not shy why they make a burger and this thing will FILL YOU UP!! I was so incredibly full half way through but the taste was so worth it I just kept going. Needless to say I rolled myself out of the place upon completion. I read reviews about how good their Mac N Cheese is and didn't have room to try it this time. They have so many burgers I don't want to risk missing another chance to try one. In time I will try it out! Overall, yummy yummy yummy in my tummy tummy tummy!

Interesting environment with an eclectic array of customers from young rockers, bikers, to families with children.  Be aware of loud rock music constantly playing, but there is a back patio eating area. The kitchen seemed to operate with only 4 employees cranking out the delicious burgers, and viewable from the eating area which was fun to watch their cooking methods.

2010-10-17,5.0,"We arrive at Kuma's around 10:30. We put our name in for a table, even though the hostess informs us that our entire party must be present for us to be seated. We find the ladies seats at the bar and I'm intrigued by 22oz bottles on the beer menu - I end up with a Stone Brewing's Imperial IPA because my first selection was not in stock. Good conversation ensues at the bar as I work my way through this 10% ABV, rich, deliciously hoppy, yet somehow not very bitter, beverage in a fancy footed pilsner glass. As I down the last drop, our group finally becomes complete. A cigarette and a bathroom break later (the bathrooms are awesome, by the way) were seated and my friend and I are splitting another 22 ouncer: Three Floyd's Broo Doo Harvest Ale. It's simply divine, rich and honey-sweet up front, citrus-hoppy on the way down; and I contemplate it's complexity as I order the Megadeth: complete with chorizo and red potato hash, pico de dallo, tortilla strips, and CAYENNE AVOCADO CREAM. In my experience, a mere burger cannot come close to the level of spiciness that I require, but let me assure you, Megadeth took me to town. Every bite brought Megaspice to my pallet and Megatears to my eyes, but between sips of Broo Doo and h2o I could not tear my mouth away from that delicious burger. Unbelievable, and ridiculously rich in flavor, Kuma's  has the ultimate in Spicy Burgers. Although the rather crispy waffle fries left something to be desired (I like my fries closer to the soft side - to each his own), I polished off the meal with Canadian brewer Unibroue's La Fin du Monde. My date informed me that the translation from French means ""The End of the World,"" which is more fitting than even the brewer could know. (No tasting notes besides the fact that I loved it and that it reminded me of Delerium, I was fairly sloshed at this point) Bad Apple and The Portage, step aside. Kuma's taught me how to really eat a burger, enjoy the shit out of it, and not need to worry about anything else. Anime on the TV, gothic/tattooed waitstaff, loud metal music and even louder but very un-metal patrons, all contribute to the atmosphere; but on a pedestal are those goddamn delicious burgers.

Lastly, the hostess.  Absolute bitch.  Though it did not ruin my overall dining experience, it certainly hurt it.  With unpleasant attitude abound, one would think that she would have quit this job months ago, but no no, she is there.  Still plugging away.  Still handing out dime bags of attitude.  Kuma's can do better than her.  Way better.  Don't let dimebagbitches drag you down.

Imagine waiting for your favorite artist to go on stage only to completely let you down with a lackluster performance. That's Kumas in a nutshell. I had the burger with the fried egg on it. Had it been any good I would have remembered the name. I ordered it medium well, got it dry. Didn't realize dry was a way to order red meat. Kuma's can hide behind it's Rock-N-Roll mystique to cover it's lack in taste when it comes to the burgers, but there not fooling anyone who was born and raised in Chicago. The only reason it got 1 star from me was because the Mac-N-Cheese was pretty good. You want good food for half the price and half the wait go across the street to Square Bar.

However, only 3 of us came first, so I think we would have been seated in 30 minutes if the whole party was there (SO TO AVOID WAITING THE FULL HOUR, COME WITH EVERYONE).  I was like, seriously though? An hour? At 9PM on a MONDAY night, redic. So we got some beers. I had the Original Sin Pear Cider. And I've had apple cider before, but this stuff was way better. 7.8% alc by volume, just FYI. So by the time I sat down, I had a good buzz going. It was still mind boggling to me to have to wait so long for a dumb burger. I cursed all my friends for wanting to go here -- what's the big deal?  And yelpers, the big deal is when you have that first bite. The meat is so succulent and tender, it figuratively blows your effing mind away. I forgave my friends so quickly, and continued eating my High on Fire burger, which came with a side of # (waffle) fries. My friend picked a burger based on a band's name without looking at what's in it, and he still loved it. I give them a lot of props for the originality.  Our server was friendly, no complaints there. We sat all the way in the back, and they had the back door open, so we were freezing our butts off while we were enjoying our burgers. They are also forgiven.

I was lucky enough to check this place out with one of their former cooks who broke down the magic behind the calamari. They marinate it in buttermilk, fresh lemon juice, rosemary and jalapeno for 24 hours. They fry it up with lemons, rosemary, jalapeno and all...YUM! They had an awesome selection of beer. I was introduced to Three Floyds Gumballhead American Wheat. Perfect with the heavy fare.

I usually add the fried egg to complete it all. They also serve waffle fries which are pretty damn good. One thing her tho is that they dont have any of the domestic beers such as miller light or bud light. They have a wide variety of european beer which are pretty strong. Another down side is the waiting. It all depends on what time you go. Usually after 4 is when it starts to get crowded. My first time experience there wasn't to pleasant. We ended up waiting for about an hour and a half and then another 40 mins for our food. It was worth it but when you're really hungry coming from the gym. I suggest you jus go somewhere else.

I ordered the blue cheese and bacon fries for an appetizer.  The fries were perfectly cooked and lightly salted.  Can't go wrong with blue cheese or bacon!  Total comfort food. Next up was a caesar salad - this was also very good.  The croutons were made from left over pretzel rolls.  The dressing was creamy and light and the lettuce was very fresh.  One of my favorite things on earth is a great caesar salad - this ranks as the second best caesar I've had. Finally, the burger:  I chose the Led Zeppelin.  The Led Zeppelin is topped with bacon, pulled pork, cheddar cheese and pickles.  You can never go wrong with bacon or pickles in my book.  The pulled pork was moist and probably some of the best I've eaten.  Burger was juicy, bun was great, no ketchup needed!  However, by the time the burger arrived I had almost eaten my fill of fries and salad and had to take most the burger home.  The leftovers were heaven!   Definitely will be returning, especially to try the Mac and Cheese.",0.9976,0.768,0.217,0.016,0.5206306306306306

It was honestly, a little bit of a disappointment, compared to their regular burgers. It just didn't seem right-like something was missing. The second time I was-and still am on a diet so while my friend wanted to go for a late night run to Kuma's I wasn't for it but I obliged him since he's only in town for a few more days. Incidentally, going late at night might be the best option for a wait free visit. We were the obligatory a-holes who came in 30 minutes before the kitchen closed and it was dead so we got our food quickly.  I saw an okay choice-a turkey sloppy joe and by burgers it was delicious-served on the same roll as the burgers but with a very nicely spiced- hot but not too hot mixture that went down well and was a surprisingly healthier and still delicious choice than their hearty, but 'only on a cheat day' burgers. Sorry though-the burger of the month for 9/2010 was a little underwhelming.",0.9737,0.788,0.143,0.069,0.5300213675213675
2010-09-20,1.0,"I so wished my first (and probably only) experience at Kuma's was a good one but unfortunately, it was one of the most terrible experiences I've ever had with customer service at a restaurant.  Just like most people who love food, Kuma's had been on our list of places to try for a while and we finally made it over this weekend. We showed up 15 minutes after they opened and were faced with a 45-minute wait. No problem. About an hour later, two seats opened up at the bar (the bar is first come, first served). I ask the hostess where we were on the list and our table-for-two was second up. So, I figured instead of sitting at the bar and getting bumped by the people waiting for their tables, we decided to wait for our table. I noticed that the people that were just ahead of us got seated and I started licking my chops, we were next! My wife decides to go the restroom and the next table for two opens. The hostess grabs two menus, looks over at me and asks where my other diner was, I said she went to the ladies' room and said she could go ahead and seat me and my wife will catch up on her way out. Nope, the hostess couldn't do that and instead, seats the next twosome on the list. In bewilderment, I asked the hostess if we lost our table because my wife went to use the restroom. She said no. Then, another table opens up and the hostess seats another group of people. My wife comes back from the ladies' and notices me still standing there and other people getting seated and asks the hostess what happened. The hostess tells my wife that we had to both be there to get seated. WAIT! MY WIFE WENT TO TAKE A PISS! We were still there, it's not like we went over to Hot Doug's for an appetizer. So, I ask the hostess why she told me we didn't lose our table when in fact, we did. She again, said we had to both be there and I again, reiterated, this time a little more angrily, that in fact, we were both there but my wife went to use the ladies' room. While all of this is going on, a table opens up and the hostess seats us. I think great, this ordeal is done and let's enjoy our food. As we walk up to our table, the guy is still cleaning the table and the hostess tells him, ""it's clean enough, don't worry about it"" and throws down the two menus and our place settings.  Are you kidding me? Did we deserve this type of treatment? C'mon, Kuma's. I know you're cool and hip and your food was awesome (it really was). You're always packed and even if you were open 24/7, you'd probably still have a wait but do I really deserve to be treated like this?  So, the moral of the story... if you're waiting for a table, and you're coming up on the list, DON'T GO TO THE RESTROOM. You may lose your place and get treated like crap from the hostess.  The food was great but unfortunately, being treated like we were degenerates just ruined our experience.",0.9803,0.831,0.105,0.064,0.5105105105105106
2010-09-19,2.0,"What a delightfully refreshing place. First off, the burger selection is crazy good. Not only did they sound awesome due to being named after metal bands (Slayer, Iron Maiden, etc), they were all totally different regarding the ingredients. There is pretty much a burger here for every type of person. The alternative atmosphere inside is great all the way from the tattooed waitresses to the metal & rock in the background.  The HUGE downfall to Kumas is the amount of waiting you have to do. We went in the late afternoon, waited ~30 min to get a table, and then ~45 min to get our food. Add the amount of time it takes to eat and get your check and you're pretty ready to move on with your life. You can't help but notice how much sitting around that you're doing. The service isn't slow. It's just that the kitchen is so effin small so remember that patience is a virtue.

Just today, we walked in a little over 5pm and was seated immediately. Our first trip to Kuma's was marked with a 2 hour wait (at 3pm) on a wednesday in December. Never again! The Service: It's a toss up. With each return, I feel that the waitresses were friendlier and willing to have actual conversations about burger/beer recommendations. Just tonight, she was very attentive and checked back with us. She was quick to refill our sodas without asking.  The Food: a revelation into burgers! I haven't veered off into their appetizers or mac 'n cheeses. When I bring friends who are first timers, they suggest appetizers and I simply tell them that a burger is all they'll need.

2010-09-15,5.0,"Disclaimer: This five-star review is based on a series of serendipitous occurrences that accompanied us on our trip to Kuma's, occurrences that will likely not happen again for us or any of you. Anyway: So my girlfriend and I decide to try Kuma's out after momentous hype. Cognizant of the well-publicized wait times, we decide to go on a Monday around 6:30. We go inside and see the place: a small, darkish, metal themed pub restaurant. S'all good. There's some death metal playing, nothing wrong with that--except it's BLARINGLY loud. Like, ""we can't hear what the maitre d is asking us"" loud. We nod our heads at her, and luckily she was asking us if we wanted to sit outside, because not only were there open tables there, but it was quiet enough for actual conversation. So we get our burgers- a Mastodon for her (BBQ, Bacon, Cheddar, Fried Onions) and a Led Zeppelin for me (Bacon, Cheddar, Pulled Pork, Pickles). First off--the names of the burgers are brilliant. They're all named after metal bands, which could be gimmicky, but is simply too charming not to like (although it's arguable whether Led Zeppelin should still be categorized as metal). The burgers are super thick, ten ounces. I'm usually against burgers over 1/3 a pound because their juices demolish the bun. Kuma's uses pretzel buns, however, which are tough enough to take that kind of beating. The upshot is that Kuma's serves a big burger topped with a mound of toppings that is actually easy to eat. That in itself is an amazing accomplishment. The burgers were cooked perfectly, and delicious. Juicy, flavorful, and with amazing toppings. Waffle fries are always a favorite, but we found Kuma's fries to be just OK--kinda cold and overly salty. But with a burger that good, who's complaining? Service was very friendly and timely as well. Overall a great experience. Now if we had had to wait an hour or sit amidst loud-ass music so we couldn't have even spoken, maybe this wouldn't have been such a great time...but from a food perspective, Kuma's certainly doesn't disappoint.",0.9972,0.759,0.202,0.039,0.629672619047619

2010-09-13,4.0,"I really want to give 3.5 Stars but that is not an option.  I have been waiting to try this place...reading reviews and waiting for the perfect moment and I thought that today was the day! Everyone loves this place but there were a few things I was not happy with.  So I am going to address the negatives first because stuff like this should never happen. First I asked the waitress to bring out my waffle fries crispy and she said, ""Oh you don't have to worry they come out crispy!""  Guess what?  They were room temperature and not even close to crispy.  I was really let down because she brought them to me and she could see they were not even close to what I wanted.  (I typically do not send things back because I do not like pissing off the cook...I really do not want the special sauce added into my food) Second thing that made me mad.  When we got our bill we had a charge of $4.00 marked LTO...which I figured out to be Lettuce Tomato and Onion.  My wife asked the waitress when ordering, ""Does the burger come with Lettuce and Tomato?""  Waitress said, ""Yes!""  When I then asked her why we were charged she said, ""Oh I must have spaced.  The owner has made some changes and has started charging for LTO on some of the burgers!""  You spaced...okay fine then just remove the charge and we will be good.  Yeah the $4.00 charge was not removed.  I would have been happier with spending that money on a beer.  Plus I did not even eat my lettuce because it was brown and wilting...I really got screwed! I attribute the above two things to the kitchen or management not wanting the customer to tell them how to make or serve there food.  In fact, the menu has a $2 charge called  the HASSEL CHARGE, if you want to add anything to your burger that is not part of its official burger toppings you will be charged 2 bucks. (At first I thought that was funny until we got charged for something that the Waitress told us came with our burgers)  The no changes comes off as a litte arrogant but it is probably because they run there kitchen like the gourmet McDonald's...don't make any changes and keep pushing out food. (Also the kitchen looks really small for those poor cooks.) Okay those are my negatives. Positives...the room has a great feel to it...the music is rocking...so the mood of the restaurant is fun and lively.  The staff was very upbeat and happy too.  Our waitress was really good too (with the exception of her spaceout moment that cost us 4 bucks).  She had an amazing personality...Kuma is very lucky to have someone like that on staff. The beer selection is really good too...it is so refreshing to go into a bar and not see Miller Lite or Bud on tap or in a bottle...if you want that then I recommend you go somewhere else. The burger was more of an art piece...the meat was seasoned well and tasty.  I ordered Medium Rare and when I cut into the burger it was cooked perfectly...but it was also steaming hot with smoke flying out of it...in fact my burger continued to cook on my plate...the sad part is that my second half was Medium Well by the time I started eating it...I can only think that the pretzel bun and cheddar cheese kept the heat around the burger and it continued to cook.  So the second half was not as good as the first half.  I have no idea how a kitchen could fix that. Also my burger came with Onion Straws (called Onion Frizzels here) on top of it.  The onion Straws were room temperature towards the colder side.  I wish they would have been warm like the burger...it was kind of like something they made this morning and then just threw it on because that is what came on the burger.  (Opps I said I was going to talk about positives) I am glad that I came here.  I do not think it is worth all of the hype.  I do not know if I will ever come back because the expeience here did not change my life.   I think I can live without a Kuma Burger!",0.9973,0.791,0.15,0.059,0.4989564961787185

The place is dark, really loud, and very rock and roll. Tatted servers go back and forth from the tiny tiny kitchen as heavy metal music blares from the speakers so loud I had a hard time listening to my comrades across the table from me. No biggie - it only adds to the experience. Food listed in the order it was consumed. The appetite kicker was mac&cheese with prosciutto and caramelized onions. This has to be the only fancied mac&cheese I've consumed that didn't taste like a casserole - staying true to its name, elbow macaroni was made with just the right amount of cheese to give it flavor but not make it overwhelming and heavy. The small, crispy pieces of prosciutto and sweet, caramelized onions complemented the dish in an ever-so-playful way.  The famous Kuma Burger - with many familiar flavors of the crispy bacon and melted cheddar along with the surprise of the egg, this was the easiest one to like as it wasn't particularly abnormal. For some reason, the patty was a bit salty but with the mix of veggies and chosen toppings, it worked out to be ok in the end. Neurosis - Sauteed mushrooms, caramelized onions, with cheddar and swiss, it was more muted in flavors out of the 3 even with the horseradish mayo but it's not necessarily bad because the taste of the pretzel roll came much more through with this one (which by the way is so delicious!). Mastodon - frizzled onions, bacon, cheddar and bbq sauce put a nice sweet note to the end of a very savory meal. At this point, E, J & J were about to explode from previous numbers so I gladly ate their portions. Extra meat for me! All the 10oz burgers were accommodated with large waffle french fries that were seasoned simply with salt (there were other options for like a salad or chips).

BFF's BF got a burger all to himself, I think the Mastadon, and she and I picked two to try and went halfsies on each so we could try more. While I love a pretzel bun, the BF thought it competed too much with the burger for his liking.  I was okay with it, but would def agree that they could switch up the jacket based on the what the burger is wearing. The meat tasted decent, although I am (full disclosure!) not a huge beef burger orderer.  I would just as soon ordered a turkey burger but there are no such things at Kumas. The toppings suffer from what many of my dates suffer from: GOP Disorder.  GOP (Good on Paper) means it sounds fan-effing-tastic on the menu but for some reason it doesn't seem to work as well in real life. My suggestion, go to Kumas, if the line is long, go to any of the 43,000,000 other delicious places to eat in Chicago, and come back another day.  If you can get in fairly quickly, thank your lucky deity and be happy you get to cross something off your Chicago bucket list and your alive to drink beers and eat burgers with friends.",0.9908,0.767,0.162,0.071,0.5570833333333333

As far as the food, I had the Kuma Burger--complete with bacon, cheddar cheese, and a fried egg.  I also had a taste of their Mac n' Cheese and the BBQ Pork Fries appetizer.  After reading so much about the burger, I actually walked away a little disappointed.  On the plus side, the burger comes with a really thick patty which was cooked just right at medium-rare (as recommended by our server).  It's actually a small wonder that a patty that thick can be cooked that expertly.  I had to ask myself, though, is this the best burger I've had in Chicago?  Personally, I'd take the 40 Day Dry Aged Prime Steak Burker at David Burke's Primehouse over the Kuma Burger any day of the week (and at a cost of only $2 more). The Mac n' Cheese also failed to live up to the gushing reviews I read on Yelp.  I don't know how it is in Chicago, but Clevelanders are well aware of how prolific some variation of macaroni and cheese appears on the menus of various restaurants.  I am not saying the Mac n' Cheese is particularly bad (as I would say about Chocolate Bar's Mac n' Cheese Bar), but the Kuma's Corner version is easily beaten out by several restaurants just in the Cleveland-area alone. Some would say that 1,600+ reviews and a 4.5 star average can't be wrong.  I think it's all too easy, though, to get caught up in a hype that is not really backed up by substance.  The Yelp rating system summed up Kuma's Corner best:  Meh.  I've experienced better.",0.8642,0.854,0.084,0.063,0.47440476190476194

2010-09-08,5.0,"I'm pretty excited to be posting my Kuma's Corner review.  It actually means that we made it out there and what a great trip this turned out to be!   Taking a random Wednesday vacation day, we decided that it was time to hit one of my top bookmarked restaurants.  12:30pm - parking was a breeze!  We walked up to the door where people were gathered (but not in line) and we walked right in.  No wait.  Super nice hostess!   Right away I see that they sell Sprecher's Cream Soda, so I quickly order one.  The hubby went with RC.  We agree to skip the apps because we really want to enjoy our burgers.  And, we are still glad that we made that decision.  I knew exactly what I wanted - The Megadeth.  I am so glad that I went outside my comfort zone and gave it a try!  Honestly, every burger that we saw looked better than the next.  My burger was perfectly looked, the potato-chorizo hash was spicy & delicious and the crispy tortilla strips gave the perfect crunch.   The Mister tried the Mayem.  He was pleasantly surprised with how much he enjoyed his meal.  He was hesitant about a pretzel roll, but he even liked that!  The waffle cut fries were fine, but the spiced up ketchup made every bite better!   The kitchen is small, but it is open so we could watch the food being prepared and that was a fun surprise.  Our waitress was busy, but pretty attentive for someone being pulled in so many directions. Finally a few general observations...Everybody and their brother was there.  Military personnel, guys in suits on a lunch break, t-shirt and jeans guys and women of all sorts.  Here's my thing though...as a mom, I am pretty sure that this is not a good lunch spot for a toddler or a newborn baby.  I don't judge, but the two year old toddling around and the newborn baby in a carrier caused the neighboring table to comment.  It is crazy loud inside, the pictures on the wall are not kid-friendly and it's basically a bar with about ten tables inside.   Clean, friendly, great for people watching and delicious food.  We are already planning our next trip back!",0.9968,0.757,0.214,0.029,0.5779800809212574

The prices went up, which actually is to be expected, however the quantity has gone down. I'm sure they have changed the beef or the recipe they use for their ground beef because it was a noticeable difference to me. A lot of the staff has changed, which is ok too however, The old staff was really liked and were super nice. The whole vibe of the place has turned in to get em in and get em out with our now about average burger. No more take outs, the beer list has lessened, and I haven't seen a special on the chalk board in quite a while - blamed on the fact they have added some new burgers to the menu.

Kuma's is what it is and doesn't try to change. Its not there to please everybody. Its not turning down its music or serving vegan options to get a bigger crowd. In fact, I think it'd be happier with a smaller crowd, but we just won't go away!  Awesome beer list, perfectly cooked and seasoned GIGANTIC burgers, 'nuff said. I need to go back and have every burger available because I'm pretty sure I would not be disappointed. The flavors went so wonderfully with the beef it almost made me wonder if they season each patty for each burger type differently so that it blends so well. I thought with such a huge burger I would just taste meat with some topping, not the case! It was a mouthwatering experience.  My boyfriend and I are both not a fan of waffle fries, so that was the only thing that stopped our experience from being absolute perfection. However, there is nothing wrong with their fries. They are great. So if you like waffle fries, just ignore this paragraph. Thanks. :) You definitely need to have time to come here. You can't be in a hurry, which is what stopped me before. I'm always running late, I'm always in a hurry. We were waiting for my sister to drive into Chicago and were anticipating a fully vegan evening once she arrived, so we took this opportunity to kill some time and eat some meat.

2010-08-24,4.0,"It was good. It really was. But seriously people, ease up on the fanboy love for this place.  The burgers I've had here (Plague Bringer and Neurosis) were both well-crafted, and most positively, well-toppinged (not sure if that's a word). The Plague Bringer offers what is, in my opinion, the most underused burger topping - fresh jalapeños. The Neurosis was an easy choice for me because of the onions/mushrooms, and they prepared it just right. Now, let me get to my one gripe about the love Kuma's gets: their burger patties are no better than at any other gourmet-style patty (I'm talking chains like Weber Grill, or a Lawry's steakhouse, or your local gourmet place). Further, they do not understand the meaning of the words medium-rare, as both of my burgers were definitely overcooked.  In conclusion, Kuma's knows fixin's, but in my opinion, a true burger-lover judges a burger by the patty.

When you first open the door you're hit in the face with a wall of delicious grease and ground beef smoke. If you weren't hungry before you got there, you are now.  There were so many metal band burgers, I couldn't make up my mind, so I defaulted to the first one on the menu. The Kuma Burger. Fried egg and bacon on top of that ground beef?! Yes please. This place knows what medium rare means, pretzel rolls are the only thing I want my burgers served on now and they have WAFFLE FRIES!  Price is great for the quality of food, you'll be waiting at least 45 minutes for a table (but totally worth the wait) and I recommend sitting outside if the weather permits... that is unless you want the metal music blasting in your ears.

If they were half the size I would be much much happier.  I am considering filleting the patty next time I go; that would make it about perfect.  The macaroni and cheese was delicious and I'd highly recommended it. Like the burgers, the portion is huge. The wait was about twenty minutes on a Friday at 6:00 and we had are food in under half an hour. While we waited for our food the bartender kept the drinks coming. No complaints on the service at all. The burgers, as well as the Mac and cheese are easily enough to split between two people; think twice about ordering a meal for each person in your group.

2010-08-22,4.0,"Even with so many hundreds of reviews, few people are saying what I think needs to be said about Kuma's, which is why I'm writing this. You already know about the spectacular burgers, long waits, and heavy-metal atmosphere -- all true. At its best, Kuma's produces the best burger I've eaten in Chicago: one of the great culinary joys a burger-lover can experience.  Something like that is well worth a long wait if you love food. But Kuma's is *frequently* not at its best because it overcooks the burgers more often than it accurately cooks them.  If you cook a burger beyond medium-rare, you suck out its juiciness and taste.  Many burger places refuse to cook burgers rare or medium-rare because they don't want to take the chance of getting a customer sick from an undercooked burger.  But this refusal prevents those places from selling burgers that taste great.  Kuma's sometimes cooks burgers to order (e.g., rare if you order it rare), but more often will give you a medium-well burger no matter how you've asked to have it cooked. When cooked rare or medium-rare, Kuma burgers are the absolute best.  But when overcooked, as they very often are, Kuma burgers lose their specialness and are definitely not worth the trip or the wait. Kuma's: *please* cook your burgers the way your customers order them.  If you do, and only if you do, you will be contributing something great to people's lives.",0.9805,0.786,0.165,0.049,0.5430158730158731

Another waitress did snap at my one friend about switching tables, but she apologized later, which was really awesome. I could live off of those pulled pork fries forever. Seriously. You're missing out if you don't order them. Mastadon burger=holy crap! who would have thought BBQ sauce and onions and cheddar cheese on a burger could taste so damn good?? It can, my friends.

2010-08-17,5.0,"Some friends were visiting from out of town and I my plan was to take them to unique eateries around Chicago, knowing they were very big fans of food. We got there a little before open on mid day Saturday so we could get in on the first wave as soon as they opened. We were a party of six, so I knew from the start, seating would be hard for us. The place was pretty cool, it had the dive bar feel to it with heavy metal music blasting and people screaming. Definitely not a place to go if you are hung over or want a nice quiet lunch. The demographics of the people eating there varied from metal fans to families from out of town that wanted the ""Kuma experience"". Thankfully we got there early enough, there was no one sitting at the bar, so we decided to take up half the bar. The bartender/waitress was very nice to all of us and very helpful in giving us tips on what to order. She also was helpful to my friend from out of town who wanted a t-shirt, explaining the sizes and different quotes on designs of each shirt and their meanings, this is even when the place was now full. Also, if you sit at the bar, you will notice that they now have 2 or 3 Dyson fans that blow at you, not to strong, just a nice cool breeze, especially on a warm Saturday, a good conversation piece, ha! I ordered the YOB Burger, which consisted of Smoked Gouda, Bacon, Roasted Red Peppers, Roasted Garlic Mayo. Wow, was it good and probably one of the biggest burgers I have ever tried to eat. If you do not enjoy eating a messy burger, this might not be the one for you. I had a hard time keeping my burger together, but it did not matter, it was delicious even if I had to use my knife and fork. I am not sure what kind of beef they use, but it is definitely top notch and tasty!  I also tried the wife's Kuma burger (Bacon, Cheddar, Fried Egg on top of the meat). It was like I was in burger heaven. I love my eggs over easy/sunny side up so putting it on top of a burger patty was brilliant. Unfortunately, these days, it is not a uncommon thing to do anymore. I see a lot of restaurants doing it, but I have to think Kuma's is one of the best in the city if not THE BEST. The beer selection is pretty unique, from PBR's to a bunch of beers I never heard of, but would love to try.

I don't think anyplace I know is more loved simply based on reputation and manages to fall so short of that reputation so consistently.  No burger.... I repeat No burger is worthy of a 90 minute wait. These burgers are simply not that great either. Honestly, I've made the same quality of burger at home and had better at Village Tap, or even at the brownstone sadly enough. Their spicy burgers aren't that spicy. The jalapenos aren't fresh and the cheese isn't nearly thick enough.  I've been here for dine in and for take out. Takeout is pointless since by the time you manage to get someone to take your order, park, muscle your way to the bar you still have to wait 20 more minutes for your burger while getting pushed and shoved out of the way as people try to get their bar service. Dine is is pathetic. Its not like this is in some great neighborhood you can wander around in when they tell you you won't be getting a table on the same day. You have to wait with the other 500 people crammed into way too small of a place.  The atmosphere is just not my style either. If I'm going to spend that much time getting a mediocre burger I don't want to listen to bad music while I do it.  I urge the hordes of Chicagoans that love this place to keep coming here, though, and leave the quality food establishments less crowded for my enjoyment. Thanks.

PS.  Two days later (Sunday) I had it again, but this time at Lollapalooza.  I didn't realize they would be vending there, and it was $11 for a Judas Priest.  I got it, and it was pretty darn good.  It was about two hours before the end of the festival, and another place was trying to get rid of their stuff selling pulled pork sandwiches for $2.  When someone came to announce to the long line of people waiting for Kuma's that they could get a pulled pork sandwich for $2, nobody budged.  It's that good.  In my opinion though the Pantera was better than Judas P.",0.9946,0.746,0.201,0.053,0.4098765432098766
2010-08-13,5.0,"EEEEEEEEEEE! This is exactly how I feel whenever someone says ""hey - lets go to Kumas"". I feel like a small child when someone mentions Chuck E Cheese. Sure, theres nowhere to play...but I get to watch good movies, drink good imports, and eat amazing food. The adult equivalent to me-sized tubes. I've had 3 different burgers there, and each has their merits. Some require extra napkins and some require pretty resilient taste buds because of heat, but theyre so so good! The macaroni and cheese, too...oh my god. Ive attempted many times and failed at recreating this simple but amazing recipe.  Side note - ok, yes, the wait might make you want to kill someone...if you're there on a late saturday night. Ive waited 2 and a half hours before while the place was elbow-to-elbow kind of crowded. Gratned, in the meantime I watched Bikini Samurai Squad and made some friends with people who were also waiting.  If you're not a fan of long lines and being forced to make friendly with strangers...go during the day. I imagine daytime on weekdays is perfect, but I prefer weekends.  Be forewarned...theres boobies all over the walls, theres strange rules posted by the doors, and theres potty-mouths everywhere. So just because you saw it on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives does not mean theyre going to cater to you and your children.  Oh, and the burger that may sound most interesting to a child (comes with a half-pound sausage on the burger) happens to be called the Cock Goblin.

She opted for the Led Zeppelin Burger because we used to make out to side 1 of  Led Zeppelin IV when we were in high school.  She said it might ignite some spark in her when we got home.  I think it would have if that chili didn't catch up with me so soon.",0.6982,0.868,0.077,0.054,0.45525000000000004

2010-07-26,5.0,"Kuma's is all about the death/heavy metal so the decor and music match it. In fact, if you look hard enough, you can find the words ""Die emo, Die"" written on one of the walls. They have Jack Daniels and Makers Mark on tap! ON TAP! Kuma's also has a killer micro brew beer list. The walls are filled with busty vampire/demon pinups and the bathroom has a working sink.  This is a burger lovers pilgrimage because each metal named burger is crafted with unique toppings.  Sure everyone does bacon and some even fried eggs but who's got poblano peppers, panko crusted goat cheese, smoke gouda, chimmicurri, bourbon soaked pears, corn salsa. chorizo stuffed jalapenos or Anger as toppings? Not many, if any at all.  Be ready cause the burger is like a hockey puck of flavor. I have tried the high on fire, the kuma's and the Pantera. In fact, I've eaten two burgers at once and when my burger sweats slowed down, both servers came over to marvel at my feat. Lastly, get the mac and cheese. Each order is enough to feed four and they are made individually in a sautee pan then finished under the broiler. Bacon and prosciutto are noteworthy additions. Be warned that the wait could take up to several hours cause they do not take reservations. At times the bodies lounging outside make it look like a youth hostel. Ones best bet is to put your name on the wait list then (respectfully) hang out by the bar and wait for any patrons to finish their meal while drinking whisky/beer. If a seat appears you could opt to sit at the bar and save some wait time. The place is also a far walk from the Logan station so either take a cab or drive to get here.

2010-07-25,3.0,"Went here last night and were told the wait was ""a couple of hours"" but we decided to wait for bar seats, which were fairly quick (~30 mins). The patio wasn't open, which I guess was a good thing because then the wait would have been...what, 4 hours? Kudos to them for being so popular, but if your wait is that long, you a) have money to expand and b) should. That's just ridiculous. All it results in are lost customers or ones that are annoyed and starving by the time they sit down. On their website and inside the place, they implore guests to ""please have patience"" because their kitchen is so small. Guess what, you're in the service industry--get your sh*t together! Get a bigger kitchen! You've got the customer base for it. If you like death metal music, you'll like the atmosphere here. If, like me, you think it's silly and awful, you will not. It's way over-the-top and the (bad) music is very loud. It's also ridiculously hot in there--I felt so bad for the staff, they must have been dying. We were sweating as we waited--which doesn't really make you want to eat big hunks of meat. Service was faster than I expected, given that the place was wayyy over capacity, and the bartenders were very nice. They have many many kinds of burgers named after bands, which is not helpful or descriptive when trying to choose your food. I got one with goat cheese, kalamatas, oregano, red onions, and tomato. Very good, but the kalamatas would have been better served in a tapenade, rather than very intense bursts of olives every few bites. Ordered it medium and it came almost well-done, but I kept it because I was starving. All the burgers come on a pretzel bun, which is generally a good thing, but there's a time and place for it. On a Greek burger, maybe not. Also, it was pretty dense and didn't go well with the hugeness of the burger. Thought it was wayyy too much food, and everyone in the place had to-go boxes. Overall, I was pretty underwhelmed, which was a bummer given the reviews I read before going.",0.9235,0.759,0.137,0.104,0.5803858024691357

It does have a few non-burger items like the ""Pig Destroyer"" which is a slow cooked pork sandwich and ""make your own"" mac and cheese.

There are few things better than a perfectly prepared burger but add to that a nice pretzel roll with the occasional fried egg and you've just launched your burger into legendary tastiness.  With that said, I've never had anything that made me hate myself in the morning more than the Slayer (Pile of fries topped with a  1/2 lb. Burger, Chili, Cherry Peppers, Andouille, Onions, Jack ) which I asked to top off with a fried egg.  Their mac'n'cheese was nearly as bad weighing in somewhere around 2-3lbs after my wife was done adding toppings.  Good job there Kuma, the buttons off my shirt just popped off just thinking about this shameful display of delicious gluttony. All in all, great burgers.  So why the 3 stars you ask?  Well, I actually wanted to give 3.5 stars.  Primarily for the wait (1 star off); it took anywhere from 45 minutes to well over an hour to get seating.  1/2 star off for having to fight over bar stools with poachers who pretend they've been there for hours stalking a seat when I just saw them walk in.  Even after that, the wait for the food was unusually long (or perhaps staring at others stuff their face with these delicious burgers made it seem like time stood still?).  After a couple of visits, we resorted to carryout - even then it was just as long a wait.",0.9637,0.807,0.129,0.064,0.5781746031746032

Honestly even without the toppings these are exquisite burgers, the wild variety of choices is a bonus. The pretzel rolls they sit on are just perfect for the skyscraper of meat between them, and the jumbo waffle fries never disappoint. However, if you don't explore the other half of the menu you're missing out.  Good calamari, at a burger joint? OMFG yes. They deep fry jalapenos,  rosemary (!!!) and those sweet little red italian peppers you find in the olive bar at whole foods. I wish I knew what they were called... ANYWAY, I've heard numerous raves about the mac and cheese, so that is next to try. Plus they have my favorite burger beer on tap, Three Floyds Gumballhead! Impressive, and worthy.  What isn't is closing the patio at 920 and telling people it closes at 930. What also isn't worthy is waiting 2 hours for anything.

My boyfriend consistently orders the Led Zeppelin which is a burger topped with pulled pork, bacon, pickles and cheddar cheese. I have ordered different burgers, one being a burger that is no longer on the menu, probably because of the glutony, that included a 1/4 pound bratwurst. The burgers come with chips or fries. Typically, I love french fries and would never even think to order the chips, but these homemade chips are delicious, and  I actually prefer them to the waffle fries.

I will add that they also make the best Manhattans in the city and the Mac & Cheese with bacon and scallions will change your life.

However, we were on track for a late lunch, so she thought it would be OK.  We got there, and the place was jammed. Beyond that, it was hotter than hell. If there was AC, I certainly didn't feel any. We left our name with the hostess, and sweat started to gush from my head, cascading down my back and pooling around my butt crack. Nice. Hey, I was born in Florida, I can take it. Three Floyds' Gumballhead on draft helped stave off the heat somewhat as we waited for a spot to open up. Miraculously, shortly thereafter we got seats at the bar. As I looked at the menu with burgers named for metal bands, scanned the surroundings, noted the naked women on the wall, the Jack Daniels and Buffalo Trace ON TAP, the tattooed bartenders, the blaring death metal, the intense heat, it hit me: I was in hell. This place is hell. And surprisingly enough, it turns out that hell is rather enjoyable.  I went with the ""Pig Destroyer"" sandwich, a ridiculous creation of a roll piled high with a mountain of pulled pork. The BBQ sauce was spicy, further adding to the sense of fire and brimstone. If I was hot before, I quickly found myself almost overheating. I ordered a Dark Horse Raspberry Ale to ease the pain, and quickly followed up with a Three Floyds Alpha King. I did not go with the fries with my sandwich, as I really didn't want to see the inside of a Chicago hospital on my vacation.......they gave me a mass of quality greens as a sub, which probably marked me as a total weenie to everyone at the bar. Oh well, I don't care, at least I got a good helping of roughage! My friend ordered a burger, I think it was an Iron Maiden.

I have seen many reviews of Kuma's, here and on Zagat, which state that the service is terrible.  True, we waited for about an hour (after showing up at 9:30), and the hostess was kinda snarky, but honestly, I'm very satisfied.  Our waitress was attentive and friendly (and had the most BEAUTIFUL tattoos on her left arm). We ordered the mac and cheese with sun dried tomatoes and sweet corn.  I really liked it.  My friends noted that the pasta and cheese weren't of terribly high quality, but I really enjoyed it.  I thought the flavors were very skillfully brought together, and it was very creative. Now for the real test: my burger.  Obviously it had to be a garden burger . . .  I have never before in my life had a garden burger I could actually stand to eat.  This was DELICIOUS.  I kid you not.  I ordered a Motorhead, which is a Greek-style concoction of goat cheese, tzatziki, kalamata olives, onion, and tomato.  My friend who tasted my burger said she thought the toppings overwhelmed the burger itself.  I guess that may be true, but those happen to be foods I LOVE, and I pulled a piece of the burger out to taste it plain (I was curious) and nope, it really was good, all by itself.  Even the bun was great: pretzel buns. Zagat gave this a VERY high rating of 26/30.  I wouldn't go that far.  I'd say it's more of a 22.  So I'm not going to say it's the best restaurant in Chicago, far from it.  But it was really enjoyable, and gotta say, HUGE PROPS for creativity.  I really value a place that will offer innovation on its menu.  And I gotta say, a burger place that can satisfy a vegetarian (not a vegan, sorry my friends) really deserves some credit.

I got the kumas burger but had to take the fried egg off because it was sunny side up more or less, but understand most people enjoy eggs that way. I just happen to be the exception. The kumas burger also comes with bacon and cheddar. The roll is of the pretzel variety and is not too overpowering like some pretzel rolls can be. The taste of the pretzel roll was delightful and noticeable, but didn't overpower the burger. The bacon was delicious and crispy and the cheddar was good too. The all star of course was the burger patty. It was a great cut of meat, well seasoned, and very flavorful. The meat was actually surprisingly a very thick cut. Waffle fries came along with that were fine, but they could have been horrible and this place still would be worth the 4 stars I gave it.

When we came back, the waiter was quite rude saying we should have waited outside because she called us and we were not there. I'm not sure who's fault was it, because I was quoted 1 hour and I came back before the hour. Why would I want to wait outside in the scorching heat for an hour? But point is, we still got the table.  We got several types of burgers. I got the iron maiden with the chorizo sausage and my friends got the slayer and something else. Everything was good. The burgers takes awhile to cook so we sipped on some beers and mingled for a bit. Man, do these burgers come with an entrance!  2inch thick burger on pretzel roll! Say no more!... It's time to devour thee!...  I did feel a little gipped with my iron maiden; no lettuce, onions, cheese, any condiments like a burger should. It felt a little naked. Next time, I'll pick a more condiment packed burger.  ""Till' next time Kuma"" +1 Hour wait = ""I'll be back"" P.s. Waiters weren't that bad, they seemed pretty nice.

2010-06-26,5.0,"I was working around here one day and started talking about how much I loved Hot Doug's and how excited I was that it was so close by so I could stop and get one with my mom. I was immediately told if I truly wanted something I'd never forget I should go to Kuma's Corner and get a burger. I was excited to try something new but I didn't believe I'd find the ""best"" burger...and boy was I wrong. My mom and I got here at around 4:30 and didn't have to wait even a second to be seated. We were lucky because by the time we finished our meal there was a huge crowd near the door waiting to be seated.  I had the YOB.  I took one bite and my mouth melted.  I was so focused on my burger that I didn't talk, I just ate. I didn't want to take my mind off it from silly conversation. I wanted to relish this moment and keep my senses focused on the burger. The flavors blended so well and the pretzel bun is the cherry on top. The waffle fries are also some of the best in town. If you are ever in Chicago I strongly suggest you remember to come here for a burger. It will be your favorite burger. If you're not into the whole loud music, tattoo, biker bar feel do not be warded off. Eat here. You will dream about your burger. I know I do.",0.9895,0.794,0.179,0.028,0.641456228956229

I salivate at the thought of having a Pantera or Plague Bringer in my mouth, which are my two favorites! One day I'll try their sandwiches or macaroni (which I hear is great) but for now, I'm content with biting into their juicy burgers.  Price is good. The music is never loud [enough] and I've had no problems in having conversations. Wait is fine considering the size of the place. If you don't like standing... sit at the bar, have a beer and relax.

2010-06-25,5.0,"I was in Chicago by myself on a business trip staying on Michigan Ave. - definitely a departure from my usual type of hang out. I am from Oakland, CA. East Oakland to be exact. My part of town has a certain je ne sais quoi, shall we say, which left me itching to get away from the Dockers and striped shirts swarming me downtown and find my own kind. Fortunately, a friend of mine hipped me to this place, and for that I will be forever grateful.  I knew I found the place of my dreams when I walked in to hear the melodious dulcet tones of one of my favorite Oakland metal bands, High on Fire. When I saw they had a burger named in their honor on the menu, well, all my homesickness was instantly gone.  It was crowded as all get out on a Wednesday night, so I got a beer and patiently tried to jockey for a seat at the bar. The hostess took pity on the lonely looking dorky girl haunting the doorway and managed to wrangle a seat for me right away (was it pity, or maybe she just didn't want me scaring away potential customers?)  Anywho, as soon as I sat down the bartender made sure I was taken care of with a shot of Buffalo Trace bourbon and a PBR back. I ordered the High on Fire burger with the house made chips and enjoyed a lively conversation with the bartenders and the couple next to me. (Can I just say that I LOVE Chicago people?! So friendly!)  When my burger came, I was completely overwhelmed. Here was a perfectly broiled medium rare hunk of meat topped with fists full of prosciutto, two rings of grilled pineapple, and a happy ending of Sriracha sauce, all piled on a substantial and glossy pretzel roll. Serious food porn and f-ing delicious. I had to pack half of it to go, and even though I didn't have a fridge in my hotel room, there was no way I was going to say goodbye to the other half of my new found love.  I had a nice conversation with a gentleman next to me at the bar, who happened to hail originally from Detroit. I mentioned to him that although I have never been to Detroit, I have a weird fascination with the city and think it would be a place that I would love. We agreed that it had a lot in common with Oakland, another city no one visits, but everyone loves to hate.  Even though I was stuffed fatter than a turducken, my new friend insisted that I try some of his macaroni and cheese, telling me I might never get the chance to come back again so why not just try a bite? The thought of a mac n cheese roofie crossed my mind for a split second before I decided it was worth the risk. And boy was it. Even if I was left for dead somewhere in the bowels of the meatpacking district, it would have all been worth it. The giant plate of macaroni (probably a good 5 lbs of it) was creamy, smokey, piping hot, and had that perfectly browned golden crust that is the heroine (and by that, I mean the drug!) of mac n cheese.  When I was ready to leave, the bartender gave me a key chain as a souvenir of my awesome dinner. I had a great time, met some super nice and generous people, had one of the best burgers of my life, and did not get roofied. And that leftover half of my burger? No need for the hotel fridge because it did not last through the night. Burp. The end.",0.9974,0.766,0.174,0.06,0.5485330031920941

We ordered the mac and cheese with sun dried tomatoes and carmelized onions. It was a HUGE serving (seriously could have STUFFED 6 people and there were 3 of us), we barely made a dent in the plate of it but it was amazing.  I got a Lair Of The Minotaur burger- caramelized onions, pancetta, brie, bourbon soaked pears. Unique, gigantic and awesome. And since I clearly am watching my weight I got it with a salad, which I did not touch. Well done, me.

2010-06-25,4.0,"The BEST burger I've ever had! Last night (Thursday) a small group of us ate here. We arrived at about 5:15, and only had a short wait; I've heard the wait is much much longer a little later.  We were seated outside, which was fantastic since the weather was perfect. The server was attentive, and fun. She knew just what to bring us from the beer menu. We told her what we normally drink, and she brought us a comparable beer. I said Bass Ale, and she brought me a 'Good JuJu'. It was fantastic! Someone else said they liked Stella, and she brought a 'Left Hand Sawtooth Ale'. This was so much fun!  The music was not too loud outside, which made it easy to converse with my group.  Now for the important part... the Led Zeppelin Burger was fantastic! It was a thick burger, with a thin layer of pulled pork, which added a little zing, with cheddar and bacon. Most people order waffle fries with their meal, but since I'm watching my weight, ordered a salad instead (your choice). The vinaigrette dressing on the salad was outstanding! It was a little sweet, but light. Soooo delish! I did try the waffle fries, and if you do order them, you will not be disappointed.  I did see a couple with a baby get seated outside, but in my opinion, this is not a place to bring your kids. Too loud, and racy pics up inside. (Just my opinion.) The only negative would be the small size of this place, which usually makes for a long wait for the masses of people in there.

I surprisingly just realized that I haven't posted a review on Kuma's.  I was probably thinking that they didn't need one because they already have over 1500 (which is about how many people are probably in line right now over there).  Regardless, I feel it my obligation warn the world of the awesomeness that is Kuma's Corner.  Indeed, I did say warn, and this is because once you experience it, you realize that there's just not enough Kuma's to go around.  Over about a three month period, I asked at every visit (about 1 per week) if they had any shirts in stock.  Nope.  I eventually got one, though it was not one of the cool cover art ones.  Their kitchen is also so small in order to keep the wait down during patio season, they have to stop taking carry out orders (which means I can't grab Kuma's on my lunch breaks). :(  Despite these obstacles, I would brave (and I have braved) rain, snow, alligators, and the armageddon of 2012 to get my Kuma's fix.  It's my favorite place to eat anywhere, I mean anywhere. Likes:  MEAT!  Try the Mastadon, and you'll never crave a different burger again (fried onion strings, bacon, & tangy bbq sauce).  I love the hot tattooed up chicks tending the bar & tables.  The decor is badass, from the half naked dominatrix chicks to the little bear cub with blood all over his cute little face, thinking ""MEAT!""  There's the metal, the website's hilariousness (the bio of the bear mascot is my favorite), and the packed house environment, not to mention all the other little things that make the place great.  As an amazing note, the burgers all include fries and run about $10-12. Dislikes:  Somehow, magically, perhaps through sorcery, increase the kitchen size so that I can get my Kuma's fix on my lunch break!  That, and get some more shirts in stock!  Oh yeah, and the wait sucks, but if you eat the bar it's not that bad.

I guess I should have prefaced this with: I'm a vegetarian. I went on this journey mainly to be in good company and also to have the privilege to say, ""I've tried/been to Kumas Corner"".  Our wait was about an hour, and fortunately the weather was nice outside so we didn't have to be stuffed inside waiting. The hostess and our waitress were great. Very helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly. Also, she was constantly filling my water glass, which is a big plus in my book.  We ordered mac and cheese with broccoli and sun dried tomatoes. Unfortunately, I wasn't the biggest fan. I thought the taste was a bit too smokey..or lacking in that genuine mac and cheese taste. It was still edible, and I did keep going back to eat it, but it's not something I think I'll be craving. Plus, I love sriracha sauce and mac and cheese, so that made it great for me.  So for the vegetarians, I ordered the Motorhead with a garden patty. Unfortunately, the garden patty tasted and had the texture of cardboard. But, I can't blame them. They're not a vegetarian restaurant, and they were kind enough to have a garden patty, so I must give them kudos. Another upsetting factor was the goat cheese on the Motorhead. I couldn't really taste it! and there was so much on it!  For meat eaters, all my friends agreed that the meat quality was amazing. Although not all agreed on the quality of the burger, it was unanimous that the meat was delectable.  We were dumb enough to order a burger each (and all of us were girls). We took 4-5 bites each and had to take the rest home. I suggest sharing, unless you want leftovers or you have a hefty stomach.  The atmosphere..was just how everyone else describes it.

2010-06-22,1.0,"I would like to give this place a good review, but I cannot after the way we were treated last Sunday. I knew it would be busy - I'm okay with that.  What I didn't know is that I would be treated like I was a piece of used toilet paper attached to someone's shoe. Hey, I've been to places (The Wiener's Circle comes to mind) where you are treated rudely by the staff.  And if that's the shtick, so be it.  But when it becomes easier to unlock Pandora's Box that it is to seat five people for a burger and a beer, my good-natured understanding goes south. Case in point - there were five of us, and we waited almost 1 1/2 hours to be seated (like I said, I was prepared for that).  The hostess (who acted like she would rather see my intestines lying in a heap on the floor that to do her job and seat us) told us that they could seat us outside, but we had to sit 3 at one table and 2 to another. Okay, not the end of the world, I thought perhaps the tables were small and she was making an attempt to accommodate us (it was deafeningly loud inside anyway, and we like to talk over a meal). We get outside, and I see that the tables would easily seat five people.  I inquired as to why we couldn't be seated together, and the testy hostess said ""I don't make the rules,"" tossed our menus down on the table and left. The kicker?  Our other two friends were seated on the other end of the patio - far enough that we would have to shout over the two groups of people sitting between us to be heard.  After a moment or so the table next to theirs opened up, so we stood up and moved next to them.  No problem, right? WRONG!  The heavily tattooed hostess said ""I'm sorry, you can't sit here because this is another waiter's section.""  I asked if she could ask the withers to switch tables, and she said ""You'll have to ask her."" I then asked her if it could be any more difficult to seat a party of five for burgers and beer, and she exhaled loudly and reiterated ""I don't make the rules"" and left. My friends were starving, so my wife and I agreed to leave and let them eat.  My buddy told me that after we left the same snotty hostess gave some guy in a wheelchair trouble about sitting outside.   I've worked in the food business long enough to know that this is unacceptable.  My friends and I all used to wait tables, and we're willing to wait hours to pay $20 for a burger and a beer.  Hell the way we drink we would have probably run up a $200 tab, with a healthy tip to boot. I guess some places get so popular that they believe they are above needing to service the customer, and at Kuma's this appears to be the case.  I hope that they realize that once the novelty of loud heavy metal and calorie-laden dishes wears off, they could face some problems.",0.8013,0.813,0.101,0.086,0.4324900793650793

I think I need to accept Chicago food for what it is, comfort food.  Had a friend visiting this past weekend so decided to check this place out. Definitely committed one of the seven sins (gluttony) at this place.  We started off with the P.E.I. Mussels which was the typical mussel appetizer dish you order at seafood restaurants with the garlic and white wine sauce. You wouldn't expect a burger joint to have good mussels but we ordered it anyway. My god, these mussels were delicious. They were super fresh, I want to go out on a limb and say fresher than the ones I had in SF. The garlic/wine sauce should really be called broth because I literally wanted to take the serving bowl and slurp up the entire thing. Thank god, they provided bread to soak up all the garlicky goodness so I could keep some of my dignity. Next, I had the Plague Bringer, which is pretty much all the crap I love thrown into a burger: garlic, hot sauce, cheese, and then more jalapenos. mmmmm. My only regret was that I should have ordered a fried egg, but was too chinese (I can say this because I'm chinese) to pay $2 for an extra topping. I expected the pretzel bun to be overwhelming and salty but it actually tasted like a normal bun. Actually, what surprised me the most about the burger was that the beef patty had a ton of flavor. I'm used to the patty riding the coattails of the extras but the beef patty was delicious by itself. Another plus about my burger was that it came with fried goodies in the shape of waffle fries. These fries were amazing. They were perfectly seasoned and crispy as hell.  If I wasn't so concerned about getting a heart attack I would be a regular here!

A big, big piece of meat but not overwhelming. The pretzel roll is *perfect*. Not too much bread. And the toppings! I had the Plague Bringer, with sliced jalapenos blended beautifully among a bevy of ingredients too numerous to recall. So, so good. We also had the waffle fries with bleu cheese and bacon. Genius. Utterly satisfying. The other two people in my party were equally pleased with their burgers and the exquisite and unusual beers. A note about the the service, atmosphere and the wait. We went on a rainy Tuesday a little after 7:00 and waited about 45 minutes, quite happily, I might add, once we got our delicious beers. The music was louder and more intense than I've ever experienced in a restaurant, but we came with a relaxed attitude, went with the flow, and were rewarded by  a memorable and fun experience. The service, from the hostess to our servers, was friendly. Warm, even.  I think that in order to enjoy Kuma's, you need to realize that the wait is going to be a roll of the dice, so try to relax, get a beer, and enjoy it with good friends. And bring some ear plugs!

I'm not gonna go on this whole bs spiel about whether I was completely impressed, blown away, or had a burger-life changing experience. I went there to eat, not compare my eating experience to all the ones before me. Eat, is what I did. The Service: Great. I think people project big time with this whole the staff is pretentious or thinks they are better than you cause they have tatts. To the people who say that. . . YOU must think they are better than you because they ARE so frickin cool with their tatts and so on. Stop living in denial and maybe you'll stop being a little bitch about nothing all the time. :-) The Burgers: Were good. Yep, good. Not fantastic, not bad, not mediocre, but good. Nice and comfortably nestled in the middle kinda, AND THAT'S OK! I don't need to always eat awesome, dagnabit.  I got one of the newer burgers, the Baroness; Chimichurri, Fire Roasted Corn Salsa with Bacon and Toasted Red Peppers, Green Beans and Grated Asiago Cheese. My dinner companion punked out and played it safe with the Nuerosis; Cheddar, Swiss, Sautéed Mushrooms, Caramelized Onions, Horseradish Mayo.  They both met our approval with no disappointments.  Unlike Dinky Meat Krumpets (DMK), your burger comes with a choice, read it ""choice"", of sides. I like it when I get choices. I got a nice side Ceasar salad and he got waffle fries. They also have real hard cider, not wine masquerading as hard cider. I felt the meal was definitely worth the price.  Changes I'd Make If I Could: I'd like a choice of bun as well. The pretzel roll isn't bad, but just isn't a universal bun for all burgers. My burger would have excelled with a different bun. I would have also liked it if a side version of the mac & cheese could be a choice with your burger. We wanted to try it, but with the burger, side it comes with and drink, we didn't have room.  I don't see myself getting a hankering for Kuma's, but I'd definitely go back. But during the day on a weekday like I did this time.

First the non-food stuff:We arrive and are quoted a 30 minute wait.  Didn't really keep track but that was about accurate.  Music was loud and metallic.  Not my cup of tea, but it's part of the package, I guess.  Service was excellent. Now the apps: For some reason us three thought it would be good to split two giant apps.  First, pulled pork fries with barbecue sauce and Jack cheese - a dangerously blissful combination.  Then some mac and cheese with andouille and bacon.  Part of me wishes me we held back on the pork, but the true side of me enjoyed the chunks of salty meat found within the rich sauce. Main event time: I ordered a new addition, the Brujeria: cream cheese and chorizo stuffed jalapeno popper, cheddar cheese and charred tomato salsa.  Now after those apps, I thought I was done.  The three of us didn't even get halfway into the fries or macaroni - I figured one bite and I'd be done (which is what happened to one of us).  So I took my first bite. Oh.  My.  Goodness.  The savory salsa, the sharp cheese, and the burst of flavor from the poppers...my one bite became 2/3rds of the (giant) burger.  Still, after splitting leftovers, I had enough delicious food for the entire next day.

The tone was set and my brunch date and I were able to enter through the front door without incident. We timed our visit to coincide with the ebb of the early brunch crowd as it gave way to the lazy Sunday afternoon crowd. We also planned to sit at the bar since there's no waiting involved. Once in and situated (our ears had to adjust to the high-decibel levels of the pulsating metal riffs and drum solos being belted out of the speakers), we were warmly greeted by the bartender, who immediately took our drink order (2 bloodies & 2 waters) and quickly  returned  with our beverages. The bloody mix was excellent and had just the right levels of spiciness and booziness to put a smile on my face. One thing I didn't quite get was the grated cheese. I initially thought it was horseradish, but then realized it was cheese. The thing about it was that it kept on clogging my straw, so I had to ditch the damn straw altogether. I'll have to say that it takes a minute to appreciate the decor of Kuma's as it's a bit of an ecclectic mix of wood carvings portraying bears (realistic and mythical all at once) as well as art for sale on the eastern wall, as well as some bits of Americana sprinkled throughout (the ""Hippies..."" sign, for instance).  So, on to the menu: It's pretty well-rounded with a few salads and apps ranging from chili to mussels.  They also offer a BYO mac & cheese which I will have to go back for at some point. Kuma's also features a few different sandwich offerings, but we were not there to mess around. We were there for bloodlust. And bloodlust we got because Kuma's really does have the best burgers.  The wide variety of heavy-metal inspired burgers, with names like ""Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Slayer and Megadeth"" are equal parts mouth-watering and intimidating. The burgers are available with your choice of 10oz. beef patty, chicken breast, chicken tenders or garden burger and are served on a pretzel bun which is flat-out perfect. I opted for the ""Neurosis,"" consisting of Cheddar, Swiss, Sautéed Mushrooms, Caramelized Onions, Horseradish Mayo and my brunch companion chose the ""Lair of the Minotaur,"" which had Caramelized Onions, Pancetta, Brie, Bourbon Soaked Pears.  Don't try to eat the whole thing unless you have a portable defribillator and a stretcher and/or wheelchair... The food takes a little while because (as the website and menu will mention) the kitchen is a bit on the tiny side at only 16'x6.' But it's well worth the wait and is nicely presented (for burgers & fries anyways). The food was really good and the burgers were very well seasoned and very juicy. I actually wasn't  in as bad a food coma as I had planned for, so that was a plus.  I'll definitely go back to try the chili and the mac & cheese, but for the sake of my cholesterol levels (and my checking account balance), I'll have to space my subsequent visits out over a few months...",0.995,0.853,0.122,0.025,0.45190476190476203

The burgers are definitely delicious, certainly one of the best in the city. Was my mind utterly blown away? Not really. My two other dining companions came to the same conclusion. But the Mac 'n Cheese is to DIE for. The best I've ever had. I didn't know Mac 'n Cheese could taste this good. For me and my friends, it outshined the burgers.

Macaroni and cheese (with prosciutto and sun-dried tomatoes), calamari, and a burger piled with goat cheese is enough to send anyone over the top.

There are a few things that should be mentioned though: it's true, waiting sucks, and if your whole party isn't there by the time your name is called--you lose your table. I was also a bit disappointed with their bar selection; I tried ordering 2 or 3 different beers (mmm...delicious stouts! IPAs!) and kept getting told they stopped carrying those beers. Also, I know this is just a personal preference, but I'm not so into metal--consequently, I wasn't diggin' the music selection. Complaints aside, the food really is great.

We had a party of 8 and got seated separately because of their small space. We didn't mind, but if you're planning on having a big group and you want to sit together, this may not be the place.   Our waitress was Evil Eve. Well, it was actually Eve, but I saw on the receipt that I was served by Evil E. She was awesome! For a place that was incredibly crowded with still a wait out the door, she was very attentive and came back right away with whatever we requested. She also always had a smile on her face and didn't seem put off by the heat and squeeze spaces. Because of the compact space, Kuma's dining room gets pretty hot. The food was excellent, as always. We had the mac n cheese with bacon and andoulle sausage. 5 of us shared this, and I was a little full. It is creamy and packed with flavor, and they don't skimp on the toppings.  I ordered the Insect Warfare, which I cannot begin to describe the monstrosity that it was, but it was better-than-you know what delicious! 1 complaint...the bottled beer was only luke cold. I didn't enjoy that since I ordered IPAs, and they suck when they are not ice cold. I thought the first would be a fluke, but the 2nd one was luke cold as well.  You do need to be patient when you're here, so expect the long wait and don't be so demanding on the wait staff.

Normally, when you sit at a bar and your beer is empty (I was on my first beer of the day!) a bartender asks if you want another one. She did do that, FOR EVERYONE ELSE. Little old not white me felt a bit left out. It wasn't until a black bartender came on shift did I even get a bit of attention. Thank you my non-white brother. He came by and very politely asked if I wanted another beer. I was done with my burger by then (Gene and Jude's is better BTW) so I declined. After seeing that the ""black guy"" had no issue and was just nice to me, and I'm not a scary guy, the bartender came by, with guilt on face, to ask if I wanted another beer. Nothing like racist guilt.  For the Hostess. If all you have for me is ""no"" when I make a reasonable request, don't spend the next 30 minutes constantly staring at me.

They also have waffle fries, which most establishments overlook for regular shoestring.

We aren't really metal-heads in the truest form; I kinda grew out of the phase after middle school, moved on to Classic Rock, then Hip Hop, and now Canadian Indie Rock.

Blaring death metal and all, I want to be impressed by this burger, motorheads! A little tip: Find a couple seats at the bar, or else you'll be like the party of three that cut in front of me to put their names on the list while I glared at them and the hostess, and then an hour later I was chowing down in their gaze, contorting and moaning in ecstasy. They were glaring back, while giardiniera mayo was smothered all over my face.  The wait: Yes, it's going to take 45 minutes to get a burger from when you order. Why???? you ask....because it's huge! If it didn't take 45 minutes, it wouldn't be cooked all the way through. Shut up, be patient, and bring some company you can talk to in the meantime.  The Beer: I don't think they carry any crappy name brand. No light beers here. Only real beer need apply, so if you were hoping for Amstel, you will need to leave and go back to Wrigleyville where you belong.

I dunno, is there a better burger somewhere in this universe? Maybe not. This little joint on Belmont between Sacramento and California may be the best that there is...anywhere.

I had a tiny snack before coming and downed 3 cokes before our food arrived so I was sadly too full to finish the meal. good thing they didn't have the chicago dog burger. would i come back? if it involved a trip to David's Bridal with my friend, in a heartbeat.",0.9141,0.899,0.075,0.026,0.4813333333333334

Sad for the old regulars like me (but great for Kuma's), Diner's Drive In's and Dives and Check Please pretty much killed the experience I used to enjoy when coming here.

Despite this minor annoyance, I love Kuma's.  For someone who rarely, if ever, eats red meat, Kuma's is always an exception. I love the Pantera and Mastadon...

Last night was my first time and I'm already looking forward to the next time I can go.  Let's start with logistics. Small, but not uncomfortable. There were 5 of us, but we managed to squeeze in without sitting on each other's laps. The music is a little loud, but it's part of Kuma's identity, so learn to deal with it. I love the variety of beers...lots of Three Floyd's and other unique choices. I had the Allagash White, which is mild in comparison to some of the others, but is one of my faves.  We gorged on appetizers, which was a mistake because of the size of the burgers to come, but oh so delicious and worth every bite. Jalapeno Poppers - freshly stuffed and battered goodness, served with a sweet and spicy jam sauce BBQ Pork fries - an ample portion of some of the best bbq pork I've had in the city piled high over waffle fries and melted jack cheese Fried calamari - more than enough for a few people to share, lightly battered and fried perfectly with little surprises liked fried peppers and onions, served with lemon aioli (so fatty, but so good, and if you're at Kuma's you've already abandoned any diet for the day) For the main course, I had the Iron Maiden burger (avocado, pepper-jack cheese, chipotle mayo & cherry peppers) of course on a pretzel bread bun. I got homemade chips rather than waffle fries and I wasn't disappointed. It was way too much for me to finish, but one of the guys did clean his plate! All of the burgers come just like they're described on the menu, no surprises. To top it all off, we got great service.

2010-05-13,5.0,"Great place! I am a huge fan of burgers and had heard from a few people that they have the best so I thought I would try it out. Everyone was right. The burgers are huge, 10-ounces I believe, and are served on delicious pretzel buns. You should probably order one doneness less than normal as it seems they do slightly overcook them but never are they dry and charred. In my opinion the toppings are what make the burgers, they have normal toppings, like cheddar and bacon but also some crazy stuff like a panko crusted goat cheese medallion with creme fraiche and salsa. Looking throught the menu will make you want to try so many different burgers and it is hard to decide. If you are feeling really hungry you can start with their fantastic ""build your own"" mac and cheese. There is a bunch of different ingredients you can have them toss in it for you but beware as it is a huge serving. I usually have them put it in a container to take home after eating not too much of it so I have room for the huge burger. Now I also enjoy having a good beer with my burgers and they definitely do not disappoint there either. The beer list is not huge but they do seem to have a regularly changing list of beers generally not found most places, things like delirium or three floyds. Plan on spending at least $10 for a burger alone, which is really not bad for the quality. If you want to sit at a table plan on spending a long time waiting, for this reason I don't think its really a good idea to come with any more than 3 other people. If you come by yourself or just one other person you can usually sit at the bar quickly with no problem where you can also order food.",0.9932,0.78,0.181,0.039,0.5438576007326007

I ordered the famous Kuma burger that had cheddar, bacon and a fried egg.  I'm a sucker for an egg on my burger.  I asked for my burger medium rare...it came to me more on the medium side, but was still very good.  I wish they had different sizes of burgers to order because I can't eat a half-pound burger in one sitting...and burgers don't really re-heat well.   The person I went with ordered the Mastodon.  I didn't even give that one a try.  It was too giant and way too messy.  He seemed to enjoy it though. We both loved the waffle cut fries that were perfectly seasoned.  Again, though, I didn't need (or want) that many fries.   I loved the menu, though.  The names were fun.  I wanted to try other things from the menu, but couldn't justify anything other than a burger since it was the first time I had come.  I may go with the pig destroyer on my next trip.   What I didn't like were some of the customers...some people had that 'oh-I'm-so-cool-because-I'm-at-Kumas-and-I-knew-about-this-place-before-you-did' attitude.  Eh, whatever...they amused and annoyed me at the same time.

Kuma's did not really bring out the importance of the egg on their burger.  Regardless, the burger was really tasty with the beef patty being very flavorful.  Nevertheless, it was not one of the ""BEST"" burgers I've had in Chicago.  Therefore, I made a comment to my friend as we finished dining, that I can not imagine having to wait (from what I've heard is a LOOONG wait) for this place.   My second experience at Kuma's was for dinner.  We went there at 6pm (already expecting a long wait) with 4 of my friends.  We knew this was going to be a long wait as the dining area only offered 2 tables that served parties greater than 4.  We ended up waiting close to 2.5 hours with us finally getting seated a little before 8:30.  Everyone was starving and was ready to order.  We got our food and I ended up ordering the Neurosis (a burger which was topped with Horse Radish mayo).  This burger was probably the best burgers I have ever biten into.  The mayo and the juices from the medium cooked beef patty was the perfect mix.  We also ended up ordering the Mac & Cheese which was phenomenal.   But here's the deal breaker.  Although everyone who dined with me that night agreed the food was good, it was also unanimous where we did not know if the food was actually really good because it was good, or because we were just so hungry from the long wait that they could have served us burgers that they ordered from burgerking and we would have still licked our fingers.   The wait that night made me never want to go back there again.  Along with the long wait, the place is so small that you feel like you're sitting in a cramped jail cell with 500 inmates.  The music was unreasonably loud which did not help the steam from the kitchern already because everyone was basically screaming at each other as if we were communicating at a Rage against the Machine Concert.   The food here is not bad.  But I would only advise people going there for lunch to hopefully wait less than 30 minutes.  DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT TRYING TO GO THERE WITH MORE THAN 4 PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU WILL WISH YOU WERE AT THE DMV.",0.991,0.866,0.109,0.025,0.4372685185185185

We visited you on a freezing day and luckily didn't have to endure a long wait and ordered Lair of the Minotaur (hello bourbon soaked pears) & Neurosis (with fried egg). Minotaur, you were not quite as epic as my expectations believed you to be- you were a bit dry even though I ordered medium and stingy with your bourbon pear slices. Neurosis, you were surprisingly delightful- still a bit dry but the horseradish mayo and mushrooms were tasty.  About half of the fries and a half burger came home with us, the portions are quite generous. The music level in Kuma's? a little overly generous in decibels.  All in all, thanks for a good time Kuma's. You give great variety with your menu but focus a lot on quantity over quality.

So, we decided to wait, but about 35 minutes into the wait, the hostess came to ask if we would like to sit at the bar. We jumped at the opportunity as my hubby was getting real hungry. It turned out great. We were seated real close to the kitchen where we were able to see the cooks in action with all the burger flipping and pans tossing.

I chose Good Friday both times, hoping the wait time would be shorter minus some non-meat eating Catholics.  It worked last year, this year it did not.  An hour and a half and an Allagash appetizer later, we were seated. This time I tried the famous Kuma burger complete with sunny side up egg, cheddar and bacon. It was huge, but Kumas does right by their burgers. Our mac & cheese of choice included prosciutto, peas and bacon. I think the mac & cheese is almost as much of a draw to me as the burger. The age old question though, is still, is it worth the wait?  While I have no doubt you can make your own mac & cheese and build your own topping-heavy burger at many other establishments in this city, Kumas is about the experience:  by the time you sit down, sure you have a slight headache induced from not eating in preparation, compounded by the death metal that's been slowly killing your brain for the last 2 hours, but somehow it makes everything taste that much better.

Atmosphere: Young and busy - super busy.  I was prepared for a wait from reading other reviews, but even after experiencing the food, I'm not sure I would be prepared to wait 2 hours for a table on a Thursday night again.  It wasn't quite the hard rock crowd I expected given the name and the reputation, but I felt comfortable... except for the crowd of people waiting for their table around my table.

You are the unfortunate key master who has to deliver the bad news: the wait will be 2 hours. Never fun.  Well their hostesses, from my experience, have decided to give up with smoothing over the wrinkles of long waits. Snappy, unsympathetic, rude is what i experience over the phone and at the door.  (too bad cause the bar tenders and wait staff are usually great!)  Also, they have a (new?) policy of not telling you over the phone what the approximate wait could be. (reason being that the wait times can dramatically shift and folks tend to get mad when they think they will wait an 1/2 hr and end up waiting a 1hr.) I get why you MIGHT want to avoid doing this. However, I expect that a business has an idea of what their flow is like on each give day (take stats for god sakes) and what the actual wait is at the moment. NO instead the person over the phone insists that they DONT EVER give out wait times. (really?)  I give it a stab anyway, i drive my family to the place. We get in the door it is a 3 hr wait. Now why could someone over the phone give me that wait time? It seems pretty obvious that she could have said (really long right now). Its not like it was going to get much better.  I have never had a restaurant tell me they dont give wait times over the phone.

But I finally got to Kuma's a couple nights ago. So, a wide selections of beers. A full compliment of 'concept-burgers,' each with their own unique ingredients and name.  Calamari was well-seasoned and full of flavor and crunchy topping. The mac n cheese was a tad bit short on cheese but had a lot of flavor from the mix of ingredients and spices.

2010-03-14,4.0,"When it comes to burgers I'm hard to please and while I wouldn't rate Kuma's as my favorite burger spot, they're definitely up there. I think it's mostly because of the creativity of their burgers. Their patties are very meaty and you can taste the quality although I personally struggle with eating it... I do not like the thick pretzel bun and wish they had something softer, but I suppose they need it to withstand the meaty patty. I like how every month they create a new burger such as the sleep burger during November! My favorites include Lair of the Minotaur, Led Zeppelin, their pulled pork fries and make-your-own mac n cheese. They also have a very good selection of beers including a lot of stuff I've never heard of. If you live in Chicago and haven't tried Kuma's there's something wrong with you. Go now!

2010-03-13,5.0,"I really don't understand people complaining about waiting. It's freaking DELICIOUS, of course you have to wait in line!  Blame the hundreds of new people who up and decided to flood the place after a few articles in TOC, cause we never had to wait that long before about 18 months ago...I accept it as the price of admission and get a drink. I also don't know many really truly good places to eat that you can walk in and the place is empty. That's usually a sign to head the other direction. So stop complaining about the long wait...just go earlier or go somewhere that the food is inferior and noone wants to go. So let's focus on what is important, their OMG burgers!  Their burgers cannot be beat! At least not by any place I've tried yet, though it's hard to go anywhere else when I want a great burger with extra anger and heavy metal on the side :)  Everything is good, literally, EVERYTHING.  Between us we've tried a good number of the burgers, chicken sandwiches, I even tried the vegetarian burger.  ALL.GOOD! It's loud, and you often have to wait an hour, sometimes 2 to get seated.  So if you are super hungry get there before 6:30pm during the week, or get there REALLY late.  Between Yelp, TOC and various other local challenges, this place got all the attention and praise it deserves, so now it's that much harder to get in. Recently started getting the Mac n Cheese appetizer and man is it good.  We got the andouille sausage and red pepper and it was the best mac n cheese I've had in a LONG time. I'm partial to the Megadeath burger and my hubby like to go traditional with the Kuma burger with the egg on it. We've never had any waitress, server or hostess that was condescending or snarky in a way we didn't find completely appropriate and hilarious.  A few people have complained, I don't know maybe they are used to Red Robin.  I suppose it is possible that the short period after their fame exploded a few people got extra attitude with their burgers but we've been there planty of times, and had different waitresses and NEVER had a complaint.  We usually really end up liking our waitresses ::shrugs:: Great beer list, greatly expanded in the last year or two.  Decent bar selections, but it's so loud and crowded that once again, if you're looking for fast service and a nice quiet chat, this is NOT your place. Lastly, it's NOT a family place so please stop dragging in strollers and small children that complain and freak out from the noise and punked out waitresses.",0.9783,0.822,0.121,0.056,0.4507575757575758

I also liked the fact that you can put in different ingredients to enhance your Mac n' Cheese experience.  As for the burgers.. I've tried most of them.. and have never been unhappy.  The only downside to their food is their massive portions.. but I guess it's always better to get more and take it home than leave still starving,0.9264,0.75,0.158,0.092,0.5858823529411765

Having said that, I was a total skeptic, having lived in Chicago all my life, i thought i had the best burger already, with hackneys, J Alexanders ive loved for years, or rockit, which was very good, moody's pub rarely ever has disappointed, but Kumas? I mean they take the burger to an artform, expand on it, and make you extremely happy to have waited for however long you've waited to try possibly the best burger you will ever have, at a reasonable price Its hard to explain the first taste, i dont like cliches like slice of heaven, or things like that, so i will say that first bite of that burger you just understand what its about, you get the picture, and realize the quality of this burger. i had the Judas Priest burger topped with Bacon, Bleu Cheese Dressing with Apples, Walnuts, and dried cranberries, No condiments are necessary, easily the juiciest burger i've ever had, served on a pretzel bun, the taste emanates from the first bite to the last, the flavor is sweet but also a little tangy, it was mind boggling and put me into a definite food coma, as when we got home at 12 i crashed immediately, while i usually dont sleep til like 3am No complaints about the service, actually under the stressful busy conditions of a saturday night the dude seating people was real cool, and held up some bar seats for my girl and i. Still the wait was an hour and a half, and we talked with some people who had been there for 3 hours still waiting, and that is the drawback to an out of this world burger, you are going to wait. So a -.5 for that. Otherwise, no complaints, good beers like La Fin Du Monde, and other nice selections, while also not expensive, we rolled out of there having spent $35 full as hell and loving what we ate. Waffle fries were just too much, id get the salad if the damn fries weren't so good. Dark ambience inside, music was not too loud, really not obnoxious or anything actually, i enjoyed it, and will be back when i got a couple hours to wait.

2010-03-09,3.0,"I first tried Kuma's while still being a carnivore.  I tried the Clutch and The high on fire.  Both amazing.  The clutch had 4 different cheeses piled about a half inch thick.  I loved the cheesy goodness, and I think it may have been the best burger I have had.  I also love the pretzel buns, but Kuma's isn't the only place with pretzel buns.  On another Kuma's adventure I tried the build your own mac-n-cheese.  So good!  So So good. The downfall of this place is how impossible it is to get in and how rude the hostesses are.  The first time I went we had no problem, it was late summer and the patio was still open so they had extra room.  The next time we had to wait awhile but ended up just jumping in at the bar when someone left.  Two weeks or so ago we tried to take some friends from Detroit who had never been to Chicago and had been advised by many that they ""must try Kuma's"".  Well, we tried.  We didn't think it would be a problem getting in at 8:30pm on a Sunday night.  Very, very, wrong thinking.  We opened up the door and had no where to go, people were practically falling out of the place when the door opened, they were packed in so tightly.  I somehow squeezed in and made it to the hostess who told me there was a 2 hour wait.  Oh dear god no!  I hadn't ate all day, saving up room for Kuma's I couldn't wait 2 hours to be seated and who knows how long to get our food. This past Sunday we had a similar situation.  I was starving after getting out of work, it was late, Kuma's sounded good.  So my boyfriend gave them a call around 9pm, just to see what it was like in there.  The hostess on the phone was super rude to him and wouldn't tell him anything.  He wasn't trying to make a reservation, or even ask a specific time period for the wait, we just wanted to know how busy they were and if we drove all the way over there if we would have any chance of being seated.  She rudely bickered with him a bit until he gave up and said ""ok, thanks, for your help!""

2010-03-04,4.0,"This place can be easily summed up: best burger in Chicago. Each burger is a unique artistic creation of 10 ounces of quality beef. The menu is so fun (plenty if choices in burgers, all named after heavy metal bands) and there is always a new burger of the month to keep things fresh. Try staples like Metallica (bacon, buffalo sauce and blue cheese) or High on Fire (roasted red pepper, grilled pineapple and chili). I've tried probably 10 of these burgers and loved them all. It's a biker bar serving burgers and mac & cheese but is so well done it was on food network!!! Speaking of mac and cheese: this is also gourmet. It's ""make your own"" meaning you pick the ingredients. It's made of several cheeses but isn't the standard restaurant version that's simply cheese with a side of pasta. They don't just add as many possible cheeses as humanly possible and call it gourmet.  Now.....I have only given Kuma's 4 stars because of the long lines. I know they can't control it but it still does suck. Here's my tip on beating the line: get there 20min before opening on a weekend and just have an early lunch. You'll only wait 20 min to be seated and will enjoy the meal quicker. If you're not an early bird, just sit at the bar. This too can be a long haul though.

Both are Disneyland versions of metal/punk bars. Both have the toppings, and good beers. But the Vortex never had wait times of over an hour at any given time. I like their effort as a burger and a wannabe metal joint, but I just can't convince myself to stomach the wait times. Clearly they are ok with that, considering they don't seem to have any intent to expand. That's fine, because most places that expand lose their charm.

Perhaps I just value my time more than most. *When* we do go, we try to squeeze in between 4-5 before the crowd hits. Ideally on a M/T/W, when restaurants in general are slower. There is oftentimes little to no wait at these times. We went at 2 on a Sunday with only a half hour wait once somehow too. That being said, the *Plague Bringer completed me. Perfectly spicy, garlicy, and salty. I've also had the *Motorhead, it was alright, but not balanced or salty enough for me. I am also a huge fan of the *Buffalo Chicken Tenders- the sauce is a bit on the hot side like I love it, and the breading is perfect. I substituted a *salad for fries (not realizing nor being told that it's $2 extra) and it was great- nice house vinaigrette and fresh leaves. I had the *Mac and Cheese before and don't remember it being stand out despite the raves I always hear. My boyfriend, the simplest meat eater in the world, orders a *cheeseburger and though I think that's sinful when there are 15+ gourmet choices, he loves it like a first born.

2010-03-02,5.0,"I first heard about this place on  chicagoburgerproject.blo… and this place was on the top of my list to try. If you decide to do lunch on the weekend be prepared to wait if you aren't 45 minutes early. But anyone who's been to Hot Doug's knows the drill, you have to wait for some of the best food in the city. First trip was decent ordered some kick ass Bloody Marys and the burger of the month for January the Bloodhorse. I will never order a pizza burger without sausage on it again. The Andouille sausage made the burger. I am so very upset that we did not get mac and cheese on our first trip. I can't stop thinking about it. We got bacon and Andouille sausage in it and wow, just wow this place is gonna destroy my palette as i'll never be able to eat mac and cheese without comparing it to this place. Also I've never had their ""chips"" but I am fairly sure that the waffle fries with the homemade ketchup is probably as good as it gets. The server we had was well informed suggesting some great beers that many of us had never heard of before. She also joined in on our heckling of each other and made the experience even that much more enjoyable. I can only hope the metal music and cold weather can keep the non hardcore yuppies away till the patio area opens up and they can serve more people so I don't have to wait as long for some of the best food I've ever had.",0.9863,0.832,0.139,0.029,0.5713675213675213

I ordered medium rare when I should have ordered medium. Hey, usually when I order medium anywhere else I get an overcooked grey thing. (Note: At Kumas, medium is the perfect dark pink, medium rare is blood red and rare must seriously be mooing). So, imagine my surprise when our waitress could NOT have been nicer about taking my burger back. I was even given new toppings, including fresh crispy bacon and a brand spankin' new fried egg, runny yolk and all to coat my burger in happiness. Along with the nice waitress (which goes a long way in my book) it was the BEST burger I have ever had. And listen to the reviewers who rave about the mac and cheese - it's to die for!

2010-02-22,2.0,"Anytime when you are down and you hear about unemployment at 10% or that retail sales are down, buck up and head to Kuma's, you would think that Nasdaq is at 25,000.  The wait did not really bother me per se because well my tuition was paid by people who eat at restaurants; moreover, the tag ""Best Burger in the Midwest"" was chiming through my head. But the one thing that I first noticed was that like internet stocks, the business of Kuma's may be a sophistry. Kuma's is not a very large place. At most it sits 60-80 people including 14 at the bar. I started to think, if Guy Fiere, Food and Wine, Gourmet (alas!!!), the Tribune, the glutton in Man vs. Food, and the Sun-Times did not hype up this place, would it be that busy? Moreover, if it was larger, would we have to wait?  I decided to wait near the bar and examine the beer list. I wish I had the brewer's equivalent of the Rosetta Stone. We were assaulted with terms like ""Purple Haze,"" ""Pumkin,"" ""Bouquet,"" and ""Lychee."" None of which made any sense with beer.  It was trial by fire, I ordered ""Purple Haze,"" because gays are naturally attracted to the color purple. Well, it took me a good 5-10 minutes to wrangle the bartender. I was in a sea of heterosexual men yelling out orders. It was like the floor of the NYSE and I was Maria Bartiromo yelling out ""PUUURRPLE HAZE!"" Kuma's is meant to resemble a bilker's bar, sure there were the requisite picture of nude women drinking blood out of a bat, but it all seemed too synthetic. It was D&G acting as if it was Wrangler. The kitchen is an open-one, but it essentially has the same amount of cooking space in a studio apartment. There is a grill, a salamander, and some prep counters, that is it. While the kitchen sounds simple, it is fitting for its menu, there are fourteen different types of burgers, three-five generic versions of salad (chicken salad, cobb salad, etc), some appetizers, and mac-and cheese. Most of my attention was focused on the burgers because Kuma's is known for them, not the calamari. The burgers range from $10-$14. The one that was shown on Diners, Drive-in's, and Dives is the one served with a fried egg, ""The Kuma Burger."" Since it is so iconic, it is only natural for nobody in my party to order it. I ordered the ""Pantera,"" which was a patty served on top a charred poblano pepper, a slice of bacon and Monterey Jack cheese. With every burger you get the choice of fries or chips. I chose chips, everyone else selected fries. Well we ordered, and we waited.  As I said, the kitchen is small and it took some time for the burgers to come out. I am not sure how much time passed, but I do remember that I went to the bathroom twice. Dear Reader, if you do not wish to contract hepatitis, avoid the bathroom. Thankfully my parents are Chinese and they eat everything; consequently, I have some naturally immunity, or I would be dead. I think I should also talk about the non-existent service. The waitress stopped by twice, and she seemed more concerned with us ordering alcohol then anything else. In fact I noticed that after the burgers were served, the water stopped flowing too.  The burgers came out and my coterie of sexy femme-fatales immediately noted how they could not finish everything and bring leftovers for lunch. Such thoughts did not cross my mind. I cut the burger in half, and noted that it actually took some effort to cut the pretzel bun. I finished the burger in 10 minutes. The chips took me another 5. But here is the thing, the entire experience was a giant ""meh."" The chips were crispy, fresh, piquant and delicious, but was it worth the wait? But the main disappointment was the burger. I had better ones in Chicago. The Twisted Spoke in Wrigglyville (before it closed down for inauspicious reasons) served a much better burger, and MUCH better bacon. I also remembered the bun to be resplendent verging to the point of being orgasmic. Here is the rub, the much vaunted ""Best Burger in the Midwest,"" even fell to burgers I had in Tennessee, California, Florida, and even Louisiana.  But in the totality, the burger at Kuma's was merely competent. The patty was juicy, and it tasted like beef, so it was not overly salted; but the pepper and cheese was absolutely uninspired, it was out of a Mexican menu.  I felt cheated really, and I pondered, if Guy Fiere did not visit, would Kuma's be Kuma's. If he had rolled into the Twisted Spoke, I think it would have deservedly won the plaudits that are currently bestowed on Kuma's. If Food & Wine wrote about my little shack in Louisiana, the lines would be out the door; people would justifiably drive an hour and a half. Like the interior, I felt the burger was a counterfeit. My friends left like they were trying to recover from a carnivorous frenzy. I felt like I had an amuse bouche.",0.997,0.842,0.12,0.038,0.44996756715506714

So, obviously I had to go back and go big.  The next time I went, I waited even longer, the music was even worse, and I ordered something that I never would (and done medium) and it was even BETTER! In my opinion, the Neurosis is the best burger on the menu, followed by the Black Sabbath and the Famous Kuma as a tie.  The whole chipotle peppers on the Dark Throne are kind of unsettling, but after picking them off that burger was also fantastic.   Put your name on the wait list, get some scratch tickets at the market across the street, leave the fries behind and finish the burger!!!  And definitely get a beer, because I'm sure after the wait that you've just endured, you've earned it.

2010-02-11,2.0,"""Samurai Princess"" is a Japanese kung-fu movie where the bad guys torture, kill, and eat their victims.  The bad guy has a chainsaw leg that he swings around, slicing off body parts.  The bad girl has scissors for a leg that she inserts into her opponents' mouths and slices heads off.  Blood sprays everywhere while they slow dance in the red rain. ""Dragon Inn"" is a Chinese kung-fu movie set in ancient China.  At this inn, wonderful dumplings are served, filled with the ground human meat of bad guests.  Heads fly and blood sprays. Why am I talking about this in a review for a burger joint?  Because I watched BOTH of these movies on the bar's plasma tv while I waited for a table at Kuma's Corner.  THREE HOURS. When we arrived on a Friday night around 7pm, we were told it was a two hour wait by the hostess.  Okay, we accepted that, since it was the weekend and reviewers had prepared us for this.  There were two of us, and as we waited in the front, we noticed over time that the crowd waiting with us gradually thinned out as parties of three or four got seated (eventually), even the ones that arrived after us.  I also noticed a few other couples that were still waiting along with us.  I finally realized that because the restaurant has about 8 large tables (4 persons) and only 3 small tables (for 2), larger parties get seated before smaller ones.  It's as if they didn't want to put a couple at a large table for fear of ""wasting"" two seats.  This got me quite annoyed. When we were finally seated, we were sure of what we wanted (we had three hours to study the menu!).  Kuma's Corner has a large variety of burgers (among other things).  The base of every burger features big, thick 10-ounce patties on a pretzel roll bun.  The toppings differentiate each burger, ranging from the simple (Kuma Burger: cheese, fried egg) to the pile-a-bunch-of-stuff-on-it (Slayer). The patties were cooked exactly as ordered, which impressed me given how thick they are.  The pretzel bun is great.  You get a choice of waffle fries or potato chips with your order.  These burger combos range from $10 to $13 or so, not bad prices. All I'll say about the burgers is that they taste great.  Go for the classic, simple styles in order to appreciate them.  Though the food was good, I'm giving three stars simply because of the waiting experience.  If the restaurant is busy and I have to wait, no problem, that's my choice.  But when they start seating people behind me, before me, that's something that really dampens the experience.  Bottom line:  is a Kuma's Corner hamburger good?  Yes.  Is it worth the wait?  Maybe.   I'm glad I went once, but probably will not go again.  I can watch kung-fu movies at home.",0.445,0.876,0.067,0.057,0.5297028031070586

Add metal music to the mix and you've got a winner in my book.  Even most of the burgers are named after Metal bands, for instance, the 'Slayer',  which is 'topped with anger'.  Can't wait to try the Plague Bringer, which is full of everything hot.  Oh, and if you need more hotness, they deliver plenty of bottles of hot sauce to your table.    Don't expect a run of the mill burger here.   Each sandwich is unique. The crowd was mixed and not full of weight lifters.   Hippies and emos beware though, you might be offended by the various signs that aren't exactly welcoming.  (i.e. 'Die Emo Die', 'Hippies Use The Backdoor')    But laugh it off and have a burger here. Whiskey/Bourbon on tap is a bonus, just don't order a Budweiser, Coors, or the like - the bartender yelled at me saying they don't carry those 'crap beers', until I said 'ok, how bout a Pabst', and then he said 'but we do carry that crap beer!'     Only negatives (completely tolerable) are that finding a table to eat during busy times will be tough - it's a small place.   You will leave smelling like a fast food joint for a while - the kitchen is a part of the bar.   But thumbs up to the guys back there who get everything out fast, given their small working environment.

2010-02-09,5.0,"After a long absence I finally made it back down to Chicago for a weekend with my old college pal and his girlfriend this past November.  Being better people than me, they've managed to come to Madison much more often than I make it down to Chicago.  I have no excuse for this, and it is wrong on many levels, but foremost it is not fair to me as I am only cheating myself out of chances to try places like Kuma's.  The experience I had on this particular Sunday afternoon certainly belongs in the Burger Pantheon.  It could not have been a better experience. The night before was a bit of a blur, as we started quaffing the Spotteds I ran across the border around 4 in the afternoon, and I dimly recall finishing my last Dead Guy Ale a good twelve hours later.  Suffice it to say my condition on Sunday morning was less than stellar.  I'd woken up fairly early and nursed several glasses of water while watching SportsCenter with the sound muted, waiting for my friends to wake up.  Once we did get everyone up and running, the suggestion was made to try Kuma's.  I hadn't heard of the place and offered no opinion, but despite concerns about the long wait we decided to give it a shot.  I'm pretty happy that we did. The weather was unseasonably warm that weekend, which made the 45 or so minute wait outside actually enjoyable.  There was a wide assortment of hipsters on display, and I was able to bust out one of my favorite WI jokes: ""Why are there no hipsters in Wisconsin?  We can't fit into skinny jeans.""  I think the wait was somewhat shortened since we arrived just before noon and there was also a Bear's game that day, which is fortunate since I don't believe I'd have handled a 2-3 hour wait well given my condition.  We got the call and were directed to a smallish table near the kitchen area.  I'd been forewarned about the metal on the stereo but atypically the first song I heard was something soft and acoustic.  However every song following was of the face-shredding variety.  I enjoyed the atmosphere and attitude of the place even though my musical tastes are firmly on the punk side of the equation.  Our waitress gave us our menus and brought waters for my friends.  I ordered a Surly Wet on draft, thinking that a bit of the hair 'o the dog wouldn't do me any harm.  The waitress was good enough to alert me to the price ($10) but I'd had this IPA before, and while I'm not a huge Surly fan (no distro in WI), I had no qualms about paying for something of this quality.   It took us a while to decide on our burger order, but I ended up getting the Dark Throne with chips, while my friends opted for the Kuma and the Mastodon.  I sipped on the Surly while our burgers were being prepared, and it seemed like our order came out very quickly as I was only a quarter into my beer upon arrival.  The burger was huge, and I had to cut it in half in order to get my jaw around it.  While I can't definitively say it was the best burger in my life, the Dark Throne definitely charts in the top five.  The roasted chipotle peppers gave it a nice heat, perfectly balanced by the cool of the pico and the savory of the goat cheese.  I tore through the first half in no time flat, then gave a pause to let the burn of the peppers subside.  The chips that came with the burger turned out to be very good in their own right, and I was very happy in my choice of an accompanying beer.  I took the time to really enjoy the second half of the burger, making a point to scoop up the peppers and pico that had fallen out of the first half.  Once it was done I was fully sated, with not a desire in the world.  My hangover was beaten into submission and I was ready to enjoy the remaining hours I had left in Chicago.  Not only was my experience at Kuma's delicious, it was restorative.  There aren't too many burgers I've had that come close.",0.9976,0.773,0.159,0.068,0.4743689508323653

2010-02-09,3.0,"Let me preface this by saying I'm not eating meat or cheese this month, so my review is going to be a little less glowing than most.  My friends' burgers looked and smelled amazing, and the topping combinations are well-thought-out.  Even though I went with the veggie burger version of the Mastodon, though, it was still delectable (pretzel bun, nom, nom, nom!), and carried just the right amount of BBQ sauce & frizzled onions.   The service was great, and my server was really cool with me making so many changes to my burger.  She didn't even bat an eyelash at the fact I was drinking club soda instead of beer, either. Now for the negatives -  1) The music, omg the awful music!  I actually dig metal if I'm driving or out at a dive bar, but it was ear-shattering and coming from right above my table...not cool.  I basically ended up inhaling my burger in an effort to escape the situation. 2) The wait.  Yeah, the food is good, but nothing is worth an hour wait if you still have to pay for it. 3) The hostess, who was more emo than metal.  Stop pouting, and when you're done with that, stop glaring at people.  It's just weird. 4) The crowd.  We waited for an hour to get seated, stuck awkwardly between the bar and the tables.  When we finally were seated, the new crowd of waiting folks hovered awkwardly, inches from our table.  Not at all a comfortable concept for easy digestion. Overall, it was an interesting meal.  Maybe I'm just getting old, but I don't have any desire to visit again.  They have plenty of customers, though, so I doubt I'll be missed.",0.8026,0.79,0.113,0.097,0.5683066933066934

First of all, the wait is really, really, really long. Even on a Wednesday night, expect to wait up to two hours or more to get seated for dinner. I could understand that kind of wait on a weekend, but it's pretty excessive for a weekday. Secondly, the past couple of times I've gone, they have been out of approximately a third of the beers listed on their menu. While I understand they only have a limited amount of every beer available on a given night, I kinda wish the waitress told me or they had it written on the board what they were out of rather than me suggesting like a dozen things. Lastly, the burgers are really unbelievable. My personal favorite is the Iron Maiden. Sometimes they have really good burgers of the month too. In September, they had a kobe beef sloppy joe which you would think would just be a waste of kobe beef, but they obviously cut the kobe with another meat and they made their own sloppy joe sauce instead of just using Manwich.",0.9586,0.84,0.121,0.039,0.5677142857142857

With its long interior, tattooed bar staff, and the best rock and metal tunes playing, I was amazed this gem lay hidden from me for over a year. Expect a wait, this place is very popular. We arrived at 5pm, and booked a table for 8. The staff were very accommodating when we ended up with a group of 12. We were told, we would be sat down by 7:30 pm, we were eating their amazing mac & cheese by 7 pm sharp! In the meantime, we gobbled down some quality beer. In particular, I had Scotty Karate, a 10% ale for $5, and when they run out, the lush waitress recommended the Scottish ale, Skull Splitter to cheer me up. Both were great, and they hit the spot nicely. Did I mention, their amazing mac & cheese? That's right, while you wait for your heavy metal burgers ( expect names such as Pantera, Metallica and Iron Maiden ), you are served mac & cheese, do not miss out on it. Having ordered the Metallica, and wearing their Master of Puppets t-shirt, I have to say that it was the best burger I have had, not just in Chicago, or L.A. or back at home in London. It was the best burger I ever had the pleasure of tasting. The Metallica has blue cheese and their buffalo sauce with two strips of bacon, and the whole package requires a big bite.

Although I can't remember everything that was on my burgers, let me say this. I have never had a burger that tasted better!

OH! And they serve one of my favorite beers! Allagash! YUM  Overall: 1). Best Burger I have EVER HAD! 2). I understand there is usually a wait, if you are like me and hate waiting, go early and on a random weekday.  3). Best Burger EVER! I dont want to eat burgers anywhere else. 4).

Appreciated that they were right, but seriously? 2. My burger (Chipotle/Goat Cheese/Bruschetta/ BURGER) was fantastic.  The fries were OKAY but they kind of tasted like they sat out for a while, which was strange since this place is constantly cranking out food. 3. My boyfriend had the Plague something or other burger.  At the time he liked it, but when he tried mine later he came to the conclusion that his was an assault on his sense of taste (and he smelled like jalapeno for two days, and yes, he bathes.)  His lesson was to go with the less is more on a burger concept. 4. It is really loud but well worth the trip to visit once. Will we go back? Maybe at a really off hour, but otherwise we're going to check out some other places. 5. I understand it is a bar/restaurant, but when I tell a waitress I don't want a drink, maybe I have a reason and she shouldn't make faces at me and give me a giant thumbs down.  Seriously, I spent my drink budget across the street because the wait was so long (go check out Square Bar).

I had the ""Our Famous Burger"" (bacon, cheddar, and fried egg on a pretzel roll), and I thought it was okay. The good:  - I didn't have to wait in line, but that's because two of my awesome friends went and picked them up for the group.  They were gone for about an hour and a half, though. - It was a good burger, basically. The bad:  - After all the raves, I expected explode-in-my-mouth wonder!  Instead, my burger bun was kind of soggy, the burger was not really very interesting at all, the bacon wasn't crisp...I'm willing to concede that 50% of this was probably due to having to be carted home for 20 minutes, but before the Five Guys opened on Clark, I used to cart Five Guys home from Clybourne for 20 minutes and they were always still AMAZING.  So, what gives, Kuma's?  Can't beat a fast food burger? - The fries were undercooked.  Admitted, I love me some overcooked fry (srsly!).  Shoestring + overcooked = HEAVEN.  These were criss-cut (which I also love, since criss-cut = shoestring in basket shape...you know, strips still thin enough to get a really good crispy-to-mushy ratio) and they were undercooked.  Ew.  Uncrispy, kinda soggy, barely golden.  Seriously, I've almost made better fries at home (key word: almost.  I kind of suck at fry-making).

They never brought me silverware and after dropping mayo on my pants and haphazardly trying to split my burger I went inside to grab some, the only problem -- it's behind the bar and no one really cares to try to help you, but will give you the evil eye when you try to get it yourself.  Food- two of the members of our group had their burgers cooked incorrectly, sent back and then brought out hodgepodged versions later. My other friend had cold fries on her plate. Speaking of fries, could they be any more over cooked and salted? At least they're hand made, I guess. I was expecting a bit more at a base price of ~$10/burger Policy- One of the other members in our group came a little late, we had moved to make space for her (she's a petite female) and the hostess came back and apologetically stated that she wasn't able to join us. It was the MOST UNCOMFORTABLE situation I had ever been in. Our friend who never goes out greeting us with a warm smile only to turn to frown. It was really sad and totally put a crimp on our group outing.

In addition the mussels may also be the best I have ever had. The whole scene at Kumas is cool. The music, the movies, the layout all just work so well.

2010-01-22,5.0,"I love this place. A few things for newcomers though.... The 2 hour wait: This is a tiny place. It is a BAR with some tables. The kitchen is small. They are not physically capable of producing food faster to serve you. A wait time is standard for Kuma's, expect it when you go. I don't get people bitching about the wait and then...waiting. Don't want to wait? Go somewhere else, someone will gladly take your place on the seating list.  I personally think the food is worth the wait and im happy to hang out ,drink some delicious beer and wait to sit down.  It's just part of going to Kuma's. Expect it almost any time of day. The more people you try to sit, the longer your wait will be since the tables are not big. If you go later ( after 10pm) it will clear out a little usually. Vegans: This is a burger joint. Heads up, they aren't really catering to your dietary choices. Nothing personal. Vegetarians: They do have a cheese topped garden burger alternative that is delicious. Music: They play metal. It's *really* not that loud...i have never had an issue with not being able to carry on a conversation. People that complain that it's too loud probably just don't like the music, period. If you don't like it, don't go to Kuma's. I have to listen to Q101 bullshit in every other business out there and i don't get pissy about it ( well, i do but i don't get huffy about it to the staff) Waitstaff: I have never had a problem with waitstaff here. They have always been really nice. Be nice to them, they will be nice to you. Whiny customers aren't going to be sucked up to.  Kids: Not really a kid friendly place. It's a bar. With fetish art on the wall.  But hey, they gotta learn at some point... If you have a problem with any of the stuff above, Kuma's might not be the place for you. If so please don't come, I'm tired of seeing the uptight types coming in and expecting their pickiness to be catered to. If you can relax, leave your sense of entitlement at the door and just drink your fucking beer and be ready to wait for good food, you will like this place.

I absolutely freaking love this place!!!  After many failed attempts at parking, waiting and salivating, I finally got my first taste of Kuma's.  My girlfriend and I ventured here after watching some football on Sunday.  It must of been around 5 or 6 (I was extremely drunk and hardly remember), but we were seated in 5 minutes on the patio.  This was due to a rainstorm coming.  Couldn't believe it.  5 minutes!!!  After so many failed attempts, I could barely sit in my seat.  I didn't even need to open the menu because I knew what I was going to get. I had to order the Kuma burger, and I must say it was amazing.  The egg was cooked perfect, the meat was juicy, and the bun had a nice toast on it.  It was perfect what can I say.  My girlfriend had the Motorhead with chicken.  I was more blown away from this!  What a great combination of flavors, the goat cheese, olives, tzatziki, tomato and onion.  This was the perfect sandwich.   The beer list is also out of this world.  I would love to try every one of them.  The only thing holding me back is trying to get in the door! I have to admit, I don't mind the waffle fries at all.  I think they are quite good especially with that ketchup.   After we both finished our plates and paid, we stood up and the rain started to pour.  I looked up and said, ""thank you for whoever organized this so I could get my first taste of Kuma's!""",0.9928,0.798,0.167,0.035,0.6636904761904762

Would I wait an hour and half to try any other burger on their menu? Hell. yes.  So, we went at a very off time in terms of eating a huge burger, but we didn't want to wait too long, so we figured that was our best bet. Turned out, it was good thinking. We arrived and were immediately greeted by a really friendly hostess who took our name and told us the wait was around 30 minutes. Score. Before we arrived, we agreed that we'd wait up to one hour, so that was good news. Lucky for us, 2 seats opened up at the bar, which is first come, first served, and the couple in front of us wanted to wait for a table. The bartender got right to us, and 15-20 minutes later, we were feasting on one of the best burgers I've ever had.  That being said, by the time we were wrapping up our meal, the crowd waiting to get in had grown exponentially. Had we arrived about 30 minutes later, we probably would have had to wait an additional hour and a half.  I ordered the Lair of the Minotaur (delicious burger on a pretzel bun served with brie cheese, pear soaked in delicious something or other and a little bit of heaven) while my husband enjoyed a burger which I forget the name of, but had bacon and some sort of fruit chutney that was absolutely terrific. The waffle fries were delicious. He had a beer. I had a cream soda. Our tab with 20% tip came to about 40 bones.  These are the things I have to say in regard to the other reviews: Yes, the music is loud, but I wouldn't say it's earsplitting. I'm not a huge metal fan, and it was tolerable.  People who are offended by the small little posting of ""Rules"" inside the door need to get a sense of humor. They're not really going to turn you away if you're wearing cubs gear, but hippies really do have to use the back door.  People who are offended that the take-out ends when the patio opens need to pay attention to the size of their kitchen. It really is tiny, but our food came out fast, hot and delicious. That wouldn't be the case if they had to deal with a full patio and take-out orders. This rule exists so they can keep up the quality of their food and service. Get over it.

Would it loose its magic? Would it improve the waiting? I don't quite know.  Now, the bar is first come first serve. so the competition is pretty fierce.

Next was the ""Lair of the Minotaur"", which features bourbon soaked pears, brie, pancetta and grilled onions. I left off the onions cuz I can't stand those sulfurous little things, but it was delish nonetheless. I'm slowly learning that fruit and beef are a good combination. And no, that was not a gay joke. Lastly I had the ""Pantera"", which is a stomach pounding behemoth covered with enchilada sauce, roasted poblano peppers, tortilla strips and pepper jack cheese. Damn was this good! My brother tried the chicken version of this sammy, and said it was just as fan-freaking-tastic. I also recommend the ""BBQ Pork Fries"".

2009-12-30,4.0,"Holy moly, the Kuma's Corner burgers are enormous AND mouth watering. Since my move to Chicago, that is all I have heard about this tucked away ""hole"". Tom and I were looking for something fun to do on a dreary day while out driving around. We remembered that Kumas was in the area off Belmont and decided to give it a whirl. Beware of the wait! For the two of us it was said that we would have an hour and a half wait time. However, after throwing some elbows and befriending a few people sitting at the bar--we were able to ""belly up"" and enjoy. Not to mention tasting some macaroni and cheese from a very happy customer sitting before us at the bar. Ah, the Midwestern mentality of sharing, knowing your neighbor and overall friendliness. Kuma's theme is heavy metal music, naturally the menu is reflective of just that. For our massive appetites we ordered two different types of burgers. I had the Iron Maiden, while Tom chowed on the Mastodon with waffle fries. They were both so delicious, complete with great sauces and cooked to perfection. The guy sitting next to me at the bar order the infamous Kuma Burger. There are no words to describe how large his meal was. What was even more impressive is that he finished every last bit of it! Tom and I were not as complete with our burger consumption as our company sitting next to us, but we made pretty good dents in the burgers nonetheless. We were both in a food comma for the rest of the day. So, when you visit Kuma's be sure to come in with a hefty appetite, since there is no doubt in my mind that it will be filled to the brim by the time you leave.

2009-12-27,3.0,"A place like Kuma's is hard to review.  Do you judge the food based simply on what is on the plate?  Or do you take into account the inconvenience involved in getting to that plate of food?  I think I will split the difference on this one. Food - 4 stars.  The burger I ate was excellent.  It was the December special, the Eyehategod burger.  Topped with bleu cheese stuffed bacon-wrapped dates, the combination was creative and unexpected.  The burger was juicy and cooked to a perfect medium.  The fries were good, unobtrusive and not trying to take away from the burger.  If I could walk into Kuma's, sit down at the bar, and grab a burger this would be one of my go-to places. Everything Else - 2 stars.  Standing packed in for hours, or having to go spend more money to kill time at a bar in order to wait for your food just sucks.  The whole ""we're metal til we die"" theme becomes comedic when 90% of the clientele are yuppies in peacoats with bags that cost more than the average car did a decade or so, and families with children.  And while I love gothic quasi-vampiric porn as much as the next guy I could live without it while I eat.  The woman at the front did a good job of managing the chaos, and tipping us to where empty bar stools would be minutes before they actually opened up, so I give her credit.  But honestly, it's just not worth it for a burger you can make at home with a trip to the grocery store. That's the difference, to me, between somewhere like Kuma's and a similarly packed place like Hot Doug's.  I can't really replicate Doug's at home.  I could replicate Kuma's. Sure, give the place a chance if you can get there early, or don't mind killing two hours somewhere else before hand, but I'm not sure it lives up to the hype. One caveat, I don't drink beer.  I suspect this would be more of a destination if I were a beer drinker, as the list seemed expansive and creative.",0.9547,0.839,0.111,0.049,0.5479646697388633

He told me that they had amazing burgers and it was metal themed. I was in and so we went. Now if anyone reading this has been to Matt's Big Breakfast out in Phoenix, you know that there is about a 30 minute wait on a good day. Kuma's is no different. We arrived and were immediately on a waiting list for 30-45 minutes. Waiting to be seated was the only complaint from me, and that complaint is very, very trivial because the food blew me away... We started with some fried calamari and hot wings. Both were fantastic! The wings weren't chicken wings...instead, Kuma's has class and offers a whole turkey wing! Wait, there's more... It's served with a truffle sauce. Yes! A truffle sauce. The owner of Kuma's knows his stuff. I was not expecting anything that fancy. So, I'm already in awe about everything so far and then I get my drink. I tried a new beer that I had never had before, but the waitress recommended. It is called Trois Pistolas, and it has been my favorite beer ever since that day. Alright, alright... So far I've had an amazing set of appetizers and have been introduced to my new favorite beer. Now, it's time for the burgers. I sampled three but ate one to completion, and that one was: The Lair of the Minotaur (Caramelized Onions, Pancetta, Brie, Bourbon Soaked Pears). It was unbelievable! I also got a chance to try the Slayer (Pile of fries topped with a  1/2 lb. Burger, Chili, Cherry Peppers, Andouille, Onions, Jack Cheese, and Anger) and the Pantera (Roasted Poblano Pepper, Bacon, Chedder and Monterey Jack, House made Ranchero Sauce, Tortilla Strips). Every bite was mouthwatering. I could taste the creativity of each burger, and none of them tasted alike. There is a lot more to say about this place and I will update this review if I can think of more key points to add. It doesn't matter what I add though, you NEED to go to Kuma's Corner!

2009-12-09,5.0,"My first review! Wooooo! This will be relatively easy, as Kuma's is the best burger in Chicago. I've tried 'em all - don't try to convince me otherwise.   A few things to understand about Kuma's:  1. They play metal. Loud.  If you can;t handle it, you probably should order take out. 2. They don't take reservations, and if you go at a typically lunch/dinner time you're going to be waiting.  So, nestle up to the bar and have a brew - they have an awesome selection. 3. The kitchen is small and therefore you may end up smelling like burgers if you sit inside - I happen to like this. My girlfriend loves burger cologne, so we're all good. If any of these disclaimers don't appeal to you - don't go.  However, the burgers are the best - sizeable, cooked perfectly, and a wide variety of toppings.  My favorite is the Dark Throne - goat cheese, pico de gallo and chipotle peppers..... perfection in a burger. Their mac and cheese is also amazing.  If you have room for an appetizer, I recommend the Mussels - perfectly steamed and spiced in Allagash. I'll say it again: best burger in the city, not even close.",0.9951,0.749,0.243,0.008,0.5980392156862746

2009-12-08,4.0,"The plan was to kill 2 birds with 1 stone: a small bite at Hot Doug's then another small bite afterwards at Kuma's Corner.  Hey, they aren't really close to anything else that we were doing but they are conveniently located around the corner from each other so it made sense. Anyway, we headed to Hot Doug's first, but unfortunately discovered that they had randomly closed for a couple weeks according to the sign on the door.  That was a bummer.  But from the glass half-full POV, we could now have a full meal at Kuma's Corner.    We got there and the wait was long.  I think we ended up waiting for 45 minutes or an hour.  Shocking.  Nah, not really - the place is tiny and popular so it's not surprising.  Grabbing a drink (La Fin du Monde ftw) at the bar helps pass the time though.   The restaurant itself is smaller than I expected but is pretty cool and definitely fairly metal-y (metal LPs lining the bar, dark erotica on the walls, music, etc.).  I liked it.  Service before and during the meal was good.   After being seated, we decided to start out with an order of the create-your-own mac & cheese - we went with bacon and caramelized onions.  This was a great move in that the quality was awesome (delicious).  But the quantity was a bit overkill - it's seriously enough for 2 people to make a full-sized meal out of.  I wish I had known it was that big.  I also wish they offered half-sized portions.  We ended up wasting a bunch of it since we couldn't take it with us.  Regardless, I'm glad we got it because it was really tasty - putting it under the broiler with a layer of cheese and some crumbliness on the top would really set it off even more though.   As far as the burgers go, it's hard to pick one - there are quite a lot that sound amazing.  But being from the ATL, I had to go with the Mastodon burger (basically a standard cowboy burger).  Simply put, it was a massive, delicious gutbomb.  The burger was pretty well seasoned and properly cooked medium-rare as requested.  It was definitely a successful patty.  The bacon and cheddar on it were both good as well.  The onion straws were a little disappointing - I'd rather have a big onion ring or two so you can actually get a good taste of the onion versus just tasting little fried crispy bits with little onion flavor (still decent though).  The bbq sauce was only ok and the flavor from that was pretty minimal since there was very little of it anyway.  The pretzel bun was certainly unique and pretty satisfying for the most part.  However, I noticed that my bun had lots of little pockets of unincorporated flour in them so the bun could've been better.  Overall, it was a great burger - maybe not the best I've had before though.  Unfortunately, the waffle fries that came with the burger weren't hot and were under-seasoned - honestly, these kinda sucked and I wouldn't try them again in the future.         So, if you couldn't figure it out by the 1000+ reviews, Kuma's Corner is definitely one of the top burger spots in the city as well as the entire country.  As long as you can wait patiently, you should have a very rewarding experience.   4",0.9985,0.74,0.201,0.06,0.5964590964590964
2009-12-07,5.0,"you know, this place is the real deal. i came here at around 10:30 on a friday night and avoided the legendary wait times; took maybe 15 minutes to conveniently get the corner of the bar for the 4 of us.  the real great thing about kuma's corner is that you can tell just about everything about it is genuine and taken with pride (enough so that regulars will fight for their ways). from the plethora of well-thought up burgers, the good beer list (and whiskey taps), the metal music blasting, and the japanese slasher movies that were playing. they do everything their way, and they can get away with it because they do it well the burgers are unique, big, well-proportioned and, most importantly, good. the only minor knock is that i ordered mine medium and it arrived medium-well to well. it was only minor, though, because it was still really good regardless (i think since the patty is thick enough that it will always be pretty juicy regardless of how it is done).  like i mentioned before, they have a good beer list. no major labels; just a good spectrum of craft beer at reasonable prices. supplement with some jameson shots, and we were good the service, our bartender, was helpful, patient and quick. and we even got into a 15 minute conversation about underground racing in/around chicago and the rest of the world with another bartender. sweet ultimately, kuma's is a place that reminds you that sometimes the neighborhood joint can just be and feel better than anything else you can remember. it can keep you honest. and i wished i lived nearby",0.9906,0.81,0.167,0.024,0.6043103448275862
2009-12-07,1.0,"First off, it should be stated that this is a negative review. Not of Kuma's food, but of its service. My last trip with friends to Kuma's was hostile and extremely uncomfortable, as staff and even management were extremely passive and even outright aggressive, and, as such, the visit was an extremely unpleasant one. I arrived with a friend and my girlfriend, and we were informed there was an hour and a half wait - nothing out of the ordinary there, and we all agreed that was fine. What wasn't fine, however, was a continually hostile hostess barking at us that we were in her way, (it's worth pointing out there's no designated waiting area - you just stand where there's open space), and yelling that we had to move. Later, after a lengthy waiting period, we saw people getting seated that we suspected arrived well after us. We asked about this and the hostess (a shorter, blonde woman) became instantly aggressive and condescending -- I've had ex-girlfriends less hostile than she turned out to be. Finally, when our table did become available, she walked over, pointed to it, didn't say a word, and stormed off. After waiting an hour and a half, though, we decided to still eat, and the food was fine. But still -- when you're paying $10+ per burger, and waiting an hour and a half on your feet, you shouldn't also have to endure extremely hostile restaurant staff, as well. Meeting with a manager named Frank was similarly disappointing and confrontative - he asked what happened, proved extremely short and curt, acted too busy to listen, then said he'd ""look into it."" Which means nothing to me as a visitor to the restaurant -- what does that do to make up for our hostile visit? There was no offer of follow-up or even any real apology. I wasn't looking for someone to pick up our $50 tab or anything. All we wanted was an enjoyable experience getting gourmet burgers. What we got was a consistently aggressive treatment for no reason whatsoever. I'll be passing on my experience to everyone I know.",-0.9468,0.792,0.084,0.124,0.4459770114942529
2009-12-07,5.0,"Food: 10.5/11:  High expectations were met. I ordered the famous Kuma's burger... I love sunny-side up eggs on anything. It was so great I even ate nearly half of my girlfriend's (who enjoyed hers too, but in an effort to be ladylike, never finishes everything on her plate). I would have ordered the mac and cheese too, because it did look very good. The problem was that I was so filled up from beer, there was no way I could have finished their giant 10$ trough. I asked if they do half orders, but sadly they do not (suggestion to Kuma's: start doing half orders).  As you will notice, I docked them .5 points on my scale. This is because I was looking for flaws. And I did find one flaw. Their bacon (the forbidden fruit) could have been crispier. That's right Kuma's, you're not infallible. The bacon was chewy.  Other than that, I had a very good eating experience. I usually don't even like waffle fries, but these were nice and crispy. The ketchup, which is supposedly homemade, was also a surprisingly refreshing change from your everyday fry dip.  Drinks and Bartenders: 10/11:  We got there at 6:45 Saturday night. We were told by the hostess that there would be a two and half hour wait. This I expected. So we put our names down on the list and immediately started staking out a place at the bar. It was a tough operation because there were multiple groups eyeing the same patrons who looked like they were finishing up their meals. As usual, I prevailed. And we were able to sit down within twenty minutes of arrival. That's right, I sat down at Kuma's, after waiting twenty minutes, at around 7pm, on a Saturday night.  For drinks, I ordered the Alpha King, the Allagash and a bottled Dark Horse IPA. All were great. I would have like to see more beers (read IPAs) on tap though. The prices were reasonable. I recall seeing Allagash at other places for ten bucks or more. I think it only cost $5 there.  The bartenders were all very amiable and engaged us in conversation. Learned a few interesting facts: apparently, up until recently, Kuma's required all of their service staff to have full sleeve tattoos.  Service: 8/11:  But honestly, its Kuma's so who really cares.  Tip: If you're going there by cab in the winter, maybe call a cab before you go outside.

2009-12-04,4.0,"I've had the opportunity to dine at this joint twice. Once was a relaxing Friday afternoon and another was a random weekday for lunch. The wait was a consistent 30 - 60 mins for a weekday lunch and pretty typical.  The first visit was a great experience because we sat outside on a Friday afternoon. It was a tiny bit chilly, so we decided to start off with a random brew - Allagash was my weapon of choice. The random brew then led to a shots of the on tap bourbon. Let's just say by the end of the meal, we were having a preeeetty good time. I heard rumors of the legendary burgers and had the Lair of Minotaur (Caramelized Onions, Pancetta, Brie, Bourbon Soaked Pears) and that was MONEY. Also, you can't hate on waffle fries, so good. The whole meal itself was more than enough for me, so I don't know how people are able to cram in appetizers. My buddies got the High on Fire and the Kuma Burger. All were very happy. All in all, it was a great first experience and I'd take any out of towner to this burger joint. Second time, I decided to squeeze in the custom mac and cheese (onions and bacon). It was good, but not amazing. You can definitely tell the cheese was better quality than your typical stuff, but again, I didn't think it was anything to rave about. For my burger, I got the Mastodon. I thought it was solid, but definitely wish I went with something more exotic like the Lair of Minotaur. I think Kuma's really shines in their more unique burgers that other burger joints don't offer.  Great times. Unique atmosphere.

2009-11-30,4.0,"Because I didn't eat ENOUGH for Thanksgiving, I decided to also go to Kuma's Corner the Monday after....just in case any light exercise I was doing was burning any calories away at all. To be fair, my trip was kind of spontaneous...I got a call from my boyfriend and his two friends who planned to pick me up the the way to Kumas, because there was a ""short wait."" I had read reviews and browsed through ""best burger"" articles about Kuma's namesake burger, so I knew what I was getting myself into.  The thousand reviews below say it all-- heavy metal music, Korean cinema, ""tasteful"" artwork, ""death to hipsters"" waitresses and, uh... hipsters are packed into this studio-sized burger heaven.  I was a little worried about the heavy metal music I'd heard about, but thankfully my brain quickly dulled the ""wicked"" guitar riffs and replaced them with rhythmic pangs of hunger from watching people eat.     One hour and an Orange Soda later, after adjusting our menus to find a shred of light to read them in, we ordered the Make Your Own Mac as an appetizer (bacon and sausage) and 5 burgers-- three Kuma burgers, one Black Sabbath and one Motorhead (mine).  I took it easy on the Mac, which was cheesy, bacony and SO flavorful, because I had an hour to observe the mammoth-sized burgers that followed. Everyone at the table thoroughly enjoyed their burgers.  My boyfriend, who usually slathers ranch on all burgers, didn't even ask for any.  The goat cheese that topped my burger was rich and creamy and went so well with the seasoned patty and black olives.  All burgers were cooked exactly to our asking and the waffle fries were the perfect match.  Kuma's definitely packs a crave-worthy burger.  The prices are right at about an average of $11 a burger, and unless you're in to stretching your stomach, you will probably have leftovers.  Be prepared for a wait, but take comfort in knowing you will be rewarded for your efforts.",0.9907,0.839,0.134,0.027,0.5629120879120879

2009-11-29,4.0,"Everything there is to be said has already been said, but I'll give it my go anyway.  First off, while Kuma's might not like it, the place can effectively be described as ""cutesey."" There's a theme to the menu, metal bands though it may be, and even a little rule sheet on the wall where you walk in. These are all the hallmarks of a place that's invented a persona for itself. Of particular note, the rules state that no Miller or Budweiser shall be served. Because obviously, a place like Kuma's is way too cool for those kind of plebeian horse urine beers. And they do, to their credit, have a good looking beer selection. Except: they have PBR available. So, you're saying that a non-discriminating beer drinker (and I know guys who just don't like beer all that much, and are perfectly happy with your run of the mill American beers) can't get a Bud or an MGD, but super hipster PBR makes the flavor and sophistication cut? Get over yourself.  Now, further complicating things is the ""Die EMO Die"" scrawled in chalk above the bar. I hate Emo too. But guess what, I see a lot of those kids pounding PBR. So do I award some brownie points for senseless Emo hate? Or get confused at luring them in?  We came on a Saturday, like fools, and waited about 90 minutes for a table, but whatever. It's a thing, right? While we waited, we watched Hero and Ninja Scroll on the TV over the bar - kind of a martial arts themed night.  To the burgers: Good. Quite good. And big. My ""Lair of the Minotaur"" was excellent, with brie, bourbon soaked pears, sauteed onions, and bacon. I ordered the burger medium rare, and it came pretty pink throughout. Fine by me, but if you're used to restaurants overcooking at all levels to save themselves a lawsuit, you might want to order one level more done than you are used to. The burger itself wasn't too heavily seasoned - which was nice, considering none of my toppings are particularly strong - it was good not to lose the flavors in a bunch of seasoned salt. Others enjoyed the...something...with goat cheese, tzatziki sauce, and kalamata olives - very good. And...the Slayer, which was, no joke, a huge 10oz burger smothered in chili and sausage links. The chili was probably about 75% meat by volume. The chili was good, too. Spicy, not too onion-y, not too cumin-y.  Finally, a ""make your own"" mac-and-cheese was tasty with prosciutto and mushrooms. Sprinkled on top was a good handful of scallions, which makes the appearance of scallions as an ingredient choice kind of interesting. I guess if you really like scallions? Anyway. The cheese was tasty, and the pasta was al dente - a good job all around, and a good option for those not looking for the meat sweats.  I was a good boy, and I ate the whole burger...and followed that up by being uncomfortably full for the rest of the night. At $11, this is a lot of food - you could cut this in half, eat one piece, and be full, then eat it again the next day. So maybe look at it as a couple $5.50 reasonably sized burgers?  Usually, I would say I'd go back. But honestly, it's pretty inconvenient to wait that long, and I'm unlikely to make it back down on a weeknight when the wait is shorter. So, through no fault of their own, I would have to be taking out of town guests back to make this trip again.

Great beer selection too, stuff you've probably never heard of, which is always fun.  My only gripe was the waffle fries, which were way lame and not crispy.  Next time I'll get the homemade chips instead.  Also, as far as the famed wait, we went right at noon on a Sunday (which is when they open) and got the last table before the wait started.  So that was a sweet deal.",0.986,0.736,0.204,0.06,0.5479296066252589

We didn't have the money for a full meal so decided to go to hang out and drink some coffee. When we got there our friends said they were planning on buying our meals so we started getting excited. We are vegan and vegan friends have told us you can get the veggie burger and leave stuff off, but we figured we'd talk to the waitress just in case. After waiting for an hour plus we were seated. Disclaimer: I FULLY understand that Kumas is not a vegan restaurant. But the veggie burger gave us hope and we asked the waitress what burger we could make vegan that would still be good. She suggested a few like ""oh yeah, people totally do this all the time"". Another half hour wait for the food and my partner's comes out with a big slab of cheese on it. He sends it back. I'm ready to bite into mine when another waitress comes over to inform us that there is cheese IN the burger. She was kind of apologetic but more like, ""I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do"". I told her I was only frustrated because our waitress acted like vegans ate there all the time and didn't check to see if we could. I am also allergic to dairy so this is a bigger deal for me. The chef came out and was very nice, talked to us about options we had (which mostly included some salads that had honey in the dressing) and was very honest about how they cook their chips (in the same fryers as fish products, but with new oil at the beginning of each day). We decided to go with coffee. All of this could be left in the ""misunderstanding"" category and I would be fine with just never going back there. But our waitress was SO RUDE at this point. The first thing she said wasn't even an apology, it was ""I didn't know there was cheese in there"" in a very defensive tone and then just walked away. Next she came up to us and said she was sorry about it but then continued to tell us that she used to eat them and had no idea. I asked if she was vegan and she said she used to be and then went into this story that berated us on how she started ""loosening up"" and eating other things and how veganism makes you fat. It was so insulting. Kumas: First, if you're going to serve a veggie burger why not go all the way and just get one without cheese?

After much deliberation, my brother in law decided that he needed to try the Chicken Tortilla Soup - as well as the Famous Kumas burger.  I opted for the Plague Bringer.   This burger packed so much flavor and so much punch, I couldn't believe my taste buds..  Freaking awesome!  The beer we had was Brown Suggah, and it was hoppy with a hint of spice and a whopping 10% abv.   Do I need to recommend Kuma's to anyone?  Yes, if they haven't heard of it, but if you are on Yelp, and checking reviews, the repuation of this place has already sold itself.

I tried the Kuma Burger and the Iron Maiden (my friend and I each ordered one, and then he gave me half of his and vice versa) and both were so amazing.

I ordered it Medium Well, but fortunately my boyfriend saved our street cred by ordering his Medium Rare. And yeah, the waitress gave him a nod of approval. The Slayer- amazing. Jack and Andouille (no bun) topped on a bed of waffle fries. Amazing. It was spicy, but not so much that you couldn't still taste the burger, and all kinds of delicious. You need to order this. We also had a bowl of the chicken and black bean soup, which was the special of the day. It was very good and big enough to split. It came with tortilla strips and oyster crackers.

2009-11-18,5.0,"I hardly ever give a place 5 stars, but this restaurant is well deserving. Upon leaving this place, you are left feeling along the lines of the restaurant's theme: like a rockstar.     Now, I am not so keen on hamburgers (that is what this place is known for); however, I have also never had a hamburger smothered in pico de gallo and goat cheese. Holy originality and goodness. My mouth literally waters just thinking about the burger I ate there. The burgers (while $10) are so big that it takes 2 meals to finish them. They are also served on a pretzel bun and not a traditional hamburger bun. This just makes them that much better!   This place is super small for it being so popular. They should think about expanding its space, and it's somewhat hard to hear others in your party; however, one must consider the theme: metal band.  You enjoy your lunch and/or dinner listening to hard rock/heavy metal while being helped by a super friendly staff decked out in tattoos and crazy colored hair. I don't want to say it is touristic because the place still encombers a ""neighborhood"" type feel to it since it is small; however, it is one of those ""got-to-try"" restaurants while in this city.    A huge downfall: the popularity for this place has caused waits to be up to 2-3 hours long. This is definately not rockstar/VIP treatment. Also, they do not accept reservations over the phone. You must be there in person to give your name. What I suggest? Go on a weekday night.

The setting was a bar with heavy metal music playing in the background.  It was pretty cool except I had to either yell or be very close to the person I was talking to.  If I came here with the mentality of going to a bar and garbing a bite to eat, then this is a good bar with excellent food.  But if you are looking for a sit down restaurant and chat with friends, it was just too loud.   The main reason for the 3 stars was the unfriendliness of the wait staff.  They all looked like they were pissed off at the world.  When we tried to put in our to-go order, we were rudely told to have one person put in the whole order and the other people move out of the way.  As I mentioned before, the place was packed so the only place we could move to was in front of the bathrooms.  It just made the whole experience unpleasant.",0.9372,0.851,0.104,0.045,0.5682363576594347

Also tried the build your own mac (can't go wrong with crisped prosciutto and sun dried tomatoes) and the calamari (they actually batter up some roasted peppers and rosemary and the squid isn't hard and rubbery like other places, but firm yet pliable, like squid should be). The main event? The burgers are AMAZING! At the base, you have 10-12ozs of great meat, charred and juicy. The pretzel bun is nice and firm, which stands up to whatever goes on top. Now for fanciness, they have the afore mentioned pears (Lair of the minotaur) or buffalo sauce and bleu (Metallica) and a whole barrel full of other fixins that have yet to disappoint me.

Substitute House Salad or Caesar for $2.00* *All Burgers Served On A Pretzel Roll* ""OUR FAMOUS KUMA BURGER"" Bacon, Cheddar, Fried Egg - $10 Cooking Style/Temp: Medium. At 10oz, this thing was a beast, and it came a little undercooked, but that's better than overcooked. Flame Grilled. Additions/Subtractions: got it as listed on the menu, with waffle fries Burger: 4.5 This burger was the Godzilla of burger patties, 10oz of freshly ground and hand formed beef. I'm not a ""giant burger"" fan, but the char-grilling added good flavor and the meat was light and juicy. It was a little undercooked, better that than overcooked and dried out, however. The more well-done parts of the burger had more flavor than the the less cooked parts. Next time I'll ask for medium+. Bun: 4.5 I was apprehensive about the pretzel bun. I don't care for them on sandwiches, I find them too chewy and the pretzel coating can overwhelm. Not in this case. I can't think of any other kind of bun that can handle the tractor trailers that are Kuma's Burgers. It was just soft enough, but sturdy enough to handle any toppings you pile onto that viking shield of beef.  Toppings: 5 With all the variations available I was tempted to go off the deep and and get the craziest and most delicious sounding concoction they had, but to get a good feel for the place I wanted to go with the ol' #1. I'd also been meaning to get a burger with egg on it, so this presented the perfect opportunity.  Egg, over easy, bacon, cheddar, I also added lettuce, onion, tomato, ketchup and mayo. All fresh, all so tasty. The bacon was perfectly cooked, the egg was over easy that went to a more viscous medium as it rested on the hot burger, perfect. I could pick out each element in every bite (except for the cheddar, which i don't like on burgers too much because it loses it's flavor when you melt it) but at the same time the flavors melded together so well. I credit the egg yolk. So good. Accoutrements: 5 Delicious waffle fries, Homemade kettle chips, options for salads, all made fresh. Good beers, a couple that I'd never had but were delicious, on tap, plus PBRs, and appetizers. I'd try it all if I could. Atmosphere: 5 A small bar with a tiny 16x16 kitchen, about 10 tables, blasting face-melting heavy metal, cool as shit staff and a clientele who were there for the best burgers for hundreds of miles in any direction? I'll take it! The wait can be long, but we went there at 11:30 at night and it wasn't too bad. and yeah, the place was full of people eating burgers that late. Some ""regular"" people might not be able to deal with the atmosphere, but chances are, if you aren't decked out in performance fleece and khakis, you should be just fine. Overall: 4.8 A near perfect score. If I were a bigger fan of pretzel buns and giant burgers, we probably would be talking all 5's. There are a few things that, to me make awesome burgers, and Kuma's ticks most of the boxes. Two of biggest ones (besides taste obviously), Kuma's has in spades. One is that when I'm eating it, my hands get messy and juicy and I need a napkin to clean up, the other is if I can still taste it, days later. As I type this, I can still remember the flavors, textures, everything. Unbelievable. This was the second best burger I've ever had. Do yourself a favor and drive to Chicago right now and get one. You'll be glad you did.",0.999,0.778,0.187,0.035,0.5672964022279091

When we arrived there were a couple small groups outside waiting and the inside was packed but it is a tiny place. Only one of us went in to put our name down and i was stunned when she came back and said two hours. i figured that sucks but it will be only 1-1 1/2 hours. once again i was wrong it was two hours and twenty three minutes and then we had to sit at the bar!! seems like a long time for a cheeseburger. once inside the staff was fast to get drinks, bring menus, and take our orders two of us got the neurosis and one got the kuma burger. the burgers were the best food i have ever eaten! i didn't touch my fries because after one bite i was determined not to leave till this giant burger was gone. i was successful but couldn't look at food the next day. I ordered it medium rare and to my suprise it was MEDIUM RARE! the juices were every where and the pretzel bun just soaked them up. we didn't try the mac&amp;cheese and that was probably a mistake because the couple nat to us ordered it and it looked and smelled just as good as the burgers. in short, the best burgers in chicago and next time i will wait even longer if i must!",0.9665,0.838,0.113,0.049,0.518287037037037

We finished our drinks and stood outside for about 10 min and then the hostess called us in.  Between the 3 of us, we tried the Black Sabbath, Metallica and Motorhead. They were all so good! I would say that I liked Motorhead the best--we did scrape off some of the goat cheese (there was so much!) but it was still really good. I think I liked Motorhead the best too because hubsbie had it cooked Medium. I always order medium-well for my burgers but he had it right. I order medium for steaks, I really should opt for that for burgers now.  The build-your-own Mac N Cheese was really good. (Bacon and Roasted red peppers).

I expected with all the hype that the food would become anticlamactic and overrated. I was wrong.  I ripped on people for waiting three hours to get in. I think I still wouldn't do that, but on a Tuesday night it's a shorter wait. For a place where I was expecting to be sitting outside for three hours it was an hour and a half wait. The seating is meager, which accounts for the long waits during peak times. The metal is loud, but it wasn't obnoxious. The only problem i had with the atmosphere was the lighting. I couldn't read the menu. I had to use my cell phone as a flashlight. The service was slow, but the waitress was nice so I give that one a pass. Now the food, the reason we came here to begin with, is the reason for the four star review. It's almost like they took random ingredients from the refrigerator and threw it on a burger and dubbed it a heavy metal name. But the grilled burgers are excellent. I ordered the Black Sabbath a burger with pepper jack, chili, blackening spices, red onion. I sampled two other burgers ordered by my sister and brother-in-law. The Metallica (bacon, buffalo sauce, bleu cheese) was good. The Motorhead was also good, but the goat cheese was overwhelming. We had to take some out, but once it was toned down, I think it was the best of the three. Now the mac and cheese, which everyone raves about, was all that I had hoped. It had that home made style to it. We had it ""built"" with bacon and red peppers. It's made with real cheese and it's topped with bread crumbs and green onions. I wanted to eat the whole thing, but it was just an appetizer and I feared I wouldn't be able to eat my burger if I did.",0.9745,0.869,0.096,0.035,0.5324372759856633

A hair.  It's about 3 inches long and it's dark.  I am somewhat grossed out.  What is POSSIBLY more disturbing is that, after I pull the hair OUT of my burger, I actually contemplate finishing it.  Your burgers are that good.  I debate the issue and try to rationalize finishing the burger (hair, big deal, it's probably not that dirty, I'd probably continue eating if it was my hair, there could be worse things, etc etc).  Ultimately, the gross factor wins out.  Dinner ruined.  Movie is paused.  I rummage for something else to eat. Kuma's Corner... I don't know if your guys wear hair nets when they make those patties or what the process is, but could you please do something to ensure that NO HAIR gets into the food?  That is not too much to ask.  I would really like to come back again but now I'm skeeved out.  I'm sorry, maybe I'm a wuss, but hair in my food... gives me the willies.  For that reason, I'll never buy ice cream from a vending machine or eat anything from Taco Bell again (true stories, both).

2009-10-18,5.0,"Kuma's Corner has been on my sight since I landed in Chicago. I was so excited to try this place and when I got here, I didn't mind waiting two hours to get my mouth on their tasty burgers. What an interesting concept of combining a bar that serves burgers with a rock band/horror film theme. I don't even know how to describe this place, you just have to see it for yourself. While the wait is terrible, the staff is friendly enough and try to be as accommodating as possible. It's basically first come, first serve.  When I first took a look at the menu, I didn't realize what was so special about their burgers. Sure, they had funky names, but some of their ingredients resembled those found at Red Robbin. I know now that what I just said would be considered blasphemous. They aren't just considered the best burgers in Chicago for nothing. I had my taste of three different burgers here. I know, you can save the fatass comments for later. My favorite has to be the YOB. The smoked Gouda is undeniably delicious and the roasted garlic mayo is outstanding. Next, I tried my hand at the Plague Bringer. I am a lover of spicy foods so it was natural that I would try something that had pepper jack and jalapenos. In the end, I really liked it for its tortilla chips. Lastly, I tried the famous Kuma burger with the cheddar and fried egg. What was the secret to these delicious burgers? The meat was cooked perfectly and they were served on pretzel rolls. I love these pretzel rolls. The waffle fries were also excellent, but as I became more full, I found myself eating more of the pretzel roll bread than the fries. Since they have a denser texture, they don't get soggy like your ordinary bread rolls.  Lastly, I also tried the 'make your own' mac 'n cheese. I've never seen this concept before, but you can add ingredients to it up to a certain amount, then you pay a premium for each additional item. We went with prosciutto, sun-dried tomatoes, and scallions. I thought mac 'n cheese always needed bacon to be delicious, but those three combination of ingredients made it a winner.

I'm impressed and sold.  I live a short walk down Belmont.  However, the wait gets to me like the rest of you.  So I take PTO and go.  You heard me.  I actually took a day off work to hang out at Kuma's.  No regrets.  I mean I get to spend the afternoon w/ my unemployed friends, drinking bourbon from a tap (this is fantastic, wish more places had it), and enjoying what I love about Chicago (the uniqueness that can't be copied). So Kuma's, I've taken you on and you've won me over.   The next burger on my list is the Lair of the Minataur by the way.  Accompanied by Woodford Reserve on tap.  Burgers and Bourbon kids...go and enjoy!",0.9888,0.782,0.188,0.03,0.4885555555555555
2009-10-15,2.0,"The burgers are phenomenal, truly the best non-high grade beef burgers, and the best damn fries, and the best portion-sized meal for the money I've ever had, so why the two stars? The wait. The wait (in our case, three hours on a Wednesday night 7 p.m., no lie) ruins everything good about this place. I blame it on two things: poor management and poor hostess practices.  The hostess wasn't any help in alleviating the wait. Metal-place, schmetal place, you still run a business and it's the hostess's job to smooth over long waits. Even if your hostess is covered in tattoos and piercings (as I am), there's just no reason for the attitude and you should train such a hostess in such a tight-space establishment to be on it, both in temperament management and seating.  Offer water for the long, hot wait, fer chrissakes. Have her checking on folks who seem to be standing around for a long time every now and then, not just standing there looking half pissed and half bemused by the frustrated response. Have her greet people as if she genuinely gives a crap that they're giving her money--that sort of thing. And after a three-hour wait, she should surely be saying, ""Thank you for waiting so patiently, I know it's crazy."" If she's not, then get rid of her, because she's not making the wait staff higher tips and she's not making you money, period.   Kuma's, I implore you, get a hostess who actually likes people and understands that the goal is to avoid money walking out the door, because your food is awesome, your wait staff is unbelievably helpful and on it (I'm assuming they tip the hostess out, a pity), and even though you have crouch-exposing, leather-clad, blood-covered women on your wall, your place rocks. But just like having a bad drummer can ruin a great band, your hostess sucks and should be replaced.  Every time someone walks out that door from the long wait, you're losing business. On my three-hour wait, I watched as 12 tables walked out, which is-what- $500 to $1200 profit? I can't help but think that this is just another sign of not-so-great planning on management's part.  And while I'm on the management-should-really-pay-attention train, you're in Avondale. Property can't be that expensive and your burgers are $10-$13 a pop with a packed house every night, all day.  You've got to be raking in the dough, so either expand on the place you got or move to a bigger place. There's just no justification as to why you can't and it's ridiculous not to do so. I bet you could get a great deal on property right now, while creating much-needed jobs for the tattoed and pierced among us.",0.9458,0.833,0.096,0.071,0.5270723104056437

For lunch, I decided to get the YOB, which had smoked gouda, bacon, roasted red peppers, and roasted garlic mayo on a pretzel roll along with criss-cut fries. A lot of the burgers are named after rock/heavy metal bands like Black Sabbath, Metallica, and Led Zeppelin. The first bite I took of the YOB burger was mouth watering delicious. It was pretty big too, so I cut into four pieces so I can enjoy the burger without making a big mess. It was a near perfect burger.

The burger was fantastic! Huge, fresh patty on a pretzel roll that was able to hold up to the ingredients without overwhelming. The pear was such a subtle touch and the flavor stayed with me, pleasantly, after the meal. The salad was also really nice- great dressing, fresh ingredients.

Anecdotes like the time my brother took my parents here and one of our friends unabashedly ordered the Goblin Cock. The best f'ing burger in Chicago.

They had already gotten their appetizer leftovers wrapped up and were moving to a table I've definitely had friendlier service, but it'd seem foolish to expect a perky, bubbly waitress at a metal bar. We got our order's in quick and waited. This part took a bit, but the atmosphere was comfortable enough. We sat in the patio section, which meant things were a little brighter, and the music was a little more conducive to conversation.  I ordered the YOB burger, which included smoked gouda, bacon, roasted red peppers, and roasted garlic mayo on a pretzel roll with homemade french fries. I was initially slightly disappointed. The roasted peppers seemed to be the kind out of the jar and were a little too slimy for my taste, and the roasted garlic mayo seemed to be a little lacking. After ditching the RRP, though, it actually was the best burger I think I've ever had. It just took a moment to realize that I was definitely there for the burger and not the accoutrements, and once I got down to that it definitely rewarded.

I just ate through it and didn't complain because after all it did take about 40 minutes to arrive. The bun wasn't toasted but it was very soft and fresh so it wasn't really necessary. So the YOB had roasted peppers, smoked Gouda and a garlic mayo. The peppers seemed as if they were canned and the Gouda was not even a factor in the thing. I think it needed more cheese.

A LONG, sweaty ""nuts to butts"" wait. We can go ahead and assume that's the standard. But, the first time we waited, they were playing wacky Kung-Fu flicks on the television. One movie was about an autistic girl from Thailand who learned Muay Thai from watching Tony Jaa films. It was stupendous, and made the wait bearable.  The second time, the televisions were off and the music was loud and really aggressive. This was a mistake. The hardcore metal music coupled with the wait, my Ethiopianesque hunger and the smell of stale cigarettes and sweat coming from the group in front of us had me INFURIATED. In cases where there's a long wait, I'd recommend letting the Kung Fu movies play or blast some Michael McDonald instead. So, after a long wait, both times, we finally get a cramped table towards the back. This is pretty much where the similarities (Pre-Show entertainment aside) ended. On my first visit, our server was SUPER rude. No, rude isn't the word. She was being a god damned jagaloon! She chastised everything from our choice in beers to our table conversation. Now, I'm a thick-skinned dude. I can take some friendly ribbing. Hell, friendly ribbing is encouraged. But this chick was just being a pretentious elitist. Every time she'd leave the table, we'd all look around in slack-jawed disbelief. I'm a grown ass man! My momma doesn't even talk to me like that. People get shivved for less where I'm from. But on the second visit, we had the most amazing server on Earth. She kinda had an Amy Winehouse look about her. And I apologize for the lame comparison, but I want you all to know who to look for should you go and have the option of sitting in her section. She was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu, made excellent food and drink recommendations based off of our preferences and left us feeling well taken care of without being overbearing. On my first visit, I didn't understand the fuss about the burgers. It was big, had some interesting toppings and the pretzel bun was a good touch, but the actual burger was just kinda ""blah."" Fancy buns and weird toppings didn't do it for me. Innovation alone does not a good burger make. But on my second visit, I had the Kobe Beef Sloppy Joe (at the servers suggestion) and it made my taste buds do back flips! It was AMAZING. The beef was spicy and the sauce was sweet. I was starting to see why people hyped this place up so much. Kuma's Corner was like Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde to me. One experience was amazing. One had greasy hair, tattered clothes and made me mad enough to use racial epithets in front of an infant. I'd recommend a visit, but you've been warned.",0.992,0.793,0.138,0.069,0.4868923611111111
2009-09-06,5.0,"Yes, most other burgers will taste as if they have been dragged through a dirty horse trough after you've been to Kuma's.  The rest as if they have been dropped on the floor. I've been going to Kuma's for two years now and the wait has gotten so bad that I will only go with someone if they haven't yet gone.  It is the only way I can rationalize the wait.  But people need to stop bitching about ""expanding the kitchen"" or ""opening a second location"".  They are doing their thing and doing it well.  Just because some clowns have to take the 77 farther west than Schuba's doesn't mean the place needs to be dropped into the middle of Lincoln Park or blown out like the Cheesecake Factory. My only slight complaint with the burgers is that the monthly specials recently have been pretty pedestrian.  A return of the Burja in October '09 would be really appreciated.",0.0005,0.83,0.082,0.088,0.5163888888888889

At 11:27 (it opens at 11:30), they started letting people in. The seating process was strangely slow as they took people in table by table and grabbed a stack of menus from a spot by the entrance everytime... Not being metalheads, we decided to sit outside. The patio area is fenced off from the street and just like a nice backyard. There are eight 2-4 people tables and four picnic benches. Our waitress was nice, though it a bit slow. I wanted to put in my order right away to avoid the queue of 30 people all ordering at once, but we didn't get food orders in until later. The girl who took care of the rest of the patio was definitely much faster about it and her first table got food before we even left. But hey, I was warned about this so I dealt with it. Ordered a Yob and a Neurosis. It took another 45 minutes from order time until we got our food, which seems pretty silly for a burger. The burger itself was good but honestly, at most 10% better than the next best burger I've had. I can't really compare since I don't have side by side taste tests. The beef was succulent and the bun was tasty, but otherwise it just seemed like a normal burger. Perhaps my hamburger palate is not up to snuff. The fries are subpar. I'm not a fan of the waffle shape and they don't really give you enough ketchup to make the shape worthwhile...

2009-08-28,5.0,"It took a long while. But I finally reached the third point of the Hipster Triangle (Hot Doug's, Urban Belly and finally Kuma's Corner). So does Kuma's Corner make the best burger in Chicago? IMHO if they don't, they are really, really close.  My running favorite for best burger in the city has been the Erwin burger with Ditka's a strong second. I went to Kuma's Corner today to see how they compare. So I got the original Kuma's cheeseburger (the one with cheddar, bacon and a fried egg). I thought I'd hate the pretzel roll but it is pretty great and not to, well, pretzely but provides a nice contrast and bite without being too chewy. The burger itself was huge and came out exactly medium rare (good). Gotta say, the fried egg is genius and just runny enough to mix with the meat in each bite and make me a very happy boy. With all that going on, the only complaint (and it is not really a complaint) is that I should have left the provided lettuce and tomato as it just made the sandwich slippery. Waffle fries a nice compliment as well and, since my burger kind of exploded at the end, were well suited to clean up the mess. I know many complain about the wait and high hipster quotient. Since I can only report on my own experience, here's my take. I did go in expecting to face a long line and did some deep breaths. But honestly, on a Friday at noon of a Cubs game, I got a seat at the bar after a 10 minute wait. And the bartenders and servers were, once they got to me, really attentive and they flat out know their beer (which I found out when my first choice was gone and I was quickly and confidently pointed to a suitable replacement). Yeah, the pulsing metal is loud. Yeah, the hipsters and frat boys are in force. If you can't deal, you can't deal. But this is honestly a fantastic burger. Oh, I did not answer my own question. I just can't pick between Erwin's burger and Kuma's as the best in the city. Luckily I don't have to.",0.9964,0.764,0.191,0.044,0.6184666666666664

All of the burgers were truly outstanding.  Of course as the Dad I got to try everyone's selection.  Everyone loved their burgers.  I thought these were just as good as Hamburger Marys burgers which I truly liked a lot.  We all had waffle fries with our burgers.  They were crisp on the outside yet just the right softness in the middle.   There was a diverse crowd of people in the restaurant.  There were young, punkers to dressed up business folks.  I did not think the music was too loud at all.  That was one of my concerns.  I loved the rules of Kuma's.  A list of 15 or so funny items.  They were truly funny!  Just be careful if you bring little ones as some of the art work on the walls could be considered x-rated by some folks standards. Overall the food, service and atmosphere was worth the price.  The four of us got burgers, fries and drinks and we spent around $52 dollars.  We definitely recommend Kuma's Corner in Logan Square for anyone who wants a really good burger!",0.9959,0.836,0.159,0.005,0.49683527257056675

2009-08-17,5.0,"I know everyone in the world has reviewed Kuma's, so I'll keep it relatively short. My friend was visiting with her boyfriend and I took three days off work. My primary goals were to show her a good time in Chicago and do things with those three days that I've been aching to do. I am terrified of attempting Kuma's on a weekend, as I picture mass chaos and riots. So we had a late lunch here on a Tuesday before doing the architectural boat tour. We were a bit worried about time because those damn tours close early, but luckily the patio was open (this was in May; I'm a bit late on this review), which seems to about double the seating here, and we only waited about 20-30 minutes. We sat on the patio; it was lovely. Our waitress was attentive and very nice, if slightly overwhelmed.  Disgustingly, we split the pulled pork fries and each ordered a burger, all while chugging beer. Yes, we're gross. The fries were AMAZING. We were almost licking the plate.  The burgers? Also amazing. Her boyfriend and I split the Mastodon and the Kuma's burgers, and she had something with mushrooms, I think. My favorite was the Kuma's. omg wait. Her boyfriend got the mussels, too. Ha. Those were really good as well.  (Here's the point where, if we were in the movie Clue, I'd say, ""...to make a long story short"" and you'd yell ""TOO LATE!"") In the end, I'll say this. My friend loooooooves burgers. She has had many in her 28 years. And she still, three months later, curses me out (in jealousy)  for living near Kuma's. The other day, I told her I had a burger with a fried egg and she wrote, ""AT KUMA'S, YOU BITCH?""",0.9883,0.776,0.155,0.068,0.5564814814814816

Every visit since then has been somewhat of a decline from the first one. The good: - Hands down best burgers you will get anywhere. - Death metal! - Bartenders and wait staff that really, I mean really know their beer selection. Some know it better than others. I recommend sitting at the bar. - Killer beer selection. The only plane jane beer they have is PBR (my first love). No *fill in the blank* lite, no rich boy heineken, just damn good beers. The let down: - You would think after years of being in business they would have solved this humongous wait issue. You still have to wait 30-60 mins for a table (yes, even on a Tuesday for lunch) and then almost as long again for your food to arrive. - They have dramatically decreased the volume and heaviness of the music. I can see not having it at 11 any more so you could maybe hear yourself think but it was so weak I couldn't make out many of the songs. The ones I could make out weren't nearly as heavy or evil as days gone by (was it stoner metal night?). - Family friendly? Since when did this become a place for people to bring their bratty 12-year-old children wearing khaki shorts and polo shirts with blackberries? There were tons of kids there and people dressed like they should be in a Banana Republic commercial sooner than a heavy metal bar. Kuma's, you're too good for your own good. Your popularity is taking the edge off an otherwise welcoming home for the metal heads of Chicago. If you can wade through all the people, Kuma's will kick your ass.

The restaurant is small and hot since the half of the seats are right by the kitchen. I was slightly worried that this place was going to be flash over substance but I was wrong. While it is filled with a ton of the 20 something crowd the food is fantastic. I had the Bongzilla and it was killer. My ex had the Neurosis and I can honestly say that this is the first time I have ever had 2 different burgers that had 2 completely different tastes. Being a tattooed guy I loved the traditional flash art in the bathroom and they have pretty interesting art on the walls. This isn't a family friendly place but I was comfortable with my teenagers being there. I wouldn't bring little ones. Our waitress was beyond good. Super sweet super attentive and we tipped big to let her know how much we liked her. You do have to wait awhile for your food but in my opinion its well worth the wait. Prices were very reasonable my total check was 61.00 for 4 burgers and drinks. This is easily what I would pay at Red Robin and slightly more then Portillos and the quality is much better.

It was a Sunday:  I wanted to get there at 5pm since my friend had to meet a friend at O'Hare at 8:30pm...because of the hell that is the blue line on the weekend we got there at 6pm.  The gatekeepers said an hour, 1 1/2 hours to wait.  We got a table at 7pm.  Ordered the bbq pork waffle fries with jack cheese which came in no time at all. It was sooo delicious but it was a tease to end all tease--we thought, 'dude, we'll be in burger heaven in NO time.' We were so wrong.  Jef got antsy and didn't want to chance the wraith of his friend so he bailed at 7:45pm.  We didn't eat until ALMOST NINE.  It was pretty ridiculous. However, I became less agitated as I began to eat.  I had the 'Laird of the Minatour' which had carmelized onions, pancetta, brie and bourbon soaked pears.  That's right BOOZY-FRUIT, people, on my burger WITH brie, my favorite cheese ever.  It was ridiculously, f'ed up good.   The husband wasn't as enthused with his 'famous burger' with the fried egg...I took a bite of his and the bacon tasted kinda weird.  I felt sympathy for him as I totally ravashed my unholy awesome burger.  I stopped at half because I was full.  We wrapped our leftovers and took along Jef's forsaken burger think he probably won't eat this tomorrow (I was wrong.).  He ate it the next day and ate it cold and he still said it was awesome. On the way home, we gave our leftovers to a homeless guy--did it for pure selfish reasons: I really did want the rest of my burger as a late night snack or early morning treat.  But as I thought of my summer reading ('The end of Overeating'), the way we housed the pork fries, AND THEN ate my burger, my arteries would kick my ass later down the line.  I had to nip it in the bud.  I had my taste of kuma, got the goods and the bragging rights, I could reign myself in (for now).

True, the second set of reasons drives the first, but people were waiting ahead of me who came and were asking while waiting ""what kind of food is it?"" Really?   Since I'm nominally from out of town, I think I need to defend my even going here. 1) my brother, who lives in Avondale, has been telling me about this place for almost 2 years. 2) A Chicago resident pal posited it as a place to get together (sadly she found out about it on TV, but....) For a fairly divey place, the food here is good. Actually, let's be fair, the food here is just plain good. From the burgers, to the home made chips, to the mac and cheese construction set, it's just all solid, good food - at pretty reasonable prices. If anything there is almost too much selection on the menu - there were at least a half dozen sandwiches that I considered before deciding on the Lair of the Minotaur.  I was very pleased that one of my friend's ordered the Goblin Cock, which is awesome looking, and also happens to have about the best name possible for a foodstuff. As for the service, it was good. They seemed to have massively underestimated the wait for us to get a table (they quoted an hour, and we were seated in about 25 minutes - although maybe they were trying to scare poseurs away), but the wait for food from the 6'x12' kitchen is not understated. You will be waiting for your food, at which point the nice beer selection comes in handy. Our waitress did a great job of answering various questions, and was nothing if not attentive. High marks for service indeed. In closing, I would like to point out that a burger here is more food than a person should really be eating in one meal. Sharing is probably not a bad idea!

The burger was outstanding.  The burgers have a heavy metal-themed name---such as, Black Sabbath, Slayer, Metallica.  I had the Kaijo (burger, bacon, bleu cheese and frizzled onions) and it was heavenly.  I've been obsessed with the topping combination and have been trying to recreate it elsewhere to lesser success.  My friends had the YOB (Smoked Gouda, Bacon, Roasted Red Peppers, Roasted Garlic Mayo) and, I think, the Plague Bringer (Roasted Garlic Mayo, Tortilla Strips, Chicago CO-OP hot sauce, Fresh Garlic, Pepper Jack, Sliced Jalapenos).  Each comes with fries or chips and sub for a salad for $2---both the fries and salad are enough for two.  Everyone highly enjoyed their meal.   The extensive beer selection was, sadly, lost on me---I'm not a beer girl.",0.9935,0.74,0.208,0.051,0.4425889328063241

We stopped by on a Monday around 1:30 and it was pretty well packed.  Since there were just two of us we were able to snag a couple of chairs at the bar where our darkhaired bartendress was doing her best to efficiently handle a packed counter.  Her service was friendly and as good as it could be considering how many people she was dealing with. I had the ""famous Kuma's burger.""  It was medium rare as ordered, although I wished the bacon was more crisp.  The homemade fries were good.  The burger was greasier than necessary, larger than necessary (two people could EASILY split one), and not really so groundbreaking in my opinion that it lived up to the hype of the reviews.  I definitely wouldn't show up at prime hour and wait in line for it.",0.9878,0.819,0.151,0.03,0.5589880952380952

Likes  - I'm biased, not going to lie.  Runny egg on a (Kuma) burger really does it for me.  Generally not huge on bacon either, but it was delish.  Almost forgot - high on manageability, large but just small enough not to fall apart and slobber all over the place. - Pretzel rolls rock - Kris-Kross fries! - Rule #3 on the blackboard: ""No, we're not gonna play 'the game'"" - Mac n Cheese may have been the best I've ever had.  Lots of places claim to have the best (Home, SF; Eatery, NYC), but they usually fail to live up to their billing.  This one had just enough crisp on the top layer, green onions added an amazing touch, and of course, being built-to-order, and (probably a stick of butter) will do the trick. - Cool tattoo sample drawings in the bathroom (were those prices?) - roaring bear head statues and other cool bear art on the walls - Option of sriracha sauce.  It looked disgusting to me, but my buddy happily lapped it up. Dislikes: difficult to get here by public transport.  Probably a good thing though, or I'd be a fatass.  Which brings me to... Interesting observation: How are none of the employees here fat?  I mean, you eat your own stock right?

2009-07-21,3.0,"First things first, this place is definitely at least 4 star worthy. However, the place has definitely gotten too big for its britches.  We went on a Friday at about 2pm - we've heard about the long wait times and figured coming at the tail end of lunch would help. It did. 10 minutes within getting there, we were seated. Getting seated quickly turned out to be false hope, however. Waiting hours on end in a line doesn't phase me. Waiting 45 minutes after you've been seated does. Unfortunately their newfound popularity doesn't translate into a bigger kitchen; there is just enough space to fit maybe 3 chefs? Needless to say, this leads to long wait times and disgruntled customers. Throw in the head banging, or head wringing, loud metal music (and people trying to talk over it) and you just start to get ticked off after awhile. Luckily, the atmoshphere was really eclectic and fun; bear figurines and statues stare angrily in your direction, burgers are named after rock bands and rock paraphernalia round everything out.   Naturally when the food came out, our expectations had been raised. I ordered the burger of the month, which had Jamaican Jerk Pork and Plaintains on top of a beef patty and my girlfriend had the Slayer which was just a smorgasbord of fries, beef patties, chili, and cheese on top (no buns). My burger had a good flavor - mainly from the Jerk Sauce; the plantains didn't do anything for me. The Slayer, in theory, was a plate of things that would go awesome together; how could you go wrong? However, when executed, none of the ingredients really stood out to make it a dish you'd come back for. Fortunately, they have some other dishes that I'd like to try, namely their 'Famous Kuma Burger' (bacon, cheddar and fried egg) and BBQ Pork Fries. I'll update my review once I come back. Hopefully, it'll be a better experience. Tip: Either cozy up to the bar for a few drinks or pack a granola bar, it's gonna be a wait!",0.9814,0.833,0.124,0.043,0.5204954954954956

The food is good, the beer selection is great, the music is loud rock and metal, the decor basically tells you ""we don't care what you think,"" and they love taking your money. Average $13-15 bucks for a 2 hour burger. Maybe it's because they cook it with ""Anger."" Didn't know anger cost so much.  p.s.  Try going their during the week for early lunch.

When the waitress saw how over-cooked our food was, she mentioned this reoccurring problem to the manager & used our burgers as examples.  Immediately, we were offered the chance to get a fresh burger but we said they were still very good & we were content to eat them as-is.  It's a hectic restaurant - no need to make it worse.   When the bill came out, both burgers were gratis - no questions asked by us.  It was very generous & unexpected.  Thanks for ruling, Kuma's! (And for my money, the High on Fire is the go-to burger on that menu.  I tend to be dismayed when I sway from it.)",-0.184,0.8,0.097,0.103,0.5929270729270729

2009-06-29,4.0,"Kuma's Corner is good (and gets reviews as the Best Burger in America from many sources), and likely got a lot of new fame from Diners Drive In's and Dives. I went with a friend to the quaint location on Belmont. Parking is limited, but as luck would have it, we got a spot. We were told the wait would be 2 hours, and my fellow yelpers told me that would be accurate. The good news is that you are free to leave after you put your name down. We ran to Target and naturally went in for toothpaste and left with the entire store. Damn Target. But I digress ... The reason the wait is so long is because there are like 8 tables and they fill up quickly. There is a large bar where you can plant yourself down and grab a beer from their great selection. Its not like they are wasting space on the kitchen, which is like the size of my bathroom. However, out of this small kitchen they make some pretty serious burgers that are not suitable for children. We got the Lair of the Minotaur which has Caramelized Onions, Pancetta, Brie, Bourbon Soaked Pears ($12). It's everything you want in a burger. We also shared the Motorhead, which has Goat Cheese, Kalamata Olives, Oregano, Tzatziki, Onion, Tomato ($10). A Greek lovers dream! Juicy and delicious. Its messy and crazy tasty. The burgers comes with fries or chips, I believe but they werent anything to write home about. Lets put it this way, I dont think you are going for the fries. My only gripe is, perhaps being a Lakeview resident and all the sterotypes there, I cant dig the heavy metal music. I wouldn't bring family in here because it is just to ridiculous. I don't mind the kind of music, I mind the volume. When I sit there and get a headache (I am 26, not 86), I think we need to turn it down a few.

Came on a Monday at 7:30 PM with a party of 6.  We were told there were 2 other parties of 6 ahead of us, so we decided to split up our group.  4 of us got seated within 30 minutes, and the other 2 probably 10 minutes after that at the bar.  And it took about 60 additional minutes for our burgers to come out. Burgers ($10-12)... are all good.  Order based on the toppings you like, and you will really enjoy the quality of the meat.  The pretzel roll makes a strong statement too because it holds up well as you're gnawing through the burger. Mac and cheese ($10 for a full order)... We got it with bacon and peas, and the bacon totally overpowered the dish.  The cheese ""sauce"" ran a little too thin for my taste and was kind of bland had we not gotten the bacon. Beer ($5-12?)... everyone enjoyed the flavors and selection.  Our waitress was knowledgeable and gave good recommendations.  Definitely get one because you'll have nothing else to do while you're waiting for your food. The reason for the 3 stars is that although I think the food is worth 4 stars, Kuma's has become so popular that it's just NOT enjoyable to eat in here anymore.  It's HOT (crack open a window or build more, please?  crank up the A/C?  build a separate area for the kitchen?) - I HATE sweating while eating.  It's also crowded, loud (with heavy metal blasting), the wait is ridiculous, and it's located too far for me to want to endure all the above every time I want a burger.",0.9852,0.831,0.145,0.023,0.6352564102564103

This occurred because for some reason they do not do take out anymore during the summer. This is a problem by doing this Kuma's is isolating their customers.  There is generally a wait for a table at Kuma's which is not the end of the world obviously. A way to work around this wait but still eat burgers of the highest prestige you could just order take out. Yes it is never as good when you order take out, but in life you have to sacrifice things at times, and this is just one of those times. Now as a man who likes to consume certain plants and then eat certain delicious burgers from Kuma's this creates a problem. Because now I cannot do this, because in the summer it is a good idea to stop selling your product to people who do not want to dine in. Brilliant fucking idea on how to reduce your business's revenue and anger me.  Seriously what the fuck? Why on Earth would they stop serving take out, because it is now summertime. You lose a star Kuma's I hope you are goddamn pleased with yourself. Update!! Well apparently they do not serve take out in summer, because Kuma's patio is open.

However, I'm not really going to complain about the wait because they can't really do much about it. It's really the staff. Now, I'm not some condo owning yuppie so don't assume I want to be treated like a king, but I'm really puzzled at how such rotten attitudes could be involved in the food business. I called once just to see how long the wait was because I didn't want to drive all that way to wait for 2 hours. The lady that answered had an unnecessarily stern and angry voice replying that they ""don't bleepin' disclose wait times over the phone."" Now, I understand why they wouldn't do that.

I've had a few great servers and some real prissy ones too. I asked for a Guinness not knowing they didn't serve that type of beer and the server got flustered and pretty much tossed a drink menu on me and said ""this is what we have, I'll be back."" WTF? The list goes on.  Like I said, the food is great and I am an understanding person, but don't take your goth rage out on me. I'm not a yup and I'm not a jerk looking for a king's treatment.

I am not so cool that I'm waiting three hours for a meal. This is insane to me. That being said, we went at 3:00 on a Sunday. We were told about 30 minutes, and that's what it was.

So the burgers...I usually tend to like all things meat, bread, cheese, so it goes without saying I'm not the harshest of critics. But my husband is, and all I gotta say is those were some tasty burgers. Period. We ordered medium rare, and they were cooked perfectly. The toppings were lovely, fresh (Iron Maiden and Dark Throne?) but the star was really the juicy hamburger patty. I got the fries, good and potato-y. Hubby got the chips, later informing me if a menu ever says homemade chips to get them, and of course he was right! The chips were SO DAMN GOOD.

For those that have never had a burger there, you cannot appreciate that the wait is worth it. However, if you stick it out, you will soon be one of the converted.

2009-06-14,5.0,"I know what you're thinking - what is the point of writing review #834 of Kuma's, Jenna?  I know, it really is rather silly.  However, I figure I may as well document my experience because I really rather enjoyed myself here. Two friends and I decided to go at 11:15 on a Friday morning.  We were prepared for a wait, even though they opened at 11, and we were pleasantly surprised when there was parking right on Elston AND tons of open space outside on the patio.  Since it was a nice day and we all love dining al fresca, we decided to go with the patio.  Their menu was daunting, to say the least.  I knew I was getting a burger, but as I read through the choices, I became more and more indecisive.  I had kind of figured there would be one or two things that really appealed to me and everything else would be out of my range.   Au contraire, mon frère - all of their burgers sounded delicious in their own right.  After minutes of indecisive whining and skipping around their menu, I settled on the Motorhead and promptly closed my menu as to not persuade myself to pick something else.  One friend got the one with the pineapple on it and my other friend got the one with smoked gouda and apple (I'm bad at remembering names of things).   As a Weight Watchers participant, I was pleased when I was offered the choice of side salad to go with my burger instead of fries or chips - yay!  My advice: choose the house salad over Caesar.  The Caesar dressing tasted really buttery and garlicy but that's about it.  At first bite it seemed so bland and bizarre... and then I noticed it just kind of tasted like garlic and dairy.  It needed tons of salt, for sure.  House salad next time it is.   Mmmmmm that burger: sooooooo yummy!  I love goat cheese and kalamata olives so thank God they were both on this burger.  The meat was cooked to my medium-well preference perfection and the pretzel roll was super tasty as the bun for this superb burger.  The goat cheese was melty, salty and super awesome and it just made the burger.  I could only eat half because it was soooo big so it was nice to take home the leftovers. The other burgers?  Done just as well.  I give Kuma's props for figuring out which flavor combinations work well together.  I enjoy complimentary ingredients and they seem to have their shit together.  The burger with pineapple and bacon was just the perfect amount of sweet and salty - I may get it another time.  I wasn't too in to the burger with gouda but I bet you would be if you like that sort of thing (I just don't really).   Even though the restaurant was completely full, the service was attentive and friendly - that's all I ask for in a server, really.  There was a lot going on but she managed to refill my diet Coke whenever I needed it, so big ups to her on that.  Really, I have to give Kuma's 5 stars for knowing how to put together a burger.  They know how flavor works and what goes well with what.  Through I've only tried one burger, I can imagine that they others are just as delicious (if not more) than the one I tried.  I look forward to going back and sampling more, especially now that I know it's so close to my house I can bike in about five minutes!  Thanks, Kuma's.",0.999,0.768,0.204,0.028,0.5753215654077725
2009-06-13,5.0,"I know I'm shooting myself in the foot for writing a review here, but they deserve it, and I feel I should give back to the Yelp community. Plus there's so many great reviews already, what's one more, right? I'd consider myself something of a burger connoisseur. Ok, maybe just burger lover. But I can, and have, eaten burgers 3 or 4 nights in a row without getting remotely tired of them, and they're always my standard goto food whenever I go out to eat. So when a friend of mine suggested this place as a good burger place, I was all for it.  First of all, you have to be warned that this place is a heavy metal bar, and they really crank the music. The atmosphere outside during the summer is great, fairly peaceful and spread out. Inside, however, you have to raise your voice to hear yourself talk, and I've been told that later at night they really turn it up. The second caveat is that there will be a huge wait, which of course is only getting worse as more idiots post great reviews on Yelp. You'll wait probably an hour on average, and there's absolutely nothing around here to do. The waiting calms down a bit in the summer, when they open the sweet beer garden area in the back. Having said that, Kuma's Corner has the best burgers I have ever had in my life. Bar none. They're simply amazing. They have like 20 different burgers, all with their own unique twists (and heavy metal band name). Plus a special burger of the month, which I've often found to be a bit off-putting on reading the ingredients, but I've learned to trust Kuma's implicitly with what I put in my mouth. Burger sound a little funky? Mangos on a burger? What? But trust me, just let them handle it. It'll be amazing. And all served on a pretzel roll, which is pretty much the best kind of bun you could possibly have. As if that weren't enough (it is), the fries are great and the spicy ketchup hits the spot. If you're into mayo with your fries, as I am, they have 3 or 4 types of may for your dipping pleasure. Also a decent beer list. And in addition to all that, they've got amazing mac and cheese. With your choice of add-ins. But be careful, that thing is huge. If you try to do it as an appetizer, you better have 5 people there or be ready to take some home. Because you do not want to fill yourself up before the burger. Warning: Kuma's is *very* filling. I always skip lunch before an afternoon here, and often end up on the couch for the rest of the evening. I once came home around 5, fully intending to work out and go to a party that evening. I didn't make it off the couch until I woke up at 10pm and put myself to bed. You've been warned.",0.9983,0.76,0.193,0.047,0.5554820693709582

The craft beers they have are on the pricy side($7 for a 3 Floyds), which probably makes them a lot of money given that you're usually going to order some drinks while you're waiting. Onto the food, which was simply.....orgasmic.  I ordered a 10 oz. burger, with a 1/4 lb. bratwurst on top, with caramelized onions, chutney, and mustard.  It was simply amazing.  I ordered medium rare, and it melted in my mouth.  My friend ordered the basic burger with a fried egg on top and loved it.

Well let start by telling you this isn't your average burger joint you've got your ultra cool servers with all their tats and piercings and not to mention the dark heavy metal scene in the back round with heavy metal blaring out the speakers. But you will be surprised when your server comes and asks for your order with her new wave punk look they are so sweet (Maybe it's me but I always think they're mad about something) but their really not. Anyways back to the food the real reason were even talking about this place . There burgers are fabulous I've tried the Pig punisher which is a pulled pork sandwich with a cool name and the Lair of the Monitor (not sure that's spelled right) but it was insane I think this burger is like the burger of all burgers and I can say that cause I love burgers and if it was my last day on earth I would beg for someone to bring me one I'm not kidding they're that good. And you gotta try their mac 'n' cheese it's awesome. I can't wait to go back. the only bad thing  I have to say about this place is your gonna have to wait a long time before you get your Kumas fix.

However, our server wasn't as cool as usual either.  But I imagine it's hard to keep up a fun persona your entire shift when you are running a 2+ hour wait the whole time, so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt.  But you better bring it next time with your typical fun-yet-surly rawk-ness.",0.9754,0.733,0.202,0.065,0.5250641025641026
2009-06-10,5.0,"Today was my 6th visit to Kuma's Corner and it still amazes me how great their burgers are. The key is to go exotic, like the Plague Bringer - jalapenos, pepper jack, garlic, hot sauce, tortilla strips and garlic mayo, all on a pretzel bun.  Or the High on Fire - grilled pineapple, roasted red pepper, prosciutto, chili paste and siracha hot sauce.  But don't forget about the monthly special on the chalk board. You wont be let down if you go basic, like the Kaijo - bacon, blue cheese and onions...but how fun is that? I also suggest making your own mac & cheese for an appetizer.  Stick to 2 or 3 ingredients, anymore can get overwhelming.  Prosciutto and sun dried tomatoes is my favorite so far.

2009-06-07,5.0,I'm not going to waste your time with a long review. All you need to know is that Kuma's is definitively the best burger place in all of Chicago. Try any burger and you're guaranteed to like it. The fries are of the waffle variety and the homemade chips are hot and greasy. Both are phenomenal. The most important to thing to know about Kuma's is that you're going to have to wait for a table... the wait-time is often 2 hours. Try hanging around the bar to snag a stool when one opens up.,0.8786,0.887,0.113,0.0,0.5071428571428571
2009-06-06,5.0,"After reading some one-star rips non-food related, I would like to offer a ""Handbook to Kuma's"" so to speak so you newbies know what you're getting into when you go. As far as the burgers are concerned they are epic, juicy, enlightening and offensive in the best way because they might anger burger snobs. Chapter One You're Going to Have to Wait No matter what day of the week it is, what time of the day it may be, expect to wait. It's better to be pleasantly surprised by a quick seating than not expecting to hear it will take two hours before you see a menu. Try sitting at the bar but that's no guarantee in the least. Chapter Two It's Going to Take Awhile to Get Your Food No matter what you order, it may take about 45 minutes to get the burger. I honestly don't know what takes so long but they are big, thick Angus burgers that would take at least 10 minutes to get to rare on the grill. Chapter Three Go With the Flow Do you like death metal and stoner rock? Kuma's staff really does and no matter what you will have to yell to be heard, especially when they're packed. There are other quirky things you may have to deal with, like when my friend and I found out they don't have ranch dressing (Not that I care). You may not be able to pay with a credit card, so hit the ATM (I don't know this from experience but have heard credit cards are frowned upon there). Your server will like the cash tip better anyway.  You'll have to ask for salt and pepper and the ketchup, I think, is homemade and is not on the table. Your full compliance will be rewarded when your insanely constructed gigantic burger arrives. They have a TV behind the bar but I would not ask to put on ""the game"" because they won't do it. Chapter Four Don't Ask For a Margarita The bar is pretty bare bones when it comes to liquor, just whiskey and beer is the recommendation. They have some good scotch. You'll probably get laughed at if you ask for a mixed drink here. Finally, they do not offer carryout in the summer. These burgers are better enjoyed immediately after cooking anyway. Personal favorite is the Kaijo with crispy bacon, a really intense glob of bleu cheese and frizzled onions. They don't do the fresh cut fries anymore; instead frozen waffle fries. On the bright side they added fresh cut pub-chips which looked excellent but I didn't try. Oh yeah and for those with families and little kids there are some naked boobies on the wall so be aware.",0.9939,0.77,0.162,0.068,0.5710227272727273

As Michael S. stated (my roommate), I enjoyed the following: The Slayer - Waffle Fries topped with Burger topped with Cheese Topped with Chili Topped with Spicy bell Peppers topped with other stuff... no bun.  While rated by Food Network (psh) as the best burger in IL, I found myself enjoying my other roommate's burger better.  Don't get me wrong, the ingredients are fresh and the burger is monstroustily delicious, but the missing pretzel bun actually meant a lot more to me than I thought it would.  I don't think I'd order it again, but I did enjoy it. Mac and Cheese with Prosciutto and Red Peppers - This was good.  We had waited 45 minutes at 11 PM on a Tuesday night to get in, and this was an excellent starter for the six of us.  Again, if you're getting burgers, you don't need to split the mac/cheese with three.  Split with six.  It was plenty.  It tasted just like my homemade mac and cheese, but slightly lighter... probably one of the best mac and cheeses I've had yet in the city. Jerk Burger - Burger with pulled pork, jerk seasoning, fried plaintain chips, mango slices.  This was really phenomenal.  The sweetness of the ingredients was an excellent balance to the burger, and honestly eating half a burger along with the mac and cheese and some fries was enough it seemed.  I would definitely reorder this, if there wasn't 6 more burgers on the menu I'm still dying to try. Verdict - I would love to go back.  The long line, definitely makes me think twice about coming back here (45 minute wait on a Tuesday night at 11 PM?  Geez!) but the quality, price, and even the customer service  was phenomenal!  I'll be sneaking my way back in due time...",0.9957,0.785,0.186,0.029,0.4196759259259259

I came on a Saturday afternoon (4pm) hoping to miss peak time but had to maneuver around a crowd of people to get inside.  Okay, so maybe it's peak time all day on the weekends, but I expected that.  I stood awkwardly for a few minutes wondering if this place had a waiting list when the host approached me to ask for a name.  He said it was going to be over an hour wait for a table.  I looked around and noticed that there were people coming in for pick up orders so I asked if we could just do a carry out and he said we could place our order with the bartender.   We  waited 5 minutes before we could get the bartender's attention only to be informed that we had to order by the kitchen area in the back.  Ugh, so I had to maneuver my way through more crowds of people and place my order in the back end of the bar.  We returned to the entrance and waited by the window since we saw people picking up food order from there.   Waited...and waited..and waited...it was so hot inside since they had an open kitchen and tons of people waiting around.  I've never felt so awkward in a bar/restaurant before and I really couldn't wait to get out of there.  The music was loud and obnoxious and made me glad I wasn't eating in.  Then I noticed a bag at the end of the bar, but wasn't quite sure if it was my carry out since nobody informed me it was ready.  So 1/2 an hour after placing my order, I walk to the back to inquire if our food was ready and sure enough, the bag was mine. They didn't bother to pack any napkins or utensils, so I had to get creative about cleaning up after such a messy meal.  Hey, sometimes, that's what jeans are for, right? Would I come back?  Normally, I wouldn't let terrible service get in the way of amazing food...but this was just a terrible personal experience.  This bar is too cool for this cat.",0.9915,0.793,0.148,0.059,0.6028373015873014
2009-05-19,3.0,"OK, not that Kuma's Corner needs another review, but I went there recently after hearing the hype.  The burger was good (I had the basic Kuma burger), the wait was long and the music was so-so.  I tried the Great Lakes Brewing Co.  Edmund Fitzgerald beer and it was good. Reminiscent of Guiness in a way.  I'm no beer expert but I know what I like and don't like.  I understand that Miller products or Bud products aren't everyones favs, but they are popular in Chicago, so I don't get why they're not served here, unless its to push another expensive micro-brew.  All in all, I would go back to Kuma's.

2009-05-19,1.0,"Before you go ape-s#@t on my 1 star review of this well-hyped hang-out, please read this entire review. I would love to give Kuma's Corner 5 stars and talk on-and-on about how great their food is, or how edgy their ""dive bar"" vibe is....but I couldn't even make it to my meal to do so. Long story short.....not trying to flame anyone, but their hostess on Tuesday night....a roller-derby girl named Vanessa (she lied when I asked her her name...calling herself Lisa) is undoubtedly the worst hostess in any restaurant in town. She was rude to everyone, incompetent in her work-manner especially in a high-traffic restaurant like Kuma's, and like I said before a liar (who does that? giving a fake name to a face-to-face customer?) I would give Kuma's a higher rating because our server was really nice (Chris? - for the 5 minutes I sat down for - before Vanessa/Lisa actually came up to me and challenged me to speak to her manager - no joke) and the manager that i did eventually talk to was really nice as well (thanks Seth?) Just sucks that I couldn't even stand to finally eat at Kuma's because I waited for soooooo long and put up with that hostess' bulls@#t demeanor. I guess I just won't ever eat there if she's working there. Oh and btw.....it was so bad that I actually signed up to use Yelp just to let y'all know what's up.

2009-05-07,3.0,"Perhaps if I didn't have to spend over an hour on the CTA to get to Kuma's I would like it more. Or maybe if there wasn't this crazed hype about how wonderful this place is? I haven't really decided yet. Still, I did like how we did not have to wait for a table. 2 tops are miracles sometimes. Tables for 4 had a 35 minute wait... suckers (with friends to dine with). Being antisocial does have its perks after all. :) I also like how they have Baby Cham (a sparkling pear cider from England) on their drinks menu. I used to buy this stuff from the supermarket in Hong Kong and drink it chilled. So delicious. This is the first time I've seen it in the US.  Once inside, I started to form opinions. The place is a lot smaller than I thought it would be and MUCH smokier, as in, I can't see the end of the room smoky. There were heavily inked waitresses (who were nice) and plenty of dudes, many that came in larger sizes with backwards baseball caps, talking in loud volumes in between bites because they had to, because the metal playing was pretty loud too. So even though this isn't my ideal dining environment I was willing to wait to try the burger before passing full judgment. I ordered the Kuma burger, medium rare, with a side Caesar and Mr. N got the Mastodon with waffle fries. The salad was small but perfectly dressed with their house-made dressing - no soggy leaves here. Now coming from someone who loves a good burger but hardly ever orders/eats them, Kuma's does a terrific burger. The actual patty itself is juicy and well seasoned. Sandwiched between a pretzel bun with bacon, cheddar, and a fried egg? Even better! Mmm, runny egg yolk and juicy burger = hot delicious mess. The waffle fries I stole were good, a little under seasoned, but nothing that wasn't fixed with some of their ketchup.  So yeah, I did eat a great burger at this place and will return in the far future because there are others I want to try. Actually, it's probably my favorite burger in the city. However, I'm not sure if I would rave about it like a lunatic. Maybe if they served these burgers in a different setting, but then that would be taking away the charm of this place right? I wouldn't really miss it much though, except for maybe the pin up girl wallpaper in the bathroom.",0.9958,0.787,0.176,0.037,0.604435626102293

Avondale is pretty much in the Belmont ghetto. Think ghetto blue line, head waaaay east on Belmont. When I got off the el, I was surrounded by consignment stores. And with my better judgment, I (thankfully) decided to take a bus. It really doesn't get any less ghetto on your way to Kuma's after this. I put my name on the list, and then I wait. And I wait some more. The wait really is an hour, no less. No reservations. Unless you feel like waiting for a seat by the bar, which typically accomodates just you and a friend. Take out is an option as well. Then, expect another long wait for your food to come out.  BUT THEN....expect the burgers to be really as good as everyone says it is. That's right...where else can you find juicy 10 ounce burgers? Toppped with siracha sauce, and proscuitto?

Are waitress was never around yeah sorry we didn't order drinks still take care of your customers. Our burgers come out, my fries were perfect crispy the way I asked. Then one bite of my burger wtf its a crispy layer on the top of it, then another no this taste char burnt that's not right. I turn to my boyfriend, baby is this normal? He yells hell no that's char burnt I say yeah I always order it in the 2years we've coming here its never been like that. Excuse me I tell the new girl since our waitress was on the side of the bar, btw the waitress I told she was so attentive to us even though we had another waitress I believe her name was winnie? I told her about my burger and she goes yeah your right let me tell the chef. Well chef Amilia claimed well done was suppose to be CHARED as shit and crispy and leave an after taste such as burnt in your mouth. After 2years of comming here and ordering all my burgers WELL DONE they never turned out like that. Is it that they don't like to be wrong? But please Customer is always right in some cases an this was one of them. I will come back even though todays burger sucked and they agreed to make me a new one and the new one came out good but the fries weren't crispy and our waitress didn't even bring out my 2nd burger but Winnie did and she was great and I hope next time I go I get her she was so attentive.

For our ""Goodbye For Now, Sweet Kuma's"" voyage we went with classics and had the Mastadon, the Kuma burger and an order of Mac and Cheese with bacon and prosciutto.   That being said, order freely here as everything designed to be put in your mouth - from the beer to the food - is delicious on a fairly epic scale.  Burgers, as usual, were cooked to order, the meat juicy and carefully spiced, the bacon, the cheese, everything, absolutely top notch.  Honestly, it's hard to go wrong with anything that has a fried egg on top.  Mac and cheese was ambrosial and the waffle fries were well seasoned, hot and crisp.   Service here is perpetually terrific - our waitress hustled out some Cholula with the mac and cheese without me even having to ask.  Little things like that make me happy and the staff here are truly professionals. So, let the DD&D effect take place, for now,  I have the memories of one last amazing burger at the incomparable Kuma's.  This isn't goodbye, Kuma's, not by a long shot.  I'll be back in a couple of months when the patio is open, the tourists have thinned out a bit and the leering visage of Guy Firei is but a dimly recalled memory.",0.9902,0.781,0.167,0.053,0.6290178571428571

Kuma's burgers are among the most creative I've ever seen on any menu, and they have a great selection of draft beers, but there isn't really anything here to convince me to come back. $12 for a burger. Sure, it will be one of the more unusual burgers of your life, if you don't cook. If you DO cook, you can take the same fixin's and make a tastier meal at home for a third of the price. Kuma's looks great on paper, but when you actually get down to the food itself, it's just not good enough to justify the high price. The beef itself didn't seem to be very good quality and was tough and overcooked. Part of the risk of eating at such a busy place, I suppose. Speaking of busy, I won't complain about the wait. I'm glad Kuma's hasn't bowed to the increased demand by expanding and turning into another one of those mediocre local chains. I'm glad they're keeping it real.

Once at the bar, our bar tender was very nice but not super attentive.  She would walk over near our end, but then just look past us.  My fried had to wait a very long time to get her first few beers, that gets another 1/2 star deducted.  I ordered the Motorhead....Goat Cheese, Kalamata Olives, Oregano, Tzatziki, Onion, Tomato.  By far, the best burger I've ever had!!!!!  I only wish they had added more Tzatziki sauce.  My friend had the PLAGUE BRINGER with Roasted Garlic Mayo, Tortilla Strips, Chicago CO-OP hot sauce, Fresh Garlic, Pepper Jack, Sliced Jalapenos.  Also very good, just a little spicy.  The food came out probably within 20 minutes of ordering, which was much quicker than I would have expected.

2009-03-17,2.0,"Without question one of the most overrated experiences in Chicago and further proof that, at the upper echelon (of the $10+ sort) of burgers, Chi city is sorely behind LA and NYC. How do I know this, you ask? It took me three different visits to discern. Here's what I know: 1) the patty is too big, made worse by the use of a pedestrian chuck blend instead of a mix of fats and meat. 2) The meat is underseasoned and lacks any distinctive flavor of its own (see above). 3) The toppings are cute but add nothing to the mix; ultimately, the results taste of heaviness and heartburn, and are as about as fulfilling as the lipitor you should ingest immediately afterwards. The beer selection is, admittedly, excellent. The atmosphere is fun...if you can get a seat. But there are few things worth 2+ hour waits in this town--and this ain't one of them. You might as well hop back into your car and head north: Poochies, Wiener and Still Champion, and Paradise Pup all make a superior burger.

2009-03-15,4.0,"THE REVIEW NO ONE WILL LIKE If there was a place that is a victim of making its own slice of hell's heaven, its own quest for excellence, and its own success, it's Kuma's Corner.  After reading all the reviews, one to five stars, I finally got in on one of THE worse weekend days to try the food - the Sunday before St. Pat's Day.  In one of the worse recessions the world has ever seen (i.e. nobody wants to spend any money), this place was packed at opening (line out the door before it opens).  This little bar has some great beer and bourbon selections, great food and is struggling with keeping true to itself, and serving to the great drunken and 'hipster' masses who treat the staff like tattooed servants, rather than the people in your heighborhood that you meet each day working at the corner bar. SLICE OF HELL'S HEAVEN The wait will be long, unless you get there during a weekday, or right when it opens.   And this place is a metal bar with a restaurant.  Metal, meaning if you don't like or know what heavy, speed dealth or black metal is or don't like it, DON'T GO.  And if you do go for the food, DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MUSIC because its a metal bar and they will not play any popular music no matter how many times you wave your money in their face.  If you really want to have a burger at a sell out metal bar, go to Twisted Spoke.   The metal aspect adds to the hipster mysitique.  People who were dragged by their boyfriends, who demand things from people and complain to their buddies\girlfriends behind them about how the service sucks, or who don't tip, think the speed metal being blasted makes this place really cool.  Actually its there to drive out those who don't like the music.  I say, ITS NOT LOUD ENOUGH.  Its like a snuggling up to a knit blanket of razorwire and black leather biker booties. QUEST FOR EXCELLENCE Despite the metallicity, the attention to detail and execution of of drinks and food are what makes this place truly successful.  Drinks are killer.  There are 3 Kentucky Bourbons on tap (Jack Daniels, Woodford Reserve, and Buffalo Trace) - all excellent.  The beers, tap or bottled, are an excellent mix of weiss, amber and porter style beers that are just excellent with any food. The Chef Amalia Obermeier-Smith, and I do say ""chef"", has an excellent touch with the basic Kuma burger.  It is a lean 10 oz burger with bacon, cheddar cheese, a fried egg, bibb lettuce, tomato, onion and served on a pretzel roll.  Burger, medium - excellently cooked, lightly seasoned, but juicy and flavorful.  Egg - sunny side up.  Bacon - smoked peppered, between chewy and crisp. Tomato, lettuce and onion - devoid of water, which actually washes away any flavor on the burger, literally. The caesar's side salad rivaled anything served in any steakhouse, yet this was perfectly executed.  Attention to detail - parmesan, crisp croutons, nice coverage (not drownage) of dressing on lettuce is excellent.  This tells you so much about the attention put into the food. The chili had excellent, greaseless chunks of hamburger, with black and kidney beans, and sprinkled with onions and monty jack cheese.  The heat of the chili is not immediate, but slow and steady, indicating it was cooked over a long period of time, allowing the flavors to merge.   Our server, Rose, was patient, pleasant and got our food and drinks with an almost clairvoyant perception, making sure we were taken care of in the sea of waving $20s.  Of course, us being polite and showing we have manners helps. VICTIM OF ITS OWN SUCCESS With rave reviews in almost every Chicago food publication (it's the EGGS AND BACON, baby), a new website, and more web reviews like this, this place can only go one way - multiple locations, then franchise.  Hopefully the future Lincoln Park and Wicker Park locations will help ease the crowds thronging to the Avondale area.   If not, they will have to crank up the Sepultura on the box that ""goes to eleven"", and keep serving the best to, sometimes, the worse.",0.998,0.805,0.153,0.042,0.5910804473304472
2009-03-12,2.0,"I don't care what the 650 other reviewers have to say. This place, on my one experience, totally blew... in more ways than one. I had heard so much about the 3 hour waits but was pleasantly surprised when we walked in on a Saturday night and got a table in the far corner right away- SCORE! The wait staff is zexy... it does not go unnoticed and I do appreciate that.  I enjoyed the metal music and metal inspired names for burgers but was overall, pretty f***ing grossed out by Japanese psycho horror gore movie on the TV screen. I was facing it and couldn't (though I desperately tried to) look away. The movie was an uber gory and graphic flick where women's breasts were cut off, sewn back together with some sort monster spawn in them then this naked (underage?) girl was giving a gentleman a bj while he was strapped into this weird machine but the wholesomeness of that wore off when she started to eat his d*** and then some guy started drilling holes in him. Oh, and the wiener eater's girly bits turned into a monster that looked alot like Audrey II from Little shop of horrors and the guys severed d*** turned into a giant reddish pink pulsating bleeding machine gun and I'm going to stop now because I'm realizing that this more about the movie but the point is, it was very distracting and a huge part of our dining experience at Kuma's. If you plan on bringing someone under 17 or going with someone who has a weak stomach, warn them. And I'm not easily grossed out but this leads me into the food.  I am a veggie eater (I know, boo on me but in my defense, I love meat, I'm doing it for the environment or some junk so suck it) but my bf is not. He got a burger that he enjoyed (or so he said) but he didn't finish it, not even half. To me, and I know him better than he does, that means he didn't like it but wanted to like it because all his friends would say they liked it. I got a veggie patty on one of the burger options. It took about 45 minutes (of watching someone's d*** get eaten off on their TV screen) before the burgers came out and I liked the fries a little but they were defo nothing to write home about. My burger was not what I had ordered but i didn't say anything because I waited tables for 9 years and it just sucks to go back to the kitchen and say there was a mistake and it was late and I really couldn't fathom having to watch that movie for any longer. I'm confident I still got a veggie patty on my incorrect order because real meat could not possibly have tasted that much like sand... in fact I'm pretty positive they just use the garden burger brand patties which already taste like S on top being freezer burnt 100% of the time. Go Boca or go home. Back to the burger mix up... I thought I was getting something heavenly with avocado and cheese but my burger had no cheese and only some freaking disgusting soggy red pepper slices.... that looked a lot like the horror movie effects from the TV. I HATE soggy pepper slices. Nothing is grosser than soggy red pepper slices (maybe milk), it looks and tastes like what I'd imagine after birth looks and tastes like... thank you Freddy Got Fingered. I couldn't eat it, just took it to go in hopes that someone in my house would be tricked into wanting it. I believe I ended up throwing it out.  Also, I got a beer that tasted spoiled- is that possible? It tasted like fermented pears or something sweet and rotten. NG= Not good. Maybe I would go back if I were already a little blitzed and didn't have to face some sexy gore fest on TV but I'm defo not craving it while stone cold sober or sane.",0.9944,0.737,0.16,0.103,0.5640431407672789

Listen to metal (both new and classic), try dark beer you haven't heard of or can't pronounce (or order a couple Fin du Monde's like me), talk to your friends. You like these people, which is why you're out with them, so make some conversation. Then wait some more.  Then get seated by an always friendly, almost always inked server, enjoy your beers while sitting, and order a 1/2 pound burger named after a metal band you may or may not be listening to (or have heard of), try a new beer, and wait. And wait. The kitchen is 6' x 16'. It's small. No it's tiny. It's about as big as a dining table, with a few guys maneuvering around eachother, one on the grill, one making steaming Mac & Cheese (with your choice of add-ins), one plating, and servers in and out running drinks, burgers, and calamari.  And the metal is loud. So listen, or talk over it. By now you've had enough drinks to not care.  Your stomach is churning for meat and potato (or the beer is, but at this point they're one in the same). You're drunk. You now love metal. You hated it when you walked in. So did the 40 year old business man at lunch. So did the 60 year old dad dragged by his son. So did the 8 year old kid who loves Big Mac's and chicken fingers. But they all came to Kuma's, and they have all been converted. Expect deadlocks at the office Monday morning.  The food arrives. It's hot. The fries and chips are perfect. The burger is the one burger that you want to go back to when you have the next burger you eat. You compare burgers you ate in the past to this one. You order burgers at restaurants to come, to see if it lives up to what you have already consumed here.  This is Kuma's Corner. They do not eff around. I can still taste the first one I ordered here, High on Fire, even though I've been back countless times, always trying a different flavor of Metal. Always medium-rare. Perfectly medium-rare, perfectly charred, every time.  It's too much to eat in one sitting. Too bad. It's on a Pretzel Roll. It is delicious. It's messy. Sometimes it comes with crab salad on top. Sometimes it has bacon and a fried egg. It is the greatest hamburger Chicago has to offer. The only place that I've ever eaten at that can compare is in Cambridge, MA - Mr. and Mrs. Bartley's (if you're in Cambridge, and you want a hamburger, go there.. Kuma's is too far a trek).

(One would not guess that on first glance since this is not necessarily the most stereotypically ""family friendly"" place out there.)  My only critique is that the music at times can become a bit deafening.  There is only so much heavy metal a person can take -- and for me, 2 hours is the limit.  Outside seating makes this a bit more manageable if you plan on staying a while, but with its recent clientele surge, that may take a while to finagle.

Both times we were quoted 1.5 - 2 hours for the wait, giving in to immediate hunger we bypassed this spot and went in search of a place with shorter wait times....on the 3rd attempt, which was for lunch, we were quoted 1 hour and decided to stick it out this time.

(but still good, don't get me wrong). and lastly- the calamari BLOWS. i think there was a deep fried beak in mine the last time i ordered it. so, i don't really know what to say. i'm giving it 4, because really you can't beat their burgers. i just wish they would expand, so it wouldn't be so crazy and hectic in there. take over the united center or something.  ooh, i should yelp that next.",0.8489,0.854,0.081,0.065,0.44462901439645613

Because yes, there are apparently other weirdos/amazing eaters in Chicago that will want a moist, giant, delicious cheeseburger in the late lunch-early dinner hours. This was the incredibly arrogant mind-set I had when I literally dragged my friend miles across town to go to Kuma's. We walked in and the hostess told us that it was about an hour wait for two people. We decided to stick it out (it was, after all, -10 degrees outside and it had taken us 45 minutes to get there via various buses) and grabbed some beers. About 20 minutes later we were aggressive enough to grab two seats at the bar after some diners got up. At first when the bartender asked us if we wanted to eat there, we said no but after looking around the room and approximating how much longer we had, we decided to just stay at the bar. I must say, if you have the opportunity to just sit at the bar I would highly recommend it. It seemed to me as if they were really giving the larger parties priority in terms of table and there were only 3 tables reserved for two-tops.  I really wanted Mac & cheese AND a burger so my friend and I decided to get the mac & cheese as an app and each ordered a burger as well. The peeps next to us said the sundried tomatoes in their mac & cheese were really really good and I'm not usually a fan but I decided that with bacon and peas it would be a delicious combination. And I am happy to say that I was right. I ordered the burger with pepper jack, pancetta, and jalapenos. I've realized that the thing that makes Kuma's burgers amazing is not the toppings but the bun. The pretzel-bun is so amazingly soft and it soaks up all the delicious meat-juices that run from the medium-rare patty (I vomitted in my mouth a little when I overheard people ordering there's well-done). I finished the entire burger and felt so satisfied that I would have gone back a few days later if it were not for the fact that I could barely pull my pants over my fat ass the next morning.",0.9944,0.824,0.145,0.031,0.48372789115646264

Well, let me tell you without further ado, Kuma's spanked that nellie bitch Mary, and left her crying.

Gone is the co-op hot sauce.  That was impossible to find anywhere else, and made the spicy ketchup so much more.  Hell, the ketchup just tasted like plain Heintz out of a packet.   Gone are the seasoned fries that were actually interesting.  Yeah, waffle fries aren't as bland as plain potatoes, but the magic is gone from them. Gone are the super fresh ingredients that used to be piled high on every burger.  The layer of bacon that used to cover the Goblin Cock is now just a single strip.  The slices of tomatoes were replaced by a handful of diced tomatoes that seemed old and nearly out of a can.  The sport peppers were wilted and sad, like an 80 year old man's...nevermind.  Gone is the huge flavored slab of beef that was the bedrock of every burger.  Whereas the first 5 dozen times I ate at Kuma's, I often struggled to finish my meal, today I ate my Cock, and the last of my girlfriend's burger, and the rest of her fries, and still was hungry. I don't know Kuma's.  It might be you, but it might be me.  All I know is is that this isn't working out between us.",0.9791,0.816,0.121,0.063,0.5464909297052154

2008-12-13,3.0,"With so many wonderful burgers on the menu (most that can be made with a veggie burger instead of MEAT - though this place really worships MEAT, hence the caps) how does one decide on what to get? On the way to the Morning After Trifecta event the morning following the Yelp Holiday Bash 2008, I devised a fun game to decide.  Turn on Liquid Metal, Sirius/XM's all-metal-all-the-time station (or if you're an actual conisseur of metal, just your mp3 player), and the last song that is played by a band who has a burger on the menu, that's the way you order.  Sure it's a chaotic way to decide, but isn't metal about chaos to a point? This time, the winner was Slayer.  When I got there, however, I discovered that the Slayer is one of the only burgers that can't be made vegetarian (note to Kuma's - veggie sausage and veggie bacon are quite tasty) and realizing that I had never gotten the Make Your Own Mac & Cheese that so many people rave (though that's a poor word to use with a metal bar) about, I got that instead.  It was a bit off but I blame my horrible ability to tell what will taste good together way more than the chefs.  Every bite I took without carmelized onions and sun dried tomatoes was incredible! All the previous times I had been there, it has been during the dinner rush.  I had no idea how busy it got at lunch as well.  I thought it would be unmetal to wake up that early, boy was I wrong.  Expect lines just after opening time of 11:30 a.m.   And lunch there was generally a different vibe.  They have the music on quietly and Kuma's without the metal is a pretty tame atmosphere.  Way better for conversing without losing your voice, but it does lose some of the magic.  That, and the incredibly long waits for food are not as much fun without metal in the background. To make up for the lack of music in the restaurant, I blasted the metal station on the way home as well.  The last band I heard before I got home?  Motorhead.  Son of a... That's my favorite burger on the menu.  Bad timing all around it would seem but still a good time.",0.971,0.789,0.134,0.076,0.5501543209876544

If you wait a little bit it can be obnoxious, but when you wait for an hour or more you are bound to come out saying it was worth it. How else could you justify the wait to yourself?

Here's why.  The place. I love the metal/hardcore scene paired with food. I think it's hilarious. Angry music and food (especially meat) just go so well together. I must mention a restaurant/bar in Paris that I adore called Black Dog -   blackdog-bar.com  - there, they actually do an even better job of pulling off the metal theme, because the restaurant is practically in a dungeon. They also have a meat centric menu and also coffin and death themed desserts...It's FABULOUS!  Need I say more? Slayer rocks. Kumas, you do too. Now, the most important part - the food. The burger I got kicked so much ass. My ass. In case you are interested. See, I asked the waitress what was the spiciest burger on the menu and she suggested 'the Plague' so that's what I got. I had a cold that day and I could not taste anything, so i needed something with a punch. With that said, this burger blasted me off to another sensory dimension triggered by jalopenos and chili sauce. The miraculous part was that i felt great after eating it. The heat cleared my nose and my stomach actually responded with ease and thanked me for filling it with such delicious meat and cheese and bread -fyi - the buns they use are pretzel...I'm not exactly sure...however, they are contenders for the best burger buns I have ever had!  All that said, I was happy to have gone to Kumas, but I must say that it was quite a disappointment when I was told we would have to wait 2-3 hours to be seated. I nearly left. If it were not for the tenacity of my friend (Thanks Agnes!) and the fact that a big table before us did not show up, we were seated within 30 minutes.

And so, it comes with great joy that the burgers here are nothing short of fantastic. Grilled to perfection, served on a pretzel bun and dished up with a side of lattice fries, these very literally may be the best hamburgers you've had in your life.  While eating a piece of flesh tastes even better when it's called the Black Sabbath, the burgers here are so extraordinary people would show up even if they were named after boy bands.

2008-10-22,4.0,"Where do I start? The first two (out of three total) times I've gone to Kuma's there's been no wait whatsoever. I attribute this type of luck to the time of day (both times on the weekends, right when the joint opens). Since then, I've made beween 5-6 attempts to get my burger on, but the idea of a 1 hr 45 min wait puts someone who's hungry in a seroius predicament. So if you have your heart set and aren't willing to wait, don't get your hopes up. But tonight, the third visit, I was blessed with friends who were willing to go there and wait the 45 minutes (bonus!) it took to get our table while I ran some errands. As I arrived, we were seated and all hungry enough to not let the host's flappy earlobes effect appetites. The music in there is so loud that you can't hear your fellow dinner companions talk about how buttsex is okay with Catholics. And maybe that's a good thing. I haven't been brave enough to order anything besides the Mastadon. Beef, bacon, chez, frizzled onions, bbq. Throw in a 50 dollar bill and this might as well be heaven in a pretzel roll. Rox was the most excited. She has also made several attempts to enjoy Kuma's but has faced the long waits. I've developed this theory about the wait. It's all about survival of the fittest, because most people have no problem standing around watching others enjoy the delicious burgers as they wait another 2 hours for a bite. I feel like the teasing makes the experience all the more special. And the fact that Kuma's consistently has a wait has no effect on how the waitstaff behaves. They are just lovely, even though they know they're doing you a favor, not the other way around. This place will be in business forever. Rox received her burger and literally reacted like she's never eaten before. No, she didn't start chomping frantically, but took her time. Each bite was like velvet -- she was sinking her teeth into pure platinum. She bulged her eyes, bit through the deliciousness, wiped her chin and looked at me like she was just reborn as she chewed. She was simply amazed that food could taste that good. We didn't need conversation anymore. Conversation would only distract her from the most glorious burger she's ever laid eyes on. And, no joke, even after every morsel was consumed, the bitch smelled her hands. As for me, that meal was so good I nearly fainted. Literally. I had to concentrate to prevent it from happening. All the blood was rushing to my stomach. That's a serious signal that it was either a good meal or you have a health problem. Whatevz.

I had been to Kuma's quite a few times before, but as a vegetarian-at-least-while-sober until recently, I had only had the veggie-burger and portobello permutations of their wonderful, creative concoctions nestled within that heavenly pretzel roll. I had tried the mac and cheese, some of the best I've eaten anywhere. I had enjoyed their beer selection, even though they are invariably out of the first variety I settle on. But I had no idea what this place was really about until I tasted the real deal: Kuma's beef patty. Set aside for a moment the mind-boggling array of truly gourmet toppings, which I won't rehash here. You could build an empire on the patty and the pretzel roll alone. The meat is subtly peppery and oozes with succulent juice, standing well on its own without interfering with whatever junk you're throwing on top of it.  During my lengthy menu deliberation, I talked myself back from diving mouth-first into a meat canyon such as the Led Zeppelin (topped with pulled pork, bacon, cheddar, and pickles) and went with the more reasonable Iron Maiden (avocado, cherry peppers, pepper jack, and chipotle mayo). I had tried it previously with a veggie patty, but this time there was no comparison. The meat elevated the burger from a tasty but benign sandwich to a transcendent gut bomb. With each bite, the flavors of that burger--I now understood, the burger it was meant to be--mingled and danced on my tongue, then body-slammed my esophagus, taking me on an exhausting journey that left me with a startling new perspective on what a burger could be. It's worth every second of the infamous wait, which I've never found as bad as everyone makes it out to be anyway.

We told our most awesome waitress, Meagan, about the incident, and she just shook her head and said that wasn't right.  Much to our surprise, Meagan returned to our table a few minutes later to tell us that our hostess with the leastest had just quit and walked out.  The tables broke out in a riotous cheer of  ""HA HA, AWESOME!"" It will remain one of our highlight stories of the trip.  Our server was rad, the food was fantastic, and we ALL agreed that we'd hit up a metal burger again if we were in town.  HAIL KUMAS!

After months of asking if I could tag along on one of his fateful trips, we hit up Kuma's on a rainy weeknight a few weeks ago.

As I've been on a bit of a fancy french fry bender, I came here with just one mission - to acquire famed ""Pork fries"".  And they were very good.  Fries were made freshly from real potatoes and adequately covered with sweetly saucy globs of pulled barbeque pork and then coated with melted Monterrey Jack cheese.  Very nice.  The fries were a great mix of crispy and kind of soggy and held up well under all of the delicious gunk.  But for $10? I don't know...I think I'd love em more, maybe even crave them if they were more like $7, maybe even $8.  In fact, even though the burgers looked and sounded delicious, the combination of the hefty prices with the loud, but teeny bar environment probably wouldn't draw me back.  But, admittedly, hearing the loud and angsty retches from hell's minions isn't really my vibe.  Seems like for the cost of $12 burgers, eh....The people behind the bar though were total gems, totally checking on everybody, making sure people had what they needed and working real hard - nothing more could be asked of them (except to turn that fucking racket down - Wait!

My friends and I discussed what I was going to have.  Ever since I came here long long ago, I've wanted to get the Mac and Cheese with everything in it and call it a Suicidal Tendencies.  So I ""man up"" and tell my friends that I am going to order a $21 plate of mac and cheese.   You only live once my friends... My friend, Leah, gets this look on her face that combines the best aspects of revulsion, morbid curiousity, and amusement.  She then hypothesizes that Kuma's may not do all of the toppings at once.  I consider this.  Then I counter-hypothesize that they may.   Life is too short to doubt your mac and cheese my friends... The waitress comes.  She's cute, not wearing a bra, and looks suitably confused, aghast, and amused when I order.  She has to see if the kitchen can do it, as no one has ever been bold (or stupid) enough to order a mac and cheese with everything.   She returns and informs us that the kitchen can indeed prepare a plate of mac and cheese with all the trimmings.   THE CROWD GOES WILD! Well, not really, but I was very, very happy.  So Leah, her man Dave, and I sit in eager anticipation of our meals.  And when they come the burgers are the same great Kuma's burgers that we've all come to know and love.   But my plate of Mac and Cheese dwarfs all the other dishes of Mac and Cheese in existence ever.  This is the Mt Everest of cheese and noodle goodness!  I know looking at it, that I'll never finish it in one sitting, but that doesn't stop me.  I've got twenty minutes to gorge until my stomach tells my brain to stop eating.  I begin excavating this plate of deliciousness like Indy and Sala in Tunisia. And it's heaven.  Smoky bacon and prociutto, a sharp herbal Andouille sausage all complement a collection of veg.  Sweet roasted red pepper, sun-dried tomatoes and crispy broccoli dance like a delicious Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers across the dance floor that is my tongue.  I get a little over a third into it when I know that it's over.  But like Apollo Creed fighting Ivan Drago, I don't want to throw in the towel.  I can DO IT!  I can finish it!   Except I can't.  And there's always breakfast... So if you are bold enough to try the greatest Mac and Cheese in the world.  Make the trip to Kuma's and order the ""Suicidal Tendencies"".  They'll look at you funny and tell you it's not on the menu.  Then tell them that you want the Mac and Cheese with all of the toppings.   Just don't eat for two days prior.",0.9965,0.78,0.167,0.053,0.5767676767676768

The waitress we had was lovely and polite and fit in well with the rest of the waitstaff (all of whom gave the impression that the place only hires ex-Gods-Girls or Motley Crue roadies).  Before even getting started on the food, one must take a quick look over their beer selection. They have bottled beers ranging in price from four dollars to twenty-five -- including the usuals, and old favorites not readily found at every bar (like four kinds of Great Lakes and three kinds of Unibroue). The drink list is also amusingly finished off with great drinking quotes. Their menu is a meat-eaters delight but also starts out with some interesting salads (...which is what I ate. I know I'm a pussy). Their Mesclun greens with goat cheese, cranberries, and toasted walnuts was decently delish -- I've had better, but I have a feeling they're not putting much effort into the salads when they have to dedicate to much attention to their MEAT. There's a specialty burger for everyone, named and dedicated to old favorites from the music industry, like the Slayer, which is topped with anger.  The second time I visited I had the Judas Priest (but with a veggie burger, which they kindly enough obliged) and have been craving it ever since. I mean that. I've tried to clone it at home but to little success. Sigh. They also have very fancy fries a pulled pork sandwich which is sweet and salty and served on warmed and eggy pretzel bread. Nums!

It's ALWAYS crowded, and it's a testament to their mindblowing hamburgers (amongst other specialties). You're going to wait at least 40 minutes for a table and then at least another 30 for your food after you order it (possibly due to black magick being performed on each individual burger to ensure you fall under the Kuma's Spell). There's a bartendress there that really sucks at pouring. I am sorry but I am not going to pay $4-8 for a draught beer and get an inch and a half of head on it. Sample one of their delicious bottled beers as a precautionary (they've got a few really dece IPAs), because chances are you can go to any other bar with the same draughts and get little to no head (heyo!). I've only sampled the delights of two burgers from Kuma's the YOB and the High on Fire. I'm an absolute sucker for Sriracha garlic chili sauce, if it asked my hand in marriage I would surely say yes despite my intestines objections at the altar.  Last time I was there my friend and I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Cheese Fries. Are you F-ing joking me? You don't even know how good that is. We left absolutely nothing on that plate. NOT A CHIVE! The BBQ pork was perfectly sauced, not too much and not too little same goes for the amount of cheese. Dare I say that it's the number one fryppetizer in Chicago? So far, yes, I haven't been around much.  And that High on Fire? Yeah, you can bet your ass they probably put crack in there. MELTS in your mouth, not overwhelmingly spicy like I was afraid of. You know what's more? There isn't even CHEESE on that burger and it still blows your mind. I'm not joking you, it's possible to enjoy a delicious burger sans cheese! My friend and I go always with intentions of splitting everything. Because I don't think there's any way I could eat an entire 1/2 pound mana from heaven burger alone WITH fries and beer.

We settled in and perused the menu.  I decided on the Kuma burger (beef, egg, bacon, cheddar...ie heart attack on a plate) and my bf got the Neurosis (beef, two cheeses, mushrooms and grilled onions).  We also shared a bowl of chili.  The special that month was a burger with a bratwurst and sauerkraut on top of it. I like brats, being as I spent a good part of my life in WI, but really that's too much meat for me!   I was impressed with the amount of people working there.  Someone would walk by and get drink refills, other people were taking orders.  IT was like a well-oiled machine.  I noticed on their ""chalkboard"" above the bar that the bartenders were going to donate all their tips after 6pm, on the last Friday in July to the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans.  What a great idea!   The bowl of chili was huge and hot--in both definitions of the word.  It was pretty spicy so I could only eat a little bit of it, plus I needed to save room for my massive hamburger.  Really, calling the hamburgers at Kuma's such doesn't do them justice.  They are more like beef creations.

It's a pretty small place and is filled with the smoke and essence of grilling burgers (note: you will smell like food when you leave). We went here at about 3:00 on a Friday and we had to wait for a table - only about 20 minutes though. We sat outside which is nice, but you don't get to hear the music, that kind of sucks. The wait staff are all really nice and have lots of nice tattoos. The reason I give this place three stars, rather than say, four or five is because it took us a long time to get our beers (it's a small place too, so I don't get it) and we all ordered our burgers medium and they were all well done (I peeked around at all the tables around us having burgers and theirs looked consistently well done, too). My burger, the Led Zeppelin (burger with pulled pork, BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese and pickles on an amazing pretzel roll) would have been awesome if the burger wasn't so dry. So, I'm not sure if it was the particular cook that day who had no clue how to grill a burger to temperature or if that is just how the burgers are there.

It was full, but there were not a lot of people waiting around for tables to open or anything like that. Normally I would have been fuming mad about this and left, but I was working my way through one beer after another and didn't really notice that the food was not there. My friend and I were on beer number 4 or 5 when we finally started to realize just how much time had gone by since we ordered. We arrived around 9pm and ordered two burgers and they came out with the burgers at 10:30pm.  It wasn't a big deal last night because like I said, I was drinking beer and having a good time. But sitting here this morning and re-thinking last night's events I'm finding it hard to believe that it took that long. I remember asking a guy at the bar next to me if he had ordered food too and he said, ""yep over an hour ago but it always takes that long"".  Here's the thing though, the burger was SO damned good that it almost makes up for the long wait. Seriously, it's close to one of the best damned burgers that I've ever had! So, I have mixed feelings. If you don't mind waiting for well over an hour and listening to really loud metal for a REALLY good burger, then by all means go to Kuma's Corner and give it a try.",0.9857,0.788,0.15,0.062,0.43571428571428567

Yes, I ate an entire burger at Kuma's. I don't think I've ever done that before. The devil made me do it, but it was GOOD. I don't think there could be a bad burger here. I got the Judas Priest the last 2 times, which is a lovely  marriage of red meat, cured meat (bacon), cheese, and fruit. I wanted the Minotaur, which is another variation of said combo (pears, caramelized bacon, brie cheese, and pancetta), but they were out. :( So I went with the Japanese version - wasabi. eggplant, terayaki and other Asian influenced items. To my surprise, it was seriously good as well. But the fries majorly sucked. What's the deal with the soggy fries? EW. I don't care how great the burgers are, they lost a star for the fries. And ladies, please resist the urge to throw paper towels down the toilet when the toilet paper has run out. Clogged toilets aren't appetizing.

2008-07-07,4.0,"I have been going to Kuma's regularly since they first opened and they have, in my opinion, the best burger in the city. It's unique to see such a wide variety of high quality burger toppings that you can get. I suggest you start with the traditional ""Kuma Burger"" the first time you go there, then branch off from there.  You can get any ""burger"" with either beef, chicken or a veggie-patty. I tried the chicken once, didn't like it too much and have stuck with the beef.   Ask for the ""co-op hot sauce"" to go with your food, it's really good and taste good on the burger and the fries.   EDIT: They no longer carry co-op hot sauce :( I like the fries better then the chips or salad (salad is an extra $2 last I tried). However, they have changed the fries a couple times over the years and the current waffle fries are not as good as the old fries, or the original sweet potato fries. There are not many other food options at Kuma's, besides the really great macaroni & cheese (try this someone, you won't regret it), or the Hate Beak buffalo chicken sandwich which is also wonderful but not as good as the Metallica, which is the buffalo-wing sauce & blue cheese burger. Keep in mind, the burgers here are huge. I have seen two people split a single burger for dinner. Last but not least, they have a great beer selection although they often run out of some types. If you like shots, ask about the ""Shot Bot"". So why am I giving Kuma's Corner only 4 out of 5 stars? That's because Kuma's used to be better before they were featured on local television and now the place is always jammed and has become trendy. Although it's still very good, the atmosphere of the place has changed for the worse.

Kuma's Corner is a heavy-metal bar, graced by perpetually-peppy waitresses who look like they could kick your ass if you told them you didn't like Slayer. They're awesome, awesome people. Bondage art, tattoo catalogs, and various metal references adorn the walls. This place has attitude. I'm probably not cool enough to go there as often as I do. I go there on a bi-weekly basis to try to conquer the menu, and to sample the monthly burger (a burger with foie gras, for instance). It's never disappointed, and I'd gladly wait an hour to get in for a Lair of the Minotaur.",0.9906,0.768,0.207,0.025,0.6609693877551022
2008-06-20,4.0,"I'd greatly desire to return here to try and swipe a patio table.  My first experience was very good, delicious and inventive food, fine and suitable drink selection, great service and all... but the music they so mercilessly pipe through the speakers into that little chamber is sheer misery to the ears, straight from the bowels of Odin or whatever.  I can't stand it, and when it comes to music in public places I can abide almost anything.  Now, they can play whatever they please of course, and I could have found out this was a metalhead haunt before going in, but this is largely a subjective thing, and I can only measure the joint by what pleased me, and what detracted from my experience, so there it is. I had the mussels and the Melvins burger (Prosciutto, Mozzarella, Tomato) which aside from the patty being nice didn't work tremendously for me as a totality, but I knew it was a mistake almost as soon as I ordered it, keen as I was to avoid the more obvious selections, which all looked excellent.  My wife's was a chili dish I think, and that was tasty, as were my mussels in the Allagash white ale, I always love to mop up my mussel sauce with bread, but this was especially pleasing. In fact... maybe I can come around to the metaller point of view after all, if it can produce this sort of fare, or maybe they can franchise into Kuma's Prog, Kuma's Chanson, Kuma's Bossa Nova and so on... we shall see.",0.9836,0.791,0.159,0.051,0.6920238095238096

But all of these things somehow meshed together in the best way possible. Our waitress was an absolute sweetheart and came by a couple times just to chat. The music which at first seemed a bit abrasive became totally tolerable and welcome after two very stiff vodka soda pineapples (my current drink of choice). But getting down to business: Like it I did. In fact LOVED it is much more appropriate. And I'm not the biggest veggie burger fan. Theirs however are of the best I've ever had variety- made on location out of fresh produce. Their buns are also awesome- buttery challah buns that melt in your mouth.  After much deliberation I ordered the Iron Maiden and was not disappointed- a veggie burger topped with avocado, cherry peppers, pepper jack cheese, and chipotle mayo- it was freaking incredible. I decided to pay an extra $2 for a side house salad and was very glad I did. Their basil vinaigrette is one of the most surprisingly tasty and strange dressings I've ever had. IT RULES!

The pretzel buns are awesome, the meat is top quality, and all the different types of burgers are so freakin' good! Also I loved the fries, even though my friend's were a bit too salty. I totally enjoyed the Pig Destroyer pulled pork sandwich that I got and it was a nice alternative to the burgers everyone else had. The only downside is the price is a little more than I would prefer, making this place a special treat instead of a regular hang out. The only ridiculous thing about the back patio is that the two tables closest to the door have signs taped to them saying they are ""no smoking"" tables but then right next to them people are sitting there smoking. I understand that some people like to have a cigarette after a meal but it's still rude when people right next to you are trying to eat, and when there's a family on the other side with small children. Can't they wait until they're walking to their car? sheesh. That's just my little gripe for the day.  BACK ON TOPIC: The atmosphere of Kuma's Corner is awesome and the waitresses are nice and cute.

They were both melt-in-your mouth good, with the beef being a ""perfect pink medium"". They come on this pretzel bun, which was soft and chewy and on the side you get a choice of fries or chips. We chose the fries, which were pretty good! The portions are also huge, so you may want to split a burger with someone or take home some yummy leftovers. There were so many other burger varieties, named after the classic metal bands like Slayer, Metallica and Judas Priest, that looked delicious!

So, in short - Kuma's is a place where I can try a new tasty beer, with an amazing burger, at 1am, outside on a patio.  Life can't get much better then that....  and to think, the contrarian in  me was dying to HATE this place based on the hype...  Silly rabbit.",0.9865,0.68,0.248,0.072,0.605166572557877

We waited 1.5 hours for a table here, something I expected.  I ordered their signature ""Kuma Burger"" - beef, cheddar cheese, crispy bacon, and a fried egg (which absolutely belongs on a burger!).  The beef patty was thick and juicy and cooked perfectly medium.  I could taste the fat in the burger but wasn't overwhelmed by the greasiness.  Best of all, it all comes in a pretzel roll - the #1 reason that I heart Kuma burgers. Service is great once seated.  Waitress was friendly and made sure to check to on us even though it was super busy.  My only complaint is that they play music so loudly that it makes it almost impossible to hear across the table - I think because they want you to eat and get out of there ASAP. I was defeated after half a burger.  I blame the large frozen concretes we had at Scooter's during our wait for Kuma's.  That's how we roll.  Btw, Scooter's concrete-of-the-month is PB&J - delicious, but nothing can replace the strawberry concrete.

Even early on a Sunday evening you would have thought the hipster convention just let out and flooded Kuma's mass exodus style. I guess it's always like this in the Corner which comes as no surprise with food like this... but if you mind a wait pressed up against greasy walls, get there super early or way late or just put and up shut up because these burgers are gonna take you on a magical, mystery tour.

Yes, the music is intense, but after an adjustment period (aka a few beers) you find yourself head banging along and drumming with your silverware. When in Rome, ya know?

This place was such a surprise as I had never heard of it before until my friend claimed that it was ""the best burger I've ever had in my life."" Okay, when somebody makes such a cavalier declaration, I'm always very suspicious. Can it possibly be THAT good. I must admit - it was.  These are the gourmet and upscale burgers that Rockit's Bar and Grill downtown wish they could make. It was so hard picking which burger to choose as they all had such unique and intriguing topings. I settled for the Lair of the Minotaur: caramelized onion, pancetta, brie, and bourbon soaked pears. I believe the pretzal bun is what ties these burgers together. It's the perfect touch. Aside from the burgers, each comes with a side of fries or potato chips. I tried both, and they were delicious and tasted freshly seasoned straight out of the deep fryer. Also, my three friends and I split one serving of mac & cheese with sun-dried tomatoes and bacon (everything is better with bacon). While I couldn't really taste the tomatoes, that was some gooey goodness and the perfect prelude to our burgers. We decided that next time we'll just order double bacon. The only think you have to look out for is the long wait. We got there at about 8 pm, and we were told the wait would be an hour and a half. We were determined to try these burgers, so we waited. We ended up getting our table after half an hour, but there was a party of six that had been waiting for much longer.

2008-03-13,4.0,"At one time the words ""Slayer"" ""Metallica"" and ""Iron Maiden"" were simply associated with long hair, wailing guitar solos, and those guys you knew in high school that were in a metal band and constantly smelled like weed.  While these associations still hold true, there is another contender in the race - huge fucking hamburgers. As it turns out, Kuma's Corner is a tiny, yet bustling hub of burger-goodness, with the majority of burgers named after metal bands.  Sandwiches range from the simple-but-incredibly-satisfying Mastodon (BBQ Sauce, cheddar cheese, bacon, and frizzled onions) to the less traditional, more peculiar Judas Priest (Bacon, bleu cheese dressing with apples, walnuts, and dried cranberries).    Salads, appetizers, and choose-your-own-adventure-macaroni are also available, but I always get a burger because I'd feel like less of a man ordering anything else.  Vegetarian options available if you are a sissy and/or care about your body. While the beer selection isn't quite Hopleaf-calibur, there is a surprisingly large variety of tasty treats, including selections from Two Brother's (yay local breweries).  For those of you that aren't fond of dropping big bills on something you're gonna slam and then piss out later, they also have a wide selection of PBRs. Price range is good considering the value and quantity of food you're getting ($10-12 for burgers).  But be forewarned - you will leave mildly comatose from these burgers kicking your ass so hard.  The only real bummer about Kuma's is that you're pretty much guaranteed a wait for a table, as the seating arrangement leaves something to be desired.  I wouldn't advise coming in groups of 5+ due to only two tables that can fit more than that in the entire restaurant.  If its winter, bring a coat, it gets pretty drafty in there. Bonus points for the benevolent charity work (Friday night bar tips typically go to one of the many hospitalized patrons/friends of Kuma's), but I'm gonna have to go with four stars due to how emo I get when I see other people eating sweet, sweet burgers and I'm sitting around waiting for a table.  Honestly, I don't think I've ever had a better burger in my life and you can tell that the owners/chefs really take pride in their work - I strongly suggest checking this place out unless you listen to Creed.",0.9947,0.776,0.174,0.05,0.5027297895902546

The place is usually packed and we rolled in at 11:00pm on Tuesday night and it was still busy.   I got to hang out with the owner and talk music, touring, Chicago night life, the hard work it takes to run a business, and the cold weather of Chicago, and had a blast.  Alex is a very gracious and generous host and is a musician himself.  You can tell he has a tremendous passion for what he does and it shows!   I am sorry, I now must stop what I am doing and run to Kuma's to try the Slayer burger which I hear can take a few days to finish.",0.9828,0.817,0.132,0.052,0.4771296296296296

My dinner date frequents this spot so we intentionally went late in an attempt to avoid a long wait. It's pretty small inside - a nice long bar area to belly up and then no more than 8 tables, some 4 tops and some 2 tops. Anyway it's loud - mostly metal tunes blasting with the occasional blues song to break up the noise (haha yes I call metal music noise, i can't help it). We sat down after a few minutes and scanned the menu - I mean you pretty much are there to get a burger, so prepare yourself, their slogan written on the gigantic chalkboard behind the bar is ""Eatus Meatus"". If you're a vegan there is customizable mac & cheese that looked tasty, but this joint is all about being a carnivore.  The various burger options are all named after old school hard rock bands - I had the Pantera, my date had Judas Priest. Mine was cheddar cheese, bacon, poblano pepper, ranchero sauce and tortilla strips - I mean, it was so dang good. And humongous - you can't possibly finish the thing. The taste of the actual burger was amazing, like real grilled, spiced-up, legitimate quality beef.  It's no wonder why this place is so packed, you MUST go there and experience for yourself.  And the decor is well done, framed drawings of sexy women posing on one wall, signs like ""Don't just sit there NAG your husband"", on another wall, and the big chalkboard that contains numerous scribbles, one smaller one said ""Die Emo die"" or somethingl like that...funny.

We walk inside, excited to eat the burgers, and walk into a cramped space (with more ppl than what fire safety allows for).  Furthermore, we have to wait a whopping 45-60 minutes!  UGGGGHHH.  I had vowed not to drink, but the wait alone, coupled with the fact that there was no other place nearby to wait (unless you count Burger King or Walgreens), was enough for me to order a Great Lakes White Ale.  The beer selection (bottle and on draft) were pretty good - they are huge supporters of Great Lakes beers.  We also had a Surly beer while waiting at the bar. 75 minutes later.... We still weren't seated, and the crowd wasn't dying down.  We wave down the hostess, and inquire how much longer our wait would be, to which she answered, ""You'll be getting the next open table.""  When the next table opened up, we saw the same hostess seat another party (who had clearly arrived after we did)!!!!!!! We could NOT believe the service.. We asked the hostess (nicely, of course), why we weren't seated, and her response was, ""Ummm.. my Manager told me to seat them.""  We then asked for the Manager, who was just as unhelpful and unapologetic, who simply said, ""They were here before you."" At that point, I was SOOO mad, that I considered leaving, but we had waited SOOOO long (90 mins by now), that I wasn't about to go home hungry.   We finally got a table, and each ordered the Kuma Burger (with the over easy egg and bacon), medium rare.  The burgers came out fairly quickly (maybe they felt bad, or feared a negative review on Yelp).  Fortunately, the burgers were delicious and fair-priced ($10), came on a yummy pretzel bun.  I wish the egg was prepared a little more over-medium, b/c I made the mistake of halving my burger, which caused the runny yolk to permeate my pretzel bun and fries.  I didn't mind the runny yolk, but it just became very messy to eat, and wiping all that runny egg on a black napkin did not make the napkin very pretty.  The burger also came with fries and yummy ketchup - it was spicy and tangy! I couldn't finish the whole thing (it's a 1/2 lb burger), so I took the remnants to-go.

I did ask for medium rare, stressed more towards rare, and it was really more towards medium. Unlike Kiarash Z's,  experience, I would have loved a burger that was unseasoned, so I could taste the meat. Ironically I ordered the Neurosis, so if his was bland and mine heavily seasoned, then consistency may be an issue. All I could taste on the burger was a lot of pepper, and since they pepper the fries it was way too much. Service- Some of the people that came after received their stuff quite a bit before us, so much so that they were leaving after we were getting about finished with our food. The server was pleasant enough, but a bit on the cool side. And ketchup, what is the big deal with that? If they don't have bottles, fine. Then ask the people if they want it when you take there order, not when you drop it off, the obligatory, ""do you want anything else with that?"" Yes, ketchup please. Back she comes with two little plastic cups of ketchup. Well, it was just enough for my burger, my friend had the same issue. So I said, can we have some more, that's not going to be enough. My friend said the same thing, this will do for my burger. She comes back with one little plastic cup. OMG! Is there a shortage of ketchup? An embargo? Is it priced per ounce like gold? Just tell me why, I really want to know.  Air quality- Is the hood over the grill inoperative? The place was smokey with a tinge of grease wafting over the place. We both joked thank God smoking isn't allowed anymore that on top of the grill smell, not a good thought.  My jacket smells like grease, I kid you not.

2008-01-19,3.0,"What can you say about a restaurant that has 200 reviews? (cue theme from Love Story) I missed the Big Yelp Throwdown at Kuma's, so I hit it up with a friend on my own. We got there at the crack of 11:30 on a Saturday, which was a good thing, because by the time we left, it was packed. Service, which I understand can be spotty, was good. There were two servers working, and since only the inside area was open (it's January, fa chriyi), that was sufficient. Our server was properly punky, without being over the top, and knew her beers, which is all I ask. The burgers were good, though not overwhelming. I got the Yob and I wanted it to be ... I don't know ... Yobbier. Smoked Gouda and garlic mayo seems like it would have more kick. The burger was tasty, and certainly juicy, but it didn't kick my ass. Frankly, nothing could live up to the Kuma's hype, so I'm not surprised. The fries were definitely top notch, especially if you like your fries a little spicy. I do. The pretzel bun was a nice touch, and helped soak up some of the burger juice. (Does that sound disgusting?) The food came out pretty quickly, which is not completely surprising considering that the place was less than half full. But the kitchen is tee-yini, so the fact that they get any food out of there at all is a miracle. If I lived in the hood, I could see stopping in Kuma's pretty regularly.

The food, has been a hit and a miss for me though.  My burgers rarely ever come out medium, a big annoyance for me.  Sometimes their burgers are juicy and flavorful, but sometimes they're bland and boring.    Sometimes the toppings are all there, sometimes they're actually not.  Sometimes the fries are over seasoned, sometimes the fries are under seasoned, not to mention that sometimes they're cold and sometimes they're not.  I should also say that even when the burgers are a hit or miss, the ingredients are always fresh.   There is always a plus in all of this: the Caesar salad (on the side of a burger) and the calamari. Those two items are never bad and always amazing.  Also the beer list is totally fantastic.

2008-01-15,5.0,"I went to Kuma's last night and after one night, one mean burger, and four great micro-brewed beers, I will go out on a limb and say this is the best restaurant I have EVER been to.   This place might not be for everyone, which is definitely understandable.  You will wait a long time to sit down.  The music is loud.  They play metal and have nude pics on the walls.  It's not TGI Fridays or any cookie-cutter restaurant you could go to anywhere in America.  They're biased when they make decisions like not offering Miller or Budweiser beers and focus solely on micro-brews.  But if you go, go in with a completely patient, open mind and experience WHY the wait is sometimes 2 hours for a burger. This place and the owner spew creativity into their entire menu.  Offering such ridiculous things as a 1/4 lb hot dog as a GARNISH on a burger is pure genius.  As well, putting all of their burgers on pretzel rolls is just phenomenal, I never tasted anything like it.  I had the Pantera burger, 1/2 lb with roasted pablano peppers, tortilla strips, and cheese ranchero sauce...and it was awesome. Being involved with the local metal community, the owner (Alex) is probably the nicest dude I've ever met and loves helping out both his community and local metal bands in Chicago.  They encourage people to go out and attend local meetings and participate in local causes.  They mentioned on the large blackboard behind the bar that they raised $3k for a member of the Windy City Rollers (local all-girl roller derby team) who was involved in a terrible accident.  They really do care about their community and go out on a limb to help them out.  As well, they embrace local metal bands by naming burgers after them (Sweet Cobra, Plague Bringer, Minsk, etc). They're really into their local community, they're really into metal, and they're really into making sure you leave completely mind-blown with the whole experience.  I wish every city in America could have a Kuma's.",0.9915,0.818,0.15,0.032,0.4267290249433106
2008-01-14,5.0,"This place is the shit!!! sometimes i wish that it had opened up a little closer to my house so i could eat there everyday. I've only been there like five times,evenly spaced throughout the years, but get carryout a lot (cause I can't get drunk here and drive home, but looove the food). And I have not been there since it was featured on TV so my review might not be as relevant... First off, I'm impressed by the owner, the concept he was going for and the fact that he stuck with it thoughout some necessary changes. The drink selection is pretty darn good! Unibroue, Three Floyds, Delerium  and Chimay... And the prices range so you will probably find something to drink here, especially if you love beer. there seems to be very strong opinions about everything in this place, and if you are in the food industry you will most likely appreciate some bev.decisions made more than others might.  The service is also fantastic, if you are not sure what to order, there will be someone here to help you. The staff's wine and beer knowledge is incredible and usually your glasses to will be topped off and napkins refolded when you return from the bathroom. I think the owner stole the best of the best staff from around the city when he opened this place, i'm not quite sure who works there now though. You will get pretty close to fine dining service though when the place isn't packed to the gills.  What else? Oh yea, food. wow. I was addicted to the buffalo chicken sandwich at the last place so thank GOD it moved with Mike to Kuma's ((and improved a little)). and the pretzel bun, yum. the real blue cheese, chunky and not full of vinegar. yum yum. i honestly have dreams about this sandwich, no lie. They used to have an extravagant menu that was always executed really well... reminds me that the kitchen knows their stuff. But switching to the all-gourmet-burger last year was a great idea. I mean, what do you reeeeally want at a bar? Yeah, a great burger to compliment your beers. All the ingredients are fresh, tasty--not cheap, and you can order your meat rare or MR without fear of gettin sick. Check the website for a list of burgers. Iron Maiden, Neurosis, Motorhead and especially the Judas Priest have proven to be winners with me. I heard this place has become a circus since, you know. So I suggest if you want to go for the first time, go on a slow day, you know? go a little bit early or later. Don't judge any place when it's packed on a saturday at 8, that's not so fair. Oh and keep a sense of humor about things, Kuma's does. That's why there are pinups in the bathroom and metal on the stereo. It's loud, it's a bar, get over it. Or go for lunch. The atmosphere is homespun, no famous designer, but it's still CLEAN and original. Not what i expected when I heard Mike opened up his own bar. Five stars all the way.

We arrived to a jam packed bar and were prepared to wait the two hours it would take to get a table.  However, we benefited from a small act of the beef gods, when I spotted two lonely chairs sitting at the back corner of the bar.   The menu is exactly what I was hoping for, burgers named after metal bands and great beer!  I went with the Kuma Burger which was topped with Cheddar Cheese, Bacon, a Fried Egg, and served with Fries.  The burger itself was cooked to perfection and the fried egg just worked.  Their burgers are served on pretzel buns and it totally adds an extra level of awesomeness.   This may be the best burger in the city. And the fries are actually really good.   I washed my burger down with a bottle of Commodore Perry IPA and washed it down some more with a bottle of Fuego del Otono from Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Beers.  Jeff had the Black Sabbath which was prepared with Blackening Spice and topped with Chili, Pepper Jack and Red Onion.  Jeff enjoyed his burger as well. The interior is....... It's a bar!  The little stuffed bear (which may or not been real), the porno on the walls, and the metal playing positively contributed to the overall experience.

If your idea of heavy metal involves hairspray, makeup, and silly 80s fashion, then stay away. The first time I went there was plenty of good stuff, including Clutch and Sepultura. Next time, lots of Fu Manchu, with some more doomy and deathy stuff thrown in for good measure.

We took a seat on the patio where there were 2 other tables seated.  It took about 5-7 minutes for our waitress to come by with menus and waters.  She asked us if we wanted drinks.  We declined, but after she listed all beverages they served we felt obliged and asked for a coke and a lemonade.  We ordered two sandwiches...the famous kuma burger (medium) and the motorhead on a chicken breast. While waiting, we noticed that the patio was completely full and there was just one waitress for the area.  She seemed a little stressed and we didn't have our beverages yet. Our meals came out and I have to admit, they were extremely impressive-looking.   We had to ask for the drinks again...our waitress didn't remember what we wanted.  The motorhead was good...HUGE, but definitely good.  Was it amazing?  No.  But it was solid.   The burger (medium) was red all the way through.  Brian was able to have 5 bites before he declared it inedible.  He liked the fries, though.   When our waitress came back to the table to drop off the check, she was crying, which really made me feel badly for her. I know she was doing the best that she could, but there wasn't anyone to help her.  She really was very sweet. Other oddities: **they were out of several things on the menu **they no longer offer sliders, which are still on the menu **the fryer broke shortly after our meal was delivered.  Instead of telling the people and asking if they'd like an alternative to the fries, they just assumed those people would want potato chips Overall, I got the impression that I just wasn't appreciating what Kuma's had to offer.  I'm really hoping it was just an off day.",0.9711,0.803,0.124,0.072,0.4840229885057471

Huh?  Death Metal burger joint? ""You'll see,"" she said. And see I did.  As you've probably already learned from the rest of these reviews, the burgers on Kuma's menu are named after some of the finest proprietors of the rock that is hard ever to grace this blue planet.  I ordered up the Mastodon, and now I crave the bbq sauce covered burger as much as I crave the epic doom sludge of the band. Being a metal fan from way back, I do have to express a small tinge of disappointment that some of the ingredients don't really match the band.  Especially when you order something like say, the Iron Maiden, as a garden burger.  Something about an all vegetarian version of the left hand of the Holy Metal Trinity just didn't sit right with this avid carnivore.  And something about goat cheese and kalamata olives doesn't conjure up the glorious speed metal of Motorhead for me. On the flipside of that argument though, I do appreciate that you can get any burger on the menu as a veggie.  It makes it possible for the girl and I to eat in the same establishment, which ain't easy, believe you me.  And for those of you who dig the bird but not the bovine, you can order up any burger on the menu as a chicken sandwich as well. I've said for years that if you have a gimmick, then the gimmick better be really good and you better be really good at pulling it off, or else you'll just get on people's nerves.  If you're going for style over substance, then make sure the style blows me away.  I can say that Kuma's attempts both and succeeds.  From the helpful and charming tattooed ladies bringing you your food, to the speed metal on the PA, to the old tattoo flash on the walls of the bathroom, Kuma's is as much fun as it is feast.",0.9932,0.774,0.163,0.064,0.5051303854875282

While the bar and patio are overall pretty average, you need to go to Kuma's for THE FOOD! I firmly believe that, if they don't have the best burgers in the city, they certainly are in the top 3 or so.  Giving them metal band names was a nice change of pace. And the ""Make your own Mac & Cheese""  idea is brilliant. You pick from a couple different Mac & Cheese bases, then customize it by adding different ingredients...things like bacon, chicken, broccoli, mushrooms, etc. I haven't been there yet for boozing, but I soon will. The staff is great & oddly friendly. There's nothing I can say that's bad...fast service, cool people, great food.",0.9861,0.724,0.253,0.023,0.6929251700680272

If heaven is half as good a medium rare Kuma Burger, I will be one pleased dead dude. It consists of a half pound of ground chuck, cheddar cheese, bacon, and a fried egg. This burger is not for the cholesterol conscious. The egg is served sunny-side up so the yolk breaks when you take the first bite. It is incredibly juicy and delicious. I ordred the fries, and my wife got the pub chips. The chips are very thin, crisp, and well seasoned. The fries were a little on the soft, soggy side, but they were still very good due to the seasoning. The Judas Priest includes bacon, blue cheese, walnuts, apple, and dried cranberries. Do yourself a favor and skip the tomato on the Judas Priest. It overpowered the other flavors. All burgers are served with a soft, chewy pretzel roll which was highly complementary. It is slighly sweet and quiet good even on its own. It held up well with the juiceness of the Kuma, unlike other buns I have encountered. The beer list is sizable, and PBR bottles are only $2.50. Other beers started at $4.  We sat in the beer garden in the rear of the restaurant. It was quiet but dark. After sunset, our waitress brought out a candle, but it barely illuminated our massive sandwiches. For one of the best burgers in Chicago, Kuma's Corner is a winner.

We got there around 1pm and there were 3-4 other tables there and oddly enough, just one waitress.  I could see that the kitchen was small and very busy.  The beer was good, they were out of Nuts' first choice but his Delirium beer was still very good. I had a tough time deciding but decided to get the Iron Maiden for its avocados and we also ordered the Kuma Original and also the Yob.  We talked and waited and waited.  We saw more people come in and were thankful that we had already ordered.  We waited some more.  After 30 minutes of waiting for our burgers, Nuts asked the waitress how much longer it would be since we were on a time crunch.  She looked up and saw three plates and said ""Oh, look - those might be yours."" Up to this point, we were pretty understanding but to make the story worse...after 45 minutes of waiting on our burgers, these two ladies were served before us.  Now, these two ladies had walked in 15 minutes after us!!! So, Nuts waved down our waitress and asked how long it would be and she said ""Well, we have a small kitchen"" but honestly, that doesn't explain why someone who walked in after us was served before us. Finally, after an hour and 20 minutes of waiting on our three burgers, we finally got it.  We ended up scarfing down our burgers so we could get back to the north burbs on time so I really didn't get a chance to fully enjoy my meal.  I'm sure that the food is great but service was the most disappointing factor in my meal today.  I will not be back again and if you really want something decently quick and you're starving for a HUGe burger, Kuma's isn't the place for you.",0.982,0.825,0.122,0.053,0.5537745098039215

The beer list ranks up there with any of the great import bars in Chicago, and the staff knows what they're talking about.

2006-10-13,5.0,"Kuma's Corner, located on the outskirts of the Roscoe village neighborhood, is in my opinion, one of Chicago's finest restaurant/bars.  The servers and bartenders are some of the finest the city has to offer, friendly and full of drink and food suggestions.  The menu features a broad combination of tasty treats.  I would recommend the ""make-your-own"" mac and cheese, the kobe beef sliders, scallops, and definitely the Kuma Corner burger.  If you are looking for a great place to get a meal or just a drink, Kuma's has what you are looking for.  If the weather is permitting, you should check out their beer garden.    Three Floyd's beer.  Need I say more?",0.91,0.891,0.109,0.0,0.5187499999999999
2006-09-25,4.0,"Been here a few times, as it's right around the corner from my place. If you're up for trying different kinds of beer, this place is for you. Bring money! Unless you wanted to drink nothing but swill. During off-peak times it's almost dead, but still maintains a friendly atmosphere. Each time I go in, the staff is very helpful and friendly. Dan and Brooke both helped a beer newbie like myself finding out what he did and didn't like. When dinnertime rolls around, it get pretty jumpin'. Their food selection is sparse and a tad pricey, but the items are very unique. Give the 'build your own mac and cheese' a try. If feel as though you could eat a horse, try the Kuma's Burger.  If you like heavy metal, hit the place up Tuesday nights and request a song. Maybe they'll finally get some Manowar.",0.9704,0.801,0.166,0.034,0.5873626373626374
2006-09-06,4.0,"I live down the street from Kuma's and it has come to be a local hang out for me and my neighbors.  I am a beer girl, so the selection here is like heaven.  I've tried a good few, but if you aren't sure, the bartenders are always more than happy to help.  The food is also pretty good.  You have to remember, you are still eating at a bar, no matter how well they present the food.  But I would have to say, that they do a good job with their menus, always something to interest any food critic.  Like Kelly U. said, if you don't like the smoke, the back patio is plenty cozy and breezy.",0.9864,0.657,0.288,0.055,0.4876984126984127
2006-08-09,2.0,"So this place is mixed- I want to like it a lot, but can't.  The food's good, but it isn't cheap at all for what you get.  They do go the extra mile to make their food nice- the Kobe sliders come with little pots of ketchup and good mustard, they make yummy homemade potato chips.  My brother's fish tacos smelled though.    They've an exciting beer list that includes unusual selections but be careful!  I ordered a $6 domestic white beer, and it comes in a .25L glass like some high alcohol sipping Belgian or something!  That's a $12 bottle of beer- total scam!  $4 Warsteiner bottles are the best you'll do off the menu if you come here to drink (and they aren't running a special you like).  Other than the little white beer, they do serve each beer in a pretty nice, beer appropriate glass- Pilsner in a Pils glass, etc- so that's cool.  Their patio out back is OK- at least you can sit outside.  But the lighting is really bad, at sundown it'll start to get dark, until they turn on the spotlight mounted up high, then you feel like you've been caught in a prison break!  The sound of the air conditioner whirring away will bring you back to the NW side though.  On the positive side, the last time I went they mixed up our order and no food was prepared for my friend (at a table of 4).  Yeah, that's not cool, but they brought him his food really fast after they told us, and took it off the bill!  I shouldn't be excited about this sort of thing being handled correctly, but I am, and it was.  So the servers get an A+, they've taken service seriously every time I've visited.  I'd like to see this place make enough $ without having to be a rip or drop quality or serve the same beer as everybody else.  But it won't so I predict it changes or is gone within 1-2 years, whether I like or not.",0.9895,0.74,0.176,0.085,0.4865093443142224
