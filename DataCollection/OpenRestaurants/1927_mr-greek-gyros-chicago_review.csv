Unfortunately, that was not their philosophy.  In regards to the food, the gyros was just okay. The pita was good but the meat was lacking seasoning and light on flavor.

I was in Chicago it was late and I wanted some gyros. Literally 20 minutes after I ate this place I threw everything back out. It was just so gross. I know gyros is oily but this was too much and it was very salty. Please don't eat this place. I hate giving bad reviews but wow so sad they couldn't even get their tazatzki sauce right tasted like nothing couldn't even help me eat the gyros.

If you don't like your work, then get out of it. Everything I have eaten here is mediocre at best.  The fries are typical ""back of the freezer"" items, the Italian beefs are not worth ordering, and most of the sides are typical food service frozen items.  Probably could tolerate it in a pinch, but when you throw in the attitude, I say skip this place.

2015-05-30,3.0,"I always pass by Mr. Greek Gyros when I walk to Mariano's but never hungry enough to walk in. I decided to just go for it today and try them out. Walking in, the whole place seemed pretty normal. Tables, chairs, the works. There was quite the selection of food, but I just ordered the #1. The gyro sandwich combo for $8.15. Which is a pretty good deal seeing how just the gyro sandwich was $7.15, which makes the drink and fries only a dollar! The guy at the counter was pretty fun and friendly when I ordered. I've never been a big fan of Greek food, mostly cause I really don't come across it or when I do, I don't eat it, but from what I could tell, it was a lot of meat on a pita, topped with raw onions, tomatoes, and this yogurt tasting white sauce. I believe the meat was made by taking a bunch of ground meat, sticking it on a stick, and roasting it. Then, they cut the outside layers off in thin strips. My food came out pretty fast and wow. It was big. The gyro was incredibly oily and the meat was a bit over salted, but good nonetheless. The yogurt sauce made things milder but I would have preferred a bit more in my gyro. I enjoyed eating the gyro, but it wasn't great. I felt like I was just trying to finish the food in front of me instead of savoring each and every bite. The fries were slightly crispy and fluffy, but they weren't salted. They could've been in the fryer for a while longer or maybe even double fry them. The amount Mr. Greek gave weren't a joke either. I haven't been this full from a $9 meal since I last ate at Chipotle. And let me tell you about their soda fountain. They have Mountain Dew Code Red! I haven't had that in so long! So good... For the taste and quantity given, Mr Greek Gyros is decently good. Plus they're open 24 hours a day and they deliver! Though I'm not too sure how good they'll be once they get cold.

Boy, was I right! I walked in and it's a typical diner-type setting. I ordered the Gyro, Fries and drink for about $6 and was very pleased with what I got. The meat was nice and tender, much better than the Gyro that I get here in Upstate NY. The Tzatziki sauce was (almost) as good as my YiaYia's and the onions and tomatoes were pleasant too. When you order a Gyro at most places, you get kind of a tortilla type wrap filled with a little bit of this and a little bit of that. But, here you get a delicious wrap filled with a massive mound of meat, the excellent Tzatziki and just the right amount of toppings. The fries were good, nothing special - just typical fries.

Now, as I Yelped around the Chi' for a early morning place for a polish and fries, Mr Greek Gyros was my most convenient option. I decided to place a call and verify what their hours of operations were and received the run around for about three minutes. I wish I would have read the review that stated they were open 24 hours, hah.  As my company and I approached Mr Greek's, we discovered our journey for food had led us directly to what seemed to be the hub for all early morning activity in Greek Town. The wait wasn't long to place our order, and our minds were running away with thoughts of sausages and gyros.  The wait for our food was not as short as expected. The self-serve fountain is always a bonus for me, so the SUPER DRINK soon filled my cup. I decided to take the food to go, but there was at least two tables available. Now for what should have been the good part. I arrived home unwrapped my polish and enjoyed the slightly split, crisp, and well dressed early morning sustenance. As for my company's gyro, the meat and dressing was good enough to distract her from the hair that was in the aluminum wrapper. I began to recall how many of the staff at Mr. Greek's didn't have a hat on, but couldn't decisively say I saw any without hats. This discovery is what took away two stars for my rating.

Aside from breakfast, I really enjoy their chicken kabob dinner which is a huge portion served with salad and rice (or whatever side you choose).

2009-11-28,3.0,"On the way home from a day of walking all over Chicago, my roommate and I were in the mood for something cheap, quick, and Greek before we called it a night. Mr. Greek's Gyros, less than a block from our hostel, was quick to provide all three. With extra grease on the side for dipping! First, the good about Mr. Greek: a large menu, and everything is priced to move. I ordered the 'Big Deal', which yielded an enormous gyros, fries, and a drink for five bucks. I'm normally not one to leave a meal unfinished, but even I had to concede to this monster. Barely able to finish my gyros (for size, not taste), I had to pitch a few fries into the wastebasket on our way out. Still, I definitely got my money's worth out of it... The appeal of a 24-hour Greek fast food place is a big one, as other reviewers have mentioned. The place did pretty steady business when we stopped in (6pm on Thanksgiving Eve), but never formed a line. No shady customers, either...mostly families and blue collar dudes on their way home from work. Now for the not-so-good: The restaurant lobby was in clean condition, and I really wish I could've said the same for the restrooms. They were rundown, much more than I was expecting from the dining area. We're talking rundown truck stop bathrooms here, scents and all...not a good intermission for a meal. My gyros tasted fine, but were relatively lackluster: just onions, a little cream, and lots and lots of Italian beef. Fries were crisp but had no flavor (thank Demeter for plenty of salt and mustard). About halfway through my meal, I realized that the $5 meal came with an additional, unseen price: the paper towels I was going to need to soak up the extra oil. I know this comes with the territory, but Mr. Greek could stand to cut back a little. The service here was perfunctory, neither good nor bad. Maybe the guys are a little friendlier outside of the immediate holiday season... If I lived in Chicago, I could definitely see coming back to Mr. Greeks, especially to sop up the liquor on a late night of drinking (is it just me, or were fast food gyros ultimately destined for this purpose?).

However, this place would have gotten one more star if not for the service. Several tickets past my order (my colleague had already received his), I went back up to the counter to check on its progress; I'd hoped the delay was because I'd requested the meat well done--that I could live with. However, after much yelling behind the counter in response to my inquiry, I got the distinct feeling that they'd either forgotten or misplaced my order. When my ticket actually was called a few minutes later, the guy at the counter gave me a look and said, ""Just a few minutes, OK?"" Face turning pink and about to start bellowing about why the hell my ticket was called, I noticed the guy behind him push a tray toward me. And no, my meat was NOT well done. Needless to say, it's no Greektown Gyros, but it does have advantages over both Greektown and Zeus: -a spacious, almost ""airy"" dining room -you don't leave smelling like a french fry for the rest of the day I'd still go to Greektown for a gyros and head to Zeus for a burger.
