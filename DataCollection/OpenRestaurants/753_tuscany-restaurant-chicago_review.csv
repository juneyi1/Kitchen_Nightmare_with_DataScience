2017-08-12,1.0,"The food in this place is great but the manager (Caucasian man in his 50s or 60s) killed my experience. The company or owner of restaurant should probably hire someone who is a bit more welcoming. I walked in last night, apparently my reservation was the last on their list or something, and as I approached the host stand to let the gentleman know about my reservation I could sense he was not in a good mood.  So anyway, I tell him the name my reservation is under and he literally rolled his eyes and said. ""Ugh I know, your table is over there"" pointing at a table near the window. Is that the way you welcome your guests? Wtf dude?  So anyway, I asked my server right away who that man was and he says that the rude man at the door was the manager. Me and my wife told the server we thought he had been rude and the server replied ""yeah he's not very friendly, I'm sorry "".  All I have to say is that there are far too many qualified individuals that could replace him and do a much more acceptable job at greeting people at the door.",-0.93,0.771,0.089,0.14,0.5418701668701668

2017-07-31,4.0,"Tuscany Restaurant is a classy little Italian joint located near University of Illinois at the Chicago campus, also know as the heart of Little Italy. Parking is a bit of a headache, given its location. The interior design of the place isn't overly grandeur, but with evening dining, it is a cozy little romantic place. The restaurant serves up classic cuisine and has something for everyone. If you're a fan of the charcuterie boards, I recommend trying their antipasto for 2 which includes prosciutto, speck(which is a smoked ham), salami,grana (a hard cheese), parmigiano, and olives, served with thinly sliced toasted bread.

Others in the party liked their mushroom risotto with short rib. For vegetarians, the eggplant parmesan dish was only OK. Did not try the chianti but their Pinot Grigio was on the sweet side. The server informed me that all pasta except for the linguine are made in house, which is always a good sign at an Italian restaurant. Overall a good experience with average prices for the area.

First, the bread they brought with the oil/garlic/Parmesan mixture was fantastic. My mouth felt like it was having a party as I was eating that, it is delicious.  However, when it came to the meal, I was expecting homemade pasta from a place like this. I asked the waiter if the pasta is homemade, he said only the ravioli was. This kind of was a curve-ball for me and I wasn't sure what to get now. The waiter mentioned he could have the chef make me some Chicken Parmesan, so I went with that. For not being on the menu it was very good, there were 2 good size pieces of chicken with a side of pasta.  I would definitely come back here next time I am in Chicago.

2017-03-26,3.0,"***Vegetarian review*** I've been struggling with what rating to give this restaurant. I've visited three times so far, which in itself means there's reason enough to return. The fact I've visit twice already and haven't written a review highlights it's not a place I rave about.  I think it's only fair to break out the rating to highlight areas that I very much enjoy as well as the areas that were less than impressive.  ***** 5 stars - for the complimentary roasted head garlic of garlic that is mashed and mixed with olive oil and parmesan cheese to dip complimentary bread in. Pro tip- add a bit of salt to really bring out the flavor. This complimentary dish is reason enough to visit this restaurant. ***** 5 stars - for the pasta quality, which is homemade.  ** 2 stars-  for vegetation friendliness.  There are no designations of which menu options are vegetarian. Why should I have to read an entire menu word for word in order to find the few vegetation options on a menu? In a restaurant that uses traditional Italian names it can be confusing as to which items are in fact veg friendly. This means I have to rely on the waiter to confirm my options. If it's loud, it makes it difficult to accurately communicate with the waiter. If it is busy and the waiter will not be present for a while, I will be then be rushed to simply order whatever the waiter recommends. They went through the trouble of designating gluten free options, why not also add a ""v"" to veggie options??? My first visit's entree was worth a 4 star rating, second visit worth a 5, and last night's visit was worth a 1.  It was a sloppy, oily mess. I couldn't even eat it. This is clearly something the restaurant took no effort in. Luckily there was complimentary bread to fill up on.  ** 2 stars - for wine selection. The options seem to cater to the Apposing ends of the quality spectrum.  They carry extremely low quality as well as a bit pricier options. They really don't offer a mid range option. This is most apparent when attempting to order bottles, especially Champaign. Some of the worst Champaign/Prosecco I've had has been at this restaurant.  We almost didn't visit last night because I wanted wine and remembered their low quality drink options.  *** 3 stars for environment. There's nothing downright terrible about it. It just looks like they gave up trying about 15 years ago. Even the chairs have given up and are wobbly and on the verge of falling apart.  There is an outdoor patio that I feel is a nicer option than dining inside.  ****Service is technically a 3.5. Old school knowledgeable servers but not very friendly. All in all good option if you are close by, but not worth a special trip.",0.9742,0.846,0.108,0.045,0.44252815086148434

And then we ordered two entrees, one with scallops and red sauce, the other a special with spinach noodles and lobster. The scallops/lobster had a gritty texture like they had not been cleaned properly, the red sauce tasted like the same one I buy in a jar from aldi, and the noodles were definitely out of a box. The spinach noodles were a delight, though and definitely homemade. For the price, I'm not sure that we would return",0.9744,0.768,0.185,0.047,0.39742504409171076
2017-03-04,4.0,"I live down the street from Tuscany, and it's a go-to restaurant for date nights with my boyfriend, when we're both too mentally exhausted to come up with any other options. The restaurant always looks full from the outside, but don't let that deter you. We've always walked in without a reservation and been seated in under ten minutes. Now, I know the food is quite pricey compared to the other restaurants in Little Italy, if you're looking at cost per portion, since the dishes are quite small. BUT, here is what we eat so that we come away happy without a hole in our pocket! First up, I haven't tried any drugs, but the complimentary roasted garlic which is smashed and then drowned in olive oil and parmesan is what I imagine snorting coke would feel like. We eat that with ALL of the free bread. No wine, because we're not suckers for average, marked up beverages.  Next, we order a pasta and a pizza, or a pasta and an antipasti. Any pasta with a marinara sauce and seafood (especially shrimp and clams) is a really good bet! The calamari fritti and the margherita pizza are solid choices too.  If we're too loaded up on the bread, we skip the non-pasta dish. But pasta is non-negotiable. We usually get a dessert to share as well, usually the tiramisu. The ambience is cozy, a little too cozy. At peak times, it can be tough to carry out a conversation because the tables are really close together. The lighting is dim and evokes a feeling of calmness. Service is usually on point, but there can be occasional delays with bringing the cheque. The servers are all extremely pally and suggest dishes appropriately.

2016-12-14,5.0,"We happened on this place last year because it was the first restaurant on the corner of Little Italy, and oh my, what a jackpot. I come to Chicago once a year, and I'm going to be eating at Tuscany at least once every trip. We just ate there again tonight and it was one of the best meals I've had all year.  To start, they bring bread and make ""Italian peanut butter"" at your table to go with it: roasted garlic, olive oil, and Parmesan cheese. Seems simple, right? But it's SO delicious. Try not to fill up on it, I dare you.  My boss discovered the veal Parmesan (not on the menu) and will only ever get that because he loved it so much the first time. It's huge - I'm just estimating here but I think it's about a quarter acre of veal, deliciously breaded, quality mozzarella, and a side of pasta with your choice of sauce.  I got ravioli last year, which was good, and tonight I got the flank steak with mashed potatoes. It was absolutely divine. We ate at a $70/plate steakhouse last night and said this steak & potatoes were far superior  - again an estimate but I'd say at least 5km better. The steak was tender and the sauce and flavors were outstanding. The potatoes were creamy but still recognizable as potatoes (you know what I mean?), rich, and moreish. As in, ""I want more"" moreish.  I was eyeing the next table over when they all got a dessert that looked conspicuously delicious, so when our server offered the daily special molten chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream, all 3 of us gleefully succumbed in spite of having just cleaned our plates and filled our stomachs. And it's a good thing we did cause that dessert was divine. The decadent chocolate, the smooth and delightfully flavorful ice cream, and the whipped cream were complimented by a surprise pool of crème anglais that was so good I wanted to order a gallon more with a straw.  I'm sure the wine selection is equally impressive, but our little group sticks to eating our calories and just washed it all down with water tonight, so you're on your own there.  The service is prompt, courteous, helpful, and friendly - the only reason I could see anyone complaining is if they didn't understand the authentically Italian accents of the staff that fill this restaurant. I'd say that's quite a merit badge for Tuscany.  So of course I recommend this place highly - just as long as you save a table for me. I'll be the one licking my plate clean.",0.9988,0.762,0.225,0.013,0.5742246031746032

Since getting to Chicago, I've always wanted to try this spot. Luckily an old friend from high school was in town for a conference so I made arrangements for us to have dinner here before he flew back home. Lucky for us, the food, service, and experience was fantastic. The restaurant feels very upscale and perfect for a date night. It almost felt like we had a private waiter with how attentive and patient he was with us as we were deciding what to order for our meal. Our waiter started off by providing the bread basket and creating a heavenly crushed garlic, olive oil, and parmesan dip. We then ordered a nice red for the evening before going into their Fried Calamari ($14), which are some of the best I've had in the area. The salt and pepper flare thrown into the mix was absolutely delicious. For my main, I ordered their evening special of the Shrimp Ravioli. The dish came out in beautiful colors with tender pieces of shrimp and plenty of pasta to go around. Add a bit of cheese on top and you've got yourself a fine meal. We decided to end our meal on a sugary end with their Chocolate Mouse Cake, a divine way to say goodbye.

Food: -- bruschetta ($6.50): roma tomatoes, basil, evoo, crusty bread.  the ingredients tasted very very fresh! 4/5 -- Raviolini di Pera ($17.50): Roasted pear, parmigiano, toasted nuts, sun-dried tomatoes, mascarpone cream. according to yelp, this is the one of the restaurant's most popular dishes and it comes highly recommended by yelpers so despite how odd a pasta ravioli sounds, I decided to give it a try and didn't regret it! such an interesting flavor combo that works really well together. subtly sweet and savory at the same time. 5/5 -- salmone crocante ($26): crispy skin, braised fennel, gold potato, roasted shallot parsley emulsion. my friend says he orders this dish every time he eats at Tuscany. I tried a bite and will admit that it's good and cooked nicely but the flavor profile doesn't even begin to compare to the complexity of the raviolini di pera! 4/5 Service:  friendly, waters refilled, no complaints Overall:  my friend who's Italian was very defensive when I said it reminded me of a nicer olive garden. he forbid me from mentioning olive garden inside Tuscany lolllll but he's right.

I can't say that I've never received  so quick and on point service than I did today.  They start us off with their garlic, Parmesan cheese and olive oil dip. And we ordered bruschetta to start. It came very fast and then ordered our main entree. I ordered the Pollo Montecarlo and my wife ordered an my wife ordered the fettuccine alla primavera. Her dish was alright, but the Pollo Montecarlo was very tasty. It had a Chardonnay reduction based sauce with the spinach as the base at the bottom. And then the chicken and prosciutto topped with fontinella cheese. All the ingredients complimented each other very well.  One thing that always bothers me is that I never leave enough room for dessert. Perhaps it's the bread in the beginning or chips and salsa at Mexican restaurants but I never seem to be able to taste the desserts.

2016-06-18,1.0,"Let me preface this review by saying that the staff was lovely and this one-star review is by no means their fault. What I do take issue with is the lackadaisical manner in which they update their website. My boyfriend and I were craving Italian food, did our research and Uber'ed down to this restaurant with a plan of eating parpadelle with a wild boar bolognese and gnocchi with sausage ragout.  Welp, as soon as we opened the menu, we honestly thought we were in the wrong restaurant (Seriously, I compared the address and then we contemplated leaving.). When we addressed the issue with the server, he laughed and said, ""Oh yeah, that menu is about a month old. They need to update that."" After checking if we could receive said dishes from the kitchen, he came back and essentially said they could, but would throw some sausage in the sauce, which we all know, throwing greasy sausage in a tomato sauce for five minutes really imparts flavor into it.  We went with two different options instead and they were awful. The veal tortellini had zero sauce in it and was incredibly bland. The same goes with the overdone parpadelle with the flavorless bolognese. Honestly, we've cooked a better Sunday sauce at home and I expected more from Little Italy.  If the restaurant had updated their menu online, we wouldn't have even gone. The pasta combinations were so bizarre that it was clear that they were essentially just throwing ingredients on a plate (Seriously, who serves shrimp scampi with marinara sauce?). Italian food isn't the cheapest of options and I feel sick that I actually spent money here. The whole experience was basically false advertising and I hope the homeless man we gave our doggie bags to enjoyed his meal...because we certainly didn't.",0.8595,0.848,0.091,0.061,0.47945188492063484

The roasted garlic, parmesan, and olive oil for dipping the bread that they gave us was good, but I wish their bread selection was better.  We got the tagliolini alla carbonara and the linguine vongole.  The carbonara was very good, but the first bite was very salty from the pancetta. I could tell the pasta was handmade and fresh, which I loved! My only critique would've been to have less pancetta. I was gulping my water throughout the meal because it was so salty. Even my boyfriend that can eat anything and everything said it was salty for his taste.  The linguine vongole was very good and it came with a generous amount of clams. Very flavorful, but a little salty to my taste as well.  Verdict: I gave it three stars because of the overly salty taste of the pastas and the bread being stale/hard, but I would definitely give this place another try.

2016-02-03,3.0,"What happens when a previously excellent restaurant does something strange twice? Owned by the Phil Stefani Signature Restaurants with three locations, Tuscany has always been a friendly, moderately priced, upscale Italian restaurant that pays particular attention to service and product. They've always been very accommodating. Anyone who bothers to read anything I write knows that I was raised with a grandmother that taught me that garlic is a bulb from the onion family.  She taught me that it should be used sparingly - as in, heat the olive oil in an iron pan and rub the raw garlic across the oil - then toss out the garlic.  She also said that tomato paste was an American invention (Ref: Chef Boyardee) and that if you wanted your sauce thick, you cook it all day. You don't add paste as a thickener. Restaurants that add paste are cheating their customers. You also notice that most of those customers end up eating Zantac and Tums as dessert due to the fact that the sauce was undercooked and has about a thousand times more acid than non-paste sauces that are cooked properly. I note these things as a public service and to their credit, Tuscany understands fresh ingredients.  That said, If you've read other reviews here and the writer raves about the toasted garlic, smashed and served in olive oil, I would suggest that they have (to say the least) an uneducated palate. If you want to eat raw or toasted garlic before your meal, you might as well lick a brine block as you'll actually taste nothing that's served after the fact. Does Tuscany serve garlic as an appetizer? Yes!  If you don't like it then don't eat it... easy.  Do they pay attention to detail and help the customer enjoy the experience? Most of the time - yes. The problem is that on our last two visits we've been served portions that are extraordinarily small. We start with the brick oven pizza. It's always good and there's no need to special order anything about it.  Obviously we need modify the pasta (sans garlic) and do so. The last time we ordered the Penne E Capesante ($22) and this time the Ravioli Della Casa ($18). On both occasions the pasta was cooked perfectly and the flavor was great. The serving size was amazing small. In the case of the ravioli, four squares for $18. Why?  When they place the food in front of you, you stare at it as if it were a joke.  Four pieces of pasta on this big, white plate! Then I realized - it's the menu!  There's been a shift in the way they're doing business. Somehow, someone has decided that Northern Italian cuisine has to be ""small plates"" and multiple courses. This is why you only get a few bites in each course and why, not coincidentally, the overall bill is higher than usual. This is not the way it used to be at Tuscany nor is it the way true Italians serve in Northern Italy.  I know because I have family who own a restaurant in Florence. I've eaten there and you're lucky to walk out with any measure of an ""American"" calorie count.  As the comedian John Pinette said, ""they kept bringing us food to try.  After we'd eaten several dishes they said ""okay - now you order!""  That's an accurate account of the generous nature of food as a presentation of life.  Italian food is not tapas and never has been. For many years we've enjoyed Tuscany. Now it's degraded due to economic revisions. ""Oh, they won't notice!""  Believe me, we noticed.  Now off our list of excellent food at a good value.",0.9941,0.85,0.114,0.036,0.4162778741726109

We sat at the bar and after two glasses of wine and an order of mussels, I must say we had a truly lovely experience. The mussels were excellent. Tuscany really sets themselves apart with their bread situation. I am sure other reviews have mentioned, but getting a plate of roasted garlic and peppers in oil certainly upped the ante for us.  More than anything, we found the staff the perfect compliment to our meal, primarily the woman tending bar. Kimberly (the bartender) was beyond amazing. To be honest, I was initially irritated with her because she declined to pour me the glass of wine I requested. What?!? However, she won me over quickly, letting me try a taste of the wine I ordered and realize for myself that what I requested was not at all what I wanted. She then poured me a glass that was fantastic, so good that I wanted a second. She was extremely attentive but not overbearing.

I went with my fiancée and I got the Paglia Fieno (pasta with prosciutto and mushrooms in a cream sauce) and he got the Chicken Montecarlo (chicken with prosciutto over a bed of spinach). The pasta was cooked well but the prosciutto looked more like deli ham and the mushrooms added decent texture. It was fine, but not worth the $17. His dish was a disappointment. I ate it and couldn't figure out what it tasted like, mostly because it tasted like nothing. I can save you time and money ($20) and just give you air to eat.

I asked for a different entree and exchanged it for pasta primavera. I loved their house noodles, but I hated the sauce and the dish overall.  I expected some variety in vegetables, but the dish only contained zuccini and bell peppers.

2014-09-27,5.0,"In the 80's, I was a working opera singer in Chicago. Two friends of mine from Chicago Lyric Opera were working as singing waiters at the original Stefani's restaurant on Fullerton. I used to show up to sing with them, and I quickly became hooked on the amazing Italian cuisine that this place served up. When they closed several years later, I was heartbroken. I feared I would never taste these dishes again. A couple of years ago, a family member moved to the Taylor Street area, causing me to drop in to Tuscany. O my God, there they were!! The same Stefani family recipes that I had despaired of ever tasting again! When you are first seated, you are presented with a rosted bulb of garlic which the waiter mixes tableside with oil and a bit of salt, to be eaten with a basket of warm breads. For me, that garlic spread and a martini would be enough! One thing you should know is that the menu contains many delightful dishes, but you needn't confine yourself. You will not see many classic Italian staples on the menu. That is because the kitchen will prepare any classic dish if you simply ask. My favorite appetizer is large, tender, alabaster-white grilled calamari, served over arugula salad. It's been off the menu for months now, but I ask and they make it.  Last night, I tried a special appetizer of prosciutto, a white creamy cheese, and fig jam, served with pizzettas (little warm, airy popovers). Amazing! The two entrees I had dreamed abut since Stefani's closed were veal marsala and linguini with white clam sauce. They were both exactly as I remembered them! The veal scaloppini was tender and flavorful, topped in a savory marsala sauce with dozens of little button mushrooms. It comes with a side of rotini in a tasty red sauce. The linguine features tender clams in the shell. I think what I like most about this dish is that is rather dry - not at all oily or saucy. Flavors are robust.  My wife is partial to the veal chop, which is pounded thin to a size that overlaps the plate, and covered with gorgonzola. The restaurant is conveniently located about 3 blocks west of the Taylor Street exit on the Ryan. The valet is only $6, and they park the car in a small lot right beside the restaurant, so you never have to wonder what became of your car.  This is a popular spot for sports fans, so it can be crowded in the early evening before games at the United Center or the UIC. The room is open and attractive, but it can be very noisy when there is a crowd. Bartenders and waitstaff are colorful characters, but very professional and efficient. A tip: Some Costco stores in the Chicago area sell gift cards to all Phil Stefani restaurants. $100 in gift cards for $80. I pick these up when I'm anticipating a trip there. Another tip: Tuscany has another location in Oakbrook. I've been there twice and I don't hate it, but it's not the same. Go to Taylor Street.",0.9933,0.864,0.111,0.025,0.42665694849368313

He tried the pear ravioli with a white cream sauce and it was phenomenal! Our server was quirky but very friendly and informative. I am taking off a star for a few reasons. (3.5 stars is what I would really rate this place) 1. The brown butter sauce was a little different the last time I came. It was more heavy, darker, and seemed to overwhelm the flavor of the dish. My first two times that I came, there was a large abundance of the buttery sauce, but it was lighter in color and flavor.   2. I was pretty disappointed when I ordered the creme brulee that they had as a special, only to find that it was cold. The sugar top was not freshly burnt. After craving it for so long, it was not satisfying to eat when it came straight from the refrigerator.  3. I do not recommend coming here for dates.

I am so glad we did. It was such a nice quiet romantic break from the hustle and bustle that is Chicago. There was no doubt we were in the middle of Little Italy of Chicago either. I am pretty sure the guys sitting a few tables away were Wise Guys. I wasn't about to mess with them. I loved it though. it was lunch the way lunch was meant to be eaten; beautifully plated, waiters in suits, wine by the bottle and the warm smell of garlic in the air. We had two plates of their roasted garlic appetizer. I can't say anything more about it other than you have to get it, ask for the Italian Peanut Butter. You will die happy! Side note, I think there was a private room in the back that would be perfect for a larger group or get together.  We had a great time, left stuffed and happy!",0.9901,0.775,0.185,0.04,0.5378136200716847

My family and I have been coming here for years, as we had family that attended St. Ignatius College Prep in the area. I went to dinner there recently, and was not disappointed. While it will make your breath kick for the rest of the night, the roasted garlic and olive oil they put on the table with bread, versus the typical olive oil and parmesan at Italian restaurants, is delicious. My boyfriend ordered the pork chop special, which was perfectly cooked, and came with delicous caramelized onions and mushrooms, and mashed potatoes. I ordered my favorite pasta dish, the Ravioli a la Pera, which is ravioli stuffed with roasted pear, parmigiano, toasted nuts, sun-dried tomatoes, and in a mascarpone cream sauce. It is one of their most popular dishes at the restaurant, and even my boyfriend who was ""weirded out"" by eating pear ravioli and is the pickiest eater I know, finished my plate off for me and said it was delicious.

When I asked for a pizza without cheese and asked to add mushrooms instead, the bartender taking our order was perplexed at my order. She said that the pizza would be boring and then even proceeded to say that I was complicating things. It's interesting because I've NEVER had this issue at any other location (if this is a surprise to people who do eat cheese). I and other friends have ordered it at other restaurants with ease. So, I was a bit surprised by her reaction. I felt ashamed for ordering a pizza without cheese when I shouldn't have. Terrible customer service if you ask me.

One of the nice things is how they will crush fresh garlic and mix it for you with olive oil for the bread :D .. A nice touch I haven't seen from the other locations on Taylor. Their paglia e fieno is very flavorful.. Reminded me a bit of Campbell's creamy chicken noodle soup, for some reason, which definitely wasn't a bad thing in my eyes :) .. It was flavorful, had good texture, and the prosciutto added a bit of a kick. Another entree I had was a special of the week. Similar to their other food, it definitely reached my expectations of being well prepared and nummy :D Unfortunately, I have not been as impressed with their service. One of the times I came was during Restaurant Week, so understandably, they were busy.. However, I arrived quite early (~40 minutes), and let them know I was here. My party began arriving, but when the reservation time rolled around, they still did not have seating available, and we had to wait an extra 10-20 minutes to finally be seated. Another time I went after, my friends and I found ourselves waiting a loooong time for someone to come over to take our orders, for the food to come out, and for our checks (this happened the other time as well, but we attributed that partially to some of our friends arriving late..). I am wondering if this is due to a cultural difference? The restaurant is very relaxed.. It's a way for people to sit down with close friends and take your time ordering, talking, and eating. However, for people with a limited time frame (or people hoping to avoid a potentially awkward first date? hehe), this lax environment may not be the best place to visit. It also seemed that asking for separate checks was a bit of a hassle for our waiter (adding to the wait)- but we definitely appreciated it. Of note, if you plan to bring in a cake for someone's birthday.. don't. There's a $3 charge, but it's not a $3 charge for the cake.. it's a $3 charge for EACH person. Hefty, and unfortunate misunderstanding. For parking, there is zone 5 nearby, valet, and some meter across the street. Overall, for a relaxed, take-your-time-with-good-friends-not-in-a-rush, and yummy meal, Tuscany is the place to go :) ..

2013-01-15,5.0,"This is the original Tuscany Restaurant and the food is outstanding! When I think of fine Italian dinning in Chicago, this is the only restaurant that comes to mind.  Yes, it's that good! I first came here for a business dinner before we lived in Chicago.  On that evening the wine was flowing for our group of twenty and it was very special.  How many business meals can you say that about?  I was hooked! My recommendations start with the Carpaccio.  Sometimes it's not on the menu, but I still ask.  It has a silky texture with just the right amount of olive oil and shaved Parmesan-Reggiano cheese.  Another great starter is their Bruschetta made from ripe Roma tomatoes, Basil, Olive Oil, on a crusty bread, a steal at $6.00. For dinner we normally order their Pollo Montecarlo.  It's a pan seared chicken breast, with prosciutto, a chardonnay reduction sauce, parmigiano, and spinach for $19.00.   We also love their Gnocchi dish of small potato dumplings, san marzano tomato sauce, bufala mozzarella... for just $15.00.   Another winner is their Penne Seared Scallops, with Garlic, Olive Oil, some red peppers and tomato sauce.  It is a gentle and light dish that is delicious for $19.00.

2012-12-19,5.0,"So after our so-so Italian meal a few weeks back I wasn't too thrilled to be eating Italian food again, but our Groupon was just about to expire and Tuscany blows Mangia Roma (sorry!) out of the water. Tuscany has been around a long time, and it is still the gold standard in Italian cooking. Atmosphere: Don't be intimidated by the formal-feeling dining room. I wouldn't wear a hoodie and jeans here, but you don't need to go all out and wear a suit or fancy dress. Business casual works just fine. Even jeans with a nice shirt or blouse would be okay. Service: Excellent! We were waited on as soon as we were seated and our waiter was accommodating and efficient without being overbearing. We were served bread and water within a few minutes and the water was topped off throughout our entire meal. Price: Prices are pretty standard now across the board for Italian restaurants in Chicago, but whereas the portions at other restaurants can be jokingly small, here they know how to do it right.  FOOD Calamari Fritti: House cocktail sauce, lemon garlic aioli. I've tried fried squid at many an Italian restaurant and Tuscany's was tender and tasty and did not taste like it had been frozen at all. Comes with the two sauces, but it was very good just eaten plain with a little lemon juice drizzled on it. Ravioli Alla Pera: Roasted pear, parmigiano, toasted nuts, sun-dried tomatoes,  mascarpone cream. This was very good and the portion was enormous--a very good deal for the price and enough pasta for two full meals. The pasta was cooked just right and the slightly sweet pear filling paired perfectly with the light cream sauce. Really yummy! Salmon with Eggplant and Crab: This was a special the night we were there and, again, the portion was huge. Two hand-sized salmon fillets, cooked perfectly and topped with a nice portion of crab, rested upon eggplant that tasted like it was slow-cooked for hours. My only complaint here was that it was very oily, so those with fragile constitutions may find it a bit overwhelming, but it was very, very tasty and the portion was enough for two meals. Flatbread Pizza - SPECK: We got this to go because we were both stuffed and we still had some value left on our Groupon. My husband chose the gorgonzola, smoked prosciutto, and mozzarella, which was good, but I just don't like meat on my pizza and they cover the entire thing in very thin slices of prosciutto. Good for those who like prosciutto, though, and the dough was just right. Thin, but not cracker thin, and browned just right. Tuscany has many locations and I've only ever eaten at this Taylor street location, but if you find yourself in the neighborhood and are looking for a traditional Italian meal or want to try something special, you can't go wrong here.

2012-09-30,3.0,"Tuscany is the kind of place you go to when you are in the mood for a hearty, dependable, and authentic Italian meal.  It's not flashy and the entrees are not creative or original.  But what they do, they do very well.   The atmosphere is comfortable and casually elegant.  You will see patrons dressed in cocktail dresses and suits and patrons wearing jeans and a football jersey grabbing a bite after a game.  The waiters are all middle-aged men with Italian accents so thick, we had to search for context clues every time to figure out how to communicate. They start you off with a bulb of freshly roasted garlic delivered to the table and a basket of freshly baked bread varieties.  The waiter then comes buy, expertly mashes the garlic and removes the skin, then adds olive oil and parmesan cheese, creating the most perfect dipping oil for your bread.  Again, it's not original, and many Italian places do this, but that doesn't make it any less delicious. The wine list is not extraordinary but they offer a decent variety that should meet the needs of most customers.  Certainly not the place for a wine expert, but it gets the job done for most normal people. While the standard menu is full of typical Italian specialties - pizza options, pasta options, and standard items like eggplant parmesan - they do have a daily list of specials as well.  I went with one of the specials, the pesce luna, consisting of Hawaiian moonfish over a split pea puree and some sort of pesto.  I'd never had moonfish before, but from what I can tell, the fish was seasoned and prepared very well.  It's a rather dense and dry fish, but the chef made sure the filet was as moist as possible and it went very well with the split pea puree. My boyfriend chose the more classic shrimp linguine.  It was a simple dish, but full of flavor.  The shrimp were gigantic and cooked perfectly.  The sauce was zesty with just enough of a kick from the red pepper and full of garlic.  The linguine was al dente and was the true Italian width that it should be, not the super fat noodles that the Olive Garden type of restaurants pass off as linguine. Overall, the experience was very pleasant and the meal was very delicious.  I wouldn't call Tuscany one of the great Italian restaurants of Chicago, but what they lack in creativity, they make up for in authenticity.  I will probably not return and pay full price, not with all the other amazing Italian restaurants Chicago has to offer in the same price range.  But I would grab a Groupon deal again if one happens to present itself.",0.996,0.831,0.145,0.024,0.48539552432995065

I call the cab we get to the restaurant in 15 minutes, and the waiter or host I assume is asking my cab driver if he could wait he has a table who needs a cab, mind you I'm still in this cab paying. We all get out and that same waiter says ""I'm sorry we are closed."" I said ""Excuse me"" I told him we had just called, and then said why wouldn't you have said that when you seen us in the cab, you watched me pay for the cab and get out, who does that??? Then another gentleman comes over and says well it doesn't matter we are closed, I reminded him of the posted hours and the phone call I made and he didn't seem to care. He was rude and looked at me like I was from Mars.  Funny part is I have been here before and the service was basically the same only I got to order my food that time. I thought maybe the first time was a fluke, maybe a bad night, but after this incident I won't come back here.

We started with house salads which were nothing to write home about.  For dinner I had the Penne which has seared sea scallops, garlic, evoo, herbs, hot pepper, and a light tomato sauce.  I seriously do not know how it gets better than this dish.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and the tomato sauce was full of flavor and spice from the hot peppers.  I loved this and I would definitely order this again and again.   Everyone else at my table had great dishes as well-tilapia, and a couple other pasta dishes-all delicious, but I am still partial to my Penne!  We finished it off with their  tiramisu which I loved as well...I order tiramisu wherever I go and this one ranked up at the top, in my opinion.  Loved Tuscany, only downfall was that it was SUPER loud...not a great place to go if you want to carry on a conversation with anyone at your table...but with the fantastic food you probably won't be doing much talking!",0.9948,0.768,0.22,0.012,0.7149305555555556

So at 6:30 groups of people came in and were seated but we waited our turn.  Finally  we went to the host stand and asked if we were going to be seated soon to which we got ""well we have been waiting for you.""  My boyfriend said we were told to wait in the bar and someone would come get us when our table was ready.  The host responded ""Who said that""  he pointed to the man behind him where we got a blank stare and he was like ""oh yeah, there must have been a miscommunication""  We responded no, you told us to wait in the bar till our table was ready.  He scrambled and seated us with out an apology.

The food is definitely one of the best italian restaurants I have been to but im giving three stars for the service and attitude.  First lets talk about the food... Fried Calamari: Lighly breaded and lightly fried, soft chewy calamari with marina dip and garlic sour cream dip.  Penne: Very strong taste of basil and other herbs mixed into tomato marina sauce....mmmmhhhmmm. delicious BUT with only four pieces of scallops. ($19 for four scallops, really?) Linguini: A little salty but with spicy kick of tomato sauce  was superb. I think there was more than four pieces of shrimp in this one. Breaded Veal (special): the giant piece of meat was o-so-tender but a little too much cheese.  My friend ask for more marinara sauce and they brought a bowl out, charging him an extra $2.  (Really? You can't bring a little bit of marina sauce out for free when he is paying $33 for his veal chop? ) Pear Ravioli: This is by far my favorite at Tuscany's. A test of freshly cooked sweet pear with cinnamon/nutmeg kick is wrapped inside the ravili. A very light dish...no complaints here.  Since we ordered too much food, I asked one of the servers to pack the left over veal and penne together.  When he came back with the wrapped food, my friend asked him to pack the left over pear ravioli (he forgot to ask earlier), the server made a face that said ""why didnt you ask me before when I was packing the other left overs.""  I used to be a waitress so I understand it's annoying, but there was no way he could bring back three dishes all at once (the veal dish was huge like I mentioned earlier) and no need for dirty looks to a customer.  All in all, Tuscany has great flavor but the money-hungry attitude I got by the four pieces of scallops, $2 charge for marinara and $3.50 expresso shots (they recommend this like it's complimentary) left me little desire to go back again.",0.9947,0.784,0.169,0.047,0.4745467032967031

Our entrees were a complete fail, except for the veal chop, which was simple and well done. Everything else was oversauced, yet bland and reminiscent of Olive Garden. The roasted pear ravioli really looked tempting on the menu, but it was kind of like a kids meal--tossed in cheesy white sauce, really tasteless, unidentifiable ravioli filling, and limp shavings of pear mixed in. The veal medallions with gorganzola was overcooked, tough, and the only flavor I got was from the gorganzola. The asparagus was overcooked and brown. Another friend got another veal dish with spinach which was ok, although everyone commented that the spinach tasted like pizza (overseasoned with oregano?).

The restaurant doesn't have a kids menu but the waiter was quite helpful and suggested we could get a pizza or half order of pasta; great suggestions and my kids loved the pizza.  My three star rating is due to the barely edible dish that I ordered. The linguine with shrimp scampi, evoo and crushed red peppers. It was SO spicy that I barely ate it and for $22 I felt jipped.

(insignificant really ;p) now my first OMG moment was when they brought out the bread, parmesan, and olive oil (just like any other Italian restaurant), but they added another ingredient to it. The server held out an entire roasted garlic and squeezed the inside of the garlic on a plate. NOW i LOVE garlic, but I never knew garlic can become so mushy just by roasting it.  Then our server took the parmesan sprinkled it all over the garlic, added the olive oil and mixed the entire thing up and created this lovely paste for us to enjoy with our bread. For garlic lovers, YUM absolutely heaven. My friend and I finished the entire basket of bread and the garlic parmesan olive oil ;p  Now to the main dish ;) I ordered the Penne pasta, and my friend ordered the Lobster filled Ravioli ;) BOTH were Delish ;)  The Penne was in a slightly spicy light tomato sauce (almost like a arabiatta according to my friend) with basil and four huge scallops ;) I'm not a fan of thick tomato sauce so this dish met my needs and didn't overpower my palette ;) The lobster filled ravioli was in white alfredo? sauce, and just oo so yummy. Now this dish has a very solid taste, so I probably wouldn't have been able to finish half the dish before becoming overwhelmed by it. But thats just me ;)  Overall, the dishes were good and the wine was a nice subtle addition, but I have to say the waiters there aren't very hmm excited/happy/friendly??  I don't know maybe I caught them on a bad day.

We ordered the Caprese, which was very bland.  The Affumicata pizza ( roasted chicken, bacon, smoked mozzarella, and romano) was decent. The bacon was soft and the pizza mostly tasted like bacon and cheese so yea it was decent.  The Pollo Montecarlo and the Pollo Vesuvio were both bland as well. The montecarlo seemed poached because the chicken was very pale, it had no sear. The sauce had a very very strange flavor almost reminiscent of cream of chicken mixed with cheese. It was as if the dish was made by someone with no taste buds. The vesuvio was a bit better. Overall nothing was tasty. Notice I didn't mention my dining experience beginning with the server crushing roasted garlic, olive oil & parmesan cheese table side for our bread. Yea that didn't happen. He gave us a menu then left. Then I flagged him down when we were ready to order.

Management should have apologized to all the people waiting by giving us a discount or something, but we did not even get an apology! We were very hungry, so we expected the food to taste especially good...but it was disappointing. The best part of the meal was the roasted garlic spread that came with the bread. We had: Calamari Fritti: basically fried calamari, nothing special. The lemon garlic sauce that came with it was delicious though. Penne with scallops: 4 pieces of very tiny scallops with penne in tomato sauce for $19, not worth it. Could have made this dish at home. Hubby was disappointed. Pollo Arrosto: basically a fried whole chicken with roasted veggies. I thought the chicken was way too salty, although the veggies were perfectly cooked. It was a huge plate so I brought it home since I thought it might taste good with some rice to help with the saltiness (what can I say, I'm Asian and I love rice). Overall, a very unsatisfying experience. The service was not great and we could not enjoy our dinner since we were seated so late and had to rush through our meal.  We live in the neighborhood and will NOT be coming back.

That really made me like the place much more and give it a much more authentic feel. The restaurant's decor isn't anything spectacular but it is classy and Italian-esque. The menu options were all entirely in Italian besides the small descriptions underneath which still contained many ingredients which I have never heard of. I felt almost like I was taking a RISK being there, the food was so different from everything I've been used to so far. I ordered Tortellini, which was yummy. The creamy sauce was good and the mushroom filling was good as well. My friend seemed to enjoy it as well. He ordered chicken parmigiana which was super cheesy but sooo so good! I preferred his option to mine actually as I realized mine got dull after 2 to 3 bites, while his had more flavor. The side of pasta his chicken came with tasted bland though and we reffered to it as ""Chef Boyardee"" jokingly. No harm. The desserts were really yummy. We got the oreo cheesecake with fresh strawberries and Baileys sauce. It was simply orgasmic. The chocolate moussee cake that my friend got was too flavorful for my taste - i couldnt tell if it was too sweet or too bitter but either way it was just a little too intense for my taste.

Your dining experience begins with the server crushing roasted garlic, olive oil & parmesan cheese table side for your bread. Very, very good. Appetizers were another highlight. We had the Bruschetta and an order of pancetta wrapped scallops. Both were delicious and prepared perfectly. For my entrée I had: Vitella Gorgonzola- strauss ""group-raised"" veal medallions, asparagus, pinot grigio, gorgonzola, crispy polenta.  It was okay. In all honesty I probably should have just ordered a pasta entrée. But none of the options piqued my interest enough. My dining companions both went with one of the specials. A pork medallion entrée. Here's where the service gets a bit sketchy, my dining companion wanted veggies instead of potatoes and asked the server if that was an option. It was, but the server couldn't confirm what type of veggies. Took him quite a while to return from the kitchen with any type of answer.  Okay Italian fare in a great neighborhood.

The veal stuffed ravioli came in a white cream cheese sauce.  You can really taste the parm cheese but the raviolis themselves were kinda small so you could not taste much of the meat.  The sauce kinda overpowered, but it was good.  And the portions was plenty.   I had the Margharita Pizza.  Was cooked in a wood burning oven, but not quite as authentic as i had hoped.  But was very good.  Good quality cheese and FRESH BASIL really made it good.

I ordered the Della Casa salad which the menu said was frisee and mixed greens with a sherry vinagrette.  Ok, it was a public school salad of 99% iceberg and there were only 2 tiny sprigs of frisee in it.  And I asked for no tomatoes and it had tomatoes on it.  Iceberg, 2 sprigs of frisee and cucumber with the tomatoes I said I did not want.  The dressing was good though. My chicken piccata was horrible.  No flavor, no seasonings and it was decorated with a rosemary tree sticking up into the air.  Just looked stupid.  I had to salt the entire dish and I NEVER ever use salt. It says a lot when I have to use salt. Laslty, the dessert was supposed to be a lava cake.  Ok, this was a dried out store bought mini bundt cake that they poured bottled chocolate syrup into the middle of and called lava cake.  Dry as a bone too.

The wait staff is nice, if only a tad bit hard to understand at times (depending on who you get of course.), but it lends a little legitimacy to the whole theme. I got the Salisccia (sp?). It was good. The peppers were rich, savory, and the sauce was very near perfect. The sausage was a little over cooked but remained flavorful.

It ended up being okay because we have a most wonderful meal outside of the restaurant week special.  The meal started with the server bringing roasted garlic, crushing it at the table and pouring olive oil over it. More bread was requested and provided. With this wonderful dish, we decided to forego the appetizer. I asked the server for a recommendation: the stuffed double cut pork chop, garlic mashed potatoes, agrodolce or the Tuscan sausage & peppers. I expected him to push the pork chops because they were $5 more expensive but he suggested the sausage and it was unbelievable. I don't think I have ever tasted more flavorful pieces of meat. My girlfriend is a vegetarian and asked the server if the cook could make a veggie primavera which he did. I had some and it was really tasty. The service was wonderful. Many choices for dessert but we split coconut sorbet which was served in a frozen ""half coconut"". The sorbet was one of the best I tasted and left me feeling refreshed not full as the tiramisu would have.

2010-01-28,2.0,"I have always known that Tuscany is an expensive place to eat, so we tried it for lunch in hopes that we can get a great meal for a little less money. Well the bill for two entrees and a glass of wine was $28, but it definitely was not worth it. Since we were not feeling a heavy Italian dish for lunch she got the Martguerita pizza and i got the turkey meatball panini. So the pizza looked and tasted like it just came out of the new Dominoes commercial. There was nothing special about it and it even looked like a regular, $5 anytime pizza. My ""panini"" was nothing more than a meatball sandwich. When I think of panini, I think of a flattened, grilled sandwich. This was on a kaiser roll with mozzarella drenched on top of 8 small meatballs and marinara. the fries that came with the dish were similar to Steak and Shake, so if you like that type of thing... The waiter took about 25 minutes to come ask what we want (I remind you again, this was lunch on a Thursday). Plus, $6 to park if you wanted a valet guy to drive your car 4 spots.

2010-01-14,5.0,"My wife and I have been here twice now and we've quite enjoyed both visits. The food is good, the service excellent and the atmosphere just right, perfectly Italian (in a restaurant sort of sense anyway). I guess we've been kind of boring on the food side as we both got the same thing on both visits. For her it's the Ravioli Pera, which is undeniably delicious. I was quite tempted to get it myself on the second visit, but I think it's just a hint too sweet for a full meal for my palate. It is very sweet, but with a wonderful buttery texture. The idea of grinding up pine nuts to throw in there too is wonderful. They really help create that texture. Although it's all just a mash inside the raviolis, I felt like I could make out a few distinct flavors, pine nuts being one of them. The sauce they all swim in is really where that sweetness comes from, but it has a great warm and creamy texture to it too. Lots of flavors meld together in this dish and, as strange as this may sound, it tastes like fall to me. There is no pumpkin or butternut squash in it as far as I could tell, but that's sort of the flavor and texture it reminds me of.  I would definitely recommend it.  On both visits I ordered the Linguine with the scampi. First, the shrimp are huge. You get probably four or five of them and they are very large and perfectly cooked. Not burnt or crusted at all. The pasta is fine with a good bite and texture to it. My favorite part, however, is the sauce. It's a spicy cream sauce that just coats everything and makes you want to lick the plate when you're done. The spice is just right, hot enough without being too hot. The creamy nature of it balances it out nicely.  Another element of the food that I forgot to mention above is the roasted garlic that your server mashes up for you at the table. They take a big head of roasted garlic and squeeze it out on a plate, mix it with oil and cheese and you've got a very tasty fresh dip for the bread. It's an interesting experience the first time they do it, especially if you've never worked with a head of garlic before, but the results are very tasty.  As I mentioned, the service is excellent at Tuscany. Very attentive without being bothersome. You generally seem to have two waiters, one primary and one secondary who mostly just fills drinks. It's a good system they've got. It works. All of the waiters seem to be older and experienced men (many of whom seem to speak Italian to each other). It strikes me as odd that they're all men, but they get the job done right so I can't really complain. The atmosphere is good too. I don't remember if there was music or not, so at least I know it wasn't distracting. The lighting is brighter than you might expect, not truly romantic, but it works for this place. It doesn't feel like an IHOP inside anyway. The tables have nice linens and the napkins are cloth.  I do think, however, that Tuscany might be just a little overpriced. It feels almost like they're trying to drive clientèle by price and not necessarily price by service, if that makes any sense. It's okay though, not unreasonable. I hesitate to give this place the full 5 stars, I'm not sure it's quite that good and I am sure there are better and more authentic Italian restaurants in the city, but we've enjoyed both of our trips and wouldn't hesitate to go back.",0.9989,0.756,0.203,0.041,0.5615203050917338

Which goes without saying that they are experienced and to the point. However, I have to share my experience on Saturday because it was extremely disappointing.  My brother graduated from Columbia and my mom had called a few days before to try and get a reservation. They normally open at 5, but when she mentioned the graduation, they said we could come at 4. We showed up about five minutes early and as they were about to seat us, some miscommunication between the person seating us and someone from the kitchen kept us waiting. And waiting. And waiting. The host told us it would be a ""few minutes"" and said appetizers were on him, which I thought was really nice. We weren't in a huge rush, though all of us were pretty hungry. Well a few minutes turned into half an hour without any acknowledgement from the staff. I called Rosebud, found out they were open and convinced my family to ditch Tuscany. Here are two points I'd like to make: 1) Be honest. If you can't seat us before 5, just say so. It's not our fault for coming when you said we could. 2) There are way too many restaurants on Taylor Street for you to assume we're going to stand around as if we're without options.

I went to Tuscany this past weekend to celebrate my bf's birthday with some friends. Not being a big 'sports' person, I somehow managed to make reservations during the Bulls vs. Celtics game and my friends were asking about possibly changing reservations or going somewhere else.  Luckily, I vaguely remembered that they had a tv there.  I gave the restaurant a call and arranged to have us seated near a tv - they were extremely helpful on the phone. When we arrived, I was shocked that they'd placed us directly in front of a tv.  They were extremely accommodating and the host even joked with us a bit about our seating arrangements.  So friendly!!  The waiter was so pleasant and patient with us, especially since a member of our party was running late so we had to wait prior to placing our orders. I can't speak for the rest of my party but my meal was delicious.  I started with the Caesar salad which was unlike any other I've had - really fresh!  I'm pretty sure it was the way they made their dressing.  I could've used a little less dressing though but nonetheless, it was still good.  For my main course, I had the Halibut special over yukon mashed potatoes in a lobster sauce.  Just thinking about it is making my mouth water, the texture of the halibut was so buttery and the sauce - I wish they'd given me more! I think my only disappointment for the night was the dessert.  We ordered the chocolate lava cake even though the waiter kept mentioning cheesecake.  The cake was dry and there was barely any chocolate lava.  The cake seriously tasted like it'd been baked hours ahead of time and then reheated - a Hostess cupcake would've been more moist than this.

2009-02-22,4.0,"Went here for the first time last night and had a great time! If I were to strictly rate just the food then I would give it 5 stars. I thought the quality and flavor of everything we had that night was great. We started off with the fried calamari (I know...pretty much every restaurant has one) but I was impressed by the freshness of the squid and the flavor of the sauce. The calamari practically melts in your mouth when you bite into it, a definite sign that it is fresh and not overcooked. The breading was light and the cocktail sauce had a nice smokey flavor to it. My friends and I were also given the standard side of bread as a starter, which is not in itself anything to rave about, but what made it special was the roasted garlic that the waiter brought to the table and mixed with Parmesan cheese and olive oil. Yum! To me that signifies a little extra attention to detail.  For my main course I ordered one of the daily specials, a fettuccine dish with roasted lamb. I forgot the exact name because I couldn't even pronounce it but my dish was delicious. The noodles tasted like they were freshly made and cooked al dente. The sauce was a mixture of chopped up roasted lamb, carrots, tomatoes, and mushrooms. It was extremely flavorful and the lamb did not taste gamey at all. It was chunky and there was plenty of meat in the dish but it didn't drown the noodles.  One of my friends had the tortellini dish with chicken in vodka sauce (also a ""special"" of the day) and I had a little bite. The tortellini tasted great but the sauce was even more amazing. It had great flavor without being too heavy or too creamy. I wish I could've dunked some bread in it but it wasn't my plate. We passed on dessert because we were too full from dinner. They give you good-sized portions of food. I wouldn't say the food is cheap but you certainly get a lot.  I had to minus a star though because parking on a busy Saturday night is almost impossible so you pretty much have to use their valet service, which was $6 that night. Also, the restaurant is small and the tables are set close together so when it's busy like it was last night then you're probably gonna bump into at least one person's elbows at some point. The bar area was super crowded with people waiting but luckily we made reservations ahead of time. We still had to wait another 15 minutes to be seated even though we had reservations but we were so hungry that that didn't really bother us a whole lot. The staff were all very professional and friendly though. I would not recommend this place for a first date when it's busy because it was so loud and crowded while we were there that we pretty much had to yell at each other the whole time even though we were sitting at a tiny 4-person table.

While I completely understand the draw of the place- once again, pretty decent food (albeit a little heavy and one-dimensional for my tastes), a very well-trained and hard working wait staff- I think one could possibly do better, even for the decent prices, elsewhere.

As an English girl whose country is known for and is used to bland food, his food seeking abilities makes him a definite keeper. On to the food itself: his pear ravioli (pear and parmigiano stuffed ravioli with a puree of pine nuts, walnuts, cashews, sun-dried tomatoes, fresh pears and mascarpone cheese) was a little on the sweet side. I think I enjoyed it more than him, but was a delight to my taste-buds. I, predictably, ordered the 'Spaghettini al Capriccio di Mare' which is made with garlic, olive oil, calamari, octopus, mussels, clams, shrimp, marinara sauce and herbs. The seafood was very well prepared, especially the octopus. I also sampled his carpaccio and we split a tiramisu... I wish I had that tiramisu recipe-it was perfect.

I tried the chocolate cannoli for dessert and I didn't care for it.  I expected the filling to be flavored with cocoa, but instead the shell was dipped in chocolate and it had the standard ricotta filling.  The chocolate was tasty, but a bit too rich and impossible to eat without getting chocolate all over myself.  Next time I'll skip the dessert or stick with a simple scoop of gelato.

Tuscany on Taylor has a charm about it.  Nestled in the heart of Little Italy, everyone who works there is so welcoming!  As most of the waiters are off the boat from Italy, Tuscany is like Little Italy's answer to Greek Islands! If you're going to eat here, you have to look at the specials...they always have amazing fish specials and random other entrees that the staff takes tremendous pride in.   I would recommend starting with the Pasta Fagiole...trust me on a cold day...heck, even on a hot day, this soup will blow your mind!  I like to add a couple spoons of Parmesan cheese to keep it healthy!!!  Seriously...skip the salad, and order the soup! For my meals if I don't bite on one of the fish specials, I have two staples at Tuscany, one is on the menu...one is not.  They hook it up for the regulars with a special order and are always happy to do so! First, for the pasta/carb lover...or for the little fat-ass that lives inside all of us, I order the Raviolini ai Quattro Formagi, but with a little twist.  This dish is Veal and Parmesan stuffed ravioli in a four cheese sauce, guaranteed to induce food coma and restrict feeling in your lower extremities.  The trick, is to order off the menu and have them use the Bolognese sauce in place of the Four Cheese.  You just might need a cigarette after, it's that good! Second, I recommend the Regina Pizza.  This is Chicago's answer to thin crust pizza...and more or less the only one in the city that I will order.  It comes topped with Sausage, Green Peppers, Mushroom and  their excellent cheese and marinara sauce... If you are going on a date, or with two people, I would even recommend ordering both of these dishes and they will serve them to you split them, and the waiters will distribute the wholesome goodness via French service.  French Service, it's not just for the French!. So the entrees are through, if you have finished it all, you too, have a little lard ass inside of you!  However you're not done yet!  The Canolis here are pretty flippin' awesome!  So split one or fulfill your lard ass prophecy and you each order your own.

2006-02-18,5.0,"I love this place.  Back when I lived in Lincoln Park, we'd go to Stefani's often.  Then they closed up and tore it down.  We were bummed.  Then we moved to University Village and started going to Tuscany-it's excellent and Mario is a killer waiter.  I gotta disagree about the place being pricey.  If anything I think it's a bargain.",0.4215,0.747,0.148,0.105,0.3977777777777778
