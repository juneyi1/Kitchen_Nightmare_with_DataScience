2017-07-18,4.0,"I used to live a block from El Paisano and and it was my I-feel-super-lazy dinner spot. It's a solid Taqueria, and the service is very good. It meets one of my favorite criteria, namely having the obscure menu items that aren't even labeled. Don't know what a Huarache is? Order it and find out! Not that they wouldn't tell you of course, the staff are notably friendly and helpful. The Huarache is in fact my favorite thing to get here (it's basically a flat Gordita). There are a few things that aren't great; the Al Pastor is the wet non-skewer kind and the tamales are the nasty dry kind. The place also smells a little weird in a cleaner-y way. I see another reviewer saying it's a common Mexican floor-cleaning product, so good to know it is, in fact, just cleaner.  It's a mild enough smell that you stop noticing a couple minutes after walking in.",0.9369,0.755,0.167,0.078,0.5835714285714285

Come back tomorrow, it'll be different!""   I know, nobody should expect McDonalds-type consistency at a neighborhood taco joint, but having tried their food on multiple occasions, it really seems like the quality depends on whoever's working that day.   A taco will have the same ingredients from day to day, but not in the same proportions.  There don't seem to be any ""house rules"" or even a general style of presentation.  Like, people apply for a job and the boss just asks them:  ""You know how to make a burrito, right?  Great, you're hired!"" A couple times it's been outstanding, especially for the price.  Other times, it's been head-scratchingly weird/bad. Maybe the most accurate thing to say is They Definitely Have Food That You Can Eat If You Are Hungry.   Other notes:  It smells bad in here.  Kind of sewage problem-y, so probably beyond their control, but still.... Also:  ""Al pastor"" is all over the place!  Four different visits, four different ""recipes.""  This last time is what inspired me to write this review - it tasted more like what they call down south ""salt pork.""  The stuff that you find little bits of in your scrapple or whatever.  No pineapple taste - it wasn't even reddish.  Should've listened to my granddad who used to say ""If you don't see the cone, leave the pastor alone."" But as I said before, there is definitely food here, and if you need to eat something, this place has some things you can eat.  I would say something about the salsas, but they are different every time also.  There is always one red and one green, but they sure don't taste the same!  Actually, maybe this is kind of cool.  Maybe I'm the one that's being stupid.  Who knows.

Baffled, obviously because we had just begun our new ""taco-eating"" relationship.

So in my mind, not only would I not be able to eat my order, but I'd also have to exchange it....that didn't fly. After some pouting, the owner reluctantly agreed to have someone deliver my new order, but under one condition RETURN THE WRONG ORDER. How rude! Were they going to serve it to someone else?

She also showed me her rice and said ""is that normal""?  Yes, the arroz had a tiny sprinkling of green peas, little carrots, and little potatoes in it. The ground beef in the flautas had some potatoes mixed in. This is is a common way to make rice or ground beef, but I have only been to 2-3 taquerias where they do this. Every region in Mexico and the Southwestern USA has its own style and some of the cooks around here must be from a place where tossing those things in is considered cool. Hybridity is the name of the game in the Mexican kitchen and I thought the little peas tasted great!  Big plus around here: Open at 9 am!  If you are not familiar with Mexican food - try breakfast wherever you can. I am happy to see a taqueria open for breakfast. The breakfasts are $4.99 and the Chilaquiles Juevos and steak plate is only $6.99.

I know enough about great Mexican food to hold a weighted opinion. This place, overall, is not very good. The burritos are pretty weak and they cut them in half. Why the midwest cuts their burritos in half, I'll never understand. It should be packed and wrapped as tightly as possible, like a newspaper, but instead they cut it in half, thus compromising the structure. If you can't get the wrap right, the burrito is flawed from the start, no matter what you stuff in it. Hamburgers and hot dogs? Come on, guys. The Bistec Mexicana? Okay, at best. Really great flavor, but the steaks themselves are butchered too small. The breakfasts? The chorizo is a good effort, what with being made in house and spiced just right, but they continually burn the eggs. Bad news. So what makes this place four stars? The tacos.  They have these down to a science, except for the chicken tacos. For some reason, they cast these aside, but the others pull up the weight. I do believe it's because there isn't much flavor in chicken to start with, whereas the rest of the tacos derive the majority of their flavor from their own rendered fat. Flavor in, flavor out. The carne asada is amazing. Diced and sauteed pieces of ribeye that didn't make the cut for the Bistec. They have an awesome adobo spice they use on these, then topped with lettuce and tomato--and I do avocado--all while sprinkling the crown jewel: soft Queso Blanco over the meat. The flavor of the Mexican cheese with the adobo spices and the meat, absolutely rock and roll.  The lengua (beef tongue) tacos, pastor, and carnitas are amazing as well. The same adobo spice, topped with cilantro and onion. Squeeze a little lime on these bad boys, and the rendered pork with the carnitas and pastor really come through and leaves the meat extremely juicy. The pastor has a little more kick to it, but man alive is it good.  The chile relleno taco is great due to perfectly roasting the peppers, leaving a sweet hint to the heat. Stuffed with cheese? Can't go wrong. The one thing that throws people about this place is the salsa. It's not straight up, traditional pico that most people are used to. This isn't Chi-Chi's or Uncle Julio's Hacienda, it's salsa roja. The roja is roasted red chile peppers with a few slivers of habanero thrown in, then blended into a puree, made every day from scratch. How do I know? I asked and watched one Saturday morning while nursing a hangover. The little black bits? Charred skin left from the peeling process. While not a great dipping vehicle for the chips, the roja is amazing drizzled on the tacos.  Beans are refried with lard, old school style. Doesn't come out seeming like a canned ordeal. I dig the rice, but then again, I have nothing against papas in my rice. Pretty middle of the road.  Three carne asada, pastor, lengua, or carnitas tacos, with rice and beans, and a horchata? All for $5? Beautiful.",0.9971,0.783,0.155,0.062,0.5375162315638505

2007-12-27,1.0,"There is no such thing as good Mexican food in Chicago. The. End. Okay, but it would be enough for me to say that, right? No, I must explain. And I will start with El Paisano's. Now, my ex loves this place up and down. He'd eat here every night if he could. He fell in love with the carne tacos when he first moved to Chicago and his love has yet to wane. The several times I went there, though, I just couldn't hop on the bandwagon. The chicken tacos were disgusting and the carne talks were equally gross. The only taco I did half-enjoy was the pepper version, which was a stuffed pepper of sorts in the taco. But it's the kind of thing where you can only eat one.  The first few times I went, their chips and salsa did impress me. But after a while I realized that the salsa was watery and almost tasteless, like they were diluting it the way my mom used to do when we were almost out of ranch dressing. The chips were hit or miss, too. And the enchiladas? They weren't *that* bad, but they're the kind of thing you could get from any Banquet dinner from the grocery store, and I'll admit I have a soft spot for Banquet dinners that have the cheese enchiladas (it's a holdover from when I was little and that's what mom heated up and called ""dinner"").  But overall, despite being incredibly inexpensive, this place is worth passing. You can get the same stuff at any Taqueria in Chicago, no lie. So hit up the Taco Bell or go to Chili's or something. This place isn't worth the disappointment you can get elsewhere.",0.9778,0.815,0.131,0.054,0.48943121693121694

The usual fare is top-notch (tacos, burritos) and honestly, I haven't yet tried anything else. I usually pig out on the chips and all I have room for is a steak, tongue, or beef taco.  **For table service, if you just sit down, they will bring you complimentary chips and salsa (red and green) and water.",0.9403,0.829,0.171,0.0,0.4264957264957265
