2017-08-24,1.0,"This restaurant is NO LONGER David Burke's Primehouse.  David Burke is no longer associated and you can tell by the drastic changes to the menu and quality.  Loved the popovers?  Gone.  Loved the red velvet cake?  Gone.  No aspect of our dinner was excellent.  Restaurant was dead empty on a Wednesday night.  Rather than popovers, we were served rock hard possibly sourdough rolls (hard to tell when you are breaking your teeth).  Corn soup was sickly sweet and had some oddly uncooked vegetables in it.  Steak was not cooked to specifications.  Medium steak was bloody raw.  Medium rare steak (a 40-day ribeye) was brown all the way through, dry and chewy.  Mashed potatoes were fine, but the steamed vegetables were simply warm crudités--raw and crunchy.  If you loved David Burke's, you will be not just disappointed, but angry.",0.8033,0.757,0.138,0.105,0.6422435897435899

I understand paying $15 for a drink if it's cool to be there and the cocktail is amazing. However, paying $12 for a draft beer at an average hotel bar is ludicrous. Too many other places in the area that have great drinks and great service to line the pockets of this lackluster hotel bar.",0.9153,0.795,0.175,0.031,0.6178571428571429
2017-08-08,5.0,"Amazing dinner. We spent about $300 for the two of us. The service is superior. Our server, Kevin, was great at explaining the different foods. We started with half a dozen oysters and received a set of oysters from 3 different regions. The bread and butter provided was delicious. Coffee was strong and plentiful. We decided to do a 55 day dry aged steak each and it was DELICIOUS!  Learning about the dry age process made us have to try. We added the Mac and cheese as well as mashed potatoes. The flavor was phenomenal. We were STUFFED but had to try dessert.  We ordered the creme brûlée and million dollar cake. The pastry chef even added a ""happy anniversary"" message to our plate to personalize it. We definitely over ate but we're able to walk it off!  This place is a must try but be prepared to spend a small fortune!",0.9771,0.829,0.171,0.0,0.6319444444444444
2017-08-07,3.0,"A few friends from out of town heard Chicago was great for steak and found Primehouse on some list of top places to get steak. My very first impression of the menu was that they really highlight their dry-aged steaks... and charge a pretty penny for them! I personally am not really a steak person but I tagged along anyways.  The ambiance of the restaurant is very classy and while you don't NEED to be dressed up, you may feel a bit underdressed if you don't. The rest of the customers were in business attire while we strolled in Nikes in jeans/shorts. For a Friday night we easily scored a 7pm reservation for a party of 6 - makes you think a little huh?  I got the beef Carpaccio and black pepper fries as my main along with a draft beer and was fully satisfied. The Carpaccio was what you'd expect thought the sliced veggies on top tasted fresh and were refreshingly light. I highly recommend the black pepper fries with the aioli as they are crisp and flavorful. The pepper could be distributed more evenly but I was glad that it was additionally topped with some other seasoning and cheese (same stuff as on top of the creamed spinach). I actually would have been perfectly happy with those fries... Now to the steaks. The guys in the group got either the 40 day or the 55 day dry-aged rib-eye. They also serve non dry-aged steaks but it seems may be less popular. The rib-eyes are served bone in at around 20 oz with roughly 12-14 oz of protein. The cuts had a good layer of fat to add to the juiciness/flavor of the beef. When ordered medium rare, the meat along the bone ended up being much closer to rare and many of the guys chose to forego that section. If you like your steak more natural ""beef"" flavored, stick with the 40 day because as they are aged longer, they gain a game-iness to them. I only had a small piece of the 55 day but it I thought the steak was very tender and exploding of complex flavors. Apparently, the more rare pieces tasted gamey-ier and at $70 a pop, I'm not sure it's entirely worth the while.",0.9968,0.807,0.18,0.013,0.5343236714975843

2017-07-20,1.0,"My mom was in town visiting and insisted that we have dinner at her favorite restaurant, David Burke's Prime. Unbeknownst to us, this property is no longer affiliated with David Burke. The physical space is the same (pretty drab), the prices are the same (very expensive), but the food and the service have taken a nose dive! At first it was very unclear who our server was. Two people that looked like waiters approached the table and asked if we had been helped yet. When we told them ""no"" they retreated to get a server. Ok... when we finally did get our server I asked if the place was still affiliated with David Burke and just got an awkward, flat ""No"" response. Whatever. I guess it would have been cool to get some reassurance? For apps we got the carpaccio and a crab cake. The texture of the crab cake was clumpy and plain and simple it did not taste fresh. The carpaccio was ok.  For entrees, I ordered the KC bone-in, medium rare. When our dishes arrive, mine was a raw PURPLE all the way through! I sent it back and by the time it came back to the table (still a far cry from medium rare pink) the rest of my party had already finished their entrees. This is an extraordinary failure when you are paying $70 for a steak.  Lastly, the server not only carelessly presented us with the wrong bill, but inside the folio was the credit card belonging to another guest! We could have just signed that and been on our way with this guests credit card.  If this experience is any indication, this place won't be here for too much longer. There are far too many great steak houses in Chicago to over pay for poor ambiance, over-priced, under-cooked food and haphazard service at this place.",0.8153,0.825,0.097,0.078,0.5695467032967033

2017-06-16,1.0,"It was my first time at this steakhouse and it will be my last visit.  I made reservations for an 11 person group and was disappointed with the food and the service. I was excited to dine at this reputable steakhouse, unfortunately it did not meet my expectations; I fail to see its prestige.  THE SERVICE- Poor customer Care The waiter spilled a full beer on one of the guest's sport jacket. While the server apologized at that immediate moment, I don't believe it was appropriately addressed. I didn't expect a discount on the tab, but I did expect some offering of having the jacket dry cleaned. As this is a nicer dining facility, I had higher expectations in regards to reasonable customer care.The waiter did toss an ice cream/sorbet dessert in, free of charge, but again I don't think that was reasonable, commensurate substitute for a dry cleaning bill.  THE STEAK--overcooked, then under-cooked In addition to the poor service, I want to address the underwhelming quality of the food. I wish I could speak to the quality of the steak itself, but the cook seemed to misunderstand what medium rare means. I ordered the 55-day dry aged rib-eye steak cooked medium rare, more on the rare end; it came out overcooked, just under well-done. I hesitated to send the steak back, but was urged by friends. The second service came out under-cooked--the fat on the meat wasn't just cold, but it was still solid as if the steak was tossed in the pan, frozen.   THE SIDES:  Basil Mashed potatoes- not bad; Mushrooms-the tastiest thing we had in my opinion, but slightly over salted; Mac N'Cheese-Nothing outstanding; Creamy Greens--Nothing outstanding DESSERTS:  The sorbets and ice cream-flavorful DRINKS: nothing outstanding. I'm really disappointed with this dining experience on the whole and have already recommended other steak houses to family and friends.",0.9847,0.785,0.15,0.066,0.578095238095238

2017-05-10,4.0,"Most often when I write a review, I mention the decor, then the food, and then leave a sentence or two at the most about the service. This time, I'm going to break from that structure and start with the service. The bartender invited my mother and I to see the Himalayan sea salt room where they dry age their steaks. Their sommeilier let us taste four different wines before deciding on the one we wanted. And the waiter was incredibly sociable; he even shook my hand at the beginning of the meal. They were also kind enough to give us a cocktail at the bar. I ordered the 42nd Ward with  Bulleit bourbon, combier orange, fresh squeezed orange and lemon, and bitters. I've had a few drinks similar to this, but the difference is using fresh squeezed juice. The drink had the sour of the lemon, the sweetness of the orange, and the bitter from the...ah, you know.  Now onto the quality of the food and beverage. They started us with two pieces of raisin fennel bread. Supposedly, when David Burke's name was removed from the restaurant, they took popovers off the menu and replaced them with this bread. As a huge bread fan, these just aren't my favorite flavors.  I don't order Caesar salad too much, for a pretty obvious reason. It's always the same exact salad. Not at this place. They prepared our Caesar tableside. Anchovies, garlic, dijon, egg, lemon, a few croutons, grated parmesan, and shaved parmesan. It was an incredibly zesty salad and the flavors just jumped. It shows how good a Caesar can be when it's actually done correctly. Also, we spent the extra five dollars for the deep fried crab croutons, which I completely recommend. A little mini crispy crabcake gave the salad the extra dimension it needed to make it special. Of the four wines we tried, we went with L'Ecole 41 Merlot from Columbia Valley in Washington State. It was a full bodied Merlot, but still held up well to the steak. Yet it didn't have that long lingering finish, which I'm glad about. I could note the black cherry hints as well as the blackberries. It was a solid choice. OK, onto the beef. I waited long enough. We ordered the 30 day dry aged porterhouse, and it was a perfect size for two people. A gentleman sliced it for us tableside. We asked for it to be cooked pink, but it came out between rare and medium rare. the center was cooked, but still way too rare. We had to send it back and that's why I'm taking one star off this review. It came back five minutes later, and was much better. Very juicy inside with a distinct char outside. And oh my, those fries. This is how all fries should be prepared. First, they were fresh cut, always the key. Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. They came topped with generous helpings of coarsely ground black pepper, parsley, and Romano cheese. They also came with a side of aioli. Thick aioli. It had a great rich flavor, but oh my goodness, you talk about thick! This aioli was so thick that it would not pour out of the ramekin, I had to use a table knife, and scoop it out. After we declined dessert, they still brought us three small scoops of gelato. My favorite was taking a little bit of vanilla and strawberry and mixing them together. The service and quality of the food are good enough to keep me coming back. I'm thinking I better grab that burger during Happy Hour.",0.9981,0.821,0.155,0.025,0.4770058708414873

2017-04-25,1.0,"""David Burke's Primehouse"" was my go to place for steak - it was otherworldly.  Now David Burke is gone and this ""Primehouse"" has crashed from it's former heights. But this is a review of a steakhouse, so let's get to the only reason anyone reads a review of a steakhouse - the steak.  It started with ordering it - I wanted it ""medium plus"" (between medium and medium well), which I had first heard of AT David Burke's, and was brusquely told ""chef doesn't do that"" - I had to order medium or medium well.  When the steak arrived it was cooked precisely medium well, and had the dry aged flavor I'd come to expect.....but......it had not been trimmed and had an inch of fat on the outer edge, was gristly, stringy, and chewy!  :O   Think of what an aged piece of gristle tastes like - would you pay $64 for that?  And we're not talking a single piece of gristle, we're talking the whole edge of the steak!  Previously we'd been told David Burke's had their own breed of cow.....well he must've taken them with him because I've bought better steaks at Whole Foods!!!   I couldn't believe it!!!  My wife couldn't believe it!!!  The same steak which was previously so buttery and tender that you could cut it with a butter knife (NOT an exaggeration btw) was nowhere near that now!  I've paid less for better steaks at numerous other restaurants!!  It was truly heartbreaking - doubly so since it's clear the aging process was the same and the quality of the meat had dropped so much! Once we'd left, my wife and I discussed our disappointment and while the steak was the prime offender, it was hardly the only one.  We were the first ones there when they opened and they wanted to seat us on a aisle, no one offered to take our coats, the menus used to be in a hefty leather folder and now is a thin piece of paper, the red velvet cake is gone from the menu, the bacon appetizer turned out to be a fatty piece of pork tenderloin with a pork rind on top (who doesn't know the difference between bacon and pork tenderloin?!?!?), the table side Caesar salad was excellent but delivered with the flair of an android, they also changed the anchovies on the salad from a dry anchovy to a wet one (sorry, don't know anchovies but noticed because the wet ones would have drowned the salad in fish juice), the light and buttery popovers are gone, your bread is a single small roll delivered to you by the waiter and that's it.  The ""family style"" mac'n'cheese was the size of my fist (no way you're feeding 2-3 people with THAT), no dessert menu was offered, and the waitress had the personality of an ATM.....a bad one.  All that said, the people never specifically said anything bad, they were just super businesslike and never made it feel like we were welcomed (like they used  to). All in all, it was a thoroughly, crushingly disappointing experience.  We had a 30% off coupon and I'm glad we did!  If I'd paid full price, I'd be livid.  Stay away and go get a better steak somewhere, anywhere else.",-0.8493,0.863,0.063,0.074,0.47290476190476194

Honestly, at that point, why even bother sending it back again?  They clearly just wanted to get the steak out of the kitchen as quickly as possible and they put little to no effort into cooking it the correct way.   I've been going to Burke's for more than 10 years.  After going to the newly updated Primehouse for the first time, I think it is over for me.",0.8972,0.846,0.105,0.049,0.5057720057720058

Both steaks are delicious but I would prefer the 40 Day Ribeye. The size of the steaks were not listed on the menu, but as I remember the server said they were about 16oz? (without the bone) when I asked the server about it. The steak itself makes my stomach feel full. The Miyazaki Sashimi was very disappointing since they were sliced super thin, very small in portion, we could barely taste it because of how thin they were. They were gone in one bite. We asked the manager why the portion was so small and he said they changed the portion because the grade now is higher (A5?) than before. The broccoli (side order) was also quite disappointing since we only got the stems (no crown at all) and the portion was small. What I like was the wine pour was quite generous. The service was a bit slow (consider the restaurant was very quiet at that time), the server almost forgot to bring our oysters, so we had them at the very end of the meal which we thought we could have them as appetizer.

I usually visit Chicago once or twice per year for shopping and restaurants, and I've been to most of the premier steakhouses. The experience at DB's has always been first-rate, regardless of which meal of the day I choose for my visit. Case in point, breakfast last month. A fantastic Mexican version of poached eggs with a homemade corn tortilla, onions, peppers, and potatoes. Fresh and vibrant, it was an unexpected pleasure. The best part came later. You see, DB's has a butcher shop where one may procure those delicious dry-aged steaks for a trip home to grill later. I ordered several burgers (10 oz. of 40 day aged ground prime beef for $5 ea/holy cow that's a deal!) and several steaks to pick up the next day. The manager came out to my table, and asked me what I was planning to do with his steaks?!?!  Turns out he wanted to be certain that I knew what I was getting, and that I would transport ( back to WI), store, and prepare the steaks properly to ensure a great experience. Very smart move, as these steaks have been meticulously aged and if treated casually might be ruined. Brilliant! They vacuum sealed my steaks and burgers, I packed them in ice, and brought them home. I tossed them in the freezer, and have since had both a steak and a burger. Each was unparalleled for depth of flavor, tenderness, and quality.  Bottom line- IF you know how to cook a steak or burger on the grill, you will have the home steak experience of a lifetime.

It was definitely up there amongst some of the best that I have tried.  I ordered the 75 day dry aged ribeye. It was a wonderful cut, tender, almost the consistency of a fine sushi grade tuna steak.

Ultimately, you can't go wrong with any of the ribeyes.  We did also get the tableside caeser salad. Presentation was quick. Flavor was ok. We opted for the additional anchovies. Nice and salty.  The two types of oysters on the half shell where delicious.  We are from Washington state, and the oysters where both from Washington and British Columbia, Canada. Kumamoto oysters are my favorite and they have a nice creamy and subtle sweetness to them. the second oyster, slightly larger, I cannot recall the name, was nice and briny.  The dessert was amazing!

My husband's steak was cooked correctly, but mine was under-done so I set it back to cook for a little longer. It came back the right temperature, but was so heavily charred, I could barely taste the meat through the char. I like a little char on my steak, but I shouldn't need a chisel to get to the steak. My other favorite thing about this place is the cheese popovers they serve before the meal. Mine were not warm at all, which was disappointing. The mixed vegatables also had a few medallions of corn on the cob in them. I accidentally bit into the cob because I wasn't expecting them, and that was very unpleasant.

For being the ""#1 steak in Chicago"", it was too chewy and not the best ribeye cut. If you want the best steak in Chicago, I recommend going to Bavette's for their dry-aged ribeye. The 12oz 55-day dry aged ribeye at David Burke's Primehouse is large enough to share between 2 people with appetizers and sides. Don't waste your money ordering one steak for a single person as it isn't that great anyway. The customer service here is not just below average, it is discriminatory. While we tried to chew our steak we watched our waiter return to and check in with all the tables around us while he only returned to our table to bring us the check. He had an obvious preference about whom he served, and there was no equal treatment among the tables. We will never return to this restaurant and do not recommend it to anyone who is well-versed in dry aged steak and especially if you don't have a certain look you may want to consider another steakhouse who will treat their customers equally. Lastly, don't let the four star ratings fool you.

Two of my girlfriends came here before and they raved about the quality of their steaks so obviously I had high expectations. We ordered the wagyu beef sashimi as an appetizer, a 55-day aged ribeye, as well as the 75-day aged ribeye one. Sadly, I was disappointed. I am aware that the longer a steak was aged, the meatier the flavor it will be; however, I'm pretty certain that it should not result in a severely bitter aftertaste. I took a few more bites and even asked my friend for her opinion - we were both not satisfied with the lack of seasoning/flavor and the aftertaste. We tried the 55-day aged ribeye and it was so much better in the texture and taste. We rarely send back our food in restaurants (especially steakhouses) but we felt the need to this time around. The manager was really accommodating and understanding and even offered us a 40-day aged ribeye to compare with the 55-day aged one. However, it was no comparison. I've never been so disappointed, but decided to pack the remainder of the steak to-go nonetheless.  Hopefully I'm just one of the few customers who received a bad cut of meat. :( I am still open to give the restaurant another try the next time I'm in Chicago!",-0.888,0.802,0.082,0.116,0.5821279761904763

We were sat by a lovely gentleman (I believe a server who was helping the host so we did not need to wait).  We were greeted right away and our server (John) opened our bottle of wine right away for us.  He asked if it was our first time (yes) and walked us through the menu and gave us some suggestions. We ordered lobster bisque and the beef sashimi. Both of those were fantastic.  During our appetizers, Matt (sommelier) stopped by and noticed our wine that we brought (Robert Sinskey SLD). We started chatting with him and he told us that he was familiar with Robert Sinskey wine as they carry the POV (which is very good). After our chat her brought us each a sample of a Chardonnay to go with our appetizers. That was very kind and the wine was great. (Wish I could remember the Chardonnay name) After appetizers our dinner came out. We had the 55 day aged ribeye, it was cooked to perfection and cut beautifully table side. We also got some crab, roasted vegetable and macaroni & cheese. The veggies were ok, but that's ok. The mac & cheese were great, I didn't need to add any seasoning which doesn't usually happen at most restaurants. The crab was very good too. We had so much food John boxed our food Togo. I of course had to get dessert. I debated between the donuts & panna cotta. I asked John for a recommendation and he said the donuts all day. We ordered those and they were very good. I think the only thing I would change on them is I would toss them in cinnamon sugar, but they were excellent with the fillings. It was a great experience and what I expect of a high end restaurant.

The presentation was a nice touch but they used prepackaged croutons and it was just nothing to write home about. I was expecting so much more from Chicago's ""best steakhouse.""

2016-05-17,3.0,"10% off if you check in on Yelp.  We came after the lunch rush on Monday(1:30pm), so we were seated immediately.  55 day dry aged ribeye ($68) - the medium rare rib eye had a bit too much fat, but the bold flavors and juiciness made up for it.  Black pepper fries ($9)- crispy, fresh, and not oily which is great, but the sauce they provided on the side did not go well with it. (HUGE PORTION) Rib-eye sandwich ($17) - comes with a huge serving of onion rings.  The meat was juicy, but the combination of flavors seemed a bit off with the sauce. Overall, it's worth trying if you want to experience the ""day dry aged"" ribeye, but it was not worth the $68 and no where near the top best rib eyes I've ever had.",0.9752,0.781,0.186,0.032,0.4805555555555557
2016-05-12,3.0,"Not quite sure if Chicago is known for steak, but after my trip, I'm assuming it is not. The description for my 40 day ribeye states ""rich BEEF flavor, bone-in."" From the taste and look of it, I thought it was the 28 day ribeye. Its description, ""rich MARBLING, BONE-IN,"" suited my steak better. My friend who also ordered the same dish was even more disappointed than I was and he is hard to disappoint with meat!  I'm glad my other friend ordered his filet mignon, even after I kept pressuring him to order the day-aged steaks, because he would've been disappointed. His steak was cooked the way he wanted - rare.  However, my other friend, who also ordered a filet, received his rare as well when he had actually wanted it medium. Additionally, I'm used to restaurants letting me taste the wine before pouring me an entire glass. However, my waiter did not allow me that courtesy and brought over a wine that I was hesitant ordering. I didn't want to waste the wine, but I was thoroughly displeased. I forced myself to drink it, since wasting food or alcoholic beverages is usually frowned upon! The service was a little on the slow side. The steaks were okay. My steak was cooked perfectly fine, even with the chunks of fat. Overall, 3 stars, but minus 1 star for the wine mishap.   This place is like any other steakhouse I've been to in other major cities and I would've preferred saving my money and experiencing other food in Chicago.",0.9716,0.707,0.179,0.115,0.48018518518518516

The steak was one of the best I've ever had and I grew up on a cattle ranch in Montana. I was honestly not expecting it to be that good and it wasn't even a top cut. Apparently dry aging with 1,000 year out Himalayan sea salt is the way to go.  The fries were very good and not too greasy. They did need a little salt.

2016-04-27,2.0,I've been a yelp user for a long time but never felt the need to actually write a review. This was such a disappointment! My husband and I have tried pretty much every steakhouse in the city and none have been more hyped up than David Burkes.  We came with a group of five for a 7 o'clock reservation. We were running late and even when we arrived we still had to wait another 20 minutes. Our waiter was nice. Very informative and friendly. Gave us great drink pairing recommendations.  We all of course ordered steak. My husband and I love ribeyes while the rest of the group prefer and ordered filets. I always order medium rare. How did the steak come out well? My husbands medium rare came out rare and the filets were actually cooked perfectly at medium. The flavor can be compared to a steak from Applebee's. I didn't eat even half of my steak and didn't bother bringing the rest home. My husband is pretty much a bottomless pit so he ate everything but he said at 64 bucks he wasn't leaving one bite.  Our bill was close to 500 dollars before tip and it was without a doubt the worst steak I've had from a windy city steakhouse. I'd suggest Benny's Chop house for a mouth watering steak.,0.9929,0.792,0.19,0.018,0.5916666666666667

2016-04-09,5.0,"WOW. Oustanding.  My friends, family, and I went to celebrate a special event here. Food, service, and atmosphere were all outstanding.  We were greeted by a warm host staff and seated promptly. Drink orders included an IPA, Mojito, and Gin martini. The cocktails were perfectly made. You could literally just come here for drinks and achieve satisfaction. Appetizers included the beef sashimi, dumplings, and shrimp cocktail. You can't go wrong with any single one. My favorite of the three was certainly the sashimi;  light, flavorful and appropriately complemented by aioli and crustini. A great way to whet your palate and prepare for delicious dry aged beef. The table collectively ordered the 40, 55, and 75 day dry aged rib eyes. Perfectly cooked to desired temperature. As a simple tip choose the age based on how much dry age flavor you want. I personally enjoyed the 40 day as I think this offered a compromise between the juicyness of fresh red meat and rich dry age flavor. Oh, and the black pepper fries should not be ignored. Finally for dessert. Fill your own donuts and ice cream. If you could spare the calories and have the room then order both. Order. Both. Trust me. The donut holes were obviously fresh made and served warm.  You are provided with three different sauces to fill each one to your liking. Delicious. I must compliment our servers who paid extra attention to detail in providing us close service. They were sure to make sure our glasses were never empty without offering the next round. They perfectly timed the courses and allowed for a truly luxurious Chicago steakhouse experience. You won't be disappointed.  Cheers.",0.998,0.7,0.289,0.012,0.6462599206349207

It should never have been sent to our table. What were they thinking, that we wouldn't notice? Table-side caesar salad was fine, as were the deserts. Service good, but place was nearly empty anyway.

After talking to some colleagues of mine, they insisted we go to David Burke's Primehouse located in the James Hotel. The ambiance of the restaurant was relaxing, calm and very enjoyable - the perfect setting for a romantic dinner for two. Our Waiter, Jeremy, was as professional and as attentive as they come without being overbearing. He made great suggestions and had a really enjoyable personality. We tried a plethora of food and were not disappointed whatsoever. To start, we ordered the wagyu beef sashimi which was creamy and melted in our mouths along with the black pepper fries that were addicting. For dinner, I got the filet cooked MR and my boyfriend ordered the 55 day ribeye cooked MR. The filet was amazing but his ribeye was like nothing we have ever tasted before. Great cut of meat and the flavors spoke volumes. This is a must when dining there. As sides we had the grain risotto which at first sounded ehh but was our favorite side dish, the mac and cheese which and the broccolini as the vegetable. Then as if we needed any more, the Restaurant Manager Nathan Escue sent over donuts and a cake pop tree for dessert! We managed to finish the dessert it was so good. Nathan then made our experience unforgettable by taking us downstairs to see the dry aging room.

My next birthday I'm going for the 70.  Other Chicago steakhouses such as Gene and Georgetti's, Wild Fire, Webber's etc all order their stakes from a 3rd party, and they aren't BAD steaks. But David Burke's raises their own steers in Kentucky just for David Burke's restaurants (I think there are 5 total?). They dry age in the basement in a room lined with salt blocks. They will give you a tour after your meal if you'd like.  Also, try the hand made salad/salad dressing. They make it table side.  Steaks are awesome. Service has had some bumpy patches a couple of times, like a waitress reaching over me and my plate for a glass. But all in all I can't say it is worthy of deducting a star.

We put in orders for appetizers and salads, and also did the entree and side orders.  Since it was ala carte, I wish the server would have indicated what sides had been ordered by the other 'half' of the table (with a group of 10 you couldn't hear what was being said).  We ended up with 3 orders of broccolini, and many other duplicates, that we likely would have better shared if there had been indication that the other half of the table had already ordered it.  Instead the server encouraged us to just order more, which I get from a business standpoint means more money, but it was also annoying. The Cesar salads came out first, but they made it all table-side, so they brought this big cart out with the fixin's and then you had to sit there for 10 minutes and watch them make the salad.  Okay, I get it's the experience, but we were hungry at that point and it felt like a tease.  Then finally gave the Cesar salads out, and then about 5-10 minutes later brought out the other salads and the appetizers, so the timing was poor there as well. Same thing at the end of the dinner, we had to sit around for quite a while and then had to flag down the server to get the check.  I can appreciate not being rushed, but this was a bit excessive. I have to say, ask for the tour of the salt room where they age the meat, it's pretty cool.  That was likely the best part.",0.9655,0.859,0.104,0.037,0.514186507936508

Like another Yelper, I ordered it medium rare, but when I cut into it, it was more medium well!  I also do not ever send food back, but since we were paying top dollar for the steak, it may as well be done right. The manager did replace the steak but not without arguing it was ""on the border of being medium rare."" Of note,  when he shined his flashlight, it was clearly overcooked. The replacement steak was cooked correctly but I also agree that there was nothing special in terms of seasoning.  My husband ordered the chicken (yes I know...chicken at a steak house?). I guess not surprisingly it was just ok, if not a tad on the salty/oily side. We ordered the donuts for dessert. Good, but nothing special.",0.9817,0.771,0.17,0.06,0.5939594356261024
2016-01-04,2.0,"Came here on New Year's Day as we were in the mood for a great steak.  I had read about David Burke's in Chicago Magazine and happened to be close by.  Wanting to also try somewhere we had not been before, and seeing 4 stars on Yelp, off to the restaurant we went.   For some background:  My points of reference are places like Capital Grille, Joe's, Ruth's Chris, Flemings, Wildfire, and Fogo de Chao.  Sadly, I had better experiences in each and every one of those places, mostly at a lower price point.  The food at David Burke's was simply below average and plain, which may have been enough to salvage 3 stars, but when combined with the strange almost casual ambience, unimpressive and seemingly disinterested service, high prices, and the fact that one of our steaks was significantly undercooked, I most certainly will not return when our city has so many other good options.  On to the food: Wagyu beef ""sashimi"" - Served on a slab of Himalayan salt and probably the best thing we ate.  Off to a good start, no complaints. Crab cakes - nothing like a traditional crab cake. That would be fine had we seen a description or had our waiter tell us more about them.  Regardless, they were a bit strange and we did not particularly care for the flavor.  Things were still looking ok as we were looking ahead to hopefully delicious steaks. Dry aged ribeye - what they are known for - not worth the price.  I would call it an average 3 star steak and I would put it at or near the bottom of the other steak houses I mentioned.  Certainly at the bottom when price is considered. Filet mignon - looked promising and appetizing...until it was cut into.  It was ordered medium and was significantly undercooked.  I typically order my steak medium rare and would have considered sending it back if I had ordered it at that level.  Needless to say it was sent back.  Waiter did not apologize, he looked bored as he asked ""is that a little too pink for you?"" I should have told him ""No it's not ""too pink"" - it's mostly red, significantly undercooked to the point of almost disgusting my wife, and where is your manager so I can tell him about the lovely experience we are having!"" Anyway, as you may have guessed,  the steak was dry and unappetizing when it returned.   That's all folks, at least we won't be curious about this place anymore...and can help our friends steer clear of it as well.",0.9879,0.775,0.143,0.081,0.5400004008337342

Tables and lighting don't have an upscale feeling you expect from the better steakhouses I've been to.  Waiter was pretty cold and robotic. Asked if we wanted drinks, plopped menus down right away. Came back with drinks and seemed rushed to take our orders right away. No feeling of letting us enjoy the evening at our pace. Appetizers came out timely and then unfortunately the steaks came out pretty soon after.  Again, the better steakhouses around don't make you feel rushed at all. Waiter never suggested ordering wine...had to ask for it. You'd think he'd like to try and sell a bottle or two. Now for the good. Ordered the 40 day aged bone in ribeye and it was fantastic. One of the best steaks I've ever had. My girlfriend ordered the filet and raved all night about it. Desserts were fabulous...the donuts and the pears with ice cream.

Having worked in steakhouses for years, I know the difference between each cut, dry vs. wet aged, grass fed vs. grain fed.  At David Burke's they keep everything in house, their own cattle, their own butcher's, their own dry aging process, which by the way, you can tour if you ask. The quality and flavoring are a cut above most prime steakhouses. Let's get down to it. I love bone-in filet mignon. Not all places carry them, but David Burke's does. It was fantastic! I also tried their bone-in ribeye, aged for about 28 days, I believe. It was more complex (the flavors) than any other steak I can remember. They also have a very good burger...if you can take a nap at some point after lunch :) Another must try is their maple-bacon appetizer. It was....special.

We came in on a busy Saturday night with a full dining room with a couple of large dinner parties and our service time and food quality was impeccable! We had ordered the beef sashimi and the Kobe corn dogs for appetizers and that arrived promptly. The beef sashimi came on a brick of salt (Himalayan salt) and upon arrival our server and explained to us that the salt brick will add flavor but the longer the beef sashimi sat on the salt the saltier it would be and he was on point! We took our time with the beef sashimi between the appetites' initial arrival and our wine and the corn dogs and noticed the transformation. The beef sashimi is a must have!  Despite a busy night, the courses were timed impeccably! Few minutes after they cleared our appetizers and app plates, our 40 day Ribeyes arrived on a cart and was cut for us! We ordered Medium Rare and Medium Rare it was! We loved it, so juicy and amazingly flavored!  We never got our servers name but he made excellent recommendations on our wine and menu selection and was absolutely on point. He wasn't overbearing or overly friendly but was very knowledgable. Some restaurants rely on their level of service in fine dining but like I said earlier we were pleasantly surprised.

2015-12-17,1.0,"Before tonight, David Burke's was my favorite restaurant in Chicago - bar none.  I have been there approx. 20 times mostly for dinner (all but a few were business) with a couple of weekend brunches thrown into the mix. I have been to the salt/dry age room and heard the stories about the original steer.   So, it pains me to report how bad my experience was tonight with my mother.  Initially, we went to Mastros because they had a better time slot but Mastros was too loud for my mom so I happily suggested we leave and head to David Burke's which is where i originally wanted to go. I wanted to give her a taste of what I thought was the best. The evening started fine at the bar - the bartender made great Manhattans. Once seated, we ordered a shrimp cocktail which was fine and 2 lobster bisque soups.  The soup was bad -- so much cream that it was beige.  Likewise, the addition of corn and potatoes added very little in taste except being filler so that more lobster does not have to be added.  My mom did not even like the lobster spring roll as it was mostly fried wonton without much filling. Moving to the main courses, I ordered the 55 day dry aged ribeye, the steak that I have argued is the finest in the city and beyond.  My mom ordered the bone in filet.  Both steaks were bad!  Both were incredibly tough. Mom's tasted burnt - it was supposed to be butterflied as she ordered it medium well and it was not.  However, that would not have saved the bad cut of meat that it was.  My ribeye was equally dreadful.  Tough, undercooked (I ordered medium and it was medium rare at best).  The only taste was Rosemary not the buttery melt in your mouth taste that I have had previously.  Normally, you cut into a steak and there is juice flowing from the meat,  Not so, no juice whatsoever,  frankly, I don't know what I was served but it was not anything resembling a good cut of meat.   Our sides - onion rings and sautéed greens were equally bad. The onion rings  - while in a tasty batter were cold and difficult to eat.  The greens were just a disaster - they simply were not made from fresh greens but were from frozen veggies that can be masked when creamed but are exposed when requested to be sautéed.  Given how bad meal was, we skipped dessert. Finally, our server, while professional, had the warmth of an ice cube.  No engagement and certainly no excitement about the meal or menu.  It was almost as if she knew that the dining experience was below par. Although DB still charges first rate prices, the food quality is now subpar.  I would recommend that DB be avoided at all costs particularly given the number of very good steakhouses in Chicago.",-0.9897,0.74,0.095,0.165,0.5983386243386244

Overall, the place brands itself as high end, but delivers sub-par experience. I believe it's the staff. The waiter was snarky and rude, and undertrained for this type of clientele. He continually tried to sell us more without ensuring we were satisfied with what we had.  The sommelier looked like he just rolled out of bed, and when we curiously asked who David Burke was, he just said ""he's our celebrity chef,"" and walked away. Way to sell the place! Again, undertrained.  From undertrained front to over cooked back of house, I would stay away. Maybe the ""celebrity chef"" needs to spend more time on his human resources, or more money.

After coming in on a Monday night, we were promptly seated and we ordered our food. We decided to split a 40 day dry aged rib eye steak medium rare as we had eaten two hours before, as well as a steak tartare. We also got a side of mushrooms and risotto to pair with our steak. For bread, we received popovers which were delicious! Super light and fluffy, yet soft and moist on the inside. Yum.  The steak tartare was a great start- nothing spectacular but a good solid dish as an appetizer. Wish I got the Wagyu beef sashimi instead, as it seems more unique. When our steak came out, and after eating a piece, we immediately noticed that the meat was medium well. Brown with a slight hint of pink in the middle. Definitely overcooked. As a fan of juicy,succulent meat, we both did not want to eat the steak as medium well does not exude the flavor and taste that a medium rare does. The beef was very well seasoned and tasted great- just like a dry aged, but it was just too chewy for our taste. I've never done this before, but I complained to the manager about our overcooked steak, and he took it back and gave us a new one. This new one was perfectly medium rare, but it was lacking seasoning. You can tell from the two photos I took of the steaks that both were prepared differently, and this new steak did not taste like a dry aged. It was rather... bland. We didn't finish this steak either, and ended up taking it to-go and giving it to my friend's dog.....  For a restaurant renowned for their dry aged steaks, they definitely did not meet our expectations. We were SO disappointed by the lack of quality control at the back of house in terms of consistency.

However, it wasn't even pink in the center.  When my second steak came, it was rare plus... But cold in the middle.

2015-11-12,4.0,"We are usually skeptical about restaurants attached to fancy hotels as we tend to think that they are meant for people on business trips willing to expense overpriced mediocre meals on the company's golden Amex. Upon walking in I must say I really like the ambience. Nice and cozy with dimmed lighting but not too dark (at some places I can hardly read the menu). Service is also topnotch that everyone was warm, friendly, and attentive. For the appetizer we ordered a wedge salad to share and they very nicely just split it into two plates for us. I think it's one of the best wedge salads I've ever had (the other one is also at a steakhouse called Prime and Provisions), but at the same time I don't have resistance for anything with bleu cheese and bacon, so maybe you shouldn't take my word for it....  Then they served us this bread puff that just smelled way too good. I was actually on a hardcore minimal carbs diet and I couldn't resist. Ahhhhhh. It's the worst. Then for the steaks we both ordered a 55 day rib eye, which is apparently the best dry-aged steak (like on the whole planet?). I ordered it medium rare and my date just had it rare. I gotta say when it comes to fancy dry-aged steaks, the rarer you can go the better. I enjoyed mine for sure, it was nice and flavorful, but a tad on the dry side. The rare version of it, however, is just pure bomb.  Take home point: order your steak as rare as you can handle it!",0.9889,0.802,0.159,0.039,0.6236531986531987

The steak was prepared the way I asked, which is medium. However, I expected a much better steak at a high end steak house. The quality and flavor didn't justify the price this time. I normally have no problem paying for good food and I have ate steak at many other high end places for slightly less money. We also ordered a bunch of sides.

2015-11-08,5.0,"Situated in the very center of the city, at the James Hotel.  Interesting eccentric ambience with leather tablecloths, bricks of Himalayan salt hanging from the walls, booths, dimmed light - that all make the place look cozy. Himalayan salt on the tables of course, not just a regular sea salt.  Bread is very delicious, looks like a cake, freshly baked and served in a small pan.  Since it's a steakhouse, I'm not going to tell anything about their seafood and fish selection, though they have this all including crab, oysters and lobsters. But that's not why you come to this steakhouse.   For starters try unusual Wagyu beef Sashimi or a classic Steak Tartar, both are memorably creative and dainty. The size of portions is pretty small; not the price, but ... it's the quality and innovation. As for the main meat: they are famous for their ""Salt Brick Beef"" and this is why you choose this steakhouse among different others, coming to Chicago. They have 75, 55 40 and 28 days aged ribeye. They age it a Himalayan salt-tiled room on premise. It tastes so different, marble-marvel, so flavorful, succulent and rich, that you have to try. Even I, who likes it the most tender with my minimum of Filet Mignon, all the time that I come - order nothing else than this dry aged ""salt brick beef"".  My favorite is 55 days. That is definitely more expensive than an average price, but here it's unique and they charge for it. Also we asked for Béarnaise Sause and blue cheese crumbles as accompaniments. And of course they have pork, lamb chops and chicken.   They didn't have my favorite Creamed Spinach in the menu, but when I asked our server - the kitchen cooked it and with bacon and shallots it was flavorous and tasty.   Whimsical choice for desserts like a lollypop tree or Kickin' Donuts. I personally prefer something more classical, not that bizarre. Ricotta cheesecake is nice or try artisan cheese selection.   The wine list is fairly typical for a premium steak house, although the price range is higher than you would expect. Of the special features I'd like to mention a wide selection of beers, a decent selection of wine by the glass. And of course as increasingly getting popular proposal cellar glas pours via Corvin, you can try a glass of such as Chateau Lafite-Rotchild 1976 for 250$ (3oz) or BV Reserve Georges de Latour 1973 for 70$.

2015-11-05,2.0,"We went into Chicago for a meeting and for lunch decided to finally try what we had heard was about the best ""luxury"" hamburger in town, reportedly here at David Burke's Primehouse in the St. James Hotel. This rating seemed reasonable since they supposedly have great steaks and even age their meat in a salt lined room (somehow that sounds like a good idea). That certainly suggests dedication to maximizing the meat lover's gastronomic experience, right? Well, it turned out to be a major (as in *massive*) disappointment. First of all they charged us $6 for bread because it was lunchtime. I guess it's more expensive to serve bread at lunch. It was a couple of crunchy popovers and some toast. It was tasty but not worth $6 (of course we were ravenous and would have eaten the tablecloth had the bread been unavailable--so maybe $6 was reasonable given the fibrous alternative). The burger though was not worth $16. Not even close. Sure, it was pretty, and cooked to a proper medium rare, but it was way, way too lean. It was about as juicy as a bowl of corn flakes without milk. Seriously. My partner was surprised when a cloud of dust didn't erupt when she took her first bite. If a burger doesn't even begin to drip some juice how can it have much flavor? Prime's burger was weirdly tasteless. It was like the cow had been raised on cardboard. And not even cardboard that had held produce at some point but rather something like, well, shoes maybe. You get the point. We both agreed, however, that the pepper fries were excellent.

2015-09-24,5.0,"A Top Chef Master in his own right, Chef Burke's got a clear passion for beef. So much so that he was the first chef to own his own bull. Named Prime 207L, or simply Prime, this is the Black Angus bull that's sired the foundation for high-quality steaks. In fact, despite Prime's passing, his sperm has been frozen to continue the line of beef. Rye-P-A [$16] Templeton rye, absinthe, bitters, orange, IPA   After a long day of conferencing, I decided to start off with the Rye-P-A. I usually only drink stouts if I'm opting for beer, but was intrigued by the potential balance of the IPA with the orange and absinthe. Coupled with the stiffness of the rye whiskey, we're talking about a smooth tipple that comes through with floral citrus notes. Bread Service Gruyere popover, butter with Himalayan sea salt A la BLT Steak in NY, there's nothing I enjoy more than a popover to start. This was one of the best I've had. Perfectly portioned with a nicely crisp texture on the outside, this was studded with salty hits of cheesy Gruyere. Once opened, the bread within was fluffy and just hot enough to melt the room temperature butter, which was topped with pink specks of Himalayan sea salt. Delicious.  Bacon [$12] Slaw, black pepper, maple syrup    I had to get David Burke's bacon dish (this is the Chef who had his own bacon bar!). And I'm glad I did. In fact, consider this one of my last meal dishes. Previous iterations of this dish were presented in ""cake pop"" fashion and I'm glad they did away with it in favor of this more beautifully presented spectacle of pork. The belly was incredibly flavorful, with the sweetness from the maple syrup rendering it into bacon candy. There was a nice outer crisp as well, which helped to provide some textural balance. There was a valiant attempt by the crisp red cabbage and pea tendril slaw to cut through the heft of the pork, but the richness of the unctuous belly could not be denied, Seriously the best steakhouse bacon I've ever had, even over Peter Luger's. Ridiculously delicious and a must order.  At this point, the kitchen gifted me with the caesar salad with add-on's. Perhaps they were attempting to provide some levity to my meal, which regular readers know centers around carnivorous tendencies. The salad's expertly crafted tableside, with the option of adding on delectable crab croutons or white anchovies to impart some bright salinity to the dressing. Caesar Salad [$14] + White Anchovies [$3] + Crab Croutons [$5]  The greens were perfectly dressed, with a great depth of flavor from the just-made dressing. The hits of salt from the Parmesan Reggiano and the tasty morsels of lumb crab in the crisp croutons helped to provide additional savoriness to each bite.  75 Day Dry-Aged Ribeye [$79] 20 oz salt brick beef   But really, I was here for the dry-aged beef. They offer several steaks, including the standard 28-day as well as 35, 40 and 55-day aged steaks. But I was here for the bad boy, the 75-day. Dry-aged using Chef Burke's patented Himalayan salt brick process, this 20 ounce bone-in ribeye was cooked nicely medium-rare.  There was a clear beefy funk that was highly reminiscent of blue cheese, but with a buttery tenderness to the beef due to the tissue breakdown. In fact, the beef finished with a sweetness that was reminiscent of elk. This was delicious and well-executed in that the beef really shined over any overt seasoning or butter one may expect from your more typical steakhouses. Mac n Cheese [$9] Camembert, cheddar, bread crumbs   I couldn't stop there - especially when there was mac n cheese on the menu. The noodles were nicely al dente and the melange of sharp cheddar and the funky umami of the Camembert helped to create a creamy and delicious bite.  At this point, I was excited to tour the dry-aging room, clearly designated and locked, with the official patent proudly displayed.  Manager Tommy Livingston (often mistaken for the Chef!), described the aging process and proudly highlighted the various cuts, including the ribeyes and the lard, which is aged as well. Apparently, the fat is melted and brushed onto their incredible dry-aged burger. They're even in the process of dry-aging pork, which'll make for an interesting treat.  They still had one of their original steaks on display, representing almost a decade of aging! You can see how much of the actual beef gets eaten away during the process. Amazing, though probably not entirely edible.  So if you're in Chicago and looking for a proper steak experience, look no further than David Burke's Primehouse. And if you're interested in trying more nuanced flavors compared to your standard 28-day dry-aged ribeye, the 75-day is the way to go.

Ordered the 40 day dry aged prime steak cheddar burger done medium rare $16 with peppered fries $1 extra: the fries came with an aioli sauce and was a good compliment to the fries. Maybe I chose the wrong type of cheese because the burger turn out very salty. My boyfriend ordered the 55 day dry aged ribeye $68 with basil whipped mash potatoes $9 and onion rings $9 (among the 2 sides the mashed potatoes stood out the most. Exactly what you expect from a high end steak house full of cream and butter). The onion rings were good portion, however it was over cooked. The breading was burnt on most rings and it became unappetizing after a few rings. Disappointing especially since they cost $9. The steak lived up to the reputation of having a bold beefy flavor. He asked for medium rare which was perfectly cooked and proved to be a decent portion. Ordered the Caesar salad with crab croutons and white anchovies $23: It was served table side and the server was really nice and knowledgable. We said to give us the works, without leaving anything out, and he did not disappoint. Everything you can think of to make a classic Caesar, anchovy paste, mustard, cheese, chili oil, olive oil, eggs, chives, and more cheese and peppers.

I ordered a glass of Saxum for $90 a glass. Well worth it, paired great with the steak. Again ordered Kosta Browne and as always this was a great pairing w/the bacon.  Dessert: cheesecake pops. Super good & fun. Forgot that I actually saw a review of these on food network or similar channel. Also gave us some complimentary strawberry chews. This was like fresh jam mixed w/gelatin to make a gummy square.  Service: 1st class all the way. Ramon was our server.

I didn't care for the ""unconventional"" pretzel crab cake. We ordered veggie tempura side, and it was over fried two shades too dark, or the oil was too old.

There is nothing wrong with going to dinner like that, but it took away from the feeling that I was going somewhere special with my husband.  The service was excellent. Our appetizer - bacon on a stick was the best bacon I have EVER had. It was a great start to the night. But, then when our filets came out - what a disappointment.

When management realized I was unhappy, they were quick to speak to me. That leads directly into what was bad. Management had trouble understanding how I was unhappy because they were ""a very well know steakhouse in Chicago"". Let me be clear, I love Chicago and want to move back. It's the best city in the U.S. But it has terrible steak. Drive an hour and a half north to Milwaukee and Corpers will top anything Chicago has. 2.5 hours and you have Frankie and Izzies or St Elmos (same kitchen) which can compete with NY and LA. So defending yourself with ""we are the best in Chicago"" is like saying ""i won the special Olympics"". My ribeye was fat free and tasteless. Not what people want from a ribeye.   Mushrooms had balsamic vinegar on them. If you are doing something with meat or Mushrooms that is not found in Childs' or Hazan's cookbooks, ask yourself if it's wise. Mushrooms bring depth and umami, best accented with cream, smoke, or sweetness (Marsala) not balsamic vinegar. Never go to this place. They believe they are great, but they are terrible. If you are in Chicago and like meat, Lowry's can't be beat. If you want a steak, just travel to Indy. If you INSIST on having steak in Chicago (unwise) go to Bavette. That is good.

My husband wanted to have a real Chicago steakhouse experience while we are visiting Chicago on a combined business/pleasure trip.  The concierge recommended David Burke's as a high-quality, local restaurant.   The food ranged from excellent to pretty good.  My husband enjoyed his aged steak and salad immensely.  IOur dessert was excellent (coconut bits of cake with mango sorbet).  My pork chop was good; the accompanying veggies were flavorful, but a little too oily.   Service and other aspects of our experience were subpar.  Our waiter desperately needed some careful coaching about how to interact with diners at a high-end restaurant.  He was brusque, at best.  After we were seated, he swooped over with menus, plopped them on the table and said he'd be back.  It took us awhile to figure out what we wanted, and the waiter did return a couple of times to see if he could take our order.  But his manner was choppy and quick...as if he had too much to do and didn't have time to pay attention to our questions.   My wine order was painful, which is surprising given the extensive wine list that the restaurant has.  I asked for a recommendation for a white wine to go with my pork chop.  The waiter suggested red, and when I asked if he thought red would go better with the pork than white, he responded (brusquely) that he only liked red wines and couldn't recommend a white one.  What??!!!  He did offer to bring me a taste of a tempranillo, which was delicious, but I didn't think it would go well with pork.  So, I asked a few other questions and, long story short, the sommelier wound up coming over to help.  But the wines he brought--and described as dry and mineral-y--were sweet.   I finally just picked a rosé, which was OK, but not what I really wanted.  After figuring out the wine, a server delivered some tasty popovers, and just as soon as we finished swooped back to remove our dishes.  It felt more like the efficient service you'd expect at a busy diner.   When we finished our dinner, our plates were removed, but the table was not cleaned of crumbs or the damp from our water glasses...a pet peeve of mine, but one I especially find irritating in expensive restaurants.   Dessert, which we shared, was great tasting, but we were given tablespoon-size spoons.  We really should have been given teaspoons.",0.9951,0.802,0.165,0.034,0.4800653594771242

First we had a discussion with the waiter about how I like a medium-rare steak, while hubby prefers medium, but at 18 oz., there was no way we were not going to share. He kept saying we could request ""one temperature"". We agreed I would get my way and if hubby couldn't hang, he could send his half back. What we got was 18 oz. of leather. I usually don't send things back,  but a $64 steak? Hell yeah! The waiter took one look at it and promptly took it away. What he brought back was a big, cold, bloody mess. I ate around the edges in fear of getting food poisoning. Seriously, if you are going to age a steak in a room of Himalayan salt for 40 days, why would you not hire someone who can figure out that medium-rare is a HOT, red center?! Don't give me this mumbo-jumbo about ""temperatures"", especially if you don't know off the top of your head what temperature medium rare is (I asked the waiter and he couldn't say).

It was served with the perfect char on the outside, and was perfectly grilled and served medium, it had nice pink center. The fries were crispy and hot, and so were the onion rings. And the rings and fries were also golden. How about that for a concept, golden crispy fries and rings? who would of thunk?  By the way, everyone in the 8 person party enjoyed the food tremendously. Not a single complaint, and everything was cooked as ordered, and was perfect. The steak was out of this world and is one of the best I have ever eaten.

I felt like they could have done a better job making it clear it was the restaurant, it looked like just the hotel bar. Plus there was only a few people dining. I guess I was expecting it to be much more popular.  Inside is all tan leather booths, chairs, and even tan leather table covers. It's a bit much, kinda creepy dining on skin.  I checked in on Yelp after we were seated and got a 10% off deal on breakfast or lunch, score!  We tried the 40 day dry aged prime steak burger with pepper and parsley fries, and the lobster roll with tempura vegetables.  The burger was soooo incredibly salty. I really wish I sent it back. The patty itself was really good, probably one of the best I've had. However, the rest of the burger was salt. Black pepper and parsley fries were a hit. The lobster roll was decent. I liked that the mayo dressing didn't overpower the lobster. I could taste the lobster, and fresh ingredients like the celery and cherry tomatoes. I didn't like the roll itself much, sort of bland and dry. Tempura vegetables were uninteresting.  Our server was really friendly, I liked him a lot. However, when it came time to pay we showed him the yelp deal, he said he needed to get his manager. That's when it went from mediocre to downhill for me.  I really wanted to get out of there, we had the city to go explore. It took FOREVER for the manager to come. Our server apologized a couple times and said she was busy on the phone. I don't have the patience for this kind of shit. I didn't even feel like the 10% off was worth it, but it was on principal that I stayed. When she finally came all she did was say hi, look at the deal, then said she'll go take it off. So why the f$&k couldn't our server just do that if she was going to be on the phone for a while??

Maybe I just had too high expectations but I wasn't too impressed with the steak. It was good but it wasn't amazingly life-changing.  The side dishes were very good, the whipped potatoes were very light and fluffy.  I'd certainly give this place another shot, but I think i'd try other steakhouses around Chicago since there are so many to choose from.",0.9924,0.81,0.166,0.023,0.6152675736961452

I  forgot her name but we had a sub-par experience.  We came on a gilt voucher this time and when I let her know then she snatched up our menus quickly to bring the 'gilt menus.' I understand that vouchers can be annoying to servers .. etc but we are regular diners at the restaurant and ordered more than just the voucher menu, we should not feel like the service should be turned down a notch when dining on a voucher.  ANYWAYS, we ordered an extra lobster bisque, it was delicious as always. The wagyu beef sashimi was REALLY salty and the toast that accompanied it was BURNT.  I had an extra pop-over I was saving and someone snatched it and took it away from our table without even asking.  The table side caesar salad was quite good and fresh. The steaks just keep losing flavor.  I remember the first time I dined here over a year ago and the flavor was just amazing.  It just tasted very bland.. and the sides were eh. We took a bite of the steak and took it home for leftovers.. the bf had the steak for lunch the next day. He was sick the rest of the day.  I did not not eat the steak at home and we had had the same food for the last 24hrs so I know that it was his steak that made him sick.  I ended up throwing my whole steak away because I did not want to risk any food poisoning at all.  I am very disappointed in the restaurant.  I liked the atmosphere and the food a lot because it was still up-scale but more modern with everything.  I am now on the search for a new-favorite steak restaurant.",-0.4992,0.838,0.076,0.086,0.4369923982827209

2015-03-27,3.0,"I was happy and for the most part satisfied with my experience at this steak house. We had a reservation but the place was not as packed as I expected at 8pm on a Friday night. We were confused upon entering since the restaurant is located in a hotel. We did not know that when we were arriving, but it only took a minute to figure it all out. My boyfriend and I got seated at an awkward table that faced the doors into the kitchen; did not like it one bit. My boyfriend asked to be moved to a different table as the bustling of the waiters going in and out of those doors was distracting and honestly just a buzzkill. Although the booth they switched us to was not much better since now we were sitting along the see through wall that was next to the kitchen doors. We decided to let it go and try to enjoy our evening.  Our waiter, I wish I remembered his name, was polite and informative. He helped us pick cocktails and gave us recommendations on appetizers. We were in the mood for oysters so we started with those. They had four oyster options, 1 west coast and 3 east coast oysters. They were so good! I have decided that I am definitely an east coast oyster girl. Loved the oysters here!  For our entrees, I ordered the filet mignon cooked to medium, and my boyfriend ordered the 40 day dry aged ribeye steak. We also ordered two sides: broccolini and macaroni and cheese. The server did inform us that the broccolini they were offering was not their normal broccolini but a more bitter tasting one but that it was still good. We ordered it anyway, but when it came to the table we tried it and we did not like it one bit and the waiter was kind enough to replace it with brussel sprouts, which were fantastic. The mac and cheese was delicious!  Our steaks were cooked perfectly! So much flavor! My filet was simple but melted in my mouth! The food was great! The reason I am giving this place 3 stars:  1) We ordered 8 oysters. We did not want a whole dozen but we wanted more than a half dozen. So we asked the waiter that we wanted to order the half dozen plus order 2 extra oysters at their single price (3.50 an oyster). He said that was no problem. Obviously if you order half dozen it is a few dollars cheaper than order each single oyster. Although the waiter said he was going to ring it up at the half dozen price and then add on two single oysters separate when we got our bill he rang up all 8 oysters at their single price. Quite disappointed. We actually did not bring it up although I feel like we should have.  2) I think I have a thing with hotel restaurants. It completely changes the vibe of your experience knowing that the restaurant is inside a hotel. It made it feel less exclusive and special. I looked around at other patrons and some were wearing t-shirts and tennis shoes and all I could think about was that they were probably hotel guests that just stumbled downstairs to eat dinner at the hotel restaurant.",0.9917,0.825,0.116,0.058,0.4945542046605879

For dessert they brought us red velvet cake batter - yummy. And the cake which was quite good as far as red velvet cakes go.

2015-03-10,1.0,"Wow I can honestly say save your money.  I never ever would give a restaurant a zero but they deserve it.  Let me start with we were a party of 8 and 6 of us arrived together.  They would not seat us until the entire party arrived.  Instead we first blocked the entry, then we were blocking the bar and crowding a couple having dinner at the bar, then we were blocking the servers near a large party.  We then complained and asked to talk to the manager (as this was ""company policy not to seat anyone until the full party was present"").  Well it took the manager about 5 minutes to see us but then agreed to seat us. I am going to jump ahead to the major issues and not detail the minor items.  My dinner (chicken) was forgotten when everyone was served, 4 of the 7 steaks were not even close to being cooked to order. We asked for the manager and the short version is they refired the steaks.  My chicken arrived with the new steaks.  My chicken was under cooked but at  this point it was time to give up. At the end of the night they did not even offer to adjust the bill they thought a free dessert would solve the issues without asking.  So at the end of the night and $800 later we departed.

Kids got chicken strips and fries both of which were mediocre at best. Chicken looked chemical ridden, like they picked it up from Restaurant Depot frozen section.

2015-03-03,2.0,"I came here for a work dinner with a party of ten with a 7pm reservation on a Monday night. I will start with service because that is where most of the points were lost. I hold this restaurant to high standards because it touts that it is the #1 Steak Restaurant in Chicago. Their goal should be to provide top rate fine dining service. Our server was probably one of the worst fine dining servers I have ever had. At $50+ for a piece of meat, my server should explain why their meat deserves $50+. Tell me the story. Make me feel welcome, be happy, be personable. Do something! He was the most awkward server I've had. Our server basically took our orders almost as if it was a favor to us and left. At certain points it felt as he was talking down to us. Hey server, we wouldn't have so many questions if you did your job and greeted us properly. One positive was they did not add an automatic gratuity to our check. So he did roll the dice there which I respect. The food - 40 day dry aged ribeye $58. It was large. It was not cooked as ordered. I ordered medium rare, it came out medium well. Why on earth would you overcook a fine piece of meat? Flavor was nice. To be honest, I am a filet girl but I had to try their dry aged ribeye. I appreciated it. $13 Wedge Salad. It was good but there ain't no wedge salad worth $13. The dressing was great, the bacon was yummy, but $13? No. One person at our table ordered the Cesar salad. It is made table side, so that was a nice touch...the only problem was they brought him the wrong salad so his was delayed. We were all done with ours by the time he started eating his. Sides - Our table split Mac & Cheese, black pepper fries, Brussel sprouts, and mushrooms. Mac & Cheese was fabulous.  We enjoyed the tour of the dry aging room. Very interesting. So do request that if you find yourself here. Do it after dinner as recommended. Trust me. The atmosphere of this restaurant is as another reviewer said - underwhelming.  So overall, not a good impression. This is borderline 2/3 stars but given the service I brought it down to a 2. If service was as it should've been, this review would've been 4 stars. Not fantastic. Nothing really to write home about. In a city like Chicago with so many restaurants I would not recommend this establishment.",0.9955,0.77,0.178,0.052,0.5681037649219466
2015-03-03,2.0,"My gf and I returned to David Burke's for Valentines Day; this time to try their steaks.    The Good - The bacon stick appetizer is worth the trip.  Fortunately, we saw these served at the bar as well.  Picture chunks of bacon dipped in maple syrup.  And the black pepper (maybe salish - alder smoked pepper) only added to the flavor.  I'd go back for this.  The popover was also pretty tasty. The Bad - Way too much fat on the filet and NY strip.  Not much else to say, sadly.  I appreciate a marbleized cut but both steaks should have been trimmed better.   The Ugly - I was surprised that when asked how we wanted our steaks cooked the server explained to us what rare and medium mean.  Rare - ""That's a cool red center"".  Medium - ""That's a warm pink center.""  Really?!  Why not explain that the steaks come from a cow while you're at it? Was she confirming that they know how to cook a rare and medium steak or questioning our knowledge of how steak is cooked?  Either way I find it insulting.  Maybe if we were at Outback where the customer may not be as knowledgeable about steaks this is acceptable but if I'm at DB's ordering a $64 NY strip, one would assume I would know how I like it cooked.  And if doneness is an issue, just make a note somewhere on the menu.  Maybe from now on I'll just say 140 degrees instead of medium.

2015-02-18,3.0,"This is probably the worst fine dining experience I have ever had. My girls and I were excited to dress up and enjoy a night of fine dining for restaurant week. We made reservation for 7 PM on a Tuesday and did valet parking right in front of the restaurant ($15). We got seated in a booth for four people and it was a bit awkward to talk to everyone because the person sitting on the opposite ends is too far to really talk and I kind of had to yell... Our waiter was not very social and did a poor job making us feel welcome or anything. I believe that in fine dining, an important part is the service that it provides to the customers. Nonetheless, we shrugged off the waiter and continued with our dining experience. I ordered the tomato bisque, filet, and dessert from the restaurant week menu. While waiting for our food, they brought out an interesting looking bread. It was hollow on the inside and I thought it was very cool way of displaying bread. The tomato bisque was good but I think I got sick of the rich creamy taste halfway through so I did not finish it.  Next up was the entree, which was filet mignon for me. It came out as a piece of filet on a big white plate. For me, another part of the fine dining experience is to enjoy the culinary art and see how the chef would display a ordinary piece of meat and make it look way to pretty to eat. However, this was not the case. They had separate dishes for the mashed potatoes and the grilled onion/veggie side. I was very disappointed because I'm the type of person that would enjoy taking pictures of food and it was a very lame picture to display. The filet itself was okay, I think it was a bit too salty for my personal liking. My friend got a medium well but it came out to be really red inside and she complained it to be chewy and didn't finish more than half of her filet. I guess the ""best"" part of dinner was dessert because it highlighted 3 different desserts: chocolate cake, eclair, and cake pop. They were all a bit too sweet but my favorite would have to be the eclair.

From the outside it pretty nice. I like the big bar and lounge they have as soon as you walk in. The crowd was a little older and and quiet. Dinner was a $44 package, but for around a $30 upgrade I was able to get the 75 day aged ribeye. First a toasty bun came out, it was great, had a nice smokey taste witch hints of chese, and it was nice and crispy. Next the tomatoe bisque with lump of crab. Wow that might have been one of the best soups i have ever had in my life, so flavorful, I had to resist to lick the bowl clean! Finally the star of the show the meat. The ribeye came out, medium rare like I like it. Opon first taste it deff had a different flavor. It was dry and kinda jerky tasting. Its not most like all the other steaks I had. Honestly the dryness gave it a different taste I can see people loving but its not for me. I will say that unlike most ribeyes that fat on this meat almost melts away, leaving me with almost nothing but the bone on the plate. Overall #1 steakhouse in Chicago might be a little too much for this place to handle. The place looks nice but in the end still feels like a hotel lobbyish feel. When you go to places like this and drop this much money you kinda want more then a good tasting meat on your plate, and thats were this place lacks compared to other steakhouses in Chicago.

I get it that it's restaurant week and the restaurant is probably busy, but I think restaurants should not sacrifice quality to participate in restaurant week because it will ruin the experience for customers trying to check out a new place to add to their location. I'll be back, during non restaurant week to see if things are different, but I can no longer keep the 5 star rating for now.",0.986,0.768,0.138,0.094,0.5301109548048323

One steak was not even a filet but instead a quarter inch piece of gross beef that was supposed to be cooked medium but was instead  burnt all around the outside with a rare inside. The other steak was cooked appropriately (medium rare) but had enough fat in it that I was unable to cut it.

2015-02-02,1.0,"I visited David Burke's on Friday night as part of Restaurant Week. This was my first time there so I can't say what it's like usually, but I was very disappointed in the whole experience. We went with friends who have been before and love it so we took their word for it. We had an 8:15 reservation, valet parked ($14) and went inside. It is in the lobby of the James hotel and it looks like a lobby restaurant to be honest. Even though there were empty tables and we had 4/6 people there, they would not seat us. I understand a lot of restaurants do that, but I felt like the hostesses and the coat check girl were all very snobby.  The table for 6 was cramped and had too much stuff on it for anyone to even put their small purse down or to set their menu down. Everyone sat with everyone on their lap for the most part. The server was good, I don't remember his name but there were 2 weird instances; he asked for our drink order and one of my friends ordered a bottle of wine so he wrote it down, said great and then walked away. That bottle was for her and her boyfriend, no one else wanted wine and we wanted to order other drinks. When he came back, he took everyone's drink orders except for 1 other person. Very strange. Also, he was handing out menus in order of how everyone was sitting at the table and he gave one to the person on my right and then pulled another one out so when I went to get it, he went over my head and gave it to the person on my left. Whatever. Other than that, he was decent. He was friendly, asked where we were going out after, etc.  In terms of food, this was the biggest disappointment. From the Restaurant Week pre fixe menu I got the Filet and upgraded to the Cesar salad. It came with a trio of desserts as well as mushrooms and mashed potatoes. I also ordered a side of the Broccolini ($6). The Cesar was good, but NOT worth the $10 upgrade. Apparently, if you order it usually it is made table side and presented really cool. This was just a small salad, nothing special. The filet had a ton of fat on it, which I was really unhappy with. I only ate half of it. The broccolini was really good and a good addition to our meal. Potatoes were blah and I don't eat mushrooms so I can't comment on that. The dessert was good too, it was a mini eclair, mini cheesecake and something else but I can't remember what. I will say, you start the meal off with a cheese popover (everyone gets their own, it's huge) and that with the butter & sea salt was probably the best part of the meal. My friend mentioned that since it was Restaurant Week and prices were cheaper, they were probably serving cuts of meat that weren't up to their normal standards so I don't know if that was the issue or what, but I was not the only one at the table to comment on the amount of fat on their steak.  I have eaten steaks at Mastros, Capital Grille, Chicago Cut, etc and know what a good steakhouse is. David Burke's is not that. With the pre-fixe menu, upgrades, tax and tip my bill ended up being about $75. For what we got, I was glad it wasn't more than that.

I was only informed of that the day before the reservation, and it was too late to make a reservation elsewhere since I had made it so long ago and because my friends had picked the restaurant. I spoke to a female manager on the phone and told her about this. She said that she would put a note on my reservation so that I could just order a main course. However, when talking to the waiter and asking him about that, he seemed to have not gotten the note and instead was telling us that we could only order the RW menu. Due to not wanting to make a scene in front of the restaurant, I just ordered the RW menu and ate what I could. Unfortunately, despite taking my medications before the meal, I was in pain and could not really enjoy dinner. I ate what I could and took leftovers home. All the food that I tasted was good, except for dessert. Dessert included a mini chocolate cake with frosting on the sides. It was completely bland, and I could have made one better than that. The cheesecake lollipop was the best of the desserts but also nothing special. The éclair was very disappointing and harder than it should be. I am French and I am not just saying this because I am picky with my éclairs. It was not a proper éclair and did not taste very good. My friends agreed with me about the dessert course. I would not recommend David Burke's due to my unsatisfactory experience.",-0.1681,0.869,0.061,0.07,0.5307904761904763
2015-02-01,2.0,"Came back for another run at Restaurant Week, and I have to say--major bust. First, the good.  DB was good when it came to accommodating our one-year-old, who is always great in restaurants but the staff all seemed positive when eyeing up the potential baby storm that could have erupted.  Also, I still love the space at DB and the chairs are very comfortable.  And, even though the space was pretty empty at noon on this past Saturday, we were right at the 15-minute late mark for our 12 PM reservation but the staff didn't make us wait or show any irritation at our arrival time. Now, the bad.  We came in for restaurant week, back again for this year after last year's incredible value.  But from the jump, everything was off.  As we were getting seated--literally as I was taking off my jacket, still standing behind my chair--our server assistant (water guy) asked us what kind of water we wanted, and then our main server asked us if we wanted anything to drink.  (To recap--I WAS STILL STANDING UP when this conversation happened!!!)  After I blew her off, she came back three minutes later and asked again if I wanted anything to drink.  We were still catching up with our third party member and hadn't even opened the menus yet, so we blew the server off again.  As someone that is usually managing a ticking time bomb of a child and wants to get in and out of restaurants, I was shocked how PO'ed I was that our server was trying to hustle us so hard just after sitting down.  Finally, we took the server's advice and ordered a specialty cocktail, an old-fashioned with a morning twist to it.  More on this later. We ordered from the restaurant week lunch menu ($22 for three courses), and we planned to try the wedge, burger and dessert platter just like last year.  To mix it up, I decided to try the very vanilla turkey BLT sammie instead, and my wife got the burger.  HOWEVER--we expected to get both the side mash and mushrooms plus a popover bread starter as well...but this year, those cost extra.  We decided to pay for a piece of bread anyway to ensure we filled up. The wedge was a disappointment; it was a little light on dressing, which made the large hunk of iceberg lettuce sorta plain.  The BLT was a bust--it was light on mayo (there was a special mayo used on the made-in-house turkey used in the sammie) but there was enough bacon to keep me happy.  The popover--which clearly should have been served before the mains--was brought with the sandwiches, leading to bread overkill.  And, why was the popover not hot?  It was lukewarm when we got it, leading to the continued belief that it was not brought out when it was ready. The biggest offense (when it came to the food) was the dessert platter; after waiting about 25 minutes to get this after we cleared the mains, both of the two desserts I could try (the third in the sampler had peanuts, an allergy for me) were days old, including a chocolate cake and an eclair that were bland and stale. The biggest offense overall?  When we got the bill, our bill was $135 for three restaurant week lunches (again, $22 each) and three cocktails.  Shocked, we dove into the details...the specialty cocktail was $17 each!!!! SEVENTEEN DOLLARS!!!! Friends, I drink semi-professionally and I've never paid $17 for a drink in Chicago.  That our server ""forgot"" to mention that this cocktail is $3 more than the menu prices for their cocktails (or that $17 for an old-fashioned is flat-out ridiculous) was an insult that left me as angry as I'll be in a restaurant during restaurant week, for sure.  I brought this up to a manager and she removed one of the drinks from the bill, and the explanation we got was that ""this is one of our 'cheaper' bourbons on the menu"" and that we should have known it would be more than the other drinks on the regular menu.

I didn't realize it was Restaurant Week; because of that there were some slight changes to the menu. This meant I didn't get the appetizer I was craving: the Wagyu Beef Sashimi. That's the only reason I knocked off one star.  My waiter was a lovely man named Tim who was informative and charming. When he learned it was my birthday I was brought a glass of champagne on the house which was very nice indeed!

2015-01-19,1.0,"Terrible from beginning to end. First, we had to wait on a Monday night to be seated...about 30 min...for our reservation and then we were taken to a booth after we requested a table. A high end steak joint should also know a booth does not work well for big men. When we asked about a table (maybe the open one we walked by???) we were told there were no tables available, so back to the bar we went stopping by the hostess stand....only to have the hostess (a different hostess) tell us there was a table....back to the one we were told was not available. Not an easy feat for the legally blind client of mine who was part of our party.  Of course, all nigth long we all felt like we were in the aisle to the point where we joked (but it actually happened) about the guy pushing a cart around a too crowded. too tight restaurant to make salads tableside. Basically, if it doesn't fit through the aisle, push harder on the lady's chair untill the cart does fit down the aisle.  Once we were ready to order I was informed I could not have a burger because the chef would not allow it even though it came out of the same kitchen for bar customers.  Really?!  Then, my client, who had a drink earlier at the bar ordered another at the table. He informed the waiter that he thought the speed pour might be dirty, but his drink tasted off and different from the one he had previously. The waiter seemed miffed and said he would inquire only to find out something was not right (clean???) and another drink was made to correct it.  Additionally, the whole night included quite the attitude. What an embarrassment to take a client here. I had such high hopes. I now look very differently at this namesake. Chicagoans....stick to Gibsons or other local Chicago steak houses for a decent steak and service.  Personally, not a fan of their dry aged steaks. No flavor and I feel like it tastes like a well done steak. Everyone at our table left most of the meat on the plate....all steak eating men. I should have ordered the chicken....since I was not ""allowed"" to order a burger....a great way to judge a good steak house if you are not up for a huge steak dinner.  To top off an awful evening, we ordered decaf coffee....only to be awake all night as the result of being served caffenated coffee.

2015-01-16,5.0,"So in my opinion the steakhouse was amazing.  Service, as recommended, we requested Tim. He totally took charge of the meal and made sure that everything was spaced out just perfectly. Have time between each course but not too much time. Made recommendations all over the board and was really knowledgeable and confident. It was nice not to have to really ask for anything and have everything taken care of on our special evening. Food! Everything was amazing.  The steak tartare appetizer was so fresh and flavorful. Also got a shrimp cocktail and the giant prons were so good. You could tell they were very fresh.  The tableside Caesar salad is an absolute must! Not only is it the best Cesar salad I've ever had but they make it right next to the table. Shred some aged Parmesan on afterwards that was bursting with flavor.  The dry aged steaks were killer. I had a 40 day and my husband had a 50 day, I liked mine better and he liked his better. Cooked  to perfection, juicy, and an amazing unique flavor. Exactly what I was looking for. The macaroni and cheese side. Most restaurants go totally crazy with macaroni and cheese but this was simple, savory, and most importantly light. Also a must! The mushroom side was only okay. Being a special occasion we added the 1 pound split lobster to the meal. The lobster was so sweet and succulent. Served with a butter and also a sour cream type dipping sauce. Dessert was of course the freshly made, in tin, red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting. They did this table side as well and it was just baked. Forgetting about the fact that this desert could easily serve 5 people, we had lots of leftovers that my playgroup enjoyed this morning.  Several  managers stopping by and even a private tour of the dry aging room made this evening just perfect.    Was the perfect place to splurge for special evening out.  next time will definitely go back and get the steaks, macaroni and cheese, Caesar salad, and dessert.",0.9987,0.705,0.268,0.027,0.5853403540903541

2015-01-05,3.0,"First I'd like to say this review is based solely on the New Years Eve pre-set menu. We decided to spend NYE in Chicago (my first visit), I'm from Atlanta.  All I've heard is how good Chicago steaks were and you have to check out the A-list steakhouses.  So we decided on David Burke's based on reviews, a few friend recommendations, and a glance at the menu.  My expectations were pretty high.  I'm not being a homer but I will rank the top 3 steakhouses (Kevin Rathbun's, Bones, and Chops Lobster Bar) in GA against any in the country so my expectations were probably higher than usual for a Chicago Steakhouse.  Anyway, back to my review of David Burke's.   Scale of 1-5: Location - 3 - The restaurant was inside the James Hotel.  The ambience was a little weird to be honest.  For a high end restaurant everything just came off as plain.  It wasn't romantic, nor did it feel like a place for a power dinner for business people.  It was just very average. Service - 5 - Excellent service, our waiter and assisting staff was on point.  No complaints here.  What you would expect from a high end steakhouse. Food - 3 - Here is where my major gripes are.....I absolutely hate pre-set menus, and I don't understand why a high end steakhouse would do this.  There were things we wanted to try on the regular menu but could not because it wasn't on the preset menu.  And then there were surcharges added to any dry aged steak you ordered.  So not only do I have to select from limited appetizers I wouldn't have got but now I'm paying extra for dry aged steak (in my case extra $40 for the 75 day).  If we'd known there was a pre-set menu we would have went elsewhere.  The appetizers were just ok, we had the wagyu beef shashimi, and surf and turf dumplings.  The wagyu was great, but the surf and turf dumplings you can tell were pre-made (came out cold).  My girlfriend got the filet, and it was great, I got the 75 day dry aged ribeye.....just ok.  No choice in sides, you automatically got mashed potatoes and mushrooms....again no choice.   Price - 5 - Meal, Bottle of wine, and tip it came out to $355.  For 2 people. This was based solely on the pre-set menu.  I would like to maybe check this place out again when I have the entire menu available but it will be awhile.  There are plenty of other high end steak houses to try first.  Overall my first experience was disappointing.",0.9314,0.836,0.095,0.069,0.5111417055167053

From my greeting at the door to a great martini at the bar to the lack of pressure to be seated to the professional but not pusher server Chris, simply flawless. We started with a lovely amuse of cucumber and crab, next perfectly shucked and fresh raw oysters, steak tartar, Wagu carpaccio, a crisp warm yorkshire pudding and the unreal bacon!!! All of the highest quality and executed perfectly! Then the best table side Caesar with white anchovy and chili oil that I have ever had. Then a pallet cleanser of a lime, orange sorbet I think. Awesome!  Great wine list too and excellent wine service, decanting, proper clean stemware ect. I got the 40 day dry aged ribeye, the best steak I have ever eaten. Again I am a steak aficionado. my family owns two steak houses in PA. I dont say this lightly. We had great sauteed mushrooms, brocolini , and amazing mac and cheese. We shared a few delightfully refreshing sorbets. The manager Tommy gave us a tour of the magic dry aging room at the end of the meal as well. The whole staff made us feel special.

I've now had both the 40- and 55-day bone-in ribeyes and they are fantastic.  Get them rare to rare+ and the flavors will blow you away.  The 55-day definitely had more intense flavor, but both were so good.  The fat literally melts away in your mouth.  I'd be hard-pressed to tell you where to get a better steak.  I love the Ruth's Chris Cowboy Ribeye, but these are arguably better and you get to select the level of aging.   My girlfriend has now had the regular filet and bone-in filet and prefered the regular one.  Again, get either of them rare.  Incredible flavors, a bit more salty than the ribeyes, but not in a bad way; just different.  You can't go wrong.   As for the sides, good luck finding better mac 'n cheese because their kind is just wonderful.  Also try the mushrooms; they go great with the steaks.  And don't forget the tableside Caesar salad:  It's a must!  (Tip the person who makes it.) Their cocktail, beer, and wine menu is extensive.  At our first visit, they were offering Duck Horn cab at $128/bottle as opposed to the regular price of $180.  If they run that special again, take advantage of it because that wine pairs perfectly with the steaks.  As for pre-dinner drinks, I highly recommend the ""Petite Confit"" and ""Breakfast In Bed,"" the latter of which is bourbon-based and comes with a slice of bacon in it.  Both were outstanding and perfect winter drinks.  If you're confused, ask for guidance, and your waiter will gladly assist.   Any of the desserts are winners.  And by all means, make sure you have their coffee!  I know I sound like a Primehouse fanboy, but even their damn coffee is the best I've ever had.  Truly!  Bottom line:  You can't go wrong at Primehouse.  Yes, it's a bit pricey, but you genuinely get what you pay for.  Nice ambiance, outstanding food and drinks, and excellent service.  Get there!  And ask for Tim K.!",0.9993,0.708,0.272,0.019,0.6228093738620054

2014-11-30,5.0,"One of my best restaurant experiences ever. My wife, two young kids, father-in-law, and myself came here for the four-course Thanksgiving day meal. We sat in a very comfortable booth, and as soon as we sat there was an army of people attending to our every need. The service was honestly fantastic (Jamie was our waitress, but the whole staff had a great flow). My wife upgraded to the classic filet, and I upgraded to the 40 day dry-aged bone-in ribeye. Both medium rare, both cooked to perfection. My ribeye was extremely high quality, juicy, and great tasting. I'd say it was in the top 5 steaks I've ever had. Since I was already kind of full by the time my steak arrived from all of the family style sides and the previous courses, I only ate about half of my steak and wanted to bring the rest home to eat the next day. My wife did the same. The waitress packed everything up and said that she threw in some turkey sandwiches and snicker doodle cookies as well. The next day my wife and I were looking forward to eating our leftovers all day. Later that evening I pulled everything out of the refrigerator and noticed that everything was there EXCEPT THE STEAKS!! My heart sank, and I might have even shed a tear. It was a dark moment in my life. Only a steak that delicious could impact me that much! My wife got on the phone and called them up telling them the situation. The person said that a manager would call us back shortly. The manager, Tommy, called back about 15 minutes later and asked what kind of steaks we had. My wife told him, expecting some kind of argument about whether or not they forgot to put the steaks in, or if we lost them. So many people are quick to point fingers. Nope, no argument, no accusations, no negativity. Tommy said ok, I'm going to make you two NEW STEAKS and drive them out to your house right now!!! I was, and still am, in total shock that he did this. We don't even live in the loop or anything either. Our steaks arrived about 45 minutes later and he even threw in some basil mashed potatoes with the order just because he wanted us to have a fresh side to eat with our steaks. I am completely impressed with the restaurant, the service, the professionalism, the food, and especially how they treated us as customers. It is very rare that a restaurant can get great food and great service to come together as good as David Burke's. Highly recommended.",0.989,0.813,0.128,0.06,0.5238099943534725
2014-11-28,2.0,"Very disappointing. As a former New Yorker, I'm well aware of the caliber of David Burke's restaurants. If his name wasn't on this one, I never would have known. All details were lost. Host Stand was a bit clueless as they couldn't remember the names of any parties checking in, never once asked to check our coats--even after moving us out of the way several times to retrieve others' coats, etc. We waited 20 minutes our so for our reservation--no big deal--expected on a busy holiday.  But details were lost throughout. The mats on the floors were unkempt, the bathrooms were a mess, the entire restaurant just looked old and uncared for. Even the pepper grinder they brought to the table looked warn out and overused. The waiter was friendly but not all that attentive. We had a gluten free person in our party--also noted in our reservation-- and were left with--""well you can't have this, and you can't have that,"" and then didn't even make an effort to supply a gluten free side or two part of the thanksgiving prefix the accommodate. I mean there were green beans on the menu with mushroom gravy. They couldn't just steam or sauté up some plain green beans?!  The decor was very dated. The service was clunky. Bussers would pour water and miss our glasses.  An extra setting was left at our table past the first course.  Clearing was messy and intrusive and loud--dishware and silverware clanking loudly with no finesse. The runners didn't even take time to know what they were delivering but instead had to read a chit each time as the dropped a dish off.  Food was fine but not memorable, and definitely not David Burke quality. The miniscule amount of cranberry compote was barely enough to feed one person--but however ended up being plenty as it was overpowered with the flavor or orange and spices and not enjoyable. The Mac and cheese was right out of Boston market. The desserts were very ""mass produced"" feeling, having been popped out of molds for fast and easy plating. The creme brûlée was simply tiny custards molded beforehand and over cooked due to the technique. Not true creme Brule. And when you're paying $60 a head for a straightforward turkey dinner, things should be spot on. After a couple of cocktails, tax, and tip, we were at nearly $100 a person--way overpriced and way underdelivered.  They sent us home with leftover turkey sandwiches. A nice gesture, but you can find better at jimmy johns. Dry turkey about 3 pieces of stuffing, and mediocre bread. Wen ended up throwing them out. Luckily the company of family was good cause the rest of the experience was not. I guess this is what happens when celebrity chefs expand with no oversight. We will not be returning. There are just way too many amazing restaurants out there--even among the few only open on thanksgiving--to justify a return at this price point that don't fall short on just about every level.",0.9841,0.852,0.097,0.05,0.4874019730269731

2014-10-16,4.0,"The night started with all the makings of an unpleasant evening but ended with an experience that made me a fan of this highly rated steakhouse. It has been my experience in dining at up-scale restaurants that when a reservation is made (and confirmed that day) for 8:30 pm, when you arrive on time you are not expected to wait an additional 30 minutes to be seated; well, that's what happened to my wife & I and it didn't sit too well with us.  I actually saw a couple who came in with no reservations get seated before us; I really began to steam after that happened.  We almost walked out but I'm glad that we did not. Eventually we got seated in a nice booth right next to the Burke Private Dining Room.  Our server Corey D came to us with a positive energy, it began to wash away our initial negative experience.   The first item brought to our table was the popovers.  These light crusted breads were a delightfully tender on the inside; we had a 2nd serving brought over immediately and we usually never eat extra bread. The 2nd course was the Wagyu Beef Sashimi.  It wasn't served on a brick of Himalayan sea salt like I had seen in other photos but was presented nicely nonetheless.  The strands of fat were visible and plentiful on each micro-slice.  The salt flavor was present on the outer edges of the very tender beef.  The truffle mayo and mushroom chips added their own flavor to the beef but should be used sparingly to appreciate the Wagyu better. For the main course, I had the 55-day aged ribeye prepared medium rare while my wife chose the 28-day ribeye prepared medium.   My steak came out perfectly pink and well rested; there was not an abundant of juices on my plate.  The crust was a pleasant dark brown with the right amount of salt tasted on each bite.  What I appreciate about the steak is that it was not covered in butter like other chophouses.  You get the meat in all it's glory without any added fat to put faux juice into the steak.  The execution and preparation of the steak was Class A. I have never had a 55-day aged ribeye but I must say I couldn't tell much of a difference as I had a portion of my wife's 28 day ribeye.  This is unfortunate because I was extremely excited to experience a steak that has gone through such a time consuming preparation.  Perhaps my taste palette is not as a tune to appreciate the process of what the meat goes through.  This is not to take away the effort of the staff or chefs behind the scenes.  I am sure, they make sure each dish that leaves the kitchen is done with pride and profession that David Burke himself would want. Overall my experience is one of positive notes.  I would have given a 5-star rating if my start of the dinner wasn't delayed 30 minutes after my confirmed reservation time.  The flavors of each dish were on point and execution of the steak was perfect.  Corey D and the crew provided excellent service making sure our glasses were filled and table was cleared.  The only drawback was mine alone as my taste buds could not understand the difference between a 55 day and 28 day ribeye steak.  David Burke is a wonderful chophouse and would be better if they honor your reservation time.",0.9988,0.784,0.191,0.025,0.5727284752284751

Let me start from the beginning.  Started the evening with cocktails, I forget what my wife ordered, but I started with my barometer for any self-respecting bar: the Tom Collins.  They nailed it - perfect balance between sweet and sour with a nice punch.  As an aside, huge squares of pink Himalayan salt hanging all over the restaurant is a really nice touch. I'm going to speed past our appetizer (crab cake) and our cuts of beef.  Other reviewers have done a great job singing their praises, and I agree with those who have used the most complementary superlatives. I'd actually like to spend the rest of my time to credit Primehouse for being at the forefront of new technology in relation to its wine list.  They have embraced the use of the Coravin, a device that allows you to extract wine from a bottle without removing the cork.  The main benefit is that you can taste old bottles, or monitor a wine's aging without interrupting the aging process.  We took advantage of this incredible opportunity and enjoyed glasses of a 2002 Andrew Will, 1975 Croizet-Bages, 1966 Kirwan, 1971 and 1975(?) d'Yquem side-by-side.  An incredible experience tasting aged wine at peak drinking stages.  Well worth the additional cost.",0.9964,0.75,0.231,0.019,0.5337774294670846

The highlights of the meal were the mushrooms side and the fill-your-own donut holes dessert. Both were delicious and, in the case of the donuts, rather fun. The ambience left something to be desired. The decor feels like a hotel lobby (which it more or less is). The chandeliers were disheveled and had bulbs out. The table coverings were textured rubber, and they needed to be cleaned -- you could see black muck in the crevices of the texturing.  I'm being somewhat nitpicky here -- the overall dining experience was fine. But when I'm paying $100+ per person, it needs to exceed ""fine.""

While planning our Chicago trip, the bf was all ""David Burke this"" and ""David Burke that.""  Apparently, it's one of the best steakhouses in the country.  Oh okay, whatevs.  Little did I know what kind of an experience I was in for. First, I thought I had booked resies for 8:30pm because that's what my Google calendar was showing me while we were ""wasting time"" up in the John Hancock building.  But then I realized that my Open Table was telling me I had a resie there at that moment!  Stupid Google for automatically changing my time two hours ahead (I added it to my calendar on the West Coast for 6:30pm and when I flew across time zones, Google automatically adjusted for Mid-west time).  No worries though because David Burke was more than happy to change my resies for 8:30pm even though it was already 6:40pm. When we got there at 8:30, it was quiet and we noticed not many people were there (Sunday evening).  Which was perfect for us because we got all the attention.  We both ordered the 55 day aged rib-eye and, for the first time ever, RARE.  For sides, we ordered the mac and cheese, ricotta gnudi, and some carrots with goat cheese.  The mac and cheese was meh, kind of dry, but the gnudi was little soft creamy pillows of awesomeness.  As for the carrots, the bf was a big fan of but not for me.   Now, for the main event.  The steak was perfectly done.  I had never gone rare before and was a little scared but the waiter convinced me that it was the way to go for aged steaks.  He was right.  The steak burst with flavor with a deep red center.  I finished the whole thing.  Never come between me and a steak this perfect. At the end of our meal, the manager came by and took us on a tour of their steak room (at the request of the bf).  It was fascinating to see how they age their steaks and the amount of salt in that big freezer.  A bit smelly but a good experience to have. Overall, great food and great service.  A great way to end our Chicago trip.",0.9939,0.841,0.131,0.028,0.5236353077816494

I can't remember for the life of me what steak I got, but my date got a dry-aged steak. He loved it. I had a bite but it didn't make much of an impression on me. But to this day, he raves about it, and considering he ate most of it, I trust that it was good. The cocktails were awesome and the waitstaff so great. I was just impressed. I came back one day for lunch. I remembered that there was this bread they served at dinner and asked if I could have some. The waiter politely told me that they didn't serve it at lunch but since my sister was ordering a steak (ahem, $50 or so dollars), he'd see if he could ask the chef to whip something up.

My eggs benedict came exactly as ordered, and the waiter apologized for the wait and said they had neglected to leave the sauce on the side the first time so he had asked them to make it again. The eggs were cooked perfectly with runny yolks but no runny whites, the smoked salmon was extremely high quality and generous in its portion, and the hollandaise was served in a lovely silver gravy boat on the side. It was slightly too lemony for my taste but the entire dish was still very good. The roast potatoes in a small cast iron skillet were utter perfection, crispy outside and fluffy inside. The waiter kindly offered salt and pepper and brought me a clever grinder that dispensed both pink himalayan sea salt and fresh ground pepper.  I believe this dish was around $12, which is very fair given the portion and quality of the ingredients.

I give a poor review when panera bread is out of bread or Starbucks is out of skim milk and the same is true when a steakhouse is out of its best steak. Ignoring that, the waitress was friendly. They cooked one of our filets well when it was asked as medium, but it was corrected immediately without question and the rest of the experience was pleasurable.

I'm working in California this summer so naturally I showed up in jeans and flip flops but luckily the restaurant didn't turn me away :) The ambiance of this place is probably my least favorite of the nice steakhouses I have been to. It's just not my style - it doesn't feel luxurious enough for the price tag. On the bright side, the food was very good. We got the fliet mignon (the less expensive version) and my hubby says it's one of the best steaks he has ever had.  The mashed potatoes were delicious and we added crab legs as an accompaniment and they were huge! Really the only thing I didn't like about the food was that it got cold rather quickly. By the middle of the meal my food was pretty cold. I don't know why this steak ended up colder than steaks I've had in the past or how the restaurant can fix something like that. The Chocolate Financier was not as delicious or decadent as it could have been. I wouldn't recommend it. With a couple of their cheaper glasses of wine, filet mignon, crab legs, and mashed potatoes, and dessert, our bill with tax and tip came to $154.

2014-09-03,4.0,"How do you judge the excellence of a steakhouse? Quality of the meat, certainly. The sides matter, of course. But in some cases, more than the food sets one place above another - ambience, wine pairings and service. That's where David Burke's Primehouse, located in The James Hotel at 616 N. Rush St. , stands out. If all the wait staff are as knowledgeable and attentive as was Bryan, our server on a recent visit, this place gets nearly five stars. Plus the wines they paired with our food were truly exceptional. The first one, for example, was a blend of their own vintages that rated a solid four stars. Primehouse occasionally offers a prix fixe menu with wine pairings at an attractive price compared to ordering a la carte. Once you review the regular menu and look at what you would have been paying, you realize just how attractive the package is. At any rate, the Primehouse folks select the menu to showcase some of their most popular items. The appetizer, Surf & Turf Dumplings, takes the prize for imaginative use of ordinary ingredients. Two little dumplings - really, deep-fried dough-covered-fillings-on-a-stick - come out beautifully displayed on a pair of square pristine-white plates - set off brilliantly by the restaurant's subtle mood lighting. And then comes the taste. Layer upon layer of flavor jumps out as you bite into each dumpling - one made with lobster and roasted lemon chutney, and the other with meltingly tender beef short rib meat seasoned with pickled red onion and spicy mustard. The dish was reminiscent of the finely wrought, multi-layered-flavors in certain Asian delicacies but with a distinctly North American weight to it. Next came an arugula salad full of almost-bacony flavor from the house-smoked-over-applewood truffle tomatoes, set off with pine nuts and coated lightly with a creamy goat cheese fondue. Nice combo. Especially enjoyed the slight bitterness of the greens with the creamy smoothness of the dressing. We were taken aback when Bryan delivered the next plate. Three very large chunks of seared, rare ahi tuna sat atop a vegetable mix consisting of preserved fennel, bell peppers, black olives and a few green beans. A more than generous serving of an intriguing combination, though not a favorite for either of us. Next, the piece de resistance. The auxiliary server arrived with a large char-grilled steak. Bryan was concerned that it might be overdone (we'd requested one serving medium rare and one medium well). We appreciated that he asked to have it taken back so the chef could confirm it was properly cooked to order. While we waited, Bryan explained this is their most popular steak - the bone-in 55-day dry-aged ribeye, and that it hangs in their own dry-aging smokehouse for that many days before it's sent to the grill. The steak came back from the kitchen confirmed, and the auxiliary server carved it for us, first in half, and then in slices, giving each of us pieces that conformed to our wished-for doneness. Sides included an aluminum basket of French Fries seasoned with truffle oil and melted Asiago cheese, and a generous helping of Roasted Mushrooms seasoned with shallots, sherry vinegar and herbs and served in a sizzling oval skillet.  While none of these dishes reached beyond good, they were nicely prepared and flavorful. Throughout the meal both Bryan and the sommelier kept us in generous tastes of the selected paired fine wines. Bryan was also kind enough to write out the list of wines for us: Palette Pinot Noir 2013 (Primehouse's own blend for sale by request at $75/bottle) - exceptional William Fevre Chablis 2012 - a beautifully balanced, un-oaky Chardonnay Sanford Chardonnay 2013 - Santa Barbara Duckhorn Cabernet Sauvignon 2012 - Napa Valley - exceptional Finally, a composed dessert called Coconut & Mango. Coconut cake, mango semifreddo (softly frozen custard), mango mojito sorbet, and key lime chia seed gelee.

The waiter warned us to eat the sashimi quickly, otherwise it would become too salty. For the steak, we took a risk and tried 75-day bone-in ribeye. It had a intense dry aged flavor. Since we really liked the dry aged steak at Peter Luger, this was nothing unfamiliar. I actually liked it better than Peter Luger's 28-day porterhouse, which was more tender.

The interior was nothing spectacular, not unlike any large chain hotel restaurant, with an unremarkable, neutral palette. It took too long to get our wines by the glass. And then, our food arrived too soon after we ordered. They need to get their timing down. The only reason I might give this two stars is that we had a good server.

I ordered the lobster bisque as an appetizer. There were actual chunks of lobster. It was so good I think I ate it in about 2 minutes. My entree was a filet mignon. It was cooked perfectly and had a side of potatoes, that were so good. Just thinking about my meal now, makes my mouth water. I finished off this meal with a creme brulee to die for.

By menu item:  - oysters, I had a selection of four and there were well-presented and fresh  - wagyu ""sashimi"" carpaccio: excellent, and i liked the idea of a salt block platter but it did over-season the beef  - 55-day Ribeye: if you had blindfolded me, I would never have guessed from texture, tenderness and much of the flavor that this was that special of a steak.  The fat was rich, but I don't think the seasoning was well balanced through the steak (surprising).  Some bites from the center were excellent, but those near the edges were less so.  The steak was on the done side of medium rare and that probably did not help.  This would have been a four-star steak at half the price, but all considered we are in two-star territory here.  - Roasted potatoes: fine, nothing special - Manhattan: perfect Service was very good, no complaints there. So this ended up being a very nice ""entertrain a client with an expense account"" type of  dinner, but disappointing if you wanted a top-notch steak.",0.9728,0.745,0.177,0.079,0.632590476190476

2014-08-02,1.0,"There are several ways to review an establishment like David Burke's: food, service, ambiance. Unfortunately, David Burke's was one of the worst dining experiences my partner and I have had at a high tier establishment in all of these categories.  Food: We ordered the tuna tartar,  45 day ribeye, and three sides consisting of mac & cheese, creamed spinach, and mashed potatoes. The tuna was clearly of high quality, but the preparation clearly missed the mark. Instead of focusing on flavors that would compliment the tuna and bring out its natural flavor, such as lemon, the soy sauce and chili masked what we were trying to consume.  However, the steak was the real disappointment. Having eaten at many great steakhouses, such as Peter Lugar, BLT Prime, and Keens, and a regular home steak cook, I have a pretty good idea about what my dry aged 60+ dollar steak should taste like. I was hesitant and held down my expectations, but I truly expected more of of an establishment routinely winning awards for making the best steak in Chicago. Beyond being flavorless, it was chewy! My partner eventually had to give up trying to eat it because of how chewy or was. How this happens with a dry aged prime steak is beyond me. I've had better steak at Outback!  The sides are mediocre at best. The spinach was overpowered by the creme, and the mac and cheese, while having excellent texture, tasted fairly bland.  The only start of the meal was the mashed potatoes. These contended with the best I've ever had. Still, they should not have been the start of this meal. We ultimately decided to skip desert and get it at a different restaurant to avoid further disappointment.  Service: the wait staff here was terrible considering the price range. Beyond several being dressed informally, they showed an active indifference to our experience, appearing like they didn't want to be there. Not the experience we expected on a romantic night out, or if I were bringing a client here.  Ambiance: I never have high expectations here for steakhouses, but theirs was a particularly pathetic attempt. I would sum up the experience as how you would feel going into one of the renovated motel chains that have recently taken up a more modern look: at first glance it looked fine, especially when I had browsed photos, but up close it felt sterilized and cheap.  Having not eaten at other steakhouses in Chicago, I regrettably can't offer an alternative, except making your own. But for the price range, the options for a better dining experience in the city other than steak shouldn't be hard to find.",0.9954,0.753,0.174,0.073,0.564397752453308

NO!  It took several minutes for someone to acknowledge us after we were seated (we even went through the trouble of making a reservation!).  Once we were finally given the esteemed privilege to order something and the appetizer arrived, we were able to experience the first true disappointment of the day!  We each ordered crab cakes since we had been preparing all day for this and were quite hungry.  Now, I'm pretty open to someone's interpretation of what a crab cake is but this was not exactly what we were expecting... The crab meat was tucked into some kind of kaiser roll with sesame seeds with what appeared to be pretzel sticks on the bottom and top.  So this would be fine and dandy, but I found this concoction to be really salty and didn't enjoy the change of texture provided by the pretzel sticks.  But on a positive note, one of us actually liked it so this wasn't a complete loss yet!   So, out comes the entrees ( 2 55-day aged ribeyes and 1 40-day aged ribeye) along with the three sides we ordered (garlic mashed potatoes, creamy spinach, and mac n cheese).  My steak was pretty lacking in the taste department (maybe this has to do with the dry aging process), was tough, and wasn't cooked at medium all the way through ( the meat around the bone was essentially raw and virtually inedible to me)...

Our friends were there early and sat in the lounge area right by the window (outside the restaurant) and ordered some tuna tartare, a martini and a glass of Sangiovese. They loved everything...I tasted the martini and they did an excellent job. Very classy lounge area and comfy seats.  We got our seats about 10 minutes late but we were in no rush so really no points lost there. They gave us the option of a booth and we took it. Our waiter (Nathan) was awesome! Very patient with the fact that we hadn't seen our friends in a year and took our time with the menu.  We ordered a bottle of cabernet Sauvignon 2010 monument ridge for $99 which was out of this world delicious.  Each of us received a cheese popover (free) which came in an individual tin. Very nice and warm. We then ordered the Caesar salad ($14) made table side which is worth the experience! My friend and I asked if we could split it and they made us each a half order as opposed to us having to split it ourselves. Nice touch!  Now for the main meal...the guys both ordered the 55 day ribeye ($68). It was lacking the gamey flavour promised by Nathan. Tenderness was above average but not as good as some of the other too steaks they have had. Cooked well, but mainly lacking that ""melt in your mouth"" feeling.  I read the reviews on the burger and was excited to try it but it wasn't on the dinner menu! ""No problem"" says Nathan, he got them to make one...so worth it! For $12 I got a 40 day aged chuck with crispy shallots, spinach and mayo with asiago truffle fries as my side. My only mistake was I forgot to ask for cheese. I love cheese on my burger...darn! Fantastic burger! And I am a bit of a burger snob...The truffle asiago fries were great too and no extra charge on that. What a great deal! Jill loved her lamb chops ($39). I tried a piece and would concur. Delicious!  No room for dessert but we ordered a couple of Sauternes (1oz was $14) and a glass of Chardonnay after dinner.

First off, I had the 55 day dry-aged rib eye, which was a very nice steak, cooked to specified temperature and full of flavor with an occasional corner that tasted overbearingly strong and possibly with a tick too much salt seasoning overall. Was it the best steak in Chicago? Likely not as I had the best rib eye of my life in another place some time ago, albeit also in Chicago. The server explained to us how they had experimented with aging the meat quite a bit longer - to no less than 365 days - something that cannot currently be found on the menu. But apparently, at that age the meat no longer tastes like beef at all but more like a prosciutto with pungent if not rancid notes around the rim. He recommended such a steak for a party of no less than 8 people, so everyone could have a bite. He reported people consuming the whole steak who commented that ""it was good, but they would not order it again."" I found this to be a quite interesting illustration of how aging longer is not necessarily better...but just different.

2014-04-26,4.0,"David Burke's was stop #3 on my burger crawl and probably the one I was most excited to try. We came during their bar's 2 year celebration which meant cheap burgers!  We sat at the bar and ordered a few beers. Our bartender was quick, even though they were pretty busy yet he was still personable. My husband completely butchered the name of the beer and instead of laughing or correcting him, he just grabbed the right one and said ""This is what you meant, right?"" As a person that normally feels out of place at nice restaurants, I appreciated this. The chorizo mac and cheese was insanely good. I'm not really a huge fan of chorizo normally, but I found myself jamming as much of it as I could in my mouth at a steady speed. I almost wish that we got one burger to split and the mac and cheese, because we ended up so full halfway through the burgers.  Now on to the burger. The meat itself is hands down the best burger that I've ever tasted. It was so juicy and was cooked to absolute perfection. You could tell a lot of time and preparation had gone into finding the perfect combination. As good as the meat was, I felt that the toppings detracted from it. As excited as I was to try ""bacon mayo"" I found that it probably would have been better with it on the side. The spinach got all wilted from the greasiness of the burger and made it hard to bite through and finagle in my mouth. The one topping I can put my seal of approval on is the crispy shallots. So good! It was all served on a potato bun which was equally as good as the meat. I can't deny the fact that this is a divine burger that's still on my mind a few weeks later.

2014-04-18,4.0,"This place is awesome. I like it for the following reasons: 1. Dry-aged steak... It has a different taste from your standard steak. Kind of almondy. It was delicious and a whole different, very welcomed experience. 2. Bacon lollipops. Seriously, no more needs to be said.  3. Decor. It has a modern vibe to it but not overly so. I really like the space and the atmosphere.  The only kinda 'ehhh' part of our dining experience was the ordering of the red velvet cake. It takes 45 minutes or something to prepare so I placed the order with the host when we first came in. The reason I told the host is because we were celebrating a birthday and I didn't want to spoil the surprise. She assured me it would be taken care of.... it never was... post dinner time came and no cake dammit!!!! The manager came up to us and offered us drinks to make up for the mix-up.

2014-04-18,3.0,"During a recent trip to Chicago, I was eagerly awaiting my opportunity to dine at David Burke's Primehouse.  It came highlly receommended, so I booked a reservation for a party of 12, so I could take my sales team there for our regional business dinner.  When I arrived, I was surprised this restaurant did not have the typical old school elegance I imagined steak houses in Chicago would have.  Although I felt the atmosphere lacked elegance, the decor was modern and the waiters were young, hip and extremely friendly and attentive. I actually ended up dining at David Burke's twice in 4 days.  The first visit, where I hosted a party of 12 with my company sales team, we ordered caesar and wedge salads that were both prepared nicely and were wonderful starters.  I decided to order the 40 day aged rib-eye as my entree and our group decided to share the mac & cheese, asparagus, truffle asiago fries and bourbon glazed mushrooms as sides.  All were tasty except the mac & cheese which had a loaded jalapeno taste and the asparagus that was just ""meh"".  When my 40 day aged ribe-eye arrived, it was dry and cooked more towards ""medium"" verses the ""medium rare"" that I ordered.  One of my sales reps decided to return his bone-in filet since the outside of his steak was badly charred and done as ""medium well"" verses the ""medium rare"" he ordered.  Originally, I almost ordered the 35 day  Kansas City Strip.  Since another one of my sales reps ordered it, I snuck a piece of his.  It was a perfect medium rare and absolutely delicious.  What a disappointment, realizing I made the wrong decision on the steak I ordered.  But then again, I really never had an overly dry rib-eye when dining at a reputable steak house. The one luscious bite I had of the Kansas City Strip was apparently unforgettable and good enough for me to give this restaurant another try.  4 nights later, when my boyfriend joined me in Chicago (my fellow steak enthusiast), we decided to dine at David Burke's along with another friend.  We started with the caesar and arugula salads.  We then each ordered the 35 day Kansas City Strip, medium rare and shared the green beans, carmelized carrots and basil whipped potato as our sides (all excellent).  Our steaks were tasty, flavorful and done at a perfect medium rare.  The Kansas City Strip is definitely one of the best choices on the menu.  It was when I ordered it on my second visit, did I finally experience and understand all the hoopla, fervor and obsession beef enthusiasts have towards dry aged steaks.  One cool thing I forgot to mention from my first visit to David Burke's Primehouse was that after dinner, we were able to tour and view the restaurant's dry aging room.  It's quite interesting, especially if you haven't seen anything like that before.",0.9944,0.835,0.137,0.028,0.6011666666666666

2014-04-15,1.0,"I was really excited to go here for my girlfriend's birthday dinner.  Due to some issues out of our control, we had to reschedule to a next-day lunch.  I can't decide if I'm glad we did because I didn't waste more money, or if I'm mad that I did because, save for the manager, Iris, they really had the B-squad on for the Sunday day shift. The food was below mediocre, but, honestly, I can deal with that if the service is cool.  It was not. I have been in the service industry for eight years, so I'm simultaneously extra critical and extra patient when it comes to service.  I think I've complained about service once in my life before this trip.  What I experienced for a restaurant of the ""caliber"" of David Burke's was inexcusable. First of all, the place was dead.  I counted maybe six tables between two servers, so at this point I'm expecting the service to be relatively attentive . It took a pretty long time for us to be greeted.  Again, I'm usually pretty patient with this stuff and there's plenty of time after this to redeem yourself, so I wasn't too upset at this point. When the server finally came over and told us about specials, etc, it was another long wait until we saw him again. He returned and we put in for the surf and turf dumplings, which, again, sort of tasted like they were pulled out of the frozen food section from the Jewel around the corner.  Not impressed, but, hey, you can't win 'em all.  Plus, we figured the main course would make up for the lackluster appetizers. Our apps arrived before our drinks (a Coke and Diet Coke) which were forgotten numerous times.  Again, I don't mind if you forget something, but at least cop to it.  Don't keep telling me ""they're coming."" We finally got around to ordering our entrees (a while after we finished our appetizers due to a lack of attention) and we decided upon (and were super pumped about) the Steak Diane Stuffed Baked Potato.   We were pumped about these to the point that we both ordered one.  Beef tenderloin tips, mushrooms, mustard, and a brandy cream sauce IN  a baked potato at one of the best steakhouses in Chicago?  Heck. Yes. I asked for my tips to come out medium rare when I ordered and my girlfriend asked for medium.  I figured, this is a steakhouse, medium rare beef tenderloin tips are delicious. this should be a no-brainer. Apparently it was a brainer. My tips came out well done.  Now, again, a kitchen goofs up once in a while and that's OK.  My problem, however, again was with the service. I put my full plate WAY off to the side in order to get the server's attention.  He found time to walk by our table numerous times, pick up his money from the one or two other tables he had, and chat with his coworker.  Yet he never came to check in on our meal.  My girlfriend's meat also came out well done, but she ate hers anyway since she was starving.  She was about 3/4 done with her plate before I had to, on my own, get up and ask for a manager at the host stand and fill her in on my situation. As it turned out, the manager was the woman standing at the host stand.  She came over and took my meal back to the kitchen and said they were cooking a new one.  I politely told her that wasn't necessary as we had to go. She then relayed to me a message from the kitchen that, ""beef tenderloin tips are too small to cook to a temperature.""  I'm not going to shoot the messenger, and I'm no professional chef, but I have to call BS on this one.   First of all, to their credit, the tips weren't that small.  they were a nice size.  Secondly, yes, you can cook beef tenderloin tips to a temperature. I work in a restaurant where we consistently serve beef tenderloin tips (smaller than these were) to a medium rare and it's our most popular menu item.  I asked some chef friends about this experience and they also called BS, unless they were possibly using pre-cooked meat and just warmed it up. How can you work at the ""#1 Steakhouse in Chicago"" and not have the ability to cook beef to medium rare? Ridiculous. Unless you are in fact using pre-cooked beef - which would be even more disappointing. Anyway, Iris, the manager ended up comping both of our potatoes.  I appreciated that.  What I appreciated even more was that when our server dropped off the check, he actually apologized for his poor service and our negative experience.  I don't know if he was required to apologize, or if he did it on his own, but either way, I really appreciated the action.  My mind was blown and that, plus Iris, are what got this place a star at all.

2014-04-14,4.0,"When we think of a ""steakhouse"", we often have traditional images in mind: a certain air of formality and old worldliness, dark woods, leather booths, ties and jackets, etc. So this bright modern place was not what I was expecting. You also don't expect a steakhouse to handle lunch and breakfast, but apparently this place does a fine job of it. Here, they spare the formality but still bring on the brioche. We went for the steak at dinner and it was terrific--we had perfectly cooked bone-in Kansas City strips. A bit pricey? That's expected, too. You also expect good service, and I can say that ours was exceptional--cheerful, attentive, and knowledgeable. The family-style sides were perfectly cooked. For dessert we indulged in some hot, tasty doughnut holes that came with three little squeeze bottles of sauce (vanilla, ginger spice, salted caramel) for doing your own glazing, injecting, or snorting. After surveying the wine list online, we brought our own bottles, and paid corkage fees of $40 for the first and $20 for the second (ouch, but Mastro's charges $35 per, so remember to bring friends). Part of their approach is to have many wines priced in a reasonable range ($40-80). I think that's great, but at the same time, the list is limited and still reflect a 400% markup. Personally, I hate the idea of paying $80 for a $20 bottle of value wine. They pair with the food type, but sometimes they don't do justice to the caliber of the cuisine or the quality of the evening. More nice places I visit are adopting low markups on excellent wines (just $5-$10 over retail) to encourage people to add a better quality bottle for a ""total food experience"", and to make regulars of  customers without an expense account--a great idea if you ask me.",0.9913,0.796,0.156,0.048,0.6022693452380953

To be fair, we did pretty much go all out. We started with a round of beers and ordered one of the cheapest bottles of wine on the menu. We got two appetizers (surf and turf dumplings and sashimi wagyu beef) and the table side salad. Both appetizers were to die for. The sashimi wagyu beef melted in your mouth and I can't even describe the dumplings they were so good. We were a little skeptical about the salad, because really, how can a caesar salad be that good? But boy, we were surprised. We ordered the caesar salad with anchovies and crispy crab croutons. I have never tried anchovies before, because I had heard they were gross, but man. It went perfectly with the salad. The crab croutons were my favorite from the salad, though. For our main course most of us got the 40 day dry aged ribeye (supposed to be the best in Chicago), while the birthday boy got the 55 day dry aged ribeye (supposed to be the best dry-aged steak in Chicago). My steak was huge, juicy, and perfectly cooked. I am a huge steak person, and this was perfection. Every bite was heaven in my mouth. We also all split three sides, including the basil whipped potato, creamy spinach and the caramelized carrots. The sides were probably the least impressive to me. The basil whipped potatoes tasted like regular mashed potatoes, the creamy spinach was too bacon-y for my taste, but I'm not a big fan of pork, and the caramelized carrots were a little off for me. Out of the three, I probably liked the mashed potatoes the best, but I didn't think any of them were outstanding.

None of us ordered it, but they brought it over and I didn't check it if it was on the bill) and the cake in a can. I didn't try the donuts, because I'm not a big donut fan either (I know..I'm weird. I don't like bacon or donuts.) The cake in the can though....holy cow. IT WAS SO DARN GOOD! It was so moist and tasty and it was also served table side which was a cool experience. I think the cake might have been my favorite part of the meal, besides the steak of course, so I HIGHLY recommend that. During our dinner, our server Stacey was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. If she didn't know the answer to something or thought someone could better explain something, she would seek another person out (ex. we wanted wine, so she brought over the wine guy).

I should state that the service is spectacular. Throughout the meal out server was attentive and handled the night very well all things considered.  The food on the other hand is just not the quality you'd expect from a $100 per person restaurant. The appetizers and drinks are good, but the steaks were all cooked wrong...we had 3 and sent two back because they were inedible. We did manage to eat the third although it was WAY undercooked for a medium rare (wish I had pics). Thankfully I have this review as reference so that I do not make the same mistake twice.

I've been to a handful of top steakhouses, and I can HANDS DOWN say that this is the best steakhouse that I have ever been to. I've done them all: Ruth's Chris, Flemings, Mortons. What we ordered: -- Appetizer - Wedge Salad - Tomato Bisque Soup - Waygu sashimi beef (not on Choose Chicago menu) -- Entree - Filet Medallions - 40 Day Dry Aged Steak Burger -- Sides - Mac and Cheese (Additional $5) - Truffle Asiago Fries (Additional $5) -- Stand things that come with meal: - Cheese Popover - Mashed Potatoes - Mushrooms -- Dessert - Taste of Primehouse sampler platter The service, the presentation, the food.  From start to finish the meal was amazing. We came for lunch and it wasn't crowded, the ambiance was still high end but not pretentious. The meat was AMAZING. cooked to perfection. I ordered the medallions to be medium rare and they was absolutely (positively) perfect. The inside was red, very little blood seeped out when i put pressure on to it, but the outer 2mm of the medallion were cooked...perfectly. It wasn't charred, still soft and tender, with the mouth watering flavor was locked inside. I cannot express in greater detail how absolutely perfect these filet medallions were. I would order them again and again and again. I had a taste of the burger but it was no where near as dreamy as the filet medallions. The steak burger patty was juicy, but the overall taste of the burger was definitely packed with lots of complimenting flavors. It was quite bold in taste. The mac and cheese was -- sooooo unique. Not the standard creamy texture or gooey dense cheese packed mac and cheese I was expecting, but it was still great. Definitely worth trying if you want to expand your breadth of mac and cheese. I'd order it again. The mashed potatoes and mushrooms weren't great, but they were still a nice part of the meal. I wish I had more room for the truffle fries. They were absolutely to.die.for. A sucker for fries in general, these were some of the best fries I've ever had. Crispy and doused in seasonings and toppings and truffles of the perfect amount.  The dessert sampler wasn't anything out of the ordinary. But it was presented beautifully and everything was delicious. Nothing too signature or crazy, but it was a nice end to the meal. BUT THAT'S NOT IT: Two things (outside of the orgasmic filets) that really blew my mind, were the Wagyu Sashimi Beef plate and the silly cheese popover. There are no words for the wagyu sashimi, just order it. I feel as though every review mentions it, so just order it. It is perfection. The cheese popover?! -- I never knew I could have such strong feelings for an airy, crunchy, delicate, and fluffy piece of dough. I have had dreams about it. Don't take it for granted, and if someone at your table neglects it...casually steal theirs and devour it.

2014-02-22,2.0,"My boyfriend and I dined here with 2 other couples and we were excited to check out the ""#1 steakhouse in Chicago."" A few weeks ago we were WOWED at Bavette's (rated 5 stars by me, #2 by Chicago's Best) so needless to say, we had high hopes. Coming from the suburbs, we arrived early due to lack of traffic and grabbed a seat at the bar for a cocktail while we waited for the rest of our party. The bar service was pretty terrible; we sat down and weren't even greeted, nodded to, or anything for at least 5-8 minutes. Finally, a bartender walked by and propped a bar menu up in front of us, without a greeting and walked away. After we looked at the menu and made our decisions, we waited another 5-8 minutes for the bartender to return. I must also add that the bar was not overly busy denoting the less than prompt service. I ordered a martini and my boyfriend ordered the house Manhatten. Good cocktails.  We had an 8pm reservation and they were a few minutes behind, no big deal. We sat down at the table and the service was pretty good, the waiter made good recommendations and was very knowledgable on the dry aging process and menu. He answered all of our questions well. I ordered a bone-in filet medium rare and was less than impressed. The beauty of a filet (in my opinion) is the buttery, melt-in-your-mouth texture that is to die for and this was absolutely not it. The steak was good, but not great- definitely not even close to the best steak I've ever had. We also ordered the Mac-n-cheese (phenomenal), green beans (great), creamed spinach (great) and sweet potatoes (good).  We also ordered the made to order red velvet cake (order this first) which was just lovely. We also were taken downstairs for a tour of the dry aging room which was really unique, interesting, and unexpected. Props for that. My 2 star rating comes from the fact that as a high-end steakhouse, I did not receive the quality of service, or product that other steakhouses in that category have achieved in my book. Also, we did valet our car, and upon retrieving it, we were handed our keys and told that it was ""just around the corner."" Last time I checked, I didn't pay $32 to valet a car I'd have to walk out in the cold, hunt down, and retrieve myself. I could have parked in the garage, paid less and walked a whole 10 steps more.

2014-02-21,4.0,"I've never taken much of a liking to meat; as a kid I would gobble up my veggies, but push most of the meat around on my plate until, in exasperation or annoyance, my dad would take it off my hands. So, it might be strange for me to review a place like David Burke's let alone give it four stars. My manfriend, unlike me, is a carnivore through and through. He had been hankering for a good steak dinner and picked David Burke's for our date. We arrived a little early for our reservation and grabbed a seat in the bar-area. Unless you're seated at the bar, it feels a bit sterile. We got a few drinks, the spicy El Santo and the sweet The James. I don't usually like martini-ish drinks, usually finding them too strong or too sweet. The James was a perfect balance of the two. The pretzels they serve are dipped in some sort of fantastic oil, I recommend asking for some. We were seated at a booth in the restaurant, which was nice and secluded; it wasn't until we were settling up that I realized most of the place had cleared out. Shortly after being seated, our popovers were delivered. I'm a bread-aholic and if given the chance, I could've made a meal out of them. We started with their deconstructed crab cake, which was crusted in the aforementioned pretzels. It was quite delectable and gone before we knew it; one barely stretches between two people. For dinner he ordered the 40-day ribeye, which he had been dreaming about and I ordered the seared ahi. We also ordered two sides, caramelized carrots with goat cheese for me and a duck confit side on special; we later learned the latter had sold out. He mooned over his steak - fortunately I'm not really the jealous type - and ate every last bite. My ahi was good, but frankly not a standout.  I may not be a meat eater, but this isn't my first rodeo at a steakhouse. I've come to expect impeccable service and big portions. Primehouse didn't disappoint in the service department; we received a bonus side of gnocchi as a replacement dish and they were kind enough to offer to serve the creamed spinach (our second choice) with the bacon on the side so I could enjoy it. What was a bit disappointing was the portion size of my entree and our sides; by steakhouse standards they fell on the small side. Primehouse's dessert menu is impressive; vast and extensive it includes sweets, cheeses, teas, dessert cocktails and wines. We passed on the dessert drinks and got a Manhattan for him and an El Santo for me. We also ordered the kickin' doughnuts, mini doughnut holes that come with bottles of caramel, pear ginger, and vanilla to fill yourself. I love the concept of the dish and the way it comes out in a small fry basket, but it's not the most practical dish. Because of their small size, squeezing the filling in isn't worth the effort, however ripping them in half and squirting them with sauce gets the job done. While I don't understand my partner in crime's love affair with steak, I would return to David Burke's for a meal.",0.9983,0.808,0.169,0.023,0.44101731601731603

2014-02-20,4.0,"I could not temper my excitement to try David Burke's. Being a big fan of the steakhouses in Chicago (there are a ton of them); many of my friends have given David Burke's high recommendation. For whatever reason, this place has always eluded me (mostly due to the wait and the lack of takers). But finally, we went for my friend's birthday (which happened to land on Restaurant Week). While the Restaurant Week offerings seemed like a great value, I really was there to try the famous dry aged steaks. When arriving, we were informed that only the restaurant week offerings were available (without the ability to order ala cart), bummer. But I won't hold this against them, pretty special circumstance, but it was a huge let down that we couldn't get the giant slice of Red Velvet Cake that my friends had raved about. Here's what I ended up getting anyways.  Cocktail Shrimp - these shrimp were huge. So huge that they had to bring out a monster bowl of ice to make the shrimp actually look like shrimp. While they were meaty and monstrous, they lacked the full flavor that I would expect out of a shrimp that size. Overall, it felt like great value, but it wasn't the best I've ever had.  45-dry aged Ribeye - great crust, great flavor, and it came out at the perfect temperature. I can see why all my friends recommended trying this place. The steak itself was massive and had great textures all around (even in the fatty portions).  Mashed Potatoes & Sautéed Mushroom - both these sides were a bit disappointing. I have high expectations of steak sides at places of this caliber, and both of them seemed a bit plain. The potatoes were not as fluffy as I'd like, and the mushrooms, while tasty, could've used an extra element.  Trio of Desserts - This trio of desserts consisted of a cheesecake on the stick, a scoop of vanilla Homer's ice cream, and a slice of peanut butter chocolate cake. I think it's a bit unfair, because I really wanted the red velvet cake, and I think my disappointment may have caused this to pale in comparison. They just seemed a bit plain, and nothing to write home about.  Overall, while I was disappointed at being forced to order off the Restaurant Week menu, the overall quality of David Burke's was above average (for a steak house). The sides were a bit disappointing, but I'm sure it was due to the limited selection. Had I been able to order the sides I have a tendency towards, I'm sure it would've been better for my needs. Dry aged steaks have a very distinct flavoring and texture to them, and may not be a taste that everyone really enjoys, but I enjoyed the preparation and the overall taste of the steak.

2014-02-11,4.0,"Had been wanting to dine here ever since seeing David Burke's steakhouse concept featured on Travel Channel's Steak Paradise. The restaurant's interior is dimly lit which added to its intimate and classy atmosphere.  When it came to ordering, our server was able to explain and answer all of our questions regarding the items on the menu. He explained the how their steaks are unique due to the fact that they are dry-aged. For those who aren't familiar with dry-aged steaks, it's a type of preparation which draws moisture out and breaks down muscle tissue so that the steak is incredibly tender and gives it a melt-in-your-mouth quality. After hearing the server's mouthwatering description, of course we had to try the steaks out. We ordered several items including the surf and turf dumplings, shrimp and grits, veal sweetbreads, 40 day ribeye and the kickin' donuts. We started off our meal with their popovers served in measuring cups, a nice change from typical bread service. The surf and turf dumplings consisted of lobster and short rib fillings which were delicious. My friends' shrimp and grits was a bit overdone, which was disappointing, but the next course more than made up for it. The star of the meal was definitely the 40 day ribeye. The worst part was taking my last bite and realizing I had devoured it all. The ribeye had a nice crust with deep beefy flavor from the dry aging process which made the meat extremely tender. I could eat this everyday! I will have to come back and dry the 55 day or 75 day ribeyes for sure. We ended the meal on a sweet note with the kickin' donuts which came with different sauces to fill the little fried fritters. The dinner service was great; the staff were quick to refill drinks and discard empty plates.

I had the regular menu filet, but upgraded with the Oscar addition (crab, asparagus, and hollandaise sauce). My steak was cooked great, as was my husband's. We both enjoyed the mashed potatoes and the mushrooms. I was impressed with the amount of crab and with the size of my filet. The dessert was a trio of treats...a cake pop, ice cream, and a little slice of cake. All three treats were tasty.  In general, our service was fine, our food and drinks were good, and ambiance/decor of the place is fine too. I guess I just expected a little something more.

The waiter told me that the color (lack or redness) was due to the dry aging process. If you look at the menu, it actually states the following: ""steaks may vary in color due to the dry-aging process.""

2014-01-29,4.0,"My wife and I were in Chicago over a weekend and tried David Burke's for Saturday lunch, wanting to try their vaunted dry aged beef we had heard so much about. The weekend ""Saturday and Sunday Brunch"" menu is different from the weekday version and offers limited fare, no doubt because they are in a hotel and would be closed otherwise. However, they offer their steaks any time. We were seated in the sparsely populated elegant dining room. The décor was elegant but not overly so. There were small solid bowls of their Himalayan salt on the tables for a novelty that added some interest. My wife said we were not supposed to lick the bowls. Oh well. I ordered the 55-day bone-in rib eye (reputed 20 oz), my wife only the arugula salad, and we shared the meat and sides. Our sides were green beans, egg covered asparagus and truffle mashed potatoes. I pinned down the waiter on how the meat would be cooked. I wanted some assurance it would be medium-rare. My son had been there a few weeks earlier and his was over cooked, but he did not complain. Our waiter assured us he would emphasize our preference to the cook. It came out perfect. The flavor was the characteristic meaty flavor of dry aged beef and it was excellent. There was only a scant piece of bone. There was no bread served on the week ends, but after much cajoling they supplied some very good popovers. The potatoes were tasty but cold; the other sides were very good. The wait staff was professional, attentive and accommodating. My only complaint is the lack of their full complement of meals on the week end. If I visit the windy city again, I will try them at an optimum time. However, after reading many bad reviews, I must conclude there is a chance, small I hope, of a bad experience. The resident manager, a petite young lady, graciously gave us a tour of the beef aging room, explaining their aging operation: very impressive. Their Himalayan salt set up is intriguing and seems to produce good results. We enjoyed the tour very much. I don't recommend steaks on the week ends, and can only give a rating of four this time.

Next, we got to choose from Salmon, Chicken, Filet Medallions, or the Burker (burger made with 40-day aged beef). I chose the filet medallions, which was surprisingly not overcooked.

We started with some Bloody Marys and they hit the spot on yet another cold Chicago day.  There was a good amount of horseradish in them. We both gave them a thumbs up.  Next they bring out a popover with an asiago or parmesan crust on top.  This is served with some butter with pink Himalayan sea salt.  I loved this.   For the appetizers I chose the Tomato Bisque with crab and my husband had the East and West Coast Oysters.  Both were very good.  The Oysters were fresh, I think the East Coast were a little better than the West even though I typically prefer West.  We were not told which oysters they were.  The Bisque was flavorful and had a decent amount of crab on it.   For the main course we had  40 day dry aged steak burger:  This was a good burger.. Had some nice flavor and the shallots and garlic mayo were a good addition Filet Mignon Medallions- These were 2 3oz medallions in a marsala sauce.  This was ok for me.  Not a ton of flavor, one of the medallions seemed  little over cooked, one cooked a perfect medium which was a little tastier.  It was good, but didnt wow me.   for the sides they were roasted mushrooms and basil whipped potatoes.  I loved the mushrooms, they had a great flavor and were roasted to perfection.  The potatoes were good.  Again didnt wow me.   For Dessert there was a trio:  Cheesecake lollipop with a chocolate toffee coating.  This was great!  House made chocolate ice cream- this was very good as well.  And Mini Prime cake- this was a chocolate cake with a chocolate mousse and a marshmallow topping.  I love smores like desserts, but this cake didnt do it for me.   Our server was great and we really enjoyed the lunch but overall I would just call it average.  It was a good meal, but not a great meal and I dont know if I would seek the restauarant out and with Joe's right down the road I would probably go there first but I may check it out again and judge them on their dry aged steaks.",0.9974,0.776,0.201,0.023,0.6043985890652557

The only reason why I couldn't give this place a 5 star is because of two reasons.  I prefer my steaks not to have gravy or sauce on it.  I want to try the meat as is with light salt and pepper to season.  This I feel gives the true taste of the meat.  The gravy did cover up the taste of the steak and  I would've asked for it differently had I known the gravy would be on the steak.   Service was excellent.  I've been to other restaurants during restaurant week and have been given horrible service for chosing the restaurant week menu.  Here, there was none of this animosity.  The server was professoinal, very attentive, and even the manager came up to our table and checked in on us.   I am very happy and would come back for a special date.",0.9809,0.836,0.128,0.036,0.6952791461412152

It was an emotional time for the both of us and we picked this place in hopes that it would be a nice quiet night of good food where we can just have a good time talking (drinking and eating). And it definitely was! Our server that first night was just ok. He really needed to get some kind of sense of humor...His fellow servers and front of the house staff were much lighter in mood when they stopped by to check in on us thankfully.  The second time we came here was just for drinks and appetizers as one of our stops on New Years Eve.

FOOD: We had a plan... In order to taste everything that we wanted to, we opted to split a steak. My husband and I are big on appetizers and small plates, so going this route insured that we wouldn't miss out on all the courses this place had to offer. Actually we do this in most restaurants... Anyway, we started with BACON (sticks) - being huge bacon/pork belly fans, these were just ok. We've had better but if you're here and you have the room - order them. We also ordered the WAGYU BEEF SASHIMI (served with himalayan salt, mushroom chips and truffle mayo). SO YUMMY! We both loved it so much, it was our deciding factor for coming back on New Years Eve. TRUFFLE ASIAGO FRIES - when taking our order, our server asked us if we wanted fries since they were only $5... SURE, we replied. And we were glad that we did. We ate each and every one of them tasty fries! Our main course included two sides - asparagus and mac n'cheese. If we had read more carefully, we would not have ordered the asparagus as it came with picked cranberry sauce. Not a big fan but we love asparagus. For our main dish - the 55 DAY AGED RIBEYE! HEAVEN! It was so juicy and tasty. A lot of food for us but well worth it all.  DRINKS: probably one of the best Moscow Mules I've had in the city and as my husband states, ""the best martini with blue cheese olives"" that he'd ever had.

2014-01-17,5.0,"This was posted on my blog - check it out -http://eatinginchicago2014.wordpress.com Gilt City sponsored a groupon-like deal for the Primehouse, just before it was listed Best Steakhouse in Chicago by Chicago magazine - $198 for a 4-course dinner for two, plus wine pairings - usually a deal like this would include scaled down versions of some of their dishes - a petite filet, a side salad, but this deal included some of the best stuff off of David Burke's menu - including its 55-day dry-aged bone in ribeye.  Wo the wine pairings, this would have been a pretty good deal, but add in the drinks, and it's a no brainer. Where/s the best steakhouse in Chicago?  You can debate this for hours, and obviously there's no right answer.  For me, though David Burke's bests them all.   What makes a great steakhouse?   Most of the top-end steakhouses use USDA-prime beef, so quality of meat is pretty uniform - (although David Burke advertises that all their beef is sired from the same bull, aptly named ""Prime"".   Then there's the preparation, although again - most broil the steaks at a super high temp to get that excellent crisp outside, while keeping that juicy, red medium rare inside (if that's how you like it)  Consistency of cooking?  Few of these places would be in business if they couldn't perfectly cook a medium rare steak to perfection. So then, it comes down to three things, in my opinion. The first is the aging process - wet-aged vs. dry-aged.   David Burke's dry-ages its steaks in a room lined with Himalayan salt bricks - sounds fancy, and you can see the room, after which you may never want to eat dry aged steaks again.   That is, until you have some of the dry-aged beef, which is does just create the deepest, intense flavor (particularly when it's cut right off of bone-in cut) you can get on a steak.  The longer the aging, the taste almost becomes gamey in flavor.   Different people enjoy the better tenderness in a wet aged cut The second is the ambience - looking for an old school environment and feel like you went back in time?  Go to the Chop House or Gene & Georgetti's.   Something with a bit of hustle and bustle?  Check out Chicago Cut or Gibson's.  Want the more modern chic take?   Mastro's and David Burke's will fit the bill. The third is the quality of the apps, salads, and sides - and this is where I think David Burke's stands above - on to the review.... Came in on a Friday night - it's not the hardest place to get a reservation, as long as you plan a few days in advance, but probably don't plan on going on a weekend and walking in. The meal starts the first thing that sets David Burke's apart - instead of bread service - you get a popover - this time a bit overcooked, but still great as always - airy, buttery, with a hint of what I think is asiago cheese...add a little Himalayan salt butter Next comes the apps, perfect size, as they weren't overlying filling, but intensely flavorful.  The lobster dumpling was a bit meh, but the braised short rib dumping was fantastic, perfectly braised beef with a hint of spicy mustard on the side.  The wagyu sashimi, served on a Himalayan salt brick, was sliced to a nice thickness, and the truffle mayo was enough to give it a nice truffle flavor without being overpowering.  The mushroom chips add a bit of crunchy texture to the thin tender wagyu. Then rolls in Burke's classic caesar salad, which they spin tableside - mixing a healthy amount of anchovy with the traditional garlic, oil, and parmesan.  In addition though, they add a healthy amount of chili oil to give the caesar a perfect amount of kick that makes this one of the best Caesar's in the city.... The steak, 55 day dry-aged bone-in ribeye - perfectly cooked, great marbled fat interspersed.  Just an awesome cut of beef.  Unfortunately, getting pretty stuffed at this time (what with the wine pairings and all), so I couldn't finish it all, but that just leaves a great 2nd meal - plan to toss it in the toaster oven tonight for dinner!  In all seriousness, it doesn't get a whole lot better than this.  Great charred outside, perfectly cooked middle, great flavor as you cut from out to in until you get to those few bites next to the bone, which truly are the most flavorful. The sides were solidly cooked as well - the roasted carrots speak for themselves, fresh baby carrots - the bacon adds a nice touch to the creamed spinach, and then the gnudi added some starch for some balance.  Gnudi is essentially like gnocchi made with ricotta instead of potatoes. As full as we were at this point, there's always room for dessert!  Included was a piece of it's signature cake, the Slice of Prime, which is essentially a two layered chocolate cake, the bottom a traditional chocolate flour cake, topped with a layer of a chocolate cream cake, with an almost mousse-like consistency.  The kicker is the topping - a layer of burnt marshmallow - served with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream - a perfect end to a perfect m",0.9994,0.763,0.19,0.047,0.529185014507595
2014-01-16,1.0,"Below is the email I wrote to the general manager of the restaurant and James hotel.  I was hoping for a response so I didn't have to post this on yelp but no one responded.   I made a reservation on October 23rd and had been looking forward to enjoying the  ""#1"" steak house in Chicago.    While some of these items are minor on a stand-alone basis when aggregated together over the course of a dinner they make for a disappointing evening. Touch point #1 - Entering the restaurant. We tried to enter through the main door and the valet waived us off and rudely pointed us to the other door.  He didn't greet and had a scowl on his face.   Touch point #2 - The hostess didn't even say ""hi,"" we were greeted with a blank stare and we had to initiate the conversation.  We asked how she was doing and she didn't respond.  We waited patiently to get our table in a not so full restaurant. While we waited a very nice gentleman (maybe the manager?) finally acknowledged and welcomed us.  We were surprised to be seated at the table located by the hostess stand next to the revolving door.  We should have just sat at the bar and after the whole experience we wish we did.  Dinner- Our waiter Scott was curt and condescending.  He seemed less then interested to engage with us.  He seemed to be upset that we didn't order the most expensive items on the menu.  We ordered two Caesar salads (one my husband and I were going to share and one for our friend) and he was very offended that we didn't order three.  Then finally he said he would split one for both us and ultimately we were billed for three.  The 40 day steaks were delicious.  I ordered a lobster for myself because I was going to share a steak with my husband.  Again, Scott was disappointed that I wasn't ordering an expensive dish.  He pushed us to order the crab legs. The sides were blah... mac and cheese was very dry and tasted like it had been sitting out for hours.  Not sure what the soggy (supposed to fried) stuff was on top.  The carrots did not have any flavor to them.   Drinks - the sommelier was the nicest person in the restaurant.  She found us an amazing wine in our price range.  She patiently explained how each wine would go with our meal. She was professional and courteous.   Ladies Bathroom - I walked in and almost slipped.  The floors were wet (as if they were just mopped) but there was no sort of ""wet floor"" sign.  I walked into one stall and the lock was ripped off the door.  When I went to dry my hands the Dyson hand dryer had hair in it.   I understand that restaurants have off nights.  But this ""off"" night was at a $475 expense.  I was just really disappointed.  I work at a boutique hotel close to the restaurant and had recently told a client about your private dining space as an offsite dinner venue and based on my experience I now regret the recommendation.",0.9813,0.821,0.114,0.065,0.572746913580247

2014-01-03,2.0,"So I hate people who write bad reviews for restaurants that most people like - I always think they're difficult, picky, or have unrealistic expectations.  Personally, I rarely write reviews for anything, and I have never written a negative review of a restaurant - until now. First, the vibe - not good.  This place is bright, I don't think any music is was playing, and it felt in general like a very average, crappy hotel restaurant.  I expect a decent steak place, modern or otherwise, to be dark, playing jazz, with their wines on full display.  None of that here. We started with a couple of cocktails, which were very good (server recommended Whistle Pig for my manhattan, which I love). Then, the food - bacon sticks, which were average and a bit chewy.  I had the lobster bisque next, which was not very hot but otherwise good.  My wife had the foie gras, which she found average.  I also had the wedge salad, which was good. The dry-aged ribeyes came with all the Himalayan salt room hype - my wife got the 55 day, and I got the 40 to compare.  The meat was not tender.  The flavor was not great.  The price was absurd.  The sides that came with it were also underwhelming - boring mushrooms, tempura green beans that were undercooked (I've had significantly and consistently better at PF Chang's, sadly), and worst of all, mac and cheese that was so bad, I longed for a box of Kraft mac and cheese to replace it - to be clear, the cheese was not even melted, and all of the sides were served luke warm or colder.  It was inexplicable, to be honest. Like idiots, we ordered the donuts for dessert - not sure how these qualify as donuts, but the round balls of dough and DIY sauce injectors did not hit the mark. A couple of good things - we had a nice bottle of Shafer cab (all four sommeliers were out, apparently, which seems ridiculous, so we made the call ourselves), as well as excellent service from our primary waiter...hence the two stars.  But for $600, I expect much, much more. David Burke is a great chef, but this place is not doing his reputation justice.  I cannot imagine why Chicago Mag recently voted this place the best steak in Chicago - I am hoping it was the hype.  I'm confident Chicago has much better options for steak - especially for the next four months when Next rolls out Chicago Steak.",0.9248,0.759,0.135,0.106,0.6294133644133645

Our waiter Corey made sure we were completely comfortable without hovering, and had a great sense of humor that made the entire experience a joy. In my mind, there is nothing finer than a dry-aged ribeye, and these folks do it up right. Surprisingly though, I think my wife's 35 day aged strip might have topped my 55 day aged ribeye, slightly thicker and maybe a bit more flavor - but bottom line: these are serious steaks. Apps and sides were wonderful, with the only exception being the mac and cheese - oddly enough this steakhouse-staple was dry and uncheesy.

I ate the ends and my husband are the thick center cut. He had ordered the Ribeye and his was not nearly as flavorful, and frankly a bit dry.  Caesar Salad: A+ Delicious! They made it fresh by your table. Worth every penny and calorie. Get it. Truffle fries: A Delicious as well. The truffle wasn't too overwhelming and it balanced the rest of the meal well.

We all got the 55 day aged ribeye.  I can see why people complain that its dry.  The outer rim of the steak is a bit dryer and stiffer, probably partly due to the process.  The center of the steak was very tasty though.  Really, if they cut off too much, we'd end up with ribeyes the size of filets so I guess I understand..  It is neat that the flavor profile changes so much as you move through the ribeye.  However, I'm not positive I'm a fan of the pink Himalayan salt walls as I felt like the meat was on the saltier side.  The sides on the other hand were very bland.  We tried the creamed spinach, mac and cheese, sauteed mushrooms and mashed potatoes.  The potatoes and mushrooms were fine but the others needed salt. I also got to try some of the seared tuna.  It was actually the best dish I tried there.   All in all, for the price I thought the sides would be a LOT better.  It was disappointing to not get a dish we ordered as well.  Other than this, the service was pretty good.  The sommelier wasn't as helpful as they presented him to be although the wine we picked out, and most likely all the wines on their menu, was fine.  They may have won a prize for best aged steak (which I didn't verify), but they definitely didn't win for any other dish.",0.9931,0.734,0.191,0.075,0.4817748917748917

This is supposed to be their best steak? The flavor was almost nonexistent compared to the 55-day aged. The meat was so tough and flavorless and overcooked (also ordered medium rare) that it was like chewing steak from a cheap vegas buffet. We honestly couldn't even finish it.  4. Sides of asparagus and potatoes: all in much need of some salt.....and I normally like bland food so this was REALLY bland. Service was ok. We arrived a couple minutes early before they opened for dinner. The hostess told us to give her a couple minutes and told us to wait in the bar/lobby.

(meal highlight) However, the reason we came here primarily was to try the 75 day dry-aged ribeyes. We ordered two, which for some reason were totally different from one another to the point where I think one wasn't the right piece, even though both were totally overrated. Yes, the beef flavor in the steak which I suspect was actually aged 75 days was intense, but it didn't make the meat taste better than any other strip i've had elsewhere. In fact, I would go as far a saying that the steak on it own was inferior to virtually every other high-end steakhouse I have been to in the city, and that is a lot! Others at the table order lamb chops which I didn't get to try so I can't comment on. We also pre-orderd the red velvet cake for dessert and it was fine.

To begin we ordered a bottle of the Inglenook Syrah and a half dozen wellfleets.  The wine was really nice and it would have been even better if it were decanted, however this wasn't offered.  The wellfleets were very fresh, but of the three I had, two were shucked improperly with shell bits in the oyster as well as not being removed properly from the shell. We placed our order for dinner next, I ordered the bone-in filet medium rare and my husband ordered the 55 day dry aged ribeye, they were out of the 75 day.  He also ordered his medium rare.  For sides and salads we had the tableside caesar, the lump crab whipped potatoes, steamed green beans, and a half lobster to share.  When our dinner arrived at a little after 9:30, we were pretty happy to see it.  The salad would have been nice served on chilled salad plates with chilled forks.  As far as the steaks go, my steak was cooked perfectly, my husband's was more medium well and overcooked.  Our server was fantastic and promptly took it back to the kitchen.  Less than 5 minutes later a manager delivered his new ribeye which was perfect.  I really enjoyed the flavor of the filet and other items, the ribeye not so much.  We both agreed it was really beefy for our taste, but unique and glad we tried it.  The bone in filet was definitely the winner, with a nice char on the outside and cooked perfectly on the inside.  The lobster was tasty but it would have been nice if it were served with smaller forks for prying the meat out instead of salad sized forks.  For dessert we finished with a port and the de-constructed carrot cake.  This was very Achatz-like and I appreciated the artsy-playfulness of the dish.  Overall we enjoyed our experience, however I am with a lot of the other reviewers here... I think there are some areas for improvement in order to warrant a 5 star from me.",0.9985,0.821,0.175,0.004,0.5835284664830118

We started with the Lobster Bisque and Wagyu Beef Sashimi. The soup had a sweet taste and the apple flavor was prominent. Not what I was expecting because it was different from all other lobster bisque I've tasted.   The Wagyu Sashimi was definitely a winner. Everything about it was phenomenal. Just order it. That's all I need to say about that. My entree was the 55 Day Ribeye. As a steak addict, I can easily say that this was the best steak I have ever eaten! I've been to the big name places like Morton's, Ruth's Chris, Maestro's, and STK but this steak was just on another level. The pure beefy flavor that comes from the dry aging is much like a nice aged cheese. It may be overpowering if you do not eat steak often but my girlfriend isn't much of a beef eater yet she loved it. Definitely need to try the 75 day steak the next time I'm in Chicago.

Started with the bacon sticks appetizer which was not bad but certainly not mind-blowing. It was cubes of really fatty bacon dipped in maple syrup. Once you've had one, you don't really need another.  Ordered the 44 day aged ribeye for my main course since this is what they're famous for and had high expectations. The ribeye was kind of burned on the outside, which was okay for me. My main complaints is the consistency of the steak. It took away what I love most about ribeye. It was kind of dry and there also wasn't that much flavor. The dryness really killed it for me though.  Sides ordered were mushrooms with onions (meh), asparagus with poached eggs (pretty good) and truffle asiago fries (excellent).  Overall, the best parts of my dining experience here was the bacon sticks and truffle fries. Maybe I just can't appreciate the aging process and what it does to the ribeye.

I don't throw exaggerated, wild statements out there on Yelp folks. i respect the individual using this review to make a decision and ... the shit was good. I like my steak medium rare, and though David Burke is more well know for their aged cuts, this piece came out with the perfect amount of pink and almost a carmelized outside. It tasted like they had rubbed it with butter, but I really think it was more of a searing style. Delicious ... - ORDER THE RED VELVET CAKE - I'm telling you, order it. Growing up, I spent my summers in the south, and I've always hated red velvet cake because its so heavy and thick with (of all things) a pound of sour cream icing on top. NOT David Burke's Red Velvet. You order this item in the beginning of the meal, and the chef prepares the cake in a tin. The tin is put in the oven, and the cake is iced at the table. It was the perfect end to the meal.  - Great wine selection.  - VERY reasonably priced. YO business guys, I'm talking to you. If you are like me, you have to stay within a specific entertainment budget, and for 3 people - I paid $190 with tip. This was for 3 alcohol beverages, 1 salad, appetizers, 2 steaks (1 bone in and 1 T-Bone), 3 sides, and 1 cake. Not too bad at all. Chop House would have charged at least $300.

2013-08-30,5.0,"Fantastic steak house and I have tried about 25 of Chicago's best (as well as many of the best across the country).  I was starting to feel that even the best steak houses could differentiate themselves but David Burke did. First, fantastic starter, bacon on a stick.  A lover of bacon, it was better than I thought.  The serving consisted of fives sticks of pork belly, with very robust and complex flavor.  I was looking forward to it but it was an order of magnitude better than I expected. They also found a way to differentiate a bone-in ribeye.  Often a great cut, I had the 55-day dry aged option.  You could really taste the dry-aging and it gave the steak a nice, unique flavor.  The one drawback was that the cut was a little smaller than you would get at a Mastro's or Del Friscos (two of my other favorites) but it was nice to have a steak that stood out. I also loved the truffled mashed potatoes.  The truffle flavor came through and it was a great side. Ended with the red velvet cake in a can, which you had to order at the beginning of the meal.  I am not huge for desserts but I liked the gimmick and warm cake with some caramelized crust was a great end to the meal. Also as noted, the service was very professional but not stuffy.  Five stars, good job differentiating yourself.",0.9969,0.712,0.26,0.028,0.5433854166666667

2013-08-25,3.0,"My visit was in March of this year. I had heard a lot about their Himalayan Salt locker where they age their beef and thought I'd give it a try. Lucky for me, it was Chicago Chef Week. I made my selection off of the tasting menu.  First Course: Pan Roasted Veal Sweetbreads with pickled mushrooms, house prosciutto and duck fat potatoes. The potatoes were the best part. It was my first time ever trying sweetbreads and I wasn't a fan due to texture issues, but hey, maybe I just shouldn't have ordered the sweetbreads. My fault not theres. Second Course: 40 day aged Delmonico Ribeye medium rare with brie whipped potatoes, brussels sprouts and horseradish jus. This was amazing. My steak was perfectly cooked. It was a great cut and wonderfully marbleized.The brie whipped potatoes? Oh My God. How can you go wrong with brie and potatoes though really? They accented the steak in a wonderful way. The brussels sprouts were cooked very nicely and still had a bit of a crunch which was nice and the horse radish jus wasn't overpowering over the steak. All in all, amazing. Third Course (dessert): Citrus & Honey: Mandarin cream, grapefruit pound cake, honey ice cream, and almond praline. The poundcake was delicious. I wasn't expecting the grapefruit to be as strong as it was in the cake but they nailed it. The cream and honey ice cream were perfect complement.  Because it was my first time at this restaurant and Chicago in general, I asked to see the Himalayan Salt locker. It was kind of a let down as it was only one small portion of the wall that has the salt and wasn't really what I was expecting. The manager who took my boyfriend and I down there though was very knowledgeable and was patient with our questions.  The decorum doesn't really reflect the food served or the price range in which their offerings are sold. As a fine dining restaurant, I was hoping for a more intimate setting.

High marks for the popovers to kick off the meal, bacon sticks with syrup along with octopus sticks were very good, and the table side Caesar which I expected to be gimmicky was outstanding. Ordered the 40 day bone-in ribeye and the flavor of the aged beef was outrageously good. You could just savor every bite, and it was a big steak. Only problem was that medium rare was missed and the steak was closer to medium - was not worth sending back in my opinion. Sides of asparagus, mashed potatoes, and mushrooms all hit the spot. Mac and cheese was quite forgettable, and borderline confusing in the taste department. But all in all, a great first visit.

The food was okay, and for two of us, the bill was $400. What was so offensive was the lack of service for those kind of prices. I get better service at a diner for a $20 meal. The wait staff did a great job of ignoring us throughout the evening for no good reason, other than we had 9pm reservations, and they all seemed like they were too tired to care at that time. When I finally met the manager, I realized the reason for such poor service, he too was worthless and couldn't care. Truth is, my company was paying, I didn't want anything free, I wanted someone to just care. And they didn't.  After telling everyone I could, I'm in sales, I decided to guess at David Burke's email, and he didn't have the respect to either respond for the restaurant, or at the very least have someone other than that same idiot manager write back. The response to my email was even more offensive than the experience. What a shame. I've told all of my clients and colleagues in Chicago to stay away from this place. There are so many wonderful steak houses, and this is a very tired one. Don't waste your time or your money here. Time to get a better team to handle clients than the ones you have now David.

My steak was so bland I kept adding salt for taste. The only redeeming aspect was the Red Velvet cake.

2013-08-14,5.0,"Dry Aged Ribeye For The Win!!! I've heard mixed reviews about David Burkes spot here in Chicago, but it has always been on my list of steakhouses that I needed to check out. Unfortunately, during our visit they didn't have the 75-day Aged Ribeye available. I guess I'll just have to come back and try it out.  Cheese Puff Bread - a very pleasant start to the meal. This puts a lot of starter bread out there in restaurants to complete shame! Add the salted butter and it definitely kicks the flavor intensity up another notch.  Wagyu Sashimi - possibility the best beef sashimi that I have ever had. Served on a block of Himalayan salt and a side of garlic aioli. Each component of this dish had an absolute purpose. The flavor was so amazing. I could come back here simply for this appetizer.  40-Day Aged Ribeye - very good in its own right. I would never complain about eating this price if meat, but it was completely overshadowed by the 55-day aged ribeye. The flavor seemed to be a little less ""meaty"" but was still extremely flavorful.  55-Day Aged Ribeye - apparently the lost popular steak they sell and we couldn't agree more. A very simple steak, but the flavor is amazing. There are only a few steaks out there that have rendered me speechless. This is one of them. There was nothing fancy about this piece of meat other than the meat was able to stand on its own flavor alone. I can't wait to try the 75-day aged ribeye.  Oberon Cabernet Sauvignon - this wine paired extremely well with both ribeyes that we ordered. A definite must try.  Crab Whipped Mashed Potatoes - holy my Batman. Possibly the BEST mashed potatoes I've ever had. They was a good amount of crab in the dish, they certainly didn't skimp on it. The flavor was outstanding and the texture of the potatoes was superb.  Mac N Cheese - normally one of my favorite side dishes to order, but this one extremely disappointed us. The dish was cooked nicely, but it was lacking major flavor where a little salt and pepper could have really benefited the dish.  Truffle Fries - I'm a sucker for french fries, especially truffle fries. There was a nice amount of flavor on the fries and it was just enough where it didn't overpower the meal.  Ice Cream - we chose to order the Calamansi, Limoncello and Strawberry ice cream. Each individual flavor was delightful, light and delicious. Our overall favorite was the Calamansi since it was something different than the norm and had wonderful nodes of tangy and sweet attributes. The flavors were enhanced when you paired two or even all three of them together.  The service was impeccable. Not many restaurants could surpass the effort put forth by our server Nathan along with the rest of the staff. He was extremely attentive to our needs and was able to answer literally any and every question we threw his way with an intelligent and informed response. The rest of the wait staff took great care of us throughout the entirety of the meal as well.  We were able to venture down with the manager to check out the Dry Aging Room. It was truly every foodie and meat lovers dream!  All you have to do is ask! I'm definitely going to be back to try the 75-Day aged ribeye.

It is probably the best red velvet cake I've ever had. They even bring out the beaters in a measuring cup beforehand so you can taste the batter. I thought this was pretty cool.

We were seated promptly - table pulled out to get us seated more comfortably in the cozy booth. Our server was very relaxed and did not rush us at all, even with the 3 hour dining experience. A friend of mine ordered the 'Sticks & Stones' for her appetizer - it was a flat iron steak and shrimp on a skewer, set on a very hot rock. The server who presented it to us drizzled the Thai soy glaze on top and put the rest aside. It was stated that more sauce could have been given to keep the tenderness of the meat continuous and more flavorful. 3 skewers each, and the concept itself was very interesting and unique. I had the 20oz. 40 Day Aged Ribeye, bone-in from their 'Reserve Cut' section of the menu. This meat was said to be aged in their Himalayan salt room; I had ordered mine well-done (as always), and came out sizzling perfect with a garnish of a rosemary (that I just put aside). The server did say that it was a bit fatty due to it being a ribeye, but still excellent.  The meat itself was cooked wonderfully; the 20 oz. was not a problem for me to finish, since it does shrink on the grill and it was very tasty and juicy for me to gobble up. For a side, I had the Chorizo Whipped Potato, which I found it to be 'buttery' as one friend stated, and nothing as I expected it to be - maybe chunks of chorizo throughout the mashed potatoes would have enhanced the flavor, or more slices of the chorizo would have been a great balance with the mashed potatoes. Truffle Asiago Fries were ordered, and this seemed to taste better than the HB Bistro's version, served with ketchup. The Lobster fried rice was also ordered; rice could  have had a little bit less water to be cooked in and a lot less ginger chunks - otherwise, it was solid. Since it was an early birthday celebration, a dark chocolate ganache cake was brought out - not much of a dark chocolate fan, but this was actually bearable and not that sweet. It was served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream with sugar cookie-like chunks. I also wanted to try their infamous Cheesecake Lollipop Tree in which it was entwined with mini Christmas lights, and white- and dark-chocolate covered cheesecake balls on sticks. These you dip into a side bowl of whipped cream. There are also several raspberries garnishing the tree. It was pretty tasty, but definitely more than enough to share between 2-3 people.

Our server came over and explained the menu and was very friendly and helpful with our questions.  The ambiance, awesome. The service. fantastic. But the food? Somewhat feel flat. I expected so much more for the price. Our bill was over $400 and the steak was very average. We also didn't get any of the special treatment with seeing the dry aged steak room that everyone was talking about.  My steak was ordered medium and came out completely well done. It also looked completely different than the other steaks- while the others were thick with a charred crust, mine was thin and looked boiled. The waiter assured us that the chef cooked to temperature very accurately, but 2/3 of our steaks where not cooked properly. My husband's medium steak had blood and mine was cooked through.  The mac was great, but we all tasted the brussel sprouts and did a double take. Something was wrong. They were sour? We all agreed that something wasn't right and left them along. There is no way that is was the way that this was how they served them normally.  We finished the night was the de-constructed carrot cake (which was Gluten Free!) and it was incredible.  I had a nice evening and the ambiance is beautiful, but something was not right in the kitchen when I was there. Off-day? New chef?",0.9953,0.799,0.176,0.024,0.6056772613351559

I had the 55 day dry-aged steak, and it was excellent!  My wife and son had the Kansas City Cut, which I think I liked more only for the charred flavor.  My daughter had the ""Southside"".  When they brought it over, it was like when they brought Fred Flintstone his meat order and the car tipped over.....it was HUGE for her...like a pot roast.   Next visit, I may get one like this....it was SOOOO flavorful and tender.  My son and I were eyeing up her leftover big time!  I was hoping she'd forget it in the car so I could have it for lunch. So here's the topper.  As we are leaving the restaurant, the waitress hands me a bag.  In it is a gift of lunch the next day for all the fathers.....a prime-rib sandwich with pasta salad and a peanut butter brownie.  How classy!    So, overall, I'd highly recommend a visit to a classic Chicago Steak House.  Go and enjoy!",0.9958,0.771,0.204,0.025,0.5488405797101449

My husband had the lobster bisque, which he said was the best he'd ever had. The popovers that they serve as starter bread are awesome as well, and cleverly presented in little measuring cups.   For our entrees, my husband ordered the 40-day ribeye, which is dry-aged in the restaurants' Himilayan salt room. It was tender and very flavorful. I ordered the Greshburger, drawn in by the note that it was named ""Best Burger in the USA"" by Food + Wine magazine. This burger was no joke. The perfectly cooked, thick beef patty was topped with a layer of thinly shaved prime rib, which really made the burger something special. The taste of prime rib combined with the ground beef, smoked mozzerella, and morroccan-spiced ketchup that came on the side really put it over the top. The only thing that did not really stand out was the tempura veggies that came on the side. I liked the idea as an alternative to french fries, but I just didn't think they were that great.  We got two sides, the spinach gnocchi and the crab mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were excellent but the gnocchi was just ok.

These choices were strongly endorsed by our server (Stacie G., awesome all the way around). The meal: 1. Appetizer: Bacon on a stick. Sweet, meaty, unique...popular for a reason. 2. Salad: Caesar salad prepared table side. Not really any show involved in the presentation, it's just freshly prepared near your table. It's delicious! One of best we've had. Pass on crab cakes on top (kinda mediocre crab balls really). Anchovies really fishy, only get them on top if you love them. 3. 55 day aged ribeye and South Side (bone-in filet) steaks. Fantastic, cooked perfectly. Don't be too sold on the 75 day before you go. They were out of them (we had first reservations of the night at 5:30, so they started the night out of them). I understand this happens frequently, but that it may be for more hard core dry aged steak lovers anyway. Supposedly gets a little ""gamier"" aged that long?? 4. Sides: Mushrooms and onions = meh. Better with salt. Spinach gnocchi = also needed salt, pretty good. Truffle asiago fries = awesome! Loved these. 5. Dessert: Red velvet cake in a can. Order before your meal, serves 4-6 (cake for the next day, bonus!). Really good! For our anniversary they also brought us Kickin' Donuts. You squeeze delicious cream into yummy donut balls. Loved these! 6. Cocktails: Pricey! $13 a pop. The James = too heavy on the raspberry. The Mojito Diego = amazing! The bartender won some mojito award, best in Miami. I believe it. Lowlights: Pricey! Appetizer, salad, two steaks, three shared sides, dessert and 3 drinks each (plus one wine) = $328, before tip. Wow! Ambience = nothing bad really. Comfy leather booths. Just has a modern-y, yet retro-y look that might come up short of the prices. Seriously, not bad, just didn't wow us.

Crispy, salty outside and red, juicy inside- yum! My husband ordered the 50 something day aged ribeye and swear it is hands down the best steak he has had---ever! For our sides, we had the basil mashed potatoes and spinach gnocchi- yes you heard  that right, scrumptious little pillows of spinach in a creamy sauce. Both of which were excellent- no complaints.  At the end of the meal, we were asked if we wanted dessert ,and we replied with a no thank because cake was at home. Our waiter surprised us with dessert anyways, compliments of the house.  To top it off, we told our waiter that we were bringing the ribeye bone home for our 9 lb. peekaboo. He warned us that because the meat was aged, the bone would split, so he would--- wait for it---- bring us a frozen ribeye bone with bone marrow for the pup--- wait again--- free of charge!

2013-04-14,3.0,"I'm going to begin by saying that I was very torn as to whether or not to give this place three stars or four, it fell right in the middle for me.   The restaurant is designed like a modern steakhouse with a lot of wood, natural colors, and high back booths that encourage a fair level of intimacy and quiet.  The noise is average in there.  It's currently undergoing renovations to add a much larger bar from what the maître d' was saying.  I'm interested to see what comes of it when it's finished.   The drink selection is very good.  They have a full bar and a good number of wine choices which makes this place ideal for any dry throat.  The one odd thing was how they made my friend's Old Fashioned.  They garnished it with a house made brandy soaked cherry but used just a regular maraschino for the actual drink; it probably would have been much improved with the brandy infused cherry to make the drink and leave the garnish aside.  I had a Manhattan and was sufficiently happy.   The pop over was deliciously airy and was the right balance of flaky and savory.  We had the bacon on a stick which was incredibly good even if it stuck easily to your teeth.  I also had the lobster bisque and was not disappointed.  It was the right balance of sherry, lobster, cream, and the nice twist of apples to make it particularly good.  The starters are what incline me to give David Burke's four stars.   For dinner I had the 55 day aged rib eye.  I've had aged steaks before so I knew what to expect.  It was recommended by the waiter as having the best balance of the full flavor of aged meat as well as the tenderness of regular meat.  However, I found the taste to be rather bland and the meat to be full of fat and gristle.  Don't get me wrong, it was a good steak, just not worth the $60 I paid for it.  My friend enjoyed the Kansas City strip but also felt it was overpriced.   The sides were good but also somewhat underwhelming.  The best were the onion rings with the bacon mustard.  The pierogies were topped by a delicious bacon but were themselves not particularly flavorful.  The mac and cheese was cooked like a carbonara and was nice and creamy but again nothing spectacular.   Finally, I would like to note something about the service.  This place has a great staff and they have plenty of people who are able and willing to help.  However, I felt as though someone was coming by our table to ask how we were doing ever five minutes or so, whether it was the waiter, the manager, the sommelier, the maître d', or someone else.  While it was nice in the beginning, it simply got irritating as time when on because our conversation kept getting interrupted and it seemed as though we were being rushed.   I would certainly go back, but I might try something else on the menu.",0.9987,0.767,0.206,0.027,0.5439045724390552

2013-02-28,5.0,"Okay, I'm not going to lie, it's been a hot minute since I've set foot in Chicago period since moving to the Southwest, HOWEVER the Primehouse is one of those restaurants you just can't forget. I will make a disclaimer, my review is based on my experiences in the 2009-2010 era so the menu is definitely different now. Fun side note: Supposedly all of the beef they serve in house as steaks descends from their key-note stud.... his name is Prime. Sorry, maybe only I find this cool :) Atmosphere: The atmosphere here was pretty trendy even three years ago. Nice open windows, but it was pretty deep set. I get the old boy's club feel here. Just a tip though, the sign wasn't very large for the restaurant and the first time I came here I drove by it multiple times until I finally decided to look up what hotel it was located in (oh blackberry era.....). Regardless pretty good decor. Service: The service was prompt every time I went. Given that it is an extremely reputable steakhouse, I wouldn't expect otherwise. The times I went I remember the waiters always being very accessible and easily flagged down. In case you can't tell, I have the memory of an elephant when it comes to good food experiences so this definitely applies here.  Food: It's all about the beef here. So 40 days of dry aging is a bit too much ""ripeness"" for me. They used to have a 20 day (28 day?!) dry aged filet mignon which was my go-to back in the day. They also had this AMAZING burger. Yes I know I'm harping on about a burger but it was amazing!. It was served pretty much bare of all fixing but it doesn't need any. I also remember getting the Delmonico steak once. It was pretty good, a bit fatty, kind of like a ribeye, but not quite. However everyone else I went with always went with the 40 day ribeye. This is a steak definitely worth calling ahead for if you love dry-aged meat. Like I mentioned, I'm not a fan of too much aging on my meat (or otherwise :p) but I definitely found the steak flavorful and delicious. I believe the ""oldest"" steak my friends and I ventured into was the 55 day ribeye. I don't think we were hardcore enough for the 75 day, BUT now that I'm more into the food scene I think I'll strong-arm someone into ordering it the next time I drop by.  In addition my favorite appetizers were the Kobe beef sashimi (looks like now they have Wagyu beef instead) served on a block of Himalayan rock salt with truffle mayo and shaved truffle skins. I also like the crab cakes. They had this unique pretzel base which I found added great texture to this classic dish. My two favorite sides were the asiago truffle fries and creamed spinach. I have a passion for french fries and the ones here were amazing so definitely try them.  I remember my first visit I tried some random dessert they had on the menu and it was good, but then someone else at the table ordered the signature ""A slice of Prime"" I had pretty hardcore food envy at that moment. From then on, it was always ""A slice of Prime"" for me. It's an incredible chocolate cake that is delicious and decadent. I also love how it comes with this horned chocolate prong-like decoration on top keeping in theme with the emphasis on beef in the restaurant. Overall, this was one of my favorite Chicago restaurants and even now that I live in ultimate steak country I'd say this restaurant still more than holds its own in my book.",0.9993,0.77,0.212,0.018,0.6326416446208113
2013-02-23,5.0,"FAMOUS FOR - Himalayan Salt 40+ Day Dry Aged Bone In Ribeye 100/10 BUZZ - Waygyu Beef Sashimi (9/10) I ALSO TRIED - Bacon Sticks (9/10) So, it was 2006 (freaking 7 years ago!) when I wrote my glowing review of David Burke's. Even though Yelp says it's later, I copied it from my blog post when I joined Yelp, and I only got to paste 1/2 before I ran out of room! The thing is, back in 2006, I had the 40 day dry aged bone in ribeye and I was absolutely blown away! Immediately I told everyone I knew that the best steak in the world was David Burke's! Then I went for my dad's 70th birthday, and they overcooked my steak. :(  Whatever, it's a fluke! So, then later on I went with some friends, and they gave me this one chance to prove my credibility. ALL 6 of our steaks were so salty! Then again I went for Restaurant Week and could only get the Filet, which was eh.  Then FINALLY! Boss decides to entertain some customers, and asks me to pick the spot. I already lost my credibility with my friends, so, here goes my job! I take a chance, and... HOMERUN!  WAYGYU BEEF SASHIMI Today it's Waygyu Beef, it used to be Kobe. It's served on a long slab of Himalayan salt, and it's super super thin slices of, basically, raw beef with small crispy mushroom chips. By itself, and the mushroom chips, it tastes amazing! It's hard to really describe the flavor, but it's more the texture that comes out. The seasoning is perfect too (c'mon! It's sitting on a block of salt!). It comes with truffle mayo, which is good too. It doesn't add any salt (or maybe very little), but makes the flavor more buttery. This is probably my all time favorite appetizer! BACON STICKS These are basically long skewers with what looks like a chunk of pork. It's not a slice of bacon or anything, but it's like a small rectangular cut from a pork chop, but just colored like bacon. It's covered in maple syrup too, so you get the smokey salty flavors mixed with the sweet syrup, and it really is delightful! If you have just one, you'll think you can eat this for your whole life. But when you eat the second one, you'll realize that it would get old real fast. The saltiness of the bacon eventually wins out here, and the more you eat, the more it builds and gets uncomfortable. I only had 2 and realized this was happening. Water never tasted so good! 55 DAY DRY AGED BONE IN RIBEYE The last 3 times I got the ribeye, I go the 40 day. This time, I got the 55 day! OH...MY...GOD! You just can't get perfection like this! Trust me, I've traveled, and I've searched, and I have yet to ever experience a steak like this. Not just taste...experience!  The texture is the first thing. As soon as your teeth hit the char, you can hear and feel the nanometers that your teeth are traveling and what sounds like popping microscopic bubblewrap as you go. Beautiful and delicate crisp on the outside, and then super juicy and moist on the inside. Medium Rare to a perfection! Even without the taste, that exercise in chewing is what I wished every piece of meat felt like. My teeth suck, and I suck at chewing. It takes me forever to eat my food, but this steak is something else! It is so extremely tender, that my f'd up teeth will break all the strands and chew with ease, but it doesn't feel like a wimpy steak that doesn't put up a fight. It still feel just as tough, albeit marbled, as any ribeye steak, but I just don't have to chew an extra 10 seconds or drink wine to wash it down. Thank you salt mine!  Then the flavor. There's a small rosemary garnish on top of the steak. You move it and dismiss it, but then (this is something I noticed a lot more on the 55 day than the 40 day) as you savor the steak, you start to realize that a tiny bit of that rosemary is in the flavor. It seems like an odd combination, but the extremely subtle rosemary flavor really compliments the rest of the steak. By contrasting tastes, it sort of emboldens the seasoning and meaty flavors of the steak. The actual steak itself is seasoned so perfectly. The outer crispy crust provides the initial taste-bud jolt of seasoning, and the juices inside keep that jolt going steadily throughout the bite. Even after the bite's over, the spirit of that bite lingers and seeps into your mind, awakening senses you never knew you had, meanwhile leaving your mouth in a steady state of nostalgia. You know what's crazy? You get to drink a little bit of wine, and repeat that whole ecstatic wave with another bite! It's so right, it feels downright sinful! SALT Before refrigerators, they used salt to preserve their food. I wonder if this is how all food tasted like...damn refrigerators! Anyway, I ended up deleting several appetizers and sides to fit this steak review, because it just needed to get out there, and my last review was an unsuccessful copy/paste job, because the steak part of the review got cut off.

I looked at the reviews and decided David Burke's would be the place to go. We made reservations for 8:00 and off we went. Once at the restaurant we still had a short wait, but nothing major. We grabbed a drink at the bar, which was pretty cramped, but none the less we had a seat. I was disappointed to find they only had two beers on draft. We had a beer and some popcorn with chocolate and Cajun spices on it. It was good, they also brought us some small pretzels in what I think was truffle oil, it was kind of bland and could be messy. Once we had our table the waiter brought over the menu and told us about the three course dinner that they had for the night. It seemed that the three course dinner was the only thing on the menu. What we had was shrimp cocktail to start, then we chose to upgrade our steaks to the 55 day ribeye which was a$47 up charge per meal, then we finished with a desert smaller. It had a chocolate mouse pie, cheese cake lollipop and a small vanilla flavored scoop of ice cream. The main course was severed with mushrooms/onions and parsley mashed potatoes. Everything was good that we ate and the steak was prepared as we had asked. Looking around the interior is nicely decorated. Because of its size it does get a little loud and I would not suggest this place for a romantic dinner for two. As for the waiters I was a little disappointed in the dress attire, I was under the impression that we were going to a dressier place, so we dressed up a bit. Once we got there I noticed all of the servers wearing jeans and a white dress shirt. They were wearing a tie, but most had no tie clip and they looked messy. Looking over the other guest, most were wearing jeans. It made me think that we were in a chain restaurant like Outback Steakhouse or something. Also once we were finished with our dinner, the waiter came over and asked if we would like a tour of the curing room, we thought this would be interesting, so we went on a tour. We went through the kitchen; it was pretty messy and downstairs to the room. It was interesting, but nothing really special. I have a feeling that this is their way of opening up a table for the next guest. We were only at our table for around 45 minutes for dinner. Overall if I were to go back I would have not upgraded my steak, maybe my palate is inferior but I don't think I would have noticed a difference in the aging. I would wear jeans and a nice shirt, but would not be concerned about looking top notch. Our dinner for the two of us was roughly $210 before tip. This included the three course dinner, and one beer and one Crown and Coke. It was a little pricey.   Thanks for reading I hope this helps you in your decision.",0.9848,0.835,0.111,0.054,0.5344130675526024

2013-02-11,5.0,"I hadn't been to a steakhouse in Chicago until the BF and I came to David Burke's on Sunday for an 11am lunch during Restaurant Week.  We (me) had spent a LOT of time going over all of the different Restaurant Weeks menus and when we finally decided on David Burke's, I was worried my excitement would mean high unrealistic expectations.  I certainly had high expectations, but I wasn't disappointed in the least! We arrived at 10:55 and weren't seated until 11:10 - not an issue as we sat on a couch in the bar area and people watched out the window.  The restaurant was fairly empty when we were seated, but was about half full by the time we left.  We sat in a large booth that was comfortable and quiet - we didn't even notice anybody else in the restaurant until a large party of about 15 sat down near us as we were leaving.  A very nice atmosphere all around. The service was also stellar.  They took our coats as we checked in which is a nice touch.  Our waiter was great - he went over the menu with us to ensure we understood the Restaurant Week menu and what they were known for (the aged steaks).  Water and soda refills were speedy and plentiful.  The manager also stopped by our table during our meal to check in on us and ask if there was anything else we needed. And then there was the food ... amazing!!  I started with the Surf & Turf dumplings which came on a beautiful plate with two of each.  The lamb dumplings were definitely the winners here, but I enjoyed both kinds.  The BF got the lobster bisque which was rich but delicious.  There were little chunks of lobster in the bisque and a fried lobster spring roll on the side. I couldn't resist getting the Classic Filet Mignon as my entree.  They call it petite, but it was more than enough for me!  It was cooked perfectly.  It looked a little lonely coming out on the plate all by itself, but that was quickly fixed with the basil infused mashed potatoes and mushrooms that came out in large family style dishes.  The BF got the Aged Burker - he added some of the mushrooms that came on the side to it too.  He was extremely happy with his choice, and readily agreed when the waiter told him it was rated in the top 10 burgers in Chicago. Dessert was a sampler plate of s'mores ice cream, a cheesecake pop, and a chocolate mousse cake with marshmallow topping.  I was expecting one sampler plate to split between us, but we each got our own which ended up being a good thing since everything was SO delicious.  I can't even decide on a favorite. This meal was definitely the only food I ate yesterday as it left me full for a long time.  It was such a good value since it was Restaurant Week - $55 total for all that food and two sodas.  I would be hesitant to return at other times just because of the high costs, but this place is so good it may just be worth it!",0.9987,0.789,0.187,0.024,0.5790866402116402

2013-02-08,3.0,"OK.  It's restaurant week in Chicago.  This restaurant has been on our bucket list, so we gave it a try.  A lot of what was written by previous yelpers is true.  The hostesses are very young  and immature so they are rude.  The manager just needs to give them some training or maybe some more duties throughout the night so they won't have as much time to talk to each other because with the amount of money you spend on a meal, you don't want to feel like the restaurant is doing you a favor.  We ignored the reviews and tried the lobster bisque.  It was very bland and the apples gave it a weird taste.  Our server was great and let us exchange it for the salad which was really good.  Our filets were great.  The mash potatoes tasted like they were cooked with truffle oil There was an odd after taste to them.  The mushrooms were good.  The desserts were good as well.  I would come again during restaurant week, but no way would I spend $300 for 2 people outside of restaurant week.  It was not that good.  I've had better tasting at other steakhouses.  The atmosphere is great.  Our server Nathan was awesome.  He made an assumption that we would want steak sauce, but other than that, everything we asked him for it was provided.",0.9843,0.788,0.165,0.048,0.5526811594202898
2013-02-08,2.0,"Oh, David Burke's. I wanted to love you. It's so near my home I was looking forward to adding another favorite steakhouse to my list during restaurant week. Unfortunately, since I ate there, I have been sick with symptoms I won't even get into here. Let's just say it's lucky I am working from home today. Service was attentive. We had an early reservation during Restaurant Week and were seated promptly.  The server and the guys bussing the table were all on top of their game. The bread and the lobster bisque tasted just fine--nothing I'd crave and be dying to go back to get, but no problems.  I ordered the filet, rare, and that came with the mushrooms and sage mashed potatoes.  The first few bites of the steak were delicious, but then both of us got to the other side, which was a gristly mess. I've literally never had a filet anywhere in my life where I couldn't eat every single bite. Probably 1/5th of this was inedible due to the cut. Anyway, there was plenty to eat so we didn't raise a fuss. Left relatively happy--for the price, it was a decent meal. Again, nothing that would make me bump them to the top of my list when in the mood for steak. Then the problems started when I got home. And continued till the next afternoon. Not sure which dish it might've been--possibly the bisque--but I now have a bad association.

2013-02-08,4.0,"Came here for a girls lunch out during restaurant week 2013.  We made an early reservation at 11, didn't get seated until 11:30, which wasn't really the restaurant's fault, they just wouldn't seat us without all of our party present, but it was fine just people watching while we waited for our last chica to arrive.  Was surprised at how quickly the restaurant filled up on a Friday lunch meeting.  I was suggested to try the dry aged steak burker (burger) and pit it against Father's Office's burger in Los Angeles, so here was my chance! Appetizer: Surf and Turf dumplings These were quite adorable actually and the plating was quite nice.  I tried the lamb dumpling with harissa aioli first, and was pleasantly surprised.  The lamb was flavorful and moist and paired very well with the aioli.  The lobster dumplings were a bit less showy, I think they over did it on the olive oil pairing and the tip where they pinched the dumpling closed was a bit too hard to chew.   It was a bit overly rich, but the concept was nice. Main course: 40 Day Aged Steak Burker Battle on!  Definitely seemed bigger in size than the Father's Office namesake burger in LA, but I realized that it was mainly the bigger bun that made the burker seem bigger.  I liked the shoestring onions and spinach on the burger, and it paired well with bites of the sauteed mushroom side that came with the meal.  I didn't end up putting any ketchup on mine, just so I could really taste the aged flavor.  Aging for 40 days really does concentrate the beef flavor, and definitely added increased umami flavor to the burger.  I would like to try it as an entire steak next time though.  However, since the bun wasn't really all that hot, I still think the FO burger wins the test overall.  Guess I'll just have to go home to get my FO fix. Side dishes: Herbed Mashed Potatoes and Asiago Truffle Fries The herbed mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms came as part of the prixe fixe menu of restaurant week.  I enjoyed the mushrooms and mashed potatoes were a nice touch, but didn't really go with my burger.  Probably would have been better with the salmon entree that my friend ordered.  The herb-infused oil on the mashed potatoes made it very creamy though, and that was delicious.  Truffle fries came in a cute shopping cart basket and was piping hot when it arrived.  The asiago + truffle oil was a decadent topping for the fries, and didn't require any ketchup at all.  I really liked the pairing with my burker.  But trying to eat all of it was a struggle.  SO MUCH FOOD.   Dessert: Chocolate Cake, Cheesecake Pop and S'mores Ice Cream trio My vote is that the S'mores ice cream was the best--it wasn't too sweet and had nice hints of graham cracker and chocolate, though I coudln't quite taste the marshmallow.  I compensated by eat the marshmallow layer off my cake, which turned it into a ganache chocolate sponge cake.  Still good though!  I wasn't too big of a fan of the cheesecake pop, not sure why.  The coating had a funky texture to it, and by that time I was just so full... I'm still full (and I'm writing this review almost 12 hours later!). Next time I will definitely try their aged steak, although it will be pricey.  Just need to be ready for it! :D  Do recommend that you try it out during restaurant week next year!",0.9987,0.788,0.182,0.03,0.4887125220458554

We scored a booth, which I love!!  YAY! Our server was cool, down to earth and attentive.  Explained everything, but didnt push.  We all basically upgraded something, which was great that they allowed that...smart idea. The one thing that I found interesting is that they push these carts all throughout the restaurant to bring the food.  Its a good idea, however, they block the way for people to walk.  It felt like a nintendo game in there at some points trying to go to the washroom.

2013-02-02,3.0,"It was my birthday and I was surprised with a reservation to come here.  I had looked at the menu online a bit ago and thought it would be a great place to try, everything seemed very unique and tasty.  We were sat immediately in a nice over-sized booth and there was a vibrant chatter of other patrons.  We were given a menu and when looking at it I was surprised to see it so limited.  Apparently it was food week and because of that the menu was a customizable 3 course deal.  Or there was another side that had upgradeable items.  Now, when the server went over the menu with us, he said the upgrades were nearly 50% off of regular price, which looked to be true because a $91 steak online was priced at $54. We thought we were in for an excellent meal at a really surprising price. I'll start with the food first and then talk about the pricing.     My disappointment in the limited menu was momentarily saved by the fact that the server said that they are known for their lobster bisque, which I love, and a couple other signature items.  I had to try the bisque and we ended up trying their Wagyu sashimi and the surf & turf dumplings.  The appetizers came very quickly and my first bite was the lamb dumpling, it was excellent!  I then tried the lobster dumpling and was not a fan, could be because it had an overly salty and olivey taste which I'm not fond of.  The Wagyu sashimi came on a salt block with toasted mushrooms and some sort of an sauce and some toast pieces.  The beef was excellent.  Now on to what I was waiting for, the bisque.  Now when a dish has the word lobster in the title, I expect to have actual lobster in it.  There was not one piece of lobster in my bisque.  The soup was thin, flavorless, and severely lacking in flavor.  I only had a few spoonfuls when I had to stop because I couldn't' make myself eat anymore.  We finished our appetizers and the table was cleared, by a very very efficient, friendly staff.  We waited for probably for 15 minutes in between courses, which, in my opinion, is too long.  But, when the main courses came, I was back to being excited about the food.      I ordered the South Side, their version of bone in filet, and it was massive and cooked to perfection.  There was a crust on the outside that intensified the flavor of the meat without overpowering it.  They cooked it to a perfect medium rare.  We also had the king crab legs, which were buttery and warm, and excellent.  The mac and cheese was delicious as well as the brussel sprouts with a bacon and onion marmalade..  Although the side portions were small, we were thankful because with all the meat we were eating, there was no room for a lot of sides.      Now on to dessert.  There was no dessert menu to choose from, which bummed me out because I have a serious sugar tooth.  We were given a trio of desserts on a single plate.  A cheesecake cake pop, a chocolate cake with marshmallow on top, and some sort of an ice cream.  The pop was pretty good but the other dishes were left lacking.      So we finish our desserts and the check comes, I was expecting a good price because of what the menu said.  Nope, everything was charged at full price.  Which seems a little dishonest to me.  In the moment we didn't complain, we are young as it is and didn't need them thinking we were in over our heads.  I'm still deciding if I want to call and ask if there was an error.        In all, I would eat here again.  I might stick solely to cocktails and an entree.  Or make sure I go when the full menu is available.",0.9793,0.856,0.099,0.045,0.5594787851037851

[Note: Dry aged meat as a distinct smell.] I was a little harder to win over after our last experience. We checked in with the host on arrival.  Like the last time, the host was not very friendly but was rather snobby and appeared to be annoyed by us.  Given that a host is your first impression, the host should definitely be friendlier!  Luckily, our waiter was fantastic and even brought a complimentary glass of champagne after we told him of the prior ordeal.  Good start.   We were trying to pick out a wine and our waiter sent over the sommelier.  I didn't find her particularly helpful.  It appeared that she was recommending all really expensive bottles of wine.  In general, I found that there wine list was pricier than some others.

2013-01-17,4.0,"I went here with my fiancee a couple weeks ago to celebrate my new job in Chicago.  We were greeted by a courteous hostess who relieved us of our coats and shopping bags, and we were seated promptly, since we'd arrived before the Saturday night dinner rush.  The ambiance was rustic but elegant, with unique decor.  Generally a cozy but posh vibe. I had the 45 day aged ribeye and she had the bone-in filet, and both were prepared perfectly and lived up to their famous reputations.  The Caesar salad made tableside is the best I have ever had (without the white anchovies)!  I had mixed feelings about the sides we ordered.  The spicy asparagus was fantastic and original, but the truffle asiago fries were disappointingly bland.   The potato and cheese pierogis were subtle with great texture, but were completely overpowered by the small squares of thick-cut bacon littered throughout.  If you like thick, hard to chew bacon with your soft and creamy pierogis then you'll love it, but the differences in texture were too stark for me.  If the chef insists on the salty pork flavor, then I'd recommend prosciutto or pancetta would do the trick without changing the texture. One can be reckless in choosing one's steak here, as every cut of meat is scrumptious and of high quality, but one must take greater care in choosing your vegetables and starches.  Also, be prepared for a hefty bill, particularly if you choose your wine(s) poorly.  However, there are a few wines that are both delectable and reasonably overpriced.  I'll let you find those yourself.",0.9962,0.734,0.225,0.041,0.5837199582027168

Normally sides are ala carte, but our steak came with creamed spinach and mashed potatoes which were fresh and well seasoned.

For appetizer I had the Ahi Tuna Stone.  Presentation was amazing and being able to control how the Tuna is seared was great.  They deliver the tuna searing on a hot stone.  You than flip the Tuna over and allow the other side to sear.  Than dip into a semi-spice sauce and enjoy.  Five Star Appetizer.

My Father had the Lobster Bisque.  They prepare it differently than most with hint of Apple, Pieces of Lobster and a Lobster Spring Roll.  Presentation looked excellent and the apple taste was enjoyable.  Light on the lobster in the soup was the only negative comment.  I won't give a personal rating since I didn't order this but I probably will try it the next time I'm there.

The truffle fries were pretty good, but didn't stand up to the rest of the meal. The real star was the 75 Day Ribeye. I've never had a steak like this before. I always order my steaks rare, because I like them to be tender and juicy, this was tender, but because it was so aged it was not nearly as juicy. However, what it lacked in juiciness, it made up for in flavor. Very strong distinctive taste that  was totally enjoyable. Desert was pretty good, but the real treat was taking a trip down to the basement where they age the meat. It was a great experience and I look forward to returning.",0.9829,0.756,0.21,0.034,0.6423015873015873

While waiting for our table at lunch, the hostess asked if we needed a full menu or if we were going to need the living social deal special. I felt like the way she said it implied that my friend and I wouldn't be able to afford the regular menu. I didn't like the way she said it. Can't say I liked that. Our waiter was ok, except he didn't seem to understand when we told him that our other friend was a vegetarian so he kept asking if she wanted chicken on her caesar salad (which i told her probably has anchovy paste, but didn't know for sure). The woman who made our table side caesar was very nice and friendly. I feel like service overall would've been improved if more of the employees had her attitude. Now for the food. I ordered the caesar with foie gras. That was pretty good. I would've like my foie gras to be of better quality, but it wasn't horrible or anything. Just for $37 for a caesar with about 2oz of foie gras I expected a bit more. On the other hand, the ""wagyu"" sashimi on himalayan pink sea salt was a good deal ($10). The only thing was the first few pieces didn't have flavor. The middle was perfect, and the last pieces were too salty. I also go the lamb on a hot rock. Now THAT was delicious. That was the dish that makes me think they could have 4 stars.

2012-10-16,4.0,"I ended up here for an unexpected fancy date night.  With all the fabulous steak houses in Chicago, I need an element of surprise or something that is signature to leave a lasting impression.  David Burke's did that. It was trendy (loved the decor and mood lighting) without compromising comfort.  I felt like I could relax and be myself, which is nice when you're about to spend a pretty penny on your dinner.  Our waiter was very well informed and seemed to know the menu inside and out.  He also went the extra mile to accommodate my dietary needs.  I wanted to order the surf and turf dumplings: coconut shrimp and lobster with jerk pork & mango.  I didn't want the pork dumplings and they were more than happy to substitute those out and just double the shrimp/lobster dumplings.  The mango dipping sauce had a nice gingery bite that really brought out the sweetness of the shrimp and lobster filling.  I was a fan at first bite.  In keeping with the seafood theme, I also chose the lobster bisque.  The presentation was quite unique.  The server came to the table and poured the bisque onto a medley of green apples at the bottom of the bowl and then set a lobster spring roll on top.  The play on textures and flavors was undeniably scrumptious.  Had I known it was so amazing, I would have requested two orders!   The last thing I chose (because how could I come to a steak house and not try some steak?) were the steak bites served with a chipotle blue cheese.  What was fun about this was that you cooked the steak table side on a hot Himalayan salt stone.  The flavor of the steak was so wonderful that I didn't even want to dip the tiny pieces in the chipotle mayo.  The next time I go, I am going to be sure to order steak, because there is something magical in their dry aging process!  My significant other chose the 55 day dry aged rib-eye and he ate every last bite.  We also ordered the mac and cheese without the bacon and the basil mashed potatoes.  Both were phenomenal and I can honestly say that I have never had basil in my mashed potatoes and am now wondering why more places haven't thought to do it? As if that wasn't enough, we decided that we were going to end the evening on a high note and order the ""cake in a can"": a rich red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting, served in a signature David Burkes aluminum can. When we ordered this at the start of our meal (it takes at least 45 min to make), we NEVER, EVER expected that it would be a cake large enough to feed at least six people OR that it was $24!  It would have been nice for them to mention that on the menu or while ordering.  So, you can only imagine how quickly my jaw dropped to the floor when the cake was finally brought out.  My server pacified me with ""now you have a midnight snack and breakfast for tomorrow.""  Still, it would have been nice to be told that ahead of time.  It's a good thing it was delicious because I was eating that sucker for the next 3 days and still couldn't finish all of it.  Lesson learned boys and girls!  I will always ask before I order anything. To make a long story short, David Burke's was a great time and the food and service (for the most part) really lives up to the high standards set by the other steak houses in the city.",0.9969,0.847,0.129,0.024,0.5667601126472093

Let's take a step back: my grandparents are visiting from China and grew up in a no-frills, Maoist age where on any given day, I still find my grandpappy in his worn tank and shorts, one leg up, throwing back Er Guo Tou/ Mao Tai (Chinese ""vodka"" if you will) snapping and chewing with his mouth open. They say the louder and noisier you eat, the better and more complimenting you are about the food. I was hesitant to book a dinner here, but we were looking for new experiences, so I nabbed the only slot they had available that night for a party of our size. Grandpappy arrived in style, pimpin' in his birthday outfit consisting of a shimmery silk, red brocade shirt. I say this because it caught the eye of David Burke himself. Yes- Burke was IN da house, admiring my grandpa's outfit, asking if he was a chef-- which I suppose the shirt does slightly resemble a chef's top. He ended up taking the kid in our group plus grandpa for a tour of the kitchen. Jelly! Apparently Burke went around to other tables, chatting it up while taking other kids for a tour. Steakhouses aren't usually kid friendly environments and it was great seeing Burke taking the time and effort to make it fun for them.  For a group consisting of a spectrum of ages and preferences, the food appeased us all. From the table side salads, lobster bisque, seafood tower, salt block roasted salmon to the Gresh burger, filet mignons and their infamous dry-aged steaks. We all had tastes of each other's food and they were all great choices.  Who in their right mind would rave about tea when they're at a steakhouse. My grandmother of course. She couldn't help but comment on the sweet fragrance from her jasmine blossom tea. This was the real deal folks, coming from a 70+ year old lady from China. I would have to agree that their selection of teas were so wonderfully expansive.    Dinner was close to a three-hour affair, ending with not just one dessert but two others in following. First came the lovely piece of cake with ""Happy Birthday"" written, next a basket of their kickin' donuts with sauces, then a small plate of dainty sweets (pâte de fruits, marshmallows and macaroons). I highly recommend them all.   I couldn't imagine a better celebration dinner. Mucho props to the staff for being gracious and putting up with us and our dining quirks.

But don't worry -- I ordered the $20 cup instead to experiment with this new kind of tea, but even though it steeped for a long time, I found it flavorless.

So we ordered some drinks at the bar and waited for the rest of our party to arrive.  The drinks here are craft cocktails and super delicious.  I got some drink with pineapple in it.  The boys got some boy drinks, but they were good. We got two orders of crab cakes and a round of lobster bisque soup.  I absolutely loved both.  The lobster bisque had big chunks of lobster and apple in it and a pastry filled with lobster of on top.  Yum.  The crab cakes were more of a roll shape and had pineapple on top... yummm again.  The popovers were really good too.. just like my daddy makes them! And they came in a measuring cup which was super cute. I ordered a fillet mignon, cooked medium and so did the other girl at our table.  All the boys ordered the 55 day aged rib eye since they were sold out of the 75 day aged rib-eye.  The boys were a bit sad by the steaks being sold our but still enjoyed the 55 day version. The only reason I took off a star is because the other girl dining with use got a very under cooked steak.  She sent it back and when it returned it was a new undercooked steak, but she felt bad complaining a second time.  I felt bad for her not being able to fully enjoy her fillet. We also ordered a couple of sides including Bok Choy, mac and cheese, truffle fries and the lobster and scrambled eggs with caviar on top.  All were equally amazing. The cake in the can was literally the icing on top.  They brought out the cake beaters with batter on them for all of us to lick.  Which was a little messy.  I am not going to lie... I had to get my dress dry cleaned after this to get a stain out (yes it came out).  Then they put the icing on the cake at your table right before they serve you.  They give you a slice of the red velvet cake and a scoop of vanilla ice cream... a yummm to end the night!

So I was excited to go there. Both of us had done our homework (yelpwise) and knew what we wanted to order. We started with the goat cheese puffs. Too much goat cheese not enough puff in my opinion, though I appreciated the cute presentation (like a mini roast marshmallow mounted on a skewer.) The beet marmalade was the best part. We then split the ceasar salad prepared tableside. True to the other yelpers statements, the guy who prepared it could have been a little robot and didn't tell us shit about what he was doing, ingredients, etc. You have to pull it out of him. But the salad was yummy. For entree we had the 40 day aged ribeye. He thought it was good. I thought it just tasted too heavily seasoned (super peppery.) I wouldn't pay $49 for it, but I wouldn't pay $49 for any one menu item anywhere. I had the crab cake appetizer. In my opinion this was the best thing we ordered all night. It was fabulous, tons of crab and the mango/plum jam was the perfect accompaniment. The last thing was a quick tour of the meat locker. Um ewww. This was not the perfect end to the perfect night.

The service is excellent and you are treated like a king.  The wait staff has an excellent knowledge of the food and explain it all very well.   The most important thing about this restaurant is that their steaks are dry aged for up to 75 days in a cold room filled with Himalayan salt bricks.  This gives the meat a distinct flavor and it different than your wet aged.  They are delicious and flavor packed.  I highly recommend any of the dry aged ribeyes.  I also recommend the SouthSider filet mignon on the bone.  That hunk of meat is nicely charred on the outside and perfectly pink and juicy on the inside.  Also try the mint snap peas with pearl onions.

2012-09-05,3.0,"The restaurant is rather nice, clean, and for a Friday night was happening place to be. We're seasoned diners in the hospitality world as its part of our profession. The reason we gave David Burke's Primehouse a ""three"", regrettably has a lot to do with it's name and our experience there. If you are a steakhouse you should know one thing very, very well without question... STEAK.  Our party ordered aged steaks based on the waiters recommendations (we always ask what their favorites are). When the food arrived it was overdone (We ordered them med. rare and trust me one of the people in our group was a trained chef, so we do know how they should be prepared). While we just decided to ""role with it"" and not have them re-fired because we were having a great conversation (and the sides were wonderful) the waiter, floor manager, and later the GM all came over to ask about the meal. We advised them of the steaks condition (which we weren't eating), and while they all agreed it was ""overdone"" they all had different thoughts on what ""done-ness"" the steak was. I think I see the problem, the ""done-ness of the meat is very subjective at David Burke's. I suggest being very clear on what you think the ""done-ness"" of your steak is to you when ordering. Don't get me wrong, the staff is great, the experience is wonderful, and if you aren't up on all the culinary details or observant you would likely give this restaurant a 4-1/2 star rating on Yelp.  The other turn off which could have been a great plus to the restaurant is the ""signature Cesar Salad"" made table side. They wheel out a little cart, all the ingredients are laid out, pretty impressive... then it goes downhill. The salad ""prep person"" does not talk to you, there is no explanation of what he is doing, what ingredients are going in. ""Do you like it a little salty? Anchovies, they're fresh, and are from xxx""? Nothing, no dialog, we even try and ask, he ""has no idea"". Nor does he act like he wants to be there, we ask questions, try to engage him... he grunts. It's only then that we started looking at the ingredients laid out on the cart. The eggs are seriously ""Egg Lands Best"" coming out of a Styrofoam carton and into the salad, other food items are in Ziploc bags, and the spoons are plastic picnic ware. This ""great"" experience just seemed cheap, and the meal there was about $300 per couple... for that you kind of wanted a ""show"" for this ""signature table side event"" -right? We felt kind of cheated; this was not the fine(er) dining experience that we thought it would be for the price we were paying. One last comment on our experience. To make up for the ""steak experience"" the comp'd us the ""chefs famous desert"", unfortunately the pastry chef forgot to take the baking paper off the bottom of the desert. Baked in, it passed unseen and everyone wound up with a mouth full of paper which really detracted from the (free) desert.

We opted for the table side caesar, which wasn't our first, but definitely the best.  Very fresh and delicious.  It adds to the experience.  We both went with steak, which was hands down, some of the best meat that has ever melted in our mouths.  We didn't even have room for dessert after that.  Instead, we chose after dinner drinks.  They were made perfectly.  So perfect (and strong), that it prompted us to ask for a personal tour of the himalayan salt blocked meat locker on a whim.  A Manager came over and took us through the back of the restaurant to meat heaven.  She took our picture and we just stayed in there for a few minutes to view all of the different aged cuts of beef.  It was a really cool experience.  I am sure that after this review, there may be an influx of patrons requesting this.  Sorry David Burke.

The atmosphere and decor is elegant and our server was extremely knowledgable about the menu. However, most of the good things end there. We felt rushed throughout the entire dinner to get our orders in and get out. There was no down time between items coming out -- which sometimes is a good thing at a place like a Applebees -- but this is the kind of place you take your time!  The food was just mediocre. Appetizer (kobe corn dogs) were small and greasy. My husbands steak was covered in fat and my Greshburger had only one tiny slice of prime rib on top and was very dry. Also, I asked if an appetizer could be turned in to a side dish for my meal... Our waitress went to the kitchen to check and said yes, however I was still charged for the entire appetizer price.

2012-08-07,5.0,"While spending a couple months in and out of Chicago on business I ended up staying at the James (where this restaurant is located) about a couple times a week for an entire month.  Consequently I can speak to the food on all levels (ordering room service, at the bar, to go, and sitting at a table in the place itself). Perhaps I shouldn't have eaten here so much since there was so much amazing food to be had within Chicago but alas, I couldn't resist the convenience.  Room service... if you're staying at the James, I think this may well have been the best or second best room service ever... and I travel a lot! Quick, prompt, and friendly service, it definitely lives up the reputation of the James itself.  The bar... Ok so this is kind of fun but a co-worker and I ended up at the bar to wrap some work we still needed to finish for the week and deliver to a client. We ordered food and drinks.  She, my boss no less, got sloshed! And then super excited to run into some of the designers from Project Runway. (Yes you read that right. She's a huge fan.) They eventually came over and sat down with us and we spent the rest of the evening chatting away.  Food and drinks were excellent as well.  To go... Work sadly moved me over to the Holiday Inn later in the contract but I enjoyed DBP so much I decided to grab food to go and take it back to my hotel. They got the order right, thankfully, but all I can recall is that I was curious about the donuts and so ordered that with the meal. They come with syringe like ""toppings"" that you can ""squirt"" onto the donuts. It was different and in the end I found myself on the fence about the over all experience. Service good.  Dinner good but desert was lacking.  Finally, eating in... I need to divide this up from dinner and brunch because each are their own separate experiences.  Dinner...  I can only vaguely recall that I had steak and it was simply divine. IN fact it was the first meal I had had there after a particularly long week down in Bloomington so the fact that the meal hit home and the service was good was enough to keep me coming back.  Brunch, however, this place has been by far the most creative brunch I've ever had. YOU MUST TRY THE BENTO BOXES! Enough said.  No, really.  I had the egg bento with scrambled eggs and lobster which surprised me as to how good that was. Seemed like a weird combination but it melds together and tastes delicious. I went back and tried the griddle box with berry french toast and blueberry pancakes. The last one I tried was with the sliders and mac and cheese.  Loved the sliders but the mac and cheese didn't do it for me, at all. Just didn't seem to have any flavor. It was sad given how many people had told me it was ""amazing"".  To each their own, I guess.  The fresh juice drinks are also great for the morning pick me up.  The atmosphere is comfortable upscale.  In that if you walked in in jeans you'd probably be just as comfortable as someone in a suit. The service has always been fantastic.

2012-08-07,3.0,"Oh, David Burke's. There are so many things I really, really enjoy about this restaurant. It would definitely be a solid 4 stars had it not been for a less-than-stellar experience I had with a credit card snafu. First, the awesome: I come to Chicago pretty often for work. David Burke's was highly recommended to me by a friend, and I've since come back more than once. With all the dining options available in Chicago, the fact that I craved coming here again says a lot. It's old-school Chicago steakhouse with some modern flair. The story of the chef, with his own bull and line of beef, is interesting. The pink Himalayan sea salt appointments, and tales of their pink-salt-tiled aging room makes this place feel like something special and new. The menu is eclectic and varied, without being unwieldy. For example, the appetizers are exceedingly interesting and unique, yet the main meat menu remains fairly classic. Everything is good, from apps to meaty ribeye, to dessert. Instead of a lameo bread basket, you receive a Parmesan (?) popover served in a measuring cup. There's quite a few featured items ""performed"" table side, like the dramatic Caesar, or the frosted chocolate cake (served in a tin, so you can take it home and guiltily stuff it in your face in the middle of the night). This is high-end comfort food, for sure. Anyway. All that is great. My colleague and I split our bill. I noticed my card came back with the full amount on it. No worries, it happens. The waiter voided the earlier transaction, charged the correct amount, and assured me my credit card bill would reflect the accurate charges the very next day. This kind of thing happens, so I wasn't really concerned. However, the next day the charge was NOT removed. Actually, a different amount was listed, which worried me-- I was concerned my card had again been swiped incorrectly. I am in NO WAY saying that David Burke's purposefully mis-charged my credit card. These things happen all the time,  but there were some red flags that made me think the originally voided charge was not the charge I was dealing with. I called the manager to discuss the charge the next day. He seemed to genuinely wish to help, but we'd run out of business hours to deal with the accounting department. He felt certain the card would be rectified by morning, anyway. Well, it wasn't. I spent the next day trying to communicate with management (a different manager this time), who had no knowledge of the matter, and I had to start all over again with explaining the issue. Again, the next day the card did not reflect the correct amount.  It wasn't until 3 days later that my card reflected the correct amount. This was a huge inconvenience for me, as I travel with a low-limit credit card for expenses (on purpose). The David Burke experience is great, and comes with a hefty price tag. Tying up such a large amount for that many days was unacceptable.  While I felt like the management addressed my concerns politely and professionally when they were directly interacting with me, I didn't feel like they were doing all they could do behind the scenes (like the issue slipping through the cracks from one day to the next). It felt a little disrespectful that they weren't doing all they could to free up the funds applied in error, so I might have access to my own resources.

About the only thing people agreed on was that we'd pay a pretty penny for the experience. To be honest, having just recently emerged from my beef coma, I can only say that our experience was very positive.  DBPH has the two things you look for in a high-end dinner splurge, service and food. Service was brilliant - attentive and informed without being intrusive. I had done some homework and knew what I wanted - wagyu sashimi appetizer, 55-day ribeye & glass of Zuccardi Q Malbec - and did not feel pressured to add/sub/mod my order to further engorge the bottom line. The wife took a ""wait and see"" approach; the wine suggested by the sommelier (pinot noir) was much enjoyed, as was the special suggested by our waiter - 40-day, bourbon-aged ribeye. A special ""shout out"" to the valet staff for taking good care of the wife's truck, and having it ready & waiting as we exited. Of course, great service cannot rescue bad food, and in that regards the steaks were top notch. Being from Texas, I'd like to think we know a thing or two about beef, and these were some of the best steaks I can recall having had.  It motivated me to bring home a few dry-aged steaks from the on-site butcher shop (out there is one lucky terrier, who has a date with 40-day, dry-aged hamburger for her upcoming birthday). The 55-day ribeye was intensely beefy, with a nice char on it, cooked to what looked like a perfect medium rare (it was dark, so I have to admit, I gave it the poke test!).

As for my mom, she ordered the mixed green salad (it was fine, but nothing special) and the Vegas strip steak, which was really talked up on the menu.  It was good, but again I did not think it was anything special, and also I feel certain parts of it were unevenly cooked because of the varying thickness of the meat.  She ordered the truffle asiago fries, which definitely could have been better.  Soggy fries are a crime in my book! Overall, the meal was very good and my mom and I both left feeling very satisfied.  It even came with a martini, which we were allowed to substitute for a glass of wine since my mom and I don't drink martinis.  The service was excellent, and I would definitely suggest coming here for a very nice but inexpensive lunch.  At only $20, it's hard to go wrong!",0.9966,0.701,0.258,0.041,0.5680631437527988

I'm the type of guy that can easily rattle off my top 5 steaks of all time, and the 55 day aged Ribeye at DB's is now proudly near the top of that list. Yes it's expensive. Order it anyways. In lieu of traditional bread, you'll get some tasty popovers served in the baking vessel, an old-style metal measuring cup. The caesar salad may not *quite* live up to the hype, but its absolutely good enough to be worth ordering nevertheless, and the tableside presentation is a nice touch. For sides we had the mushrooms (good), creamed spinach (great), and truffle fries (just ok--the version at MK are far superior in my opinion). The service was definitely good though less buttoned-up than you'd expect from a place where the bill for 4 neared $500. I'm also not the biggest fan of the decor; yes it is in the James Hotel, but it truly did feel a bit like a sterile hotel restaurant, despite having food that far surpasses these somewhat bland surroundings. Contrary to what I'd read, I didn't find the seating to be terribly crammed--nothing like you'll find at your typical BYO sushi joint.

We sent it back to the grill to bring it up to a med-rare, this rescued the dish.  It was a good steak, but I still was not impressed and it was way overpriced. The beef sashimi was salty, too salty.

The cheapest steak was their petite filet mignon which was $45. You could hear the collective groan and realization that this wasn't a cheap place. Booo @ my boss for that. We revoked his food choosing priviledges. The ambiance is really nice, but a tad on the loud side. I'm not a fan of having to shout across the table to my co-worker because they can't hear me.

2012-06-03,1.0,"Came here last night, and had one of the worst dinners I have ever paid for.  This review has nothing to do with the service, as our waiter and the management were all fine.  I believe the issue may have been the kitchen staff last night. The reason I say this, is because upon asking about specials I was told there weren't any tonight as the kitchen was ""understaffed"" this particular evening.  I believe they may have asked some of the hotel front desk staff to cook as the chefs weren't coming in. So we got the kobe corn dogs and some oysters for appetizers.  The oysters were good, and the kobe dogs were ok as well.  So far not to bad.  Then came the entree's.  I got an aged steak, and my gf got the caesar salad with chicken.  Apparently the restaurant is ""famous"" for the salad made table side, but in all honesty it is extremely bland.  The chicken was a joke as an addition, super dry and flavorless.  Needless to say that was terrible.. Now for the steak! Bad..  First off the steak came out just on a huge plate with smudges all over it, no nothing.  It reminded me of the steak in the movie napoleon dynamite.  For $50+ I thought it would at least be presented well.  Tons of fat, decent flavor in the meat and was cooked fine though.  Super disappointing.  Also we had ordered some sides as they sounded pretty good, and the server told us ""these were his favorite"" so we were looking forward to them.  The sides were the asparagus and truffle fries.  The asparagus had a weird sauce that tasted like somebody mixed soy sauce and vinegar and bathed the stalks in it.  Really horrible.  The fries were super soggy as if they were delivered from somewhere else in a tied up plastic sack and poured into a container. Just more disappointment.   When I got the steak, I was really wanting a nice glass of wine to go with it, so i ordered the RRV Pinot.  Problem was that the server poured it in a glass that already had a drink in it.  I immediately said something, and he apologized and promised to bring me more to top off what he had left for me.  Never happened, and I was still charged for it.   I know the manager tried to make up for our horrible evening, but I don't give better reviews because you were apologetic.  I honestly would have rather eaten take out chinese and saved $100+.  I'm still kicking myself for choosing to have a celebratory dinner at this establishment.",0.9905,0.772,0.156,0.072,0.6296296296296297

The other meal was the standard dry aged steak they do so well.  I tried 3 separate versions of the steak and I still can't determine which was the best.  Any of the steaks you get here will be cooked to perfection with a fantastic flavor.   If you ever have the chance to go here you should; great food and service at every turn.",0.9929,0.783,0.205,0.012,0.5215000000000001

2012-04-25,5.0,"I love my life! My wife took me here because of the Yelpers talking about the lunch deal.  It is called ShakenSteak...at first I thought... Great!!! a burger, fries and shake!  Then I realized I was a choice of a vodka or gin martini, a 6oz Fillet or Salmon or Steak salad with a choice of side: asiago fries, spicy asparagus, mashed potatoes or mushrooms/onions!  What an amazing deal for only $15.99 for lunch!  We both went with the fillet medium rare, asiago fries and vodka martinis with blue cheese olives.  You could also upgrade your steak for a nominal fee (starting at $8)! Again another deal. They also offered 4 apps for only $5. How could we resist?  We went with the wedge salad to start.  As we were sitting we were delivered some asiago cheese pop-ups!  It was similar to the Brazilian buns but more airy and hallow in a tiny metal 1 cup serving dish. Plus the butter was served on tiny piece of wood and it was perfectly soft.  I hate other restaurants with there frozen butter.   Next came the wedge salad and it was really good but very unique and different. The first thing I noticed was the red dressing on the bottom of the plate.  I tasted it and it was spicy but good.  In fact it all worked together. Our waitress did not explain it to us that it might be spicy. She is lucky we like spicy.  In fact our waitress was the worse part of our meal. She seemed to not like us from the moment we down.  Tim the manager sat us and he was amazing. In fact, we spent about 5 minutes talking about steak and the aging process.  This was one of the best managers I've ever met.  I love customer service and he delivered above and beyond.   As we waited for our steak Steve another waiter stopped by and we spoke with him. In fact, Steve visited us and spoke with us almost 3 times. I finally asked if he was our new waiter.  He said, ""No...she was busy in the back!"" I really don't want to call her out but it was odd she never told us she was leaving us. Personally Steve should have been our waiter and I wish he would have gotten the tip. He really seemed to care about us.  Our steaks finally arrived and they were perfectly cooked-medium rare and there was so much flavor in every bite. I now have a new favorite steak place.  The only thing I didn't like was the asiago fries...they didn't seem fresh...in fact they had been broiled to melt the cheese and it made them a little limp and soggy.  But I'm not going to let that ruin lunch because the steak was amazing.   We also met Milo, a new manager, he had only been here 3 days and this was his second visit to our table.  Again no sign of our original waitress.  In fact, Tim the manager who sat us asked if we wanted a private tour of the aging process in the basement. Are you kidding me? YES!!!  I even had to go and feed the meter so we had another hour.   As we were drinking we found out we could add on a second martini for $5.  Really?  Are you trying to keep me here forever? I may never ever leave!!! Our waitress returned and I said, ""Are you okay? I thought you were never coming back!"" She informed us that she was having lunch and had been working since 7am.  That's fine but I wish she would have told us that she was stepping away from us and Steve would be taking care of us. This was the one blemish on our lunch experience.   Tim arrived for our tour and we were able to take our drinks with us. Bonus!!! Milo also joined us too...we felt so special.  Thanks again for giving us such an amazing experience.  As we entered the den of meat we were told to take a deep breath before we entered.  That first breath inside the cooler was incredible.  There was a wall of Himalayan salt that the cool air blew over that helped with the aging process. The wall was a beautiful brown tan off white color. The steaks were tagged and aged accordingly.  What amazed me is that you could get a steak that was aged for 75 days.  That is unheard of.  We actually saw them all waiting just waiting to be served.  What I found amazing was that the first cut of beef they ever had is still in there. Almost 6 years and one month old and still aging. How cool is that? I suggested we get a knife and taste it.  We all laughed.  I suggested it might be the best beef jerky ever.   We also learned that chef Rick is experimental.  He was aging cheese and duck in old bourbon barrels too (which he got from Goose Island). We even had a chance to meet the chef. He was cooking polenta on a brick of Himalayan salt.  It looked amazing.  In fact, there was a photographer there taking photos for an upcoming cookbook for Chef Rick.  We felt a little like rock stars or potential investors.  How did our simple lunch turn into two hours of a dream lunch experience!!! I must thank Tim , Steve, Milo and Chef Rick for giving us the experience of a lifetime. I'm a Chicago boy and loyal to my local steak places but I must say, ""You are on my steak list now...if fact you knocked an old favorite off!""",0.9994,0.801,0.172,0.027,0.5106232964566298

2012-04-16,5.0,"I don't often patronize steakhouses; I find them played out and stuffy. David Burke's, on the other hand, is neither, and can play with the big boys of Chicago fine dining. . The space is very warm and inviting, and the service is exceptional and frank without a whiff of snobbery (our waiter described the 55-day ribeye as tasting ""like movie theater butter"" - perhaps not appetizing for some people, but in my book, very refreshing for fine dining service). Appetizers are more unique amuse-bouches than anything;  the bacon (served as lollipops) and the wagyu sashimi (served on Himalayan rock salt) are pleasant, but perhaps superfluous. The tableside-tossed Caesar salad is definitely the best version of this classic I've had anywhere, redolent with garlic and anchovy flavor but by no means overdressed. This was probably my personal highlight of the evening. Steaks are all fantastic; 35 day aged New York strip is flavorful, meaty, and cooked impeccably to order, and the 55-day ribeye is just in its own stratosphere; it tastes nothing like what I conceive of as beef, with a completely different profile. It's steak-ier than anything I could have ever imagined. Side dishes are far from the scalloped potatoes and creamed spinach one comes to expect from steakhouses; tempura green beans are fried to a light crisp, and truffle fries actually taste like truffles (I'm pretty sure this is the only version of this now-ubiquitous dish in Chicago that manages to taste like itself). For dessert, we went with the red velvet cake in a can, a perfectly decadent nightcap to the decadent experience David Burke's offers. Pricing is obviously very steep; there's no way I could eat here not on someone else's dime. Still, it's a very worthy splurge.

I ordered a medium rare 55 day aged bone-in Ribeye as recommended by most reviewers and our waiter. Unfortunately I did not enjoy it as much as I expected. It was chewy for 55 days of aging, and did not have the intensity of flavor I had hoped for. While dry aged steaks are typically thought to be a superior aging process, this reviewer has decided I like a much juicier steak.  For dessert our waiter brought a sampling of chocolate lollipops, and the blood orange coconut dessert.  The lollipops were good, but the blood orange coconut was divine.  I enjoyed this dessert immensely.

2012-04-04,5.0,"I got to hand it down to David Burke. I have to say this was one of the best ribeye I've had in a while. From the beginning... We began the course with the Wagyu Kobe beef sashimi. The presentation, the taste was superb. The only flaw was the quantity (LOL). It's a bit hard to pick at it due to the dryness of it but it was worth the try if you have the patience to craft one with all the ingredients provided. We then got bread pudding which was amazing; I'd suggest you each it all as its out the oven hot fresh. If you left it to be like me to compliment the steak.. then you would have had wasted the bread as it hardens and didn't have the same rich flavor it had served fresh and hot.  After that we got the main course. I had the 75 days dry age ribeye with a glass of Shiraz to compliment with it which was recommended by our waiter, whom was excellent to ensuring our experience was one to remember. The $66 steak was indeed awesome, however only after the 2nd piece I got. The first one I received cooked well done and the waiter noticed I was not satisfied when he walked by and saw a sour face. I think you would have a sour face if you're eating $66 of bad steak. But to be honest, I didn't even know how a 75 day aged steak would taste so I of course asked him first how it was suppose to taste like.. he didn't hesitate and took the plate away and immediately had another piece cooked for me. WIthin 5 minutes, the manager presented a brand new piece and requested that I sliced to the center to ensure it was to my satisfactory of medium rare. Being a noob to dry-aged steaks, I immediately knew that this was the real authentic steak cooked to medium rare.  The sides were more than enough feed us. In fact for 2... one side was enough!

The cocktail I had before dinner was also bad - which is shocking!  No garnish whatsoever in a drink that always has a charry and orange slice and the propotions were off.  The husband ordered a wedge salad and asked if he could get it without onion.  The waitress said yes, but apparently he needed to say ""Simon says no onion"" because it came out with full-on onion.  And, then the server asked if he wanted pepper and he clearly said ""no"",  but he ground away.  I told him it must be opposite night.

WOMP. make sure to call ahead if this is what you want to do, and they can try to put one aside from you. an insider tip i wish i had known.) they sliced it at the table for us, cooked it perfectly, and now, i dream of those steaks...and my mouth is watering thinking about them. and it's 945 am. we checked in on foursquare and got a free appetizer (shrimp & lobster dumplings..meh), and also ordered the kobe beef sashimi.

2012-03-05,3.0,"After a pleasant steak experience during restaurant week 2011, I decided to make another reservation for this year's restaurant week. Came with a colleague during lunch and was promptly seated even though we were 15 min late for our reservation. We started out with a flavorful lobster bisque with robust flavors, brightened by pieces of green apple. The lobster spring roll could be crispier, but I thought it was a good start. Unfortunately, this time I committed the cardinal sin of steakhouse dining by not ordering a steak. Instead, I fell for the temptations of the ""40 day aged burger"". Despite ordering my burger medium, when it arrived it was completely cooked and not a drop of juice was to be found. Having still not perfected the art of sending my food back, I ate it begrudgingly without complaining. The small-bite desserts that followed lifted my spirits slightly. They're still pretty rich (which seems to be standard for steakhouses), but I like how you get a taste of different desserts instead of a palate-numbing giant dessert most steakhouses offer. Fast forward to the end of the meal, the manager stopped by each table to chat with the diners, and my disappointment in the burger must have been obvious, as he inquired further what was wrong with our experience. He immediately offered to bring another one but I was too full to accept it. Imagine my surprise when I received the bill and found out he had comped my meal! They definitely get an A+ for service, and next time I'll remember to pipe up early so they can fix it before I eat. Then again, next time I'll probably just stick with steak.",0.9101,0.801,0.125,0.074,0.5013333333333334
2012-03-05,2.0,"When five of six arrive and wish to be seated, it's very Bennigan's to refuse to seat us until everyone is present without so much as offering a seat at the bar or some other accommodation. This was not restaurant week; patrons should not be forced to wait in front of the revolving door while empty tables await. Entertainment value, thanks to the hostess, was unmatched. I mistakenly identified her as an escort, assuming she was just another arm-candy prop brought in by a New Religion-clad ex-soccer Dad running the River North express to tackytown. In a skin-tight leopard print dress that barely covered her butt, I felt like I should be holding singles up in the air throughout dinner. I know, I know: hate the player, not the game. We didn't get off on the right foot at all, though our server was top-notch; etiquette and courtesy all five-star. Food is largely overrated. I like my steaks rare, and a good cut should not be as tough as mine was, even when cooked rare which often does not afford the meat's connective tissue enough heat or time to break down. I've had better steaks that cost more, and less. I'd say the 55-day I had was a perfectly mediocre $40 cut, not $60-plus.  Other diners at the table had fillets that looked delicious; there were plenty of clean plates and take-home containers.  Appetizer bacon ""lollypops"" were alright. Presentation value trumped flavor; I had one and had no desire to go back for more. The mini corn dogs seemed to go over well, but I opted out; you can call anything you want ""Kobe beef"" but a hotdog is still a hotdog. The Kobe beef sashimi served on a brick of salt was really good and went super-fast. It's sort of like the ""Rock"" at Japonais, minus the self-service cooking. Sides were largely forgettable: soggy fries with Heinz's fanciest, onion ring tower for twice the price and with half the deliverables as Red Robin, two -- maybe three -- pieces of asparagus in a delightfully spicy sauce. The only true stand-out was the potato pancake. Alas, sour cream and bacon makes anything better. Desserts were fantastic. Cheesecake pops on a tree-like stand were spot-on, and the donuts were delicious; reminiscent of Moto with the self-fill squeeze jars. Fun. Burke's is a solid 4-star joint if someone you don't like is footing the bill - 2-3 stars if you or someone you care about is going to get saddled with the check.",0.9957,0.792,0.174,0.034,0.501653038319705
2012-03-05,5.0,"The first time I came here, I thought it was too good to be true, so I waited until multiple visits have backed up my initial impression. To me (and steak is serious business in my house!) this is the best steak place in Chicago. Yes, I know what that means.  Yes, I've been to most of them multiple times.  I've been to the best in NY and other major cities.  But given a choice, I'd pick David Burke's over all of them. First, the steak itself blows you away.  I love me some ribeye.  I've had both the 55 and 75 day aged ribeyes at Burke's, and they are two of the best steaks in existence IMO.  I've never had a steak more flavorful than their 75 day ribeye.  They cook it right every time, the perfect (minimal) seasoning so that huge beef flavor comes through.  It's pure beefy awesomeness.  Second, David Burke's does everything else better than the other steakhouses by even a greater differential than how much better their steak is than the others.  While their steak is head and shoulders above the other top steak places, their appetizers, desserts, and sides are in an entirely different league.  I'm a steak guy, but I'm also a self proclaimed foodie.  I like seeing creativity, unique ingredients, and awesome fusion of flavor, and David Burke's does that too.  Yeah some typical apps like calamari, scallops, or the like are great.  But how about shrimp and lobster dumplings with jerk pork and mango?  Or the best app on the planet, wagyu beef sashimi served on a Himalayan salt block with mushroom chips and truffle mayo?  Sure some grilled asparagus and a baked potato is great with a steak.  But truffle asiago fries and tempura green beans are so much better!  And though I'm not a dessert guy, the kickin doughnuts and carrot cake are superb. Finally, to top it off, the service and staff are great.  Once we were there for an early dinner.  Someone came out of the kitchen shortly after we were seated with a small plate of appetizers.  But we hadn't ordered anything yet.........the chef was trying some new stuff in the kitchen and wanted to get some customer feedback, so he sent us a free plate to sample!  On our anniversary they sent us a free piece of cake with ""Happy Anniversary"" drizzled on it.  The other day we were there for their famous brunch, which we'd always wanted to try since we love dinner there so much.   I spy the blurb about all the dinner steaks being available for breakfast too.  I'm torn.  Since Burke's is a pricey, special occasion place for us, I don't want to pass up an opportunity for one of their steaks, but I also wanted some breakfast food.  So I ask the waitress ""What if I want your 75 day dry aged ribeye from the dinner menu, but I want a load of breakfast food with it instead of the dinner sides."" Her response was PERFECT: ""You can absolutely do that. At David Burke's we will make you whatever you want, no matter what's on the menu, assuming we have the ingredients."" Bam, I'm in instant heaven.  I apologize if this read half like an advertisement, but I was really just trying to do David Burke's justice.  I love all of the great food options in Chicago.  I'm just as comfortable in a dive eating a really great $8 lunch as I am at some of the world class places Chicago has to offer.  But if you made me pick one single place as my favorite, I'd have to say it's David Burke's.  Can't recommend it enough.",0.9993,0.739,0.228,0.032,0.5384722476271773

She: wedge salad + pan roasted salmon + dessert trio (we didn't get an option for dessert) Him: surf + turf dumplings + filet mignon + dessert trio After ordering, we were quickly brought out two hot cheese popovers, bulging out of their metal 1-Cup measuring vessels.  What a creative take on starter bread!  Interesting looking/presentation, and pretty damn good.   Our starters were out shortly after the bread arrived.  The dumplings included 2 ""surf"" + 2 ""turf"" - I don't recall the specifics, but he enjoyed them.  The wedge was great too.  Most wedge salads come with bacon, but this one did not, which, while I wasn't missing the bacon, I did wish it had some crunchy element - nuts, toasted croutons - some kind of crunch.  Still - very good salad, interesting spicy tomato vinaigrette + plenty of cheese.  So far, so good!  *Back to my 'almost too fast' comment:  Entrees arrived when I was a little past the 1/2 way point on my salad, and the server just kind of stood there awkwardly with the plates, offering to take them back to the kitchen until I was finished.  I told him it was fine, and said since he was already at the table, to just leave them.  This didn't upset me, but I thought they could have timed it better, and waited until both starter plates were cleared before bringing the entrees out.   The salmon was cooked perfectly - with a nice, creamy caper sauce.  The steak also went over well.  Entrees included two sides for the table to share: mashed potatoes + marinated mushrooms with shallots.  Everything was hot and delicious.   The dessert trio was probably my favorite part.  We ordered coffee to go with the trio, and savored a nice little sampling of a decadent chocolate cake topped with a layer of marsmallow (my fave), a cheesecake lollipop with white raspberry whipped cream (his fave), and a dollop of housemade vanilla ice cream.   I'd go back to Primehouse because I enjoyed all the food and the service was lightening fast, but in my quest to find my favorite / THE best Chicago steakhouse, I must continue on to other steak establishments before returning back...",0.9986,0.766,0.208,0.026,0.58437106918239

To be fair, I did find their lobster bisque and lboster roll to be very, very good though. And dessert didn't disappoint either. I should also point out that our party was over-charged for our meal.

Ambiance is nice and non-pretentious, with plenty of comfortable booth seating and space between tables. Seems like a great place to take the family. Primehouse serves complimentary popover bread to start. The Lobster Bisque soup was large and very good. The dumplings, though small, were also very good (4 pieces total). We spotted the salad wedge on other tables and serving size is large. The classic filet, although good, was not quite to my expectations. I thought we'd see something more creative from this caliber of restaurant. However, I really can't fault them much; maybe it was what Primehouse was going for with ""classic"" (plain). The other side of me thinks maybe I didn't get the best cut of filet. Oh well, the steak does come with a massive side of mushrooms and mashed potatoes. Sharing sizes! And the salmon was a hit with the girlfriend. There is only one option for dessert on the RW menu and it really wasn't my style but was okay nonetheless.

However, to put my praise for the burger and its mayo in context, I should say I went for restaurant week with the gf. We both enjoyed our meals. First of all, the staff, at least when we dined, did not give off that snooty ""we know you're only here for restaurant week"" vibe, I've felt at other places in the past. As for the other courses, they packed the flavor and execution I would expect from a place like David Burke's. The lobster bisque, albeit a little heavy, had plenty of lobster and was full on flavor. The lobster spring-roll served with it was fantastic. The entree as you can already see was high on my list. Dessert was a high-point too. The cake with toasted marshmallow topping was clever and not too sweet. The cheesecake lollipop with raspberry whipped cream was a perfect marriage of tart and creamy. The burnt sugar ice cream was a little icey. Admittedly, I didn't get the burnt sugar taste at first, but when I hit the less icy center and tasted it properly, it wound up being my favorite of the three desserts.

The chocolate cake was a bit dry and I'm not a fan of marshmallow. Overall... Meh.

To be fair, this review is two months late, but I've eaten here more than once and it rarely changes. In fact, the consistency is one of the things I like about this restaurant. First, expect that your reservations may not be on time. Yeah, it has happened to us, but we don't mind. We enjoy each others company and Primehouse has a nice bar/lounge area attached that we enjoy having drinks in while we warm up before dinner. The restaurant is modern, tasteful and elegant. It isn't one of those noisy places where you can't hear yourself think, but it also isn't one of those stuff places where you cant relax. In Goldilock's world, this place would be"" just right"". For appetizers, we usually enjoy the Scallops. They don't over or under cook them here. (Sensing the Goldilocks theme to this review?) They are served on a grain, but I can't remember it, so it can't have been a memorable grain. Hubby also likes the Tuna Tartare. That's raw fish, so not something everyone enjoys. But it is well presented and tasty. I will often have a bite, though the complete app is more raw tuna than I like to eat. I actually prefer the King Crab appetizer. It's cooked and tasty. The real reason you come here, the star of this show is the steak. If you're a veggie eater, please don't bother. This place is about the meat. And, oh, what glorious meat! I like the Filet Mignon. Cooked medium rare this puppy is a thing of beauty. Warm all the way through and beautifully pink without the running bloodiness. Perfectly yummy. My hubby prefers the 55-day dry aged rib eye. That's right they keep that hunk o' meat in a Himalayan pink salt cellar for 55 whole days! Then they trim it and cook it to perfection. He gets his medium rare, too. It's so perfectly tender that the meat just seems to melt in your mouth. I like this steak, I've tried his. But this steak has a bone in it and hate my meat with bones in eat. I like the Filet because it is easier to cut and eat. At least, that's how I feel. You have to order the sides separately. But the potato pancakes with bacon and cheese are worth ordering. Hubby, though, likes their mac-n-cheese. But be warned it's made with blue cheese. Not for the kids! We've never had their desserts because we always order the cheese plate for dessert. It's a good way to finish the meal. Now, the disclaimer. Goldilocks needs to be prepared to pay for her pleasure here.

2012-02-20,5.0,"Just like the young lady stated, writing a review about my experience at David Burke's Primehouse will not truly capture the experience. My wife and I initially decided to have an expensive steak dinner on Sunday on our long MLK weekend trip to Chicago. During the day Saturday we decided to go that night; needless to say finding a reservation was an extremely difficult task. After weeks of reading reviews prior to our trip we narrowed it down to the three final places...Chicago Cut House, Chicago Chop, and David Burkes Primehouse.  Chicago Cut House had no available reservations; Chicago Chop had no prices on the menu, so my wife's first choice prevailed; David Burkes it was. I am so happy fate took us there. The ambiance and décor of the place was amazing. We were seated five minutes after arriving for our reservation. The shrimp cocktail and oyster appetizers were good, and I enjoyed my Caesar salad being prepared tableside.   Now for the real deal, the 55 day dry-aged steak. My waiter Matt R insisted that it would be worth my while to get the 55-day dry-aged steak. I took it as the typical wait staffs up sell of one of their expensive menu items. Ok save me the spiel, I said to myself, I am on a mini-vacation I plan on spending a lot anyway. Man was I singing a different tune after my first bite. I don't think I have had a better steak since then. The truffle fries were the best, my wife refused share them with me. Since it was my birthday Matt brought over two deserts for the table, he was a good server.  P.S. I have been to some of the best Italian restaurants, even a bar in NYC that endorses Campari. The negroni here was by far the best I've had anywhere.",0.9877,0.803,0.149,0.048,0.5088122605363985

2012-02-18,3.0,"David Burke's Primehouse used to be one of my Chicago all time favorites. But my last couple visits have caused the place to lose some of its luster. Recently when I've visited the Primehouse I haven't felt the love. If I'm going to drop some change at your restaurant, at least let me feel like my business is appreciated. On my last visit, the service was good, but we had a 9:30 reservation and didn't get seated until well after 10. Did we get an apology? A comped drink? Even acknowledgment that David Burke's Primehouse isn't interested in honoring reservations? Nope. That's pretty unprofessional in my opinion, and doesn't leave me wanting to return. The food at David Burke's is still top tier, but there are a lot of great steak joints in Chicago. I have definitely had better steaks at Gibsons, Mortons, and Kinzie and spent about the same. My favorite thing on the menu is the cheesecake lollipops, and they're not even made in house. As you can see, I'm running out of reasons to recommend the Primehouse. David Burke's Primehouse is a good spot to eat, but probably not worth the hassle. For the money you can go to any steak house in the city and probably get more attentive service--especially from the front of the house. I would go to Primehouse again if you're paying, but I don't see myself coming back. With so many options to choose from, I can't help but feel like I can do better somewhere else.",0.9832,0.752,0.175,0.073,0.44166666666666665
2012-02-14,5.0,"Well, first let's get something straight. In the arguments as to what is the best steakhouse in Chicago, I dont believe David Burke belongs in the comparison. That's because David Burke isnt a Chicago steakhouse. Its from New York, which also means that the kind of steaks they serve are different than what most Chicago steakhouses offer.  Chicago, like most Midwestern cities offer wet-aged steaks. which means the steaks are sealed in a bag after cutting to retain their moisture. David Burke dry-ages their steaks, which means they are hung to dry. It takes longer and is more expensive. But it retains the concentration of the natural flavor. That being said, this place is awesome. The beef is extremely tender and juicy with the right content of seasoning to enhance the flavor. I'd recommend getting either the 55-day ribeye or the 75-day ribeye. Do not order the Filet. That is a waste of money and you're not really going to savor the tenderness and flavor of a steak with a filet cut. Also, and if you're into a more hearty meal like myself, I would recommend getting the potato panakes as a side dish. Unbelievable.  You will not go wrong at this place if you're looking for a fine quality steak. Its better than any other steakhouse in the city. Just dont call it a Chicago steak--because its not from here.",0.9765,0.815,0.148,0.037,0.5666080447330448
2012-02-07,5.0,"Message boards are filled with debates as to which Chicago steakhouse is the best.  David Burke's Primehouse gets my vote!   The steaks are tasty and always perfectly prepared, but what distinguishes the Primehouse from other steakhouses is that it has unique side dishes and desserts.  Instead of a baked potato, you can order truffle French fries (delicious!) or souped-up mashed potatoes.  The veggies aren't merely steamed but have interesting sauces.  The desserts are equally as interesting; I recommend the donuts that you can fill yourself and the cheesecake lollipops.",0.9484,0.822,0.178,0.0,0.6075

2012-02-01,5.0,"I had an epic dinner last night at David Burke's Primehouse! I got there about 20 minutes before my 7 o'clock reservation, so I went ahead and ordered a Hibiscus Manhattan at the bar.   The drink was beautifully made and the flowery aroma was in full synergy with the bourbon.   I've got to find some of that liquor, apparently made right here in Chicago, so my wife can taste one of these bad boys. At the top of the hour, I went to the restaurant and got seated in a booth.   They had somewhat of a slow night, I guess, but I wasn't there for atmosphere.   My interest in being here had to do only with their food. Their wine list is quite extensive but I must admit their selection of wines by the glass leaves a lot to be desired.   It wasn't particularly approachable even though I consider myself fairly well versed when it comes to wines.   I ended up zeroing in on a bottle of ZD Cabernet which was a pretty good value at $89.   I figured even if I didn't finish it, I would be drinking a pretty solid wine that pairs quite nicely with a nice steak. After I ordered, I was brought a nice complimentary popover and a pad of butter.   While the popover wasn't amazing, it still tasted pretty good.   It wasn't quite as good as the popover I had at Tyler Florence's Wayfare Tavern in San Francisco, but it still was nothing to complain about. I started out with 4 oysters, one of each of the selections that they had to offer:  2 East coast and 2 West coast.   The platter was beautiful and the oysters tasted good.   I can't comment much more than that since my palate isn't all that sophisticated when it comes to oysters.   I like them, but I can't even quite pinpoint why that is. I followed it up with a wedge salad, which was very well prepared and tasted quite good.   I tried to eat a decent amount of the salad since I was about to embark on a beef eating binge and I had to get some vegetables in me first. At long last, the 75 day aged ribeye steak I ordered arrived perfectly cooked medium rare as I had requested.   In typical David O fashion, I chose the Mac & Cheese to accompany my beef with. The meat was absolutely amazing!   The last time I even remember eating such an amazing piece of beef was my dinner at Stripsteak in Las Vegas where I indulged in a beautiful Wagyu Ribeye that went for about the same price.   Needless to say while I typically eat small portions of beef I pretty much tore up this ribeye steak even a dog would have been proud of my work. The Mac & Cheese was good, not great.   Still, all in all it was a 5 star dining experience and I cannot wait to come back here very soon!",0.9981,0.755,0.203,0.042,0.6153463203463201
2012-01-31,5.0,"Some things just get better with age - cheese, wine, cognac, kimchee, etc.  I have had numerous steaks that were both wet aged and dry aged, but usually, these go 30 days, tops. So you can only imagine what 75 days does to a wonderfully prime piece of ribeye. It brings out a flavor profile that is unimaginable - we are talking about umami nirvana.  Just the natural beef flavor that exudes from the steak is so heavenly, so robust, it would be a shame to put any sauce on it.  As soon as it hits even a table nearby you can smell the wonderful char and beefy aroma that acts as a pheremone for me.  Our server suggested that we reserve one as soon as we got seated since there was a limited supply left.  I thought he was bullshitting me since I know that they must have 74 day aged steaks.  It was probably because they don't want to cut into another rack of meat towards the end of the night.  I have also heard some rumors about a 90 day aged steak, but that is total myth.  The chef told me that any much longer than 75 days and the meat starts to get a little funky, so it is pretty much the upper limit. There are also a great deal of other items other than the steak that are wonderful as well.  The kobe beef carpaccio served atop a slab of Himalayan pink salt is to beef as toro is to sushi.  The Kobe corn dogs were good but more of a novelty than anything else. Asiago garlic fries are good too, but gets to be a little bit on the heavy side after having a big steak. Oysters were incredibly fresh and shucked perfectly so that it retains all of its essence.  Of course, for dessert many tables were ordering the cheesecake lollipop tree or the pan-in red velvet cake. Occasionally if the kitchen is not overwhelmed, you can request a tour and you will get a peek at the masterpiece of the restaurant, their meat locker.  As the doors, opened, I felt like the gates of heaven itself were opening.  In a perfectly controlled environment, there are shelves and shelves of racks of USDA  prime meat, patiently undergoing the aging process.  The ""vault"" is lined with Himalayan link salt to help further control the humidity.  I estimated that there is over $100K worth of beef in there. Thank God I cannot easily cash out my 401k, because I have a feeling I would probably blow it on all of this meat. Other touches such as the leather table coverings help to create an environment that is impressive and chic but also warm and inviting.  A place that is on my list of Chicago must-go-to restaurants.",0.9989,0.753,0.224,0.024,0.5125258799171843

Keep in mind, I had a huge bday meal for lunch @ my work hours before -- consisted of 10 chicken wings and a huge brownie sundae. That stuff doesn't digest that easily, lets be real. So I am surprised I was so blown away by Primehouse even when I was still kind of full! This is a once in a lifetime experience. We got the wontons -- simple and very flavorful, we both ordered the 55-day dry aged ribeye and green beans w/ garlic. For dessert, we got the pear tartine I believe. Something like that. O. MAI. GAW. That steak melted in my moutttttth exploded with natural flavor and was soo tender. I will never forget the first bites I took of my ribeye. EVER. I almost can't describe how delicious this piece of meat was -- it had diff dimensions of flavor, sometimes a little blue-cheesy very subtle but so buttery and juicy...dear lord.

I'm really glad we went here though because of the Caesar Salad. Best Caesar Salad Ever! If I didn't like Thai papaya salad so much, I'd designate the salad from here the best salad ever! Honestly, I'll be back just for this sometime soon. Steaks - I got the 75 day ribeye since the 55 day ribeye was sold out. Gf got the 35 day Kansas City. Honestly, I preferred her cut more as I think ribeyes are just too fatty. I could tell that the flavors seemed more concentrated and just so rich... Very good stuff, but I'm just as happy spending less at Morton's or another steakhouse. I think if they offered other cuts, I'd love the steaks.

2012-01-17,3.0,"This was a once-in-a-blue-moon kind of adventure for us.  Never did I think I'd eat here but, lo and behold, it happened.   Now, sure, ""steakhouse"" precludes a lot of expectations.  As does a place with pricing such as this.  I was kind of let down.  I did try to set aside expectations as well as ignore the fact that eating here would cost as much as half my monthly rent, but it's hard to do that when the restaurant is not really getting it right.  Everyone in my party was expecting to be blown away, really wanted to be blown away, kept grasping at straws to be blown away, kept trying to get caught up in the flash of it all to love everything. The decor was surprisingly not chic or stylish or up to par or whatever the word is I'm looking for.  Clever with the fitted tablecloths, but they were vinyl, not leather as it was trying to suggest.  I should have known that that would be an omen for everything David Burke's. Everyone was very nice, which is great, but we felt (or at least the hubs and I felt) some were a little too casual with us.  And after perusing the menu, the hubs turned to me and said, ""huh, the pricing they show on the internet is not up to date with the menu.""  I was a bit surprised by that, that a place like this didn't maintain their website. Ok, anyway.  It was apparently a food splurge night.  Appetizers were the wagyu beef sashimi (very good though a zingy black peppery after bite kind of undid it), scallops and tuna tartare.  The latter two everyone else enjoyed.  Caesar salad made table side, very tasty (and retro which doesn't seem to fit with anything else they're doing), though the chili was a bit harsh.  Popovers were fantastic and came out in metal measuring cups -- clever, but again, didn't seem to fit with anything else they were doing. The hubs got the 75 day aged ribeye and it was, I have to say, unlike any other ribeye I've ever tasted.  It was indeed very tender and delicious, but I guess I have a hard time seeing how a piece of meat, not a very large one at that, can cost nearly a dollar a day for sitting alone in a salt cellar.  The brother in law had the 55 day and it was also very good.  The sister in law, the bone-in filet and me, I ordered the 35 day aged sirloin.  I wanted the regular filet, but my husband suggested I try an aged steak since we were there and that did make good sense.  I'm normally not a fan of sirloin so my hubs said to the server, ""convince her as to why she should get it.""  He said ""you'll never eat another filet again"" and that was all he said.  So, ok, I guess I'll try it.  It's a $52 experiment, but ok. Everyone is digging in, I'm having a hard time cutting my steak, get a piece off of the fatty thing which is no more impressive than a steak I can get at the grocery store, start chewing and it's tough and tastes awful.  At that very second, someone walked by and saw my face, so she offered to take it away and get me something else which was very nice.  And at that moment, by her reaction, I had this odd feeling that this happens often; whether it does or not, I don't know.  Everyone at the table said they'd try it, give it a go, but no one liked it so the woman carted it off.  I shared my sister in law's filet and it was good.  I've had better filets though.  Plus I can't really figure out why a bone-on filet would be $7 more than the regular filet.  The server came by and said maybe the sirloin had gone 45 days, eh, ya know, maybe it went bad....passing the buck, suggesting that the kitchen was serving a rotten steak which was off-putting.  I find it hard to believe someone would lose tabs on how the meat is doing in a place that touts aged meats, but then again, I don't know. A la carte sides were potato pancakes which I thought would be like latkes but were like pancakes.  They were ok, not very potato-y.  Whipped potatoes, which for my brother in law, are hard to mess up.  Spicy asparagus was too spicy for my sister in law who was the only one who tried it. I guess in summing up, the whole place and experience felt uneven to me and not on the same track with itself.  I don't know how long the place has been open but it felt like it opened recently with kinks and inconsistencies of theme that need a work-through.  I felt like everything was sort of flashy for flashy's sake, but there wasn't any actual flash.  Like the hype or suggested prestige of eating here was supposed to be enough to carry the food and the experience but neither did.  I almost feel duped.  To me, it's not worth the price, doesn't live up to the hype and given the opportunity again, I wouldn't opt for this place even if someone else was paying.",0.9976,0.802,0.135,0.063,0.5183177476118651

When my eating friend started to pick away at the leftover fat on the plate, I was both concerned for his arteries and impressed that a steak could produce fat that was so tempting to eat. When he asked for the bone to be wrapped up (for soup), I was mildly afraid he was going to throw in the fat too (for fried rice or something). Luckily he didn't. Speaking of fried rice, bone marrow fried rice is the most delicious thing EVER.

I have been to every steakhouse in the city and knew that this place had high quality meat I took my father here for his birthday, just the two of us. We were seated right away even though the restaurant was full. Waited a little while before seeing our server, understandable, the place was busy. He took our order and went on his way...I started off with the lobster bisque, it was like just having melted butter and cream, how about adding some lobster stock. I had less than a quarter of it and the only reason I had that much was because I was dipping my bread in it. 10 minutes has passed and the waiter finally comes to the table to check in, probably because I slid the creamy butter in a bowl to the edge of the table. Did I mention that I have had an empty beer in front of me for almost 20 minutes now.  I ordered a rib-eye, medium rare and my dad ordered a strip-steak, medium. As my dad is chewing his first bite and before I even take my first bite, here is the waiter asking how the steak is. Neither of us even knew yet.  This was the last time we saw our waiter at the table. My steak was cooked medium well and my dad's was cooked rare. I get that a busy steakhouse kitchen can have dozens of steaks in the window, sending out the wrong one can happen.  My soup wasn't good, waited 20 minutes for a beer, and now two wrong steaks. I could have gotten past all this, just bring us out what we ordered.  No one checked on us, no one cared. 20 minutes more passes. At that point I pushed both steaks to the middle of the table, hoping someone would come by. The busboy did, he pointed at the steaks, I said we were done...Finally I stopped someone and asked for our check.

2011-12-13,2.0,"Blah. Today was my second time at David Burke's and it was not so hot. I would give this place 2.5 stars if I could. My first visit was about a year ago and it was very tasty (maybe 4 stars), today I went for a work luncheon and it just wasn't all there. Our apps were fine, the lobster bisque is definitely better than some of the steak places nearby. The steaks were the disappointment for me. For starters, the restaurant was empty, maybe 3 other tables full. It was so quiet we heard the older women who worked the hostess booth yakking on the phone to her friends. With a restaurant so slow you would expect the kitchen to be on top of everything. Our first course took about 40 minutes to arrive. Then it took about another 15 minutes for our steaks. Two steak orders were screwed up. Mine was waaaaaay overcooked. I ordered medium rare and got medium well. How does that happen when you're got only a few tables there? The other steak was just the wrong order and as everyone got served, one guy at my table they never showed him his plate they took it back. It took about 10 minutes for his plate to come out. Someone came by as I got my steak finally and said sorry, but that was it. She was not a manager, or at least I don't think she was as she was not very professional about it at all. To make up for the kitchen's failure we were comped a $5 filled doughnuts dessert which was gross. Thanks a lot (sarcasm). For the fun of it I ordered the pumpkin creme brulee which was interesting. It wasn't done in a ramekin like creme brulees generally are, instead is the was shallowest bowl (essentially a plate) you could imagine. It was okay. Not sure how this place went downhill, but the kitchen really was not on its game today. With so many steak options in this city, I will not be back.",0.899,0.861,0.086,0.052,0.44484987946526405

Started with the Wagyu Beef Sashimi.  Amazing small bites.  So tender and full of flavor.  My only question is what are the margins on this item?  At $15 bucks I am betting we're looking at 80% to 90%.   On to the Caesar salad with all of the fixins including anchovies.  Delicious.  They make it table side and it is a nice little experience.  Plenty enough for the wife and me to split one order and both get our fill.

2011-12-01,4.0,"My wife and I went to David Burke's last night for a celebratory dinner. While everything was good, I left wishing it had been a little bit better.  Our waitress was nice enough, but lacked the subtle skills of a truly good server.  For dinner we had the shrimp cocktail, scallop appetizer, caesar salad with crab cake croutons, their special for the night, a 35 day dray aged wagyu bone in rib eye, and the 35 day Kansas City sirloin.   The cheese popovers were delicious and a nice change from the usual bread that you receive.  The shrimp were good, though I wanted some additional horseradish to go with it, but our server didn't come back to check on us.  the scallops were also good, but for $15 I expected more then two small scallops, they should either come with 4 scallops, or at least get some larger ones. The caesar salad was very good, a it was nice to have it assembled table side.  I would how ever skip the crab sake croutons. They aren't croutons, they are little deep fried balls of crab cake mixture, and while not bad, they aren't worth $5 for 4 (small) ""croutons"" and I didn't feel they added anything to the salad.  My wagyu ribeye was very good.  Extremely well marbled (as to be expected) and very tender, and cooked perfectly.   My wife's Kansas City Sirloin came out over cooked the first time (ordered medium rare, and it was medium well/well done).  Our server had the steak removed and a fresh one refired for us with out any issue, and on the second try the kitchen was spot on.   The manager did stop by to make sure my wife was happy with her steak.  Things I didn't like: the background music being played was early 90's alternative, and while I like that style of music, its not what I want to hear at a nice steak house.  I also didn't love the servers uniform which consisted of jeans.  I'm not sure if they were trying to play up the ""cowboy"" theme, but again this is a nice restaurant, I think the servers should dress the part as well.   As I said before our waitress was kind of lacking, while she was polite, she could of been a bit more attentive, and we would of appreciated if she would of shown some interest in us.  Like asking us if this dinner was a special event (which it was).  My point is that when I am a $400 two top in  your section I expect a bit better service.  We are fortunate who have many wonderful steak houses in Chicago.  While I enjoyed the steaks at David Burke's, I didn't think the dry aging added that much to the steak.  I have had equally good steaks at Gibson's and Ruth's Chris.  If I return next time I will try the 55 day ribeye.",0.9989,0.741,0.231,0.029,0.5649550264550265

2011-11-19,4.0,"This review is for both breakfast and dinner at David Burke's Primehouse, so it is an averaged score.  First for breakfast we got there about 8:30, during the week. It was not overly busy, we got seated rather quickly. Initially the menu looks kinda pricey but after taking into consideration that most of the breakfasts come with coffee and fruit it isn't a bad deal. I had the classic breakfast and my wife had the eggs benedict. First of all the coffee was excellent, very good and the service as well, they always kept it topped off. Our breakfast arrived and the portions were hardy enough. My eggs (scrambled) were a little over cooked, but the breakfast potatoes mixed with peppers and onions were delicious and the bacon was awesome, you could tell it was artisanal quality. They also included a nice European butter plate sprinkled with the Himalayan sea salt (they use this on everything).  My wife thought the hollandaise her benedict was not as warm as it should be and wasn't all that special but was happy with the portion and with the breakfast potatoes as well. Removed one star. For the dinner meal we had a nice large booth near the back, since we were on our honeymoon it was nice since it was quite and intimate. The restaurant doesn't really look or feel like your usual steakhouse, which I'm fine with. Our server, although I can't recall his name did a great job, he explained all of the dishes with great detail and listed the specials.  Unfortunately as we had a large lunch we were not as hungry as one should probably be when visiting a restaurant such as this. But we did our best. We had ambitions of getting the cake in a can (look here for a picture:  leenaeats .c...) but that wasn't happening that night. They brought out their table bread, which is more like a popover. I read that some people didn't care for it, even calling it weird. Tasted similar to a popover to me, it was light and airy, with a nice eggy texture, and good butter, that helps too. Now, this guy is obsessed with Himalayan pink sea salt, he uses it on everything and it's in a grinder on the table, I'm not complaining. We weren't going to eat a regular appetizer due to our tank was already near full on our way in. Our server brought us a small snack anyhow. My wife ordered the N.Y. Sirloin, aged 21 days. I ended up ordering the 55 day bone-in ribeye. I should have went for the 75, but as dry aged beef of these time frames are not something I'm accustomed to I wussed out. We also ordered as sides, the mac n cheese and the ""loaded baked potato"". First off, the mac and cheese was a baked rigatoni, it was quite good and was accompanied by some tasty pesto. The baked potato was our moment of non-agreement. I thought it was quite good for something that was a new take on a traditional steak house side item. It was really a potato gnocchi with cheese and a chive pesto/sauce topped with chopped barbecued bacon. My wife did not like they bacon, the bbq sauce was pretty sweet, but the quality of the bacon was top notch.  Now, the steaks, yes they are expensive, really expensive. I tried both my wife's and my steak and tried to compare them honestly. Since her's was medium-well and mine was medium-rare it was quite a contrast. I will say I was worried that they might not get the steak exactly how we wanted them in regards to doneness. I've read some other reviews where people had to send it back, but hey people are picky about their steak, especially their $70 steak. Now, the Primehouse doesn't try to fancy up their steaks, they are served simply with the steak on a white plate with nothing but the steak's own juices and sprig of rosemary. I can say, happily that the steaks were perfectly and expertly prepared, even fore medium well my wife's steak was still extremely juicy with just the faintest hint of pink left. My steak was everything that I wanted and more. The aging process lends a pleasant amount of delicate flavors to the beef along with it being grass-fed USDA prime. There was a certain tanginess to the beef that along with the extreme tenderness and marbling of the steak was almost like it melted in my mouth. It was a good sized steak and even though I was so full by that time I finished it quite easily. Now, we were not going to order desert at all by this time, but our poor server, probably disappointed in us for not celebrating very effectively and lamenting his potentially smaller tip at the possibility of us not having a higher tab (that's what I would think if I was in his shoes). Said to hold tight and he was going to bring us out something small. He brought out an order of the kickin' (fillurown) donuts. They were quite good and we managed to fit them in somewhere and it a very nice gesture, that they did not have to provide. We did leave him a pretty good tip. Breakfast was okay for the price or I would have given it five stars. I would definetly recommend David Burke's Primehouse.",0.9993,0.784,0.177,0.039,0.5793437790279894

The lady and I arrived to a low lit, trendy restaurant with sprinklings of couples, familes, and friends of all ages and races.  Wine bottles lined the opening walkway and added to the decor, providing a visual preview of what we were about to explore. Our meal was a four-course delight with wine pairings that also included a tour of the dry-age room complete with Himalayan salt wall.  Little did I know that Primehouse is one of a few restaurants that uses this process. Disclaimer - I can't remember all of the wines we had, but we started with champagne, then did a tour of a few continents.  As for the eats, we had a crab tasting, followed by popovers before enjoying sashimi and short rib and lobster dumplings.  Caesar salads (that would make Julius jealous) held us over until the steak entrees.   Pro: the salad is tossed, and caesar dressing mixed, right in front of you and sprinkled with the pepper of your choosing.  Con: that terrible joke I just made about Julius Caesar. We ordered one of each of the two steaks being showcased: the 55-day aged bone-in ribeye and the filet.  Winner by unanimous decision: the ribeye, but the bout went 12 rounds.  Medium rare, both steaks came, which is how you should order them, no matter how you like your meat. We finished with a chocolate mousse cake and small, ""doughnut hole"" like pastries that came with a variety of flavored creams to enjoy.

The smokiness of the bacon paired with the sweet maple dip was great, but when bacon is involved how can you wrong.  Next up was the table prepared caesar salad. That is if you aren't facing the wall as I was. While my salad was be prepared it was all to my back. I had wished I turned and given more input because I do enjoy the anchovies flavor in my salad. With the garlic and parmesan flavors coming through strong the salad just needed a strong anchovies flavor. Next time I won't sit with my back to the action.  The main course and the reason for my trip arrived. My steak was prepared as rare as I like it. The deep beef flavor was there and intense.  With just the steak arriving on the plate you order your sides a la carte. I felt this was the weakest part of the meal.

2011-10-20,4.0,"I've been to David Burke's in NYC and in Chicago and they're both good.  It'll be an interesting drive to get there if you're in Chicago because it's not immediately noticeable while you're driving. The directions I used actually tell you it's on the other side of the intersection when it's not! And the sign is just barely noticeable if you're paying close attention. Needless to say there were a few drives around the block before we actually got ourselves inside the restaurant.  David Burke's Primehouse cheese popovers are amazingly delicious and I am salivating right now just thinking about them. And seriously I would go back just for those if nothing else. Ok, maybe not, but they're still really good. Recently I went for my Dad's birthday and both he and my mother were very pleased, which rarely happens!  My dad had the classic Filet Mignon well done, which he claims was delicious. My mom had the salmon, which was also tasty and I had the roasted chicken breast. We also got some sides for good measure, but they were totally unnecessary because the entrees were pretty large.  I would give the food an A, but the service wasn't as great, but still not terrible by any means. I told the hostess before we were seated that it was my dad's birthday. She said that she would make sure that the evening was special for him. I expected at least a small desert of some sort to come out after our dinner, but there was nothing. I waited and waited and tried to get my parents to hold off on ordering dessert, and finally they decided to get some tea before leaving. My dad kept asking, ""you sure you guys don't' want dessert?"" And I reassured him I wasn't hungry for more food. 10-15 minutes later and our waitress comes by and hands us the bill and hasn't made our night special like they said they would. Before she collects the bill she comes back and motions me to the back room where she apologizes for forgetting to bring out some cake. Tells me to hold off on leaving because she has something to bring out. So now I go back and feign some story about how the line in the bathroom was outrageous and I have to wait to use it and so my parents are forbidden to leave just yet. Eventually she brought out this delicious chocolate cake with ice cream that I don't think was actually on the menu. While we were slightly annoyed that she had forgotten to bring it out, the fact that it was so tasty made us feel better!",0.9934,0.814,0.136,0.05,0.5487103174603175

Instead of bread, they served this amazing ""eggy popover"" that was light and fluffy - and delicious!  The Caesar Salad was prepared tableside (yes, dressing too!) - best Caesar dressing I've ever had!  We completed the night with the Cake in a Can.  Yep, as you probably guessed, it was the best red velvet-y deliciousness I've ever had, topped with cream cheese frosting and their homemade vanilla bean ice cream! One thing I learned is that I should have picked my sides more appropriately.  I picked the spicy asparagus and the asiago truffle fries.  Both were delicious, but they had such strong flavors.  I wish I went with sides that were more neutral, like steamed green beans and polenta fries or mashed potatoes.  The strong flavors distracted from the amazing steak flavors for me, so we ended up devouring the steak first, and then eating the sides afterwards.

2011-10-03,4.0,"So my review will only cover their brunch. The place looks pretty swanky and it sounds like they have awesome dry aged beef.  The interior is nice.  They have random Himalayan rock salt decorations and a glass room full of wine.  We went around 2 and they were still serving brunch.  The place was pretty empty, but I imagine they're pretty full at night.  The service was good and attentive, but I suppose it should have been with only a few groups in there.  They must be connected to a hotel because when the check came they asked if we had a room (I guess you can charge the meal to the room?). The brunch menu has some of the normal breakfast items on the a la carte side, but the unique thing that I saw was they have these things called Brunch in a Box.  The idea is each box has a theme and you get a Japanese bento with 4 or so items revolving around the theme. I tried the Egg themed Brunch in a Box.  It came with a Benedict, lobster scramble, egg in a basket, and a chive biscuit.  The chive biscuit was a little bit dry and dense for me, but eating it with some of the other items helped it out.  Egg in a basket was good and topped with some chicken sausage.  The lobster scramble was good.  There was quite a bit of it and the chive biscuit worked well with it.  My favorite of the bunch was the eggs Benedict.  The egg was done well and oozed out when cut into.  There was a little bit of heat from the spicy ham but the hollandaise goes well with it. I also got one of their juices, the Power Driver.  It consisted of carrot, ginger, and orange juice.  I like the addition of ginger as it adds a little something that lingers when you have a sip. For brunch I think the place is pretty awesome.  The Brunch in a Boxes are a bit on the pricier side, but definitely not unreasonable.  There was more than enough food and there are plenty of items in the 10-15 range on the a la carte side that also sounded pretty darn good.  I like variety so the Boxes were awesome for me.",0.9966,0.818,0.172,0.01,0.6965277777777779

2011-09-14,4.0,"""75 day aged bone-in ribeye"" is all I need to say and it's all you should be focused on when dining here. It is worth every penny of the $62 price tag and is 1 of the 5 best pieces of BEEF I've ever eaten in my entire life. BEEF. It's definitely what's for dinner folks at David Burke's Primehouse. Here's how it went down for my client and I: BEEF: + 75 Day aged bone-in RIBEYE. $65. Intense beef flavor is how they describe it and that's what it was. I had it requested Rare at 120 degrees and it was done to perfection. It was deep, bold, intense, flavorful, and had the perfect amount of fat/marbling to enhance it's beefy-ness. It was nothing shy of exquisite!  Savory Foods: + Wagyu Beef Sashimi. $15.  Black pepper, maple syrup, Himalayan salt, mushroom chips and truffle mayo. If there's anything on the menu featuring truffle folks, I'll be ordering it. It was succulent, juicy and was quite velvetty! The maple syrup provided a tad hint of sweetness while the himalayan salt was soft and not overly briney to complement well with the Wagyu. + Foie Gras. $18. Rum roasted tart cherries & black walnut short stack. Yes folks, you get 3 small baby-sized pancakes that were good though I don't think it did too much for this dish on it's own. HOWEVER, the rum roasted tart cherries were FANTASTIC!!! You HAVE to order this dish just for the rum roasted tart cherries!!! Oh, and the foie gras was very good, not the best I've had but just ""very good"". + King Crab. $20. Arugala, mustard crema and cocktail sauce. It was as good as king crab should be, nothing really to write here except that it was fresh, large, juicy and meaty. + Creamy spinach. $7. It was a solid ""good"" and paired well with the steak. Frankly I wasn't overly focused on it and it wasn't the best creamed/creamy spinach I've had but it wasn't the worst either. Sweet Foods: + Lollipop Tree. $14. A collection of cheesecake lollipops and whip cream. This dessert looked cooler than it tasted...it was just ""okay"" but I'm giving it a plus because it looked really cool and it wasn't ""horrible"". The concept of a lollipop tree isn't new but it's still ""fun"".! :)  + Banana Split Sundae. $10. Salted caramel chocolate ice cream, caramelized banana, brandied cherries, spiced pecans and roasted pineapple. This was highly recommended by the waiter and it definitely didn't disappoint. It was one of the best sundae's I've ever had and the caramelized bananas were fantastic! I didn't taste the brandied cherries though but this dessert is big enough for you to split  with someone! Service: - & +. The service at times was quirky. It was good and funky at the same time. There was confusion at times with what was being served at our table as we were given steak knives when the Wagyu beef sashimi was arriving only to be replaced by butter knives. Other times the bread basket was brought to us 2x when we had a full one (though we had requested more bread), just that they brought 1 after the other instead of just 1. Obviously there was confusion/one food runner/busboy not knowing that another had brought bread to our table. It took them a while to remember to bring olive oil for our bread and this was after 4 requests. But after the service quirkyness, our waiter was actually extremely nice, quite patient and definitely did make some great recommendations. So, with the aforementioned stated, I give David Burke's Primehouse in the windy city 4 Yelps due to their lackluster lollipop cheesecake dessert and quirky service. However, the steak was 1 of the top 5 I've ever had, it's a very nice restaurant and does serve some fantastic food overall. I will return the next time I'm in Chi-town.

Not a ribeye as the menu indicated because the bone was still attached.  For $62.00 I expected a larger piece of meat.  It was probably only 12-14 oz.  It was cooked perfectly medium as per my request but lacked seasoning.  It definitely had very good beefy, savory flavors that one usually doesn't encounter with steak.  The asiago truffle oil fries were good but could have been crispier.  Overall I feel slighted at how much we spent and how underwhelmed I was with the steak.",0.9689,0.832,0.168,0.0,0.5963157894736841

My friends and I will never ever go to this place nor would we ever suggest anyone to ever come here.  We were in town visiting so I suggested we go and enjoy some aged steaks at David Burkes since it was known to have aged steaks and that they raise and butcher their own cattle. We were all seated promtly, 6 of us, and were well greeted. Then it started going downhill from there! Our server kept trying to upsell what she could from drinks to added extras on our steaks. How are we supposed to enjoy this so called ""aged"" steaks if sauce is drenched all over it!  The beef sashimi appetizers were good and the salads were great. The cesear salad was really good but don't get the added crab balls. It is really just 3 small battered fried crabs and you couldn't even taste it. THE STEAKS! OMG! WHAT A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!!! WE HAD TO RETURN ALL OF OUR STEAKS MORE THAN 3 TIMES.  THAT IS A TOTAL OF 9 STEAKS! IF YOU ARE PAYING FOR STEAKS OVER $70 YOU SHOULD DARN WELL PREPARE IT WELL ENOUGH TO EAT! IT HAD NO CHAR AND IT WAS WELL OVER COOKED WHEN WE REPEATEDLY ASKED FOR MEDIUM RARE! HOW HARD IS IT FOR A WELL RESPECTED AND KNOWN STEAKHOUSE TO MAKE A DECENT STEAK FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS?! Even the floor manager and the waitstaff noticed how well done the steaks were!  The red velvet cake was moist and good but it takes over an hour to prepare. Since it is baked freshed it should be good. I would never reccommend this place to anyone! It was a major embarrassment to me since I was the one who suggested we go there! Maybe it was a hit or miss kind of place. I expected better since we are paying over $70 for one darn piece of steak!",0.9816,0.806,0.139,0.054,0.5558641975308642

The Bacon Sticks are pork belly with a maple glaze- they taste just like pieces of really thick bacon- very good! The Tuna Tartar was good, but nothing special.   For dinner, my BF had the 55 Day Ribeye which he thoroughly enjoyed and has been talking about ever since. I went with Angry Sirloin, which was deelish, but I wish it was a little Angrier. I guess I have a high tolerance for spicy. For sides (which are a la carte), we shared the Garlicky Spinach and the Classic ""Baked Potato"". The spinach was good, but not anything special. The ""Baked Potato"" was amazing! It was actually gnocchi with chive sour cream, cheddar cheese, and bacon!  My BF and I aren't usually gnocchi fans, but we both agreed this side was outta this world.  For dessert, my darling BF surprised me by pre-ordering the Red Velvet Cake in Can. YUM. They waiter came out with a round 9 inch red velvet cake in a tin and 2 bowls- 1 bowl of cream cheese frosting and 1 bowl of vanilla bean ice cream. They asked whether we wanted to frost the cake ourselves, but we opted to have them frost it table side. The cake was just outta the oven-it was still warm and the frosting and ice cream were fabulous. And, they even gave us 2 complimentary glasses of champagne for my birthday- how sweet is that?!  Bonus- I had more than plenty of left over cake to take home to keep the birthday celebration going for days. The service at DB was also great. Our waitress was great at giving recommendations and was very attentive.

For my main I order the award winning 55 day dry aged bone in rib eye. I'm expecting this to be the best steak I've ever had. Maybe it's this expectation that leads to my feeling somewhat let down. It wasn't til I got right down to the bone that I really got that wonderfully funky flavor I was looking for. Perhaps I'll get that throughout the entire cut when I return to try the 75 day. I do the 1/2 lobster accompaniment and find that while the claw was succulent the tail was tough, and the tamale wasn't present. I went a bit overboard and ordered a side of truffle asiago fries and they were the best truffle fries I've ever had. For dessert I had Kahlua ice cream and banana mousse served atop a brownie.

BF and I are steak lovers and we've been to quite a few steakhouses in Las Vegas and Los Angeles.  We were drooling over pictures posted by yelpers on the amazing 55 day ribeye and the ""south side"" that I bookmarked this place as an absolutely must try.  Our expectations were probably too high that the steaks turned out to be quite a disappointment. Here's a rundown of what we ordered: Caesar Salad Kobe Corn Dog West Coast oysters South side 55 day ribeye Caesar salad was great, I would love to have an order of the salad to go for lunch. Kobe corn dog was okay, nothing special. The west coast oyster was definitely not the freshest I've tasted but why did I order west coast oyster after flying 3.5 hours to chicago from LA? South side was a disapointment.  Go to Joe's Prime steak and crab's instead.  The steak was ridiculously cooked unevenly.  It was well done on the sides and pretty much rare for the meats that are closer to the bone.  Now, I understand that it's a thick, bone-in steak that it's hard to have it medium rare through out but com'n, the burns on the outside tasted bitter!  Usually, I love the burns on the outside as it's usually quite flavorful, but not this one! 55 day ribeye was...eh, not how we likes our dry age steak to be.  The steak had this taste that we felt the himalayan salt wall did not enhance it's beefy flavor. The table we sat at was sorta like in the middle of the hallway that the seat behind me were pretty close and I had no space to stretch. We left without finishing our steak and it costs $180 for this steak dinner that left us unsatisfied.

Service:  Great service from start to finish.  The host(ess) will seat you and offer to take your coat.  The servers are knowledgeable and attentive.  You can even visit their salt room where they dry age some of the steaks.   Food:  Awesome!!!!!  Highly recommend the 55-day aged bone-in ribeye, trust me.  My wife had the normal filet mingon, which was good also.  But I had to fight her off from eating more than just a bite of my ribeye.  Worth the extra 15-20 bucks if you're really into steaks.  They have a longer aged option, but I'm scared to try since that's pushing the biological barier.The sides are where I thought they were just ok, but it might have been because it paled in comparison to the steaks.  The garlic spinach and asiago fries are good.  For dessert, you gotta have the cheese cake lollipop tree.  Pretty extensive collection of wines, we just picked a cab sauv that was reasonable in price....good, but not memorable.   Overall, best steak I've ever had....and a really great dining experience.",0.994,0.755,0.206,0.039,0.6016666666666667

The steak was great - not as sublime as in other premier steak houses I've been to, but tasty nonetheless. I was expecting a bolder, beefier flavor for $65, but to me, it tasted no different from what you'd get at Morton's. The foie gras complemented the meat nicely. The side dishes were a bit on the small side, but delicious. I recommend the truffle asagio fries as a bold side, and the scallops with apricot chutney for an appetizer.

David Burke's was not bad but you expect a certain level of service, decor and quality from any top notch steak restaurant and David Burke's is the at or near the top price wise ($60-80 steaks) so you should be able to expect even more, yet everything screamed mediocre at best. I was confused ay first when we arrived because I thought the restaurant was the hotels bar as the ambience in really non-existent .  The tables are covered in leather which makes some sense for a steak house, however, in our booth both seats had several large rips with stuffing sticking out, It felt like we were at a cheap diner.  The acoustics are poor and it is very loud making it hard to converse. Service was not good either, while the waiters were clearly trying to inflate the bill by gushing over the highest price menu items, they forgot the basics of how to make money, give good service and come by once in a while to make sure everyone is happy.  We saw our waitress a total of 5 times the entire evening and were flagging down bus staff to get refills on my wife's drink and I was never able to get a second (or third) cocktail. One of the few  times we saw the waitress was after we got our meal, my aged ribeye was done correctly at medium rare and was tasty but not the best I have had, while my spouses medium was actually bloody and red through, almost beyond rare.  Any good steak house has the waiter there when you get your steak and they wait as you cut in to ensure the steak is correctly done.  Our food was delivered by the bus staff like at a TGIF's and we waited ten minutes until I could get the waitresses attention to get them to take the steak back an fix it. By the time desert was offered we really no longer in the mood to continue the meal there so we declined even though we began the meal expecting to stretch out the evening with desert and port.   The high point of the service was the that bill was delivered quickly and taken care of in a timely manner.",0.9697,0.816,0.114,0.07,0.49558024691358005

Some waiters are out for gouging and I like that Jeremy pointed out flavor profiles as well. We added on the 3 sides, all good but none were touched since we already had sooo much food. Losing the 5th star: When we were seated, you have to wait for server to come around with menus. Our server was at another table so we sat waiting for almost 10 minutes without menus, water or wine list. Seemed strange and bad practice. And we saw our waiter was busy, so not his fault.

I got a 40 day dry aged ribeye.  It was competently cooked and it was what it should have been, except maybe a little more well done than I'd have liked.  I asked for just shy of medium, maybe the waiter misunderstood me and asked for a bit more than medium.  At any rate, it was fine.  I had a nice complex, beefy flavor.   The beer selection, well, let's just say it was pretty poor.  They had two beers on draft, one was some light lager, and the other was a hefe-weizen style beer.  A handful of bottled beers.  I got a bottle of Guinness, and props to the waiter, he poured it properly.  That said, something more interesting than a guinness would have made me much happier.  If you like a good beer with your steak, as I do, this is not your place.  But poor beer selection seems to be endemic to Chicago.  Put some thought into your beer selection, restaurants.

We ordered the cheesecake lollipop tree dessert to-go (we were on the clock with the babysitter and just wanted to get home at this point) which was an awesome idea- they kept in the fridge great and we got mini desserts to eat over the next day or so.  Our server did bring us some complimentary sorbet to eat at the end- but I would've much rather had a good steak done correctly.

I think my idea of romantic is different than the restaurant's because they tried to seat us in a horseshoe booth big enough for 4 or 5 overlooking a large party of about 15 people. I requested a new table and they moved us to a regular booth. This was good. I like to sit across from Michele so we can see each other while we are talking.

We split a crab cake and, although I think it might have been just a little light on the crab, it was very good. They brought out 2 dinner rolls in small cans. They were like puff pastries and I had to have another with dinner. Our server, Matt, did a wonderful job of taking care of us. We never felt rushed which was really nice because when I say they were busy, I mean they were absolutely slammed. Matt described the aged steaks in a manner that made me lean toward the 40 day ribeye, but he said he really like the 35 day Kansas City, so we ordered both and shared.

2011-05-20,4.0,"4 stars, lets just say we were in and out with the quickness Me and a group of friends chose this spot as the steakhouse to visit when in Chicago since it was ranked as 1 of the top 10 steakhouses in america. I had to give this place a high 4 stars, their steak was borderline excellent. Exceptional would be the word I would use for their steaks. 75 day old sitting in a salt room with Himilayian salt cubes drawing the moisture from these steaks. The portion for me was ok, for the amount paid I believe a second slab would of sufficed. chose med-rare like I do most my steaks, the charred crisp taste on the outside and silky red meat on the inside was pleasant. Again the steak was good I give them that but it was not great. Portion being one factor, the other factor was the taste, it had all the elements but lacked to me that wow factor, you know when you get something that is special and when you bite down you can honestly say it was worth every penny sadly here came close but didn't quite hit its mark. In regards to service our wine connoisseur she seemed to be on top of her game offering us several choices of wines and pointing out what would go best with our steaks, our waitresses on the other hand lacked I guess service, didn't really check up on our party for refills of water or if we wanted to try other options on the menu, it seemed we had more interaction with the waiters that actually brought our steaks out then our regular waitress. For me anytime I go to a steak house, especially one that prides itself on it steaks usually there is some sort of introduction to your meal or some information on what you will be feasting on, Mortons I know does this, Alexanders, Ruth Chris etc you get the picture, here we thought it was a little odd we didnt get this presentation. People around us got this intro if not suggestions on selections of meat and how it was process or even how the 55 or 75 day old process takes place. For a steak house of this caliber, being ranked one of the top 10 in America score fell for me on service from 5 to 3 stars, I did read some other reviews apparently I didn't feel alone in this. Seemed we were a bit rushed, they already had our orders in place, and our appitizers set didn't seem they cared much for us after they got our orders, more or less felt like hurry up finish your steaks and get out. After our rushed meal they did offer us a viewing of there room where the 55 to 75 day aging process happens, this was a plus for us, I guess they saw we weren't to happy with the service, they also did offer to get us a limo to other events or clubs in the area which I though was a nice touch.  Not sure if i would make it back to the Primehouse, again the steaks were exceptional but not excellent. service flopped which I understand sometimes happens from night to night. My only request is that they don't try to rush you out the door. food **** almost but not quite worth 5 stars service *** making up for rushing us with limo rides and views of your aging process does not scratch off the fact that we were rushed. 5 stars for our wine connoisseur she made our stay pleasant and informative price $$$ range of 50 and up on steaks ambiance *** dark like most steak houses, impressive wine list  might be one of the top 10 in America in my book it due to service hard 3 stars, 4 for the steaks.",0.9956,0.854,0.117,0.028,0.4986976337838407
2011-05-19,2.0,"I think I've finally given up on steakhouses. It may be unfair to single out Primehouse, but it was the last straw. I eat out at prime steakhouses pretty often--S&W, Ruth's Chris, Morton's, BLT Steak, etc. My biggest frustration is how often I have to send back a steak for not being cooked right. Long ago I learned to forgo the conventional ""rare,"" ""medium-rare,"" ""medium,"" etc nomenclature in favor of specifying explicitly to my server precisely that ""I'd like a warm, red center."" I nonetheless end up sending more than half my steaks back for being overcooked.  So tonight I go to Primehouse, order the 75-day dry-aged bone-in rib-eye for $65, specify ""warm, red center,"" and they deliver me a gray steak (i.e. medium-well/well-done). I've learned from past experience to steel myself against this all-too-common steakhouse mistake and calmly send it back. But it's stressful to send a steak back, especially in a business-social situation like I was in where I don't know my dining companions very well and don't want to look fussy or pretentious. And in this instance I couldn't help feeling especially inhibited about sending back a piece of meat so carefully sourced and dry-aged for so long. It makes me look like a priss, even though I really do know what a difference ""medium-rare"" vs ""medium"" makes. So I ate it. And I resented it.  It shouldn't be this hit-or-miss in restaurants that specialize in one thing and charge such a premium for it. And that it happened with David Burke's most precious cut of meat has made me realize that there's something wrong with the whole prime steakhouse restaurant model. Because I've ordered steaks at restaurants that don't specialize in steak but that really care about source and craft where this basic error never occurs. And I also grill steaks a lot at home. So I know that it isn't hard to cook a piece of meat right if you're conscientious about it.  So, sorry to Primehouse for singling it out for what's a common, if unconscionable, shortcoming of its category. But the Primehouse does enjoy a sort of first among peers status among steakhouses. And its special attention to, and marketing of, its sourcing and aging processes lead a diner to believe that equal care will be taken to ensure correct preparation. That even it can't get it right has finally made me realize that there's less care and craftsmanship behind the enterprise than I thought. So after too much expensive trial and error, I'm done with the steakhouse. It's the epitome of culinary overpromise/underdeliver.",0.9742,0.784,0.129,0.087,0.4679245283018867

They were not the best popovers but when you have the chance to have more, you can't say no! We ordered: 1/2 dozen of the east coast oysters from Rhode Island - They don't have much variety but its decent.  40 day ribeye - Medium Rare - This was solid medium rare indeed which is good because i like them pink/red throughout and not just towards the center. It had a good amount of fat and juice. It was big as well, I was struggling to finish my ribeye and unwilling gave the rest of my dish to my boyfriend.  Creamed spinach- More spinach than the cream which is a plus as I wanted my veggies. Most steakhouses have too much cream in their side dish where it overpowers the dish.  Mac and Cheese - This was the first time I ate mac and cheese and I went was incidentally surprised. What was that taste in the mac and cheese that made it sweet and not so cheesy. We guessed that they may have mixed sweet potatoes/yam into this dish to give it that golden sweetness and making it not so cheesy as a result.  We got the strawberry dessert that I do not remember what was in it.

I'm a big Rib Eye steak fan to begin with, so DB's is great for me.  The table shared two 55 Day steaks cooked Medium-Rare, Tempura Green Bean, Garlicky Spinach and Mac N' Cheese.  The steaks were great.  Cooked perfectly and with good flavor.  They really are a different quality than what I've had before (due, I'm told, to the salt dry aged process).  The sides were good too.  The beans were actually quite good and the mac n' cheese was quality.  I say spend a little extra money and go for the 55 Day steak. Dessert was the O'Banon Cheese, Hibiscus Ice Cream and Tanzanie Pecan Brownie.  All were good and made for a nice, light ending to a good meal.  The table next to us ordered the Lollipop Tree (which I saw David prepare on a Food Network show).  It looked amazing but not great for sharing amongst 4 people.  I'll be looking forward to that on my next visit.

I had been craving a really, really good steak for some time, and the $22 set menu seemed like the perfect opportunity to enjoy some high quality food. The cheese popovers that came out at the start in little measuring cups were tasty and super cute to boot. For my appetizer I had the lobster bisque with a lobster spring roll. I found the bisque to be creamy, smooth, and rich, though one of my friends thought it was bit bland. The whipped potatoes (creeeeamy!) and mushrooms that came as sides were flavorful and delicious, we all enjoyed them thoroughly. And then, the filet mignon! It was bit too well done (I ordered medium-rare), but quality, quality meat. Just what I needed to satisfy my meat craving. The brownie dessert pushed me slightlyyy over the edge, but it's always nice to end with a something sweet. The service was great, the ambiance and decor simple and elegant.

2011-05-04,4.0,"I was torn whether to give this place 3 or 4 stars.  As others have mentioned the service is excellent, attentive, knowledgeable and friendly.  The atmosphere is casual, comfortable and classy.  The menu is unique and diverse and generally offers something for everyone.  The wine and drink menu is also great. We shared everything and got a pretty good variety across the entire menu.  The tableside Caesar was excellent, one of the best Caesar salads I've ever had.  The Corndog appetizer sticks were also tasty and a nice start to the meal.  Our server suggested the 54(?) day aged steak, it was steak of the year 2009, since we are Ribeye fans and we went with his recommendation.   This is why I wavered on the star rating.  The steak was good but to me not as tasty as some other Ribeyes I've had in Chicago and significantly more expensive.  I think part of the reason was it was a relatively thin cut compared to others I've had here.  They also seem to let the meat do a lot of the talking and have a light hand when it comes to seasoning.  For an avid steak eater I think they would be more than satisfied and potentially say it's one of the best steaks they've ever had.  For me, since I don't eat steak all that often, I was looking for that really buttery, salty flavor normally associated with a steakhouse steak.  It was perfectly cooked and very flavorful with just the right amount of marbling but clearly was prepared so that the meat flavor was front and center.  If I were to order another steak there I would probably just go for the standard Ribeye and leave the extended aging to the red meat regulars looking for some diversity. We had ordered the Shellfish Collection as well and had I put more thought into it I would have asked that it be brought with the steak for  a bit of Surf & Turf action.  I didn't think of it but our waiter did and it was an excellent touch.  It is a good way to get a seafood option with the steak outside of the more direct choices available in the sides section and I think for a slightly better value. We also went with the red velvet cake can for dessert which wasn't the best red velvet cake I've had but it was nice it came out hot and fresh.  The cream cheese icing was excellent. In conclusion, the experience was really good and aside from the steak I would say was a 5 star experience.  Since it is a steak house though it's hard not to weight that portion of the experience fairly heavily.  I would be interested to try a different steak next time we went and see if it might be closer to what I was looking for.  Service, starters, seafood and dessert were all what you would expect from a fine, dining restaurant run by a world class chef.",0.9981,0.804,0.183,0.013,0.5640234059725586

Everything about it was very good but I wouldn't put it about any other nice steakhouse based on this visit. Don't get me wrong, it was very good...VERY GOOD...but not the god-like place that it was made out to be leading up to our visit. We started our meal with a pop-over (for free). A delicious beginning. We then got the foursquare checkin special which was dumplings. They were decent, but for free....WOOT!  On to dinner. We split a few sides. Mac and Cheese - GREAT Tempura Greenbeans - Meh Truffle Fries - Alright I had a filet mignon. It was quite good. A bit overcooked but that's my fault because I ordered medium-well. I know...I'm a peasant. Dessert was pretty cool. We got the cheesecake lollipop tree. Very unique presentation.

2011-04-25,3.0,"I went here with my boyfriend to celebrate our 3-year anniversary. If it were based on service I would give it a 5 star but the food was just OK. We started off with the foursquare check in special (shrimp dumplings) and the kobe corn dogs. I'm not a big seafood fan so the dumplings weren't my fav but I imagine they would be good if you liked shrimp. The corn dogs were good but not what I was expecting at all. They were glorified cocktail wieners battered and fried. Tasty but I wouldn't order again. On to the main event... When I go to a good steak house I want to be blown away with the most tender, melt in your mouth steak. I ordered the filet because that's my favorite cut of meat (lean and thick). I know that David Burke is famous for their Dry Aged Rib Eye's but that's not my style. I ordered mine au poivre (I love a peppercorn brandy sauce). I have to say this is the most unique ""au poivre"" sauce I've had. It wasn't your traditional brandy, peppercorn, cream sauce. It was more like a meat gravy with peppercorns. My steak was completely crusted in pepper. I love peppercorn crusted steak but I've never had mine quite like this. It was way too overpowering. The cut of the filet was really weird too... I think I got an end piece because it was shaped like a log/blob instead of a beautiful round cut. My meat was a little chewy and tough which it should never be when ordering it medium-rare. It was perfectly cooked but still chewy... something went wrong here.  As for the sides, we ordered the truffle fries, tempura green beans, and mac n cheese. The fries came highly recommended and I'm not quite sure why. They're thick steak cut fries with mild flavor and were a bit too oily for my taste. The mac n cheese was TO DIE for, and the green beans left something to be desired for. The portions of the fries and green beans were huge and of course the mac was pretty small.  To finish we had the cheesecake pops. They were very good and more than enough for 2 people. They also brought us out a complimentary slice of cake that said ""happy 3rd anniversary"" in chocolate on the plate. It was beautiful and really sweet. At the end of our meal I over heard our waiter telling another table that he makes the cellos for the restaurant and was about to launch his product nationally. I asked him about it saying that I loved limoncello and actually lived in Italy for a little while. He brought me out a sample of all 5 types he makes because he wanted my opinion on them. I thought that was so nice and I really enjoyed trying the different flavors he made! He was very attentive and a great server. Overall the service was great, the food was good, but not what I expect/want when going to a steak house. I miss my favorite places in Seattle for steak. I guess I'll have to keep searching for my perfect filet fix in Chicago! I would not recommend the food at this place but maybe that's because of the cut of meat I prefer...",0.9989,0.714,0.221,0.065,0.6232830687830688

I've been to David Burke's a few times already & enjoyed dining here..just never got around to yelping about it..until now!!!  Recommended starters: Caesar salad prepared table side..also the Wagyu Beef Sashimi served on a brick of Himalayan salt is awesomeeee. Ooh & I love those cheese popovers they serve in the all clad pots..they're so fluffy & crispy makes me wish they would bring a ginormous pot of them instead of just one. The lobster bisque is really good too, but I recommend going w/ a salad or the sashimi for starters b/c the bisque is really rich and kind of heavy so you might not have enough room for your steak! For my entree I went w/ the ""Steak & Eggs""...Filet Mignon w/ lobster scrambled eggs & caviar. The presentation was pretty awesome b/c the lobster scrambled eggs were served up in a big ostrich egg on top of a mini all-clad pot. The steak @ David Burke's is always juicy and fully of flavor & they don't douse their steaks w/ a bunch of different sauces. The dry aged steaks are very popular and sometimes they run out of certain steaks..the 55 Day Aged Ribeye seems to be one of the more popular ones, but I guess it makes sense since it was voted ""Best Dry Aged Steak."" For dessert definitely make sure to pre-order their signature dessert the ""RED VELVET CAKE in a can."" They serve it table side as well & they frost the cake w/ cream cheese frosting & serve it w/ vanilla bean ice cream. They even bring the egg beaters w/ the cake mix for you to lick haha.The cake is a lil' crunchy on the edges, but so moist & fluffy..BEST red velvet cake I've had hands down.

2011-04-24,3.0,"We made reservations really late on a Saturday night, so we managed to get seated almost immediately. We were asked to have a drink in the bar if we wanted, which is in the lobby of the James Hotel, and there was lots of room. We ordered drinks and the hostess from the restaurant stopped by and informed us that whenever we closed out our tab, we could come in and get seated. We were able to carry our drinks in. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and asked us what our preferences were, etc. The menu/restaurant is really for some type of a steak connoisseur (if they exist). They carry anywhere from 21 to 75-day aged. The waiter did his due diligence to educate us. We were served some type of hollow break/muffin which was tasty. We ordered pretzel-crusted crabcakes for appetizers. I must say I was impressed - 50 points for taste and 50 points for creativity. The crabcake looked like a piece of churro and was atop a mixture of peas and bacon, which was very good. The appetizer was good to share, not too much. We ordered two steaks for two people - which was way too much. We got a 55 DAY RIBEYE and the 35 DAY KANSAS CITY sirloin.  The ribeye was tender and excellent. It was marbled quite a bit but was really good cut. The sirloin was a big tough, probably because it was medium well. It had a really meaty flavor. The steaks were brought to the table and cut it and served us so we could taste both steaks. The sides were below mediocre. We ordered purple fingerling potatoes (off of the special) and asparagus. We ordered whipped potatoes much later, which were decent. For dessert, we ordered the Cheesecake Lollipop Tree, which came with 10 cheesecake lollipops with raspberry cream. It came in three flavors - dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate. All in all, a decent evening, but we wasted so much food, it felt like we could have ordered just half of what we did and still would have been ok.  I would probably go back, not sure yet.

Not hopped up on sugar and head a great, smooth texture.  Ordered the steak, mushroom and asaigo omelet with home-style potatoes.  The flavor was fantastic... but... the omelet was soaking in oil and the potatoes were very uninspired.   The jams that came with the toast were very interesting.  Pineapple-ginger... not a combo I would normally think to throw on the breakfast table but nice call David Burke!  The portions were huge.  Service was satisfactory.

2011-04-23,3.0,"In four words: overcooked steaks, overpriced wine.  I've been here a few times, and I have always received an overcooked steak.  Medium rare will come out medium to even medium well.  I was here recently with two other people, and all of our steaks were overcooked.  It is too bad, because the quality of the meat is very high.  Even with the overcooking, the flavor is still solid.  I have had the 55 day rib eye and some of the lower aged rib eyes, definitely go with 55.  Next time I am going to order rare and keep my fingers crossed for medium rare. The wine list is definitely on the smaller side for a steakhouse, and many of the wines are incredibly overpriced.  For example, a 2005 Silver Oak Napa cab is a bottle that will be $150 or $160 at any other restaurant.  Here, it is $215.  A 2007 Stag's Leap Artemis is usually an $80 bottle, here it is $127.  A 2007 Joseph Phelps is a $90 bottle, here it is $132.  And so on.  In short, the bottles are 35-50% higher than other restaurants.  Very weird and a little offputting.  Hey, I get that a restaurant is a business and needs to make money, but this feels like they are trying to take advantage of their customers. Pluses: great service, an excellent and knowledgeable sommelier, and very good sides, love those truffle asiago fries.  But when I go to a steakhouse, I go to eat steak and drink wine, and there are problems with both here.",0.979,0.843,0.124,0.033,0.5416172839506173
2011-04-23,1.0,"Our experience was mediocre at best.  My one star reflects a belief that one shouldn't pay $100 a person for mediocrity.  Maybe this place was really good a few years ago, but I don't get it. We had a 6:30 reservation on a Saturday night.  When we walked in there were about five hostesses talking with each other, apparently too busy with each other to notice guests arriving.  They acknowledged us and then proceeded to take us through the dining room to a small deuce located directly next to the curtains separating the dining room from the kitchen.  At this point the dining room was maybe 30% full; I would not seat guests at this table until all others were unavailable.  We asked for a different table and were shown to a booth where the upholstery was coming off (I uploaded a picture of this).  I took a closer look at our table and realized it was a plastic table covered with vinyl.  This would not normally be a big deal, but this is $100/pp. Our server was very friendly and immediately brought us a wine list and menu.   We ordered the wedge salad, the arugula salad, a filet, a 35 day KC strip, the baked potato gnocchi and tempura fried green beans.  Here are my thoughts. Popover bread - this was pretty good but I've had better.  No real complaints here. Wedge salad - this was our favorite.  A more modern take on an iceberg wedge. Arugula salad - arugula with pine nuts and smoked tomatoes.  I enjoyed the smokiness of the tomatoes with the peppery arugula. 35 day KC Sirloin - the steak was really crusty on the outside, and some parts of the crust even seemed gritty, like it came off of a dirty grill.    I could taste the gamey aged quality especially near the bone and it was different. European cut filet - again the outside was really charred and that flavor overpowered the rest of the steak. I understand that grass fed beef can be inconsistent, but I expected much higher quality of the steaks. Baked potato gnocchi - This was not the fluffy gnocchi I have experienced at other steak houses like BLT steak.    It was a very heavy gnocchi in a rich sauce. Tempura fried green beans--expected a light tempura batter, what we got was overcooked green beans in a greasy batter. In summary, there is nothing special about this place and the basic dishes aren't high enough quality to justify the price.",0.9777,0.854,0.1,0.046,0.4583965014577259

2011-04-17,2.0,"I really want to like this place and was torn between two and three stars, but at the end of the day it just falls short on all fronts in a town that has more its fair share of 5 stars steak establishments. We had a large party that was able to get a last minute Saturday night reservation at a decent time, which is a catch 22.  Glad we could get in, then again every other decent steak place was booked up well in advance.  The place has lost whatever character and buzz the dining room once had.  It seemed very quiet, lifeless and didn't have the atmosphere you're looking for on a Saturday night (by the end of our meal it seemed to be barely half full).  I have been to Burke's several times over the years, a handful of times when it first opened and I absolutely loved it.  I came back for their 22 course brunch (or some ridiculous number) a while back and it was a terrible experience (which seems like they agreed, as the brunch menu is totally revamped). The staff seemed to be dragging and the food just missed the mark course after course, so I put them in the penalty box for a while (just too many other options out there).  But alas, my procrastination and lack of planning ahead caused us to meet again.  We started out with the seafood tower and the ""five oysters"" (five different oysters topped with a variety of condiments).  The tower was pricey and didn't offer much, the shrimp, lobster and oysters were decent, but far from memorable or the freshest I've ever had.  The crab legs were almost inedible because they were so salty.  I thought I just got a bad one, but everyone had the same complaint.  I didn't love the oyster I tried with the topping on them (mayo/cucumber salad), the combination didn't do it for me.  Seemed like it was being different just for the sake of being different.  The wedge salad was good, but was a very text book version of the salad.  Now this may be where I went wrong, I've been on a steak/red meat overload lately.  So a few of us opted for lighter seafood.  The spice encrusted tuna had a weird texture on the coating and the spices did not go well with the tuna, it would have been better off plain (3 of us all agreed on this after sampling it).  As for plain fish, that's exactly what my salmon was.  It was good, but no better than average, or that I could do myself.  I guess that's what I get for ordering fish from a Steakhouse.  For the creativity and reputation that David Burke has, I expected more variation/originality to make the dishes more memorable and stand out from the crowd than they do. Service was spotty, I had to hunt down the waiter every time I needed another drink, they forgot a salad, just a few mishaps and I am usually not a stickler for service, but for a restaurant of this caliber/price point and not being absolutely slammed, I do expect better.  But to be fair, front of the house was very amicable and inviting. Bottom line, this isn't a bad restaurant at all.  Its decent and maybe I caught them on an off night or maybe they've seen their better days that are behind them now.  But there are at least half a dozen other competitors within a 6 block radius that are a touch cheaper, with a spot on menu and impeccable, consistent service that will keep me from coming back here anytime soon.",0.9515,0.8,0.113,0.087,0.5054117782378653

And then, if dinner wasn't amazing enough, Chris arranged for us to tour their meat aging cellar down in the basement (the very same one that you see on the food channels).  What an amazing experience.  You walk into a dimly lit, cool, dry room where the air is literally permeated with the smell of fine aging beef.  It almost made me hungry again!

The positive...Thanks to David Burke for offering a vegetarian option on the menu.  That was very much appreciated. The disappointment...We called in advance to let them know I'm a gluten-free vegetarian.  They assured us they would have things for me.  Generally, when we go to a restaurant of this scale, the first thing our server asks is who is the gluten-free vegetarian and then proceeds to tell me what options they have for me.  Our server made no mention of having prior knowledge of my gluten-free or vegetarian requirements.  There was a vegetarian entree of roasted veggies and gnocchi, so the gnocchi was out.  When he asked the chef what they could make to accommodate me, all he could come up with was a roasted vegetable plate.  Really?  That was the best he could come up with...something already on the menu minus the gnocchi?  They didn't even have rice, risotto, couscous or quinoa.  So my meal was a salad of raw vegetables, followed by a plate of cooked vegetables.  Gee thanks. Most restaurants of this caliber also serve gluten free bread.  But when  everyone else received a popover, I received nothing.  If they had no gluten-free bread, they could have substituted something else, so I didn't look like a misfit.  Most fine restaurants have a chef creative enough to do that, but not here.   I will most definitely not go back to this place.  Though I must say that all the carnivores at our table loved their meal.",0.9858,0.82,0.138,0.041,0.4045177045177045

2011-03-24,4.0,"I went to David Burke's Primehouse after reading about in Esquire.  Since I don't really put much emphasis on the atmosphere of a restaurant (unless it is obnoxiously loud or ugly) I won't comment much on this other than to say it is pretty modern and in my opinion unassuming. All I care about is what is on my plate and the value proposition of my money versus the quality of the food I am about to eat. That said, I found DB Primehouse steaks to be of exceptional quality and well worth the hefty prices. We had a couple of small glitches but otherwise a very good experience. A Malbec that was recommended at $58 bottle was thin, watery, and astringent. Had I not been with colleagues whom I was afraid I would embarrass I would have refused it. It was terrible. Then again, the only reason I would ever pay that much for a Malbec is because someone in my party requested it.  Should have known better and though the bartender reluctantly recommended it, I don't fault the restaurant (though it shouldn't be on their list). The second bottle that I picked was the ZD Pinot Noir which was a more popular choice among the group. I started with a handmade, table side prepared Caesar salad which was fantastic. If you get nothing else, get this. It is by far the best Caesar I have ever eaten combining a slight heat from the fresh garlic and mustard with the cool crunch of fresh romaine. Very well done especially with the fresh anchovy add-on. I was very happy. We also tried an oyster selection with mignonette and cucumber. Fantastic. Our mains ranged from lamb chops to ""steak and eggs"" to the dry aged bone in filet. I ordered the Kansas City cut but was informed that they were sold out so I changed to the sirloin. The ribeye cuts are featured but I am not a big fan of the fattiness of this cut so I passed. They also have a wet aged steak but in my opinion there is no comparison to dry aged steaks for Beefy goodness. All of our steaks were perfectly cooked to our liking and they tasted wonderful with the right amount of fat left on the edges to provide good mouth feel. Everyone was happy.  The popovers served were nothing great.  We had 4 sides which had mixed success.  Basil whipped potatoes were just fair and nothing special. Steamed green beans were overbooked and bland.  Creamed spinach was decent but didn't wow us. The star of the side show was the gnocchi with bacon and cheese which made our knees weak. For dessert, we chose the lollipop tree which was a nice treat to share among 5 people. Overall, it was a very good meal for about $110 per person including tip.  Steaks are definitely of high quality and are well aged and well cooked. Wine list is expensive but you can find a couple of decent deals. Service was friendly, hip, and unobtrusive.  If you are looking for the clubhouse feel of the Chophouse, this isnt it. But if you are looking for a very high quality beefy experience, you are in good hands here.",0.9984,0.716,0.215,0.069,0.5962128851540616
2011-03-21,3.0,"My husband and I bought the gilt city deal--4 courses with wine pairings and an amuse bouche/champagne pairing.  The staff could not have been nicer--our server was great, all the service was right on.  Our amuse bouche was some sort of steak tartare on a little garlic potato chip maybe...it was soooo good and we wanted more.  First course was a tuna tartare and a wagyu beef carpaccio.  Both were beautiful to look at but didn't knock our socks off.  The tuna tartare had very little flavor...needed salt or a squeeze of lime juice or something.  The beef carpaccio was ok, I've had better.  Caesar salad made tableside was really good. A lot of garlic but a really good salad.   We had a bone in (mignon maybe?) and a bone in new york strip, I think. I like almost all steak so have a hard time remembering what is what.  The filet was seriously charred on the outside and that was hard to overcome.  A slight char is good, a serious char/burn is not.  The new york strip had good flavor but wasn't amazing.  Truffle fries, sauteed spinach as sides and they were good.  Some sort of chocolate cake and zeppole donuts for dessert which were both good.  The wine pairings were very good and definitely worked with the flavors.  Overall,  a nice time and experience, but food wasn't all that I expected it to be.

2011-02-27,4.0,"[One year later...] Hi, all. It's been one year since I last visited David Burke's Primehouse, and it's been one year since I didn't eat meat at David Burke's Primehouse. But I've got fantastic news! I'm not on a seafood diet anymore. I'm on a SEE FOOD diet; every time I see food, I eat it. I don't know how it works, but dry-aging seems to be something of a miracle. I can't even explain it. We dined for lunch on a Monday afternoon. My girlfriend, who IS on a seafood diet, opted out of the red meats and ordered the Alaskan King Salmon, a dish that I devoured last year. It was a little lackluster and didn't do much for either of us. It was cooked beautifully, you can order it however you want, but there wasn't a ton of flavor. It seemed like it was just salt and pepper. Being on a see food diet, I ordered the 40 Day Dry Aged Steak Burger. It was delightful. Served with garlic spinach, crispy shallots, bacon mayo, and on a potato bun, this aged burger was perfectly done. I don't think I've ever eaten anything that was older than ten days old. By that time, the food usually has a few cultures of mold growing on it. Somehow, this burger didn't have mold...and that is why I am so impressed by this ""dry-aging"" process...and that is why I want a dry-aging room. Service at the Primehouse is...aight. Nothing to write home about but it got the job done. I wasn't wowed by the host staff or food runners, who push food carts btw, but our server was quite pleasant. She was attentive and didn't treat this baby-faced twenty-something any differently than her other older patrons who obviously had bigger waistlines and wallets than yours truly. Prices are top tier, but it's definitely worth one or two trips. I'm telling you, that dry-aging is something.",0.9938,0.822,0.158,0.02,0.4568452380952381
2011-02-26,2.0,"I really wish Yelp allowed star ratings for sub-categories as parts of the experience were very good, and others were quite disappointing.   THE GOOD:  My girlfriend and I chose Primhouse on a friend's recommendation and its high reputation.  We were also celebrating our one year anniversary.  Our friend was kind enough to call ahead and let the restaurant know.  When we were seated, the host congratulated us on the milestone and gave us each a glass of champagne.  FIVE STARS.  This really made the evening feel special. We both ordered from the pri-fixe menu, plus a mid range bottle of cab (Stonehall 2006 - $75, I believe).  The sommelier was very well informed, and very nice - and his recommendation was right on target.  AND he gave us the 2005 instead of the 2006.  I lack the vocabulary to adequately describe the wine, but it was very smooth and well paired with our meal. FIVE STARS. The sides for the main dish were solid - sauteed mushrooms and mashed patatoes.  Very flavorful, and a perfect addition to our steaks.  3.5 STARS. THE OK: The appetizers (I ordered the lobster bisque, she ordered the surf & turf dumplings) were good, but not great.  The lobster bisque had a dominating lobster taste where I prefer more subtle undertones.  The dumplings were ok. THREE STARS. The steaks (classic filet) were, again, good, but not great.  S&W, Gibson's, even Harry Carry's on Kinzie have far superior cuts.  I think, however, if we had ordered from something besides the Restaurant Week menu, that the steaks would have been better.  Nevertheless, I was disappointed. THREE STARS. For desserts, we had the creme brulee and the vanilla ice cream brownie.  The brulee tasted more like spiced pumpkin mousse than brulee. The brownie was small and just OK.  THREE STARS. THE BAD: The entry to the restuarant is poorly designed.  If more than two people are waiting in the area or talking to the host, the entrance is blocked and very cramped.  TWO STARS. We were seated at a booth.  Personally, I prefer a table because I like being able to sit closer to my girlfriend (and do not like sitting on the same side of the booth), but the booth can be more intimate.  Unfortunately, there is little rooom between the table and the booth (I'm skinny).  As a result, the backs of the booths were incredibly worn down to the point where you can see the interior foam.  This is clearly not in the character of a first rate establishment. ONE STAR. While the sommelier was excellent, our server was HORRIBLE!  He never once refilled our water, never poured our wine and maybe asked how are experience was once - until the sommelier stopped by our table toward the end of the meal and we politely commented on the service.  This is in stark contrast to nicer restaurants I've been to lately, including Piccolo.  ONE STAR - ZERO STARS IF THAT'S POSSIBLE. Total bill: $31 for pre-dinner drinks, $75 for the wine, $66 for the dinner - about $200 even with tax and tip (yes, I know I was a little cheap on the tip, but the service was bad). So, given the great wine, sommelier, the niceness at the beginning and ok food, why the TWO STAR rating instead of THREE?  The OK food combined with the horrible server ruined the experience - especially considering the overall cost and the fact that Primehouse is supposed to be a highend restaurant.  Very disappointing.",0.9633,0.764,0.136,0.1,0.5766570466570466
2011-02-26,2.0,"Came here to celebrate a birthday and I admit, we had some high expectations because of the other reviews. It was restaurant week so the menu was set up a little differently than usual - you could order some of the steaks a la carte but it was a limited selection. If you wanted to substitute a better cut of meat, there was an additional charge to the $33 prix fixed. Since the prix fixed only had a filet entree as far as steak options, I would assume most end up ordering another cut of meat - which pretty much eliminates any meaningful price savings so there is really no reason to eat here during restaurant week.  To start, we both ordered the surf & turf dumplings - the lobster dumplings didn't do it for either of us. It didn't have much flavor and since it was sitting in a citrus broth it was pretty soggy. The short rib dumplings were fried and tasted great so it made up for the lobster.  For entrees, I ordered the 55-day aged ribeye. I was happy with my choice, it was cooked perfectly and was flavorful. My friend ordered the 35-day aged Kansas City which he enjoyed. The steaks were accompanied by mashed potatoes (meh) and sauteed mushrooms.  We ordered the pineapple upside down cake and the tanzanie brownie for dessert. They decorated the dessert plate for his bday. The brownie was better than the cake but at that point we were so stuffed we didn't make much of a dent in either. Maybe I was too full at that point but neither of these desserts were anything to rave about.  The entire meal was served too quickly in my opinion. Usually when you are going to a nice steakhouse, you would expect to have a leisurely 2 hour experience. We were pretty much done with three courses in about an hour. I would have appreciated a little more time to digest after each course - it was a lot of food after all!  The ambiance was casual for a steakhouse. I thought the place looked dated for being an upscale steakhouse. The booths actually were a little dingy and I wasn't a fan of the thick maroon coverings on the table tops and the mirror border on the wall...it was a cheap look.  The service was fine in general but one of the male hosts I had spoken to the day before was pretty quick to cut me off and hang up with me when I was trying to confirm my reso and mention that it was a birthday. It wasn't even a busy time when I called so he needs to learn to multi-task better than that and give me 30 seconds of his undivided attention! I didn't realize that was too much to ask. That really is your first impression of a place so that should have been my warning that this place was going to be a letdown. If you can't give me the whole package, the steak, no matter how many days you aged it, just won't taste as good.  Overall I was unimpressed by our experience and it was certainly not worth the hefty price we paid for that meal. I will not be going back...there are too many other great steakhouses in the city.

2011-02-23,1.0,"Yesterday, I tried David Burkes ""Primehouse"" for Chicago Restaurant Week.  Where do I begin?? Well to begin with, the service was very good, friendly laid back but efficient without being too fussy; the service carts moving through the corridors, however, where annoying but I have no complaints about the service.  The food, however, is a different story altogether.  To begin with, the lobster bisque was nothing more than a cup of heavy cream and had barely any lobster. Bisque should be creamy, but not total cream that coats your palate like a gulf oil spill on a pelican. The only thing angry about the ""angry lobster"" dumplings is the patron after eating these things; bland and chewy with an under seasoned broth that only succeeds in turning the fried wrapper into a gelatinous dough ball. On to the entrées; while the salmon and steak were cooked to proper doneness; neither were evenly seasoned. Also, when you claim to be serving a filet mignon, you should know how to trim the loin properly. Both entrees cried out for a sauce. I understand that they are under pressure during restaurant week, but this is no excuse for serving bad food.  Finally on to the dessert; the chai crème brulee was clearly made AT LEAST one day before and refrigerated until the order was served. Because of this, any hope of a caramel crunch was dashed like the hopes and dreams of the farmers who sold the food to this place that it might actually be treated with respect. Would it have killed them to throw a little sugar on the thing and run a torch over it?? The alleged pineapple upside down cake was in reality nothing more than a pound cake with a few dried out pieces of sautéed pineapple thrown over it and was clearly placed on at just prior to service.  Anyone thinking of trying this place should save your money and go to Ponderosa; you'll get a better meal.",0.901,0.754,0.14,0.106,0.4524444444444444
2011-02-22,2.0,"For me, David Burke's has lost the appeal they once had. It's funny because reading the recent reviews from others who attended during Restaurant Week, it seems I'm not alone in this thinking. I went to Restaurant Week last year at David Burke's and was blown away by the food and the service...this year it was nowhere near the same. It's just overhyped now I think. Parking was $19 in the garage next to the restaurant. Curse you downtown Chicago parking! So we walked in for our 1pm reservation, and they asked us to take our coats. I said No thank you and got a funny look from the hostess...like what's wrong with you? Check your coat! Upon being seated, I saw no one around me checked their coats either so I don't see what the problem was. Also, they didn't say bye to us when we left. They were too deeply enthralled in their conversation. I'm a stickler for greeting and farewelling at restaurants.  The Restaurant Week fixed lunch menu is only $22 which is a good deal but I must say their offerings aren't as good as last year. Last year I was able to get their infamous Kobe Beef Sashimi appetizer which this year costs an extra $9 on top of their fixed menu. You only got to choose soup, salad or a Lobster and Short Rib dumpling as appetizer. Well of course I went for the Lobster & Short Rib app! It came with two pieces of each. Both were tasty but I liked the short rib a bit better. The beef had a little kick to it which I enjoyed. The shrimp had a strong spicy citrus flavor to it because of the broth. For my entree I got the burger which was very tasty. I love their burgers with the spinach and yummy sauce! However, I ordered my burger well done and it came medium. Not a huge deal because I'm not super picky but if I were that wouldn't have been a good thing with all that red!!! People who were very specific with how they want their meat cooked would have absolutely sent it back. The dessert was not good at all. I had the brownie which was dry and just did not taste good. I'm a chocolate obsessed person and I didn't finish my dessert. That's saying a lot if you know my chocolate feening obsession! Ah yes, I almost forgot the bread. It was overcooked and just not as good as I've had from them in the past. Fail. Our service was good, friendly waiter who was attentive to our needs. The burger and the waiter were what earned David Burke's two stars instead of one. Overall, I feel like David Burke's just tries to make it through restaurant week. They serve subpar food and just don't care. Why even do Restaurant Week then? Isn't the point of Restaurant Week to attract new patrons to their restaurant who will want to keep coming back? I know that's what other restaurants do and have achieved with me. David Burke's is going to drive people away with their truly mediocre offerings during Restaurant Week.

I had seen a food show that highlighted this place many months ago, that with my combined love of steak made me really want to eat here. My boyfriend heard me mention it and made a surprise reservation. We had a really early reservation on a Saturday. We had a show to catch so we were one of the first couples to arrive, but the whole place filled up pretty fast. Our server was fantastic, great mood, really friendly, and explained everything well. Even the bread was over the top (literally). They serve these ""cheese poppers."" It's cheesy bread served in this little tin popping out of the top. We started with the table side Caesar salad, I love when restaurants do this. It is fun to watch your food being prepared. It was a great salad. For entrees I had the 40 day aged bone in rib-eye and my partner had the salmon with gnocchi (he doesn't love steak as much as I do!). My steak was fantastic, cooked the way I asked, and even though it was quite large I finished the entire thing! I am pretty sure that I only gave him a bite! His salmon was very good also, but I think that if you come here you should get steak!  He had told them ahead that it was my birthday so they brought a complimentary piece of flour-less chocolate cake, decorated really pretty with my name written in chocolate on the plate.

2011-02-20,3.0,"Yesterday we went to David Burke's Primehouse for an impromptu lunch during Restaurant Week. It was definitely last minute, but why not? My friends had already decided so all I had to do was jump on the el. I've become a bit of a cynic when it comes to Restaurant Week, and our meal at db's didn't do much to dispel those feelings. We had a decent lunch, and at $22 for three courses, it's not bad value. But on an absolute level it's still not cheap and my our meal was just ok. Like all Restaurant Week specials, you get to choose three courses fixe prix. My three courses were surf and turf dumplings (lobster, short rib), steak burger, and pineapple upside-down cake. Other choices included a lobster bisque soup to start, fillet mignon for entree (or salmon or chicken) and a brownie for dessert. My dumplings starter was interesting, but somewhat uninspiring. The short rib barbecue was on a stick with a crispy coating. I really liked the the spicy asian sauce it came with, but the entire dish was kind of goofy without a lot going on. My steak burger was a little under cooked for my liking (maybe my fault for ordering medium?). It came with an interesting sauce, spinach and crispy onions. Had the meat been cooked more I probably would have liked the sandwich more, since the flavors and textures were pretty good. However, when I sneaked a taste of the fillet (that everyone else ordered), I knew how badly I was out-ordered. The fillets were small, but for lunchtime appropriate, and very tasty with great, lite seasoning. The entire table came with sides of mushrooms and mashed potatoes. Finally, after we already ate too much at 2:30 in the afternoon, our dessert course arrived. My upside down cake was better than the brownie, but somewhat dry. I enjoyed the sorbet, though it was strong and tart. David Burke serves great steak, as their name suggests. I'm not sure about the rest of the menu, and I don't have a good idea of the value since this was restaurant week (I'm certain the prices are up there). I'm still not sold on the restaurant week phenomenon, but that's probably just because I eat out too much and don't see the inherent value. It still is a great way to taste your way around the city for less than a normal meal. Anyway, I tried it again, and can still recommend that David Burke has great steaks.",0.9967,0.766,0.178,0.056,0.5726276742581091

We both had the lobster bisque and it was SO GOOD!  It is served with some fried lobster leg (reminded me of a tiny egg roll).  Huge junks of lobster too.  I had the pan seared salmon and it was fantastic.  Don't let the tiny piece fool you because it was super filling that I didn't finish it.  The meal also came with family style mushrooms and mashed potatoes...both were great.  I am bias though because i love mushrooms.  The man had the 40 Day Dry Steak Burker and truffle fries.  He liked it a lot and said the mayo was amazing.

Others scoff when a 'tasting menu' is asked to be altered but not here. We got in on the Gilt City tasting menu (4 courses with wine pairings and champagne when you arrive) and my only regret is only buying one certificate.  You'd expect with a 'tasting menu' to just receive small portions of the house higlights, nope. Full portions (to share) but more then enough!  The meal was phenomenal. We were seated, brought an amuse bouche of shrimp and scallop bruschetta and champagne, followed by the delight of warm pop-overs and sweet butter (three stars just for those!) Then the wine aficionado came to present our first course of wine and the waygu carpaccio with tuna tartar and left us to melt into the pieces of delicate cow sitting atop a rock salt block When it came to the salad course I informed our waiter we only needed one since the bf doesn't eat leafy greens and he said they'd figure something out for him. What came next was a delight beyond what I had expected: pulled pork quesadilla with a smoky flavor and salsa verde that would make Rick Bayless blush and steak tartar the first I've had that was well prepared and not overdressed with capers and an unnecessary egg topper. I had expected a soup or another pop-over to tide him through the course, this was above and beyond. Once we settled into a mild-food coma, the waiter came out with his cart of delights: 55-day bone in filet (prepared rare) and a bone in rib-eye (medium rare) sliced table side (Clouds parted, angels sang, my stomach danced and mouth watered in anticipated) and served with basil masked potats' and garlic spinach..both unnecessary accompaniments but well appreciated. It doesn't stop there, like every fairy tale, this too has a happily ever after, but this came in the form of a 5layer chocolate s'mores came topped with burnt marshmallow frosting AND mini-doughnuts that you fill yourself (First thought: please excuse me while I inject the filling directly down my throat and use the doughnut as a chaser..)

The place is a modern and swanky steakhouse, located inside a hotel.  Clientele seemed to be mostly made up of ESPN-loving, expense-account and business-suit types. Not very many vegetarian options at DB's (no shock there), a gnocchi was my only entree option, so I instead ordered three side dishes and created my own meal.   I ordered:  spicy glazed asparagus (so good! seriously the best asparagus I've ever had and a very generous serving of it), mac 'n' cheese (solid), and the classic baked potato (which wasn't classic at all, but rather unclassic mislabeled gnocchi that was pretty tasty).   It wasn't the most well balanced meal ever, but for $16, I was probably the cheapest date in the history of DB, and I managed to leave with a satisfied belly and a doggy bag. For an app: the crab cake, which wasn't a cake at all.  DB is apparently famous for his whimsical trickery-trickery.  Which is great, I guess, unless you really wanted an actual crab cake or a classic baked potato.  Anyway, the crab cake was just blah.  Really, not something I'd ever want again. For my beloved: they were out of the 75 day old steak, so he settled on a slightly younger slab o' meat and licked his plate clean.   The waiter brought us free dessert (so nice!!).  I feel bad poo-pooing something that was free - but it was the equivalent of nicely plated grocery store cake.  Not very good. DB's has impeccable service, damn tasty asparagus, and would be a great place to pick up a lonely business man.  I'd just skip dessert and wouldn't come in craving a normal baked potato.",0.9889,0.763,0.165,0.072,0.5683645183645181

To start, we had the jumbo shrimp cocktail and tableside Caesar salad.  These shrimp were definitely jumbo and very delicious, and the Caesar was top notch.  It was also presented nicely.  For the entree, we had the 55-day ribeye, which was also voted the best steak in 2008 by Chicago Magazine.  Yep, it was amazing.  I normally go for a filet mignon, so I am also looking forward to trying that next time.  However, if you like a good ribeye, this will probably be the best you have ever had.  I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong though.  Although we didn't need more food, we went for a few sides just to try them.  They were very good, but I STRONGLY recommend the ""classic baked potato"" dish.  It's not a baked potato - it's actually gnocchi, but it captures all the wonderfulness of a loaded baked potato.  I can't do it justice by trying to describe it.  It's amazing.  A little goes a long way - it's very rich.  Three of us shared one order, and that was plenty. If you enjoy wine, their sommelier is top notch.  She did not point out the most expensive wine on the menu, which in my opinion most of them end up doing.  She actually listened to me about what I wanted to drink and pointed out the perfect bottle.  We couldn't make dessert happen this time, but I look forward to trying to save room for the next visit.",0.9991,0.69,0.29,0.02,0.5355555555555557

This moderately-sized restaurant is located on the first floor of the James Hotel. Nice, classic decor and the wait staff (wearing jeans) was very attentive. Casual attire is more than enough. There is a small bar around the host as you wait for a table. The sommelier was knowledgeable with the wine he paired our meal. Got crowded when we left dinner.  The cheesy popover was over cooked. When the steaks came out, I thought it would be sizzling hot like other steakhouses, but the taste is unlike any other steaks I've had; very flavorful and nutty. The fillet mignon was tender, but rare as you got closer to the bone. The a la carte sides were a great compliment, but if I had to do it again one or two is plenty. The one knock is the price that's hard to justify to come more often.  But great meal overall  What we ordered: - 55 day rib eye - recommend - ""south side"" bone in fillet mignon - recommend - Truffle Asiago fries - recommend  - Stir fried mushrooms - too salty  - Mac N Cheese - recommend  When we went: - monday @ 6:15 PM  Will we return: - maybe to take friends who haven't tried and try the 75 day ribeye",0.989,0.834,0.154,0.013,0.5362373737373738

2010-12-29,3.0,"We ate here on Tuesday night shortly after Christmas.  We made an 8:30 reservation, and faced a short wait (less than 10 minutes) before we were seated.  While we were waiting we had a chance to look at the drink menu and the dessert menu and we got to soak in a bit of the atmosphere.  As other Yelpers have mentioned, DBPH does not have the typical steakhouse atmosphere.  The lighting is great, and the color scheme is really soothing. My main complaint is that the restaurant is showing some wear and tear.  The table coverings appear to be a leather/faux leather material that is a deep red color; interesting, but not really to my taste.  The booths in the back of the restaurant were really showing their age - in some places there were tears in the covering and the material from the seat cushion was showing through.  These aren't big issues, but at a restaurant where you are going to spend at least $39 (and probably a lot more) on every steak you order - well, you'd expect a bit better.   The service was a real high point for us.  Our server was very knowledgable, prompt, and managed to be attentive without being intrusive.  He made an excellent recommendation for a wine to accompany our steaks, and when I asked him for a recommendation about meat he suggested the KC Sirloin.  I was impressed by this if for no other reason than the KC is not the most expensive steak on the menu.  It isn't cheap, but at $55 it is $8 less than the 55 day Ribeye.  We started the meal with cocktails, and I tried the Peppery Monk.  Made with gin, cardamom, cucumber, and pepper, when I took my first sip I thought I made a $12 mistake.  However, this drink immediately grew on me.  By the third sip I was sorry that I was going to have to limit myself to one of these tasty little gems.  If you like gin and cardamom, then I would highly recommend one to start your evening.   We ordered the beef sashimi, and - as other yelpers have suggested - it is absolutely amazing.  The beef melts in your mouth.  The flavor is rich without being overpowering.  The aioli that is served with it is absolutely scrumptious.   We also ordered the caesar salad.  It is prepared table side, and you can ask for the server to add chili oil to give the dressing a bit of a kick.  It makes the dressing absolutely fantastic.     For our main courses we ordered the European cut filet (no bone) and the KC Sirloin.  I had never had a dry aged steak before, so I don't have much of a basis for comparison.  However, I really enjoyed my steak.  It was cooked to my liking (hot pink center) and the beef flavor from the dry aging was truly intense.  Dry aging may not be for you if you aren't used to it, but if you haven't ever had a dry aged steak I think you owe to yourself to try one.  My girlfriend was much less impressed with her filet.  It was slightly overdone.  Her steak came out with the same center (hot pink) as mine, but she had ordered her steak medium rare.  Candidly, the kitchen seemed to be struggling with preparing meat to the clients' satisfaction.  The table next to us sent both of their steaks back for additional cooking (they had ordered their meat medium and it had come out with a cool pink/reddish center).   We also ordered two side dishes - the spicy glazed asparagus and the parsnip hash brown with ricotta cheese.  I liked the asparagus quite a lot, but girlfriend wasn't a fan.  It is spicy and sweet (with sliced almonds on the top).   The asparagus was cooked perfectly.  I think that the presence of cilantro in the sauce was the major turn-off for my girlfriend.  The parsnip hash brown was much less successful.  It wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't memorable.  One positive for the side dishes at DBPH:  The portion sizes for the sides are very manageable.  The sides are $6 each or three for $16.  Two people can order three sides and finish them if you haven't filled yourself on the appetizers or if you are planning on skipping dessert. We did, in fact, skip dessert.  I would have loved to try the signature Red Velvet cake in a can.  Unfortunately, it serves 4 to 6 and we weren't interested in taking a lot of cake back to our hotel room.   For two cocktails, a bottle of wine ($75), a caesar salad, the beef sashimi appetizer, two steaks, and two side dishes our bill came to $260.  With tip we were over $300.  And, that's the rub.  I just didn't find myself having had a dining experience that was worth $310.  I would certainly recommend DBPH.  Let's face it, they are simply charging ""market"" prices for steaks, etc.  As long as folks like me (and maybe you, too) continue to pay these prices, the steakhouses will continue to charge them.  I just don't think that you'll ever find me walking out of a high end steak restaurant thinking that I've gotten good value for my money.  But, based on the food quality, DBPH is a very solid choice for steak if you are in Chicago.",0.9986,0.832,0.135,0.033,0.47897233201581024

My dad had about 5-6 specialties, most of which include the grill, and are basically variations of the same thing. Recipes escape him and salt and pepper are for idiots. His main standard is some cut of steak, canned french cut green beans, and some sort of potato. It's never good, but we suck it up and eat it. My mom requests that we don't complain because she doesn't want to cook. We oblige and eat steak, green beans and potatoes 3/4 weekends in a month.

2010-12-06,4.0,"I came here exclusively for the ""Cab and Cow"" lunch special that David Burke's serves every Friday in December. It's two glasses of Cabernet and two burgers for $15. Not a bad deal. I'd been to David Burke's a couple of times for dinner when it first opened. I liked it fine, but there are many other steakhouses in the city that do it better in my opinion, but for a lunch deal like that, I had no problem going back. When I initially saw the lunch special, I thought it was meant to serve two people, but as it turns out, they're only 3 oz. pours of Cabernet and 5 oz. burgers. A friend and I came in here foolishly thinking we'd only have to spend $7.50 each. Still, $15 a person isn't unreasonable for a restaurant of this caliber and we both opted to get the lunch special. I'm not sure if they change the wine and burgers every Friday or not, but on this visit, the wine choices  were fantastic  - I just wish I'd paid more attention when the server poured them. Just like at dinner, you're treated to a warm, eggy popover, brought out in a metal cup, and served with sweet butter and pink Himalayan sea salt. I could seriously make a meal out of these. The popovers almost warrant a trip here on their own. The burgers were two different preparations - one was done au poivre style and the other had truffle oil in the meat and truffle mayo on the bun. The bun for one of the burgers was perfectly cute and fit the size, but the other one was way too large by about 50%, so I'm not sure why they couldn't have used smaller buns for both burgers. I ended up cutting off a lot of the bun. Both burgers were cooked exactly as ordered. I omitted the brie cheese that came on the truffle burger. As much as I love brie, I don't think it has any place on a burger, especially a burger that already had a lot going on flavor-wise. The au poivre burger was unique and delicious, but had quite a bite to it from all the peppercorns; luckily I'm a fan, but it could have been too much for someone who likes pepper in smaller doses. The burgers are served a la carte, so we had to shell out some extra cash and split an order of truffle-parmesan fries. The fries were plenty to share and had just the right amount of truffle oil and parmesan; neither overpowered the other. All told, I couldn't finish both burgers as they were too rich, but I'm curious how they will change the menu up for subsequent Friday ""Cab and Cow"" lunch specials.

There was a ham entree on the menu, I'm not sure why, because they kept running out of it during the time we were there. One of us ordered the steak, and to our disappointment (for a steakhouse), it was not very good. Also, we had to ask for all the extra sides for the steak dinner that already came with the turkey dinner.  Bonus points for giving us to-go turkey sandwiches, which were very good the next day.  Overall, a good experience. I am not sure what I was expecting for Thanksgiving. I've been here before and the streak was amazing.

2010-11-23,3.0,"Once upon a time, David Burke's Primehouse had a lunch special called the ""No Bull"" lunch special where, for $25, you could get an appetizer, soup, or salad for the first course, a small steak with a side for the second, and a small portion of dessert for the third.  For varying additional cost, you could get a glass of wine and/or an upgrade on your cut of steak and it seemed like a very fairly priced prixe fixe option and a VERY delicious way to get lunch. Well, the fairy tale ended. To make matters worse, it ended exactly on the day I decided to try eating there - they changed the menu and the ""No Bull"" lunch is gone.  Now just the steak in isolation costs about $20. Maybe you get more meat, I don't know.  I don't really care. Fact stands, while the recession may be over, it's not over for those of us who have struggled with unemployment and limited income and we can't really afford much more than a pre-tax/tip 55 dollar lunch.  As soon as I cottoned on to the fact that the special was no more, I had to walk out. Granted, David Burke's is entitled to change their menu, but I sure as heck wish they'd thought to change their website as well.  See, I don't walk into restaurants blindly assuming things  - I had heard from a friend the lunch special was amazing and made a point to check the website to see if it was still going on.  The website said it was, thereby misleading me into going in there with an empty stomach and high hopes for an affordably awesome steak lunch and leaving with my stomach filled with nothing but shame. It was embarrassing and irritating. I WANTED to givet his place 5 stars, but unfortunately, I didn't get the chance. I was humiliated enough to give it 1, but everyone there seemed pretty polite and the food smelled good at least, so I'm trying to be fair here.  That 3 is a gift considering I was robbed of the opportunity to really experience David Burke's in the manner I'd hoped and believed I'd be able to do. Just a simple change on the website BEFORE rolling out the menu would have circumvented this issue entirely, but unfortuneately, they didn't.  It left me with a sad and steakless experience and a bad taste in my mouth.",0.9803,0.731,0.16,0.109,0.559531746031746
2010-11-22,5.0,"Holy Christ. Went here for lunch this past summer with an old high school friend of mine. He's a huge foodie, and so I take his lunch recommendations seriously. I was in town for a convention, and the expense account was itching to be abused. This place blew my mind.  We both got the Prime burgers, with a really tasty (and expensive) bottle of beer. I forget the beer, as it was good, but not stunningly good. The burger overwhelmed everything. The popover you start with, pretty good. Not bad at all.  But my god. The Prime burger.  First of all, this is not any burger that you've had your mouth around. It is made with steak trimmings, and therefore the meat is chunked. Not ground. You just get these small chunks of dry-aged steak meat that have been shaped into a patty and grilled. It's like someone cut up a steak for you, and then put it in between two pieces of bread. So like a burger, but IT IS NOT YOUR DADDY'S BURGER. The juices that run out when you first bite into it... so perfectly delectable. Flinty and complex, but savory and meaty. Like great steak meat. And then the melted blue cheese just accentuated the 40 day aged meat. And the bacon mayo was actually bacony and delicious. The toasted potato bun was perfect, absorbing much of the juices, but not getting overwhelmed.  I could speak for paragraphs upon paragraphs about the asiago truffle fries that the burger came with, but let me just say that they were phenomenal. Phenomenal.  I would like to point out that this lunch was the day after I had dinner at Oprah Winfrey's personal chef's restaurant (Table Fifty-Two). I would take this meal hands down. And I really loved Table Fifty-Two. EDIT: I forgot to mention. The burger + fries were $12 total. TWELVE DOLLARS. You know what twelve dollars buys in New York? A Happy Meal. Maybe that Happy Meal is supersized. But it's still from Mickey D's. The Prime burger for lunch is a deal and a half. I would move to Chicago just for this burger if I didn't hate being cold for six months out of every year. If I could give more stars, I would.

Perfectly charred crust on the outside and perfectly cooked medium rare. Top sides included the creamed spinach, mac 'n cheese, foi gras, and basil whipped potatoes.

2010-10-31,3.0,"I saw David Burke on a food show on television and decided this was where we would dine our next time out.  We had a 7:45 pm reservation on the eve of Halloween.  It was a busy evening and there were a lot of guests from the St. James Hotel milling around the very tiny bar.  We were told we would be seated within 15 minutes (at 7:30) so we ordered drinks at the bar.  The bar tenders seemed overwhelmed but were attentive.  My girlfriend ordered a limoncello and the bar did not have it.  They had a grapefruit mixed limoncello and it was pretty good.  I had a great Grey Goose Cosmopolitan.  The hubbies had Citron on the rocks and Tangaray and tonic--all drinks were fine. We were escorted into the main dining room, which was cramped and crowded, over to a booth.  The booth was comfortable for 4 adults but I don't think anyone else could have fit in.  There were large parties, with young children, which surprised me on a late Saturday night.  No problem, however, because the children were well behaved. We ordered two salads for appetizers and a large bottle of Malbec to go with our steaks.  My girlfriend specifically ordered a well done filet.  I ordered a medium filet with the crab legs, my husband ordered a medium well with the crab legs and my girlfriend's husband ordered the 45 day, aged strip steak at medium rare.  I ordered some spinach and my husband ordered the butternut squash, and my girlfriend's husband ordered the mashed potatoes. Everything was all right but not the greatest.  The popovers were burnt, and not enough butter was left for four people, either.  We had to ask for more butter and I asked for a popover that was not burnt.  The lobster mashed potatoes that came with the filet and crab legs were soupy and not hot.  My steak was also more like well done than medium and had more bone on the filet than the actual filet. My husband had no complaints but his steak was definitely larger. We were very surprised to see my girlfriend's filet arrive and it looked more like medium rare.  She cut into it and sent it back. When it came back it looked like someone threw it on the ground and stomped on it.  It looked like road kill--I am not kidding, either.  But, she likes here meat well done and that's about what you get when you send a steak back. Her husband's steak also was not medium rare, but he ate it, anyway. I was so disappointed in the creamed spinach.  It was luke warm with creamy goo, stuffed with uncooked tough spinach leaves.  The squash was also way too sweetened for my taste so I did not follow up on a helping. We could not decide on dessert and the waitress took it upon herself to serve us three different desserts on the menu--all gratis, since she could see our meal was a disaster. Would I go back again?  Not if it was up to me.  There are better steak houses in Chicago.  Ruth Crist, Gibson's and Morton's would have been a better meal for the amount of money we spent.  Joe's Stone Crab also has good steaks. However, one thing we all agreed:  At least we could carry on a conversation and not have to shout.   So, I give it 3 stars for the desserts A+, atmosphere for conversation A+ and just ok fare. I wonder if Mr. David Burke was even in the kitchen?

For appetizer, we had the beef sashimi, it was just ok. The caesar salad was great, I ordered it with the crab croutons. It was an expensive addition (5 dollars for 4 pieces) but it was worth it.  For main course, we had the 35 day Kansas fillet and the 40 day aged rib eye. They were just ok. What made them great was the steak sauce that they gave us. The smoky steak sauce tasted really good with the steak.  For the side, we got mac and cheese, mushrooms, and onion rings, they were just ok too.  For desert, since it was our anniversary, they have us a free chocolate cake with marshmallow at top and ice cream on the side. It was good but I still wanted the red velvet cake.

Our party of four was seated dead center of the room, so it was very easy to spot the waitress or vice versa. For us, service is as you'd expect at a fine dining restaurant - semi-attentive. Our waitress was serving tables on the other side of the room so I don't blame her for being non-existent throughout our dinner - so long as she was there when we needed her. Our waitress took her time to explain the menu, and recommended the pre-seasoned oysters, and even offered to take it off the check if we didn't like it... tempting~ but we really did like like it :) It has a very different flavor than the usual tabasco & lemon juice oysters I'm used to. What I liked is that behind all those flavors, you can still tastes the fresh oysters... what a great way to start the night off. Just as everyone else has been saying, we can attest that the sashimi beef was EXCELLENT (albeit un-filling). The thinly sliced wagyu beef rested atop a block of Himalayan rock salt, making for an excellent appetizer to both our tummies and our appetites.

The quality of the steak is as you'd expect, but there's really nothing extraordinary about the flavor or taste. Similarly, the side dishes were on par with what we had expected, and nothing more. I found it slightly odd that the plates are not presented sizzling hot as other steak restaurants often do. Also, in a rare oddity, their generous portions means the steak will most likely cool before you get to finish it. Finally, the sweetest part about dinner was the desert (pun intended). Because chocolate makes me happy, we asked for something along the lines of a chocolate lava cake. And even though it wasn't on the menu, the waitress recommended a catered desert usually served to hotel guests - a chocolate layer cake with a marshmellow topping.

2010-10-04,5.0,"David Burke's is my new favorite steakhouse in Chicago (and i've been to most of them).  I loved the beef carpacchio, which was served on a himilayan salt rock.  My table-side caesar was fantastic.  My fiance got the 55 dry aged ribeye and couldn't stop moaning (awkward).  He said it was the best steak he's ever had and from the bite I had, I woudl agree.  I actually had the filet, which I believe is the only non-dry aged steak, but was absolutely fantastic.  We tried the dougnuts for dessert and had a ton of fun filling them with the different options.  I just can't say enough about this place.  It's fantastic.",0.9778,0.77,0.23,0.0,0.620855614973262
2010-10-04,5.0,"As the waiter removed our plates and before we ordered dessert, I literally said to my wife ""Wow, that was one of the best meals I've ever had"". And now a few days later, I am still thinking about this meal. It was THAT good.  The wife and I went to Chicago recently and after looking here on Yelp for steakhouses, we decided to give DBP a try.... and boy am I glad we did.  Made a reservation for 7:45pm and we were immediately seated when we walked in. Restaurant wasn't full but the tables were probably 80%-90% occupied.  We decided to forego and wine that night... the wife wasn't feeling 100% so she got soda and I opted for the Diego Mojito. Boy was it strong... Between a lot of rum and a lot of lime, it was certainly worth the $12.  For appetizers, in addition to the complimentary popovers, we got the waygu beef sashimi, the kobe corn-dogs, and the lobster spring rolls. They were all FANTASTIC. From the presentation, to the portions, to the taste, to the accompaniments... it is an understatement to say that I was really happy were all our choices.  For entrees I got the Filet Mignon-medium and the wife got the Gnocchi. She wasn't that impressed with hers but did say it was good. Mine... well mine was probably one of the best steaks I've ever had. I know, I know... some people think a Filet isn't the best cut to get. But for me, I'm lazy and I don't like dealing with bones or too much fat. So, I always get the Filet.  And this Filet, well it was outstanding.  A little charred on the outside, nice and tender on the inside. My wife usually never likes steak and even she was amazed at this one.  For sides, we got the Truffle Fries, Onion Rings, and the Parsnip Hash. The fries and onion rings were pretty standard. Nothing exceptional or bad. But the bacon mustard that came with the onion rings was one of the most flavorful and tasty condiments I've ever had. I miss that bacon mustard.  I did not like the hash that much... had 1 bite and left the rest.  For dessert, the wife had the pecan brownie and I had the apple cobbler. We both agreed that they were good but nothing great. Next time, we are going to opt for different desserts.  I am sad. Sad that I am now hundreds of miles of away from this place that served me such a memorable meal. Sad knowing that I won't be back to Chicago or Primehouse anytime soon. Sad that my time here only lasted 2 hours.  I can't wait to go back!!!!",0.9879,0.767,0.147,0.086,0.5664772727272728
2010-10-03,5.0,"I came here for my 30th birthday celebration. I was not disappointed. At first, wait service was slightly inattentive - one of my friends had to wait forever until he finally got water. This was partially our fault as well though because our party trickled over to our table at various times. Our waiter was really cool. He ran through the menu for us, telling us about Prime, their bull that they purchased for around 250k. This fella is responsible for all of the beef in the restaurant. Good job, Prime! Keep up the good work! The wine service was excellent. A sommelier helped us out with our wine selections. Although I didn't like the dinner wine,(more our fault for not rejecting it), the appetizer wine was pretty good. Instead of bread, they serve popovers as the pre-dinner snack... they were ok. Nothing to rave about in my eyes. For an appetizer, I had the Wagyu beef sashimi served on a Himalayan salt block. The presentation was beautiful. The meat was well marbled and the sashimi was quite good. I also had tastes of the bacon skewers and the foie gras. If you like bacon at all, you must get the skewers... they were phenomenal! The foie gras was very interesting, it literally melted in my mouth. Tasty. I also had a very large piece of shrimp cocktail. Nothing too special but not bad either. Also, the table made Caesar salad is excellent! While clearing off the appetizers, server spilled some maple syrup on one of my friends' jacket. What the hell!!! Their response was very impressive though. They immediately brought club soda and more napkins to dab out the stains and then they brought a dry cleaning form so that she could get her coat dry cleaned for free. Excellent attention to fix their mistake. The main course. I was looking forward to this. I had even gotten a dry aged bone-in ribeye ""comparison"" steak earlier in the week at Harry Caray's so that I could judge the difference (I think theirs is aged about 14-21 days). I had the 55 day dry aged bone-in ribeye medium rare and it did not disappoint. It had a meatier flavor and the fat that was marbled into the cut seemed to melt in my mouth. The meat was tender and juicy. It is also grass fed and hormone free. Really really good; it blew the comparison steak out of the water flavor-wise. It is a big cut of meat, so be prepared to get really full. As for the side dishes, the fries are really good as is the asparagus.  We also got a tour of dry aging room. Very interesting tour for any steak lover. It was stacked full of meat in various stages of aging and the room has a wall of Himalayan salt bricks that give the meat a little bit of extra flavor and help keep things more sterile.  It was an expensive meal but the quality and devotion to their food shows. What a great meal to go along with a great night!",0.9979,0.771,0.188,0.04,0.6074229691876751

2010-09-27,4.0,"I am still kicking myself for not being more hungry that day... Meat is my thing and it still hurts my soul that I wasn't able to fully enjoy the meal. But usually, if I'm not hungry, I don't eat and will wait until I am hungry again to eat so the fact that I was even able to eat really says something about how delish everything was. Ok, for starters, drinks -- green tea nirvana was def for tried and true fans of green tea (and probably alcohol too), I enjoyed it but I could definitely see how people would not care for it much. The lychee cocktail was much more likable though a tad on the sweet side. Beef sashimi was awesome. I've never had beef sashimi before (on purpose, at least. I *have* accidentally undercooked meat on several occasions) so it's hard to compare but it really was fantastic and I do enjoy that it sits on a big block of salt. Somehow, this makes me feel better about it, as if the salt was preserving it a little bit and deterring bacterial growth. Again, wasn't too hungry, so got the Cubbie sirloin -- nice and appropriately tiny, just what I wanted. I did peek over at my date's aged-75-day medium rare steak and it did not look overly different from my rare steak though I suppose the size factors in as well. I also did a little more than peek over at the 75-day steak and tried it .. my first bite was delicious, but after returning to my 21-day-aged steak and going back to the 75-day, it was just a bit too ... gamey?  There was also some mac and cheese there. I didn't want to waste potential stomach space that could be given to meat on this so I just tried a little bit and it didn't wow me. We ended up leaving quite a bit of it behind. I originally didn't want dessert but was told that the cheesecake lollipop tree was really something special. I love all the components -- cheesecake, lollipops and trees -- I had to try it. Soooo worth it. I bitched and moaned in between every lollipop about how full I was, but the minute I ate it, I didn't regret it at all. I think it would be worth it to go back just for the cheesecake lollipop tree, that's how good it was.  Oh and our waiter was kind of a really cool guy.

We ordered two brunch boxes (little bull and shells), a farmers egg white omelette, a 40-day dry-aged prime steak burger, a Benny burger, a Caesar salad, and two 28-day dry-aged ribeye steaks (one with a side of asparagus). Though I didn't actually try the Caesar salad ($11), one of the servers proceeded to prepare it table-side in a theatrical performance. All of the ingredients were already in a bowl except for the dressing, which gives the diner more flexibility in what to opt for (e.g., anchovies or not?). The 28-day dry-aged ribeye steak ($43) was well-flavored, probably thanks to the Himalayan salt they use for aging the steaks. And it wasn't dry at all, unlike the ribeye we had the night before at the Ritz-Carlton hotel. But I'm not sure I'm willing to pay over $40 every time I want a steak. The prime steak burger was the best deal out of everything we ordered ($10), but the truffle asiago fries that came with it were a bit disappointing to me. They did come out perfectly crispy, but I was expecting the cheese to be more integrated with the fries, not just an afterthought. (You also have a choice of what cheese to put on the burger even though the menu does say mozzarella. I picked cheddar.) The seven of us made it out alive but almost $240 short (after tax and included tip). The verdict: Burke's is good, and there's a reason you're paying a premium for these steaks.

2010-09-09,4.0,"Perhaps I just over hyped this steak in my mind before coming here, but based on the reviews and my knowledge of beef, I thought the 55-day aged rib eye was going to blow me away.  It didn't.  However, I will say it was one of the better rib eyes I had, given the flavor and the fact it was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  Points for the cooking.  The one thing about this steak is that it comes out sort of cold - not on a hot plate like other steakhouses, and the steak itself was just warm.  Not my favorite way to eat a steak, but I guess everyone has their own preferences.  If I come back here again, I will probably try their bone-in sirloin. In terms of the sides, the fries were the best.  The mushrooms and spinach were very plain.  I thought the best part of this meal came in the beginning - their bread is very unique (I don't know how to describe it, but it tastes similar to a Yorkshire pudding), and their appetizers are very good (try the scallops).  I thought the lobster bisque was ehh - the lobster egg roll that came with it was delicious though. The service here was admittedly not 5 stars, but they did put in a very good effort in terms of trying to make up for their mistakes.  We ended up having to wait about 15 minutes (even with reservations), and they compensated us for the wait with free champagne.  Later on in the meal, they forgot to bring us one of our appetizers (not such a huge issue since we were so full anyways), and also forgot to bring us one of our drinks.  Also, one of the sides we received was not the one we requested (ended up being good because we got to try their french fries).  I appreciated the fact they owned up to these mistakes and provided us with dessert on the house - however, if I come back here again, I would hope that the service would be flawless (especially at this price point).

(quite impressive). opted for the atalon cabernet.  it was very good. i got the wagyu beef sashimi and my dad got the crab cake for an appetizer.  the wagyu beef was buttery and had an amazing texture to it. the mushroom chips provided a very nice crispy contrast to the fatty beef.  the truffle mayo (although orgasmic) was way too overpowering to eat with the beef. i may be in the minority here but i just think that it killed the flavor of the beef. in the end the appetizer was a foodie's dream. even if it had to be eaten in layers to appreciate the interplay of flavors. the crab cake must have been delicious (and from having tried it at david burkes NY restaurant back when it was david burke & donatella) im sure it was because my old man didnt even offer me a single bite.  for the entree we both ordered the 40 day ribeye with the foie gras supplement. it was unlike any piece of meat i have ever eaten. it was as the menu suggests: intense beef flavor. not very juicy but packed with flavor. a meat lovers dream. the foie on the other hand was a let down. very small portion (very thin as well and super greasy). probably would not order the foie again.  the steak more than made up for the foie debacle, however.  it really was the most unique tasting piece of meat i have eaten. delish. for the sides we got the mushrooms, asparagus and truffle fries. truffle fries were very tasty--like most truffle fries out there, the mushrooms were woodsy and earthy and great and the asparagus was perfectly cooked and the lemon rind and niçoise olives provided a great tart/salty 1-2 punch.  so the dinner was great.  the service was good (started off real strong but as the night progressed--and the restaurant got busier--it started to wane. also was informed that there was a swiss chard side that turned out to be untrue :'(  but i havent even mentioned the best part of the night! we got a tour of the meat cooler. a/k/a: the salt mines.  it smelled so damn good i never wanted to leave. they are trying to dry age everything down there: prosciutto, duck skin, ground chuck and even a pineapple! it was a very cool experience. and on the way to the cooler we saw the madness that was the kitchen. very cool. so in a city filled with so many great steak places i say that this place finds a way to stand out. it should be on any meat eater's radar.",0.9981,0.796,0.172,0.032,0.6308697764820215

The table side caesar salad was pretty good, and they make it in front of you and you get to choose your level of spiciness (never had a spicy caesar salad before, it was pretty good). The steaks were cooked perfectly, we got a kansas city and a new york sirloin.  Very nice crust and perfect pink juicy middle, however, they did lack a bit of salt or something.  But very good nonetheless.

He is by far the best they have and will make your DB experience fabulous. I go here often for work lunches and he now remembers me and welcomes me back. I can't tell you how much of a difference that makes. A few things food wise- skip the Las Vegas Strip Steak. It is too thin to be cooked under medium, medium rare if you're lucky. If your steak is cooked incorrectly make sure to tell them, they will always make it right.

2010-06-19,5.0,"There aren't enough good things to say about David Burke's Primehouse.  I went here for dinner on my 21st birthday. Every aspect of the dinner was well-coordinated and delicious. First, the service was outstanding. The waiter got me started in narrowing down the wine selection (I remembered a red I had enjoyed while in Spain last summer). I found the wines from that region, and from there, almost seamlessly, the sommelier came in and explained each of the riojas to me in great detail. Despite the fact that it was my 21st birthday, making me relatively inexperienced when it comes to wines, and that I look 14-ish, she was not condescending and instead approachable and helpful. And the wine was a wonderful, moderately priced rioja that the whole table enjoyed. As far as booze is concerned, I also drank the Mojito Diego, which was overall good. The foam at the top was creative and I loved how sour it was. The rest of the drink, although fresh, was a bit too strong for my lightweight tastes. When it came to food, I really didn't even know what to order for a while, because everything looked fantastic! I settled on the surf and turf dumplings, but that was a mistake. The shortrib dumplings (2 surf, 2 turf) were not very flavorful at all - all I tasted was fatty beef. The lobster dumplings were marginally better but the lobster bone jutting out of the dumpling (making it more like a modified lollipop) was a bit weird. For what it's worth, the tableside caesar salads were well received, and tableside anything is pretty cool. I got the filet for my main course. Good life choice. It was huge, so I didn't finish it, but it was the perfect amount of tender and flavorful. My cousin noticed a hair in her salad, so they gave her a variety of steak accompaniments with her steak, and I tried them. They were all excellent, save for the blue cheese, which I didn't try because I hate the stuff. The peppercorn sauce used for au poivre preparation was fantastic - a good addition and not overwhleming in a way that would take away from the steak. But seriously, the steak (mine was medium) was fantastic, a perfect mix of tender in the middle and grilled (not charred) on the oustide. I liked the birthday cake decently enough, but I'm not a huge chocolate cake fan in general. Overall, the service was above-and-beyond, and while my appetizer in particular was a misfire, the overall package of food and service was excellent. All in all, it was a GREAT way to celebrate a major milestone. (And I just remembered that instead of bread, everyone gets a popover. It is as delicious as you are imagining it to be. Flaky, buttery, airy, with a hint of asiago...going to go drool now...)",0.9986,0.747,0.22,0.033,0.5609767025089605
2010-06-17,5.0,"David Burke's is one of the top five dining experiences of my life. From the Valet people, to the waitstaff, it was top notch. They made my birthday dinner a night that I won't soon forget.    Our server was wonderful. She took the time to explain the aging process of the steaks and what we should look for from each cut. She helped me pick out the most delicious steak I have ever devoured. All of the cows that they get their meat from are sired from one, genetically perfect bull. The steak was then dry aged for a total of 40 days. OMFG!! I'm getting hungry again just thinking about it.   We started off with a strange but delicious appetizer. We ordered bone marrow that was served on Texas toast that was smothered with grilled, carmelized onions. This seemed way too weird for us not to order. All of the ingredients went together perfectly. It was delicious.   My entree was amazing. The only bad part was the anticipation. The description of the steak that our server gave us had me as jittery as a 6 year old on Christmas morning. And then, out of nowhere, I saw the cart approaching our table. It felt like the opening of a Stones concert when the lights go down and you hear Keith play the first few Riffs of ""Brown Sugar"". It's the anticipation of something wonderful about to happen.   My first look at this Mona Lisa, of all steaks left me speechless. Those of you who know me realize how rare quiet moments around me are. It almost looked too good to eat. My first bite was pure bliss. The steak literally melted in my mouth. The fat was even delicious. Carolynne also sampled this dreamy-delight of meat. She liked it so much that her eyes literally rolled back in her head on her first bite.   We ordered a sampling of side orders that I completely ignored until I was done with my steak. The Potato Hash was wonderful. It was covered with Chorizo and Goat Cheese. There was also a corn dish covered with a home made Salsa and a small, tasty dish of Gnocchi that was delicious as well. But the star of the show is the steak. It may be the single greatest thing that ever clogged my digestive tract.   After a 20 oz steak, I actually had room for desert. I don't know how they found out, but the staff at David Burke's brought me out a piece of cake for my birhtday. Carolynne had also ordered the mini-doghnut desert that they are known for. I have no idea how I did it, but I actually ate half of the cake slice they bought me. The desert's were amazing, but after all this food, I was in desparate need of a pillow.   The Bottom Line on David Burke's is this: I can't think of anyplace  I would rather go for a special occasion. Is the meal pricy? Yes, but you get what you pay for times two. If you are looking to treat yourself or someone you love, I can't reccomend this place enough. The place is First Class from head to toe. On a scale from 1-10 the food is a 20, and the staff is wonderful. You may not be a king, but David Burke's will make you feel like one, if only for one night.",0.9986,0.79,0.18,0.031,0.5785869903516963

First up, you have to order the bone marrow.  Trust me on this.  Its is served with Texas Toast and onion marmalade.  You spread it on like jam.  But unlike jam this stuff is savory, delicious heaven.  You will understand your dog's love of bones after trying this dish. Next you want the dry aged steak.  Get as aged a steak as is available and that you can afford (the night we were there the only one offered was the 40-day).  Aging the steak changes things in amazing ways.  There is a beefier flavour, there is a tenderness that practically makes the meat melt in your mouth - even the fat is delicious (and I normally hate the fat!) The steak was Andy's dish, I ordered the salmon salad which was raw salmon with chopped egg, potato, greens and mustard vinaigrette.  I also got the Surf & Turf Dumplings, which was four dumplings - two were a mildly spicy lobster the other two were shortrib.  Lobster in dumpling form?  Um, yeah...fantastic.  Then we got a medley of sides - one was the potato hash (omg, so delicious with a topping of dates and goat cheese), then a chipotle creamed corn, and swiss chard gnocchi (so awesome and I practically ate the whole damned thing myself). Oh and the popovers they bring you in little measuring cups?  Probably the best bread I have ever had brought to me at a restaurant.  Airy, light, a hint of cheese...yum, yum, yum.  But the great things about the evening was at the end.  The server overheard me say to Andy that it was his birthday.  They brought out this amazing chocolate cake and ice cream dessert for him and we never even asked for it! Beautifully presented too, with a little chocolate bull lollipop and ""Happy Birthday"" written on the plate in chocolate sauce.  I had the donuts, which are a MUST.  Tiny, warm cake style donut holes that come with little bottles of fillings - we got a caramel (OK), a custard (omg!) and an apple ginger that tasted exactly like apple pie (OMG!)  I would come back simply for those.  The interior is sleek and modern without being pretentious.  The waitstaff was extremely pleasant and attentive.  This is a place you are going to want to come to again and again.  And honestly I am wondering when *I* can go again because there are so many interesting things on the menu (as well as dishes we saw being brought to other tables) that I am intrigued for more.",0.9985,0.783,0.195,0.021,0.6015262515262515

2010-06-11,5.0,"Superior steaks and best overall Chicago dining experience the weekend I was there. 4.75 stars.  Cost to worth it rating: 3 (aps around $10-15, regular steaks in the $40s)  Return worthiness: YES  Eve award: best steak I've had, most fun dessert, best cellos  Highlights:  - Au poivre steak: my 40 day bone in ribeye could stand on it's own being the most tender rib eye I've had, but it excelled with the peppercorn crust. Being a pepper fan that was so amazing I could bow down to it. Top that with the slightly sweet brown pepper sauce, and this thing takes you over the roof. Btw the hub paid the extra and got the longer aged one, but we actually preferred mine.  - Filler up yourself donuts: these variations between a donut hole and a beignet were fantastic on their own, but the fillings made them unique with the fun factor they added. Puffy paint-like containers were served along with it you could squeeze. Whether it was caramel, apple ginger, or cream, they all went swimmingly well with the fried treat. I personally liked all of them combined together. And the fun of squeezing it in the donut or swirling it on top made me happy I have a kid-like personality with an adult job so I can have these type of meals.  - Cellos: as in limoncello, these chilled alcohol delights were exquisite. We tried the meyer lemon (packed with condensed flavor), blood orange vanilla (killer combo), and mocha for dessert (sinfully rich and enjoyable)  - Cocktail area: nice loungey spot in the W goes a bit earthy hotel lobby. Like the big pink himalayan salt block as an item on the table tying in the steakhouse persona, as that's what's used to dry age their meat.  - Yorkshire pudding: playful presentation with the big puff bursting out of a measuring cup. I tried not to eat it up but there was one per person and mine somehow disappeared in minutes.  - Kobe beef carpaccio: hub's favorite of the night with extra thin pieces of raw premium beef resting on that salty pink salt block. He still talks about this.  - Fried green beans: these were somehow amazing. Batter and frying job was perfect and the teriyaki sauce added just the right a bit more of salt and sweetness.  - Wine: don't remember the specifics of what we ended up ordering, but they had a nice list and the waiter made a solid recommendation based on our tastes. Also didn't just point out the spendiest bottles which I appreciated.  Midlghts:  - Razorneck clams: A for effort as I've only had these in Hong Kong. They were fine, and not too chewy, however not stellar.  - Onion rings: was looking for a bit more blow me awayness here. Batter was light and puffy but somehow after we all had one unlike the beans, we weren't encouraged to go back for more. Maybe it's cause I'm not a mustard fan and didn't dip in the sauce, but bacon mustard didn't score points with the mustard eater at the table.  Lowlights:  - King dessert: banana cake with peanut butter ice cream, chocolate cream, tempura banana, and bacon peanut brittle sounded oh so promising we couldn't wait to try. But upon having a few bites, it was pretty bland which was disappointing and surprising as all the ingredients should indicate otherwise.  LOVED this spot.

Next was the food, I will say that Burke's has the Caesar salad going on.  They do it table side the way it's supposed to be done and I can honestly say that it's the best Caesar I ever had.  I got the ""crab cake"" croutons which were also delicious.  After the salad it was all down hill.  My server said the 40-day ribeye was the best steak in Chicago.  I don't normally order the ribeye, I order the filet, but when somebody tells you that you have to take them up on it.  So I did....and I wish I didn't.  I just don't get it David Burke!!!  The steak was salty so I guess that is what people are talking about when they rave on it but I honestly have made better steaks myself with Lawry's seasoned salt.  The Ribeye was super fatty and just not anywhere close to my top 10 of steaks in Chicago.  My boyfriend got the bone-in filet which was better than the ribeye but still very disappointing.  I was wanting that moment where you put a piece of steak in your mouth and you close your eyes and cannot believe how delicious the food you are eating is.  Didn't happen, really thought it was going to be a slam dunk based on other reviews but it was what it was: BAD.",0.9947,0.758,0.182,0.059,0.5473754789272031

They brought a souffle bread with cheddar baked on top. Very good, incredibly light and flaky very much like a pastry. We started our adventure with the Devilled Eggs. Now I don't ever eat eggs, but when I saw these Faberge beauties I had to have two. Then I had the Mini Kobe Beef Corn Dogs in a light tempura batter. Wow! This is not carnival food. The homemade spicy mustard and ketchup tasted great but was not necessary. The Oysters on the half shell looked as though they were just caught. And they tasted just as delicious. Then came the house cured Prosciutto and Grilled Shrimp Arugula Salad. The shrimp were quite large and had a very delicate smokey taste. The vinegrette did not overpower this ample dish and it could have been a meal for a smaller man. At this point I figured out that we probably ordered to much food, but it was all so good I had to keep going. When my 40 Day Dry Aged Prime Steak Burker came I forgot all about not being hungry anymore. The garlic spinich and crispy shallots with bacon and mayo was a dream come tru. The fries were nice and golden with just enough salt to make your mouth scream. They closed the show with a Chocolate Mousse Cake that had a toasted marshmallow bed on top and a scoop of s'mores ice on the side. I've been saying this since I left the restaurant. Wow! If my mother cooked this good I'd still be living at home! The wine pairing was an excellent choice. Tempranillo 2007 had a crisp and smooth taste that did not interfere. It was a nice complement to the food. Our server was in touch with our needs and took very good care of us. What more can you ask for?

One of my wine groups had a friend coming into town from SoCal, so we figured what better than to drink a bunch o cabs and eat at Primehouse. The interior is definitely modern with a sleekness to it, but it doesn't feel at all like a museum or a place that is trying too hard to be trendy.  Our server jeremy was great the entire time, and right away he offered us a chance to go down and check out where all of the meat is aged. That was definitely one of those, omg moments and I was really giddy just to check it all out. The executive chef (or the executive sous chef, can't remember) gave us a tour of the basement and explained how the meat was aged and how they cut it, etc. The smells alone from the aging room were heavenly and I just soaked in the moment Getting back to the most important, the food. Since we had a group, we just ordered several appetizers and split them between us to get a good feel for the aps. All of the appetizers were delicious with the scallops being awesome and the swiss chard being great as well.  When it came time to order my steak, I could only go with one of the well aged cuts. I mean hey, when in rome right. I got the 40 day bone-in and got it medium rare. This was just pure meat enjoyment, and I made sure to savor every moment of it. Perfectly cooked with a nice bit of crispness to the outside and it just seemed to melt when eating.  We did follow that up with a order of Foie Gras afterward just so that we made sure that we'd glue as many arteries as possible in one go.

The ""Brunch in a Box"" specials at Primehouse are a great way to get a weekend day downtown started. Each ""box"" is a bento box filled with an array of small items all surrounding a main theme. This morning my wife went with the Eggs while I had the Shells. The Eggs box was perfect for someone looking for a typical egg brunch, but can't make up their mind.  The lobster omelet, eggs benedict, and kobe sausage and eggs in brioche were all spot on and live up to the usual Primehouse perfection. The Shells was just as outstanding, with 2 raw oysters, a crab pastry, angry shrimp and 2 scallops.   To accompany the boxes Primehouse offered small and large carafes of classic breakfast drinks. Today we went with a small carafe of the Classic Bloody Mary. Smooth throughout and consistently spiced, without going over the top (try the Wasabi if you want hot hot hot) they provided a wonderful accompaniment to the meal.  A small carafe served about 1.5 glasses each and was more than enough for us before noon.   We stuck around to finish our drink and get some espresso and tea, and my wife couldn't pass up the ""fill-your-own"" doughnut dessert.  Totally unnecessary, but still darn good.  The doughnuts (or really doughnut holes) were light and fluffy on the inside with a crispy sweet shell on the outside.  They would have been fine on their own, but the fillings, especially the vanilla, puts them in my top 5 for doughnuts in the city.  ""Doughnuts at a steakhouse?"" you say.  Who would have thought it... definitely not I.

The lunch entree was excellent--the 40 Day Dry Aged Prime Steak Burker.  The burger was absolutely fantastic--probably one of the best restaurant style burgers I've had.  The Truffle Asiago French Fries were also very good and definitely complimented the burger.

The restaurant decor was nice, but nothing particularly special.  The staff was friendly and attentive, but there really weren't many guests in the restaurant at the time.  In the end, I'm giving Primehouse 4 stars based primarily on the tastiness of the burger (which I thought was also very reasonably priced with the fries for $12).  Looking forward to trying that 55 or 75 day aged ribeye some time.",0.994,0.783,0.187,0.03,0.5407142857142857

It provides a unique taste, but they get a little too much hype for not actually being that amazing.",0.9633,0.836,0.146,0.018,0.6217543859649122
2010-03-13,3.0,"I visited the Primehouse during restaurant week.  Service, the amount of food, and so many things about this place are top notch.  Quite honestly, they should be for the price you pay.  The problem is that everything I ate was average.  When you expect the best, pay for the best, and receive something less, you don't get the urge to head back anytime soon. My surf and turf dumplings were off.  The texture, the flavor, everything about them was wrong.  My brother and I quickly realized that we should have gone with one of the other appetizers.  The 40-day dry aged steak burger was their take on a gourmet burger.  Rated as one of the best the city has to offer by the waitress, I left wishing I had been served a hunk of ground chuck covered in cheddar cheese.  There was nothing wrong with this burger.  I just don't see what all the fuss is about.  Perhaps gourmet and burgers don't go hand in hand for me.  The chocolate mousse cake wasn't anything to swoon over either. Maybe I went on an off night.  Maybe my taste buds can't detect high quality.  Or maybe I don't believe that adding truffles to something makes it the best thing ever.  When it was all over, I ended up leaving a steakhouse without even trying the steak.  Unfortunately, after what I ate I won't be heading back to try a steak anytime soon.  One out of two for restaurant week isn't so bad.",0.8938,0.82,0.103,0.077,0.4499206349206349

I stayed at The James and it was amazing...looking at the pictures posted on TravelAdvisor I was not impressed. The pictures do not do the place justice.  Anyways, I went down to Primehouse for breakfast. I planned to grab something and get going because I had a 10 am cooking class at The Chopping Block...I ended up spending almost an hour down in the restaurant! What amazing service and great ambiance, it completely sucked me in. As soon as I sat down I was brought my own coffee pot. Coffee tasted like Intelligentsia, a favorite. Ordered a grapefruit juice, so refreshing!  What is so impressive about this place (hotel & restaurant) is how detail oriented they are. I asked the server if the salt in the grinder was Himalayan pink salt. I didn't expect that he would know the answer. But he said ""Yes, yes!"" with a look of pride that someone took note to the subtle touches to the restaurant.  Let's also talk about their homemade jams. I must've looked like such a glutton. 1 person with a whole table filled with plates. The server brought out a plate of 3 jams and butter for my English muffin. I tried all of them! Blueberry, orange marmalade, peach ginger. When I looked at the peach ginger I thought it was honey. One taste and I fell in love: such a subtle, smooth, sweet flavor.  I also got egg whites (a tad bit too buttery for my taste) and home fries. Yum! They have a plethora of b-fast meat options: turkey bacon, bacon, ham, sausage, chicken apple sausage. I wasn't feeling meat so early in the morn, but I regret not getting it for later.

We were seated right away, in a nice booth, with frosted glass dividers to insulate us from the rest of the diners. We had decided earlier that we'd do drinks, before hand, then glasses of wine for dinner. She had the Tickled Gibson, which was nice, and I had the Key Largo Gimlet (I do love Gimlets, and this one was a very good take on the gimlet).  A popover was brought quickly to our table, and was devoured quickly. It arrived warm, and the butter melted up touch.  My Meal: I started out with the ""Surf & Turf Dumplings"" made from short ribs in 2, and lobster in the other 2. They were nicely presented on the plates. I had the burger, which is just out of this world, the waiter told me that it was one of the best in the city; he wasn't kidding. For desert, I had the White Chocolate cheesecake, which was good, but not great.  Her Meal: She had the Lobster Bisque to start, which was very good. The Delmonico steak, which was cooked to medium rare perfection, and ended with the ""slice of Prime"" which was chocolate cake w/ chocolate mousse and s'more ice cream.  The meal came with vegetables, perfectly cooked, perfectly crispy asparagus, gross mushrooms (only cause I don't like shrooms, she said they were amazing actually), and buttery whipped potatoes.  The waiter was great, he was very personable, and out going. And when we told him that we wanted to add an order of the truffle fries to share, he pointed out that my burger game with the fries, and there'd be more than enough for sharing, instead of just taking the money.

I stayed at The James Hotel last weekend and figured I'd try out David Burke's since it was in the hotel and it was Chicago Restaurant Week.  We went for lunch, the place was smaller than I'd expected, but not crowded and we were seated quickly.  Our server (Ron) was super nice and really took the time to explain the menu.  He also was nice enough to give us some great recommendations for what to do in the area and nightlife.  I love good service--I can cook my own food, I'm paying for service when I go out--so it was much appreciated. Of what we ordered, these were the GOOD: - Kobe beef sashimi on a Himalayan salt block w/ mushroom chips and truffle mayo.  (Flavor combinations were great, but also really fun plating with the giant pink brick of rock salt. See photos.) - Family-style sides: Asparagus & shallots, creamed spinach, pan roasted mushrooms, basil whipped potatoes. (I ordered a steak, which came with the sides served family style. Yum, well-cooked. Creamed spinach was heavy, but that's what it's supposed to be.) - Pan roasted Alaskan king salmon w/ anchovy butter, asparagus and shallots. - THE DESSERTS: Slice of Prime (chocolate mousse and cake) w/ fudge s'mores ice cream AND White chocolate cheesecake w/ lemon cream and raspberry sherbet. (I'm not a huge fan of sweets, but these were great and creative flavors. The sherbet and the ice cream were fantastic.) And the JUST OK: - Petite filet, 6oz (It was fine, but not amazing.  I've had much better, so I guess since this is a Primehouse, it's a little disappointing.  I ordered it cooked medium, but it was a little too well-done.  I guess it's relative.  Also, it's a small cut.)

2010-03-02,5.0,"5 stars for steak, and for the sides. 3 stars for everything else, but you go to a steak house for steak...right??? My friend has raved about this place, so we were glad to have an opportunity to dine with them during Restaurant Week. The restaurant was well worth the praise. After dining at Primehouse I will no longer be ordering wet-aged steaks... If you've never had dry-aged steak, then here's your chance. There are very few establishments in Chicago that dry-age their steak due to the prohibitive cost. However, if you enjoy tasty/fatty/beefy steak, then dry-aged is your only option. Appetizers and Deserts I had the Kobe sashimi based on other user's recommendations. This was the worst dish of the night. Very small order, too salty, no subtlety. It felt like I was eating very raw/soft beef jerky. Nothing memorable about this dish. The only positive was that the mayo/horse radish infused with truffle oil was very tasty. It was a great spread for the bread and tostinis. Steak! I ordered the  55-day rib eye (dry-aged) No sauce/no accompaniments. Medium-rare temperature. The steak was delicious. The flavor was very beefy and very intense. There was a fair amount of fat and marbling, but I wish there was more. Basically, this was one of the best steaks I have ever had, and it was not due to the tenderness nor marbling, but specifically due to the taste. Think of red wine versus aged red wine. Aging brings out smells and tastes that were previously hidden. The same occurs with the steak when dry-aged. Without any additional sauces, salt, or accompaniments the steak itself was delicious and very well flavored. The best part of this meal was when I tried my friend's steak (dry-aged 5 days). His steak was bland, dry, boring, and basically incomparable to what I was eating. The additional dry-aging days in the salt cellar really made a huge difference. Pros: taste Cons: temperature was slightly warmer than I would have preferred (more medium than medium rare) Could have had more marbling and been slightly fattier The sides were very good. The mushrooms were bursting with flavor (olive oil and herbs), the whipped potatoes were a little dry, the asparagus were fresh, and the creamed spinach was very tasty, although a bit TOO creamy (you could literally taste the butter). If you enjoy steak, then you must try dry-aging. Primehouse is one of the few establishments with dry-aging, so go.",0.998,0.761,0.204,0.036,0.539805194805195

I already tried the #10 burger at Cortlands garage which was excellent. The ""burker"" at DB's was amazing as well. Nothing to complex about it, just the quality of the meat comes from a $70 steak! And you can taste it. It just melts in your mouth. I was worried about the potato bun, but it was a good complement to the juicy steak burger. The fries were amazing as well. If you put truffle oil and asiago cheese on anything, it's bound to be good right :) The first and last courses were good as well. Kobe beef Sashimi was good - I just wish there was more. Very tender. And the cheese cake was good, but not mind blowing.  Recommendation - skip for restaurant week lunches. Their restaurant week dinner menu looks like a good deal though.

2010-02-26,4.0,"Went here for restaurant week and it was great. I'm going to make a few comparisons with Ruth's Chris since I had them 2 days apart for the lunch restaurant week. What a great opportunity to compare grain fed wet aged steak vs. grass fed dry aged steak.  Decor-more modern and a younger crowd than Ruth's. Nice warm red, brown, and orangey yellow throughout the dining area.  Service- We were seated promptly and the server was very friendly. It seemed they were only handing out the restaurant week menu. ""A"" drinks at the speed of lightening but they refilled his water before it hit the bottom the entire time. Impressive since it must have been 4-5x while mine was only 2x.. The server was quick, checked up on us, and would let us know that our next course was on its way. He basically was very good at letting us know he was paying attention to us and wanted to make sure we were having a good time without being too intrusive. Food: We ordered the beef sashimi, I got the new york sirloin,  ""A"" got the delmonico, and we both got the cheesecake for dessert. Popover- The provided each of us with a cheese popover thing in a its own little pan. Very cute and tasty.  Beef Sashimi- I thought I would love it because I really like the beef carpaccio at Flemmings (happy hour rox). I don't know what happened here for me...the meat wasn't silky and it got way too salty (I eat slow), ""A"" loved his and tasted mine and said his was better. But, then again he eats at the speed of sound. His was served on white colored salt block while mine was pink. I doubt that made a difference...maybe it is all in making sure you don't leave it on the block too long...perhaps remove it promptly and brush it against the block if you want additional salt. He really liked the little shavings on top, I was more indifferent. The aioli with truffle on the side was delicious and I put some on my cheese popover..tasty. New York Sirloin - Cooked perfectly, the outside was crisp with all those yummy crunchy carmelized meaty crusty bits and not at all burnt. I thought it was a delicious steak and not too fatty. Delmonico- Basically its a ribeye. It was much fattier but ""A"" preferred this one over the New York. I had to remove a lot of fat from the parts I got which made me sad.  Sides: They gave us a set of four to share. Grilled asparagus, mushrooms, creamed spinach, and basil whipped mashed potatoes. I really liked that they presented such a variety. The mashed potatoes were a bit salty but when paired with the steak and other stuff it was good. A few of the asparagus spears were a bit stringy but overall it was good. Mushrooms were not the typical button or baby bellas and were very nice. ""A"" liked the creamed spinach (not something he normally likes) because it wasn't too creamy. Weird thing is that I think that some tables got larger portions of these sides even with the same number of people. I am unsure how they decide on which portion size to give (each side is in a little pan but the pan sizes were vastly different on different tables). Perhaps people who ordered wine got larger sides? Unsure. One thing I liked about the sides were that they weren't laden with butter like Ruth's. I think if Ruth's just buttered some items instead of all, it would be better, we basically fell into a sleepy mess after that meal.  Dessert: It was a little raspberry cheesecake and a scoop of key lime ice cream I believe..I was just ok with it. I'm not big on dessert. I liked the portion size though, just enough and not too much. I gave half of mine to ""A"" who seemed to enjoy the whole thing a lot more than me.  Overall- great steaks cooked perfectly medium rare. I don't know why so many people got it overdone, but ours were just right.  Oh one thing I didn't like was that it was very loud in there, I couldn't always hear ""A"" across the table. But, still a very nice place to go esp during restaurant week for lunch. ""A"" says he could taste the difference...and I don't know if it was the lack of butter on everything but I felt that the meal made me feel a lot better afterwards than Ruth's did. ""A"" said he wouldn't mind hitting it up again even not during restaurant week.",0.9991,0.78,0.182,0.038,0.5569615408745843

Was I blown away by the food here? No. However, it was worth it to know I am getting similar quality food at other places around town for a much lower price.   Started off with the kobe beef sashimi, which was served on rock salt and fittingly salty. They give you 4 super tiny pieces, but it tasted great and I'm not sure where else I would order it. My companions got the dumplings and liked the short rib bbq variety.  For the entree I stuck with the regular menu instead of upgrading to thier full sized cuts. I got a 7 oz delmonico steak and it was coooked to perfection. Yes it was small, but savory enough that I was happy. The sides were good, but nothing to write home about. Favorite was the pan roasted mushrooms.  Dessert was a difficult choice between the cheescake and ""The King."" I went with ""The King,"" which is peanut butter ice cream on top of a bannana cake with peanut bacon brittle on top of it all.

2010-02-25,3.0,"Went last night to take advantage of the Restaurant Week menu. Seems like they figured that everyone would order off that menu, since the regular menu never appeared! I went for the Kobe Beef Sashimi, 7 oz Delmonico steak (added foie gras to that for $15!), and the King dessert. The hubby went with the Surf and Turf dumplings, 7 oz Strip and the Prime dessert. Sashimi was thin slices of beef served on a salt block. Pet peeve, this isn't Kobe beef. It is Wagyu which is similar to Kobe, but I would not believe that the beef came from Japan. Anyways, it was OK. The dumplings were not as good as I expected. The wrapper was dried out on the top and the fillings were mushy. The steaks came and they were tiny. The delmonico looked bigger because it was thicker (maybe an inch and a half?). The strip was probably arouund 1/2 inch thick. My pet peeve? The $15 foie gras that I added was 2 pieces around the size of a quarter. And it was overcooked. I understand that some restaurants cook the foie a little longer because some people may not appreciate the way foie is supposed to be cooked. But maybe they should have asked? Sides were so-so. Creamed spinach and mushrooms were good. Asparagus was bland and the mashed potatoes had a layer of truffle oil floating on top. Dessert was good. The King was a banana cake with peanut butter ice cream and a peanut bacon brittle. The brittle was good. The Prime cake was chocolate mousse in a chocolate cake. Pretty good, not too sweet. The Restaurant Week menu was $32. I think the prix fixe at Flemings is a much better deal. Bigger, more flavorful steak, better sides...",-0.4169,0.837,0.075,0.087,0.5199457593688362
2010-02-25,4.0,"Went here for a Valentine's Day meal and loved it! Of course, since it was Vday weekend, they make you do a prix fixed meal where they jack up the price. However, I know that this place is pricey anyhow, so actually think we got a pretty good deal.  For $75 a person, we got a whole plate of h'or doevres (2 of each kind), a choice of a first course, a choice of an entree, 2 sides each, and a choice of dessert. (That is a lot of food!) The h'or doevres included raw oysters; foie gras, tuna tartar, and caviar on crackers; shrimp and... there might be one I forgot. Anyway, there was a lot of food! And they brought bread, too. So let's just say after that, I was already kind of full.  Then we got the 1st course... between the two of us we had the wedge salad and the scallops. They were both good, but nothing amazing. It did take awhile, but then we got our entrees, which we both ordered the bone-in filet. AMAZING! First of all, it was huge! We ordered medium rare and it was cooked to perfection, tender and juicy! I also got truffle mousse on mine.... fabulous! The steaks were so big, we took home almost one whole one combined! (And, they were delicious two days later, too.) By the time dessert rolled around we were stuffed. I can't even remember what we had but it was just average at best. For drinks we complemented the steak with a nice bottle of Malbec and I also tried a cocktail of theirs. Overall, great dinner.

2010-02-25,4.0,"Wow! Is all I can say after my dinner at David Burkes last night. Probably the best value and tastiest restaurant week menu I've had in the past three years. 4 friends and I had 7:30 reservations for the restaurant but got to the restaurant a little early for have some drinks at the bar around 6:45. We weren't seated until 8 pm, but after two glasses of wine each, it didn't really matter to us. Moments after we were seated our waiter came by to introduce himself, walked us through the menu, took our drinks orders and his assistant came out with the popovers and butter. These popovers are not your grandma's popovers. They were very flavorful and delicious. My only complaint was that they were a little lukewarm. After we were done with our popovers our waiter came by to take our order. Two of my friends ordered the lobster bisque, two had the surf and turf  dumplings, and I had the Kobe beef sashimi. I wasn't a huge fan of the surf and turf, but my sashimi appetizer was one of the BEST things I had eaten all year (and by year I mean since February 2009 NOT January 2010). The toasted slices of bread layered with a generous spread of the truffle mayo and the slice of beef carpaccio was just the perfect blend of earthy/meaty flavors. I thought the lobster bisque was also one of the best I had ever had. It was much darker than other lobster bisques I've had and much more of a meaty flavor. For the entree, two ordered the delmonico steak (one added on a $15 slice of foie gras), two ordered the NY strip, and I had the petit filet. This is where the minus one star really comes in. I ordered my filet medium and it definitely came out well. My friend ordered her NY strip medium rare, and hers came out medium well. The great thing about it however was that our waiter stayed at our table to watch us each cut through the middle to make sure all our steaks checked out okay. Once he saw mine he didn't even flinch and said, oh no, that's not right. In no more than 5 minutes he came back with the perfectly cooked medium filet. But still, it's a steakhouse - there shouldn't have to be second tries.... Moving on, I thought the sides were really good. The cream of spinach and wild mushrooms were my favorites. The asparagus and mashed potatoes were perfect also. We were all so stuffed but kept sneaking spoonfuls of the sides into our mouths when each other weren't looking! Now dessert was just okay. I thought the ""King"" was pretty good. The cheesecake was okay - but the sorbet that came with it was an odd combo. The mousse cake looked delicious and our friend didn't share a bite of that with anyone so I'll never know... All in all though, not a single person was disappointed with their meal. We each paid about $51 for our meal, wine, tax and tip. Well worth every penny! I should caution - the floors are very slippery. Ladies in heels - be careful! If you don't take baby steps, you might find your face landing in a bowl of creamed spinach.",0.9983,0.773,0.182,0.045,0.5049603174603176

I cut them some slack given its restaurant week, but I was expenting a little more.  I also felt a bit rushed as the main courses came before the appeztizers were done and it seemed like they wanted to get people in and out (again, I understand its restaurant week).

2010-02-24,3.0,"How did I not write this review earlier?!   We were there with a group for Restaurant Week, 2009.  I was pretty freakin' pumped about heading over there... I had heard some good things about the Primehouse and was anticipating fantastic food and excellent service.   I was partially correct.   So, we had reservations and although we were there on time, our table wasn't ready.  We sat around waiting for about 30 minutes.  If it hadn't been Restaurant Week, I would have wondered what in the Hell was going on.  But, since I know it can be chaotic, I relaxed.   The dining room is very pretty and modern.  However, I don't know what it was about the accoustics but I couldn't hear anyone at our for table of 8 aside from my husband.   Our waiter was super attentive... but forgot to tell us that they were out of some things until we tried to order them.  Oooops.  Nothing drives me more insane than that.   I forget what the rest of our party did but my husband and I upgraded from the Restaurant Week menu.  He went balls out and got the longest aged steak he could get his hands on... I went midgrade.  The steaks were DELICIOUS.  Very good.   But this is where it gets really bad... After the food came out... we didn't see our server.  He was seriously MIA.  Then some other server came over and asked us what we wanted for dessert.  We told him and my husband requested coffee with it.  We waited... and waited... and waited.  The dessert came, but no coffee.  So, we tried to flag down a server... ANY server at that point... but neither our first or our second ones were to be seen.  We waited and looked for them for about 15 minutes.  My dude has this thing where he can't eat dessert without coffee (I know... totally bizzare) and so he skipped it because we literally couldn't get someone to get us coffee.   Then... 20 minutes later... our first server shows up without a ""sorry"" or ""do you need anything?"".  Just the check.  Fine.   So he comes back and while some of us had cash, two were paying with credit card.  I know that can be confusing so we even wrote a note to go inside the bill ""Mastercard - $this much, Visa - $this much"".   What do you know?  They reversed it.  Of course they did.   So then we waited for someone to come and fix it for us.  And we waited.  And we waited.  And we waited.  After about 15 minutes of just waiting for someone to come take the bill so we could explain the mixup, my dude lost his temper a little bit and jumped up and asked the first busboy and asked to speak to the manager.  We explained how we had never gotten the coffee... how we had to wait forever for the check... how even though we wrote a note in the bill it got screwed up and THEN no one came to check on it after 15 minutes so we had to flag him down.   He seemed pretty much unimpressed.  We figured as much since our tab was already paid up.   I filled out a comment card about our experience and left it in with the bill.  To the restaurants credit, we got a call the next day in addition to an email saying that they were so sorry to hear of our experience.  I was then mailed a $50 gift certificate... which was very nice of them... however, since meals there are significantly more than that, I'd just assume save my money and go somewhere I know I'll get awesome service in addition to good food.   I'd try it again... but I'm not in a hurry.",0.9857,0.84,0.1,0.06,0.5462839506172839

We started with the surf and turf dumplings and the lobster bisque.  Clearly this place knows their way around a lobster as well as the lobster dumplings were delish and the bisque was fantastic.  I thought the apples actually did add to the soup in texture and flavor.  I also got some giant pieces of lobster which was a great surprise. I opted for the 6 oz filet and my boyfriend got the delmonico.  Both were cooked perfectly to our specification.  They also came with 4 small sides of basil mashed potatoes, sauteed mushrooms, creamed spinach and some really oniony asparagus.  And I'm going to stress small since we each got about a small spoonful of each. For dessert with shared the Slice of Prime which is a layered cake with chocolate mousse and smores ice cream and the King which is a banana cake with ice cream and bananas and other delicious items.  Both were phenominal.

Of course, our money saved on the food was going to be spent appropriately accessorizing our meals with drinks.  A Tickled Gibson for me (those pickled onions were insanely good) and a Key Largo Giblet for him started our dining experience off right (as it should've at $14 a pop...geez). The popovers were awesome, but the butter served aside them was even better.  I saw the popover as more of a conduit for the butter, since it's not socially acceptable to just eat butter by itself.  Well, in public, at least. Lobster bisque was flavorful, creamy and hot, all the things a bisque should be.  Oh, and the darling little lobster spring roll served on the side?  Positively dunkable. I went with the Delmonico steak (center cut of the ribeye) which at seven ounces is the perfect size for me.  It was cooked to perfection, all in its medium rare glory.  And the sides served were incredible.  I was SO GLAD to be dating an anti-mushrooms man cuz I polished the entire little dish off myself.  The asparagus and basil-whipped potatoes were no slouch either. My date had the burger, and my bite explained why he was quiet for ten minutes as he ate it and then went outside and smoked a cigarette.*  Phenomenal, truly, and cooked perfectly as well. For dessert?  Slice of prime for me and raspberry cheesecake for him.  We polished those off too, no problem. Service was pleasant, helpful and efficient, especially given the volume of diners on a Sunday evening.

It was restaurant week but after seeing the size of the steaks that were being served from that menu my entire party decided to upgrade to full sized steaks.

As for the steak, the ladies in our party both had the filet mignon which was super tender, almost too tender for me but that's why I didn't order it.

The best steak I've had in a long while, and I've been eating a lot of steak lately.  Dessert was great too, had the slice of prime and sampled the peanut butter dessert and also the cheesecake.

I started with the lobster bisque which was good, but I've had better.  They use apples in it, which I didn't think added anything to the dish.   For the entree I was torn between the fillet and the 40 day dry aged steak burger.  The burger won out and was quite tasty.  It was probably the best burger I've had in quite a while.  I only had a couple fries but I was told by my companions that they were excellent. Dessert was a bit of a let down.  I had the white chocolate cheesecake with raspberry sorbet.  While it was good, there was nothing really special about it.  It was a typical tasty dessert.  I was really impressed by the plate/bowl it was served in though.  I kinda want a set of those now.

2010-02-23,4.0,"First of all, big props to DB's for really embracing Restaurant Week and doing it right! I've been to other RW restaurants in the past where you had to ask for their RW menu, and they sometimes came with some serious 'tude. DB's gave us the RW menu when we sat down, and you had to ask for their REGULAR menu if you wanted it. Also, this is the only place I've seen that gave you upgrade options on the RW menu, allowing you to try some of their pricier steaks for an upcharge that was still below regular price. The service was very good. Our waiter was professional without being snooty, water glasses were refilled on a regular basis. The server recommended a wine which was actually the cheaper of the two that we asked about, much to our surprise. And it was good! My only complaint in this area is that I asked for my steak ""au poivre"" but it just came out plain. However, I was distracted and didn't notice right away so I didn't say anything. The upcharge wasn't on the bill, so I let it go. I probably would have been happier with the first course if I liked seafood or raw beef. The only options that fit my criteria were the two salads; the wedge was OK, but nothing special. I think the Kobe beef sashimi (served on a brick of the salt they use for aging) and the lobster bisque were where it was at (according to my dining companions anyway...Kate didn't ""yadda yadda yadda"" over the bisque). The entrees were very well-received all around. Among the four of us we tried all of the beef entrees: delmonico steak, petite filet, hamburger and NY sirloin.  I had the sirloin, and it was good and perfectly cooked. The filet was ordered medium but it looked pretty medium rare to me. Everyone enjoyed their entrees, and the family-style sides that came with the steaks were good too. Perhaps the best thing on the table at the time were the fries that came with the burger. I couldn't stop stealing them! Dessert was, I'm sad to say, a bit underwhelming. The King sounds better on paper than it is in reality, but that little piece of peanut bacon brittle on top caused some stirring in my pants, it was so good! I also tried a bite of the Slice of Prime, which I liked better than The King. The strengths here seem to be service (for the most part), the environment (very nice) and the beef...appropriately for a steakhouse. I'd like to come back here some time and splurge on one of their bigger, badder steaks...with a side of those delectable fries!

I chalk it up to being busy as there were several groups that seemed to arrive one after the other.  Hooray for Restaurant week! We opened with the Kobe beef sashimi--I didn't like it,  I loved it!  Loved the presentation on the salt brick and the truffle mayo added some richness.  I got a taste of Hub's Lobster Bisque--that was wonderful too, rich and creamy.  Main course was the New York cut.  It was very good, and came out Medium like we ordered. It was not the best steak I've ever had but still good steak.  It came with sides of asparagus, creamed spinach, mushrooms and mashed potatoes.  Love that the asparagus was crisp tender because some places can really mess that up.  Loved the creamed spinach too.  The mushrooms and potatoes were just ok--nothing special.  We ordered a side of Truffle Asiago Fries--this was probably my favorite side of the night!  It was fight-over-the-last-fry-in-the-basket-good!  Dessert was Slice of Prime chocolate cake and the White Chocolate Cheesecake.  The White Chocolate Cheesecake was the clear winner--the raspberry sorbet served with it, really gave it a fresh finish.  The service was wonderful, professional, very friendly without hovering.  We loved our beginning cocktails and wine with dinner.  It can be a bit loud so don't expect an intimate dinner. I'm curious about the longer-aged steaks and would like to try that.  With mostly positives to note, I'd definitely be back.",0.9943,0.747,0.196,0.057,0.4945976245976246
2010-02-21,4.0,"Let me just start off by saying, if you find yourself in this steakhouse you need to have the 75 day aged rib eye. It was amazing and all other steaks I have will be compared to this one.  2 buddy's and I had dinner here on the 12th of February. We have all worked in fine dinning and steakhouses so we can be a tough crowd to please.  Under our pressure David Burke's shinned. The server was prompt, knowledgeable, funny, and very helpful. She gave us the story of the restaurant and Prime (the prize winning bull) without sounding canned and robotic. She did really need to sell us on anything as we are somewhat foodies.  For apps we had the Kobe beef (not from Kobe, but US so its not really Kobe but of well), sweat breads, and the foie gras. They were all great and good sized for a steakhouse of this price.  No salads or soups for us.  So we got a 55 and 75 day aged for the table along with 3 sides (spinach, asparagus, potatoes) all to share.  We originally ordered our steaks rare, but at a real steakhouse that means cold in the middle. Our server suggested otherwise, suggesting that the chef suggest medium rare because you need to the inside of the the steak to get warm enough to render the fat. This is the best argument I have heard against rare steaks and it makes perfect sense. Rare may make you seem like a bad ass but its true the inside of the steak needs to be cooked somewhat to melt (render) the fat.  Now about the flavor, words can not describe the delicious aged, smokey, oaky flavor that came out the steak. They were literally fork tender and very most and delicious. The 55 was a little firmer and not as smokey but still very good.  Here was the toper, we even got a tour to the ageing room, We were like kids in a candy store inside the room freaking out. (if you have every seen that scene in Halfbaked when they break into the weed safe and still all the weed, it was pretty much like that.)  All in all we had a great time and I will be back at my next trip to Chicago.  To all the complainers that ""this app sucked"" or ""my steak was overdone"" send that stuff back and complain to the manager. The restaurant biz is tough and these top dollar places want you to be happy so you will tell your friends and come back. As I use to tell my servers that bitched at me when I was a bus boy ""the squeaky wheel gets the grease). So speak up or shut up its your own fault.",0.9934,0.759,0.164,0.076,0.5845289855072463

This place is hands down the best steakhouse in Chicago.  Once you go dry-aged you never go back! American Waygu Carpaccio was enhanced by the mayo, but I would have liked olive oil. The steaks here are the top! The game is over before it begins because they have the best preparation process. Took a tour of the aging room (yes call it touristy but we met Chef Gresh). Seriously people there is a reason the front of the house asks if your steak is cooked to your liking, its because YOU CAN SEND IT BACK in a place this nice! It is acceptable to send back your steak if it is not properly cooked; once - the second time you really should just live with it.  This process is the same as ordering a bottle of wine, refuse to be polite get what you want and do not compromise only to later give a low review because you do not have the brass ones to send back a steak.  And if you are the type of diner that gives off signals like you want to shrink away or express your distain for this action, either you do not often pay the bill or are impolite. So I want to encourage all to send back under/overcooked meat!

2010-02-17,4.0,"The bf and I started off our meal with three appetizers because we exercise really good self-control. Two of them were terrible -- the surf and turf dumplings were extremely mushy and didn't taste like anything and the lobster bisque was bland. These two appetizers are the only reason I'm giving David Burke's 4 instead of 5 stars...they were worse than appetizers you'd find at Chili's or any other casual dining place. The Kobe Beef Sashimi appetizer was perfect though-- it's a definite must-have as I'm sure every other review here has made clear. The steaks were, as expected, both done well. I liked the Delmonico steak better than the NY Sirloin because I thought the NY sirloin tasted a little too strong.  I loved two of the desserts we got (once again, we got three...it's that self control thing again). The Slice of Prime is a rich chocolate mousse that melts in your mouth without being oversweet like so many chocolate mousses are. The star was definitely (and surprisingly) the root beer float. Obviously I wasn't expecting much from a root beer float but they somehow made it the classic root beer float into something special. Instead of the separate vanilla ice cream and root beer deal, they made the root beer into something I can only describe as creamier than a granita but less creamy than ice cream or gelato. I know that description was extraordinarily unhelpful but I would definitely try it if you go -- it's definitely not your run of the mill vanilla ice cream dumped in root beer (although those are always good too...). I think it was even better than the cheesecake lollipops which were cute but come on people, they're antenna balls of cheesecake rolled around in toppings and stuck on sticks.  The best part was definitely the service. Not only did our waiter not laugh when we ordered three appetizers, two steaks, and two desserts for two people, when I asked him for cheesecake lollipops on top of all that, he gave us a mini sampler on the house.

2010-02-15,1.0,Don't waste your money.  Over rated.  I can compare Primehouse with at least 10 other Steak Houses and our steaks on Valentine's night were tasteless and undercooked.  They shortcut the appetizers by serving premade assortment of mediocre items. Caesar salad was bland.  They comp'd one dinner for us but I had bought a $140 bottle of wine with expectations we'd have a steak to compliment it.  Bone In Ribeye was TOUGH.  Every bite was a challenge to eat.  After 6 bites I gave up.  Great Service.  Dessert was great.The crowd was average 30 year olds.  which goes to show you the seasoned steak aficionado doesn't show up here.  Got to Fleming's instead they are levels above Primehouse and half the price.,0.8769,0.874,0.104,0.023,0.5006944444444444
2010-02-15,4.0,"This is a review about meat.  My parents are meat people.  Oh they'll have side dishes and appetizers and desserts.  They'll have something with a different sort of preparation if it is presented to them.  But when they wanted to have dinner down in the Loop/near North Side area (they are of the suburban variety) they wanted meat.  Unadorned and well-aged hunks of steak. So I gave them the David Burke's menu.  They began drooling.  That made the decision making process simple. The appetizers at DB's are excellent.  The Kobe Beef Sashimi by itself is tasty and is of course meaty.  But the truffle mayo that comes with the dish, and the mushroom chips are what make it addictive.  The truffle mayo could probably be put in a soft drink cup and drank as the most decadent and heart attacky shake ever.  The crab cake is another dish that begins with a solid but not amazing core.  But the mango-mayo is just so incredibly bright and refreshing that it lifts the entire dish. But enough of this frippery.  This is a review of meat.  And the meat is certainly noteworthy.  The four of us at dinner decided to each try a different cut so that we could compare notes and try a little of each other's selections.  My thoughts on each: - ""South Side"" filet mignon, bone-in: I am unsure how long this cut is aged for.  I don't believe very long.  This cut was very good, but nothing out of the ordinary. - 35-day aged Kansas City sirloin: My wife had this steak.  In contrast to the more aged cuts that others had this steak seemed very young.  It had a freshness and a juiciness that made me wonder if there was a cow walking around in the back just missing a chunk from its body.  It is odd, because I suspect this was aged much longer than the South Side filet, but seemed less so. - 55 day aged Ribeye: This was the cut our waiter suggested as the best piece of meat they had.  This might be the most pure meat selection you can get at DB's.  It might be the most pure meat selection you can get in the city come to think of it.  It tasted like someone took 3 steaks and somehow pushed them all together, bending the very laws of time and space, and thus created a MEGA-STEAK.  This tasted like meat as meat should be. - 75 day aged ribeye: This was my cut of meat.  As I told the server, it was time to try climbing meat mountain.  You rarely get a steak that is described the way one might describe a wine, with the various hints and notes of other flavors to be alert for.  But this seemed fitting with this piece.  I've never had a steak so supple, so giving to the knife.  The fat of the steak melted in my mouth upon touching my teeth and palate.  I think the texture may have been more interesting and satisfying than the taste.  Not to sell the taste short.  The moment when I picked up a blue cheese like flavor in the meat was surprising and wonderful.   I recommend this cut to any meat devotee to try at least once.  It might not be the most satisfying steak you'll ever eat in terms of meaty goodness, but it is something unique.  I've had a LOT of steak in my lifetime, and I can honestly say this cut was something new to me. The desserts there are quite tasty.  The King, with its bacon peanut brittle and tempura fried bananas is absurd in its flavor combinations and absolutely wonderful for ending the meal.  The Salted Caramel ice cream was an unexpected treat. Service was on par with what you would expect in terms of food and wine knowledge.  The staff did acquit themselves very well with a few small instances.  When my folks were lamenting not being able to bring leftovers to their most favored children of the canine variety due to being on their way to a show after dinner, the server offered to keep their leftovers refrigerated for pickup after their show.  When they realized they had left their reading glasses in their coats, the hostess quickly retrieved the glasses for my folks, saving me from having to read the menu aloud to them for which I was very grateful. In a city with a lot of meat, and a lot of places to eat it, DB's is certainly worthy of being in the upper tier of choices.  The dry-aged cuts are worth the notice of any meat connoisseur who fancies themselves a black belt carnivore.  You're going to pay here (our tab was around $150 a person at the end of the night), but really, what steakhouse worth your time is going to be a cheap night out? And one more thing.  MEAT!",0.997,0.824,0.124,0.053,0.49239101776138805

I have seen less than efficient service at the lobby bar, but I'm not sure its fair for me to lump them in with dinner. Looks like they're typically understaffed. The restaurant has always been fine. The Goods: If you came here and aren't a moo fan, might as well go elsewhere. If you are, you're best served going dry aged. Its the best thing they do and they're some of the better ones I've had.

There were multiple televisions recessed into the bar and a endless stream of people walking behind us. No one seemed particularly happy to be there or anxious to stay long. Negativity aside, my blackberry hot toddy was fantastic. Hot, boozy drinks can often be tired or taste like Theraflu but this was delicious. There was real blackberry compote and cloves floating around in there plus a honey stick for a cocktail stirrer. Lovely. Also, the complimentary bar snack was by far the most interesting of everything we've had - chocolate bark with popcorn. Most tasty. Ho hum though. I'm finished with my drink.

I felt a 3 star rating seemed to harsh, but a 4 star was definitely to high, especially when I considered some of the other outstanding meals I have had at restaurants I rated with 4 stars. So I will chose the path of least resistance, and say this a 3.5 star restaurant. Part of the reason I was slightly disappointed was that, I had very high expectations. I have dined at David Burke & Donatella in NYC and David Burke in Las Vegas, and both were very, very good. Anyway, that's enough of an introduction, onto the experience. The restaurant was packed, but my girlfriend and I were immediately seated when we arrived, which was exactly at the time of our reservation.... although you'd expect being seated at the time of your reservation, at a busy Chicago steakhouse, this isn't always the case. We started the meal with two martini's, which were both perfectly made. Shortly after our waiter arrived with giant poofs of bread, to be honest, these looked better than they tasted. The best way I can describe them is an ""Air Filled Carb Balloon."" My personal highlight was the bottle of wine I ordered. I had checked out the menu in advance and found a bottle that had outstanding ratings, and only cost $115. I know that is not cheap, but I could not find the exact bottle anywhere online for less than $90... so I chose to focus on the value of my purchase more so than the price, I had to justify it somehow, right?  For appetizers we order the highly touted beef tartare, which was just ok and a salad, which was, well, a salad. For the entrees we ordered two dry aged steaks, the fresh sauteed spinach and the truffle fries. I think the problem with DB lies at this portion of the meal. They make the steaks seem like something you have never experienced, charge according to that perception, but the steaks don't hold up. The steaks were good, don't get me wrong, but they were just good, nothing more. The fresh spinach was absolutely amazing, and I wish I could replicate it at home.  The Truffle Fries were also very good, and the sides definitely outshine the steaks.  Overall, it is a good steakhouse, but my expectations were not quite met...

2010-01-10,1.0,"We have an unfortunate story to tell about David Burke's It began well- my wife found that they served a nice prix fixe menu on NYE- so we reserved a table for 6. Our friends like to bring a nice bottle or two to celebrate big occasions so on Dec. 28 when the restaurant called to confirm, I spoke to a manager about waiving the corkage fee. See, they charge $20 for the first bottle and $40 for each subsequent bottle. Honestly, I didn't mind paying for 1 or maybe 2 but after that seems excessive. The manager I spoke with was nice enough to waive the fees past the 1st bottle. I asked him to write this note on our reservation so that I wouldn't have to go through the timely process of explaining this at dinner.  So we arrive at dinner. We are seated 20 minutes late, which we can forgive b/c its NYE after all. We sit down and tell our waiter our ""deal"" we made with the manager re: corkage fees. He checks with the GM (not the manager I spoke with on the phone). The GM proceeds to come to our table and tells us flat out that ""No one who works here would have ever agreed to that request."" Implying that I am lying in front of my wife and our 4 friends. After a back and forth, the GM was ""trying"" to make amends and offered to buy us a round of drinks b/c ""You wouldn't get a table anywhere else on NYE now"". Implying that WE were lucky even to be at his restaurant. I then pull out my phone, show him the date and time of the call in which I spoke to another manager and asked him to ask this manager if indeed he agreed to this corkage fee deal. The GM reported back to us that the manager I spoke with on the 28th did NOT agree to such a request. At this point, everyone at our table is upset b/c we've been humiliated by the GM. I understand sometimes there is confusion but isn't the customer always right? I mean, this guy literally implied I was lying. Why would I lie- we're already spending more than $100 per person? And my story was too detailed to make up on the spot. Luckily, the GM ate his words. About 30 minutes into our meal, he very nicely came to our table with a slip of paper. He had found the reservation note that waived our corkage fees beyond the first bottle. He admitted he was embarrassed and that this probably ranked in the top ten of mistakes. He also gave us a bottle of champagne. He didn't have to admit he found the reservation note so we are thankful he came back and owned up to it. At such a nice place, an apology doesn't make up for this 100%- it made the food taste a little more bitter.

As much as I hate to admit it, I have to say that the steak was indeed phenomenol.  Probably the best steak I've ever had. Things that pissed me off - everything, and I do mean everything, has to be ordered a la carte.  This includes the sauce for your steak if you want some, sides which are quite small, and anything else you can think of.  This is the main reason why I'm giving them a 3 star rating.  If you're going to spend a small fortune on a piece of meat, it would help psychologically if it came with at least one side dish.  I am not opposed to spending money on food - in fact, we spend most of our money on dining out - so the fact that I was appalled at the price of the steak means a lot.

My server was extremely knowledgeable, but we did wait a substantial amount of time for our food. I think that was due to the fact that it was busy, but I did see others receive their food before me.

The prix fixe menu had so many good choices that at first made it tough to decide but luckily we all share easily enough that it wasn't a problem. I had the corned hash and eggs. They used corned venison and fried quail eggs and it was definitely the best appetizer of the night. The roasted chestnut soup with chorizo and apples was good too. The lump crab salad was darn tasty and they didn't skimp on the crab. As for entree, the traditional turkey dinner was quite good and did they ever load on the turkey. The mashed sweet potatoes were my favorite side dish. They also offered ham, salmon and steak dishes as well. The two best desserts on the menu were the Milk Chocolate Crème Brulee and Granny Smith Apple Cobbler. A perfect ending for a very good visit to Primehouse.

They knew we were sharing it, so when it arrived it was already cut off the bone.  The PROBLEM was that the meat left on the bone was cooked well, and I couldn't even saw it off the bone.  The ONLY reason I order steaks with the bone on is because the meat next to the bone is extra tender and flavorful.  I let the server know why that disappointed me.  I didn't want to send it back, although I should've.  It was less tender than a regular Porterhouse, and I specifically asked the host/manager if the aging would make it more tender.  Rather than make any real effort to make amends for my disappointment, they gave us a few doughnut holes to take home.,( gee thanks,) The creamed spinach was pretty good, the fries were crispy.  The prior visit I had the Lobster bisque with lobster roll, and they were great.  I also had the eggs Benidict which were very good.  Other than those 2 items, everything else was good thru disappointing, and I won't go back.",0.9456,0.791,0.126,0.083,0.40737467294610147

The first time was for our company holiday party which was a horrible experience as we were there for nearly 5 hours for a group of 30 with only 2 servers. I don't even want to start rambling off my complaints from that night. The second time went with the family while they were staying at the James-service was great as was the food. Net net-go for the food; take a gamble on service.  Shellfish Castle-This was pretty good. Oysters were plump and shrimp was fresh. The salmon tartare was fantastic. I may skip the shellfish castle and go for just straight oysters and tartare next time.  Kobe Beef Sashimi-This was good but I didn't really enjoy the presentation on the block of Himalayan salt as I had thoughts of them reusing it, and previous patrons licking the block clean...I could have done without the truffle-mayo as I found this a bit too heavy and masked the flavor of the Kobe.  Surf and Turf Dumplings-Good but nothing special.  Lobster Bisque-Again good, but nothing special.  Bread-whatever popover they served with fresh butter was so tasty and melted in your mouth. This was a nice touch and free addition to the meal.  55 Day Aged Ribeye-20oz bone-in was sooooo yummy. This and the ribeye at Osteria via Strato, surprisingly, was one of my favorites. Charred perfectly on the outside and meltingly juicy inside. This is truly a great steak to try, but at $62 a la carte, it is a bit pricey. I did have this with truffle mousse on the side which really complimented the steak very nicely.  Delmonico Steak-I had this when I came with my parents and was very happy with my choice. Cooked the same way as the 50 day aged, but smaller (7oz). This was perfect since my dad, being a professional eater, suggested that we go to Quartino's for salumi and pizza PRIOR to having a 5 course meal at David Burke. I don't think I could have handled the 20oz bone-in ribeye. My dad convinced the bubby to order the 20oz steak because ""real men"" need at least 20oz.'s. I think he threw up that night, and I'll just leave it at that.  Slice of Prime-This was very rich and I put me over the edge. Would have been great if I didn't overindulge on the previous courses.

That being said, there were many issues that would prevent me from going back. First, the service. I met a friend there for lunch around 1 on a weekday. She said the hostess ignored her until I arrived. Apparently they ignore single, pretty ladies in their 20s but will respond to a boisterous man's voice. In any case, after calling the night before to make a reservation and learning they did not take reservations, we were told it would be a half hour wait. So we decided to sit at the bar. Thankfully we were able to snatch up the last 2 seats.  The bartender/waiter was terrible! We were sitting at the bar for cryin' out loud, how bad could service be?! But apparently we weren't the most important customers in the place because it took him way too long to take our drink order. Then they were out of Sam Adams beer (how can you be out of a beer that's specifically on the menu as a special?) Then too long to take our food order. Thankfully the food came out quickly.  And one thing about the burger week menu, everything is a la carte. Cheese, $1. ""Asiago/Truffle"" fries were $6 and were a pathetic serving size. Heck, even ketchup and mustard was a la carte and cost $5. So the $5 burger week is deceptive.

The menu is similar to the other few hoity-toity steakhouses I've been to, but with a twist. For instance, the crab cake an appetizer was not a cake, it was a LOG of crab. Different and delicious! I had the beet, honeycomb and mache salad with pink peppercorn dressing; others had the lobster bisque, and the arugula, goat cheese and tomato salad with balsamic. The lobster bisque was verrrry rich and tasted of sherry...mmm. Talk about a meal in a bowl... When our steaks and sides came out, Chris immediately noticed that my classic filet mignon had been covered in blue cheese, NOT my requested order. I was so disappointed, I considered keeping it as not to sit there without a plate of food while everyone nom-nom-nomed on their steaks, but Chris let me keep the steak there, pick at it as I pleased, until my new steak came back out. Well, that was gracious of him...and I'll tell you, the bite I had was outstanding (minus the blue cheese flavor) and quite possibly the most tender, well-seasoned, melt-in-your-mouth bite of steak I've ever had. Too bad it was screwed up and I couldn't eat the rest, not even when I had done my best to scrape the blue cheese nastiness off. My second steak was fine, and only fine--they had rushed it, so the outside was more charred than the slower cooked first steak. Boo. I ate the whole thing anyway?  The sides? My favorite of those we tried were the truffle asiago fries and the tempura green beans--you can always count on the fried stuff! The asparagus and shallots was nothing to write home about, and the cavetelli mac 'n cheese was sort of bland.  But then...dun duhn dahhhh...dessert came. OMIGOD. Creme brulee with fruit sorbet and drunken peaches (I think that's what it was, it was absurdly awesome); freshly made donut holes with salty caramel, pastry creme, and apple ginger dipping sauces; and chocolate mousse cake with s'more ice cream. Every centimeter of the inside of my stomach was filled with dessert extravagance, and I was content. All in all, David Burke's was a solid experience--the staff was gracious, the food (for the most part) thoughtful and well-prepared, the atmosphere sleek and upscale. I'll come back...when I'm very rich and I want a redo on that steak.",0.9932,0.842,0.121,0.036,0.5023516414141413

The Best Dishes: The starting pancakes were Delicious without syrup; the desserts were quite nice, especially the house made vanilla ice cream; the salmon was tasty.  The Worst Dishes: well, all the rest. The mac and cheese = tasteless. The mini filet burger = overcooked. The lamb meatballs = dry.  The Service: The staff was really nice. But we weren't really sure who was our primary server. At best guess there were 4-5 faces serving us.  The Booze: the $10 all you can drink mimosa/champagne could really be worth it!

2009-10-14,1.0,"This was our first trip to Chicago. My wife and I were looking for a good steak dinner. The concierge overwhelmingly recommended David Burke's for steak. Burke's is adjacent to the hotel we stayed at (the excellent pet-friendly James hotel).   I think the guy must have been getting a commission on hotel guests he sends over. Despite all of the romance and hype (Himalayan salt room, hand picked cows, dry aging, best steak award for 2008, etc.), the experience was disappointing.  The food:  2 / 5  I chose the 55-day bone-in ribeye, my wife had a 28-day fillet.  Honestly, there was very little taste difference between them.  My steak may have been more tender, but the difference between them was at best subtle.  We ordered medium-rare, but received rare.  The steak was SCREAMING to be seasoned.  It was two notches above tasteless.  Sides (mushrooms, spinach, potatoes) were OK, dessert (sorbet) was good. Service:  1 / 5 A non-descript, grey haired, 50-something guy served us.  Monotone,  impersonal, pompous and uncaring all at the same time.  No quality checks at any point during the evening.   Value: 0 / 5 $390 bucks for a below average dinner including a $100 bottle of wine.  They included a comment card with the bill, which i GLADLY filled out. Since two weeks have passed, and no one from the restaurant has made an attempt to contact me, it's likely the card hit the trash can before we left the restaurant.  We spent $720 the next night at Charlie Trotter's, but received one of the best meals of our lives.  Value is all in the eye (or stomach) of the beholder.   Summary: Give this place a pass.  We won't go back.  Our dog, however really enjoyed the remainder of my aged 55-day steak.  She rated it 5 / 5.",0.9887,0.787,0.163,0.05,0.4886111111111111

2009-10-08,3.0,"I felt this place was only a little better than average, but that may be because we didn't order steak. Maybe their steak is really, really good but I wouldn't know since I don't eat beef. I really enjoyed the ambiance and decor. Since we were dining on a Thursday evening, there weren't a lot of people except for some hotel guests, couples, business men, and a group of middle-aged men having a boy's date night (how cute). My sister and I were seated at a huge booth for a party of six, which was awesome because we had all this extra room to ourselves; but it was right next to an A/C vent, so we were freezing... We ordered from the lunch menu even though we were dining at 9:30 pm. The chef was nice enough to accommodate us. I don't recall the names, but we ordered a chicken sandwich and a tomato pasta; both were pretty good, but not jaw-dropping-worth-the-expense good. We also ordered a dessert (refer to my photo), which was really good but paled in comparison to the complimentary cookies given to hotel guests during turn-down service. NOW THOSE COOKIES WERE JAW-DROPPING GOOD. My only complaint is that although our waitress was friendly, she was a bit incompetent towards the end of our meal. I saw her walk from the kitchen to the cashier and began chatting with a male server, with our dessert in hand. I just kept thinking about her spit going all over our dessert since she was just chatting away. She was there for awhile, until she saw the manager looking at her, and finally brought us our dessert. Obviously, the ice cream in our dessert was already melted, to say the least. I was originally going to give David Burke's 4-stars but because of that incident, I'm going to have to deduct a star.

We arrived about 30 minutes early for our 8p reservations. They were not able to seat us, even though there were open tables in half the restaurant. I was tempted to go elsewhere.  After eating here, I wish we had. The menu gives you steak options based on amount of time the meat is aged. The longer aged, the higher the price. They impress you with the details about their own farm in Kentucky with grass fed cattle and the name of the main breeding stud. We decided to go with a 40 day aged ribeye for $55 a la carte with cream spinach, asiago truffle fries and potato waffle as sides for $19. Our medium rare steak was served charred, medium and flavorless. It did not taste seasoned, dense texture and no marbling...only fat on the sides. It reminded me of a bland sirloin from our local grocery store. All the sides were mediocre at best. We returned the potato waffle because it was too dry and the replacement was the same...it's an interesting concept, but poor delivery. Fries were served cold and spinach was too pastey. The highlight of this meal was the complementary huge popovers served with Himalayan salt sprinkled butter.  Don't waste your money here for dinner.

For sides, the mac and cheese is fabulous, and for dessert...I highly recommend The Elvis (this banana cake/peanut butter ice cream/bacon thing - trust me, it's good), the donuts (which you fill yourself with little squirt bottles), and I will be dreaming about the salted caramel ice cream for the rest of my life.  It is NOT cheap, but what steakhouse is?

The funny thing about Yelp is that you can do a fair amount of research before you finally sit down at the table.  That said, it was no surprise that the service, pre-dinner rolls, kobe beef sashimi, salmon/tuna tartare and wine list were phenomenal.  Then came the reason we booked in the first place: the meat. I had to go all in and get the 55-day dry aged ribeye (med rare), my wife got the special 15-day dry aged 10oz. filet mignon (medium).  Both were ridiculous.  The famous ribeye perfectly cooked and the closer you get to the bone, the nuttier the flavor of the meat.  Hard to describe but a culinary treat that I don't expect to find anywhere else. My wife's filet was equally good with a very powerful flavor to this cut on special.  She ordered the blue cheese mousse as a compliment to the meat, which we both agreed helped to cut a bit of the aged flavor.  A perfect blend.   The chorizo whipped potatoes were forgettable, a bit too spicy and  heavy.  However, I'd go back just for the tempura green beans served with teriyaki sauce.  They put some sort of seasoning in the tempura batter that is almost curry-like.  Very good. We received a complimenary dessert (due to our anniversary) and it happened to be what we would have ordered anyway: a slice of the Prime chocolate cake.  Unique toasted marshmallow frosting on top, served with chocolate chip sorbet.

Another friend got the bone-in filet, and wished they had just gotten the classic filet.

For sides we order two orders of the truffle asiago fries (to die for), and an order of creamed spinach (delicious), chorizo whipped potatoes (spicy, didn't personally care for them but everyone else liked them), and garlic green beans.

2009-08-11,5.0,"Ferris Bueller, you're my hero...  Chicago is a Mecca of fine dining establishments.  This by far is the best meal I've had in the windy city yet.  Heard about this restaurant through the show Steak Paradise on the travel channel.  David Burke's Primehouse is located on the first floor of the James Chicago Hotel just off of the Magnificent Mile.  While trying to be as economical as possible, we decided to do lunch (11:30 - 3:00) instead of dinner.  Dinner prices are comparable in range to any fine dining establishment here or in Los Angeles.  For lunch, the Primehouse offers Burke's NoBull Feast - this is all you'll ever need for lunch or dinner in terms of quality, quantity, and price.  It's a three course meal starting from $20.09.  The price increases a bit if entrees of specialized beef cuts are desired. The bread was a cheese croissant puff served in a miniature metal pie cup ( yelp.com/biz_photos/UDo-… ).  When bitten, a vast aroma of melted cheese and warm yeast engulf your tonsils.  So utterly satisfying, second servings were ordered all around. Appetizers that were ordered and joyously consumed satisfying any critical pallet: - Kobe Beef Sashimi ( yelp.com/biz_photos/UDo-… ).  This was served on a Himalayan salt brick with slivers of mushroom chips and truffle-mayo.  This was outstanding in terms of subtle flavors.  The mayo and bread were perfectly matched by the rich taste of thinly sliced Kobe. - East Meets West Oysters.  2 east coast and 2 west coast oysters served on a bed of crushed ice with outstanding cocktail, mignonette, and fennel granita sauces. Entrees: - Delmonico Steak ( yelp.com/biz_photos/UDo-… ).  A 28 day aged boneless 7 oz cut which is a rib-eye without the bone.   This was infused with the rich meaty flavors expected in a month-old aged steak.  This by far is the tastiest cut of steak around.   Sides were Asiago Truffle Skins (potato skins fried and doused with truffle oil and sea salt topped with parmigiano), and Asparagus & Shallots.  Both outstanding and I have never had better tasting potato skins.  (Extra $5 supplemental charge for the Delmonico.) - 40 Day Dry Aged Steak Burker (play on words) ( yelp.com/biz_photos/UDo-… ).  This 2'' thick burger was juicy and tasty which overtook the rich bacon mayonnaise and toasted potato bun.  Sides were truffle French fires and creamed Spinach. - 28 Day Dry Aged Bone-In 20 oz Rib-eye.  While comparable to any good rib-eye, it didn't quite have the rich flavors of the Delmonico, but still more flavorful than other cuts of meat.  Sides were Asiago Truffle Skins and Tempura Onion Rings (crispy melt-in-your-mouth curry-flavored tempura sweet onions).  (Extra $18 supplemental charge for the Rib-eye.) Dessert, which we purposely made room for this time: - The King ( yelp.com/biz_photos/UDo-… ).  Banana cake topped with chocolate cream, peanut butter ice cream and peanut butter brittle.  I think you get the picture...  On the side was sweet crispy tempura fried bananas.  Nuff said. - Slice Of Prime.  Layers of rich chocolate mousse surrounded by chocolate cake and served with a scoop of fudge s'mores ice cream.  Again, Nuff said. - Gianduja Crème Brulee.  This is a milk chocolate and hazelnut brulee topped with coffee ice cream and caramelized hazelnuts. There are just so many good things to say about this place.  Modern yet unpretentious.  On Sundays they have Prime Sunday (4 courses for $42), and an American Dim Sum Brunch.  I wish I could stay an extra day to try this, but will have to visit David Burke's Modern American Cuisine at the Venetian in Las Vegas instead.  Not sure if a similar menu is served? Service: The prime server was Jerome, who was kind, courteous, and mildly mannered.  This is the winning combination need for having an enjoyable experience, which could be considered an upper-class establishment.  The secondary servers were willing and always on the ball to please.  This meal was a complete delight to the senses.",0.9973,0.85,0.132,0.019,0.5593315972222221
2009-08-09,5.0,"Blog for full review: Arriving prior to our appetizers we first received one of Burke's famous popovers served in a copper sauce pan.  Clearly not made in the pan but a very nice effect, the popover was crispy on the outside and largely hollow on the inside aside from the strong vapors of butter and yeast.  An excellent dinner roll, my aunt complained there wasn't enough substance and that she wished she'd have gotten more than one - of course this was stated before she failed to finish her meal - I think Primehouse is aware of their portion sizes and I'm glad (for once) I didn't fill up on bread. Having a limited (but great looking) number of selections for lunch we ended up getting only 2 different appetizers.  For my mother and sister, they each chose the Lobster Bisque with Green Apple essence and Lobster Spring Roll.  Not overwhelmed with cream and butter like most steakhouse bisques I was very impressed by the quality of Burke's bisque and compare it favorably to the broth-like version we'd had at Crop in May.  Rich and complex with quite a bit of lobster, the brine of the dish was well tempered by the underlying tones of apple and garlic. For my aunt and I we each opted to go with the Pretzel Crusted Crab Cake with Poppyseed Honey, Citrus, Mango-Mayo - in a word, excellent!  Featuring pretzel's lengthwise with a well proportioned crabcake baked and pan-flash finished inside plus notable aromatics provided by spices, the cake itself was both unique and tasty.  What set the dish apart, however, was actually the light accents provided by the mild honey and the creaminess added by the sweet yet savory mango-mayo.  Certainly a novel take on the steakhouse favorite and it worked well. My addition from the dinner menu was served along with my crabcake and was worth every cent of the $18 price (note, the app/main/dessert feast was only $20.09)  Entitled Foie Gras Terrine with Green City Market Rhubarb, Strawberry Pinot Noir Jam, and Toasted Brioche this item was every bit as good as it sounds - better than the foie at Alinea and probably #3 on my all-time list behind The French Laundry and Alto.  While I fully admit to preferring terrine over roast, this version was particularly decadent with the luxurious and creamy liver served beneath a layer of rendered fat/Pinot/Strawberry and topped with chopped, poached, and sweetened rhubarb.  Spreading thin in order to savor I requested extra bread which was delivered, grilled, within 2 minutes. The Lobster Pasta with pea tendrils, morels, and roasted shallot butter.  While the pasta itself was largely boring and a little soft for my liking, the shallot butter was superb, the lobster fresh, and the morels...amazing both in quality, quantity, and texture.  Quite frankly, in Columbus the Morels and lobster on this plate alone would've cost $20.09 at Whole Foods. The Tempura Shrimp Salad with Cucumber, Carrot, Bell Pepper, Ginger Soy.  Vibrant, enormous, flavorful, and featuring very fresh vegetables with an incredible texture I was very impressed by this dish despite not being a ""Salad for a main"" kinda guy.  The Tempura Shrimp were ginger glazed prior to frying which added an unexpected and pleasant degree of complexity. The Pan Roasted Chicken with basil whipped potatoes, asparagus, roasted garlic jus and when it arrived all I could think was ""chicken - are you sure it wasn't a turkey?""  Quite honestly, the dish was enormous - and I can eat!  A whole half an Amish chicken, easily 3/4 lbs of potatoes, a half bundle of perfectly poached garlic accented asparagus, and an ample helping of chicken/garlic pan jus.  Well cooked, great tasting, probably the best chicken I've had in half a year or more - superb. The Gianduja Creme Brulee with Milk Chocolate Hazelnut Brulee, Coffee Ice Cream, Caramel Hazelnuts.  Though not a big fan of crème brulee in general, having experienced Gianduja multiple times in the past I expected this to be good - and excellent it was.  The ""worst"" of the desserts, I still preferred this to anything we'd had at Spiaggia the night before and found the flavor much akin to nutella with a hearty coffee ice cream that featured great top notes of hazelnut.   ""A Slice of Prime"" described as layers of chocolate mousse, chocolate cake, and fudge s'mores ice cream I found the presentation with a dense chocolate bulls-head lollypop quite attractive.  Thick, rich, almost too decadent for one the cake was actually great on its own but enhanced to a new level by the ice cream which helped to not only cut the sweetness but also to add a degree of nuance to the dish with its notably ""marshmellowy"" tones. ""The King"" - Banana Cake, Chocolate Cream, Peanut Butter Ice Cream, Peanut Bacon Brittle, Tempura Banana.  Just read over those ingredients and tell me how this could possibly be anything less than awesome?  Sweet/savory,  hot/cold, chocolate/peanut butter, soft/crunchy...with bacon.  Dense cake, hefty cream, smooth ice cream - perfect.",0.9996,0.769,0.208,0.023,0.60494442301373
2009-08-06,2.0,"After seeing David Burke's Primehouse ""hyped"" on the Travel Channel, my husband wanted to eat there on a recent weekend visit to Chicago. We quickly discovered that the restaurant is mostly hype and very little substance.  The steaks were tasty, but absolutely nothing special. After the meal, we left the restaurant hungry although we had just spent $200 on two steaks (mine very small), three sides (all tiny and very bland--although laughably described as ""generous portions"" by our server), one minuscule dessert (literally consumable in three bites), one drink each, and no appetizers or coffee. Yes, we were aware of the prices before we went, but who expects to still be hungry after spending that much?  The service was mostly pleasant, but the bartender did not know how to make the (basic) mixed drink I ordered, and still got it wrong after looking up the recipe on the internet.

I would be willing to give it a shot again but would be more careful about what i ordered.  For 3 people the bill was expensive and given my experience not justified.,0.9778,0.758,0.19,0.052,0.6498621794871795

Steaks - My boyfriend upgraded and got like the 45 day aged steak for like $20 more.  His was really really good, well seasoned, well cooked, juicy.  I got the filet mignon and I gotta say I was really disappointed.  I ordered mine medium well, but it came out well done and it was DRY!  Not very seasoned.  Boo.  Maybe I had hyped it up so much in my mind that it just didn't meet my high expectations.  So 4 stars mainly because he enjoyed his meal so much.

I arrived early and enjoyed a glass of the house white sangria in the lounge, which was a nice aperitif on a hot summer day.  We were promptly seated at a good table and quickly received some freshly baked poppers. The bread was nicely light in texture and adding some good quality butter made them even more delicious.  We both ordered two medium rare, 40 days aged bone-in rib-eyes ( the 55 days old was not available) along with creamed spinach and whipped potato.  It was a Monday night and the restaurant was 2/3 empty so we figured our steaks should get some extra loving. However, when they arrived we both discovered they were more on the medium well side than the medium rare we had ordered. The high quality of the beef though was evident despite being a touch on the dry side from overcooking. The California cab our waitress had recommended nicely complimented the beef.

My boyfriend got the bone-in rib-eye, aged 40 days.  It had a really good beef flavor.  My family also split the Bone in Chateaubriand For Two.  I thought that was probably the most flavorful cut that we ordered.  Though they had got it medium well, there were definitely slices near the middle that were much more medium rare - those were the best. The sides are nothing to write home about and can totally be skipped.  The hash browns were soaked in oil and the garlic spinach was forgettable.  The caesar salad made table side was quite nice, and I recommend splitting one order or so for every two people. Dessert was pretty great.  We got the cheesecake lollipop tree which was perfect for splitting.  It came with a cute little dish of whipped cream for dipping.  We also got the Elvis ice cream sandwich - two thin slices of banana cake coated in chocolate with peanut butter ice cream in the middle, all topped with fried banana.  It was quite intense and maybe a little more than we needed. Service was decent.  The waitress was very friendly though she was super busy and would often disappear for long periods at a time. I'm docking a star because we made reservations but they still made us wait for 30 minutes before they could give us a table.  This was annoying because the hostess couldn't tell us when our table would be ready and the waiting area was very crowded.  Oh well.  Considering the prices and the fact that I haven't tried other Chicago steakhouses, I probably won't be coming back to Primehouse anytime soon anyway.",0.9916,0.784,0.161,0.055,0.5439583333333333

2009-06-01,3.0,"I waffled on the star rating, but ultimately I feel that there are several other Chicago steakhouses who do everything better.  Burke's is satisfactory on most points but fails to excel in any of them. Atmosphere:  I didn't notice the decor because I have a bum eye right now.  But I have three complaints about the interior here.  First, it is LOUD.  To hear our server, standing right beside our table, I had to concentrate on his mouth and fill in the gaps with lip-reading.  And ask him to repeat himself several times.  Second, the tables are too wide by at least 8 inches; I felt so far away from my friend that it really detracted from our enjoyment.  Third, this is a design quibble (a la the orange chairs at Otom), but the table tops are red leather.  Really?  Red leather?  Ugh. Befores/sides:  We shared the quail ravioi--very good.  The quail egg on top of the middle ravioli piece raised that bite to divinity.  We also shared the beet salad, which was excellent, except that one of the drizzles was honey--too sweet for beets.  I loved the cheese-puffs that they passed out in lieu of regular bread.  We choose poorly on our sides, as both were boring and subpar:  broccoli with goat cheese and red onions (too lemony and otherwise bland) and the cavatelli macaroni and cheese (the sauce was sort of pasty, and again, bland). Steak:  [sigh]  It's all I really want when I come to a steakhouse.  The rest is all ancillary.  Well, first, they were ""out"" of my preferred steak (porterhouse).  Hey Mr Burke--if I am willing to pay you $53 for a steak, why not keep it in stock?  We're not talking about market-fresh seafood here; this is a dry-aged steak, so why can't you manage your inventory better? So then I had to make a snap decision on a second choice, and, despite leaning toward the Kentucky Ribeye, I ordered the 35-day Kansas City sirloin on the strenuous recommendation of our server.  ""You won't be disappointed.""  Yet, I was.  It was cooked perfectly (slightly on the rare side of medium) but it just didn't taste that good.  It wasn't...steakey enough.  Now I realize why they have so many sauces ($4 each) and why the waiter tried to push them on us--the meat is less than stellar and needs to be obfuscated!  Perhaps that's overstating it, but I WAS truly disappointed by the steak.  [sad face] Dessert:  The King!  I typically do not like peanut-butter sweets, especially if they include chocolate.  However, this dessert was amazing.  Deep-fried bananas and bacon-infused peanut brittle atop a peanut butter ice cream sandwich....heaven on a plate.  SO SO SO delicious.   Service was satisfactory but not great.  Overall, I would come back if someone else were the impetus (and were paying) but there are far better steak choices even within walking distance.",0.9976,0.76,0.184,0.056,0.49446461276818426
2009-05-31,3.0,"David Burke's is not really a date spot as the tables seemed oddly long so you are sort of far away from your fellow diner.  Subtle touching and quiet nothings are thus out.  However, if you are with a larger group of, say, coworker on a business dinner, this may be your place.  As long as everyone is a able to project their voices somewhat - the place gets loud as it fills up. As you are seated, the sommelier is wandering around to help you chose a wine to complement your meal.  She was great - very approachable (wine has a certain snooty edge to it, you know?).  No snootiness here, just solid advice. We started with the quail ravioli.  Three pieces of ravioli surrounded by beans and roasted garlic.  The first thing I tried was one of the beans.  My dining companion said it best when he commented that if the beans were that good, the ravioli was going to be incredible.  It was.  The quail was very tender, not gamey.  The best bite was the piece of ravioli topped with a quail egg.  The egg was prepared a little runny, so the yolk mingled with the meat.  Delicious. The salads are served with a poofy piece of bread.  It looks like a bread-souffle or a small bread-mushroom cloud.  After seeing them on our neighbors' tables, I was excited for us to get ours.  We inquired, and the bread was then rushed out on plates.  Everyone else got them in cute little tins.  I know this doesn't affect taste, but... but I want a cute little tin just like everyone else!  ::pout:: At this point we split the beet salad (Dining Companion is something of a beet-aholic).  It was decent.  I'm new to the world of beets, but my favorite beet salad still resides elsewhere, at another restaurant.  I would have liked it more if the beets were cut finer.  Big chunks seem less appetizing, in my opinion. Next, the fillet.  I hope you are sitting down, Native Midwesterners, because I order mine medium-well.  I also let them butterfly it so it could come out with Dining Companion's meat (gasp!).  This may have utterly negated your opinions of my reviews of steak places, but I order this cut done this way everywhere, so I'd say I have a pretty standard basis for comparison.  That said, this fillet was good, but not the best I'd ever had. The absolute best part of the meal was dessert.  We ordered The King.  A peanut butter ice cream sandwich topped with fried bananas.  Exquisite.  The peanut butter ice cream was fantastic, and the fried bananas were the perfect complement.  Elvis would be proud.",0.9969,0.823,0.162,0.014,0.5681604676502636

We were seated quickly, cocktails were delicious, I tried the Kobe Beef Shashimi (I've been waiting for this for a while!) and it was delicious. We had the crab cake, and both raved about how interesting the flavor combos were in everything we were eating. We then had a table side Caesar Salad with anchovies--also delicious, just like in Italy! We ordered two different Cabs, and awaited the climax: the steaks. I convinced my mom to go with the 55-day aged, and I went with the 35-day aged because I prefer leaner steak. And we waited, talking about how lucky we are to be at this place during such a bad time in our country. Ok, I don't know how to put this lightly, but the steaks came out, cooked to perfection, but COMPLETELY UNSEASONED. Nope, not kidding. At first we thought maybe we were just crazy and they needed some salt. So we put salt and pepper on them, but they were just OK. The 55-day aged definitely had a richer, deeper flavor than the 35-day one, but they were incredibly bland. I let the waitress know that they were unseasoned. She came back a few minutes later and told me that she can take my steak and have them season it. So apparently they seasoned it and put it back on the grill and gave it back to me, no longer rare like I had ordered. But at least it now tasted like a real steak. Really good steak, but I had pretty much lost my appetite at that point. She even made a joke like ""whoops, i guess they forgot"". She said they use rendered fat with seasoning before they grill and they must have just forgot. And we were compensated in no way for this. I didn't want to make a stink in front of my mom for her birthday. But I mean seriously, not even a free glass of wine or anything. Nothing.

It would prove to complement our meal well. For appetizers, we ordered veal sweetbreads and foie gras, two things I had never tried. After having tried the foie gras, I can say I am not a big fan. I have no basis for judging the foie gras I tried this evening, but it was tender, with a strong liver flavor. Likewise, I have no basis for judging the sweetbreads. They were somewhat bland, but not offensive. Presentation on both was outstanding. I had the 55-day aged ribeye, cooked medium rare, and it was a good steak. Perhaps it was not the best I've ever had, but it ranks up there. Mike had the ""South Side filet"" that was bone-in. I tried the filet, and that was also a quality steak. We had creamed spinach and basil mashed potatoes on the side, both were rather bland.

2009-04-04,4.0,"Nested in the first floor of a well-positioned hotel that I had never heard of, Primehouse is clearly meant as a place to ""see and be seen"". They have decent-to-generous portions of extravagantly priced food, with some good flairs; they dry age their own beef in a salt cavern that they've made with pink salt blocks that they imported from somewhere (I've been told four or five times, and I still can't remember where). Their dishes often have a whimsical component, and the more whimsy, the less content; one of their signature appetizers, the ""Angry Lobster"", is tasty and pleasant, but is more show on the plate than lobster meat for the eating. Even the complimentary bread has that whimsy to it; there are no loaves of bread, but everyone gets served a popover, mostly hollow, in a little copper pan; a brick of butter with a little coarse pink salt (sense a theme here?) serves as your ""accessory"" for the popover, though why and how you butter a popover I still cannot figure out. I am especially fond of their Kobe beef tartare, made with a truffle cream sauce and toasted shallot slices, served over a brick of the pink salt from the cave. (We'll ignore the fact that it's pretty clearly not actually Kobe beef, but ""merely"" Wagyu beef... but anyway). Like the enoteca fad that has hit Chicago of late, Primehouse serves their wine in little quartino carafes so you can sample many different varieties during dinner; too bad their wine list isn't actually so worthy as to have many wines you'd really want to sample. Their dry-aged meats really are quite nice, and they offer a choice of seven or eight different sauces, creams, and soufflés on the side to augment the dishes; I am fond of the truffle cream, worth the $3 or $5 surcharge, and their 207L complimentary steak sauce. (Avoid their ""standard"" steak sauce at all costs; it's sugary and pretty horrid, and a great way to ruin their otherwise fine meats.) The peppercorn sauce is quite nice as well, though my dining companions usually enjoy it more than I do. Their ""South Side"" bone-in, oversized, lightly dry aged filet mignon is a nice hunk of meat; I've eaten there a few times now and I still think it's my favorite, despite having tried several different cuts. They make a big deal with lots of marketing literature that all their meat comes from a common ancestor, a bull they personally own: 207L, sitting at their fields in Kansas. I personally think it's way overhyped, but I suppose there is something to be said for a known source for your beef, both in terms of location and genetics. Still, one wonders if he isn't borrowing from the coastal overhype of mad cow disease a tad. Desserts are unilaterally lousy, and even though we have yet to escape without getting given a complimentary dessert, usually a signature one (like the David Burke dipped cheesecake lollipops), we have yet to enjoy one, even though in total, I've tried bits of four or five of their sweet offerings. Frankly, I'd rather just have another Kobe beef tartare. The atmosphere of the place is leathers and woods, though not so much so that it only appeals to ""old rich white republican men."" They're definitely trying to make it an ""in"" scene; being pretty seems to get you a better shot at a better table, and quicker. When we went on the Monday night of the National Restaurant Association show, it was absolutely packed; clearly it was seen as an ""in"" place, and David was being ferried from table to table to meet with industry movers and shakers. Even as busy as it was, though, our usual waiter (Scott) did right by us and took good care of us, which was a good sign. Pros: Locally dry-aged prime beef from a known common ancestor. Solid service. Cons: Price not commensurate with quality in many cases. ""Cuter"" items have disproportionately small portions.

2009-03-03,4.0,"So when you add a dozen oysters, a few martinis, foie gras, a bottle of wine and coffee to the $32 restaurant week menu, it no longer becomes a ""deal"" for the meal, but it does make for a pretty incredible evening! We showed up early for our 7:00 reservation and were sent to the bar to wait- a bar? Fine by me!  I was presently surprised to see they stocked my favorite vodka, Hanger One, and proceeded to have a martini or two while waiting.  The bartender made great drinks, was friendly and gave us some h'orderves to munch on while waiting. As with my previous restaurant week experience, while waiting at the bar, no one ever came to get us.  When I checked back, well after our reservation, they offered to seat us right away.  I don't know, maybe restaurant etiquette has changed, but if someone tells me to wait at the bar and they will come to get me, I don't think I should have to check back.  Oh well. While I had expected someone a bit snootier, we were greeted by an upbeat and funny waiter.  We all wanted oysters and did not want to choose that option for our first of the three courses so we ordered one dozen for the table.  They have 4 different choices of sauce; a dill ice, fennel red wine mignonette, cocktail sauce and horseradish.  We enjoyed everything and the slimy mollusks disappeared quickly. For my first course my friend and I both ordered the Kobe beef sashimi- it was served atop a salt block with truffle aioli on the side- it both tasted amazing and was present beautifully.  My boyfriend got the pretzel crusted tempura battered crab cake. The presentation was really interesting- it was all tied together with a bit of nori, he let me try a bit and it was very good.  For the mains we all got steaks, the boys got the Delmonico and  I got the New York Strip.  The menu offered an ""economic stimulus"" of adding foie gras to the steaks for an additional $15 and both boys jumped on this offer.  While, I chose to keep my steak free of the additional fat, they were nice enough to share with me.  We shared a pretty good bottle of Rioja recommended by waiter.  The sides were served family style and while they looked small we shared them three ways rather well.  The sautéed mushrooms and mashed potatoes were my favorite but the asparagus and spinach were liked by the table as well.  We shared the crème brûlée, slice of prime (chocolate cake) and cheddar apple pie with good strong coffee for dessert.  It was a great way to end an amazing meal!",0.999,0.741,0.237,0.022,0.5859231601731602
2009-03-02,5.0,"Reasons why I am changing my career from the glorious (and oh so exciting) world of market research to waiting tables at David Burkes:  1. The exasperating price of each table's bills will (hopefully) transition into quite a nice tip. Try everything on the menu, learn the spiel about their aging process and having their own shire (I still don't know what a shire is...HELP) and BOOM, instantly double your salary.  2. You get to eat here. Not just during restaurant week. but whenever your Heart desires...  If I didn't have to worry about the pesky nuisances of life, like paying rent, having insurance, buying clothes, etc. I may just work there principally on the basis of Number 2.... that's how in love with it I am.  Ive said it before, I am not a steak eater. And, yet, i feel obligated to say that the 28 day Delmonico was the best hunk of cow I have ever had. The steak-aficionados with me concurred. (My BIGGEST mistake: Getting mine medium-well...even if you are no a fan of pink, doing this will really negate the flavor)  As it was restaurant week (spectacular, but our waiter told us that it is very similar to the lunch special they offer....) we got an appi and dessert also, with family style sides.  I probably debated for a week over what I was going to get for the first and final course. I ended up with the lobster bisque (recommended by our waiter) and the apple cheddar pie. Such great decisions, but as I tried my companions' Kobe sashimi and crab cake and chocolate cake for dessert, everything was spectacular, so it wouldn't have mattered anyway.  Drinks are pricey, to be expected. Our waiter told us Sunday nights are 50 percent off a bunch of bottles of wine, so this would be a good bonus.  Since DBs is in a hotel, valet is astronomical. Take a cab or public trans, if possible.  End of review, need to begin filling out my wait staff application...",0.9899,0.85,0.125,0.024,0.5670521541950113

The 55 day aged ribeye is sublime - perfectly seared to medium rare, the flavors were intensely beefy, with a hint of mineral cast that really hits the palate.  The 28 day aged delmonico is also a fine piece of beef.

The kobe beef sashimi was probably the best we tried, but the truffle-mayo completely overpowered the beef. I'd recommend ordering this and skipping the mayo. The oysters were very fresh. Among the entrees, the burger (40 day dry aged steak burger) was by far the best...better than the petite filet or dry aged sirloin. If you were choosing between the sirloin and the filet, I'd go with the sirloin. It had a better flavor and, unlike the filet, contained no visible fat. The 40 day dry aged burger is EASILY the best burger I've ever had and I'd imagine the best in the city. The flavor of the aged meet is unsurpassed. The desserts were all very good and highly recommended. If you want an incredible burger, good appetizers, and very good desserts, this DB Primehouse is a great choice.

The best appetizer by far was the kobe beef sashimi. It melted in my mouth. Beautiful. The oysters were good too. The crabcake and lobster bisque was allright.  For our entrees 6 of us ordered the Delmonico Steak. Me and my friend ordered them Medium Rare. When the food came out - it looked very different. My friend had a great piece - red and juicy. Mine was overcooked - medium and much smaller. My other 2 friends got the steak with 75% pure fat. When they cut off the fat they had 3 bites left to eat. What a dissapointment!  Also for 12 people they brought out 1 of each side dishes - which was not enough for all of us. I like to enjoy my steak with potatoes. When this experience is limited to 1 table spoon serving it doesn't make me too happy. The mushrooms were excellent. The spinach were way underseasoned and bland. One of my friends also found a caterpillar in the martini. While it might prove that the rasperries were grown naturally i don't expect to see them in the drink. After showing it to the manager and spenging $900 for the evening we at least expecting the drink to be comped - it wasn't.  The dessert was just allright. I tried the slice of prime which i found to be a little bit dry. Apple cheddar pie was interesting. Creme Brulee was so so.  Overall - dissapointing experience.

2009-02-26,2.0,"David Burke's was the last stop on my tour of restaurants for Restaurant Week and it was a shame that the week had to end on a slightly sour note. Perhaps NAHA and NoMI set the bar too high, but I left lunch at David Burke's today so disappointed. It was the only of the three restaurants were I felt I was treated differently because I was not paying full price. At least I hope they were ignoring us because of Restaurant Week, because I would hate to think that is how they serve everyone. The service was terribly slow and when the server did find his way to our table he was rushed and uninterested. We waited over 20 minutes to place our orders, we got our appetizers about 30 minutes later. We ordered coffees with our desserts and they arrived as we were taking our last bites. The timing was just wrong. I think the pop-overs and our appetizers were the highlight of the meal. I agree with another reviewer who mentioned the kobe beef sashimi. It was incredibly good. However, the entrees were definitely lacking. We had 3 delmonico steaks (2 rare, 1 medium rare) and 2 filets (medium rare). They all looked completely different (some round, some square, some thick, some thin). There was no consistency in appearance or temperature. My ""rare"" steak was medium on one half and a deep purple raw on the other. It was chewy and poorly seasoned. It was so, so sad. The sides, though tasty, were cold as we scooped them onto our plates. I was just so disappointed and a little sad to have picked David Burke's over all the other choices in the city. The desserts were alright, but nothing special. I thought the atmosphere was strange, as well. Techno/House music was a poor choice for lunch, or anytime really. Our table was also not a fan of their odd mural. Overall, it was just just an ok experience and I am definitely glad we did not pay full price.

2009-02-25,4.0,"You know, people always talk about the best steak experience they had, and I've never been able to relate.  Besides the fact that I'm not a meat person in general, I have never had a steak that I thought was that phenomenal.  My friend swears by Smith and Wollensky.  It was not bad, but it was not great, I was not a huge fan.  Everyone is all the rave about Ruth's Chris.  It was not bad, but it did not blow me away either. My first bite of a 20 oz. 45 dry aged Sirloin at David Burke's, I couldn't help but exclaim to my table, ""holy shit that's good!""  The outside of the steak was charred to PERFECTION.  Inside, the Medium rare was just as the waiter described it, a warm red center that was not over or under cooked by even a second.  The steak tasted like butter.  If the sirloin was this good, I imagine the fattier meats are even better here. I also had the angry lobster here and it was quite good.  The sauce has a kick to it and the lobster was really delicious. I liked it, but I would never have the lobster alone.  The real reason to come here are the steaks, obviously, and it did not disappoint me. Desserts, however, were disappointing.  The chocolate cake was delicious but be prepared for some strong ass chocolate taste.  If you're not a die hard fan, stay away.  The smores ice cream it comes with was not that great.  I also had the apple cheddar pie with caramel ice cream.  The caramel ice cream was TOO sweet and although the apple pie was good, the flavor of the cheddar on top didn't agree with me. The sides were quite good.  The parm fries were totally worth the buy.  The sides that come with your meal were good too.  Mushrooms were okay in my opinion, but my boyfriend loved it.  I really liked the whipped potatoes because they weren't too heavily creamed.   For bread, you get a little popover bread that is light fluffy and deilcious! Apps:  The dumplings are so so.  The short rib one was good but others in my party hated it.  The shrimp dumpling was not good, it had a strange taste to it.  My friend raved about the lobster bisque.  My fave was the kobe beef sashimi.  It comes on a giant salt block and the beef was delicious.  It also comes with couple pieces of bread and a flavored mayo. I don't know what the flavor was but it was so good!  I would give this a try. Service: Okay, it's restaurant week right now so the restaurant is busy, I get it.  However, we still dropped close to hundred bucks a person so we expect good service!  Our server disappeared sometime after the entree came out and it was impossible to flag anyone down.  My friend who wanted coffee with his dessert could not flag down our waiter in time to get one.  Who doesn't ask if a customer wants coffee with their desserts!?! He was justifiably annoyed.  Then, after we finally get our bill, they mess up our billing.  We ask for the problem to be fixed and she only fixes it halfway.  We then wait another ten minutes and cannot locate our server.  Someone had to find a manager and have him find our waiter for us to fix the problem again.  The service toward the end was quite frustrating and it really put a damper on the night for us.  For this type of place, we shouldn't have had to spend the second half of our meal trying to track down a server to no avail.  Ridiculous!   Food-wise, this was the best steak for me in Chicago but this ex-vegetarian's quest for the perfect steak has just begun!",0.9979,0.693,0.202,0.105,0.5488095238095239
2009-02-24,4.0,"Food: 3.5-4 Service: 2.5-3 Ambiance: 3-4 (pending where you sit!) I was lucky to have experienced an enjoyable lunch here during Chicago's Restaurant Week.  My rating for this restaurant for restaurant week would be 4 stars but if it wasn't for restaurant week, I'd give it a 3.5 stars. My reasoning is that you can't go wrong with a 3 course meal costing $22 at this restaurant.  I suggest going to this restaurant w/ a partner in crime as to maximize the variety of dishes you can taste.  FOOD: For appetizers I was able to try their kobe beef sashimi and lobster bisque. The kobe beef sashimi is served over a bar of solid himalayan salt w/ an accompanying mushroom chips and a side of truffle mayo and toasted bread. This dish was deeeelish. At first, I ate the kobe beef with everything on the dish and for my last two bites, I just ate the kobe beef without any of the fixings. The latter is the way to go! The kobe beef has a subtle taste of pure meat and you get a hint of the degree of marble the beef has undergone in spite of those ultra thin slices of meat. If you go here and do not get this dish......c'mon you're not thinking that right? As you're reading this review, your salivating reflexes should begin taking over.  The lobster bisque could have been served a little bit warmer and from the taste, I sense some ingredient to be missing and or overempowering. It's quite difficult to eliminate the ""seafood"" taste from a lobster bisque and in doing so, that would just be both blasphemy yet a remarkable feat. Nevertheless, the dish probably could have been better maybe with a hint of fresh dill. The taste of this dish was as if they took the tips of the claws of the lobster and made a puree of it. I know i'm making this dish seem worse than it actually is but overall, I just feel it could have been prepared better.  For entrees, I tried a petite 6 oz filet and their alaskan king salmon. Both dishes were quite good. Like the kobe beef sashimi, I was able to taste the pure meat flavor of the filet, however, the quality of texture didn't follow through as much. Nevertheless, the taste is memorable and as I'm writing this review right now, I wish I had a 6oz filet from David Burke right now! The King salmon was quite juicy, succulent in the middle of the filet and had an accompanying sauce on top that made me want to figure out what was in it! If you're visiting this restaurant and not feeling like eating meat, then order this dish! For dessert, I tried their ""slice of prime"" and ""Apple cheddar pie"" The slice of prime tastes like it was made somewhere else and not fresh. The apple cheddar pie, while fresh and seems like it was actually made at the restaurant, was just OK. If a restaurant dares to come up with a dish that can make your stomach cringe just from the name of it, it better follow through with the end result! Not so memorable this dish.  SERVICE: A steakhouse of this caliber could afford to have more attentive and knowledgeable staff. When the main dishes came out, it appeared that a staffmember recited a simple laundry list of what we ordered. Albeit this steakhouse doesn't serve too many novel dishes, a little more enthusiasm would have been more appreciated. On another note, while finishing up my last couple of bites of entree and dessert, our waitress kept on asking if we were done. A more attentive person would have realized we were clearly still eating and wouldn't bother to ask on more than 1 too many occasions.  AMBIANCE: Just try to get the booth in the back left corner of the restaurant :) Seats are stylish and comfy.  *The articles and phrases written herein reflect my opinions as an amateur restaurant critique and in no way reflect said experiences here from a personal standpoint, because then, I'd give a rating of 5 stars because I truly enjoyed my lunch here :)  Yes, I'm referring to YOU if you happen to read this. hehe *",0.9963,0.832,0.126,0.042,0.49395003903200624
2009-02-23,4.0,"Every upscale steakhouse chain needs to do the basics properly: a sizzling filet, signature appetizer, unique spin on potatoes and a decadent dessert. Wildfire and Smith and Wollensky's have got it figured out. David Burke's is still working on it. Which is not to say that this primehouse was bad; by no means was I unsatisfied with my meal. Delmonico steak and filet mignon were cooked (medium-medium rare) and seasoned beautifully. My mouth is watering just thinking about those deliciously tender cuts of meat. You'll be glad to be an omnivore at a place like this! Sides were also well-received for the most part. We devoured a dish of pan roasted mushrooms and mashed potatoes with drizzles of basil oil. I enjoyed the asparagus and shallots, but the creamed spinach was the only dish the table unanimously tried a taste of and pushed away. Which brings me to the relatively low points - the kobe beef sashimi had beautiful presentation, but if I wanted a salt lick, I'd be a sheep or something. Surf and turf dumplings? Loved the lobster, the short rib not so much. Even boyfriend, Mr. Meat-and-Potatoes, was underwhelmed by it. If the surf and turf was just surf, it'd be a lot stronger a dish. Popovers with asiago salt and butter? Nix the salt, please! Asides from those trivialities, a butterscotch crème brûlée and slice of prime were the perfect desserts to top off our meal. In fact, the sorbets upstaged the main components of the dishes themselves with incredibly rich, yet delicate and clean flavors.

Main dish- I got the delmonico, my friend got the filet.  Both were average.  We ordered medium rare and got medium, they were both kind of chewey and actually, I felt a little grossed out while eating them, but still finished (note to self: stop eating things just because they're infront of you). The side dishes were ok, I liked the cream spinach but expected more out of the other 3 sides.  A steakhouse should have amazing mashed potatoes and they did not.  (Ruth's chris, for example, has amazing mashed potatoes).  Asparagus is asparagus, whatever.  Mushrooms were boring. Desserts- I loved the salted caramel ice cream on my cheddar apple pie.  The pie was tasty too.  My friend got chocolate cake which I am not a fan of so I will shut it regarding that dish.",0.9956,0.665,0.256,0.079,0.6701955782312926
2009-02-22,4.0,"Hello Chicago Restaurant Week!  choosechicago.com/eatitu… For 1 week only I can eat at restaurants like David Burke without breaking the bank.  Whoo hoo!   David Burke had twice as many reservations last night as a typical Saturday night, but they were well prepared because the service was spectacular!  As far as the food, really good, but not as good as I remember from previous experiences... The popover: They've changed it. GASP!  While this was the highlight of past meals at David Burke (see previous review) this time it was pretty mediocre. Appetizers: Our party of 4 was smart and ordered 4 different apps to share: 1) Oysters: a few sauces to choose from- go with the red 2) kobe beef sashimi- eh, didn't do it for me (but I'm not a meat fan) 3) pretzel crusted crabcake- by far the best appetizer of the 4 4) surf and turf dim sum- one member of our party thought the lobster dumpling tasted way too fishy, but I was a fan Entrees: While the rest of the table went right for the meat, I ordered the salmon. I should probably know better than to order fish at a steakhouse because it really wasn't good! It was topped with a butter anchovy sauce that was SO salty that I need a glass of water just thinking about it. However, my husband raved about his southside filet..so apparently that's the way to go. The entrees also came with 4 sides served family style for the table: mashed potatoes, asparagus, mushrooms, and creamed spinach.  All of them made up for my gross salmon....the mushrooms and creamed spinach were my favorites. Dessert: Butterscotch Creme Brulee.  My husband ordered the white chocolate ice cream sandwich and after one bite of mine said ""oooh that's good- can we switch?""  Mine was way too good to switch, but I did let him steal a few bites...in exchange for some chocolate ice cream from his dessert of course. So while my salmon was a bit disappointing I still feel like I could my fair share of good food for $32.   If you were lucky enough to score yourself a reservation at David Burke for restaurant week I'd recommend the crab cake for your appetizer, southside filet for you entree, and butterscotch creme brulee for dessert. Bon Appetit! Oh, and Mr. Burke...bring back the old popover!! This new oh so called popover isn't fooling me!",0.9976,0.771,0.201,0.028,0.48859079516974235
2009-02-17,4.0,"Dim Sum and Den Sum...haha  As you can tell we went for the Dim Sum Brunch. Let me tell you its seriously more than brunch, more than dim sum, its just more than everything. To me, it almost felt almost like a degustation menu. I walked out of the restaurant feeling that ""I ate too much on Thanksgiving and I want to take a nap now"" feeling. So be forewarned - this brunch is not for the faint of appetites!  The dim sum brunch is not 100% true to the dim sum concept. While they do have carts of food that circle the room, you do not have the option to stop any random cart and say ""I want that"". What happens is ...The servers follow a sequence of dishes to serve - and carts are brought out to designated tables. But, it is true to the dim sum concept as they actually mark off your sheet of the items that were served (even though it is a flat rate for brunch).  As far as the food offerings in the brunch menu...they literally take you through every meal of the day. Starting with traditional breakfast favorites all the way to classic dinner entrees - all served in individual portions. They even throw in some Asian flair, a 'seafood bar', and Southern cooking to the mix. Sooooo much food. But yet, you cannot pass up the signature cheesecake lollipops and fortune donuts!  But I have to say I'm more in love with the concept and the huge selection of food offerings in the brunch menu, than the actual food itself. Its definitely a fun dining experience, especially paired with a mimosa! And I love love love little food. But the food itself missed the mark with me. I guess I maybe had ubber high expectations because nothing really knocked my socks off. I expected better execution on some of the dishes. But in the end, the food was creative and above average than most. I definitely recommend this to go in big groups.  My Favs: Omelet struedel, pancakes, Asian munchies, kobe beef crostini, salmon/tuna tartare, steak au poivre with creamed spinach",0.989,0.843,0.128,0.028,0.4484814814814814

However, my awesome mom had today off because she's a teacher, and schools believe in the concept of national holidays. So she hopped on the Metra and came to visit me downtown for lunch. We ended up at Primehouse because their website mentioned a completely badass-sounding lunch special for $20.09, that included 3 courses. So we figured, sure! And included in this badass lunch deal were the same awesome cheesey popovers that are served with dinner. And the options for lunch are awesome. Mom went with the lobster bisque soup, which had chunks of apples and lobster IN it, and like a big stick of fried lobster meat on top. I went with the surf & turf dumplings - the surf ones had lobster meat and a spicy sauce (and the dumpling ""stick"" was a tiny claw. CUTE!) and the turf was kobe beef with a sort of soy-hoisen sauce. Awesome. In terms of entrees, we both got petite fillets and they were faaaaaaaaabulous. AND! The steak entrees come with two sides apiece - I went with mashed potatoes that involved chorizo, and asparagus, and Mom got mushrooms and potato skins fried in truffle oil, garnished with asiago cheese. And for dessert - Mom got creme brulee, and I got this apple tart that involved cheddar and salted caramel ice cream. Our total bill came to about $54 (there was a minor upcharge for steak) and everything was awesome, and we weren't rushed along, and the service was fantastic. I could totally do this once a week.

2009-01-28,5.0,"Stacey A really captured the backstory behind our Primehouse adventure:  ""We settled on Primehouse, because Jenny was supposed to go a million years ago, and then it never happened - some ordeal with luggage and a whiney boy and blahblahblah. So we decided to let David Burke impress the hell out of us with tasty meats and snacks.""  Emphasis on that last sentence, because impress the hell out of us is exactly what they did. Dry aged steaks make me happy. Happy in the sort of way that makes me think Maslow got it all wrong, and that steak is actually higher up on the pyramid than self-actualization. There's something magical about the dry aging process that makes you feel like your tastebuds have recently acquired superpowers. Super awesome steak-loving powers. That said, even though my 28-day dry aged masterpiece of a meal was cooked (or not cooked, since I asked for blue) to perfection, it was really just one part of a great dining experience. I tried foie gras for the first time at Primehouse. I imagine it was a lot like someone trying beer for the first time after Prohibition ended -- I'd never had it before, so I really had no basis for comparison, but knowing that it had been banned for a while made it just that much better. Of course, it didn't hurt that it was absolutely delicious. The side dishes that Stacey A and I split made me feel just a slight bit guilty for serving something like plain asparagus when I make dinner at home. The garlic asparagus was just perfect, and the truffle raviolis made me go ""hmm"" (in a good way) and completely understand why truffle oil is so trendy with foodies. I enjoyed a fabulous malbec with my dinner (the name of which I can't remember at all, which is kind of tragic). We didn't get a visit from a sommelier, probably because it was a Tuesday afternoon, but our server was spot-on with his recco anyhow, so I didn't feel neglected in the slightest. Speaking of servers? I'd call this the best service I've ever had, no exaggerations. I was honestly expecting a hint of pretension, especially because Stacey A and I are on the younger, less experienced end of the foodie spectrum. Instead, we had impeccable service; our guy was great with wine recommendations, explained the mystique of foie gras to us, was totally cool about Stacey taking a photo of her dinner, and smiled when I got my steak blue (I swear, he would have high-fived me if it weren't for the fact that high-fives are a little out of place here). I'm a gigantic fan of servers at swanky places who treat the twentysomething girls just the same as they do the corporate bigwigs.

The skin was luscious and melted in your mouth.  The caesar salad made tableside was strong on anchovy but very tasty. I had the 55 day aged steak (they were out of 75) and it was great.

2009-01-25,3.0,"I suppose the lore and mythic genius that so many ascribe to DB's (including Chicago Mag, it was their top pick) was a bit lost on our group of four.   5 + stars for the hilariously good times in great company, 4 for the very attentive and knowledgeable staff/service,  and finally a 3 spot for the actual food.   Even taking into account the ""expectations curve"" (which admittedly, was through the roof, we'd all read the rave reviews from ""experts"" and amateur pundits alike) we felt the steak specifically, came up short; as did the sides.   Lobster Bisque was expectedly decadent, velvety smooth with some nice bits of succulent lobster, quite good.  The impeccably prepared Caesar Salad (done table side) was outstanding and speaks to service aspect of the experience....every staff member was 100% on point and  timed almost perfectly.   SIL had the dumpling lollipop thingamajiggies, loved them. I went w. the 40 day reserve Bone-in Ribeye (shoulda went 55 day), the missus had the Delmonico, the SIL and Mr. had the Strip.  All Med to Med Rare and adequately cooked to temp.  The consensus across the board: ""lacked seasoning and overall flavor"".  A bit of a let down, again, considering the flavor explosion we anticipated.   Don't get me wrong, not bad, but for a place that dry ages i'm thinking a more concentrated flavor, it just didn't deliver...and w. so little seasoning (by design, i'm sure) fell short. Also, an inherent issue w. dry aging is risking, well....a dry steak (ok, not dry, but not overly juicy). This would be countered by the condensed flavor you might expect on the upside; not the case here, at least to any discernible degree.   Tbh, I'm partial to wet aging as you do get 1. a steak that is still ""aged"" and 2. a steak that is able to absorb moisture as it goes through the process, producing a juicier steak by comparison. Sides were forgettable and not shareable in size. Popovers good but not outstanding.  Finally, we ordered the chocolate cake pre-meal so it came out piping hot from the oven.  It was pretty tasty, but at this point the wine was more attractive....which was a luscious Tempranillo.  At about $50 a bottle, an easy recommendation.",0.9854,0.881,0.107,0.012,0.6085802469135804

2009-01-10,4.0,"Visit the Salt Cellar with me: youtube.com/watch?v=tKZ0… Hubby got a bonus check so I made reservations to take a bite out of the bull, ""Prime"".  If you want to skip reading too much of this review, then go here, order the 55 day aged ribeye and the Kobe beef sashimi. skip everything else including the expensive wine list. Came here last night on a Friday and had reservations for 8pm.  First off, I was shocked that it wasn't full.  In reading previous reviews, it appeared to be a pretty hot restaurant with a long wait to get seated.  Not for us, it was easy - we walked right in.  Could it be a sign of the economy?  Service was friendly, not snobby at all.  Valet guys were great and very nice. The ambiance - wow, it smells SO good.  I can smell it outside at the valet stand. I don't know how the valet guys do it, smelling that yumminess, day in, day out.  Inside, the seating area isDARK.  So dark that I could hardly see the menu. What is up with that? We went ahead and ordered some apps: Hudson valley foie gras with some fried spring rolls.  Delicious - perfectly seared and rare on the inside.  Rolls were good too.   Not the best foie gras I've ever had but good. Kobe beef sashimi on Himalayan salt rock and truffled mayo - WOW - FOODGASM - I absolutely LOVE truffles and the kobe beef was beautifully presented and melt in your mouth delicious.  this will blow your mind. Crab cake - interesting combination of flavors.  There is some sort of citrus peel in the mixture and it was tasty.  NOT blow your mind tasty. Cheesy bread puff - comes standard.  Loved it...cheesy aromas, soft and tender on the inside STEAKS:  We wanted to order the 75 day, but there wasn't any. there's only a limited quantity available.  The next round of 75 day steaks is ready in about a week.  I would call ahead and check. 3 of us ordered the 55 day ribeye.  I don't typically order ribeye's when I go to a steakhouse because my preferred cut is the filet mignon.  But since I'm here, I might as well order what Chicago Magazine described as one of the top steaks in Chicago. HOWEVER, I do eat ribeye alot at home cuz I can make a mean steak myself.  The ribeye had TONS of flavor.  I ordered it medium-rare and it came out perfect.   Condensed, meaty and tasty.  Texture - I like to describe as flavorful, fatty molecules bursting into my mouth at each chew.  It was really good.  I think the flavor was better than the texture for me - I think I had a little too much grisel in my steak....others didn't complain and they had the same thing. One person went for the delmonico and she said it was very good.  I didn't steal a bite though. I should have. We also ordered two sides, the pan mushrooms and basil whipped potatoes.  I love mushrooms, but I didnt love these.  They didn't have a great texture to them, maybe stewed too long?  We all agreed they were just ok.  As for the whipped potatoes, absolutely delicious.  Dessert - ordered the ice cream sandwich.  Don't bother, not great at all.  Huge disappointment. So, I'm giving this place a 4 star because I can appreciate a flavorful steak.  I'm paying money to eat Prime and I would return just to eat Prime.  I wouldn't return for the desserts or the side dishes. But on a price performance ratio, this definitely failed me because it was EXPENSIVE.  The wine list, according to my husband, didn't have a bottle less than $70.  The final bill was about $150 per person and one person didn't even drink.

My BFs bone in ribeye (20 ish oz) ($under 40) was HUGE and super delicious. I'd never been that stuffed and satisfied at lunch. Also huge pluses: servers were amazing and whoever pours the wine here has the heaviest arm i've ever seen. It definitely felt like a 16 oz pour to me...no complaints here! Oh, and their salted caramel ice cream makes me swoon.",0.9837,0.757,0.198,0.046,0.6921568627450982
2008-12-21,2.0,"David Burke's Primehouse is one of those places where the name out shines the meal. With David Burke you would expect amazing. When I heard they had their own dry aging room to go along with their own bull! How could you mess that up? Well they did.. while this was only my first trip and I will certainly try every place twice. I had a 65 day dry aged medium rare ribeye. The outside would have had a nice crust but it went way over board into burnt. My steak was well done not even borderline.. Plus they were out of reserve cuts so the only thing to replace it would be something non dry-aged. Bah.. but the popover in a measuring cup was certainly the best part. But I almost forgot that the family style caesar salad. Where they ask how you want it made.. Garlic, anchovies, ect.. That was top notch! So the appetizer and salad far out weighted the main focus of the steakhouse. Oh well I will have to try them again!",0.954,0.842,0.133,0.024,0.6439223057644111
2008-12-19,4.0,"I have only tried lunch at David Burke's, where during the weekday they offer a 3 course special for the price of the entree (steak entrees were about $25).  It is a pretty good deal, considering that they serve luxurious appetizers such as oysters, jumbo shrimp, and Kobe beef sashimi.  Portions are most likely smaller than what is served during dinner, but I found it to be more than plenty. Food wise, I tried the Kobe beef sashimi, served on a bed of rock salt (from the Himalayas?).  It was very good.  I also tried the lobster bisque.  It was silky and luxurious.  For the entree, I tried the 28 day aged Delmonico steak (looks like a filet mignon to me), and the Wagyu skirt steak.  Both were really good, though I did not think the aging process made the steak particularly tender.  The entrees came with a choice of 2 sides as well.  I really enjoyed the pan fried mushrooms and the truffled potato skins.  Dessert, I had the butterscotch creme brulee.  It was very good. I was so unbelievably stuffed at the end.  The 3 course special is definitely a great value, but it was way too much food for lunch.  So, remember to starve yourselves before going! In terms of decor, the place is nicely decorated.  Contemporary decor, in line with the theme of The James Hotel (where the restaurant is located), is mixed with traditional steakhouse elements.  The bathrooms are also very nicely appointed.

2008-12-14,5.0,"My family and I celebrated Thanksgiving here and all of us thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience at David's Burke's Primehouse. The restaurant is located inside the James hotel, a boutique hotel in the River North. The restaurant is decorated much like traditional steakhouse with leather and dark wood but with a very sleek and modern style. The service here is awesome from the host to the servers. But what's really important is the food. I have got to say- the food here is amazing! My dad ordered the 55 Day Aged Rib eye which was phenomenal and bursting with flavor! The rest of us opted for the prefixed Thanksgiving menu which included prime rib, turkey, and ham all served family style. The sides included asparagus, green beans, mashed potatoes, stuffing, cranberry sauce (served in a can), and 2 kinds of gravy. Everything and I mean everything was scrumptious! The starter was a choice of a salad or soup and both were delicious. The popovers that they served fresh from the oven were so flaky and oh so good. The desserts were creative and decadent. One savory dessert that we tried was the apple cheddar pie. I enjoyed the creme brulee. I absolutely loved everything here and although it was a bit pricey, I believe it was worth it. Our waiter even gave each of us turkey sandwiches to go, which we enjoyed the next day for lunch. The sandwich was delicious- they stuffed two pieces of white bread with turkey and all the thanksgiving sides (mashed potatoes, stuffing, gravy, cranberry sauce, etc).

2008-12-08,4.0,"So THIS is where all the beautiful people go in Chicago... Drinks are awesome at the bar and you'll definitely be there because there is usually a wait even if you have a reservation.  Try the Glacier - my total favorite - which is Ginger Vodka and is amazing.  It even has small cubes of blue jello at the bottom of the shot which makes the last sip really yummy.  My husband likes the kentucky tea - which has bourbon in it.  I can't comment on it because I hate bourbon, but he does and likes it quite a bit... Now the food... Awesome Kobe Carpaccio to start and the individual Popover they give you for bread is like slap-yo-momma good.  Hubby and I split our steak because I can never eat something that large but also cuz we like to try a bunch of the little side dishes they have - like the Chorizo mashed potatoes (chaching!)   We tried the special which was a 55 day aged 10oz Wagyu Delmonico steak.  You know, the steak was good but it seemed like it was missing something.  I was looking for a bit more seasoning - heck, even some salt or something - to make it even better.  We ordered some Bernaise sauce which did help but I didn't think we should have with a $60 steak. Our waiter was really really awesome and he made the night for us as well.  Overall a really good experience.  Is this the best steak on the planet - not in my opinion, but hey, you know what they say about opinions...",0.997,0.736,0.247,0.017,0.5376543209876543
2008-11-25,4.0,"Yay! I'm not quite a fan, but I will give them four stars for the steak they serve. I happen to be very into red meat.  I know my steaks, whether they be prime, choice, grain or grass fed, Wagyu, or Kobe.  I was very pleased with the dry aged steaks they serve here.  That is the only thing. Service was slow and the sommelier didn't come to our table until after we had polished off four bottles of wine (we had a group of 7) even then, that person insisted we try a much more expensive wine than we had been previously purchasing.  The appetizers were OK.  Beef sashimi was good, but we ordered three for our table and barely had evough for everyone.  We orderd the bacon appetizer?!? How could they go wrong.  We sent it back, the fattiest most tasteless pieces of bacon I have ever had in my life, and for $10 it was a joke.   The steak:  I ordered a 55 day dry aged ribeye.  I like my steaks ""black and blue"" simply meaning that the oustside is darkly charred and the inside is still rare.  Mine was brown and purple; barely brown on the outside and cold on the inside.  This is true test of a steakhouse, because they have to turn the ovens up higher for your steak alone while having to keep a close eye on the other orders.  They failed.  I would have sent it back but....The steak was so damn good!  Keep in mind, when you have a steak that is aged 55 days, it isn't quite a steak anymore, it becomes more like a salami or cured ham.  Like pancetta, the steak is dry but tender and every bit as flavorful. I basically ate the whole steak raw, but it was very tasty.  The marbling was interesting as well.  ususally you see wavy lines of fat through the meat (this is how they classify meat as prime or choice) but the marbling on this steak was like little pencil erasers. I have never seen this type of marbling before, but, once again, it was delicious. Skip the toppings (luxury, Oscar, etc). Not only do they add $15-$30 to the price of your $50 steak, but they are tasteless.  I had the Oscar, asparagus and crab meat paired with bernaise sauce.  The crab meat was very pungent with the smell of the sea. Nasty and after taking a bite, my teeth were crunching down on either salt, sand, shells, or grit.  It was horrible. Thankfully I had it on the side. Other people in my group ordered fish and other items.  We had to send back the salmon, it was too salty, which brings me to my next point. Sea Salt: anyone worth their salt :) would know that if you use large grain sea salt, you either have to grind it up,  or mix it in with something wet like a sauce or even a dressing and let it sit for a minute.  This place used salt on everything, and they just basically threw it on whatever they were salting in these huge grains.  Everyone of us complained of the salt crunching in our teeth.   Come on DB's, you want to charge $900 for a dinner, then get your s%$t together and give us top notch food made by top notch chefs.  I don't need the dishwasher cooking my meat or the bathroom attendant salting my appetizers.",0.9894,0.837,0.114,0.049,0.48624822354330544

For starters, it's about as reasonably priced a brunch as you are likely to find in any hotel, particularly right off Michigan Ave. $35/pp, and an extra $10 for unlimited mimosas, bellinis, and bloody marys. For that $35, you will get more food than you will know what to do with. Parts of the brunch are ""dim-sum"" style, meaning they have big carts that they wheel through the room with dozens of treats on them like oatmeal creme brulee, smoked pastrami salmon pancakes, and kobe beef carpaccio. Once you are done with as much as you want off the carts, they begin bringing out the food from the kitchen; pancakes, eggs bennedict, some Asian themed items, and a lot of fantastic, filling food. The service was awesome. We were treated well from the moment we walked in.

Caesar salad was prepared tableside which was neat but not best Caesar salad I've ever had by a long shot.  Dressing was too mayonnaise-y.  Got the white anchovies on top. Crab cake appetizer was great- no breadcrumb filler, just crab. Beef sashimi was cool presentation- thinly-sliced on a Himalayan salt rock and the sauce was tasty- truffle oil- flavored.

Sides were great, including the truffle asiago fries.  Desserts were also excellent.  I had the chocolate beignet .....yummm!  This place is THE new place for steak in my book, and I can't wait to try the one in NYC, as well as Burke's restaurant in Las Vegas.

2008-10-09,3.0,"I am a huge fan of 207L.  That is the designation of the Black Angus bull at Creekstone Farms who's offspring end up on the dinner table at David Burke's.  The interesting thing about this particular steakhouse is how they control the product from inception (conception?--lol) to the grill.  They purchased the rights to this particular cattle on a single farm and manage the process up to and including dry-aging on-premise in their custom Himalayan sea-salt aging room.  This differs from most other top steak houses, most of which source their meat from Allen Brother's, thus relinquishing a certain level of product control and quality assurance to a vendor. Eating the 40-day Dry Aged Ribeye evokes something truly satisfying on a primal level.  The meat seems to reverse the wheels of evolution to a time when everyone looked like the Geico cavemen.  Delicious.

2008-08-30,4.0,"First off, if you are not prepared to drop over $100 / person, the price of the meal might shock you. Being new in town, I was in search of a great steakhouse. I moved from New York where I tried many of the meat lover joints: Peter Luger's, Ben & Jack's, Delmonico's, Strip House, Smith & Wollensky, and BLT Steak.  After reading reviews, it sounded like David Burke's was the place for true meatlovers. I've had Gibson's and n9ne, so that was my comparison. When I walked into the hotel, it had a pretty laid back bar. There were plenty of seats to lay around while waiting for your party and perfect to grab a drink. I went on a Thursday night and was surprised to find that the place wasn't packed, so our party of 6 were seated promptly.  The atmosphere didn't feel like a typical ""banker"" joint and they played chill music in the background. The place wasn't loud either, so you can hear your company talk without any issues. Enough about ambiance... on to the food! I went with the 40 day dry aged (med-rare, more on the rare side), another couple had the Bone in Chateaubriand for Two (rare), which is basically a double ""South Side"" fillet, and the other couple had a South Side and a 35 day Kansas City. Sides: Chorizo Whipped Potatoes, Truffle Asiago Fries, Asparagus & Shallots, Pan Roasted Mushrooms, and Tempura Onion Rings.  The meat was awesome. I felt like my steak could be a tiny bit more on the rare side, which would have left it a bit more tender, but the 40 day flavor was awesome. I'm not much of a sauce kind of person, but my wife loved their steaksauce (sweet one). It has kind of that cocktail sauce tang to it. I also had the chance to check out the South Side Fillet, which has a wet rub, and it was not as flavorful, but amazingly tender. One couple claimed that this restaurant has jumped to the top of their list for straight up meat in Chitown!  As for the sides, I didn't find any of them particularly great. They were solid, but nothing special compared to what I've had in New York. However, the cheese popovers that are served as bread were awesome! We were going to hit up the cheesecake lollipop tree, but they had a special on a red velvet cake ($24). The girls were drooling for it, so the boys gave in. The cake was solid, again, nothing to blow me away. I'll be back for their famous cheesecake lollipops! Oh, and the sommelier was great. We set a guideline on how much we wanted to spend and she came over with further questions like, do you like tannin? fruit flavors? strength? region preference? Overall, very helpful and we ended up with a beautiful Shiraz. Overall, really good steakhouse for it's meat. Service was fine... a tiny bit slow, but if you have good company, it shouldn't be a problem... i would have gave it 5 stars if the sides  were better.

I started with the beet salad (see pic) which was very fresh and perfectly balanced in flavor.  I knew I needed it to preemptively fiber balance my meal... because I ordered the ""CAVEMAN"" special:  a ~30 oz I think 35 day dry aged tomahawk cut bone-in ribeye (chicago is famous for their tomahawk cut ribeye), served with LOBSTER SCRAMBLED EGGS.   AWWW YEAAH...... cholesterol tastes delicious.  THis was seriously the greatest steak I've had in decades.  I tried some of my dining companions' 55 day dry aged ribeye and it was stupendous--the flavor so intense, and the fat so melt-in-your-mouth tasty. I asked the waiter if we could see the aging room (AJ asked me to do some scouting for him), and the waiter said of course.  We got a guided tour of the aging fridge with Rick Gresh himself, the executive chef.  Rick was super friendly and cool, not a hint of pomposity--totally the type of guy I could just get a beer with at a bar.  Rick showed us how the meat goes from ""fresh"" to ""aged""--that there's no mold involved, it's just a wall of pink salt blocks, and the meat basically digests itself.  When he cooks the steak, there is no marinade--just salt and pepper, and brushed on ""beef love"" (as he calls it) which is a mix of beef drippings and some spices. The service... could have actually used some work though--the waiter was not as attentive as we'd have liked--there were many times when we looked for him, and he was nowhere in sight.  The sommelier was friendly and helpful, decanting my cab I brought from SF for me, and helping me pick out a nice pinot for the table. but the quality of food, and rick's friendliness.... trumps everything.  Check out the pics....",0.9969,0.767,0.194,0.039,0.6079931972789115

Their secret, well, one of their secrets since I'm sure there are many more, is that apparently all of their steaks come from a single bull, and two cows.  They don't really play this part up too much since I guess some people might be turned off by it, but I think it's totally rad.  They found this bull who they've named Prime, who produces offspring of the highest order of deliciousness, and they bought him for some ridiculous chunk of change.  They take his seed, and the eggs from two particular cows, and implant them in other cows who act as surrogate mothers.  The result is an entire generation of cows whose meat is perfectly marbled and full of robust flavor.  Truly better living through technology. Our server was this great wisecracking David Spade look-alike, and after we finished eating, he agreed to arrange a tour of the aging facility in their basement for us.  We were taken down by the head chef, where he personally took us into the freezer room and showed off their racks off aging meat, being flavored as they dried by a whole wall of pink sea salts.  If you go and take the tour, be sure to check out the hunk of two-year aged beef sitting in the corner that they keep around for novelty purposes.",0.9888,0.849,0.131,0.02,0.5082589285714286

The others in my party had other cuts including the South Side filet and classic filet - all were prepared to instruction and much enjoyed. The sides were slightly lacking however, but were certainly secondary to the meat (creamed spinach, tempura green beans, and truffle Asiago fries).  The real highlight of the evening for me however, was the Caesar salad with white anchovies. The table side preparation I can take or leave, but it was quite possibly the best Caesar salad I've had. The dressing ingredients were expertly balanced and the anchovies were a perfect accompaniment, delicate and flavorful.

2008-04-27,2.0,"This review is for the dim sum-style brunch on Sundays.  Overall, the experience rates 2.5 stars.     4.5 to 5 stars for the presentation, especially the staff pushing around the carts.  They were super friendly and funny, and did their best to describe and pitch whatever items were on their cart.   2.5-3 stars for the service.  I know in the restaurant hierarchy of things, servers and chefs aren't rushing to work brunch.  It's not sexy, it doesn't get the big headlines like dinner does.  But at a restaurant as vaunted as this one, I don't think you should have to ask your server for water.  Staffing wasn't the key--the restaurant is ridiculously overstaffed, with at least 2-3 people per table.  Our main server was absent for long stretches of time, and although we didn't feel neglected (the busboys came by frequently to pick up our used dishes), as I said, you shouldn't have to ask for a refill, they should notice these things and bring the H20 by in regular intervals.  That having been said, our main server was perfectly nice and as a plus, he forgot to charge me for my $8 pot of tea.  (This reminds me to bitch about something else--had I actually ended up paying for my pot of fancy ""Secret Orchid Oolong,"" it would have been nice to be asked if I wanted another pot of hot water.)  In other words, the service at brunch should be as good as at  dinner.  The service as we experienced it today was pleasant but pretty inconsistent and at times vexingly absent-minded.  Lastly, another reviewer noted that their server made a point of telling them they could have seconds of whatever they wanted.  Our tablestaff did no such thing.  The tacit impression was that we got one shot/one pass at each serving/course/cart.  In normal dim sum, the same food items come by again and again.  In Primehouse dim sum, you see the carts several times, but after they hit your table, you're metaphorically dead to them.  For $35 a person, I should be able to have seconds--nay, thirds--of whatever miniscule portion I want to.  This leads me to point # 3. . . 2.5 stars for the food.  Much of the food was OK; much was very, very good, especially the desserts.  However, given the reputation of the restaurant and the fact that it's $35 a head, I expect the food to be better than the $20 a head breakfast buffet at the Hilton.  Many of the items were of the same (middling) caliber.  The crab balls were good, the smaller-than-silver-dollar size pancakes were average-to-mediocre.  I'm gauche enough to admit that I'm more magnanimous when I know I can have all I can eat.  But if you're left with the impression that you get one serving of your oatmeal creme brulee and that's it, the aforementioned creme brulee better be off the chain.  This one was not.  Lastly, we never were never served the infamous fortune doughnuts much talked about in the other Yelp reviews, nor were we offered the cheeseburkers, which isn't a very attractive name for a dish let me say.  Shame on you, Primehouse.   Shame on you.   In sum [no pun intended, because it's a dim sum review, ha ha], if you're from out of town like we are and have a gift certificate from OpenTable to mitigate some of the expense, AND your server forgets to charge you for that $8 pot of tea, then by all means, eat here for the experience once.  Otherwise, leave dim sum to the experts (the Cantonese), who do it perfectly fine, thank you very much, and don't feel a need to charge you $35 a person for the privilege.",0.9924,0.84,0.118,0.042,0.5012975243147657

2008-03-17,5.0,"Dim Sum Sunday Brunch - very detailed!! We arrived at about 12:10 PM for our Noon reservation, the hostess was cute and friendly, she greeted us right away, asked if we had a reservation and promptly seated us.  I found her to be casual but appropriately dressed for a Sunday.  After we were seated, we immediately noticed the carts but were confused and didn't know what to do.  Do we approach the carts?  Do the carts come to us?  We didn't have a server approach us and it took nine minutes before I pulled a bus boy over and asked what we were supposed to do.  He asked if we had a server and I said ""no"".  The busser went to get someone right away.   Rory approached our table shortly after the busser went to get someone, apologized and made us laugh. He didn't make excuses for why no one had approached the table, Rory simply made an effort to correct the situation - I thought he handled it professionally and I appreciated his honesty.  Rory asked if we were doing the dim sum brunch, I said ""yes"" but he assumed we knew what was going to occur. I asked him to please take us through the process and he did.  Brunch and Crunch Everything was very uniquely presented with very small portions.  The portions sizes were perfect for me and my friend (who was male) also thought the portions were appropriate.  We both liked that seconds were available if we so desired.  The staff made sure that we were aware that we could have as much as we liked but they also made the point that there was a lot of food on the way.  Smoked Pastrami Salmon was delicious (Rory brought this out ASAP because we had been waiting).  Oatmeal in egg was adorable but too sweet and kind of thick.  I was not a fan of the pancakes but this dish may make sense for kids.  Eggs Benedict were delicious, the staff was kind enough to make me one without meat. Friend had the western omelet and really liked it. The Asian Cart This was my favorite cart, I was happy with the selection.  The server pushing the Asian Cart on this particular day/time was great.  Very friendly, she had brown hair and blonde bangs.  The tempura green beans were not my favorite but my friend enjoyed them. I thought sauce was too thick.  Dumplings: all tasty, my friend thought they were the correct temperature, however, for me, they were slightly cool.  My friend reported that The BBQ pork had more bread than meat.  The soup was pretty much one would expect.  I liked most of the cold items: I had 3 oysters and the shrimp was a unique combo w/ seaweed.  My friend who does not eat seaweed liked the shrimp too. Neither my friend nor I liked the tartar.  I did not like the thick layer of cream cheese on top or digging out the fish. Comfort Bites This cart came along the same time as the Ribstickers.  For me, the brunch was moving along too quickly.  I would have asked for things to move more slowly but my friend was very happy with the pace so perhaps it was the right speed?   We both liked cheese burgers with lobster fries.  Kobe corn dogs, I thought the presentation was great, so fun and cute!  But we both thought that they tasted like plain hot dogs but liked them regardless.  Mac & Cheese with Ham Hocks, my friend thought this course was very good.  (I don't eat ham) I thought the presentation was adorable.  Mushroom risotto was one of my favorite dishes, you could really taste the truffle oil and I like it when something claims to have truffle oil and you can actually taste the truffle oil.  Southern Fried chicken drumstick was good.  Chinese BBQ spare rib - my friend liked it.   Ribstickers Polenta with braised short rib.  I love polenta so this dish was great for me.  I think short rib can be overwhelming so the small bite was the perfect amount of short rib.  My friend loved this dish too.  We both thought the Salmon was Salmon, nothing too special, it was light so that is good for people who are watching what they eat.  Beef sticks were my favorite dish.  I thought the sirloin was very tender and easy to eat.  It was served hot (off the rock) and very tasty.  Steak au Poivre, was good, creamed spinach was delicious.   Sweet Treats We tried everything, including the sundae. I particularly liked the caramel Dessert Shooter.  We both loved the doughnuts with the fortune, especially the (at Primehouse) part, we thought it was so funny.   Overall, the food was very good.  I think most of the items are very flavorful and delicious and other items were less flavorful.  I think that everyone would be pleased with the selection, there are SO MANY dishes that I cannot imagine anyone being left without something to eat.   Our bill came to about $100 ($35/person + coffee) inclusive of tax & tip and we both felt that it was worth it for all the food that we received.  Although we both agreed that this would not be what we would spend on a typical brunch, for a special brunch, or once in a while for a craving, we would be happy to splurge.",0.9998,0.708,0.268,0.024,0.5990264550264547

Although it is located in the schnazzy James Hotel, it was still quite casual despite the leather table cloths. So we order our seafood tower, my boyfriend got one of the aged steaks (you have to, you're at David Burke's). We also go the cesar salad, which is made table-side and opted for the Spanish white anchovies and the crab cake croutons (they could have used a little work). The salad was pretty good but for $22 I kind of expected more. The seafood platter was awesome and pretty much stuffed 3 people and we didn't even finish some of the pieces. The mussels on this tower were f-ing amazing and you get an assortment of sauces. The mignonette cold use some work--wonder if they've ever had an authentic one? It was rather bland, lacked the sweet pungency of shallots and pretty much tasted like red wine vinegar. But the other sauces were great! The steak was soooooooooo good. It was tasty juicy and moist. I would definitely go back. The desert was pretty good too, although at that point I was ready to explode. Unfortunately, I didn't care much for the service. The server that we had was never to be found and our glasses of water remained empty for pretty much the whole meal. We finally got a refill after we paid for our check.

2008-03-07,3.0,"There are alot of steakhouses in Chicago.  And this one, is just okay in my book. Located in the James Hotel, David Burke's Primehouse has a dark, masculine feeling from the moment you walk in -yet not in a clubby or lodge type way which might of helped.  It falls somewhere between contemporary and masculine which didn't work for me.  Neither did the Naugahyde table covers which just felt and looked weird.  It is also loud in the place- the sound echoing off the barren walls. We ordered three appetizers to share- the mussels, raw oysters and a salmon and tuna tartar.  The salmon and tuna tartar was the clear winner.  Very tasty and a lovely presentation.  The ginger mussels were a bit flavorless and many of the shells were empty, and the mix of east and west coast oysters?  Well, let's just say for that price, I was expecting more. For our entrees we went with the New York Sirloin and the Kansas City bone in sirloin which was dry aged 35 days.  Both pieces of meat were delicious and perfectly prepared.  The best part of the dinner.  But at $45 and $47 respectively for just the steak, I expected nothing short of perfection! The sides were merely okay and we tried three:  the creamed spinach (not good at all) the mac and cheese with porcini mushrooms (sounds great but wasn't creamy more like noodles and bread crumbs) and finally the fries with truffle oil and asiago- the best of the bunch!  Each of the sides ran $7 and you also pay to have sauces for your steak.  I chose Bearnaise and it was an additional $4.  Felt a little like I was being ""nickel and dimed"" to death.  Again, for that price- I felt that they could have thrown in the sauce. We had a couple of bottles of wine with dinner (an Etude Pinot Noir which was very good) and for dessert we split a selection of cheeses. All in all- I'd suggest it for a business dinner but it's not a place to go celebrate a special occasion or to spend time with a loved one.  It's just not that kind of a place.  If you go- go for the steak only.  As the rest of the selections and the price that you pay will leave you wondering why you came here in the first place.",0.981,0.836,0.117,0.047,0.55002286002286

We both started with the lobster bisque.  The bisque itself was just ok but there was definitely a good amount of lobster pieces in the bisque and I thought the spring roll was fantastic.  We also ordered the pretzel crabcakes off the regular menu and it was tasty.  The popovers were delicious.  They seem gigantic but you tear off a piece and realize it's an airy roll which is perfect for giving your stomach a teaser but not making yourselves beyond full. We got the Del Monaco and Petite Bone-in Fillet, both medium.  This is the part of the meal I became disappointed in.  And I'm sure it had to do moreso with the quantity of people they were serving that night ordering the same cuts.  The doneness of my steak varied from rare to well done and they were barely warm.  The mashed potatoes and tempura green beans that accompanied my fillet were just ok, nothing out this world, but still good. My favorite part of our meal had to be the dessert trio, especially the cheesecake lollipop, YUM! The ambiance is low-key trendy with just the right amount of lighting.  I like how the tables are spaced apart nicely so you don't feel like you're bumping into everyone. Overall, I definitely want to come back and give them a fair chance.  Service was above and beyond.  The manager came by after our meal and asked how we enjoyed ourselves.  She also offered to show us their aging room.  I definitely want to try their Cesar salad on my next visit!",0.9967,0.736,0.236,0.028,0.5808842083842084
2008-03-06,5.0,"I love me some fat and juicy steak, and the kind that they serve here at David Burke's Primehouse is no exception. I came here with a few of my friends for Thanksgiving dinner and was impressed with the exceptional food and service. Although I originally was drawn to the David Burke Thanksgiving pre fixe menu, I quickly changed my mind and opted to order a ""Kentucky"" Rib-Eye, instead. This bad boy was HUGE and the flavor of the meat was so wonderful and succulent. My mouth is watering now just writing this. As each of us scanned the menu, we all decided to scratch the Thanksgiving menu and order steaks and sides, instead. I was pleased with our unanimous decision. We had these delicious buttered corn biscuits to start with. AMAZING...For our sides we all shared the mushroom risotto and creamed spinach.  For dessert, we all decided to order something different so we could sample the various sweet treats that they offered. I ordered the cheesecake lolipops, mostly though for the dramatic effects. The lolipops were brought out with SPARKLERS. I thought it was FUNtastic! The icing on the cake for the evening was that our server gave us fresh take-home containers filled with turkey, mashed potatoes, pumpkin pie and the usual Thanksgiving spread to enjoy at home. I was very excited to have had the chance to try both their steaks and have a little piece of Thanksgiving delight to take home. Loved it.

2008-02-26,4.0,"Since I was in Chicago, I needed to try the one of the many steakhouses that this city offered. I noticed that David Burke was doing something for Restaurant Week and upon confirmation of what the menu was going to be, I had a reservation made. My steak-crazed buddy accompanied me and off we went to Primehouse.  We both chose the 3-course dinner menu but added an addtional appetizer. I had the crab cake because I was craving some crab and he had the kobe beef carpaccio. I kinda wished I had ordered that because it was slices of kobe beef on a block of salt. But my crab cake, though not containing jumbo lump crabmeat, still was tasty and full of crab. Though that kobe beef still looked mighty good.  For the appetizers on the Restaurant Week menu, I chose the lobster bisque and my buddy chose the seafood taster. He quickly inhaled both oysters and shrimp while I was still enjoying the smooth and richness of the bisque. Maximum lobster flavor with small chunks of lobster meat as well. We were both pleased with our selections. Him definitely more with the sustained enjoyment and glazed look of wonderment even after they had cleared the plate.  We both had the Baby Delmonico steak which was a nice cut of meat. The server said it was a ribeye cut which I thought would have more fat marbling and therefore a more tender and flavorful piece of meat than the other choice. Still great but expected it to be more tender and flavorful.  Perfect end to the meal was the chocolate milkshake, cheesecake lollipop, and the slice of chocolate cake. Classic David Burke desserts. I thought even with the extra appetizer this was a superb deal to be had. We both left full and he still with the glazed look of wonderment.",0.9924,0.826,0.147,0.027,0.5605072463768116

As for our entrees, I definitely preferred mine over the husband's.  I ordered the petite southside bone-in filet with basil-whipped potatoes and tempura green beans.  My filet was probably twice the size of his and really tasty.  You have to thank the bone for maintaining the flavor.  My husband had ordered the baby delmonico steak with truffle asiago skins, asparagus and shallots which was a little stringy, but the truffle asiago skins were yummy. After all that food washed down with glasses of Syrah, we had the dessert sampler plate which had a mini chocolate milkshake, a slice of their heavenly chocolate cake and a cheesecake lollipop - I had a chocolate covered raspberry one while the hubby had a chocolate covered vanilla one. Overall, a wonderful experience, delicious food, attentive service (we also arrived a little early - 5:30pm so I did see that we got better service than those arrived after us), and a wonderful deal for Restaurant Week!  On a side note, there is a specific garage that you can get your parking validated for so make sure that you read the signs.  We ended parking in the wrong garage and couldn't get parking validation.",0.9949,0.805,0.174,0.021,0.588510101010101

The food was amazing! To start, we had the kobe beef sashimi, tableside caesar, and the corn and sea scallop chowder.  The sashimi came on a beautiful block of pink himalayan salt with a to-die-for truffle mayo and the hot chowder was poured over slices of sea scallop, instantly cooking them to the perfect tenderness.  The caesar...ehhh.   Onto the meat, my boy had the 35 day aged KC sirloin and I had the 28 day aged rib-eye; both cooked to perfection and delicious.  He declared it the best steak he ever had and thoroughly enjoyed the rest of my rib-eye the next day.  Not sure if the taste was due to the grass-fed free range or to the aging, but it was outstanding.   We ended with coffee and the lollipop tree.  I was hesitant to order it since it seemed gimmicky, plus the boy is a chocolate FIEND.  But in the end, we just had to see what the thing was and we were not disappointed.  The cheesecake is creamy, covered in different kinds of chocolate with a seriously sinful raspberry mousse.  GET IT!  Great coffee too, btw.  A true treat for the steak lover, even I had a great time :)",0.9989,0.644,0.314,0.042,0.6968567251461989

The room is large and handsome, with fun artsy murals on the walls and leather coverings on the tables and chairs.  If you're going to kill the cow, use the whole thing, I guess.  Of course I had to check out the powder room, which was so elegant -- the stall doors went from floor to ceiling, and the sink was this cool, table-like trough. We were pretty much the only people in the place, which I guess is why they're running promotions like this.  The meal started with a warm, cheese-filled popover that came with sweet butter, but you really didn't need to use it.  Hubby ordered a ribeye sandwich and I got steak frites.  Both came with a pile of tasty fries, and mine added a huge honkin' onion ring for good measure.  Hubby's sandwich came  on a delicious artisan roll, and my meat was aged and cooked to near perfection.  We ordered the garlic spinach as a side, which was plenty to share but was perhaps a little heavily salted. The service was just impeccable.  No sneers for not ordering wine, no grimace for asking to take our extra frites home to the kids.  He even threw in a fresh popover for them.  Of course we tipped on what the meal would have actually cost -- just because you're a bargain hunter doesn't mean you have to be cheap, silly.

This is not your old school steakhouse, and I was pleasantly surprised about the ambiance.  It was refreshing to go to a steakhouse that was NOT a typical Chicago steakhouse, and they weren't all snotty either.  The hostess, waitress, and other staff were pleasantly fun and friendly.  When we were deciding on wine, we wanted to stay ""budget-friendly"" which is always tough to pull off without sounding cheap.  But the waitress and sommelier were very friendly and provided very good suggestions in our price range without making us feel like we were  people that drink wine out of a box. The other weird thing about this place was that there were so many attractive, young people.  Compared to Gibson's, Morton's, etc...where the clientele seems to be a bunch of fat guys like me stuffing their face with beef and finishing it off by drinking creamed spinach.  AND...there were lots of VERY skinny women there.  I mean I hope they were there eating a beautiful steak and enjoying it, but how do you maintain those figures?  I mean multiple women were runway model skinny...so they were either eating very little or throwing it up later.  I just kept on thinking if these girls were some guy's date and he was paying...what a dang waste!  Ordering a $40-$50 steak and only eating a quarter of it or puking it up later.  Now I may be completely wrong, and these girls could have housed a 40 ounce steak and then ran a marathon the next morning.  Good for them if they do...Sorry I digress.... I ordered the 40 Day Ribeye, and absolutely loved it.  Like everyone else says...too much fat...but that is where a lot of the flavor comes from.  Everyone else ordered the bone-in fillet which I DO NOT RECOMMEND!  If you want a bone-in fillet, go down a block to Joe's.  The bone-in fillet there is SO much better there.   This place lost a star due to the overall price.  I wouldn't go back here on my own dime.  I think we ended up paying $130/person or something like that.  Since it was about two months ago, the only memorable thing was my 40 day Ribeye and that the bone-in fillet is no good.  I know we had apps and dessert, but I don't recall if they were any good...which isn't a good sign.",0.9896,0.805,0.143,0.052,0.5522716049382717

The steaks were cooked as we requested them, but the spinach/chorizo side looked/tasted uninteresting and I was disappointed with the ""oscar"" presentation .. the crab was practically shredded (it looked like tuna out of a can), the asparagus overcooked.

Once you get past the whole every cut of beef comes from an offspring of bull 402L or whatever the case is, this is a truly great steakhouse with the largest selection of bone-in cuts of beef.  The sides are imaginative and different from the standard steakhouse fare and the appetizers almost outperform the entrees.  However, don't come here unless you can stand the prices.  Between the wine list and the food, you can easily spend over $100 per person.  However, if you take it easy on the appetizers and stick to wines by the glass, you might get out for around $65.

We asked for a wine recommendation and he had started describing the two red wines we were considering as white wines. No problem, I felt it was an honest mistake. But after that, things got weird. He was very quick when he came to our table and started ignoring us. I don't think we were being loud or rude, so not sure what the problem was. He disappeared when we finished our dinner; we were going to order dessert and after dinner drinks, but ended up going elsewhere, because he never came around again.  Like I said, my first experience was fantastic; great all around and I would have given this place a five star review based on that experience.

2007-07-19,4.0,"This is kind of a hard one to write. Some things at Primehouse were absolutely fantastic, others just good. First off, the place is very down to earth. It's the most expensive restaurant I've ever been where the hostess is NOT a model who treats me with utter disdain, the sommelier was not pressuring us and making us feel like idiots, and our server had a great attitude as well. The aesthetics are very understated - textured beige walls, low lighting, with techno/alt playing in the background. The tables have leather table clothes and the china is simple white with nice heavy utensils. Now on to the food... We ordered the crabcakes (awesome) and the dumplings (not so awesome.) Had the caeser salad which was pretty good and the popover was good but not the heaven on earth experience i was expecting reading other reviews here.  Several of us ordered the 65 day aged ribeye. The seasonings were excellent and the termperature of the meat was good but there was a surprising amount of fat on my cut. I know I know, ribeyes have ""marbling"" but I would say 30% of my cut was fat. I didn't say anything which perhaps I should have for a $65 piece of meat, but whatever. It still tasted very good and I don't need to be a fat ass and eat a 20 oz cut anyway.  Finally for desert we had the 10 layer chocolate number and the lollipop thing. Frankly after a huge meal the desserts are almost too rich so lighter eaters may want to just skip dessert and get a glass of wine to finish off the meal instead. All in all I had a good experience at Primehouse as did my dinner-mates but I think the food was a little too uneven to warramt 5 stars. Basically if it's your birthday or you're celebrating something special or your company is footing the bill, you can't really miss at this place but if it's more a romantic date type thing you're looking for and you aren't huge carnivores there are probably some other places you'd get better ambiance and lighter fare.",0.9926,0.765,0.179,0.056,0.6002173091458806

Get the most aged, largest steak you can afford (aged in their Himalayan salt room - tell me that's not cool). And do not skimp on the sides - I love both the tempura green beans and the old-style hash browns.

2007-01-25,3.0,"Primehouse is a little inconsistent, but can be excellent when firing on all cylinders. Their bone-in Kentucky style Ribeye is usually excellent with hearty, rich beef, usually (though not always) cooked to perfection and minimally seasoned to bring out the natural flavors of the high-quality beef. The NY Strip and Filet are pretty good, too, if you're looking for a litle bit less decadence than the ribeye. The bread and sides are different from what you'd see in the typical steakhouse, but in a lot of cases seem like they're different just for the sake of being different, and the flavors don't match those of well-executed more conventional fare. Dessert is a different story, though, as the Slice of Prime, Doughnuts, and Cheesecake Lollipops provide some of the best after-dinner experiences in the city (and make a stop in the bar for dessert after dinner at another venue a great option, too.)  The service is not quite up to par for what you would expect at a hotel-owned emporium, and can often times be uninformed and clumsy, they also do not rectify occasional mistakes well, tending to put the onus on the customer such as one time where a ribeye ordered medium was brought out very well done, then replaced by one that was very, very rare and had to be sent back again. I've also had a few snafus with reservations, having wrong dishes been brought out, and servers who didn't have any training about the wine list.  The wine list is pretty good, and doesn't gouge as much as many hotel restaurants. It contains some smaller production selections that are very good, but with hit-or-miss availability (understandably so.) They also have a nice selection of dessert wines by the glass that includes Moscati D'Asti, Sauternes, and Tokaji Aszu. Interestingly, the Tokaji (a lovely, relatively rare botryized wine from Hungary) is the cheapest of the three at 8 dollars per glass and isn't even labeled as a Tokaji on the main list but is highly recommended.   All in all, Primehouse is very good, but still needs some more polish if it wants to be in the same league as Joe's, Gibson's, Morton's, or the Saloon.",0.9977,0.776,0.2,0.024,0.54421768707483
