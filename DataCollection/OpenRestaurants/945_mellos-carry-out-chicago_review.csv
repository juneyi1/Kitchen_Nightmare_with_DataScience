The meat tasted different and it was constructed sloppily, with lettuce chunks instead of a lettuce leaf which caused my bun to fall apart and condiments on my hands.

He counters with ""There is already ketchup at the bottom of the bag, do you want more?"". This bothered me because it was already determined that I wanted ketchup because I had asked for it. Furthermore, when I got home, I had learned there was 1 ketchup packet in the bag, prior to him throwing 3 into my bag. They seemed to have been cheap about the ketchup packets.

2016-09-29,5.0,"Ok, so I'm writing this because I was compelled to after having such an amazing lunch! I had the Gyro Sandwich, fries, and a soda. 1) Gyro - in my opinion a good Gyro in Chicago isn't hard to find. However, a great one is! The Gyro at Mello's really is Great!  A. The meat is succulent and tasty and while it's juicy, is not at all greasy! Just delicious! (None of those little hard piece in the meat, no bread fillers, just high quality meat! B. The Tzatziki sauce  was perfect. It didn't taste like it was from a jug, but I also don't know for sure if they make it there. Either way it was yummy, no too thick, and far from watery. C. The bread was definitely my favorite part! (Well it tied the meat) the bread was super soft and just perfectly chewy! It was grilled just right and I really loved it! D. Tomatoes and onions: they were fresh and delicious.  2) Fries - ok, fresh cut French Fries are so hard to pull off. Almost every time I have fresh cut fries from somewhere they are either burnt tasting or sloppy greasy. These were just perfection! They had amazing flavor, not at all overly greasy, and salted to perfection! The flavor made it clear they oil was fresh and I would have been happy ordering just a plate of these!! And one (ok two) other thought(s) --- First, I have read some of the reviews in Yelp talking about beggars and stuff and all I can say I I've personally been in here 12-15 times and haven't seen anyone asking for money. Second, several people have made comments about the bathroom being for paying customers only and saying it's illegal or just whining...woah, have you even been to places around Lincoln Park? There are SO MANY that have signs that read ""Bathrooms for customers only"" and such and the restaurant does that to reduce issues with homeless loitering and other negative behaviors associated with people who use the bathroom that aren't customers. I mean seriously you whining brats, you complain about beggars,m and say the restaurant needs to do something about it, and yet the single biggest deterrent used by many others in the area you cry about. I'm really amazed by people. Oh and the review about how the guy and his friends were assaulted and not given napkins to clean off or allowed to wait inside made me laugh. I may be wrong, but what I read was: ""yea, we were wasted and acting like jackasses!

2016-04-10,1.0,"Where to I even begin? Let me say that it all ended in filing a POLICE REPORT.  Now let me back track.... Walked in here with my boyfriend and other male friend yesterday, 4/9/16.  As the guys were checking out the menu just looking for a quick snack or drink I asked the older of the 3 employees working if I could use the restroom.  He immediately whipped back, ""are you going to buy something?!"".  I pointed at the two guys I was with and said they're looking at the menu right now, can you please open the bathroom.  This alone is illegal in the city of Chicago but that's really beside the point after what went down after. After I used their DISGUSTING restroom the employee was so quick to deny me access to, I'm standing around waiting with my boyfriend and my other friend.  There are two other males in the restaurant (if you could even consider this place a restaurant but I digress...) one of which had just received his food and the other was sitting in PJ pants looking a bit disheveled but I didn't think anything of it, I just assumed this man was waiting for his food.   All of the sudden the man in PJ pants screeches his chair, lunging out of it and starts to PUMMEL my friend PUNCHING him over and over agin and continuing after he was knocked onto the floor.  Everyone was in complete and utter shock and I just started screaming at the top of my lungs until the assailant jumped off of him.  The employees did NOTHING to help and I was the one confronting the attacker asking over and over again, ""Why did you punch my friend? What is wrong with you?"" etc.  The man in PJ pants starts to walk away and while my boyfriend was attending to my friend on the floor, covered in a milkshake and bruises, I follow the man in PJ pants for a couple blocks while on the phone with 911 and was advised to cease following the perpetrator when he ran out of site and return to meet the police.   I walked back into Mello's and told my boyfriend and my friend that the police were on their way and that they should be there soon.  At that moment, the older employee who tried to deny me access to the bathroom, said something to the effect of that we needed to meet the police OUTSIDE.  I snapped back and scolded him for his insensitivity.  My friend was still covered in milkshake, covered in bruises and the employees offered him NOTHING.  Not even some ice for his eye or paper towels to clean up.  On top of all that, my friend was not compensated for the food he paid for and never received.  It should also be pointed out that none of the employees called 911 when they had the chance and the time they wasted gawking at the situation could have been the difference in getting this lunatic picked up off the streets. The police arrive and we write up a report all the while the lunatic who attacked my friend COMPLETELY UNPROVOKED is walking around Lincoln Park.  What gets me about these Mello's employees is that they were so quick to deny me access to the restroom without paying for something yet, they let this LUNATIC sit there WITHOUT BUYING ANYTHING.  Then, they have the audacity to ask US TO LEAVE AND WAIT FOR THE POLICE OUTSIDE.  Kind of makes you wonder what, if anything, they're hiding if they're so reluctant to allow the police to do their job.   Fortunately my friend only had a mild concussion and will be okay. Big thanks to the officer for driving us to the hospital and not making us deal with an ambulance.

Smaller dogs, increased price, worse tzatziki, cheaper and greasier gyros on the spit, forget the rib eye or ribs.  I'll say that the guy is practically absentee and there has been a high turnover ever since Mellos.  The guy didn't even know the register.  Yesterday he was there and had to ask the guys if they had frozen fries.  He only changed to the ""healthy fresh cut"" dripping and soggy with oil so the guys would have to cut them and save  him $$.  Now they DO have frozen also.  Everything has turned to frozen and really unnecessary since they do a good business.  But this way they can do without three guys working full shifts.  I have had pork souvlaki that had the end pieces tasting funky and spoiled.  There doesn't seem to be any accounting on how long the meats had been unfrozen before they made kebabs to freeze.  I've had the same funk with the chicken kebabs, but the breasts aren't supposed to be frozen they say.  That explains why there are no onions or tomatoes on the skewer.  Those don't freeze well.   But brushing all these with oil and spice might fool you.  You watch next time.  They put absolutely everything on the fry grill to thaw with a pot lid over.  Then the meats go to the coals.  They never char because they're wet.  Burgers same thing  and so different tasting since Mellos left.  Awful, in fact.  Yesterday the dog went on the fry grill first and I asked why since they're supposed to be steamed, right?  It explains why I had a cold dog last month.  Lastly, yesterday, while I was watching my dog on the fry grill (and not over the coals ever), I watched while the guy shaved off gyros meat and not for a fresh sandwich.  He was filling a clear plastic pitcher with shaved meat.  That explains why I saw gyros meat on the fry grill this summer.  I gave up on the Italian beef before summer.  Tough and ugly and, no, it is not homemade.  No reason for this nonsense.  Now I know why the Italian beef had a long wait, as well as everyone for anything.  These items were good with Mellos.

After trying gyros at two other places -- one of them a particularly well-reviewed Greek restaurant -- I was halting my search for a delicious, fast, reasonably-priced, fuss-less neighborhood gyro.   Someday, I may branch out a little.
