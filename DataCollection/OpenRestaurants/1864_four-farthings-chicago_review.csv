The food and beer prices aren't great or anything, kind of the regular amount you'd see at any other juiced-up-bro bars in the area. But the karaoke makes it all worth it. Fantastic atmosphere and an all around fun time when Luis is leading the fun.  This place deserves five stars. The only reason I'm giving it four is due to the bar staff. I closed out my tab and paid the bill without seeing the receipt, just the total. I opted for an emailed receipt and the next day looked at it to find two extra drinks listed that I didn't order. Shame on me for not asking to see an itemized list when I closed out, but also it's a little frustrating to get someone else's drinks on your tab. A little more attention needs to be paid by the bar staff.",0.5747,0.881,0.084,0.035,0.47849650349650347

Special shout out to bar tenders Nicole and Audrey - You guys make us eager to go back because of the wonderful energy we experience there. This bar is not like any other, especially in Lincoln Park.

Last week tried their new concept which is adding high end drinks and some food options. They were offering a Zoo Lights coupon/discount. On this occasion, we had an attentive server, but she seemed to be on her own for the first hour so she was run ragged- both kitchen and bar duty? Flatbread could have been good, but not grilled thoroughly - doughy taste. Probably cooked in a toaster oven. The charcuterie platter was well presented and fine but expensive.

They have since removed all of the old charm that reminded the locals of how deeply rooted this bar was into the Lincoln Park community. The new ownership took out all of the old hardwood furniture and replaced it with IKEA trash. And it looks terrible and cheap. They hired new staff that honest to god must have ZERO bar tending experience; they are beyond terrible. They use some garbage iPads for credit card processing now. This adds an exorbitant amount of time to the transaction -- especially when they are busy.  They removed all of the speed rails and now just store the bottles of booze and dirty bar mats wherever they see fit. This takes up/wastes much of the bar space.  They allow their bounders in the back (might be bar backs) to eat Domino's pizza delivery on the floor.  They have closed down the kitchen.... They turned the men's and women's restrooms into single person rooms. THIS IS SO STUPID FOR A BAR.  All in all, this bar is clearly under TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT. The people who took over must have NO EXPERIENCE whatsoever. Unfortunately, I expect this bar to be belly up within 6 months. I have heard from many long-term patrons that the changes have been too vast and simply unwarranted. People in the community do not feel connected this this bar anymore....

Went for a lunch on a Friday afternoon around 2pm so in theory it shouldn't have been peak time. Sat outside which was really nice and there are some nice shade trees to cover you if it's a sunny day. Service got off to a good start with a member of the waitstaff bringing a carafe of water, some breadsticks and butter and silverware. But then that was it for quite some time. We quickly figured out there was only one waitress for the entire patio and quite possibly the entire place.  After finally placing our drink order, we again waited. And waited. And waited. Like 15 minutes for our beers. Not sure if they were growing the hops and making it themselves but that seemed a bit excessive.  When she finally came back, we got to place our order.

I have never been asked this in my life- usually they just give me the fish however it should be cooked. I asked for whatever the usual way was. Nope, I had to pick. Okay, uh medium? And it was a bit dry. I guess now I know to order it medium-rare, just like I like my steak, if I'm ever asked again.  The meal and service was fine, I can't complain much and my friend seemed to enjoy her entree as well, but it wasn't anything memorable or even all that interesting and I unfortunately won't be finding myself here again.

Im not sure who the bar supported before, but it was so memorable that I cant even recall the team(s). Second..the staff! Nice to see fresh, excited faces working here....no more of the 'I've been here for blah, blah many years, so you have to put up with me being inept"". What did not change was the food. Definitely upscale bar food!!! I had the lamb shank in a rosemary sauce, that will make me think twice about going to Greek Town in the future!!! Huge, flavorful, fresh and amazing!!! I was by myself, so I sat at the bar and had just a great time b.s.-ing with the bartender and staff. It was a real treat to deal with a staff that treated everything I wanted like it was not only important, but no problem at all! There are other restaurants in that area that can feel like you are eating in a funeral home and treat you as if you are sub-human. In fact, i had such a great time that I stayed for Karaoke and watched the bar fill up with great looking, really friendly people that actually can sing! And for Luis....the guy that runs the karaoke....he does Whitney better than Whitney! All in all an amazing place with dual-personalities (quaint dining room on one side, fun bar on the other), that has upgraded the staff, has not lost its flair for fun, and has really great food!

2014-05-11,3.0,"Came here for a beer yesterday with my buddy and kept him company while he ate lunch (it was his first time at Four Farthings).  I suggested the place because any time I've been in here I've had a pretty good time.   Granted, before yesterday, any of the maybe 5 times I've been in here was for a beer on my way home.  During those experiences, the bartenders have always friendly, the environment is perfect for what I'm looking for, and I like their simple-but-cover-all beer selection.  They don't have a ton to choose from, but I feel like they always have what you're looking for which is good enough for me. Anyway, back to yesterday, my first time dining in, we sat on the patio and it took a long time for our server to greet us.  We didn't totally mind since it's finally f*cking nice out, but I was right at the point where I was going to get up and ask if we had someone taking care of us when she finally showed up.  She did briefly apologize for the wait and took our orders.  We never saw her again until the food came (save for when she hurriedly dropped off our drinks).  I tried my buddy's pulled pork sandwich and it was pretty standard.  I liked it, but I don't know that I would order one for myself.  Good fries though.  Again, basic, but well done. My beer glass had been empty for a while when the server came back to see if I wanted another one.  I told her I was thinking about it, but I needed a minute to decide what I wanted.  I was totally ready to order another beer, but she never came back to take my order.  The slow service dwindled our desire to enjoy another round or two on their quaint little patio (that I truly do enjoy), so we decided that if our server ever showed up again we would take the check. My buddy and I are both in the industry, so we understand that people can get busy which can result in slow service.  We get it.  Things happen.  So I went inside to see if maybe the place was slammed or something, but there were a mere three people drinking at the bar.  I poked my head into the dining room and it was nearly empty (we were in the post-lunch rush/pre-dinner rush slot). In other words, she either just kept forgetting about us or was super busy with something not related to taking care of people in the restaurant. I would probably give FF another shot at a dine-in experience (thanks to some positive reviews from other Yelpers - they're showing me this place isn't always like what I dealt with), but I'm certainly in no rush to get back there.",0.9976,0.817,0.168,0.014,0.47248247783962083

I made a reservation just in case, since it was Friday. Upon walking in to meet my friend, we were a little confused. It felt like we were walking into a slightly upscale dive bar (which, mind you, I love, but this was not what I was expecting). We asked the super helpful staff where to go and where led through two double doors into a dining room, where the loud music was replaced with white table cloths. It was kind of a jarring contrast, but kind of cool at the same time. We were seated right away, and probably didn't need a reservation. The server was amazing, and explained the menu perfectly. What really impressed me was the wine list. There is a reason this place comes up when you Google wine bars. Most wines were reasonably priced too-there were many in the $31 and below range. Our server recommended a great Pinot Grigio. For dinner I got the skate wing, which  I've never had anywhere else. It was served with a mustard sauce and was amazing. My friend got the mahi mahi and loved it too. The sides that came with it were just okay-steamed vegetables without much flavor (I dipped them in sauce) and garlic mashed potatoes that had a gravy that I didn't love.

Honestly, I would've rather had him tell me they didn't have coffee at all than experience his condescending attitude about it.  Anyways, I ordered a ham and cheese omelette.

Well excuse me sir I didn't realize I didn't do YOUR job to your specifications.  Maybe if I worked there I would of gotten right.

My complaints were relatively minor, but in the spirit of full disclosure...In winter, the bar is the only restaurant entrance and the dining room is not well marked. We wandered in awkwardly and finally had to ask a bartender where the restaurant entrance was (through double swinging doors opening to a partially open kitchen on the right). Our server was absolutely nice enough but did seem to struggle to keep up (she told us later it was her first time working brunch). We noticed she brought another table the wrong order, we waited about 15 minutes between seeing menus and being asked to place our order, and were often waiting for refills on water (the 4 oz water glasses seriously need to go) and coffee. All in all, if you have the right expectations (not in a huge hurry, not looking for brunch reinvented) I can't see being displeased with Four Farthings.

2012-01-09,2.0,"EDIT #2: Last visit to establishment for brunch on 1/8/12 OK to good food for brunch or dinner (have not been here for lunch) with arguably one of the best outdoor patios in Lincoln Park/Old Town in the spring-fall that is absolutely ruined by poor service, as mentioned several times in the reviews here on Yelp. (EDIT: Most recently 5/16/11, 6/7/11, 8/1/11, and 11/5/11) This is a place that is rare in that you nearly forget how bad the service was the last time you were here (if you go here once every six weeks or so) as the food almost compensates for your frustrations that will slowly build up as your meal takes place.  A few things to keep in mind as you consider coming to this place: 1. You will be thirsty. You will be served water (eventually) in a small rocks-sized glass that will be refilled (if you are lucky) once when your food arrives, and on a good day, one more time if you flag down the waiter/waitress to refill your glass. 2. You will encounter frustrating inattentiveness. You will encounter many servers walking around and/or eating at the bar if you are sitting inside no matter how busy  the establishment is. (If you are seated outside, expect to see your server twice, maybe three times while you are there for a 1-1.5 hour brunch). 3. You will wait. And wait. And wait some more. 4. You will wonder if your server suffered some sort of horrific accident while watching ESPN in the bar area as their prolonged absence will give you cause for concern. 5. You will consider leaving and going someplace else, decide to go somewhere else, then begin to stand up and leave just as your absentee server comes out with either your coffee, first round of drinks, or main course. 6. You will swear upon leaving this place that you will not go back again no matter how decent the food was. 7. You will laugh at the 'People love us on Yelp!' sticker on the door as you leave. 8. You will return six weeks later, and try to reassure yourself that the service ""could not possibly be as bad as last time."" 9. You will be wrong.

2011-08-01,2.0,"We were seated immediately and courteously by a hostess who ensured that we were brought tiny glasses of water on a baking hot July afternoon.  Our server arrived a few minutes later, but before we were quite ready for anything but drinks. This was already a promising start, but it proved to be a false one. After a leisurely perusal of the menu and an extraordinarily difficult time deciding between options, we made our choices and were surprised the server hadn't come back to check on us. We were equally surprised five minutes later when the beer finally arrived, our order was finally taken, our water was not refilled, and my sweetheart was not brought a larger glass despite not ordering another drink. Perhaps this was an oversight and our waiter was busy inside. Perhaps not. The seafood chowder was completely acceptable, but not what I'd call tasty or flavorful. Perhaps inoffensive? The hot jerk wings were really neither, and while the flavor was still pretty good, the wings themselves were rather dry and tough to chew. My girlfriend got the artichoke and hearts of palm salad, which was almost inoffensive as well. The taste was fine, but not great, and the whole salad was sitting in a huge puddle of water: I assume this means the artichokes and the hearts of palm came straight from the can and there was no attempt to drain them. That was certainly their taste. And then there's the absentee waiter. This man was nowhere to be found for the entire meal, seemingly refused to refill our tiny waters (though he succeeded once after bringing out food), and hadn't any clue we might be finished with our meal. After a ten minute wait for the check, I went inside, asked for the bill, and observed our erstwhile server talking with the cooks. I asked the gentleman helping me if he was just chatting the entire time, and was advised that he had to make the evening menu. All well and good, but not for us.

Walking in at about 9:30pm the place was quiet with tables readily available, I admittedly felt right at home as it reminded me of the typical nicer Wisconsin corner bars that adorn every street turn of my agriculturally-astute homeland.  I said, remind-ED me (throat clearing) until in walked Lady Gaga himself.   I have never had such a great time watching and listening to a karaoke DJ (what are they called anyways?).  This DJ left me so impressed I even caught the name of the karaoke business, Standing Ovations karaoke!  As Lady Gaga was performing, on the bar, on the stools, and perched on a ledge I caught a few passers-by peering in through the windows to see what was going on in the now, fully-packed, vibrant, ladies dancing everywhere, people-clapping, awe-inspiring bar.  As Lady Gaga walked out the front door to sing to people outside, drawing in even more of a crowd to the tunes of Madonna, I thought to myself, the owner of Four Farthings knew exactly what they were doing when they hired THIS karaoke company.   Don't be disillusioned by the perceptibly ""calm"" crowd on a Saturday evening pre-karaoke, it's merely the calm before the storm, so be prepared to ""Vogue"" into the wee hours of the night, and if your name is ""Alejandro"", prepare yourself for your very own special performance.",0.9772,0.881,0.108,0.011,0.4761904761904761
2010-06-26,4.0,"I have no clue why at every work trip I attend, we somehow end up at a divey karaoke bar. In Denver, the one we patronized featured a homeless man who asked one of my lovely coworkers to slow dance - he must have known that it was her first day on the job. And by the way, their dance was lovely. In Long Beach, I ended up in a breathless duet with a coworker singing Violent Femmes. In San Francisco, a typically mild-mannered male coworker worked the dance floor with a Britney Spears hit. And this time, it was at Four Farthings, led there by a coworker who used to bartend there, and this may have been the most memorable work karaoke experience yet.  The moment we walked in, I could feel my hip coworkers' hearts breaking a little.  The crowd skewed very young, many looking like they were still in college, and almost everyone in the room seemed to be blacked out. We headed to a back room and grabbed a table in the ""Free Party Room."" There was a popcorn machine in the back corner that made some of us very excited, but sadly there was no receptacle for the popcorn, so we were reduced to staring at it longingly.  Soon our waitress came and from her first glare, we knew she hated us. Why? Because we were sitting in the Free Party Room? Because we wanted to pay her money to bring us drinks, as her job requires? Who knows? But I do know that the corners of her mouth were permanently pointed towards the floor and every time we asked a question I was afraid she was about to throw a punch.  I will say the exact opposite about Shannon, the bartender. Grinning ear to ear, endlessly cheerful, funny and cool, we absolutely loved this woman. Give her a raise!  Now on to the good stuff. After a while we decided it was pointless to be here and not sing a bit. The karaoke ""stage"" is really a patch of floor right by the main entrance, one huge speaker pointed right in your ear. The KJ here is no ordinary KJ - he's an outrageously good singer who sounds just like Gaga, Madonna, Leona Lewis... basically every diva combined into one sassy package. Between other people's songs, he'd put on a show of his own, dancing on the bar, humping drunk patrons and generally being a fantastic performer. I think he made a deal with the bar where he could have a nightly show of his own as long as they called it 'karaoke' and he allowed random other suckers to try their luck in between his numbers.  One of those suckers was me, going up there like a fool with my two coworkers to sing the theme song to The Fresh Prince of Bel Air only to find that there are two extra verses to the song that were never featured in the show! How embarrassing. To make things worse, we were sandwiched by two of the KJs best performances of the night. We decided the only solution was to dance the night away, and that we did. The fact that Four Farthings made a bunch of working 20 somethings dance like maniacs after a tiring day of work at a bar they'd never visit normally is really saying something and may make up for the mean service we received in the Free Party Room.  Say what you will about Four Farthings, but I walked out of there with some great memories, met some very interesting characters and worked up a sweat. So all in all, I'd call it a success.",0.996,0.771,0.156,0.072,0.5900654761904762

And that's about all I remember from my experience at Four Farthings :) I kid, I kid... sort of. It was the last stop of the night for my posse and we had already had a few. But the staff here seems pretty equipped to deal with the drunkards and I'm pretty sure we were the least offensive people at the bar that night. I seem to recall a gal who was so drunk she was cross-eyed, who was stealing drinks off of the bar. So compared to her, we were A-OK! Eventually someone from behind the bar called her a cab, so an extra star goes to the staff for making sure she got home safely. But back to the karaoke. It's your standard KJ working the room, the kind who sings two songs of his choice (with a few friends constantly cheering him on) before letting someone else take a turn. My fave of the night had to be Danny W's rousing rendition of  ""I Want It That Way"" by the Backstreet Boys. Obviously Danny W has a solid Plan B in effect in case this CM gig doesn't pan out :) Is this the kind of bar where I'd hang out on a regular basis if I lived here? Probably not.

2007-07-17,4.0,"this place is great if you want to pick up a divorced cougar.  everyone is very friendly, it is well lit and usually not too crowded.  they are nice enough to offer a beer of the month so if you are drinking in volume you don't have to drop a mint  (however, if the beer of the month is schlitz, pay up for bud...schlitz tastes ok but the hangover is dreadful).    The food is solid and the restaurant is pretty nice.  I only wish they hadnt taken away the pool table several years ago.",0.9641,0.747,0.242,0.011,0.6458333333333334
2007-04-29,3.0,"I like this place.  It's a good place to go for a casual dinner during the week and it lways seems to be fairly fresh.  The portions are very good and you always get a nice side of vegies (mom would be pleased).  Don't like to walk thru the bar with my child, but it only takes a few moments.  Good salads and great hamburgers.",0.9575,0.7,0.3,0.0,0.7196666666666667
2006-07-23,5.0,"I've eaten at Four Farthings perhaps a dozen times over the years, and the food/service has been great every time. I've only been in the bar a few times, but each time it was lively and not horribly crowded. They even showed the 2006 Stanley Cup finals -- one of the few bars in the city (country?) to do so. Bravo! We ate appetizers in the bar the last time we were there and the food was very, very good. Not what you'd expect for bar food. Can't wait to get back!",0.9465,0.849,0.151,0.0,0.47740740740740745
2006-07-09,5.0,I love this bar.  It's a wonderful local hotspot.  The food and drinks are reasonably priced.  The staff is extremely friendly and great to hang out with.  The regular customers are also fun to see and talk to.  During the week it's not very busy which is nice if you just want a low-key evening.  Thursday however is Karaoke night and it's the greatest party.  Stop in whenever and tell them Niall sent you!,0.982,0.652,0.324,0.024,0.5416083916083917
2006-04-17,4.0,"I had my birthday party there, and it was great. The party room is FREE and you and your guests can pay by the drink, so the host isn't responsible  for the money (especially great if you are throwing a party for yourself). They will also let you ""decorate"" the room for your event. The space will accommodate around 40 people. It was perfect for my occasion.",0.9708,0.672,0.288,0.04,0.82
2005-12-05,2.0,I went here on a Saturday night and it was packed to the max.  I also had a beer called Sierra Nevada...gross! Wouldn't be a bad bar to go back to on a weeknight.,0.484,0.896,0.104,0.0,0.3333333333333333
