2017-05-01,2.0,"I gave the restaurant 2 stars because of the ambiance and the service; both were pleasant. The food, however, was not good at all. I got the scallops and ended up not even eating them all, and there were only 4 of them in the full sized meal portion ($36). They were bland, flavorless, lying on a listless bed of starchy peas, and the worst part - they were incredibly SANDY. This is admittedly a pet peeve of mine, but if I'm paying these kind of prices I feel I should not be biting into sand with every single mouthful. I gave my husband half of a scallop to try, and he too complained about the gritty sand. It's like they didn't wash them at all. The sauces - bland. The pasta - meh. Serving sizes - small. Prices - very high. The cheapest glass of wine (not a fancy brand) was $12. My husband actually liked the creamy tomato sauce that came with my son's child meal better than he liked the sauce on his spicy sausage ravioli. My other son got a kid's meal that was basically bowties in butter - even a 9 year-old recognized that it was maybe a dollar's worth of food for a much heftier price tag than it was worth. It's also not ""right across the street"" from the Hamilton theater, btw. After the meal we were very confused on the sidewalk until a helpful local pointed us in the right direction.

It was at the start of dinner on a weekday and wasn't super crowded, but I still felt as though we were being rushed, and the server wasn't particularly attentive.  The food is delicious, though.

2017-04-20,5.0,"Come off the street, go down the steps and descend into a warm, cozy, yet trendy fantastic environment for an amazing Italian dinner.  I've read a lot of reviewers who chose this as a pre-theater spot, but we had no theater tickets (have you seen those Hamilton prices? lol) and saw this place listed as #1 in Chicago on some sites so we had to check it out. We started off with some cocktails as we perused the menu (wait, you don't do that? Ohhh..you really must order a crafted cocktail while you decide what you will be eating...then you can switch to wine...stick with me here...)  We indulged in The City That Never Sleeps (Bulleit Bourbon, St. George NOLA, Cocchi Americano, Agnostura Bitters) and Barrel Aged Negroni (Few Barrel Aged Gin, Campari, Sweet Vermouth) - both were perfectly crafted and tasted amazing. We figured we'd need an appetizer so we could slow down the main course from coming out (isn't that what appetizers are for? put the breaks on the meal so you can order more drinks?)  We chose the Caesar Salad (I know, I know..but it had KALE) and Burrata Salad (smoked burrata...with pears, mushrooms, spinach, frisee, other stuff) - both were super tasty and did the perfect job of allowing us to transition into the wine course aka dinner. We went with Cannoneau and Valdisanti.  Look...I'm going off of the receipt here...all I can tell you is they were fantastic glasses of wine that went really well with our meals!! Our entrees....Fresh Herb Pappardelle (wild mushrooms, leeks, garlic, thyme, white wine, gorgonzola) and Lobster Fra Diavolo (Maine lobster, black pepper fettucine, cherry tomatoes, Calabrian chili, gremolata).  They were both AMAZING!  The pasta was so freshly made.  The pappardelle had such an amazing flavor to it, you just cannot beat homemade pasta and mushrooms.  The Fra Diavolo had the absolute perfect spice - proper amount of lobster and such a great balance of the cherry tomatoes against the chili.  Both entrees were absolutely fantastic! We both knew we wanted some 20 year tawny port for dessert (Otimo) and decided to split the Torta Di Cioccolato (flourless chocolate cake, blood orange anglaise,pistachio gelato, blood orange chip, pistachio praline).  It was fantastic!  I'm not a big chocolate person and it was the perfect blend of light chocolate mixed with pistachio and orange flavors.  Absolutely delightful. So our meal was just amazing and perfect.  We could not have asked for anything more.  But let me add that the service was some of the best we've had.  Tammy was the perfect blend of attentive yet gave us our space.  We never felt rushed, we felt taken care of, she had great suggestions and provided such a fun and enjoyable evening.  Tammy was exactly what you want in a server and I will definitely ask for her when we hopefully make a return visit in the near future. I sound like a fan boy, but I really have no 'Cons' to this restaurant or the experience.  Stop reading this and go ahead and book it...you will not be disappointed.",0.9993,0.757,0.23,0.014,0.5726851851851852

Okay, now on to the food. When you get there, they bring you warm bread with a delicious cheese spread. We started with the prawns, which were tender, buttery and perfectly cooked. David brought us a sample of the butternut squash ravioli. Neither my husband or I are fans of butternut squash, but the ravioli were savory and delicious! We both ordered the sausage ravioli - take the advice of other reviewers and get the ravioli! It was amazing.

We were greeted with warm lighting, a comforting but not pretentious Italian atmosphere and perhaps the friendliest and most chipper waiter I've ever had in my life. I opted for the field green salad with goat cheese and the potato gnocchi (made in house). Both great, but the gnocchi was quite rich and only an appetizer size dish.  Do not leave without ordering the tiramisu - some of the best I've had AND it comes with a chocolate covered strawberry! Perfect for splitting. On my way out, I couldn't help but notice how busy it was (make a reservation!) and how many kids I saw (not sure if there's a kids' menu or if these kids have sophisticated palettes).

Other than the spicy sausage orecchiette, everything was pretty average, nothing to write home about. My husband felt he had better butternut ravioli at Tavern on the Park. The profiteroles were also disappointing; Gelato was good but the puff was hardly edible because it was so hard.  What really got me was I told them we were there to celebrate my birthday. I told them I signed up for the $40 birthday certificate a few days after my birthday so I hadn't received the certificate yet. And I didn't expect to, since I signed up later. But I was hoping that they'd comp a dessert or do something. Nope. Nada. Not even a happy birthday. Disappointed.",0.9144,0.779,0.152,0.069,0.48382352941176476

Service for Events: Needs improvement.  So for the rehearsal dinner when it really matters that everything finish on time before guests start arriving for our post -rehearsal dinner event with all wedding guests, we had the dessert being served at the time the event was supposed to be ending.  We had communicated that it was important for everything to be wrapped up on time and still that was not the case.  Other than this event, I have not had any issues with timing.  I think if you are not in a rush, you will not have any issues.  Honestly I would have given 5 stars if not for this issue. Ambiance: excellent; it reminds me of a lot of restaurants in Tuscany. Let's get to the food: Excellent (see dish details below) The red pepper cream cheese dip served with the bread: Excellent.  I never eat bread but I will eat the bread here so that I can eat the dip.  That's how good it is. Crab ravioli with curry oil/quinoa - hands down my favorite dish for bringing creativity, fresh homemade pasta taste and each bite was heavenly.   Shrimp spaghetti - quality, solid dish.  Even had some kick, which I appreciated.

We had a reservation for 5:15, but half of the party was running late due to traffic. The hostesses were very accommodating and allowed my husband and our friend to be seated without us and start ordering food. We arrived about 5:45. The two that beat us there had already discussed timing with the waiter and he was on board with getting us out by 7:10.  Our waiter was knowledgeable about the wine list and how the chef and bartender selected each wine. We went with a nice dry, white blend. He was also very patient with one in our party who has a severe dairy allergy.  We got the mussels for an appetizer to share. It had about 30 mussels which was the perfect size for 5 people. You are also given bread with a wonderful spread of some kind.  Everyone seemed to really enjoy their meals. My husband and both got the Orecchiette pasta. I thought it was very good, but I would have liked some more flavor in the sausage as well as cracked pepper that was never offered to us, but was offered to other tables. We used the table pepper which was hard to get out...  Others in our party had the Farfalle, Herb Pappardelle, Butternut and Acorn Squash Ravioli, and the quail.  We all enjoyed dessert. I was a bit disappointed in mine. I got the cheesecake, which was very good, but was minuscule in size compared to the cake, tiramisu and gelato/sorbeto servings that others got. Overall, it was a very good meal and I could see us coming back again. Note, that the portions here are not the standard Italian American portions, but are much more modest in size. We all were sufficiently full by the end of our meal with no leftovers! We spent around 115 dollars for myself and my husband after splitting up the check accordingly.

The food is more refined than robust, very decent and made with good quality ingredients. My dinner here was at a 30 person event held in a private room.

2016-08-02,4.0,"So, I honestly went back and forth between 3 and 4 stars for this review and decided on the 4 because of my entre'.  We went here this last Saturday evening before a show.  I was very excited because of all of the previous reviews. We had 6:15 reservations and arrived quite early(5:30) because it didn't take us as long to get into the city as we had anticipated.  They were wonderful and seated us immediately, which made for a nice relaxing meal.  We started out with appetizers of steamed mussels and the cheese platter.  Both were very good, but seemed small for the price. Although, when we were finished, we felt there was plenty of food so I guess they're right on with appetizer portions.  I guess we're just used to the LARGE portions you tend to get at other Italian restaurants.  My husband got the Cherry Blossom cocktail which was tasty, but not AMAZING...just tasty. I ordered the scallops and my husband had the veal scaloppini.  My entre' was absolutely wonderful, the most buttery, tender scallops I have ever had (this is what pushed the review to 4 stars).  My husbands meal was meh.  I mean it was good, but nothing really to write home about and to me it was a little salty. We finished off with cappuccino and a pistachio profiterole with a chocolate drizzle, which was the perfect way to finish the meal.  I also had 2 glasses of wine, as did my hubby.  I guess the biggest thing was the price.  The meal was good, atmosphere okay, but worth over $100/person...not so much. Again, really I'd probably go with the 3 1/2 stars if given the option.",0.9862,0.868,0.127,0.005,0.5044276556776556

2016-01-29,4.0,"Came here during Restaurant Week for lunch. I'll have to admit that the biggest driver for coming here was because of the generous birthday coupon sent to my email (up to $40 off lunch or dinner). You can even use it during Restaurant Week!! You just have to go on their website and sign up for their email and enter your birthday. I was conflicted on what to order and was scanning my surrounding environment to see what the dishes looked like for Restaurant Week when lo and behold I spotted a large table of about eight people with various dishes from the Restaurant Week menu. It seemed like people were predominantly ordering the House Made Herb Pappardelle. I wanted to see what the whitefish entree looked like and spotted a guy nearby with it. I saw the crispy onions and what looked like to be a pile of white, textured goo. At first, I thought I was looking at the whitefish with my poor eyesight but my boyfriend oh so lovingly put it, ""Babe, you're looking at the risotto."" (I continue staring.) ""That's the risotto. You're staring at the risotto. The whitefish is gone. He ate it already."" Thanks, honey, thanks. -___- We were given complimentary bread with a cheese dip that I skipped on but my boyfriend loved. It took all my might not to devour the entire loaf of bread and ask for more and then being too full for the rest of lunch. Self-control. *brushes dirt off shoulder* First Course - House Made Minestrone: This was subpar. It perhaps could have used a little more salt. I would recommend ordering a different appetizer. Second Course - House Made Herb Pappardelle: I can see why more people ordered this dish. It was incredibly delicious with the perfect texture for the noodles. Everything just complemented each other in the dish. Third Course - Profiteroles: Despite the waiter telling me how to pronounce it after I asked, I still couldn't pronounce it. The profiteroles were good though! They had more vanilla ice cream than I wanted -- I'm a chocolate person -- but still a decent dessert. The presentation was awesome! The service was spot-on.

The first time we visited Trattoria No. 10, my father was visiting from out of town and we grabbed a bite to eat before heading to a show. We let our waiter know what time the show started and he insured our food and drinks came out in a timely matter, which was one less worry for us.  We were so blown away with how amazing every dish we had was, when he came in town again we knew Trattoria was a must go. When making the reservation I included it was my dad's birthday and anything special they could do for him would be amazing!  Again, the service was absolutely amazing and our server, Steven, was very personable and helped us pick our dinner dishes when we were very indecisive. My father made a point to let Steven know how much we love everything about the restaurant, which he then let his manager know who came up to the table to talk with us as well.

I followed that with a half order of lobster ravioli and a half of sausage.  It was all exquisite.  To end our elegant meal I had a cappuccino and a lemon blueberry Panna cotta. It was the best service we have ever had on New Year's eve. I find that usually you are rushed so they can flip the table. Not here, we were treated like royalty.

2015-11-18,4.0,"My girlfriend and I shared a table in the corner. Work paid for the meal (score!). Interesting space that was well-lit and felt classy. We started with the stuffed calamari. It was delicious. I've never combined prosciutto and little squid before, but it's a great - if salty - combo. Not a bad portion for this scale of restaurant, and very share-able. Most bites were tender and delicious, but a couple were chewy. Nothing wrong with that in my book. Flavor was exceptional. Over the course of the night, we each had a couple mixed drinks, all off of their cocktail menu. Well-made, didn't skimp on the booze. Getting those early in the meal with some empty bellies certainly warmed us right up! Almost simultaneously with the calamari, we were served our romaine salad. They forgot the seasonal blueberries, but that was forgiven. We requested a different dressing, which she put in, and the chef then advised us against. Ended up going with some sort of sweet vinaigrette that went very well with everything in the salad. Good suggestion. Speaking of the service, our waitress was attentive, despite helping a large party nearby and several other tables. She seemed a little flustered at times, but never once rushed us or failed to adequately answer our questions. Our main course was a strip steak that was perfectly cooked, sliced easily, and as I recall was covered with an amazing red wine and peppercorn glace. Highlight of the night. We finished with some profiteroles with a variety of small scoops of ice cream. They were challenging to eat because they ""squished"" but damn they were delicious. Overall 4.4.

That said, some may say it's all quality over quantity, and I get that.  Again, that mushroom thing tasted fantastic.   ...But I also think it wasn't anything mind-bogglingly special, and that you can get lots of great dishes at restaurants that are much cheaper.

Just last night I had another great dinner there with my wife, who - for the record - is much better company than any client that I ever had.  And better looking, too! You can read about menu items on other reviews here on Yelp.  I just want to add this: Trattoria No. 10 is one of the very best restaurants in Chicago.  And I know my restaurants.  The food is always delicious.  The atmosphere is always special.  And the service, in my experience, has always been excellent. For you out-of-towners or locals who have never been here, know that:  Having dinner - or lunch - is going to be very good.  Any negative comments on Yelp are from reviewers who: 1) Had, for some strange reason, a very, very rare, not-so-great experience, or; 2) Just don't know what they're talking about.  Probably many more of the #2 variety! If you're budget conscious, know that you can have a special night out with your ""special other"" and - without alcohol - spend no more than $65-$70 for a couple entrees and an appetizer, including a tip.  If you like to enjoy a couple drinks or wine with your meal, you are looking at $90-$100 by making careful selections from the menu.  And, of course, you can always spend more!  My point here is that you don't have to order the most expensive items from the menu to have an absolutely delicious meal at Trattoria No. 10.  One that you will really enjoy.  And an evening that will leave you with a special memory, too.

The presentation was beautiful and the ravioli had whole shrimp not minced up like some places. The prawns on top were cooked perfectly and the salad that was on top paired perfectly. My bf had the grass fed beef and the smaller portion on the sausage ravioli. The steak for was as thick as it was it was tender, juicy and very flavorful. It also had rapini which he loves and I'm not a fan of but I actually liked it. It was cooked the right way. It wasn't bitter. We also had the arugula salad with the buffalo mozzarella it was so fresh and so light. We also got dessert. We decided on two cause we couldn't decide on just one.

I recommend reservations and let the staff know you're seeing a show- they timed our meal perfectly. First we had the potato leek soup and arugula salad. Both amazing. I thought mozzarella with apples in a salad wouldn't go, but it's just a few tiny pieces and trust me...they do.  Then we ordered the ravioli. You have to get this because it's what their known for and this is the best ravioli I've ever had. If you randomly asked me what my favorite food was I would say ravioli so I've tried it at many different places. By far this is the best. I had the ravioli with asparagus and that was really creamy. I preferred the butternut squash ravioli, the inside was so sweet and the ravioli literally melted in your mouth. All dishes you can order full or half sizes we did half and shared everything to try more. Steak was great and they allowed us to share with two different cooking styles. The waitress was very accommodating. They have grass fed beef and use local farms.

Trattoria No. 10 could be a nice place for lunch but it was a perfect place for a quick and delicious girls' dinner. Our server was delightful and didn't judge when my friend and I each had two glasses of wine in about 50 minutes. Start with the gnocchi, the pieces are lightly crispy, almost like a breakfast potato, and the contrast with the creamy ricotta cheese is surprising. For dinner, you can't go wrong with any of the ravioli, as that is what Trattoria is known for. However, I broke tradition and ordered the parapadelle with chicken and was not disappointed in the slightest. The ragu was the perfect consistency and the noodles were certainly homemade (or tasted that way!). For dessert, get the house made gelato or sorbet, both are bursting with flavor!

Off of a smaller street though, so we had difficulty getting a cab afterwards and Uber drivers just couldn't seem to find us. Kind of a cool place, in the basement (you have to go downstairs). Service: Wonderful, our waiter was very attentive and the hostess at the beginning was similarly kind and helpful.  Ambiance: Fairly casual, I was wearing jeans and didn't feel out of place. We were seated very close to a large party so it was louder than I would have liked, but that's not the restaurant's fault.  Food: I had the butternut squash ravioli, the tagliatelle with shrimp and scallops, and the apple crostata. All were wonderful, no complaints about any of the food. The ravioli starter was tasty though portions were very small (they give you about 4 ravioli total). The tagliatelle was a real standout - it had plenty of shrimp, scallops and calamari (unlike some places where they really skimp on the seafood!) and tons of pasta underneath. Well-seasoned. The apple crostata was warm and yummy with a scoop of gelato. Filled with raisins and cranberries as well, so a medley of fruits really instead of just apples. Each dessert also came with a cute chocolate sauce decoration of #CRW for Chicago Restaurant Week!  Interesting to note - the bread at the beginning doesn't come with butter. Instead they gave us what seemed like a hummus (it was some kind of bean spread). It was delicious so I enjoyed it, but maybe not for everyone.

The Mister had a wedge salad which came with tasty Gorgonzola and crispy prosciutto. Trattoria 10 specializes in ravioli which they make in house - you can get a full or half portion (same thing on pastas) making it great for a lighter meal. I went for the spicy Italian sausage version and loved it. Unlike most places, Trattoria 10 doesn't drown ravioli in sauce - my dish had dollops on top of each individual ravioli which was then garnished with generous shavings of Parmesan. It really was spicy too - definitely would order this again. My husband went with the scallops and he said they were perfectly cooked. Presentation was lovely - they were served with a mixture of orzo and julienned vegetables.

We were treated to a menu with many items that looked delicious.  I had two menu items, see reviews below: Beet ""Ravioli"" Antipasti: (4 stars) This dish was playfully served and very good.  The ""ravioli"" are really large, thin slices of red and yellow beets with goat cheese in the middle.  Like six beet/goat cheese sandwiches. Day Boat Scallops: (4 stars-$32) These scallops were a mixed bag: the scallops themselves were five-star.  They were perhaps the most moist and succulent scallops I've had; juicy, marinated, yet plenty firm, they were awesome.  The rest of the plate was 2-star: overly acidic salad greens without much to them paired with five baked potato wedges that were devoid of flavor.  If they had been seasoned and served with some ketchup they would have made average potato wedges, but as they were they were just lousy.  A few bites were all I could muster.",0.8098,0.866,0.1,0.034,0.510079365079365

We had to repeat the order slowly a few times which is annoying. He checked on us and should have seen and removed the two empty plates that were there for a good 15 minutes. There are also no specials here, which I found weird. It seemed like everything on the menu either cream sauce, fish,or  asparagus on it. It's an Italian place, would it kill you to put something in a red sauce? Oh god, here's the kicker: This is where I got the worst old fashioned of my life. I never even went past 1 sip of it. It was a muddled mush of bad orange and maraschino fruit throughout it & way too much sweetness. It was $13.25 for a very small old fashioned, even though he charged me for Makers Mark rather than Knob Creek. That's just ridiculous. I had the Caprese Salad which was a complete disappointment. Swimming in oil with big chunks of random tomatoes, and for some reason, they salted the mozzarella chunk in the middle but not the tomatoes. I also had the Corn Chowder which looked cool when they brought out the bowl with garnishes and were going to hand pour the soup over the garnishes, but unfortunately what was poured out of it was chunky cream of chicken, oversalted nastiness. Bleh! That should only be done with a pureed soup anyway. Not something with chunks of chicken and vegetables in it. My other half, in addition to our nasty old fashioneds, had the shrimp ravioli and said the pasta was undercooked and it was incredibly bland. Caprese Salad, Corn Chowder, Shrimp Ravioli, and two Old Fashioned cocktails ran us $85. Never again. Yuck.",-0.937,0.847,0.046,0.107,0.5018137254901961

2014-07-13,5.0,"First time at Trattoria No. 10. I was having lunch with a friend in The Loop, so I was looking for a place with valet parking. The Yelp entry said there was valet parking here, so away we go. Long story short, there is no valet here until 5PM. There is metered parking, though. We only had an hour and we had a reservation, so I nervously parked between the poles in front of the restaurant so I could figure it out later. Our server's name was Sarah. I asked her if it was okay to park where I parked and she did not know. I decided to order first, then figure out parking. We ordered and I went back out to deal with my car. I asked the maitre'd if parking between the poles out front was okay and she didn't know. She asked how I found out about their valet parking and I told her I saw it on Yelp. I went outside and spoke to the people smoking outside. I figured they would know since they work in the area. They said where I parked was metered parking. I was relieved and paid for my spot at the box. Once I got back to our table, a different woman approached us. I think she was the MOD. She apologized for the parking situation and said she would get in touch with Yelp to clarify things so this doesn't happen again. She seemed very serious about it. She offered us a free entree for the inconvenience. I was pleasantly surprised, because in all honesty, my parking situation wasn't their problem. Our drinks and appetizer (Carpaccio) came quickly, and our food shortly after that. Both entrees (Ravioli w/sausage and Orrichiette pasta) were outstanding (we sampled each others food). The bonus entree (Ravioli with butternut and acorn squash) was killer, too. I ordered dessert (warm apple crosata) to go. While we we waiting for it, Sarah brought us a full order of tiramisu to try.   In summary, this place is awesome. Sarah was great server.

Craft beers out of the bottle and no drafts. Liquor pours were $12+ and things just kept going down hill. Uninviting to say the least. Table service was a step above. Our waitress knew her stuff top to bottom and helped make recommendations for wine (pointing out the most expensive bottles first of course). Bread was fresh out the oven and a field green salad to start. Readied myself for the black tagliatelle pasta. Great dish and I was overall impressed with the cuisine. Everyone else seemed pleased.  Of course, no split checks. Should have seen that coming. It was one let down after another. Perhaps we didn't fit in with the theater crowd?

We were seated as soon as we arrived, and despite being VERY crowded considering the evening, we were seated far enough away from other people so that it didn't feel like we were sitting on top of someone else's conversation. Wait staff was very friendly and attentive. We never felt like we were being rushed by our waiter--he gave us plenty of time to order and was attentive without being pushy, which can be hard to do. But we definitely took our time--we were probably at our table for over two hours and were one of the last ones to leave the restaurant.  And I understand that it was probably after 11:00 by this point, but I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 because people started to come around and take off table cloths and stack the tables to sweep the floors WHILE we were still sitting their finishing our meal. I found this to be rude, and even though our waiter was not rushing us or making us feel like we had to hurry and leave, this definitely sent that vibe.  The restaurant is divided up in to a number of smaller rooms, and I felt like they could have at least started with an empty room, or just waited until the restaurant was empty. When you're paying that much for dinner, you definitely don't want to feel like you're a nuisance to those working, or like you're the one preventing them from going home or something.

Very delicious and very filling. My mom also ordered the adorable baked baby pumpkin with chanterelle mushrooms and cipollini onions as an appetizer. Yummy! They have an extensive wine list, but I opted for a delicious Wisconsin stout. Nice bonus? They make a point of using local farmers as much as possible and list the names of many of their vendors on the menu.

Farfalle Pasta - This was a good dish.  The flavors were rich and the duck was nice. Ravioli w/Butternut & Acorn Squash - This was much sweeter than I expected and almost tasted like dessert after eating the farfalle.  It was better than the octopus, but I wouldn't order it again. However our server was very attentive, friendly, and helpful with wine suggestions.  She was also very accommodating when our group had a mix up in timing and the second half of the group showed up 45 minutes after the first.

2013-07-09,5.0,"This restaurant was utterly amazing. My bride & I were given a $150 gift card, and we intended to use it. And boy, did we ever. First, it's not a flashy place looking at it from the outside. There is a valet, $12 bucks to leave a car there while eating & $14 if you want to catch a show after dinner. The wait staff: one of the most courteous, generous and helpful crews ever. Our waiter was outstanding. We tipped appropriately.  The menu changes from day-to-day; on one side there are listings for the locally-sourced food items for the day. If you're interested in that sort of thing or it's important to you, that's probably enough to get you in the door. The other side of the menu lists the entrees, appetizers for the day. We had Caprese ""salad"" with Buffalo Mozzarella. At first I was concerned about the lack of any kind of Balsamic vinegar; after we devoured everything in several minutes, we'd forgotten there wasn't any. It wasn't necessary. The tomatoes were fresh, seasoned perfectly; the cheese was perfect; and the fresh basil leaves tasted like they were picked earlier that afternoon. One of the cool things about some of the pasta/ravioli items on the menu is that you can have some as an appetizer. The portions are app-appropirate. We did this for the butternut/acorn squash ravioli. HIGLY RECOMMENDED. Holy crap were they good. The bread on the table is the typical (the way it should be at an Italian restaurant) crusty white Italian bread. The spread? NOT butter. It's a mix of ground beans, lemon juice, oregano, and other ingredients I've forgotten...but the taste I won't. It's simple in the best possible way. The loaves of bread went down very easily. So after the two appetizers, it was time for the 2nd course. I chose the veal; it was OUTSTANDING. Made with shallots, white wine, garlic, mushrooms, finely-chopped tomatoes & other ingredients, it was made PERFECTLY. Super-tender, packed with flavor in every bite. Thankfully I'd saved some bread for after everything was gone...needed something to sop up the remaining sauce/juice. Wow.  Good thing was that the onions in this dish were NOT the kind you taste for hours afterward. I hate that...and tend to shy away from green onions/any kind of onions. I love them, but not the aftertaste. With this veal dish, I had no problem eating all the onions. Don't know how they did it, but there was zero aftertaste.  My bride had a Panka-breaded chicken dish with vegetables, quartered tomatoes and a creme-fresh-type cheese (that's not what it was I'm sure, we're just not sure what kind of white, goat-cheese-like cheese it was) that was light, fresh, and uh-maze-ing. Everything about her dish was outstanding. There were tiny snap peas in pods that had flavor like I've never had before. Another win! She had a martini with a rare, from France liqueur that was floral, but not overly, plus citrus-y. I don't care for alcohol much at all, but her martini was outstanding.  Dessert: Tiramisu for her (unreal) and warm apple crostada for me (Granny Smith apples, walnuts, cranberries, raisins) in a homemade crust with vanilla gelato lightly sprinkled with cinnamon. ZOMG. WANTED MOAR. We used every penny of that gift card, and were not sorry that we did so. This place is terrific. The key here: go EARLY. I'll never understand why people want to eat a huge meal at 8:00 PM and then go to bed shortly thereafter. No way. We got there a little after they opened their doors (they opened at 5pm on the weekday we went), and were seated immediately without a reservation. If you like to eat at 9:00 PM at night, you best reserve a table. Otherwise, go early, zero issues.  Highly recommended. We don't eat out a ton, so when we do we want it to be worth the dollars we spend. Trattoria No. 10 may have displaced our yearly standby for our wedding anniversary celebratory dinner.

He knew a lot about the menu, offered up great suggestions and then also gave the reason for his suggestions. I had the farfalle with duck confit, asparagus and pine nuts. He mentioned that it was an item that has been on the menu for over 20 years. I simply had to try it after hearing that (I am also a huge fan of duck...and asparagus...and pine nuts). I must say, it was amazing. The duck was tender and the sauce (which was only the juice from the duck, really) was out of this world. I started to eat it and didn't want it to end. But it did (though it took awhile as the portion was a decent size).  Dessert was amaretto cheesecake. Also amazing. Not overly sweet, not super creamy like your typical cheesecake. It was more 'rustic' and I'm glad it was. It went with the overall theme and feel of the restaurant.  I would definitely come back here and would probably order the same thing.

2013-05-17,3.0,"I was excited when Trattoria 10 was suggested for a business lunch; Italian food is a major staple in my diet. I didn't even bristle knowing it would be the 4th out of 5 Italian meals I was partaking in that week, including one that very evening. I've always wondered about this space; it seemed strange that a $$$ restaurant was located in a windowless basement below Sopraffina. Somehow Trattoria 10 pulls it off, and on a gloomy Chicago afternoon, I would've preferred to stay inside than venture back into the windy, overcast day. While Trattoria 10 was a good place for a business meeting, I wasn't overly impressed with my meal, the ravioli with asparagus, aged provolone, onions and sun-dried tomatoes. My biggest complaints are two. First, my pasta was too al dente or firm. Personally, I think you should be able to easily cut ravioli with the edge of a fork; mine required the aid of my butter knife. Second, my meal was oversalted. It's unusual for me to complain about the amount of salt in a meal, as I am usually the first to reach for the salt shaker. However, in this case all I was reaching for was my glass of water to try and blunt some of the saltiness of my meal. Should I have sent the dish back? Probably, but I didn't want to disrupt the flow of our business lunch or insult my host who quite adores the place. Despite the lackluster food, the service was attentive and friendly. Glasses were filled regularly on cue and our server was there when we needed him without feeling like he hovered. Since Trattoria 10's menu changes seasonally, I would give them another shot.

Had the wild mushroom risotto accompanied by an arugula salad. Everything was super fresh and the salad was a larger portion than I thought it would be. While the entree dishes were expected to be of smaller plates, it was still very satisfying and not as small as other higher-end restaurants. The risotto itself was decent. While it had plenty of various mushrooms, it did not have as robust of a mushroom flavor as I would have liked. I think think was attributed to the slight overly cream-heaviness of the dish.

The wine list was awesome and it made me happy to see that they included wines from the Umbria region, which I had just visited. Our waiter was incredibly helpful along with the rest of the staff. I have never been to a restaurant where even the bus boys were attentive to what we needed. The spread that came with the bread was a nice change from olive oils and butters. I had the panko crusted chicken breast with the hunter sauce and was surprised to see that I was given a portion of THREE chicken breasts. This made for a wonderful day after lunch! The root mash that came with came with the chicken was indescribably good. My date had two appetizer plates of ravioli. The sausage ravioli was delicious, but the butternut squash ravioli was out of this world! We both agreed that if we visit this restaurant again (which we fully plan on), we will order a full portion each, because sharing was incredibly hard! We also sprung on dessert. The profiteroles were to die for. We did the vanilla, caramel, and chocolate gelatos with our profiteroles (which are like cream puffs stuffed with gelato and drizzled in chocolate sauce). The gelato was better than even the best gelato I had in Italy, with the caramel topping the list. If you get dinner here and don't get the profiteroles for dessert, you are truly missing out. It was also a great place to go to before the theatre. They got us in and out in a convenient, yet not rushed, time.

Our waiter was attentive and the food arrived fast.  i started off the first course with the Butternut Squash Ravioli topped with freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Delicious. The ravioli was soft and doughy and the herbs and vegetables made it surprisingly refreshing. When my fork found the puréed butternut squash, it was like discovering gold. I then had the fettuccine with shrimp and sun-dried tomatoes and leeks (i believe). It was pretty average and could have done well with a sauce or a thinner pasta. For dessert, tiramisu, which again, was pretty average, but still good.

Went here tonight with 2 friends to check out their restaurant week menu.  $33 bucks for an appetizers, entree, and dessert is a decent deal.   It ended up being $65/pp with a glass of wine and tip.   Really not worth it - bad pick on our part. Appetizers were good.  I had the butternut squash ravioli and my friends had the mushroom ragu.  All were flavorful, smallish portion size. You had 3 entrees to pick from.  I had the  fettuccine with shrimp, sun dried and grape tomatoes, leeks, fennel and a saffron butter sauce.  It was good and the shrimp were amazing.   My friends both had the Ravioli filled with asparagus tips and aged provolone cheese, onions, and a sundried tomato sauce.    They both said it was not good and not fully cooked - hard and chewy.  Personally, I would have sent it back, but they did not. Desserts were decadent, as only desserts can be.  The restaurant was loud - it was hard to carry on a conversation at our table.    Everyone is on top of each other - not well laid out.

It's proximity to the theater district was great.  The friendly staff did a good job of getting us in and out of the restaurant too.  Perfect pre-show spot if you give yourself enough time.

We were promptly seated and while the restaurant was relatively empty at that point, it soon began to fill up. Because Yelpers mentioned the ravioli a lot, that's what we went with. I went with the butternut squash ravioli while my husband went with the spicy sausage variety. Both were excellent, but I'd actually say that I enjoyed the spicy sausage more than the butternut squash. Both were light and delicious, and the portion was just right!

2012-12-08,5.0,"This 100th Yelp review is dedicated to one of my very favorite restaurants in Chicago, if not the universe.  I've dined at Trattoria No. 10 countless times over the last decade under a myriad of circumstances: business lunches, private events, romantic dinners, and can't recall ever feeling less than completely satisfied making the ascent up back to street level.  About a year ago, I was diagnosed with gluten intolerance. While I remain cognizant this is entirely insignificant in comparison to many people's health challenges, I am a foodie through and through, and at the time felt like a piece of my soul died the day  limitations were placed on my gastronomic assault on the world. While I've found many restaurants' gluten-free menus comprised of unimaginative, lackluster offerings, Trattoria No. 10 *shines* in the gluten-free arena. Their scrumptious pasta preparations can be made with quinoa linguini, and there are always several appetizers & entree options that are naturally gluten-free, or can be made so with a minor alteration. The service at Trattoria never disappoints; you're made to feel like you're the only table in the restaurant. The servers are well-versed on the menu, and aren't afraid to make a suggestion. During our last visit, the waiter talked me out of the pinot noir I was eyeing in favor of an Italian red he felt would pair better with the entrees we'd selected. His selection was dead on. I recommend Trattoria No. 10 without hesitation. If you enjoy fresh, seasonal food made with care and great service, you will love this restaurant. They also have a 'Special Occasion Club' you can join via their website to be emailed special offers & gift certificates.

I literally could not believe how amazing this dish was. - And the Chocolate Truffle Cake was sinfully good. Although the Smutty Dog Old Brown Dog Ale wasn't made there it was also delicious (they have a very good beer menu).

I walked so delicately in my 5 and a half inch heels down those stairs but still managed to sound like an elephant :) I was cracking jokes about myself and the staff at the hostess stand happily joined in.....I liked that. Our waiter, a gentleman whose name I cannot remember, was the best I have had in a LONG time. Attentive but not pushy, he let us gesture to him when we wanted to order, paced our meal perfectly, and as far as I am concerned while he was dealing with other patrons he never really took his attention off of us. I venture to guess everyone else in his section had the same lovely experience. Now on to the good stuff. THE FOOD! Tratorria is a certified green, sustainable restaurant and they list the farms they get their proteins and produce from on the menu....Local!! I LOVED THIS!!! The bread isn't served with butter, but with pureed garbanzo beans mixed with a few other things that I couldn't place, but YUM! I started with the Minestrone that was served table side from an individual carafe/container. Hearty and light, with big chunks of veggies that were cooked perfectly. The boyfriend has the potato leek soup which I of course tried and it was DELICIOUS! The better of the two soups. Trattoria no. 10 is known for their housemade ravioli, so why would I order anything else? I had the roasted corn ravioli that was served with shrimp, pancetta, and a light cream sauce. I really do mean a light sauce, it was not heavy and the perfect amount was served......it wasn't like so many places that drown the pasta in the sauce. Here at Trattoria, they want you to taste the pasta and it is well worth it. The mixture of the roasted corn with the shrimp and pancetta was delightful. A flavor profile I would not of thought of, but I suppose that is why I am not a chef. The boyfriend had a heirloom tomato ravioli that was served cold, with sliced heirloom tomatoes on top as opposed to a sauce. He was happy, or at least I assume so being that he ate his in what seemed like 10 seconds :) This is a great spot for all the theater goers in this area of the city.

Grilled Rhode Island Calamari: very nice appetizer.  I prefer huge chunks of calamari but here the calamari is more of an ingredient rather than the centerpiece.  Served on crostini with what seemed like a light coating of cheese.  Asparagus is semi-crunchy. Ravioli with House Made Spicy Sausage: the sauce was rich and delicious, pasta was firm yet soft, sausage tasted fresh. I'd get it again.

I wish I could have tried the sausage ravioli, the duck pasta or the octopus dish. Unfortunately we ended up settling on 2 salads(both decent), parmesan ravioli(pretty good), black pasta(a little spicy, but not too much flavor) and the polenta(unique with the figs, but nothing special). The table bread was also lackluster.  The only redeeming quality of this meal was the dessert. We shared the sampler dessert and picked the tiramisu, profiteroles and pistachio gelato cup.

The mushroom ragu was rich, spicy, tangy with the crisp crostinis on top sopping up the ragu and topped with a local farm goat cheese and it all complimented each other perfectly. The ravioli was fresh and cooked perfectly al dente stuffed with a generous heap of cheese and asparagus tips, laid over a dried tomato sauce.  For our main course we went with all three options.. the butternut squash ravioli, tenderloin tips with pasta and the  roasted white fish served with a wild mushroom and pea pollenta.

All I have to say is WOW! I loved everything about this dish and it didn't even have any carbs! I seriously drenched the pork in the delicious demi glace sauce. The acorn squash went perfect with the pork. The bf had the steak with mashed potatoes. I was really jealous of his dish because the potatoes were so good. For desert I had to get the chocolate truffle cake. It was fantastic, but I was so full so I took it home. Dinner was great, but it did run about $100 for 2 drinks, 1 app, 2 dinners, and 1 desert.

The ambiance was nice except that it was very odd to enter the front door and not see the restaurant.  It's down a flight of stairs.  Now for the food.  First we ordered a Caesar salad.  The lettuce was intentionally singed and burned in some places. That's really strange and did nothing to make it tastier.  The dressing was not traditional and ok, but not exceptional.  There was a small tomato (not usual to a Caesar salad) and some anchovy.  Neither my wife nor myself cared for the salad. Next came the ravioli with spicy sausage. The marinara sauce looked and tasted as if it came out of a bottle.  The sausage was not particularly spicy nor tasty.  My wife liked the dish better than I did, but I was very disappointed. Last was the veal cutlet with pancetta.  Three small pieces of veal in a creamy sauce with a taste of cinnamon.  The sauce contained some capers and sliced nuts, possibly almonds.  Again, very disappointing.  It felt as if the chef had thrown together various ingredients as an experiment.  And cinnamon in veal cutlet?  What were they thinking?

We arrived on time and were immediately seated.  The restaurant only had a few tables empty which is why it was curious that they placed us at the table by the entrance to the kitchen. Before arriving we looked at their menu online.  For weeks my girlfriend was excited for the Lobster stuffed Ravioli.  It wasn't on the menu.  We were told they update their menu daily and clearly didn't have lobster.  Almost immediately my girlfriend's experience was soured. Two types of bread were served before orders were taken.  One was a regular white bread with salt on top and the other was a cheddar crispy bread.  Both were actually quite good. Service was fair.  The waitress took a while to even take our drink orders.  She also took a while to bring us our bill.  Another small was point is that she seemed a bit cold and clinical.  However, service in between that was pretty punctual.  Especially the food which was served to us maybe ten minutes after our order was placed. I had a risotto with smoked bacon which turns out was very good.  Perfect blend of creaminess in the sauce and smokey bacon flavor.  My girlfriend had a sausage stuffed ravioli.  It wasn't too bad but nothing exceptional.  Mine was better. The environment is nice.  As the evening went on it got a lot more crowded but wasn't all that loud.  It was dimly lit but the ceiling had individual lights shining on each table so it was never too dark. Prices are variably decent.  I had a good dish for $13.  It didn't look like a lot but was pleasantly filling.  Wine was $8 a glass.  Maybe it is because I'm not into wine, but the price for that felt a bit steep. My rating for the restaurant is pretty challenging.  The food itself was pretty good.  Prices may have been slightly high, at least for the wine.  Service was mediocre.  My girlfriend's disappointment in the inaccurate online menu may be souring my experience too. Trattoria No. 10 isn't a bad restaurant by any means.  The food was good but the whole experience wasn't amazing.  What is pushing me from a 4 to a 3 is my doubt that I would recommend it to someone else.  In a small town lacking a nice restaurant, I would think this place is phenomenal.  There just have to be better restaurants in a city like Chicago which moreso deserve the 4 stars.",0.9924,0.804,0.147,0.048,0.6094384615384614

We got to the restaurant around 6:30 or so.  It's an odd entrance...you immediately have to go down the stairs or the elevator to get to the main dining area.  I like the ambiance there...it was very cozy with dim--but not dark--lighting.  The bar would be a great place to grab drinks after work. We were brought some really yummy bread instantly and our waiter came quickly to take our drink orders.  We both opted for Martinis, which were about $12.00 each.  We ordered our food soon after and it came quickly as well--we both had the Spicy Sausage Ravioli.  I thought it was pretty solid.  The sausage was really good--moderately spicy with great flavor and the ravioli was cooked perfectly.  I was not a big fan of the sauce, though.  For lack of a better way to explain, it tasted fake or canned.  Good thing the sausage was so good that it outshined the rest of the dish.  I would have like to see the portions a bit bigger too, for the price that we paid. We both decided to have dessert after--I got the Profiteroles and she got the Chocolate cake.  Both were excellent.  I wish that I had been hungry enough to finish all of mine.  Unlike the entrees, I was very pleased with the size of the desserts.  We probably should have just shared one, but what's the fun in that?    Our bill totaled about $85 bucks and if we hadn't talked so long during dinner, we wouldn't have had to run to get to our play at 7:30.  The service was good and fast and the evening was very enjoyable.  I would recommend it to any pre-theater folks.",0.9921,0.808,0.172,0.021,0.5497962962962962

The carpaccio was quite nice.  Entrees were the spicy sausage ravioli, steak garganelli, risotto, and pork tenderloin. The tenderloin and ravioli were both outstanding. The risotto and garganelli were both good. The appetizer portions were quite small.  Dessert was a trio of profiteroles, tiramisu, and the chocolate truffle cake. Profiteroles are one of my very favorite desserts and these did not let me down. They were filled with an outstanding vanilla ice cream, rather than the traditional cream or custard. The tiramisu had an excellent taste, but had more liquid on it than normal and was quite soggy. The truffle cake was good, but nothing spectacular.  The service was good and our waiter was careful to make sure we made it to our show, which was much appreciated. The ambiance was warm and comfortable.

The food was decent--their best entree is the squash ravioli in a lemon butter sauce, delicious and melts in your mouth. The sausage ravioli was a bit too spicy for my taste. The minestrone was decent and the soup of the day, the cream of mushroom, was a bit too strong or pungent or something. Service was excellent. There are many tables so no wait to get seated.

It was very good... flavorful sauce and not too much of it. The only thing I might change would be to add more chicken. I tried my friends' sausage ravioli and chicken, and both were delicious as well. The service was spot on. Attentive but not overly so. One odd thing happened though. They kept pulling out a ladder and adjusting the track lights in our area. It happened at least 3-4 times throughout our meal. I guess they're trying to personalize the lighting?

The service was prompt and friendly, and accommodating to our large party. I started with the delicious tomato basil soup and ordered the famous butternut & acorn squash ravioli for the main course. DELICIOUS. I am still thinking about the ravioli and finding an excuse to go back there as soon as possible. It had a wonderful butter sauce with chopped nuts (walnuts?) on top. Probably the best entree I've eaten all year. I had the chocolate gelato for dessert, which, quite honestly, was not that great. It tasted more like chocolate ice cream. It didn't have that creamy gelato goodness that I'm used to. But, it's still chocolate and tasty. If you go to this restaurant, I highly recommend you to try the ravioli -- you can also order a smaller portion as an appetizer.

The food is great, and their quick, efficient service will ensure that you make your curtain call on time.  If you are really in a hurry, or want to stop by after work to fill up- Mon - Friday they have a $12 buffet that has all sorts of beautiful salads and meats (quite the spread) in the bar area. It looked delicious but we opted to sit down and order off the menu ( I, for once, was actually early for our reservation as the ""traffic gods"" were smiling yesterday!).  I am a big sharer of food and I love when a restaurant splits it in the kitchen for me and then brings it out. Our serving team took the time to do this with both our appetizer and our dessert. Way to go!  We started with the prosciutto plate. It was supposed to come with pineapple but since I have an issue with citrus, they just added a few more slices of the delicious meat. Interesting combination of flavors as it was served with nuts and slivered mint.  Next up for our appetizer we split the spicy beef ravioli, and spicy is was! Splitting it was perfect as we each got 3 raviolis as any more would have been too much.  And finally for our entrees-we went with the server's recommendation of the lamb osso bucco and the veal scallopini. Both were delicious but in my book the veal was the winner.  Glancing at our watches we quickly split the highly touted apple crostini which was just as good as our server said it would be.  Love the location as it is intimate and cozy (it is actually below street level) and that the server's know that their ""bread and butter"" is from the theater crowd so they do an excellent job in getting you in, out and on your way (in our case all that food in a little over an hour and we didn't feel rushed).

Some examples: not asking about drinks when the server was at the table and there were empty glasses, not serving the lady first, reaching across people to pre-bus while holding a stack of already-cleared dishes in someone's face, and food runner dropping off a tray of food that doesn't get served by the server for 2-3 minutes.

We were seated in the bar area, and the atmosphere is quite nice.  In fact, the atmosphere in the entire restaurant is really pleasant.  It would be a great place to bring a date (at least as far as the atmosphere is concerned). We ordered an appetizer (prosciutto) that was quite tasty but overpriced.  The plate came with four very small slices of prosciutto, a bit of mozzarella, and some greens.  Everything was really good, but there wasn't much of it for $12.  We also ordered salads, which at $8 were overpriced given the quality. For dinner I ordered risotto, and my friend had one of the ravioli dishes.  I didn't finish my entree because the taste of the risotto was so bland.  The dish was dominated by a single flavor - cheese - and it was really unimpressive for $23.  My friend liked his ravioli well enough, but there weren't many on the plate considering the $18 price tag. In addition to our food we each had a beer, and the total came out to approximately $90.  A terrible value.  I might go back, but it won't be something I am eager to do.  For my money, I prefer the less expensive ""comfort"" Italian food that they serve at the Italian Village.",0.993,0.801,0.174,0.025,0.5466014739229024
2008-02-25,4.0,"How NOT to be seen while eating at an Italian restaurant... First, most of the places above ground will charge you an arm and a leg, plus everyone sees you in the restaurant.  Second, the food is usually MEDIOCRE at best.  You can get the same food at half the price without a waiter at a cafeteria elsewhere.  Other restaurants with ""Italian"" in their name are VERY mediocre and a total tourist trap. Trattoria No. 10 is a real restaurant in the middle of the loop that has great Italian food. ENVIRONMENT:  Dark, quiet, private tables that let you hide in a corner.  The bar is good too.   LUNCH:  The Italian food is very good.  It is a lot of pasta in rich sauces, or a meat dish with a side.  Not exactly your Zbarro's offering in volume, but more than enough in quality.  I had the pasta with duck confit and vegetables (pasta tossed with a good serving of boneless dark duck meat, in a rich duck sauce with peas, carrots and other root vegetables).  My lunch friend had a hazelnut ravioli in a pumpkin sauce (try that with gorgonzola and it just makes the dish).  Caesar and Italian salads, plus traditional panini sandwiches are also available at a reasonable price. It all comes with a very good bread basket, full of a nice assortment of artisan breads and flatbreads. DESSERTS:  At lunch, they have a dessert menu.  Tiramisu and strawberry cheesecake looked good, but we didn't have time. CAVEATS:  It IS a trek down the stairs or by elevator.  Also, its a little pricey.  Lunch ranges from $10-$15 for one dish.  A drink and a plate with tip will cost you about $16-20 per person.  BUT, what you are paying for is PRIVACY.  Also, expect to stay the full hour for lunch (no express here). In all, take your lunch date, your early dinner, or your theatre date here if you want to escape the rush of the loop at an upscale restaurant hideaway at a slight premium.",0.9879,0.873,0.114,0.013,0.42724747474747476

Service was prompt, friendly, and very nice.  The only complaint on the service was that I had ordered my veal scallopini with no asparagus and it still came out with it (the waitress was willing to take it back, but I told her to give me a minute to see if the flavor had seeped into anything else - since it hadn't I just moved to the side). I personally loved the atmosphere of cozy, stucco walls.  It was a great romantic ambiance without being overkill.

My entree, however, was only okay.  I had veal scallopini in a lemon reduction, but I couldn't taste the lemon.  And the dish included melted Fontina, which was everywhere, and sadly overpowering.  The veal itself was almost too thick to be a scallopini, and while it wasn't tough as shoe leather, it didn't melt in my mouth either.  My boyfriend had a Waygu beef, which was fatty and bland, with a corn/pancetta side dish, which was inspired.  Our other dining companion had the butternut squash ravioli, which she did say was the best she'd had a in long time.  So that's a plus.

2007-06-26,4.0,"I was in town solo for a business trip and didn't want to eat the spew the hotel was shilling.  My selection criteria was (1) something close to the Palmer House, (2) something of quality and (3) not a chain.   A perusal of various web reviews led me to T#10, and when it was all over I was not sad. My reservation was made on line via  opentable.com .  I like this service and it rewards frequent use.  The fact that T#10 was on opentable was a plus but not a selection criteria. I was greeted promptly and politely by the hostess and shown to a table.  Although I was dining by myself, I was not given a crappy table in the back of the room.  Some places treat solo diners  as lower than whale S&^t, but this was not the case here. My server was well informed about the menu.  I quizzed her about the things I was considering and she made appropriate recommendations.  She was at first a bit timid about making wine suggestions, but with additional prompting came up with something excellent at a reasonable price. The meal iteself was excellent.  My first course was a roast beet salad, composed with goat cheese, pine nuts and flavored oils.  Very tasty.  I then had ravioli made with spicy sausage and tomato sauce.  The ravioli was obviously house made and quite good, and the portion size was perfectly filling without being ridiculously huge.   My only moment of non-mirth came with the desert menu.  I had a glass of wine remaining from my bottle with dinner and was hoping for a cheese course with which to finish it off.  Alas, no cheese.  The sweets looked good but my wine looked better, so no desert.  I should mention that a selection of grappas was also offered, which is a plus for when you just can't say no to grappa. Recap:  Staff polite, service professional, food well executed.  I would return and would recommend T#10 to friends as well.",0.9943,0.752,0.187,0.061,0.6033333333333333
2007-06-13,4.0,"I ate here yesterday for a late lunch and I think I may still be full today. Everything was PHENOMENAL.  My office gathered here for a wedding shower for our manager, so the appetizers had already been selected.  Asparagus wrapped in prosciutto and phylo dough, stuffed portebello wedges and grilled veggie skewers... That alone would have been enough! The bellinis were refreshing and the farfalle pasta with duck confit and asparagus was mouth-watering.  I will certainly be back to try the weeknight buffet!

2007-05-24,4.0,"So I am giving this four stars, but I am much more in the 3.5 star range (I have a tendency to over-reach) I have a weekly tradition while I am in Chicago for the summer to go out to a different restaurant in the vicinity of my job.  Today I opted for something directly downstairs...Trattoria #10.  The ambiance left much to be desired.  Because I was dining alone I was sort of placed in a strange corner of the restaurant (still surrounded by other tables mind you), but everything was kind of off kilter.  My waitress was quite nice, but definitely seemed out of place if they are trying to break into the finer dining establishment scene.  Plates took longer than expected to be cleared and other elements of fine-tuned service were lacking.   There was little if any art on the walls and because this restaurant is located below ground it felt kind of cramped and depressing. The food however saved this from being truly ordinary.  I started with a Pinot Bianco and the Grilled Calamari with hearts of palm, fresh mozzarella, haricots vert and cherry tomatoes.  The calamari was perfectly seasoned and the hearts of palm and mozzarella were refreshing.  I think they could completely do away with the last two additions because they complicated the dish.  My crisp and relatively dry Pinot Bianco matched quite well and I let it lead me into the main dish. For my Secondi I ordered the Grilled Sea Scallops, served aside sauted spinach and porcini mushrooms.  This was also bordering on quite delicious were it not for a couple of hiccups.  First, I felt the meaty porcini, although wonderful, competed with the delicate scallop.  I also felt my scallop could have been more grilled.  It was almost as if their ""grill"" was not hot enough to quickly sear the scallop and leave it wonderful and moist inside.  I appreciate however that they did not overdo it and leave me with tough rubber.  The sauce served underneath was almost a buerre blanc and a bit overpowering as well.   I think my expectations may have been a little high, but overall this is a decent place to take clients (it was full of business folk and lawyer wannabes (me)) for a decent meal in the loop.",0.9938,0.828,0.141,0.031,0.5635772357723577
2007-05-01,5.0,"One of my favorite business lunch spots in the city -- it has it all: great food, great service, and quiet 'acoustics' at the tables -- i.e., you can have good conversations without screaming at each other, or without having to 'low talk' to avoid being overheard. Most recently, we enjoyed the recent plethora of duck on the menu...I'm not normally a duck guy, but it was fantastic. I also had a tenderloin pasta that was phenomenal. Oh! And most recently, an orechiette with sausage -- can't get enough, Their ravioli is the 'signature item,' I would say, and you can't go wrong there, either. I also love their caesar salad...something special about the 'light' nature of it...not smothered like most restaurants. I could list all of their entrees, but you must check it out for yourself. I haven't ever been there for dinner (we tend to go to 312 or Bin 36 for our pre-show dinner...something about numbers in the Loop, apparently), but will certainly make it there at some point.",0.9865,0.773,0.2,0.027,0.5674430641821946
2007-03-02,4.0,"My latest edition of Good Deal Meals: the weeknight buffet (5:30 to 7:30) at Trattoria 10.  For $12 per person (with a one-drink minimum) you can help yourself to a spread of salads, antipasti, pastas and fruit.  This worked well for us because we were going to the theatre and didn't want to carry any aromatic bags of leftovers around.  The staff was very helpful in finding us a table (we arrived at 6:20 and it was pretty full) and they did a fairly good job replenishing the empty trays.  Only minus: I would have liked a salt and pepper shaker, maybe some olive oil, on the table, because the food was a little on the bland side. We decided to order dessert off the menu, and got the ""Chocolate Trio"" for another $12.  It was enough for four of us to share, and it was positively scrumptious.  I also thought the bathrooms were nice.",0.9802,0.797,0.185,0.018,0.6485858585858585
