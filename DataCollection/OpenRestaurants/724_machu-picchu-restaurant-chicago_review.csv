On Mondays you get 2 entrees and 1 appetizer from their select menu for $25! The portions are super generous and all of the options are amazing! They also have an outdoor patio during the summer.

Service was great! Staff were nice and diligent. We were served with complimentary bread and ahi which took me by surprise on how delicious it was. The bread was out of the oven, and the sauce was definitely on the spicy side that some weren't able to handle but I liked it. The Lomo Saltado and Yuquita Rellenas were mouth watering!

The chicken itself was seasoned well and again had good flavor but it was incredibly dry. Same with my husband's food, he had the churrasco and it was too well-done.

My initial take was it was very good but a bit heavy on the salt. We like savoriness but it seemed that it was ramped up a bit too much. The over use of salt didn't detract that much though from what we thought was a great meal! The service was great and the bread they serve before the meal was outstanding!

2016-11-28,4.0,"To say this meal was a deleterious intake of carbs is exaggerating, but needless to say, postprandial somnolence was an involuntary given.  Monday nights at Machu Picchu are outrageously affordable and muffled. Dinner for two is $25 with a shared appetizer and one entree per person. For our party of five, we ordered two dinner sets and added on a few more items. Our mouths were busy chewing the whole night. For appetizers, we had the fried yucca with cheese, chicken tamale, and empanadas. Our favorite item was the fried yucca balls with cheese as its center filling. Without being excessive, a small bowl of hot, melted cheese was ready for you to dip. It was very light despite the carbs and dairy. The tamale was at least six inches long and two inches wide. Itself can be a meal. The empanadas came in beef and chicken. I was not particularly fond of them. The crust was a bit dull and the meat wasn't particularly flavorful.  For entrees, we also tried a variety of items. The cuisine doesn't seem to stick to one particular theme but instead is very diverse and absorbent of other cuisines. For example, the linguine in pesto has an Italian influence. Simply with spinach, basil, fresco cheese, and sauteed mushrooms, this was by far one of our most favorite items of the evening. A slight alteration to that dish is the tallarin verde. Two huge juicy slabs of skirt steak sat upon a heap of linguine in pesto. For something even more different, the lomo saltado and aji de gallina is also worthy of trying. The lomo saltado has strips of top sirloin stir fried with onions, tomatoes, and French fries. I found this dish very appealing and Hawaiian. The contents were cooked in a flaming pan and the meat had a very nice char to it. The aji de gallina resembles an extremely mild curry dish with shredded chicken. The difference is the cream sauce which is made with ground walnuts, milk, and parmesan cheese.  The portions are incredibly generous and each of us took half of our entrees to go. If you're looking for an economical, speak-easy, intimate date night, Machu Picchu should be part of your consideration.",0.9794,0.881,0.091,0.028,0.580124458874459

My feet did thaw relatively quickly inside Machu Picchu though! We arrived at 10:30pm on a Saturday night only to find that the restaurant was not even halfway full, which made me slightly skeptical. However, we didn't care at that point, so we proceeded to get seated immediately. It's BYOB, which is nice since we had a bottle with us that we planned on using at Tango Sur. We started off with bread and side of dipping sauce made of jalapeños, garlic, and a few other ingredients. The sauce was SPICY. I'm talking a kick that lingers in your mouth for a very long time, so a little goes a long way. Eat at your own risk. The bread and sauce were my favorites. You can tell that the bread was fresh. I ordered the Churrasco a lo Pobre at $22. Price point isn't bad for a steakhouse. It was a top sirloin steak served with french fries, white rice, plantains, and fried eggs. Everything BUT the steak was great. The steak tasted like charred meat without seasoning. I had to add salt, pepper, and the spicy sauce to make it somewhat enjoyable. The service was somewhat lacking. There was pretty much one server in charge of the whole restaurant, and a lot of his time was spent behind the bar reconciling the night's receipts. I hope everything reconciled. If the steak can't be cooked properly at a steakhouse, I would say try other options.

The servers are great, and always have wonderful recommendations on what to order if you are unsure or on the fence.     And a bit more on the great service:  Last time me and my boyfriend had dinner here, a few days ago, there was a Cubs night game going on so finding parking for our gigantic truck was a bit of a challenge. Finally my boyfriend said whatever we'll just park here in this permit only parking; we won't be in too long, and the food is worth it.  Dinner was amazing as always, but when we walked out to the truck after dinner there it was- a ugly bright orange parking ticket on out windshield. (Totally our fault)...Well the owner or manager was in his car behind us and seen that we were ticketed. He asked how much the ticket was, and offered us free dinner next time we come in, to help cover some of the cost of the ticket.

Only 1 star taken off for slow service, they were surprisingly busy for a Monday night and I think they were a bit understaffed. We had to wait probably over 30 minutes for our entrees but they sent over a plate of calamari on the house which was a nice gesture.  The food is so great! We got papa rellena (good for those slightly less adventurous), pancita (really tender, a bit too charred for my taste though), and ceviche mar adentro (on point, the seafood was delicious and the peruvian corn a nice touch) for our appetizers.  Everyone enjoyed their entrees, I personally got the lamb shank and was so happy. The meat fell right off the bone and the rice and beans served with the dish were out of this world. I may actually have liked the flavor of the rice and beans more than anything. I would definitely come back here, it was a pretty good spot for a party of six.",0.9959,0.74,0.26,0.0,0.6250992063492063
2016-07-08,4.0,"3.5/5 stars Super authentic vibes, but the food was a little lackluster. That being said, a good experience overall.  The lighting was very dim, which was a minor annoyance throughout the evening. Our waiter was wonderful and explained to us what all the dishes were, since the menu is not quite descriptive enough. Also, we stayed about half an hour past the restaurant's closing and the service just waited patiently, so thanks/sorry for that. We started off with their take on rolls and butter/olive oil - bread with this amazing jalapeno-avocado sauce. They say the best things in life are free and I could not agree more; this sauce was bomb. I came here with a group of 12 other people, so we ordered multiple dishes and shared them.  Some of the appetizers we had were pretty decent; the chicken skewers were juicy and well-seasoned and calamari is deep-fried so its good by default. However, the Choclo con Queso was really starchy and basuc. Peruvian corn has ENORMOUS kernels and it's definitely worth seeing, but the taste is nothing special. Also the Papa a la Hunacaina was pretty lame; it was literally just plain boiled potatoes and a pretty lame cheese sauce.  We ordered some Passion Fruit juice and a pitcher of Chicha Morada. The passion fruit juice is amazing and fresh and the acid really helps you with the rich meal. Chicha Morada was really interesting, but it's definitely more of an Autumn flavor.  Dinner choices across the table were either the Parrilla para 2 or the Seco de Cordero.  The parrilla is basically a ton of meat brought to you on a still-burning stove. The short ribs were a bit burnt/bitter for my taste and the beef heart was really tough and chewy. However, the top sirloin was pretty good. The Seco de Cordero (lamb shank) on the other hand was AMAZING. Absolutely melted in my mouth and was so flavorful.   Last, we ordered passion fruit creme brulee and flan; both were delicious.  Final thoughts: I want to like this place more bc the dishes they do well are lovely, but it's really hit or miss. This is the kind of restaurant where I would have liked to have done my research on the menu beforehand. Choose wisely.",0.999,0.666,0.283,0.051,0.6014824797843664

The 3rd time, I actually forgot to take my credit card back then soon I received a 2nd notification from my phone about a 2nd charge to my card. I drove back to fetch my card then they realized they charged my card a 2nd time for another party. It's not all their faults since I did forget to take my credit card back. However, I saw a mess at the counter. All cards and receipts were mixed. The 4th experience was really bad. Let's start with a complaint of the restaurant was way too dark. We were seating in the middle of the restaurant. The can lights were only around the room. It's so hard for us to read the menus. One of my guests needed to use her phone screen to light up her menu. We ordered some sodas and were delivered to use quickly. The problems started from my friend ordered more. His orders didn't come till we asked. That was about 30 minutes later. We then ordered appetizers and entrées. Nothing was delivered to us at least 40 minutes. We couldn't even find our waiter. We had to ask other waiters to help. They came back with a question, ""Did you guys order appetizers?"" Finally, our waiter showed up and opened his order booklet. A paper had all mess up orders from all his customers was shown to me. He finally found out our orders.  Later, we got our food but a side that my friend ordered had never showed up. BTW, we finally got our soda. By the end of the story, the waiter brought us the receipt. The missing side was in the list too. Since we had more than 6 adults, there was a 18% service fee. It's really a shameless way to ask 18% service fee. We called up the waiter again, told him the missing food and what a service we received not worth of 18% service fee. He then removed the missing food and the service fee also gave us 2 $10 coupons. We ended up gave them 5% tips and do not think will use the coupons.",-0.8535,0.879,0.045,0.076,0.28461538461538466

A lot of people in our group got tallaren verde which was steak on top of pesto linguini.

I had to hijack my husband's water and 2 of my friends shared their water with me because you could even get a water refill.  All that said, I don't blame the servers or the kitchen, I blame the restaurant management. If you know you have a large party coming on Saturday night, perhaps additional staff is required. The food was 5star, everything else I am on the fence .",0.9905,0.797,0.203,0.0,0.6726499690785406
2015-09-18,5.0,"Really like this gem. Their seafood and rice dishes are the best to me. In particular the Arroz con Pollo (cilantro makes the rice green instead of your traditional yellow), seafood paella, and seafood platter are the best. Dishes are bursting with flavor, very bright and citrus-y. I also have had the fried whole fish. The meat of the fish was really nice, but it can be tricky to eat. The meat/steak dishes are not bad, but nothing special so I'd go with what the seem more known for. My biggest complaint for the place is the dim lighting. If you're not sitting by a window then it can actually be hard to see what you're eating - particularly difficult if you're eating fish with lots of small bones. Overall though really nice change-of-pace place.",0.7413,0.789,0.126,0.085,0.49815476190476193
2015-09-03,5.0,"Great food, and equally great service! Been here twice, and it's now one of my favorite restaurants on north side. PLACE: Came here on a Saturday night in a group of four, wine bottles in hand. They surprisingly seated us immediately, and Vanessa offered lots of information about their menu - she's the owner's wife, and is now on my top list of best customer service ever received. The food took longer than we wanted, but it was totally worth the wait! I also noticed there were large group happening around us, so this would be a great option for that type of thing. Machu Picchu has a strong date-night feel: tablecloths and candles, moody-setting dim lighting, and music that's not too loud. But you can still bring kids along, very family friendly! FOOD: The bread they serve up for free is amazing- fluffy, a little sweet, and highly addictive. I got the Bistec a lo Pobre. The combination of the steak, fried eggs, fried plantains, and perfectly cooked/seasoned steamed rice truly hit the spot for me. In the end, it was hard to say no to the desserts, but the entree portions were so generous I didn't have any room!

2015-06-29,4.0,"Oh wow, I finally came to this location for Peruvian cuisine and we lucked out as the temps were in the 70's and we were able to sit outside. Let me just say I was impressed. Of course the prices may be a little up there but I have been to quite a few Peruvian restaurants in Chicago and this is definitely up there in taste. The waiter was very pleasant when it came to explaining their food items and he took the time to tell us that if we wanted BYOB that one of the other waiters would be more then happy to go to the corner and bring us some libations back, of course we didn't want to inconvenience him so we declined and of course we would of tipped him well for that gesture, but at this point we felt that we could do without.  I had the Churraso a la pobre, which easily translates to steak for the poor, although it wasn't for the poor with price, it still was fair and quite tasty. I wanted my steak medium rare and the cook did it to perfection. The fries that came along with it were really nice (see photos) and the rice with two eggs on top topped it off as a dish fit for a five star restaurant. Who can deny the taste of this perfectly seasoned steak and the size was bedrock of the Flintstones size, I could only eat 1/3 of it, as it was really thick and big. The rice was perfect and the eggs that drizzled its yolk onto my meat and rice gave it the perfect compliment.  Now for dessert I had the rice pudding and ouch! The reason I say that is because I am use to cold puddings and I scooped up a portion and shoved it in my mouth but until it was too late I realized I just scolded my mouth because it was hot. I guess I didn't realize the in Peru the rice pudding is served scolding hot! OUCH! But oh boy was it good. We also had another dessert made of passion fruit with a nice and crispy top, again good.  All in all I highly recommend this restaurant for the mere fact that it is totally different from other Latin restaurants as far as taste and circuses. I will be back.  And don't forget to check in with your YELP app, as it gave me 20% off the total order for a party of four, and it was well worth it.",0.9981,0.769,0.205,0.026,0.6296124031007754

Although it doesn't make my Top 5 All-Time Peruvian restaurant in the US, I do have to say this place is still really good.  Appetizers: *  Choclo con Queso- (peruvian corn with fresco cheese served with huancaina sauce). This app is amazing! Its so simple but the flavors are a unique and wonderful blend. Very authentic- I highly recommend. My boyfriend (from Peru) said he used to eat this as a snack as a little one. Isn't difficult to replicate- just essential to find the big corn! *  Papa a la Huancaina- (bolied potatoes topped with an aji amarillo cheese sauce). Lightly fried and filled with yumminess. This delicate app is one of my favorite dishes. Main Entree: *  Bistec a lo Pobre- (steak served with fried eggs, fries, plantains and rice). The steak was a bit overdone and bland but in combo with the fried egg + rice= yummy. The french fries were also very delish!- nice and crispy! Drink: *  Chicha Morada- (purple corn juice with fruits and cinnamon) *  BYOB Overall thoughts: The blandness of the flank steak was disappointing- especially when the appetizers were so spot on! But that doesn't deter me from coming back here again. I will probably try the ceviche and seafood next time, however. This restaurant is a bit more upscale than The Taste of Peru or Ay Ay Picante.

The Pescado a lo Macho (fried tilapia) was lightly floured and pan fried with a nice spiced, but not spicy broth. The Sudado de Mariscos (crab, mussels, scallop, shrimp, calamari in a tomato base) was tasty and seemed authentic. But the Aji de Gallina (pulled chicken) was not hot (probably prepared well in advance) and reminiscent of pot pie filling. A note about décor - the tables were lovely, but there were two televisions that were on (video only, no audio) during dinner, which were distracting. There was also rather loud music, which didn't bother me, but if you're dining with quiet (or older and possibly hearing challenged) people, it's something to keep in mind. Also worth noting is their online reservation system isn't designed to tell you if there are indeed tables available.

2013-11-15,4.0,"This relatively unassuming spot along Ashland, more a neighborhood place than anything, will draw me back time after time for keeping things simple and to the point. That simple point being Flavor. Machu Picchu brings it in all sorts of ways.  After the last time dining here, I realized that everything we had was delicious and memorable for being packed with so many different flavors that I ended up forgetting the type of meat I was eating with the Seco de Cordero (lamb shank), or what kind of seafood was in the Arroz con Mariscos (mussels, shrimp, crab leg, squid). But the flavors aren't muddled or confusing.  Each dish tasted unique.  Each dish offered different tastes and spice levels, but were equally delicious.  I had an impossible time choosing a favorite in the evening. As mentioned, the Seco de Cordero (lamb shank served over slow cooked beans and rice and smothered in this outrageously rich, delicious and slightly spicy reduction sauce), and the Arroz con Mariscos (kind of like Peruvian-style paella, but no sausage- only seafood) were fantastic, and the two potato dishes we shared were great as well.  It's Peruvian food- you have to order up some potatoes! The papas a la huancaina are better than your mama's potato salad - but that's probably the best way for me to describe it in some (terrible) short marketing quip.  Large peeled white potatoes cooked down and smothered in this yellow sauce that is both creamy and salty.  Topped with hard-boiled eggs, this is straight forward and yet satisfying.  The huancaina sauce and its almost cheesiness is the real star to this dish.  I could eat multiple pounds of this stuff in one sitting. The papas rellenos is the love child of a messy orgy between a batch of shepherds pie, a Japanese style potato croquette, and some onions that passed out inside a pickle jar for a couple of days.  A fiendishly and amazingly simple concept that makes you think it should be something to attempt to make at home, until you realize the amount of work you would need to put in to making it, and how cheap it is on offer here.  Just come here for it.  You won't be able to replicate how good it is at home anyway.  Mashed potatoes stuffed with sauteed ground meat (beef?) that is shaped like a rugby ball and then deep fried before being served with some pickled onions.  You're welcome. *Insider note- bring a bottle of your favorite pisco, and ask the servers to make a big batch of pisco sour.  They're really, really good at it - I promise! And all this flavor brings me back to the beginning.  After being seated they drop off this little basket of bread and this yellow salsa.  That salsa is murder-worthy.  I'd do unspeakable harm to an unsuspecting and undeserving person in order to replicate that stuff.  That little basket of bread and salsa is worth the trip by itself- which is why I was happy that our dinner partners were a few minutes late.  I think I polished off two full baskets of bread and undeniably perfect salsa by myself. *That insider tip was brought to you by my favorite honorary Peruvian- Nishan P.  Gracias mi amigo.",0.9981,0.788,0.172,0.04,0.533826164874552
2013-11-11,3.0,"Peruvian cuisine, and its byob, so don't forget your wine or beer of choice. I have the Arroz con Mariscos - a Peruvian version of Paella, with seafood. Everything was dry. The rice was dry and reminded me of the ""combo fried rice"" at the corner Chinese take out spot growing up in the midwest. The clams were dry. The mussels were dry. The calamari was dry. The lobster was a nice topping for presentation and was actually a delicious tidbit amongst this plate. It was either overcooked or left in the window too long - I don't know which and it doesn't really matter - I doubt I'll be back. Not worth the effort. My friend had the chicken and shrimp special which looked juicy and tender and his plate looked licked clean after our meal, so I assume his dish was amazing.

2013-10-23,4.0,"I lived in Peru for almost 2 years, and eating dinner there last weekend really brought back some memories!  I couldn't think of any traditional dishes that I've been missing from Peru that aren't on their menu, besides cuy (guinea pig), which probably wouldn't sell very well in Chicago anyway. My boyfriend and I split the anticuchos and papa rellena appetizers.  The anticuchos were a lot like how I remember them straight off a street cart!  The papa rellena was different, though--less greasy, which most people would probably consider a good thing, but I was craving the authentic, artery clogging street food I remembered.  Still, it was very, very good--I'd recommend trying both.  I ordered the anticuchos without telling my boyfriend that they are actually cow heart--he liked them enough that he didn't kill me when I told him afterwards what he'd just eaten :)  They taste like steak! For entrees, I had the ceviche de sole and my boyfriend had the lomo saltado.  The sauce on the ceviche was spot on--just a little spicy, plenty of lime.  Yum!  And I was thrilled that it came with choclo (giant corn kernals).  Love them!  My boyfriend's lomo saltado was tender and seasoned perfectly. There are 2 things Peruvian, though, that I wish were on the menu.  The hot sauce that came with the bread (and that I also put on my anticuchos and papa rellena) was very good, but unfamiliar--there are a million varieties of hot sauce even within Peru, though, and I don't consider myself an expert.  But if I can ever figure out what pepper was commonly used in the Peruvian hot sauce I tasted, I'd love to find it in Chicago somewhere.  This wasn't quite it.  The second is purple sweet potatoes--I love them and don't know where to find them, but they would be amazing with the ceviche. Overall, though, I had a great experience and am really looking forward to working my way through the menu!",0.9977,0.784,0.208,0.009,0.5250925925925924

After I parked, I could not believe how easy it was, and how awesome of a spot I had, because I stared at my car for about an extra 10 min.  For starters, you must try the Choclo con Queso. Peruvian corn (giant, delicious kernels), and cheese that you can dip in a Huancaina sauce. They also have bread and a spicy, green sauce you can dip in. Hands down one of the best sauces I've ever tasted (I'm a huge spice fan) I'm a huge egg person, love eggs on everything, so I either always get the Bistec A Lo Pobre, or the Churrasco A Lo Pobre (the difference is the kind of meat quality, but the sides are the same).

Parking wasn't terrible and the wait wasn't long at all; BYOB just like everyone says and it was nice to be offered assistance with opening wine or beers that weren't twist off. Not the fanciest restaurant and a smaller place with one room and about twenty or so tables - tonight had many birthday parties (we heard the song at least three times that night) so it was packed. Ordered the Ceviche de Pescado for an appetizer and dinner (mine: Lomo Fino Machu Picchu; his: Aji de Gallina). Got the ceviche fairly quickly (~10 minutes) and it was DELICIOUS. I hate red onions and it was covered in it, but I almost chose to ignore this fact as it was THAT good. And SPICY to boot. For that alone, I could consider coming back. But I likely won't. The food took forever to come out. When we walked in, we walked in with two other women and the table immediately to the left of the entrance was already seated and having beverages. Our order came out before the two women AND the group that was already seated. We ordered at about 9:40; didn't get our entrees until about 10:30. And honestly, it was not even great steak - the filet mignon was, for the most part, cooked medium (my specification) and yet, the meat was just not good. It tasted almost like it had experienced freezer burn right before being thrown onto the grill. As disappointing as it is to say, I always finish my steaks... with the exception of tonight. His meal didn't even make sense to me - it was like looking at yellow curry chicken, but tasting kind of like pureed sweetness... on chicken and rice.

I realize not everyone is blessed with a friend from Peru, so I shall be your Peruvian friend* and tell you exactly what to get. Start with the Papa a la Huancaina. This traditional dish from the Peruvian highlands features potatoes topped with a mild yellow pepper and cheese sauce. It's served with boiled eggs and olives. Add a Tamal Peruano. Very different from Mexican tamales, the Peruvian version is ground maize filled with pork, olives and peanuts wrapped in a banana leaf. The strong flavor of the marinated onion salad accompanying it well complements the tamale.  For the main course, get the Seco de Cordero. Another traditional highland dish, this baby lamb leg stew is cooked with Peruvian red pepper, cilantro and beer. Served with beans and rice, it's hearty, savory, and a little spicy. If still hungry or sharing your meal, order the Lomo Saltado. This dish consists of top sirloin steak strips sautéed with onions, French fries and tomatoes.  Before visiting Machu Picchu, be sure to pick up a bottle Pisco. For a nominal $10 fee, the restaurant will mix up a pitcher of Pisco Sour for you. If alcoholic beverages are not your thing, try the Chicha Morada. A purple drink made of corn and spiced with cloves and cinnamon, it's not only tasty but reputed to have various therapeutic properties. I feel I lowered my cholesterol with just one glass.

Being BYOB our party of 30+ brought anything from red wine and sangria, to 1738 and beer. With so much liquor and a huge party at times we got louder than acceptable in a restaurant but Machu let us party on. With such a party we were split into two.

The ceviche mixto (Ceviche Mixto - Variety of seafood marinated in lime juice, cilantro and Peruvian Rocoto chilies. Accompanied by lettuce, potatoes, sweet potatoes, finely sliced onions and Peruvian corn) is for all you lime and seafood lovers, the additional potato and sweet potato was unnecessary. The calamari (Chicharron de Calamar - Fried calamari served with Salsa Criolla (marinated onion salad), corn and fried yucca) had a delicious breading on it and came with a side of slice onion garnish that accompanied it very well.

The sirloin was well seasoned and who doesn't love friend plantains? The serving size was big enough to easily feed 2.  I also tried a friend's dish that came with mash potatoes and OH-EM-GEE, when people talk about foodgasm this is it. It was delicious so good I kept picking off of my friend. Seriously people try it and if you don't like it well I really don't know what to tell ya.  Heard good things from everyone at the table about their dish, only big issue is the birthday girl's dinner never came out, we had to remind our server. Everyone at our table just about finished when her red snapper finally arrived by than everyone was having a good time so we didn't make it into an issue, but it's just unfortunate it had to be hers, however, the great flavor of the red snapper did make up for it, yum. Also those extra side things you serve with some dishes like the salad, it is better off it's separated from the meat vs serving the meat over it, just a suggestion. Overall, we got good service, the rolling out of dishes was a bit slow and needs better communication, but it's expected with such a large party, the food was well received and our bill for one table was quite expensive for a BYOB restaurant, but it's all good and fun when you're celebrating a friend's big 30th!",0.9985,0.732,0.214,0.054,0.5276785714285716

I had the Bife Ancho or commonly known as the ribeye. The steak was prepared perfectly: tender & filled with flavor. Our appetizers were the calamari & the fried mashed potatoes,  both were awesome!  Did I mention that the fried mashed potato is totally a party in your mouth!?!  The chicken special with shrimp in garlic sauce, was also a great option filled with tons of fun. However, the sides were authentic but left me wishing there were other options. I also felt that some of food lacked sauce.  All & all,  machu Picchu was a good experience. The service was good, the food was good, & the ambiance was good. However, it may not have been the best setting for our rambunctious group.

If you can't handle spicy this sauce may not be your cup of tea. The anticuchos (grilled beef heart) was effin' tasty!

We polished that off quickly and I was more than anxious for my entree. At the waiter and my friends recommendation, I got the Arroz con Mariscos, which is basically seafood paella and it was amazing. So flavorful and loaded with seafood, huge clams, mussels and even a crab leg. Yes, you have to crack it, and yes, I made a large mess. My friend got the red snapper special too and that was also really tasty, just watch out for the bones. The restaurant is no frills but it's BYOB and has great food. The only damper on our time was the wait staff was a bit short and rude to us and the initial yucca was cold and when they brought out another plate, there was a half order given to us. Not a huge stain on our time but a little surprising. Either way, I would go back and bring one less bottle of wine with me.

Friend's birthday party was originally planned at Tango Sur.  Party shows up and come to find out our reservation was canceled earlier in the week, unbeknownst to the organizer.  So where is a party of 18, yep, eighteen people going to go last minute, 7:00PM on a Saturday, that is BYOB without corkage considering the plethora of bottles on hand, and allowed us to serve our own birthday cake. Made a call to Machu Picchu and they were able to accommodate us right away! OMFG, are you for serious?  Took the short drive from Southport to Ashland, walked in and our table was ready!  For this fact alone, we are so grateful and it saved the night! Great atmosphere, not necessarily the physicality of the space (although can be a conversion in itself), but lots of other parties there that night having a great time.  Service was quick for 18 people, food came out great, hearty portions & delicious!  Minor details can be easily overlooked given their accommodation but overall, had a fun time with old & new friends over wine & yummy food!

The service was good, but a little strange.  They kept trying to take our order before our whole party was there (and then again as soon as the last person walked in, before she'd even opened a menu).  The only thing that annoyed me was that they kept trying to take away the little plate that I'd saved from the bread that I was putting shells on.  Which, when you're eating crab and mussels (and shrimps with tails still attached), is kind of important - was I supposed to put these things on the table?  Yet no less than 3 different servers tried to remove it, even as I was physically putting something on it.  Weird.  It just seemed a little over-eager and overbearing.

By the time we were finishing up it started to get quite filled up so glad we got a table early on. First item was a horrible experience...the bread with some VERY HOT dipping sauce. Don't like hot at all so took awhile to get that out of my mouth. They should probably warn people about this stuff, I thought it was maybe some type of garlic oil, but it's definitely not for lightweights. It got way better soon thereafter. Appetizer-wise we had the chicken salad in avocado....good, tasty, plenty for 2, in fact took half to go as not to fill up on it. For entree I had the shrimp in garlic sauce (camarones ajo, or something like that). Really good, shrimp in a nice rich red  sauce swirled with a buttery garlic white sauce. Really tasty. The molded rice had a nice flavor (probably butter). My friend had the whole snapper, which was crispy and fresh tasting, as good as I have had in any Latin country.  BYOB is a nice feature, really saves on the final bill, Skipped dessert, as was full and nothing sounded that outstanding. Really my only criticism is that the place is super dark, which I do like darker restaurants, but this was a bit too dark. The music was actually nice too, really mellow Latin, not sure if it was Peruvian or not. Way too often I find music selections when dining out to be really annoying or haphazardly chosen.

I'd heard great things about this restaurant and was super excited to try it and even more happy when I found out they are BYOB. I arrive and there is a table ready and waiting for us. They already have some menus out and they instinctively take the white wines from us and put them in chilled buckets. Our waters were constantly filled and they were also able to recommend some dishes. I wanted so badly to go with the bacon wrapped filet mignon or some other cut of steak, but my father had chastised me about not ordering authentic dishes when I go to ethnic restaurants. Instead, I ordered the Peruvian style paella and I'm glad I took dad's advice. It's filled with seafood and every bite was delicious, even the next day. But I did have to watch out for rogue seashell - ouch! My order was perfect; however, another reason I'm glad I didn't order the steak is that everyone at our table who did had their cuts overdone. The waiter was very apologetic and offered to replace all of the steak orders, but we had already been there close to an hour and people were hungry. No one sent their meal back, but at least the offer was there to have the mistake corrected. I suggest ordering rarer and having them cook it a bit more if it's wrong than having them overdo it and requiring to eat what you have or having them start from scratch. Despite this hiccup, I think everyone liked what they had and the fried Red Snapper looked amazing. We played with the fish head and the waiter took pictures for us.

The mixed seafood was delicious with calamari, scallops and shrimp.  For our entrees- my friend had the fish special of the day and I went with a house specialty which was like paella, robust with seafood, a huge portion and also delicious! The fish special was a red snapper that had been deep fried with head and tail intact (made a beautiful presentation) although my friend was taken aback that it needed to be de boned. But that turned out not to be an issue and the fish was beautifully prepared and served on a bed of mixed seafood (calamari, scallops, etc)  Our wine was promptly opened and our glasses were quickly refilled. The service was attentive, and the darkness in the place lent an air of intimacy that really isn't there.  The best news?

We drive by it all the time but this time we were hungry, had the night free, and the stars were aligned. My boyfriend has been watching an excessive amount of these documentaries and docu-series about aliens lately. For some reason a lot of extraterrestrial activity is believed to have occurred in Peru, and Machu Picchu is central to this activity. So when we drove by, we both looked at the sign, and I said, ""I've always wanted to try that place. Wanna just eat here?"" And he replied with an enthusiastic ""YES."" Later during our meal, he admitted that it was in part because of all the alien-centric TV he has been watching. So I have these ET enthusiasts to thank for our visit to what is now one of my favorite restaurants in Lakeview. We walked in, and immediately knew it was our type of place. We're all about the BYOB so we had our wine ready and they popped it open for us right away. We sat right next to the huge mural of Machu Picchu on the far wall. The tables are a little close together, but it didn't bother me at all throughout our time there.

We ordered the seafood ceviche, fried red snapper and steak.  The ceviche was okay. It was a lot. Ceviche consisted of fish, shrimp, calamari and on the side sweet potato and a steamed potato and giant corn kernels. The ceviche was spicy and the fish didn't taste fresh. Kind of disappointing and it cost 16 bucks. Red snapper was what my boyfriend ordered. It came with rice and salad. It was fried to perfection, skin was crispy. It was the whole fish and it was very good. Worth the money. I ordered a steak dinner, it came with A LOT of food. 3 pieces of steak, rice, french fries and plantains. WOW, the steak was so flavorful. It was marinated really well. The french fries were also very good, crispy and seemed breaded almost. Fried bananas, you can't go wrong. I think my dish was definitely worth the money. It was a lot of food that I couldn't finish regardless of how hungry I was. Our bill with tax and tip was $60. It was a lot of food and well worth it.

We also realized we were given potatoes and not the yucca we had ordered. Once again the place was still empty yet our waiter was no where to be found. I had to grab new silverware from a close by empty table. He eventually came back and we were brought the yucca. This was the only good thing we were given to eat that evening.  My wife ordered fish that smelled horrific across the table. She felt nauseous while eating it and needed pepto as soon as we arrived home.

2011-04-05,2.0,"On Machu Piccu website they said  they have the ""best authentic peruvian cuisine in the city of Chicago"" but I'm not sure if if I agree. It seems like their specialty were steaks since majority of the menu included different variation of steak with some type of vegetable or carbohydrate on the side. I am a huge fan of Filet Mignon, so I decided to give this place a try.  I had the Lomo Fino Machu Picchu. The Lomo Fino Machu PIcchu is filet mignon cooked on the grill and served with diced potatoes and steamed vegetables. When I got the plate, I was mildly disappointed on the preparation and the presentation with the price I was paying. I've had eaten a quite a few types of steak and filet mignon at different range of establishment. I felt like the steak was slightly overcooked when I asked for a medium, the cut of the meat was a bit fatty for filet mignon, and the filet did not preserve the flavor and tenderness you get when you bite into it. I was disappointed. In addition, I felt their presentation of the side dishes were a little sloppy. However their diced potatoes and vegetables didn't taste too bad.  I was with a huge group, and the consensus I get is disappointment as well. I think one thing that really bothers me at restaurants is when the description of the plate doesn't match with what's presented in the plate. For example, when you say the steak comes with mashed potatoes and a side salad. You shouldn't expect the salad to be a huge piece of lettuce with a slice of tomato from a sandwich.  Maybe I'm being a little picky but I honestly believe this place is one of those places where they jack up the prices for the hell of it since some folks are willing to pay that kind of money. The interior was very clean, darkly-lit. I couldn't see too much of it because it was pretty dark and maybe it was dark because they were trying to hide something (just kidding).

The lobster was old and over cooked.  arroz con mariscos - ok, the rice was overdone, and there was not much seafood involved. huachinango frito - ok, the fish was over fried and not fresh. estofado de carne - supposed to be beef stew, and was not good at all. the stew was one of the worst red wine stew i've had. we were quite disheartened by the meal at the end, it was so bad that we didn't finish our food, and opted to go for frozen custard instead. i really can't think of anything good to say about this restaurant.",-0.973,0.831,0.065,0.105,0.4327988295229675

We ordered our yucca appetizer, and asked to order our main courses as well, since who knew how long it would take if we didn't. He recommended the Estofado de Pollo when I asked for his suggestions, which was helpful. We saw him once throughout the rest of the meal. The place definitely filled up quite a bit while we sat there, and he checked to see if we liked the food, and that was it. When we were done with our mains, we waited, and waited, and waited to either be asked if we wanted dessert or the check and got absolutely no acknowledgment. He would walk by our table as if we didn't exist - no exaggeration. In fact, everyone seemed to not see us. And everyone seemed streeeeessed out. I don't know what was going on, but they did not seem very relaxed at all. Except for the few times we saw our server standing by the kitchen with a look of utter boredom. It should also be noted that another couple nearby was seated after us and in the time we were served and finished our meal they had gotten their wine served to them, had ordered, eaten both appetizers and main courses, and even finished their dessert. They of course paid and left before we could even get our server's attention to get our check.  We didn't want to tip, but karmically had to leave something, and I wanted to say something to the host. But as we were putting our coats on a party of probably 25-30 people started arriving and all of his attention was spent on them. The food was enough to get us to go back, but the service has guaranteed we won't. We're not demanding diners, and wish them well, but they really need to get their act together regarding service. We understand if you're busy or are having an off night, but at least acknowledge that there's an issue so we can all be on the same page about it.",0.8899,0.903,0.057,0.04,0.4180158730158731

2010-10-04,4.0,"Went here for a birthday this past Friday night. I am very cautious when it comes to trying new kinds of food so when i heard peruvian i did my research before venturing out. Thank you, yelpers- i don't think i would have survived this experience without  you.  Reservation for 10 people at 8 pm- no problem. You wouldn't know what you were walking into from the outside, and even from the inside! very very dark inside, a few at our table had to pull out cellular devices to read the menu- but personally, I liked how dimly lit it was. I think it set a nice mood. The walls are pretty sparse when it comes to decorations, a few big photos of the Peruvian mountains, one of which features an alpaca which i found entertaining. almost makes you feel like you are in the mountains. Also- plentiful bread baskets with a delicious (and hot) green salsa of sorts adorn the table.  The Food- oh my gawd the food. Started with the Ceviche Mixto- per yelp suggestions- as well as the yucca. both were fabulous. The Ceviche was much more citrus-y that I was expecting it to be, but not so much that i didn't like it. so many different textures and flavors! And the Yucca! oh the yucca! i could eat this everyday. For entrees- I got the Arroz con Mariscos y Langosta (seafood paella) because i was feeling adventurous. I don't usually eat seafood (unless its raw) and i had never had paella- i was very pleased with the combination. My partner in crime got the Seco Cordero (lamb stew) because so many yelpers recommended it! Also delicious. Managed to grab a taste of the Aji de Gallina- which is what i think i will get next time i am in there. and be warned- HUGE PORTIONS! you will be bringing food home.  Service was friendly and patient and very willing to help and offer suggestions since we had never been there before. AND it was BYOB with no cork fee!!! apparently heaven is in peru.  one thing that i would have liked to know about beforehand- if you plan on splitting the bill, they will only let you split it among 3 cards. not a huge thing, just made things a little awkward since no one had cash. it turned into a ""hey you get my dinner, i'lll get your drinks later"" a $35 dinner does not equal a mix drink and 2 shots--- you know who you are.",0.9962,0.78,0.173,0.048,0.567777097902098

My hubby got a filet mignon with grilled veggies and potatoes and I got the steak milanesa with a side salad and fries. I tried the inka cola and my hubby tried the Chicha morada, both non-alcoholic drinks. Never tried these before and they were refreshing.

So, with me having the day off and my friend having come back from a month in sonoma, some readjustment to society was exactly what the doctor ordered (well, okay, ceviche is what the doctor ordered) And, as if it all came to pass, it delivered in a big way. We brought a couple of bottles of vino to cure our thirsty streak and to make the afternoon a bit brighter.  We started off splitting a plate of ceviche that had a lot of mixed seafood in it. I wasn't able to make all of them out, but some shrimp, tilapia, and squid was in there along with what looked to be another fish. The ceviche was really nice and fresh with lots of really good citrus flavors that you'd expect. I then ordered up the Pollo Saltado which was damn fine. There was a lot put on the plate, but I slowly made my way through it and the chicken had some real good spice to it and the rice was also seasoned great as well.  The service was on point the entire time and extremely friendly. The England game was about to be on, and they were more then willing to put it on and even put the Spain game on another TV as well! I did feel bad for some of the other patrons with my cheers for England taking apart Bulgaria, but when life gives you lemons, well, you know what to do.  This was a great place and very affordable.

Even before we started with some appetizers, the restaurant was getting compliments for the delightful green salsa they serve with the bread and butter.  We ended up buying a 16oz container to take home.  Our appetizers were all great: Papa a la Huancaina - Fried Yuca with a creamy dipping sauce.  A safe and easy choice since they are basically similar in flavor to French fries.  The sauce was wonderful and slightly garlicky. Papa Rellena - Potato stuffed with meat - quite tasty. Anticuchos - Beef Hearts on a Skewer.  These were awesome - literally the best beef hearts I've ever had. We got a pitcher of purple corn juice to share which had a sweet cinnamon flavor to it that slightly reminded me of horchata.

Others chose the Lomo Fino Machu Picchu, the Ceviche Mixto and the Arroz con Pollo.  All of the entrees were delicious.  We also got sides of the fried yucca which I love.

His came out, I tried them a I waited for my food, and found them to be juicy, tender, large hunks of white chicken meat, spiced very well, in a way I've never had before. The fries were good, too. I couldn't wait for my food--if they did their kids' menu this well, their adult food must be fantastic. When mine came, I was surprised to find that the dish was served cold. It was a mixed, cold seafood salad with a very, very strong lime sauce. There was shrimp (2), clams, some kind of whitefish, salmon, and some other things I can't name. I tried it--it was $14--and found it to be, overall, awful. It also came with some veggies on the side, which were dry and kind of cold, too. Probably the worst dish I've ever ordered in a restaurant. Maybe it's a Peruvian delicacy, but overall, it wasn't good.

To compare with other Peruvian restos... Rios de Sudamerica vs. M.P. - Would only pick Rios if I have picky eaters and guest who prefer a ""fancier"" (aka more expensive) meal or if I was craving a lot of pisco sours.  M.P. for everything else, especially the aji de gallina. Rosa de Lima vs. M.P. - I like both of these restos a ton, but Machu Picchu is closer so this is more convenient.  However, Rosa de Lima has the best pollo a la brasa so that wins specifically for that craving. Taste of Peru vs. M.P. - Both are very authentic. Machu Picchu stole a couple of Taste of Peru's cooks, so for originality I would go for Taste of Peru if I can make the trek up to Roger's Park. M.P. has more room than Taste, though, so if I'm with a large group then I'd choose M.P. instead.  However, Taste of Peru's Cesar makes it way cooler to hit up if you're learning more about Peru and/or planning a trip there.

We ordered the mixed ceviche as an appetizer.  For our entrees, we had the fried tilapia in a red Peruvian sauce, and the filet mignon in a yellow pepper sauce.  The ceviche was awesome!  Awesome variety of seafood, easily shareable portion, but was quite spicy.  But it was soo good that when it seemed like there were no more pieces left, i had to dig in the plate underneath all the onions to look for more seafood.  About 30 minutes after we finished the ceviche, then our entree came, maybe they only had 1 chef?  In any case, the wait was well worth it.  My tilapia was soo delicious, I had to keep eating it even though I was full!  The breading they put around the fish brought out the fish's taste and it was cooked to perfection.  And as for the filet mignon, it was juicy and tender, the sauce and seasonings used were delicious and complemented the meat so well. Overall, I would try this place again, but they need to work on their service, it just wasn't up to par.  I would recommend this place if you have nothing else planned after dinner, as you will most likely not make it.",0.9979,0.782,0.211,0.007,0.5849376114081997

I'm not familiar with Peruvian food, so I Yelped the place before hand and took a look at their website too, so I knew what to expect. I went there the first time with four other friends, some of whom had been there before.  I like the fact that it is BYOB.  Since this was my first visit, I really can't judge the food, except to say that my fillet, served with a mixed vegetable side dish was...OK, I guess. The same with the appetizers: we had mussels and a couple of potato dishes (this place is big on potatoes). All three of these were...OK, I guess. Not one of them was really very remarkable, except that one of the potato appetizers was way too salty.  Entrees were certainly enough food and nicely plated, but really nothing to get excited about. At $19, my fillet seemed reasonably priced. We ordered a couple of mixed seafood dishes and one of us had a paella.  Funny thing about the entrees: most restaurants serve everyone at the table at the same time, but it appears as if this is a convention that Manchu Picchu honors more in its breach than its observance. It seems also that the restaurant lacks plate warmers, as my entree was delivered to the table nestled on a plate that felt as if its most recent home had been a deep freeze. Sadly, the wait until my companions dinners were served was a cold and uncomfortable 10 minutes or so--way, way, way too long. Oddly enough, two of us had ordered the same thing. Why two almost identical entrees would be delivered to a table 10 minutes apart is a real puzzlement. The long delay moved our waiter enough that he graced us with a sweet smile and a promise that the rest of our dinners would be out to the table in three (yes, he said three--not a minute, not a couple of minutes, not five minutes, but three) minutes. While I didn't time him, one does have to wonder how a kitchen that can guarantee such precise timing as this has such difficulties in other areas of timing.  The room is pleasant, and it seemed like there were a good number of large parties, including a birthday party or two, in the house.  One group had a number of children.  While I like kids, they really shouldn't be allowed to run around the dining room.  The host seemed to be annoyed at one of them who seemed intent upon hijacking and dragging off the ""Please Wait to be Seated"" sign.  He finally had to practically pry it out of the little one's precious fingers before mom took note and reined the tyke in.

2009-12-16,4.0,"Wow.  Who would have thought that the space formerly known as Pepe's Tacos could produce such a fine meal?!?  I was here with a party of 8, and the table was ready and waiting at the time of our reservation.   Service was a little odd - I felt the waiter just wanted to hurry up and get the orders taken, questions were answered briskly, particularly one about whether or not a dish contained peppers (I'm mildly allergic) and was told that it didn't, when in fact it did.  However, once the food came I didn't feel like we were being rushed at all.   Appetizers - our table had the Choclo con Queso - which is the biggest ear of corn I've ever seen with a creamy sauce called huancaina (which does indeed contain peppers - fortunately my allergy is not life-threatening!).  This dish is all about the sauce - but I'm still having freaky-big corn flashbacks. We also had the Papa a la Huancaina, which is actually a cold dish of potato and sauce - very good, delicious even, if you aren't allergic to the sauce :( For an entree I had the Lomo Fino, which seemed to be the filet mignon with the least amount of peppers involved, and was served with a side salad and mashed potatoes.  Everything about this dish was perfect and delicious - perfectly rare, perfect seasoning (was that cumin and rosemary perhaps?   YUM!) whatever was in the potatoes was amazing too. Desserts on the table included the flan (nothing special) and the rice pudding (very good). BYOB service was awesome - they had everything uncorked, chilled,  and a glass in my hand almost immediately.   Discovering that they are on  restaurant.com  pretty much guarantees I'll be back.",0.9959,0.787,0.192,0.021,0.665952380952381
2009-12-16,5.0,"I think it's about due time for me to put my Yelp review on here since I've been going here since April 09...I think this is around the time this place first opened? But I used to have Peruvian roommates and they're still close friends of mine, but every once in a while they would cook a nice savory meal, that had quite distinct flavors and absolutely savory. I moved to Miami for a bit and found a Peruvian restaurant and just got addicted to the Lomo Saltado. When I moved back to Chicago, I never found a place who can make it quite as tasty as in Miami, I thought it was just cause Miami's close presence to South America...until Machu Picchu opened...I usually start off with Papa a la Huancaina, an appetizer with potatoes and a unique cream cheese! So Great!...Then of course I order my fave...Lomo Saltado, grilled steak with fries and rice. I'm drooling as I think about this! I usually come here with groups of people to celebrate birthdays because of their BYOB, decent prices, and delicious eats. We usually call ahead of time and they'll accommodate us with a great seating arrangement and let us stay until all our bottles are finished (which never happens, cause we're a bunch of lushes and everyone brings a big bottle of wine, so it's too much to finish...on one occasion, a handle of Jack-argh).

However, the restaurant itself is like 1 star...the decor is super tacky, the tables and chairs are flimsy patio quality furniture (i am small and i felt like the chair could barely support my weight), there were little gnats flying around, some of the dishes came out dirty, the music they were playing was children singing Christmas songs in Spanish (so annoying!), and the mural painted on the wall of the girl w/a little llama was just WEIRD.  overall it gives off a cheap and tacky vibe, which is SO unfortunate because the food really is stellar!!  So i would recommend MP for delivery only, as i will not be going back to the restaurant.   Our waiter/the host was super friendly and made great recommendations.  And our water glasses never got half empty.  So good service overall.  To start, we had the Papa Rellena (our fave, SOOO tasty!!) which was served with thinly sliced red onions that were cooked in some sort of vinaigrette that complemented the dish perfectly, and the Causa Rellena de Pollo, which the waiter recommended, and tasted like chicken salad...it would be SO good as a sandwich spread!  We enjoyed both apps immensely.  For our entree, we split the Lomo Fino Machu Picchu, which was scrumptiously flavored beef (although it didn't taste like filet mignon, it tasted like sirloin) and even the veggies were flavored super delish!  We had a side of fried plaintains, which were by far the best plaintains my bf and i have ever had (and we've had a lot!), it was like our dessert - they were so sweet!   So MP, i recommend you clean up your space, pretend you are a classier establishment, and you can get repeat customers because your food is terrific!!",0.9978,0.738,0.235,0.026,0.567479674796748

2009-10-27,3.0,"Overall, very yummy and a nice experience!  But be prepared to wait!  Food comes out slow from the kitchen and servers are a bit slow - that's my biggest complaint.  Very easy street parking, and cannot beat the free BYOB! Atmosphere - it's very cozy inside, only about 20 tables in the whole place but they're spaced nicely.  First time I went on a Wed night and they had live music.  We sat 2 tables away from the band and were yelling across the table all night.  For such a small place, they do not need microphones! Service - I've been 2x in the past 3 weeks and had the same server both times.  He was very nice and gave good recommendations and was patient with us.  However, service here is s-l-o-w.  I think it's a combination of the slow servers plus slow service from the kitchen.  While the appetizers came out quickly, it took a long time for the entrees to come out.  Also took a while for the server to take our dessert order, and finally bring us our check both times.  Additionally, the last time i went they brought out 4 of 5 entrees, and told my friend they'd bring his steak out in 2 minutes as the cook as not their regular cook and was a bit slow.  His steak comes out over 5 min later, and the steak is undercooked AND the mashed potatoes were ice cold.  boo.  But at least I had a good meal :) Food - YUMMY.  For the most part, everything was very good and very flavorful.  They serve complimentary white crusty bread with this awesome spicy green sauce.  It looks creamy and tastes like pureed peppers, cilantro and other spices.  Super spicy, but very flavorful.  Had the Papa Rellenas for an app, it's very big, but for $8 I expected more than 1 ball.  It tasted decent, but was COLD in the center.  I think the Papa Rellenas at Habana Libre are better.   Entrees - first night I had the Steak with the Fettucini in the basil pesto sauce.  OMG sooo good.  It's a HUGE portion for only $14!  I only ate half and had a lovely lunch the next day.  Steak is very thin, but very big.  I wish I had tasted the pasta first, as the steak was so flavorful I had to heavily salt the pasta.  Second time I had the Arroz con Mariscos, their version of paella.  For $16 it's a helluva deal.  It's a huge pyramid of rice and a TON of different seafood items.  There were about 3 mussels on the shell, 1 clam, not too many scallops or shrimp, but a lot of calamari and peas and cilantro.  Oh, and 1 crab leg on top!  Very flavorful, didn't need salt.  YUM.  I still have leftovers in my fridge.   Dessert - Alfajores is awesome.  It's 2 shortbread-like cookies with dulce du leche in the middle.  YUM.  Pass on the chocolate cake, it's just so-so and I've had much better choc cake out of a box mix. Price - I used  restaurant.com  $25 off $35 purchase gift certificate each time I went, and went with 4 other people each time.  The gift certificate helped a little bit, but would be a better deal with only 2-3 people.  Oh, and they add an 18% gratuity if you use the gc.  Fine by me since I usually tip 20% Dinner #1 - 5 entrees and 5 desserts = $105 including 18% gratuity =  $21 per person. Dinner #2 - 3 appetizers, 5 entrees, and 1 extra side = $112 including gratuition = $22.50 per person Wonderful value, everyone left STUFFED each night.",0.999,0.807,0.188,0.005,0.5023239208049335

There were lapses where we wouldn't see him for a bit, and there was a long period before being seated and being able to order but that didn't diminish from the experience. Also, one of the plates spilled some sauce on the table, and he gave us a free dessert!  Food: The food I ordered was delicious. We started with the ""Papa a la Huancaina"" which we agreed was both amazing, and completely dependent on the huacaina sauce. My friend described it as a sort of ""spicy hollandaise"" but I found it to be a bit more rich. Regardless, it's worth going there for that dish alone. That being said, the dish could have used more than one half boiled egg as the combination of egg and sauce was the best tasting portion of that experience. I ordered the filet, which was rather standard but as it's a filet I definitely enjoyed it. My friend, however, got the seafood combination...I think he was so-so about it (except for the crab) but as I don't' especially enjoy seafood I'm going to steer clear of any critique. Ambiance: Better than expected. It had a sort of weird Latino house mix in the back that kind of reminded me of the Texas De Brazil song they loop in that place...very simple design but had an upscale feel.

Don't let the kitschy sign of the actual Machu Picchu turn you off to the place...the decor inside is simple.  Nothing bright or stand-out, and it did kind of feel like a basement, but not too bad. Having never had Peruvian food, I was a bit overwhelmed by the menu.  Yelp recommended the seafood ceviche, yet nowhere on Yelp or the menu did it say that ceviche was a cold dish!  I guess it was ignorance on my part, and my friends all seemed to know this fact, but I wasn't going to let temperature stop me from trying something new. The ceviche turned out to be pretty good, though a little to citrus-y for my tastes.  I wish they would've cut back a bit on the juice and let the seafood speak for itself, but maybe that's how it's supposed to be.  Tried some of my friend's steak, but didn't notice anything distinctly Peruvian about it. Like my previous review, I was just happy this place could accommodate a lot of us and we all had a good time.  I could definitely consider coming back and exploring more of their cuisine.",0.9862,0.793,0.162,0.045,0.5491243604879968

2009-07-14,5.0,"It had all the classic ingredients for the making of one hot mid-summer night. We were graciously served with adventuresome, highly-seasoned food, the absence of a corkage fee allowed for the delicious (over)indulgence of two fantastic bottles of red, and the quiet charm of my handsome dining companion easily drowned out the mediocre background music. The only thing missing? His guitar. Still, you could argue the stars lined up just so. So I guess I'll always remember this night - I fell in love with the food, the restaurant, all of it. This is the night I fell in love with my boyfriend. We started with the Choclo con Queso-- Peruvian corn with fresh cheese and accompanied by Huancaina sauce. At first, I was a bit intimidated by the huge size of the kernels, and the dilemma of eating straight from the cob or to nudge off with a fork. The fork won, and so did my 10,000 taste buds. A palate pleaser for sure, and the texture is wildly fun! Next up-- the Lomo Fino Machu Picchu for me and the Lomo Fino al Pacifico for him, both grilled perfectly to our requested medium. My Aji Panca-seasoned (sundried red chili) filet mignon was so good that I unintentionally gave my diced potatoes and steamed veggies the silent treatment. I stole a taste of his topped with a generous array of seafood and I admit, I was slightly green with envy: I had been out-ordered. Highly recommended! We tried to skip dessert but the call of dense chocolate cake was just too overwhelming. A sweet punctuation of an end to an even sweeter evening.  Bring a  restaurant.com  gift certificate to further maximize the value.

I'd never tried Peruvian food before, so I didn't know what to expect.  First I tried the Chicha Morada, which is a drink made from purple corn, cinnamon, and clove.  It was delicious, and not at all what I expected from a corn drink. I didn't know what to order, so the waiter helped me pick something.  I settled on the Lomo Saltado.  It's little slices of sirloin and veggies in sort sort of spices.  Even the rice that comes with it was delicious.  I'm not certain what my fiance ordered - it was some sort of chicken dish.  His was great also.     I've seen other reviews mention poor service, but our service was great.  The waiter was really helpful and refilled our water often.  Granted, we were there on a slow night, so it might be different when it's busier.

2009-07-08,4.0,"Thanks to my AWESOME  restaurant.com  discount, I was able to go out and have a lovely meal for a very reasonable price. Being a huge fan of Las Tablas and Tango Sur I was thinking I might find some similar items at this Peruvian steakhouse. I loved seeing that it was BYOB and has no corkage fee- BONUS!!  The place was nearly empty. And it's a big space. There are a couple of cool murals on the walls- large photos of mountains and girl with a lama. Very colorful. The ambiance could use a little kick though. It's just so sparse with tables packed into the room, covered in white table cloths. I was thinking how cool it would have been to have live music playing or something to add a little flavor. Fortunately, the flavor came with the meal. Our server brought out a bread basket with a small silver dish containing what looked like mustard. I dipped my fork in it to taste it and soon realized it was not mustard. At all. Be prepared people! This yellow chili sauce has some KICK! Yowza. Don't get me wrong.... I love XXX hot flavors that make sweat beads form on my face as I am eating. It was a nice, chili-flavored dipping sauce I ended up putting on everything else that came our way. Let me first focus on a phenomenon called ""Choclo con Queso,"" which is Peruvian corn with fresh cheese, served with Huancaina sauce (a buttery sauce for corn). I say 'phenomenon' because this corn was unlike anything I have ever laid eyes on. Each kernel was the size of a small grape. We were joking that it was genetically engineered or from Willy Wonka or something in a bizarro type world.  Truly, unreal. I guess it is simply corn from Peru. But it blew my mind. Be sure to order this appetizer when you go. I shared a salad called Ensalada Mixta, which was tomatoes, cucumber and avocado. It was a very large potion and perfect for two to share. The tangy dressing was very refreshing and the large pieces of avocado were meaty and fresh. The two entrees we had were the Tallarin Saltado con Camarone, which was sautéed fettuccini with shrimp, onions and tomatoes, cooked with soy sauce and the Lomo Fino Machu Picchu, Filet Mignon cooked on the grill, served with Machu Picchu diced potatoes, seasoned with Aji Panca (sun-dried red chili) and steamed vegetables. I substituted the potatoes for yucca fries.  The shrimp fettuccini was WWAAAYYY to big for one person. As in, probably 3 lbs of food. I only tried the shrimp from that plate and it was great. The size of the whole thing was very overwhelming and felt a bit gluttonous. My filet was delightful for the most part. It was a tad unevenly cooked, being more pink on one side than the other. But it was a very nice cut of meat and seasoned well. The steamed veggies that it came with were my favorite part though. They were more grilled than steamed, with char marks on them. Whatever seasoning they used was magical and I could have eaten a whole plate of these tasty morsels (carrots, broccoli, peas, corn, onion, tomato). I'd love to bring a large group here one night and try a bite of everyone's entrees to get a better idea of what else is on the menu. Some of the combinations were unfamiliar to me, including lots of egg, soy and olives in the dishes.  Our service was just right and I really liked all the food. The place, like I said, could use some spice. But that dipping sauce made up for it!!",0.9977,0.847,0.143,0.01,0.5696260425073985

Never had Peruvian food before but have driven past this restaurant a few times.  After reading reviews here and seeing that it was BYOB, my husband and I decided to give it try tonight (Sunday).  We loved it!   Interesting decor and murals. Large table set-ups which are perfect for groups.  They give you free bread (freshly toasted) and this green spicy dip (made with jalapenos) which was delicious.  Our waiter was very helpful and gave us suggestions on typical Peruvian appetizers and entrees. We ended up going with most of his suggestions and for appetizers ordered the corn with cheese dish and the papa rellena (mash potatotos stuffed with meat). Didn't care for the corn (not your typical corn-on-the-cob) but LOVED the papa rellena. Really interesting flavors. Then we shared the fried red snapper topped with garlic for our main course which was amazing. I've never really gotten the hang of cooking fish at home, so this was a treat. They seasoned the fish before frying it so the skin was crispy and full of  spices.  For dessert, I couldn't decide so our waiter recommended a 1/2 and 1/2 of two of his favorite desserts -- the rice pudding and the one with purple corn. I wasn't sure about the purple corn since we didn't like his corn appetizer suggestion, but said okay.  Well, we were pleasantly surprised!  The purple corn was sweet and had a consistency similar to apple butter. The rice pudding was good too if you like rice pudding.   Will definitely be coming back and bringing friends along. I asked about the BYOB policy and he said that you can bring anything - wine, beer, and even liquor!  He even suggested bringing a bottle of Peruvian liquor (can't remember the name but said you can find it at the liquor store on Devon & Clark) and said they'd mix it with sour mix for you. Sweet!  I'm definitely sold on coming back. We left there quite satisifed with our meal and not feeling over-stuffed.

2009-02-02,3.0,"I heard about MP through word of mouth, I think I caught a few reviews about it and then I was able to score a gift cert off  restaurant.com . Stopped in on a lazy Sunday afternoon, this restaurant is far different than what I expected from what I'd heard. It is not one of those fast food type of places like, what you might find when going to the Mom and Pop churrascarias. It's not a churrascaria either. It's Peruvian fine dining. In the past I'd also heard some chatter about their food causing grumblings in peoples tummy's after having meals. I found all of their food to be flavorful and enticing. Note: if spicy foods give you the grumbles, ask for your food to be toned down. Some of the entrees and appetizers hit close to home and reminded me of Indian food. If you like one, you'd love the other (Indian / Peruvian), there are some similarities with some of their entrees. I had this lamb dish, chunks of lambs meat with a sauce which reminded me of lamb curry. Then this appetizer which was like a turnover, to me like a samosa, except the insides carried their own flavors so that you didn't need any sauce to accompany. MP makes their own hot sauce, I can't place my fingers on the flavors, it's like a green salsa, perhaps made with guacamole or some other vegetable. It's got one of those slow heat feelings, the flavor grows on you and the heat slowly but surely creeps up on you. Watch out. They serve theirs with lightly toasted buttered french bread, it was good, I could've sat and had that as a meal. You can take some home for the price of $6 for 12 oz or 32 oz for... can't remember. (12 ounces goes a long way, they give it in a Solo cup, make sure you transfer it to a container as soon as possible so it lasts longer. The solo cup bleeds after a few days) Servings are large enough to require takeout after. Cost is above average depending on your entree. Entrees are about $13-$19 and the more expensive dishes may be seafood. In case you have people not interested in trying Peruvian food, they have a standard steak or chicken and potatoes option.

As for the service, it wasn't as good as the food.  The restaurant is BYO, so we brought a bottle of wine.  Our server did not bother to poor our glasses, didn't bring us a chilled bucket (it was Vidal) and never bothered to watch our glasses to see if needed refills.  I know that Machu Picchu is not exacty fancy schmancy, but an initial poor would have been nice.  Also, I'm not quite sure our server was all too keen on the English language, as I told him that I was allergic to dairy so he pointed to the vegetarian dish and said ""no"" to me asking if the chef could simply remove the cheese sprinkled on top of a few of the dishes.  Oh well, food was still great.    Though, the food was pretty darn good, we were not quite interested in paying the extra fifteen bucks that they had thrown on our bill that we had noticed once we got home.  Upon calling to double check, they did recognize their error and told us that they would just take the tip off the credit card.  The tip was eight bucks.  ????  Nice try, Pals...we made  them take off the extra fifteen bucks. Later on, to clear up my menu confusion, I Wikied Peruvian food and learned that there is much Chinese influence in Peru, and Italian as well.  Now I know.  One thing that I am not confused about is the great food.  Though, the service was a little weird, to say the least, I'll be back for some of those yummy meat filled fried mashed potato bombs and I look forward to trying some of their fish dishes.",0.9951,0.779,0.169,0.052,0.5094914156138646

2008-02-20,1.0,"YUCK.  I usually don't like writing bad reviews, but this place is horrible.  The service is horrible.  We were seated and it took them about 10 minutes to come to our table (there was one large table and about 2 other people in the whole place).  We were just about to walk out when the ""waitress"" came over with some water glasses (which we had to ask to have re-filled).  It took another 5 minutes for her to bring us some cold bread in a basket that had a chunk of half eaten bread in it.  Nasty.  I'm not sure why, but we decided to stick it out.   We ended up ordering a meal for 2...BIG mistake.  After about 40 minutes it started out with some sort of mashed potato covered thing that really had no flavor.  That was served 2 minutes before our Entree.  Our Entree was a mound of bland green rice with veggies in it.  Three lumps of dried out chicken, some beef pot roast type of thing (that wasn't horrible), and a pile of tripe that looked like something my dog threw up, smelled like feet and tasted even worse.  There was a large party that seemed to get a lot of attention and the food they had on the table looked good.  We obviously ordered the wrong thing, but you would think the meal for two would showcase the best dishes they have.  We barely ate anything, and ended up ordering take out from Chicago's when we got home.  I seriously doubt I will ever go back.   They were blasting the Mark Anthony DVD, and standing around the back bar talking.",-0.9809,0.807,0.05,0.143,0.5612727807172251

The food was good the first time but I have been way more impressed the last 2 times I have been there. I took my boyfriend there because he has been begging me to go there forever! I ate the Lomo Saltado because it is the best thing on the menu and who doesn't want that. Sirloin steak strips with onions, tomatoes, and french fries grilled with yummy seasonings with white rice. Eat it! My boyfriend had seco de cordero which we both also enjoyed. His was veal in a light gravy with veggies with white rice as well. We also shared a side of platanos maduros, fried plantains. You absolutely can't go wrong with that. BYOB and no corking fee is great as well. Jewel and Que Syrah are on Southport not that far away in case you forget to bring wine. If you haven't tried Peruvian food before definitely come here. The price is great because it is BYOB, the staff are very attentive and the manager is very friendly. They also do take-out and the food is ready quickly and is hot! Old review-I had something with shrimp. It was too fishy for me. Although the rice and vegetables were delicious. Started with emapandas-you just can't go wrong with those.  Went there during the day at an off time to it was really quiet but every other time I drive by it looks full.",0.9973,0.737,0.242,0.021,0.5575140809011776

I don't really like food, so I ordered what the waitress recommended, the lomos... something. It was meat pieces and rice and french fries all mixed up with a tasty liquid of some sort. It was an enormous portion, and, as further endorsement, I can tell you I will be eating it again later on today.  My best friend, Mary Lee, ordered ceviche, which came served under a huge pile of red onions (super gross). However, she fed me little bites. Ceviche, apparently, is snippets of various fishes served ice cold. However, all of this tasted like cilantro, herb of angels.  I particularly like the one that was soft and white, though the chewy white one was not without its charms.  Beware- there's a super spicy green sauce served with the bread that I thought would be like guacamole but instead tasted like death.

2007-08-15,5.0,"Being half Peruvian, I'm always on the look out for new Peruvian restaurants in the city. For the most part, I've tried each one as they've come and gone or stuck around and changed into something dissapointing. I've been hard pressed to find authentically seasoned dishes until now... This place is truly a great find. We went on two separate nights four weeks apart - a Sunday and Saturday - for late dinners - 7:30.  Both times we were thrilled with the food and service.  Our waiter the first night was dutiful about replacing the water, taking our order and promptly removing dishes as they were consumed and checking on us to see if we needed anything.  Our waitress on the second night had that whole timing thing down pat - bringing entrees within a minute or two of finishing appertizers. We ordered an appetizer apiece (there were four of us) so we could each sample. We were asked if we wanted them all together or spaced out and they came just as we wanted.  Their 'aji', served with bread, was fabulous! It came the second we sat down - which was great - as we were famished and traveled an hour and half to get there! The papa a la huancaina was perfect! The sauce was dead on - not too granular from the cheese used. We lopped up the extra sauce with the bread provided.  The anticuchos were beef hearts as they should be. They were wonderful - not tough and plenty flavorful without going over board. It was a surprize to see them on the menu as beef hearts are not usally used in some other Peruvian restaurants and are changed into steak, which is my pet peeve.  The papa rellena was great - just the right seasoning & amount of beef and raisins for sweetness.  The ceviche mixto was divine - tangy and the seafood was fresh and onions not wilted. The entrees were as authentic as if my grandma had made them. The seco de carne was very tender and the flavor - the mix of wine and cilantro right on. The aji de gallina was to die for - just the right amount of flavor and heat from the aji amarillo and nuttiness from the walnuts. The lomo saltado was great - again the meat flavored just right and the fries still crispy, but infused subtlely with the seasonings and onions accompanying them. The sopa a la minuta was perfect! Again, all the right amounts of seasoning and angel hair noodles not overcooked. For dessert we had the ice creams and rice pudding. I enjoyed their creative presentations of the ice creams which come in lemon, mango, and coconut.  We caught the tail end of the guitarist and singer on Saturday and so didn't get the whole 'they were too loud' thing as others have mentioned. They added to the ambiance of the place. Also, as we finished dessert, the owner's wife came out and asked how everything went, which I thought was a nice touch. I noticed on the previous evening, the husband was making the rounds seemingly to genuinely care for patrons feed back. I plan on going next Saturday to celebrate a belated birthday with a friend & this time, will bring the pisco :) Salud!!",0.9952,0.875,0.112,0.014,0.5271415453233635
2007-08-12,2.0,"We went with a big group of 20, and we were warned that the service is awful. We kept on everyone to order first and talk second. The appetizers were both fast and tasty, especially the ceviche. I'm not sure, but the empanades seemed like they were microwaved - yuck. We were feeling pretty good at this point and even though one of the ceviches was not the one we ordered, we were starting to think that service would be ok. We were totally wrong! From the first entree that arrived at the table to the last, it took them over two hours to serve everyone. People had finished eating long before others had been served. The order that dishes came out of the kitchen was totally random. Someone who arrived an hour after everyone else was served half an hour before the last dish hit the table - with the chaos that was already under way, he didn't care that they messed up his order. Now, what burns me is when things are falling apart and the wait staff are standing around doing nothing but just looking out at the room. How do you know if your table needs something, like water!, when you're across the room? Walk your lazy butt over to our table and ask if there's something you can get for us. It took a half hour to get ketchup for one friend, even after asking twice. To add insult to injury, it was band night. The band had the mistaken notion that we were all there - not to eat a meal and enjoy friends - but instead to do nothing but listen intently to them. WRONG! The music was so loud you could not talk to someone directly across the table from you. The band leader kept asking the ""audience"" how we were doing, and the ""I can't hear you"" prodding was obnoxious. The food was good, not great. The BYO status makes it a cheap place. So two stars. Go on a weeknight, with no more than 4 people, and bring lots to drink. You will need it while you wait for your food.",-0.9603,0.781,0.086,0.133,0.5311507936507937

It's so unfortunate I can't give it 5 stars because their service is pretty much non-existent.  I guess (what Americans would call) bad service comes with authenticity of the food and atmosphere. I took my half-Peruvian friend last Friday. She kept saying how Peruvian things were(especially the live music)  We happened to be there when a group of people from Peruvian Lyons Club was present, so we got to see an unofficial  Peruvian dance performance as well. They have live music on every Friday and Saturday. It can get pretty loud. Food was great. Excellent for the price.(The most of entrees run at around 10-14 dollars) We had lomo saltado, which is sort of like Peruvian stir-fry with beef, french fries, onions, peppers, and other veggies served with steamed seasoned rice. It's supposed to be a pretty typical Peruvian dish. We also had Arroz con Mariscos, which to me tasted like seafood paella, but only better. We also had fried fish(supposed to be a kind of fish that lives in the Amazon) with lots of garlic spread which was delish. We also had the same fish in a steamed version with tomato based sauce, veggies and cilantro. It was awesome!!! We all enjoyed our food and time tremendously at this restaurant. I was starving to death because it probably took them almost an hour to serve our food, but that's why you bring plenty of boozes to get yourselves started. A great BYOB restaurant. They already have a bar set up and ready to serve alcohol as soon as they obtain a liquor license, so hurry in before they do!  Parking was almost impossible(took us good 20 minutes), but it might have been just that weekend due to the concert in Lakeview. Update 07/20/07 Took my boyfriend's family and him for his birthday dinner. What a great place to have a birthday party since they let you bring in your own cake/dessert or what not(and it's BYOB). They make sure people know it's your birthday. I think they sang the B-day song for him like three times- the band, the waiters, and the band again. Again friendly service, but extremely slow.It was almost like a self-service restaurant.   This time I tried, tamales, Jalea de Mariscos. Jalea de Mariscos is basically sole fillet and calamari seasoned and fried, and it's served with fried yucca,potatoes, and zesty onion salad. So yummy!!

2007-06-21,4.0,"After hearing Elizabeth H.'s review of Machu Picchu, I figured it would be a while until we tried to venture back to this Peruvian place.  Even with the service nightmares of her first visit, just three weeks later she couldn't resist the temptation of tamales and other Peruvian delicacies.  To have such a strong desire to go back, I knew the food must be worth it. There were four of us for dinner and we were seated immediately and greeted by a pleasant waitress.  Perhaps they finally caught on that their service had been completely lacking, because from the time we sat down until we left, we were greeted with prompt, friendly service.  Our appetizers came out quickly, our entrees were served on-time and our water glasses were never left empty.  It was a great surprise, especially considering we were expecting lackluster service. As for the food - everything was amazing.  Wait - everything except the tripe that came with our dinner for two.  That wasn't their fault, we were being adventurous and had plenty of other food, so we went ahead and had them bring it.  It must be an acquired taste - and honestly, one I will NEVER acquire.  The appetizers, entrees and sides were all to die for.  The chicken and rice was amazing.  Actually, they could've left the chicken off and I would have been content just eating the flavorful rice.  Our shredded chicken was very tasty, but the appetizers were the highlight of the meal.  The ceviche, tamale and some fried potato thing (I didn't order it) were all top-notch.   For now this place is BYOB, and it seems that they got their service issues in check.  It's a fairly nondescript atmosphere, but the food is worth the trip.",0.9634,0.883,0.108,0.008,0.5203703703703704
2007-06-09,3.0,"Last night I ventured out to my 'M' pick of the week, Machu Picchu.  I was surprised at how full the restaurant was for being rather new.  Only one open table when we walked in.  I was very impressed with almost all the food during the evening.  The spicy-green sauce with bread was an excellent start to the evening, which quickly disappeared into the mouths of three hungry patrons.  For an appetizer we tried the papa relleno, tamales, and a dish that had some sort of egg, cream cheese and olive mix.  All three we tasted were incredible, with the Papa Relleno being the best.  (On a weird side note, just like another reviewer, they were out of the empenadas)   For dinner we had the rabbit in peanut sauce, lobster paella, and the shrimp cooked in beer.  The rabbit and lobster were excellent and filling.  The shrimp was a little too bland for my taste. Unfortunately while the food was incredible, the service was far from being acceptable.  At one point while eating, I asked my dinner-mates, ""Machu-Picchu or Hop Haus?""  That should give you an idea of how the service was.  It took about 25 minutes to get our appetizers and then another 40 minutes to get our entrees (which ended up coming out at three different times).  We also had empty water glasses for most of the evening.  (Luckily we had two bottles of wine to help quench our thirst).  I was also informed by my friend that the women's bathroom didn't have toilet paper as well.  It's unfortunate, as it seemed like every employee was working hard.  It made me think that a small corkage fee would be worth it knowing that it could go to hiring a bus boy.   Food - 4 Stars Service - 2 Stars Bonus 1/2 star for hearing ""Little Drummer Boy"" in Spanish while we were eating.",0.9785,0.85,0.113,0.037,0.6337774294670847
2007-06-04,3.0,"First off, let me say, the food here is FAN-TAS-TIC! At least, what we were able to eat. The service here left A LOT to be desired. I went here with some friends. We had an 8:30 reservation and we needed to leave by 10:15. We thought that would be plenty of time. Alas, it wasn't.  When we arrived, we stood by the door for a few minutes, until we were even acknowledged. When we finally were taken to our table, it took at least 10 minutes to get menus, and another 20 minutes to get our wine opened. AND we had to flag down our server several times to even get that accomplished. We then placed our appetizer order. By 9:35, we hadn't gotten our appetzers OR placed our entree order yet.  All around us, you could tell patrons were getting upset. At least two tables walked out without getting their food.  We ended up getting only two of the five entrees we ordered. AND we had to scarf them down. What we were able to eat though was AMAZING. SO good. We had the papa rellanos and cerviche mixto for starters. The papa rellans are mashed potaotes stuffed with a meat cheese filling and then deep fried. SO tasty. And the Ceviche was light and fresh.  The entrees we got were a redsnapper with Shrimp in a red wine sauce served with rice. This actually came out first and I think was intended for one of the tables that had walked out so it look like it had been sitting a bit, but again, so tasty. I don't know what it is, but peruvian spices are really yummy. But truly the highlight was the second entree, the lomo saltado; a beef dish with fries, onion, tomatoes served in a red sauce. It just sort of melted in your mouth. Everyone was in agreement that this was heaven. Unfortuntely our ecstasy was short-lived, as we had to track down another server, get our bill and dash out the door.  I must say, it wasn't as if the servers were unhelpful. Everyone we encountered was really friendly and seemed as if they wanted to help. There was just on over-arching sense of unorganization. It was really too bad. I did find out from a manager that they are planning on adding additional wait staff in the next coming week. I hope this helps.  Truly, If they could get the service to match the quality of their food, this place would be top-notch. And despite the less-than-stellar service, I will be  back to sample more of the Peruvian goodness. I'll just allow lots of extra time!",0.9958,0.84,0.14,0.02,0.3985714285714286
2007-05-31,4.0,"Last night, a few of my friends and I decided to have a girls' night...  You know, grab a bottle of wine or two and hit up the nearest BYOB.  Having seen Machu Picchu under construction and reading a nice review in the Red Eye, I decided this would be the perfect destination. The service here is phenomenal!  One woman, whom we believe to be one of the owners, was so pleasant, and the young man who was our server was incredibly polite.  They serve sliced bread with this spicy green sauce when you sit down and my friend was obsessed (and yes, it was that good!) so the owner told us how to make it.  Sharing trade secrets?  Good enough to keep me coming back! Really, anything in this space is better than the old island-themed dive that formerly inhabited this space.  But the fact that they serve great food makes it all the better.   We tried the Peruvian tamales, which, to be honest, were a little lacking in the filling department, but not in flavor.  The papa relleno was absolutely amazing!  (Minus one star for being out of empanadas and not having another appetizer we had wanted.  I guess they only have it on the weekends, but we didn't know!) And then the three of us split the main dish: estufado de carne.  Mouth watering!  I suppose this dish is best described as Peruvian stew or pot roast in a red wine sauce served with rice.  Or you could also just call it goodness on a plate!   They have a rather extensive menu (including a lobster paella that looked amazing when the table next to us got their order) so it made the selection process difficult.  But difficult in a good way! Everything is reasonably priced, which is a plus when the purse strings need to be pulled a little tighter.  Just make sure you have enough $$$ to tip the great staff adequately! The restaurant is currently BYOB without a cork fee, so double score!  Take advantage now, because  I understand they're in the process of getting a liquor license.
