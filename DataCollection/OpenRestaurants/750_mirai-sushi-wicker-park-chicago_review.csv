Mirai has now forced my hand--in 2017, I'm going to finish off one of Eater's ""essential"" lists for sushi spots in Chicago, so that I can really come back and say for sure that Mirai does or does not belong on my personal list.  I would probably take the sushi at Yuzu and Arami, but Mirai is a better pick for me than Seadog Sushi or Coast, two other spots in the general Wicker Park/Bucktown 'hood.",0.7227,0.899,0.068,0.033,0.3116292735042735

2016-06-24,5.0,"As a Japanese professional from Tokyo, attending physicians even ask me where my favorite sushi restaurant in Chicago is. After having tried several downtown, I can now say that it is Mirai Sushi in Wicker Park.  Our first visit, we tried their sushi counter and ordered piece by piece. Cheap, it was not, but the price was in the range I expected it to be. The portion was the perfect fit in your mouth and the fish slice balanced with the rice portion. I knew we had a real sushi master who knows what he is doing with his rice. I stamped it my seal of approval and we decided to take our all-American friends out for an authentic Japanese sushi experience at Mirai Wicker Park. To me, sushi is either the high end Kyubei or your neighborhood favorite and I prefer the let your hair down vibe of Mirai Wicker Park over Gold Coast for now.  I spoke with the owner and famed restauranteur Mieae Lim to arrange a pre-ordered meal, one with an impossible dietary request of vegan with no oil. Like a true restauranteur, she handled it with a breeze and all dishes were authentic and delicious. Service was friendly and Miae remained attentive yet in the background. I am so grateful to the chef for putting up with such a disrespectful request at a sushi place. A sushi master-owner in Tokyo would have turned us down for sure.  You don't have to be Japanese to run a great Japanese restaurant, but it is rare to find one that showcases the respect that the trained sushi masters deserve. Just because you are a Japanese chef does not make you a sushi master.  Many Japanese owned operations in Chicago have also closed shop for not having the savvy of Mirai's owner.

Here's the breakdown: - space: good outdoor area, tables not too crowded - food: had the cold edamame (fine), spicy momo (good), honey tempura shrimp (ok-pretty sweet & tempura was not very crunchy... Not something we ordered but more on that later...) - service: hostess was great, walked in without a resy and they were very accommodating... Waiter was fine initially, but then he disappeared, which wouldn't have been a big deal if the entrees had shown up in at least near proximity to each other... The chefs special (3 pieces of nigiri which was I was most looking forward too) never showed up even after we were done with the meal and everyone's plates had been cleared, which is when the aforementioned shrimp showed up on the house.  Apparently on a Saturday night they only had one sushi chef working who was backed up... We cancelled the nigiri and just got the check.... While this would usually lead me to knock the rating down a star, the hostess and the complimentary appetizer evened it out. - price: on the pricier side but nothing insane, plus it's raw fish, so not the place to go cheap",0.9772,0.843,0.135,0.021,0.46211741961741964

The hostess was doubling up as our waitress too- normally not a big deal, but this was Valentine's Day- when I expect the service to be a little more above average. The table next to us saw 2 parties before we saw our waitress to ask for the check.  No recommendations were made. No specials were presented. Our table was right by the door, so every time the door opened we got a jet stream of frigid air.  Rolls and fish were very small for the price. I can think of 5 places off the top of my head that are a third the price and twice the quality. Honey glazed shrimp tasted and presented like something I could've gotten at Panda Express (albeit did taste good).  Long story short, $70 later we were still hungry, underwhelmed, and wondering where else we could've given our Valentine's Day business. Nori is far better than Mirai - bottom-line, and that's where we should've gone.  I will say one thing more, the waitress did comp a round of cocktails (2) for us to make up for it, which I appreciated, but this was in the middle of the ordeal, and nothing improved toward the end of the evening which tells me she was just throwing us a bone.",0.811,0.885,0.07,0.044,0.4134285714285714

2014-08-15,1.0,"BAD EXPERIENCE with chef Kano being rude. That, plus the consistently low quality of fish in the last few years puts Mirai in my ""Not Recommended"" list unless you only settle for spicy tuna and rolls where fish flavor is fully veiled beneath plenty of mayonnaise and Korean red pepper sauce. I certainly won't go back -- as persona non-grata :) Went to Mirai after a few months. Sat in front of Chef Shoji whom I like very much and think is a good chef.  He talked to me all the time and did his best in preparing good food for me. Many thanks Shoji. I noticed something strange as Chef Kano totally ignored me.  I felt it had to do something with my past review (please see below). Lo and behold it did!!  (Please read my review below where i had started by saying i loved the chefs). I was uncomfortable enough that I left a bit hungry. I told Shoji goodbye and walked in front of Chef Kano to whom I said goodbye too. He practically yelled at me in an aggressive manner and twice asked me if the food was ok (hinting to my past review, i reckon).  Normally I do not take such a sh**t but i let it be. In my old age, i am learning to be quiet and patient in front of aggressive juveniles.  Frankly, I understand and respect how a negative (in this case neutral 3 stars) review may hurt a chef's feeling. If the chef is so darn proud of his work, he should stop serving 3 days old sashimi or stop buying from third rate suppliers. Just go try Katsu and see the difference. I had rated Elizabeth 3 stars the first time I went there. It is now a 5 stars restaurant in my book and one of my favorites in town. Elizabeth people did not jump on me giving them 3 stars. Mirai used to be much better 6 or 7 years ago. This is why i used to go there often then. In Japan many sushi chefs believe you can tell a good chef by how they make the rice. They say it is easy to get high quality fish. Money can buy it. Rice requires more skills. I am not going to make any comments regarding the rice at Mirai.  Two nights ago when i had my dinner at Mirai, Uni was delicious. Ikura was fine. Salmon was nicely done. Amae Ebi felt dry. Ankimo was dry and bad. Other items from fish quality of perspective were nothing to write home about.  Chef Shoji did the best he could given the fish in front of him, spent time talking to me in Japanese. I sincerely appreciate his work, and friendship.",0.9922,0.778,0.154,0.069,0.4553921568627452

It was all mixed in and buried and by the time I realized it was too late to send it back. Plus what's the point? So that started the meal off poorly.  We had the gyoza dumplings- tasted like when you buy frozen ones and heat. Not terrible but certainly not good. Then the crispy honey shrimp- not good. Tiny shrimp, not crispy at all (was there supposed to be a batter or something?) and strange sauce.  We tried two rolls which were not good- fish was kind of mushy. We also ordered (and paid for) fresh wasabi. The amount that came out was laughable. Smaller than a thimble- certainly not enough to share. Thanks but no thanks.  We were there less than an hour.

We took 30 min to find parking and it wasn't even close parking. When we got there, there were plenty of tables available so we didn't lose our reservation and the hostess was pretty cool about it. Overall we thought this place was okay.. it definitely isn't a favorite of ours. Like most reviewers here mentioned, this place IS expensive. My husband and I are sushi mavens, so we've tried out many sushi restaurants in Chicago and plan to do try more. We don't foresee ourselves coming back here anytime soon.. the portions are smaller than usual and the price tag is high. We started with the bin cho salad. It was okay..it's slices of tuna with arugla salad..we thought the tuna slices would be on top of a bed of arugula but it's just few pieces of arugula and 5 pieces of fish..for $11. Next we had the Mirai combination. This one was really good. There's 6 sashimi pieces of different kinds of fish..each coming out to be $3 each which is a steal! We both enjoyed it! Then we had the seafood udon which I thought was okay but my husband really liked the broth. For sushi rolls, we had the tuna tuna salmon roll (which everyone here was raving about) and it was good. No soy sauce needed! We also had the special salmon which was okay. I enjoyed the shrimp tempura inside the sushi more. My husband thought the batter for the shrimp tempura was too salty. We also had the spicy tuna roll..which is not good. I only had one piece and didn't want to eat it anymore. It's small and not flavorful. I definitely advise to not order this spicy tuna roll. We also ordered the shrimp togarashi which was pretty good. Comes in 5 pieces.. the seven spice sauce was really good. I would enjoy the sauce with other dishes as well!

I came here for my friend's birthday dinner and the service was really slow. It took about 20 minutes just to get drinks. We started off with the tuna carpaccio, with was actually a tuna ""salad"" - with lettuce, eggs, tomatoes, mango, etc. The tuna slices were thick, so it was really anything but a carpaccio. The combination of ingredients was quite odd to me. Next came the sushi. The sushi is really tiny, so it took about 6 rolls for me and my friend to be satisfied. And even then, we left a little hungry. The vegetarian special is phenomenal: a combination of beets, sweet potato, and other delicious vegetables. If I were to come back, I would order three of those and be done for the night. Except that roll alone is $15-$16.

I had never had Shishito peppers before, so we ordered those as an appetizer.  They came out with a light and crispy Tempura batter, still hot from the fryer.  Very simple- just whole peppers, lightly battered with a sprinkling of sea salt.  For what it is, I think $4.50 is a very reasonable price for that appetizer... in fact, I'm pretty sure I've paid way more money for things I've enjoyed a lot less. Little things make me happy- like the fact that I don't have to break apart my chopsticks.  They're nice and smooth.  Even more cool (to me) is that both ends of the chopsticks are tapered. I guess I just appreciate thoughtfully designed, high quality single-use cutlery?   Tonight's visit was all about the sushi, and that's where this review will stay: * Marinated Salmon Nigiri- the soy flavor wasn't intense, and really let the salmon flavor shine through.   * Yellowtail scallion- most places I try this at, the scallion flavor is almost nonexistent.  The scallions were fresh and gave a nice texture contrast to the yellowtail. * Yamagobo-  It's pickled burdock root, since my desire to be a know-it-all forced me to Google it at the restaurant.  Nicely flavored, still crunchy.   * Unagi Trio-  I needed my unagi fix, and this was the only way to get it since there wasn't an option for it as a traditional roll.  At first I thought it was going to be a little like the 'Pimp My Ride' of sushi where Xzibit was going to show up and tell me he layered some unagi on top of my unagi and wrapped it in unagi while giving it an unagi sauce bath, yo.  But no, it was not overpowering in the least.   * Tuna Tuna Salmon- my favorite roll of the evening!  Try it.  I don't want to ruin it for you. Not to gush, but even the rice was awesome- it was never packed to hard and had a great flavor & consistency in both the nigiri and maki.  Our server made sure to tell us when the chef recommended no soy sauce for the rolls, and I love that.  To me, it's a friendly reminder that a lot of thought was put into the flavors, and the chefs want you to appreciate it the way it was intended... so mess it up at your own risk. As we were about to leave, one of those freak Chicago thunderstorms blew in- the valet offered to hail us a cab without even asking.  Yes, it was a weeknight at 6 and he didn't really have much else to do, but it's still fantastic customer service.   Okay, I give up.  I'm gushing.  I heart Mirai.",0.9942,0.792,0.16,0.048,0.6183417764268828

2013-06-24,5.0,"I think I've completed my sushi trifecta search for Chicago.  I've found a 5 star option to meet every type of sushi outing.  Coast is my 5 star option for a more casual BYOB sushi experience.  Kai Zan is my 5 star option for a mind-blowing creative omakase experience.  Sunda is my 5 star option for a trendy night out on the town.  And Mirai is now my 5 star option for a romantic sushi outing when you want something a little bit fancier than Coast but not in the mood to get all dolled up for Sunda. My fiance and I checked out Mirai last week and we were pleasantly surprised with both the quality of the food, the relaxing ambiance, friendly service, and oh...did I mention the food?  I've heard the upstairs lounge is the place to be, but that is apparently only on Fridays and Saturdays, so we sat downstairs in the main restaurant area which was perfectly classy without being pretentious.  It was slightly cold for patio seating (since Chicago refuses to recognize summer this year), so we sat inside, but the patio is quite nice for warmer days. We started with a couple of cocktails, I had the Cucumber Passion which was delicious and unique as it was more muddled and cloudy than your usual cucumberish martini.  A little heavy on the cucumber (which I loved) but may not be for everyone.  My fiance ordered the lychee martini that was also very delicious.  It started out a little too sweet but tapered off after a few sips. For appetizers we went with the gyoza ravioli.  I'm a pescetarian so I was very excited to see a shrimp option for gyoza that wasn't combined with pork or chicken.  The ginger was a nice touch, and this was a great appetizer choice with a lighter soy sauce and a hint of sweetness. For sushi, we ordered the Tuna Tuna Salmon, the Special Zuke, and a Negi hamachi roll.  All 3 rolls were made with the highest quality fish.  Hamachi is always my guide to see how fresh a sushi place is and this hamachi was top notch and delicious.    The Tuna Tuna Salmon was worth salivating over and the negi hamachi roll was generously filled with yellowtail and had scallions inside (which I prefer) rather than just sprinkled on top.  The Special Zuke roll was pretty good but a little overbearing on the tempura.  It was enjoyable but probably our least favorite of the 3. We also ordered the Shrimp Togarashi hot plate and were basically blown away by this.  The shrimp does come with the shell on, so you have to peel it off, but it's well worth the effort.  The sauce is finger licking good.  And it's hard to say finger licking when you're referring to a more upscale restaurant, but I don't care.  Even after we finished the shrimp, we added more rice to the plate just to soak up all the sauce...and our server was not remotely surprised by this, so apparently this is a common occurrence.  Seriously...order this dish. Prices in general are a little bit higher on the specialty sushi rolls as most of them come as 6 pieces (large pieces) for $16.  However, the standard rolls and the nigiri are priced very reasonably for the quality you are getting.  The hot plates, cold plates, and appetizers are very comparable to just about any sushi restaurant out there, and this quality blows away 99% of the sushi places in Chicago.  We will happily come back to Mirai in the very near future!",0.999,0.794,0.194,0.012,0.6228322672352525

Our house Salads were DRENCHED in dressing (the ginger dressing was the worst dressing I've ever had before and ginger dressing is my favorite). The ahi tuna salad we got was very good (the only above par part of our meal). The sushi menu was extremely tiny and mainly Sashimi. We asked our waiter if they could make us something similar to a rainbow roll and his response was ""No, we like to stick to 'traditional' sushi pieces."" Whatever that means. The sushi was mediocre at best. Very plain and hardly any meat in it.  When we got our check the 2 untouched (uneatable) salads we returned were still on the check. The waiter gave me attitude when I asked if he was going to charge us. I started to walk away from him when he asked another server/manager what he should do, who promptly told him to take it off.

In the rest of the world, Japanese food is a lot simpler. I'm not looking for a huge menu or crazy things. I just want quality. I find their fish to be incredibly fresh.

2013-02-07,2.0,"NOT GLUTEN FREE FRIENDLY!! Actually, not friendly at all anymore. I very rarely write a bad review but I was super disappointed in my experience on Saturday night. I had made a reservation for 4 people at 8pm for the upstairs lounge specifically. When we got there they said it would be a 45 minute wait for the upstairs. I told him I had a reservation and he said 'sorry, we over sat' but I can seat you downstairs right away. We didn't fight it because we were all starving but it was freezing! Every time someone opened the door, we were cold. I've been there no less than 20 times when I lived in Chicago a few years ago- used to be my favorite to go in and say- ""I'm allergic to wheat so I can't have the soy sauce- can they accomodate me?"" and ALWAYS the chef would make me a few rolls that I could eat no worries. I go in this time and asked if they could accomodate or if they had a gluten free menu and the host literally said 'you're probably not going to be able to eat anything here- it's a very soy sauce-rich menu' and I said well can't they put the sauce on the side?' and his response was 'a lot of the rolls are pre-made.' I said 'pre-made?? you guys never did that before? I would prefer fresh sushi?' he said 'well it's mostly fresh' and I said 'so what's  pre-made then?' and he said the 'inside of the rolls?' I was soo confused. I literally ended up getting a few pieces of nagiri and sashimi because even the house salad had soy sauce in the dressing. It took forever for us to get drinks and food. It was just really disappointing because this used to be my favorite sushi place in Chicago and I'll probably never go back there based on the attitudes I got and how unaccomodating they were. I'm not asking for the chef to make a brand new roll for me that's not on the menu but if you're pre-making sushi, you can't advertise that it's fresh.

I heard from a co-worker that Mirai is his all time fav sushi place and then I came across a Rue La La special (which was *quite* the deal). For the special, we were limited to a smaller menu, but they still offered some of their most popular entrees. The second time we came, we got some of the same dishes and went all out. Here are the ones we liked the most: -Tuna Tuna Salmon. I love this roll bc its so innovative. Rather than using seaweed, it's wrapped with rice paper. It melts in your mouth and then the smooth texture of the fish sinks into your tongue. Amazing, eat-with-your-eyes-closed in every bite.  -Shrimp Togarashi. The shrimp are butterflied and grilled. It's slathered in some spicy concoction that reminds me of northern Chinese spices (so very spicy!) and then the remaining sauce is poured all over it. It's literally an explosion in your mouth. We kept saying we'd eat plain rice with the sauce- it was that good.  -Spicy Mono. The texture of the octopus is outstanding. Often octopus is tough if not grilled, but it's so fresh and marinated so well.  -Mango Passion Fruit Sangria. Soo goood. This drink didn't taste very alcoholic. So either it was light in alcohol or was truly that well made. I had two and then the Lychee martini, which was not as good. Other things I love about Mirai... they're super quiet on weekdays, even at prime time. So the ambience is slower paced and so enjoyable.

2012-07-16,4.0,"Mirai is exactly what it may seem to most. An expensive sushi spot where you can dish out your wallet and still not get enough... and that is the double edged sword my friends. I went there for a friends birthday a few weeks ago and my friends boyfriend decided to take it upon himself to order for everyone and choose what dishes were to come out and when. Most of the people attending didn't really know what's what so I understood his decision and while I did not really agree with this, I still enjoyed everything that I ate. The presentation makes everyone quickly pull out their phones. To be honest, I think I thoroughly remember how every serving looked. But not everything is as good as it looks, right? Well, not the case this time. The fish and cuts at Mirai are some of the best I've ever tasted. The salmon was some of the best I've ever tasted and that was only the begining. The spicy tuna tar tar was phenomenal and I had no problem eating up a good serving of it when everyone was hesitant to do so. A little spicy, yes but it's in the name and from a place like Mirai, I expect them to deliver and that's exactly what they did. I also salivated over each bite of the rather basic tuna tuna salmon but it was almost near perfection. The only thing I do regret not trying was the unagi (eel). I know people don't agree nor like eel whatsoever, I'm a big fan and I'm sure I wouldn't have been disappointed. Next time, I suppose. I also have to compliment the wait staff on their service. Our waiter was waiting on several people in our section upstairs but he was very tentative and almost always in sight and never too far. But I can understand why he would be more tentative to a large party, you know? In any case, he did a great job and even had their chef cut the birthday cake that was brought for the birthday girl. That gesture went a long way with me and we really appreciated it.  Now, the only reason why I have to give it 4 stars is because of the price. As most will agree, it's rather difficult to get completely full at a sushi place. I do recommend you enjoy what you're eating because you will not regret it. If you enjoy great food, you will not be disappointed... once you get past the bill of course. If you like good sushi and don't mind opening your wallet/purse for it, you should definitely give it a try. If you're not willing to, most wont knock you for it... I know I wouldn't... okay, maybe a little. Enjoi!",0.9963,0.767,0.175,0.057,0.5005524431995021
2012-07-16,3.0,"Last Friday evening I took my husband out for a special birthday dinner at Mirai. As I recently became self-employed making us a one-income family, this was a very big splurge for us. I have been several times and was always impressed with the service and incredibly fresh product. I'd been telling my husband for years that you don't know sushi until you've had Mirai, so only rating it 3 stars pains me. We sat upstairs, which I was hoping would be intimate and romantic. Instead, it was so loud we could hardly hear each other. The first floor would have been a better choice. The first half of our meal was impecable: tuna carpaccio salad, tuna tuna salmon, kani nigiri, otoro nigiri, and sweet hotate. Since it was a special occassion and we were still a little hungry, I encouraged my husband to order several more items.  This is where the meal turned sharply wrong. On the strong urging of a friend, we ordered two pieces of the uni nigiri. We had never had uni before and were not sure what to expect. The waiter did not say anything when we ordered or when it was delivered. My husband, being adventurous, was first to try. I knew immediately upon looking at his face that something was terribly wrong. He nearly gagged. Had we not been at such a nice place on such a special night, there is NO WAY he would have been able to force it down. I went ahead and took a small bite and had the same reaction. What we experienced was a piece that was so wattery it nearly squirted in our mouth like a gusher. One could forgive this if the piece did not taste like something that had rotted on the bottom of the ocean for twelve weeks before floating to the top and rotting in the sun for another twelve. We figured we had been steered wrong by a well meaning friend and that this is what uni tasted like.  Much to our dismay we waited until we left to do some research online and spoke with some friends who have had uni before. It seems that what we experienced was our of charachter for uni, and put simply just really bad uni. I'm shocked becuase Mirai has a reputation for being one of the (if not THE) best sushi places in Chicago with the freshest fish. We were able to laugh it off, but the rest of our meal just wasn't the same and there is now a scar on what was supposed to be a special occassion. We couldn't get the rotten uni taste out of our mouth and it made it even harder for me to swallow the $160 bill. The only saving grace, neither of us got sick.",0.9554,0.833,0.11,0.057,0.511959595959596

The place is cute, on a nice strip of division street. We started with a few appetizers and then moved onto Sushi. The shishito peppers are really good, and the tuna tartar was very very good, but spicy. For sushi, we had a few special rolls: veggie, zuke, and spicy mono. They were all very good, but every time the plate came out, I was disappointed by the number of pieces that we got at about $15+ per roll. Even the veggie roll!!! I don't know where they are flying their asparagus in from, but as delicious as the roll is, it is just not worth it. We got the mochi ice cream for dessert, which was good (except for the coffee flavor), but it was $14 for 5 mochi balls. I'd rather go to trader joe's and get basically the same thing for a quarter of the price. Both times I've been here, the bill has come to about $50 per person without drinks, before tax and tip. I'm fine splurging, but there are lots of other places I'd rather splurge where I'll leave feeling (1) full and (2) like I actually got my money's worth.

2012-04-13,4.0,"I went Mirai with high expectation, I was little bit disappointed, but it's because I had too high expectation. I work at one of the best sushi place in Chicago. So my expectation is high, and when I just look at fish laying down in a case at sushi bar, I could just tell it's fresh or not.  Even with photo of rolls, also I could tell. Certainly, I was satisfied with a quality of sashimi. I only been to two restaurant which satisfies me with sashimi; Blue Ocean, and Mirai. Definitely worth to give a shot if you know sushi and value sashimi. Rolls were ok. I had tuna tuna salmon roll. was too plain for me. I would rather have sushi or sashimi.  Staff were nice and knows what they have!(which is rare for sushi place, ironically) Definitely recommend for sashimi lovers.  Bit pricy,and smaller portion. But it's normal in Wicker park.  But still way better than Usagi ya or Blu Fin or Seadog.  Prepare yourself, spend 50$ per person, still not full though. So here's my advise on your choice of sushi joint in wicker park. 1. if you are looking for fancy, fine quality of sushi, for special occasion like date or birthday, don't mind spending much money :Try Mirai first. Then Sea Dog.  2. If you are looking for quick bite of sushi, reasonable price, don't care about quality service or time, :Try Blue Fin first(recommend spicy tuna, no sashimi) and then Nori on Milwaukee(Monday, 50% off) But still, I hear good things about Arami from sushi chef.

I'm talking BROWN all the way through - not just around the edges from sitting out during delivery. The rolls were sloppy and falling apart, and the $16 salmon roll was way too small and poorly constructed to justify that kind of price.  Also, I was surprised that they just threw in a few plastic packets of cheap soy sauce (like the kind you get from low-end chinese places), instead of sending a container of soy like most sushi restaurants do.

On the awesome side was the Kani Nigiri king crab dish, Shrimp Togarashi (hard to eat, but amazing seasonings) and the special salad of the day, which was a tuna carpaccio salad (although it was more like seared tuna - nowhere near thin enough to be classified as carpaccio, in my opinion).  On the mediocre to bad side, the Spicy Mono roll's octopus was nearly impossible to chew, and I didn't find the roll all that flavorful. And the Spicy Tar-Tar was blah blah blah fish mush. Ugh.

The rolls were rolled tight and small so you don't look completely vile stuffing in a roll too big for your mouth.

The other mark against this place is that they do NOT make rolls to order.  Once again, I have never been to a sushi place where they did not custom make sushi rolls.  I lived in the SF Bay Area and in the LA area and EVERYONE makes sushi rolls to order.

2011-02-18,3.0,"SP and I went to Mirai for the first time last night with a friend from out of town, and to sum it up in one word, I'd say we were quite underwhelmed. The food was decent, but neither the creativity of the rolls nor the quality of the fish lent itself to justifying the overall priciness. The menu itself is fairly limited, which isn't unusual in more traditional Japanese restaurants that focus on fresh, high quality ingredients as opposed to reinventing sushi, but we did not feel this was such a place.  The menu featured a few starters (really just two: edamame and shishito tempura, since I don't count seaweed or house salad as ""appetizers""), some hot plates from the kitchen (i..e, gyoza, agedashi tofu, teriyaki etc), soup and noodles, and maki/nigiri/sashimi selections. The makis are separated into Specialty, Traditional or Tempura Rolls, and in each category, there are only 6 or 7 choices. We tried four of the specialty rolls:  - Tuna Tuna Salmon - Unagi Trio - Special Zuke - Spicy Mono.    At $16 each, none of us felt that they were worth the price. Each roll was more or less the size of a regular roll, and the only thing that made it special was the fact that there was an extra piece of fish on top. Of the four, the Spicy Mono (spicy octopus topped with tuna) was my favorite whereas the guys favored the Tuna Tuna Salmon (which to me was really just a thin slice of tuna on top of a mini salmon rice ball). The Unagi Trio was really just an unagi roll topped with an extra piece of unagi and the Special Zuke was really just a shrimp tempura roll topped with a slice of fluke. For $64, we were not impressed (or full). We also tried some sashimi (4 pieces of Sake, 2 pieces of Chutoro and 2 pieces of Otoro) and ordered the Shishito (tempura battered peppers) as an appetizer. The sashimi was just ok. The pieces were small and too thinly-sliced (which in my opinion detracts from the ""mouthfeel"" of more luxurious fish such as salmon and tuna). $32 for 8 pieces of sashimi..still not impressed. Overall, the ambience was nice and the drink menu was surprisingly populous (it was the same size as the food menu, maybe bigger).

I would say some sort of dipping sauce, but this place kills everything with too much sauce so I am hesitant to suggest that. Shrimp Gyoza: Could barely taste the shrimp through the overpowering proportion of ponzu sauce and fried flavor. Chicken Togayashi: Ample portions. Although the seven spice sauce is good, with a nice little kick on the finish, the ingredients in the dish did little more than serve as a vessel for the sauce... I should have just asked for a seven spice soup. Tuna Tuna Salmon: I did not order this myself, but the one piece I did have was quite nice... for a designer roll.

The reality, like the hot girl once she washes the makeup off and ditches the WonderBra, ain't so pretty. Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't bad. But the waitress seemed like she couldn't be bothered and flat out refused to ask for anything off the menu. Ask for a hand roll and she refuses. Ask the chef to make whatever roll he feels like? She refuses. I've had sushi in NY, San Francisco and even Tokyo. Nowhere has a place said they won't make a hand roll. And to top it off, the server wasn't even apologetic about it.  Even worse, the prices were a bit out of whack. Nigiri is a solid buck or two more than a comparable place down the street on Division. House rolls are about 3 bucks more. Don't get me wrong. The sushi is good. The tuna tuna salmon roll is actually really tasty. But it never approached greatness. And at these prices, I'm expecting just that. There are cheaper places that are just as good a few blocks further down, and I have the option of heading south to Arami for cheaper prices, far better food and friendlier service.

Like that it's in my hood. 5 stars.  9:05pm - No reservation but snag a seat on the patio, enjoying the late summer evening weather. 5 stars, this is going well.  9:10pm - Reviewing menu, kind of pricey but decide on 2 Sapporo beers and edamame to start. Order 4 pieces tuna, 4 pieces salmon and a roll. If hungry, will order more. Server is friendly.  1/2 star deduction for price. 4  1/2 stars.  9:25pm - Unfamiliar server drops beer off, doesn't make eye contact or speak. Sort of peeved it took so long to get beer. 1 star deduction due to extreme thirst. 3  1/2 stars.  9:40pm - Still no sign of server or food. Where is the edamame?  1/2 star deduction due to hunger. 3 stars. 9:45pm - Server stops to see if we have gotten food. Must have seen us considering gnawing the table legs. When say no, server flails arms and says OMG. Slightly entertained by this reaction. Still 3 stars.  9:55pm - Wow. So hungry. Thankfully food finally arrives. From another server. Don't care about rotating servers, too focused on food. Not thinking about stars at this point, only food.  10:05pm - Hubs and I have inhaled food. Decent. The best? No and still hungry but want to leave. No sign of the edamame. 2  1/2 stars.  10:10pm - Server stops by to check in. We inquire about edamame. Flails arms again and runs off to retrieve. Finally receive edamame. Chow the little beans down. 2 stars.  10:15pm - Server brings check. Not happy with bill and quality of experience. Disappointed, still hungry and in need of beer. 1 star.  10:20pm - Go to restroom and relieved there is no line. Thoroughly impressed by sink and seemingly invisible drain. Report back to hubs. Hubs goes to restroom to see. Sink turns out to be most impressive point in meal. Redeems 1 star. 2 stars.  Final score: 2 stars for Mirai and 2 disappointed tummies for us.

We started off with a sashimi special of white fish.  The quality of this was outstanding, but for six pieces of albacore, halibut and jack, the $20 price tag seemed way too high.  It was good, but not something I'd drop a Jackson on.  Next, we ordered two of their ""simpler"" rolls - a single ingredient wrapped in seaweed and rice.  The rice was undercooked and fell off the roll, and the innards of the maki were skimpy.  Again, for the price, I felt cheated.  Our last roll of the night was a softshell crab special maki that came covered with fried pieces of crab, with a gigantic bowl of ponzu sauce in the middle.  The plate was huge, but when it came down to it, the roll only had 6 pieces.  Again, this is like a $20 roll.   After $90, my date and I were still hungry and kind of mad that we paid for such mediocre food.  The service was attentive, but when we told her we'd never been there before, she felt it necessary to explain the entire menu to us.  The ENTIRE MENU.  Very strange.

We had never been there before, so the waitress went through the menu with us and explained that alot of people who come in decide to share alot of the items, tapas style.  Because we all wanted different things, we decided to order seperately and we let the waitress know that. I ordered 2 appetizers as my entree, and asked the waitress if it was possible, if they could be brought out when everyone else's meal came out so we could all eat at the same time. She said no problem. 10 minutes later, my appetizers came out, and everyone else had no food. I mentioned to the food runner that i had asked to bring this out with everyone else's food. The waitress then came back and in a curt manner told us all that because we had decided not to share, none of our food would be coming out at the same time. Over the course of 2 hours, the food slowly rolled out and people ate in waves.  One friend, who had specifically asked if the particular sushi roll was spicy (she hates spicy), was told by the waitress it was not.  When it came, it had wasabi within the roll and spicy mayo that was not mentioned by the waitress or on the menu.

2010-07-17,5.0,"Damn. That sums up Mirai. I was surprised to learn that Mirai is owned by the Japonais people, as I'm not a huge fan of Japonais (the patio and downstairs area are very nice, however, at Japonais). Let's get it out of the way for any price snobs - Mirai is not cheap. But it is well worth it. The food here is very good. The fish is always fresh; the only other place that serves such consistently fresh fish is Kamehachi. As for the rolls? Well, I don't have much to say. The reason why is that they really don't specialize in rolls (although they always have offerings and they are terrific - end of story there). What they do specialize in are fantastic sashimi offerings. They serve a variety of tartares and sashimi and pair them excellently with spicy, sweet, and/or smoky flavors. I wish I could give you a bunch of examples of things to try, but the wonderful thing about Mirai is that they have a constantly evolving menu and they change things up quite often (which is good!). One item they usually do have is a tuna tartare dish with a quail egg on top. Ooooohhhh, man. Great stuff. Don't sleep on that if you attend Mirai. Lastly, Mirai does a Kamehachi-type thing in terms of ambiance (I'm not saying one place did it first - just giving an example in case anyone reading this has attended either place). The downstairs section of the restaurant is a little more traditional, with the sushi bar and sushi chefs visible. The upstairs is a flat-out lounge, with cool tables and a DJ. Like I said - I'm from south Florida, and I've experienced some ridiculous sushi down there.

Service was very good, with a very friendly greeting and goodbye by the host staff, and lots of suggestions from our server.  My only gripe was that I'd have liked a bit more of a lingering experience.  When I had roughly a sip left of my drink, I was interested in ordering another, but our server didn't notice, or wanted to turn the table...one or the other.   We were in and out in less than an hour, which made me a little sad since I was in the mood for a bit more lingering conversation. No matter, the sushi really is that good...we'll be back, I'm sure.  I might not even require a celebration reason. Nah.  I always require a celebration.  The reason for celebration only happens once in awhile.",0.9816,0.813,0.159,0.027,0.5301023391812866
2009-12-08,3.0,"I debated bumping this up to 4 stars, so I guess I'd actually put it at about 3.5, but I round down. First off, the food was great. OK, let me go back a little further. My lovely date and I needed a place to celebrate her good news. So, she loves sushi, I live right by here, she's been wanting to go for awhile. So Mirai it is. I got online and booked an 8PM reservation, at 5PM, no problem (Have to like OpenTable).  My date was running late, so I went in, told them she was late, and they showed me up to the bar to have a drink and wait. First off, Mirai is too different places. Down stairs is bright and busy. Upstairs, is dark and lounge-y. A few minutes later, the host came and got me, and showed me back down to my table where my lovely date was seated and waiting.  Our waitress was very nice and very friendly (and had an awesome pair of glasses). We started out with an order edemame, hot and salted. I ordered another kirin, and she ordered ""The Red One"" off their extensive drink list. We then ordered shashimi of fatty tuna, and yellow tail, both were amazing, fresh, and delicious. Then we had the rolls with King Crab meat (can't remember the name), and one with octopus. Both rolls were fantastic. So, 2 rolls, 4 pieces of Sashimi, and 2 drinks equals $70, plus tip.  So with very good food, and nice service, why only 3 stars? There was no wow factor. While I didn't feel rushed, we had 8 PM reservations (and remember, we didn't sit for awhile) and were still walking out the door before 9. Again, we never felt rushed, they didn't bring out everything at once, but little by little, but still, I just wasn't wow'd.",0.998,0.739,0.236,0.025,0.5362751322751323

While I don't remember thinking it was the greatest place on earth the other two times I visited, I do remember a better experience than last Tuesday night. First of all we sat downstairs. Do not sit downstairs. You might as well be at any corner sushi bar when you sit downstairs - bad ambiance. Secondly we had a coupon that my friend got at a benefit and it instructed us to present it at the beginning of the meal. This, understandably, threw our waitress for a loop but, come on, it's a coupon. She made it awkward enough that I felt the need to explain that we would tip on the original price. Perhaps not my classiest move, but whatever.  We started off with Lychee cocktails. Can't go wrong here. We moved on to the special sashimi, bin cho, and spicy mono. Loved the sashimi and spicy mono. I have nothing bad to say about the Bin Cho but after the waitress's gushing about it, I definitely did not taste the wow factor. Our second round we ordered Tuna Tuna Salmon and Yuke Toro. The Tuna Tuna Salmon that everyone has raved about was very unimpressive. The tuna sashimi on top, okay that was good. The salmon inside the roll was poached and tasted to me like it was out of a can. Where the other tuna was, I have no idea. The Yuke Toro tasted okay to me, but was very strange and not worth the plug the waiter gave it.  You stire up a quail egg into chopped tuna.  It's like eating slime.  My friend couldn't even eat it because of the consistency.   All in all, I was happy to have our coupon. We did have to ask our waitress to rerun our bill by the way because she ""forgot"" to add the coupon. I don't plan to revisit Mirai again.",0.9824,0.777,0.151,0.071,0.49499206349206354

Perhaps it wasn't such a bad thing after all as it appears my old sidekick has taken a toro turn in a direction that I'm less than tobiko thrilled with.  The seating in the upstairs lounge which was always intimate is now closer clustered than ever... I know they're trying to accommodate more customers, but at the loss of my personal space? No Thanks! I really don't need to be able to rub elbows with the girl next to me, or have nowhere to put my purse, coat and limbs... and lest me not forget to mention the servers and bussers that now can't get in between tables and are just constantly (and clumsily) reaching over the poor sap who got the outside seat in an awkward attempt to serve you. Talk about distracting.  Then, of course, that brings me to the food/service... they menu is stale. Not much has changed in years except for perhaps the quality. Loose rolls, uninspired pairings and for the first time ever at Mirai I couldn't muscle down the rolls placed in front of me, they were just... bad.

The service was alright.  I went on a Saturday night with my brother and wound up spending $50-60 each without drinks with tip; therefore I thought it was garbage when I asked for hot green tea and they brought me a tea bag and some hot water for me to prepare the tea myself (which wasn't that satisfying).  (You would think such an ""upscale"" place would want to exert more control over their product anyway).  I also thought the note on the menu saying that the dishes come out in no particular order (to be more creative or something) sounds more like, ""we don't want to put the effort into timing the courses for your meal because we're just too lazy."" The problem with this place is that it tries to be fancier than it actually is.  When dining here I understand that I'm not at the Ritz or Le Francais; they should probably come to the same realization. If you go, the ambiance is lovely and the food okay (nothing really notable); but you'll be paying more than you should be.",0.8292,0.895,0.074,0.031,0.5247767857142858

The sushi was good, but definitely not worth the price. Mirai seems like a place for the sushi novice, as most of the specials are basic rolls covered in sauces that drown out the fresh fish flavors. There weren't many staples on the menu (rainbow roll, anyone?) and the rolls they did have (spicy tuna, salmon) were bland. If you are looking for flavorful fish without the flare, this is not the place to go.  The one thing that Mirai doesn't mess around with are the martinis. While I was craving nigori sake, they only offer full bottles, so I unhappily settled on the sake martini. I was pleasantly surprised, as it is served with slices of cucumber and is extremely refreshing on a 90 degree day!  Once again, the only way to describe Mirai is ""meh.""

If anything, avoid the maki and come here for their fresh sashimi selection.  At $16 for a specialty roll, it's a bit of a rip off. My husband and I started with the tuna tar tar which was no more than a tablespoon in size for $9.  It was mushy and frankly, not very exciting.  I was much like tuna tartare (in the style that is scraped with a knife rather then cubed) and then ponzu sauce poured into it and a fancy quail egg on top to offer some color.  We should have ordered the Tuna Tuna Salmon appetizer dish instead. Then we had the mono maki - highly recommended by our waiter.  The maki itself was fun and tasty but highly disappointed that the rice fell off as I tried to pick up the roll with my chopsticks.

Finally to polish off the evening, we ordered a nice variety of sashimi -  I really liked their sashimi selection because there are a number of fish that you don't see in conventional Chicago Japanese restaurants: Blue fin akami tuna (lean); Blue fin otoro (really fatty); kona kompachi - all the fish were traditionally sliced (I can tell that behind the bar is a real sushi chef just from the way the fish was prepared).  Also had Uni - which sometimes can be a hit or miss for me but my husband and I both agreed that it was delicious here! After $160 spent (no dessert, but we had 3 bottles of hot sake and some cocktails) - I was till hungry.

2009-06-18,2.0,"Wow. Seriously? My girlfriend and I took a trip to Mirai, and from the Yelp reviews, I expected something great. Unfortunately, it was one of the worst meals I've had in an extremely long time. The two stars are there only because one of our four rolls was above average. First, Mirai is trying to be a level of hip that it just isn't. Valet parking? Really? This isn't downtown, there's enough street parking for everyone through the week and even most weekends. Then we met our server. Oh, boy. Our server not only informed us outright that Mirai is the ""best sushi restaurant in town, that's why I work here,"" but the proceeded to list the most popular items for us. Are you kidding me? I didn't come to your restaurant to find out what other people like, I came to eat what I like. Further, I am fully capable of reading for myself. Isn't the rest of your clientele?  After feeling vaguely insulted and more than a little like I was having rice hard sold to me by a fabulous but self-centered gay man, I attempted to read my menu in peace. Unfortunately, I couldn't, because our server then decided the best method to push his sushi was to show us everything that was coming out for his other tables before serving it to them. Not only is that awkward (I don't want food people I don't know have been breathing/coughing/whatever on), but it kept us from ACTUALLY choosing what WE wanted. The server had no regard for our own tastes, only what he thought we should want.  We finally ordered two green teas, miso soup, age dashi tofu, an eel and avocado roll (because they're too good to call it a dragon roll at Mirai, in fact, many of their specialties are generic rolls from other places with different names), a potato tempera roll, a shitake mushroom roll, and an avocado roll. This order is low on the fish because I'm a vegetarian who humors her fish eating partner. The tea came in tea bags. Quite frankly, I was more than a little disappointed, since I haven't been in ANY Asian, much less Japanese restaurant that didn't use loose leaf in almost 10 years. No one uses bagged teas in restaurants anymore because of the poor quality of most bagged types. The miso was passable though the tofu in it was of an odd consistency.  According to my partner, the eel and avocado roll was excellent. Both the shitake and avocado rolls were okay, not bad but nothing to write home about, either. The potato tempura roll was miserable. In other restaurants, tempura rolls have always included some kind of sauce, be it spicy or sweet. This had nothing. It was straight potatoes, batter, and rice. It was utterly bland.  Finally, several minutes after we finished everything else, my age dashi tofu arrived. I was immediately suspicious. Age dashi has been vegetarian at 99 percent of the restaurants I've been to; only once have I come across a place that used bonito in their sauce. Something here was really wrong. It tasted fishy, the batter was chewy instead of crisp, I felt weird eating it and something from it stuck in my throat. I am certain that the tofu was battered in something other than just panko crumbs and I think it was bonito. So my meal was not only awful tasting, but not vegetarian friendly, either. As a side, the portions of wasabi with their rolls are near non-existant; anyone who loves the spicy flavor best ask for extra. After we ordered, our server was suddenly and miraculously out of our faces. That's great, except when he doesn't notice you've finished and you sit there for an extra 15 minutes with fish flakes in your throat. All in all, a miserable outing at Mirai.",0.9875,0.779,0.128,0.092,0.5692910465062364

Their dishes are inventive and unique.  For drinks, I highly recommend the cucumber martini (which is half off on Sundays -$5.50)  Their miso soup is incredible.  I don't know if its the cooked tofu, lots of scallions but the taste is pure delish!  I highly recommend the choturo with quail egg appetizer.  One of the staff of Mirai applauded us for getting this appetizer but told us how much he loved it and he knew that we would enjoy it too!  Its really good! We also decided to have some basic rolls, but basic at Mirai is some kind of awesomeness!  We had salmon avocado and yellowtail rolls.  I think what I like about Mirai's rolls so much is that they are so fresh and artfully prepared and thats so evident in their presentation to diners. The food is great here and I will most definitely be back! Yum, yum!",0.9947,0.79,0.21,0.0,0.5136781609195402
2009-05-30,4.0,"When I go to a sushi place these days, I'm generally looking for maki, the more creative the better (Banana? BBQ sauce? Mozzarella cheese? Yes please!) Mirai was a delight because it goes beyond creative maki to rethinking how Japanese and Japanese-inspired food should be served and eaten. They do have entrees, sushi and maki, but much of their menu is devoted to what is best described as ""Tapas, Japanese-style"" - small appetizer-like plates meant to be shared. We tried as many things as we could eat (and afford, place isn't for the budget-conscious), and everything was quite good. Standouts included the Yukke Toro(spicy fatty tuna tar-tar with raw quail egg and ""chef's"" special sauce), Kani Nigiri (spicy baked king crab nigiri-style, one of their most popular items and an incredible little packet of flavor) and my favorite, the Kimo (monk fish foie gras wrapped in octopus). Monkfish liver is mild but still something of an acquired taste, but I've acquired it and I eat it whenever I find it. I have only rarely found good octopus, but the octopus here was just the right firmness and a good complement to the monkfish liver's custardy smoothness. Also good were the tempura, the udon soup, the goma ae, and the unusual and flavorful teriyaki chicken. We finished off with mochi: mango, strawberry, and a a delightfully smooth red bean. Definitely warrants a return visit to try the rest of the menu. My friends also had Cucumber Passion martinis, which I sipped and vowed to try next time. Just be prepared to drop half a yard (aka a quintuple sawbuck). It may be pricy but we were suprisingly full given the small portions, so I have no complaints.  I guess my only beef is: what kind of a fancy-schmancy Japanese restaurant serves you green tea as a pot of hot water and a teabag?",0.9964,0.767,0.205,0.028,0.5646336996336997

I encourage you to focus on the repeating words in the menu. I won the evening's unspoken, but clearly present, ordering competition with my ""Tuna Tuna Salmon"" selection. The waiter talked me out of Yaki Yaki (or something like that), which I feel would have been another sure winner. The weirdest thing about Marai is the decor. Holly described it as ""modern"".

From Cincinnati,OH (which does have some great sushi joints) to Chicago for the past four years... I know my sushi! I know good food and I am quite picky when it comes to wether or not something tastes how it should. At Marai I tasted Sea Urchin for the first time tonight. Pleasantly surprised with how fresh and beautifully creamy the texture was, I am convinced that it is because of the quality of fish that this restaurant serves. Having read the previous reviews, stating a unanimous vote of Marai having the best quality sushi and the most creative rolls in Chicago... I have to say I agree! Amazing Otoro, Sweet Hotate Entree and great big mochi to finish, I was in heaven. The price was up there but totally worth for the quality received. The service was also excellent! Which is extremely important when dining with such importantly special food. We got a table for six in a flash on a Friday at nine o'clock. Our server Gabby was super knowledgeable and right on with her recommendations. The sake that she chose by the glass was one of the highlights of my night.

2009-05-08,4.0,"In my, the restaurant's, and the Chicago sushi scene's younger and more vulnerable years, Mirai was the crossing-the-rubicon moment that got me prepped for Katsu, for Yasuda, for the high temples of sushidom. That was 2001, however, and as the trendoids descended with their disgusting maki rolls and saketinis, this troll snuck back to his cave and hoped that the ""sushi"" moment would meet an inglorious end.  Yeah, you saw how that worked out. Flash forward to my return--it has been at least seven years, I figure--and my trepidation: a little more learned, a little more elitist, I steeled for disappointment. Yet what I found was the Diane Keaton of Chicago sushi joints--a little aged but still surprisingly sexy. Take that, Rev. Moon's fish delivery service! So we run it old-school style (in order): -Otoro sashimi (2 slices/$12) -Sakatana carpaccio ($12) -Nigiri (snapper, soy-marinated sake, raw ebi, a salted unagi, uni, and something else I can't remember) ($ = do the math) -Monkfish liver wrapped in octopus ($8) -A veggie maki mono composed of asparagus, squash, sweet potato, and spring peas ($15) You'll forgive the following familiar language: the otoro, once a shot of citrus hit it, came alive with its luxuriant fattiness; the snapper and shrimp were beautifully cut and had that exquisite clarity that great sushi possesses; the carpaccio--the one-time favorite dish of my former wee lad self--is still a textural treat, with the slickness of the sesame oil, the salt hit of the soy, and those cute capers all buttoning up together. The unagi was sneaky: the first impression was of the frozen salted mackeral you get at H-Mart, but it opened up into this vivid sensation that I lack the lexicon to articulate--really awesome, though (sorry!). But the uni--oh, the uni. More nutty than briny, the urchin just echoed and echoed and echoed on the tongue like endless reverberation from a gong. You see why people fall back on the word ""unctuous"" when describing this stuff. Presumably, the kimo would be better with fluke, which they were out of (they were out of a lot of things, actually); as it happened, the pairing of octopus and monkfish liver was rubbery and without much flavor to fall back on--no funk in this trunk. The veggie mono was a pleasant palate cleanser, its simple vegetal flavors evoking spring and bringing closure to our meal; I just didn't get the fried enoki mushrooms on the side, which proved somethings are NOT better fried. Shocking, but true. The heart races a little less now. Yes, it's more expensive than a neighborhood sushi restaurant--but not enough to be a reason not to go. Yes, service can be erratic--but I wouldn't call the help snobby. Worth the hassle, methinks, for fish that competes with Katsu and Itto for the best in town.",0.9969,0.789,0.166,0.045,0.5275069597069597

First of all- the service.  Our server couldn't have been more helpful especially when he found out that we had never been there before.  He took the time to explain the menu and to call out some things that we may not find in other sushi places. We ordered a wide range of sushi- from fatty tuna nigiri (like butter in my mouth) to several specialty rolls.  I loved the pacing of the service.  They took a look at everything we ordered and then proceeded to bring it out individually so we had time to savor one before the next arrived.   And this place was FAST!  I don't think I've ever been to a sushi place where the food comes up so quickly that the tempura products are still hot but the roll is still cool.  Perfection. While Mirai might be a smidge more expensive than my neighborhood sushi place- it is worth the price.  Valet parking is also available if you drive as parking is a hassle along this stretch of Division.

2009-03-14,5.0,"The thing that really sets Mirai apart from other sushi in Chicago is the quality of fish. The nigiri pieces rivaled those I've eaten on the West Coast. It's one thing to eat Chicago sushi rolls that basically translate to sushi candy, and then there is quality fish. Whereas you eat the fish alone and that stands up as a complex tasty morsel alone on it's own.  Spicy Mono is hands down the best bite of sushi my husband has ever tasted next to a piece of unagi nigiri in Santa Barbara and Konami's Treasure at Yoko's in Portland, OR.  So that says a lot.  We were able to eat at Mirai thanks to our one year anniversary dinner treated by my Dad. We simply thought we couldn't afford it on our own. Well the thing is it can happen.

Spicy mono with spicy tuna atop octopus in a roll.  And I continue...  The best part was that as I was eating my last piece of spicy mono, trying to savor each second before it enters my system never to be heard from again, my step-mom is grilling me about my graduate school plans, or lack thereof, and my husband is trying to explain our future to my father and is beautifully fielding inquiries of how to deal with such liability disasters as drunk Slovenians falling off of our dream patio and who is responsible in that situation for the obvious incoming lawsuit.

Where do I start? Mirai has the best sashimi in all Chicago? It's so fresh and delicate. It doesn't compare at all with Sushi Samba. My boyfriend doesn't like sushi and absolutely hates it when I drag him to Japanese restaurants. I made him try the sashimi here and he was like wow - this is good. From that moment on I made him try each and every piece of sashimi on the platter with me. Did I just convert a non-sushi eater to a sushi lover? How I love fatty fatty fish!  So in addition to the sushi platter we did order from the restaurant week menu. The spicy mono and tuna tuna salmon indeed are fantastic rolls. The butterfly shrimp and seared scallops are amazing as well. The scallops weren't huge but tasty. We chose to replace the dessert mochi (2 pieces) included in the restaurant week menu with cocktails and then ordering the mochi again separately. Tip: You save money this way. If you keep the mochi as your dessert for the 3-course meal and order a cocktail ($11) on the side you actually spend more. The peach sake sangria is very yummy. It contains moscato in it so for you ladies who love moscato you'll love this drink.

And for heaven's sake why can't i make enough money to eat you every week?!  This is one of those reviews i wish that Yelp would let me give 4.5 stars to a place. Mirai definitely deserves it - just off from Perfect! It's hard to offer suggestions on what to eat here, b/c everything is great. Last time i went, my date and I ate Omakase (the sushi selection is left to the discretion of the chef). And i was 100% amazed and satisfied with every piece they brought out. I don't know if we maybe got some combination plates that wouldn't normally have been offered, but the choice of fish and the order at which they were served was close to perfection. I also love how they integrate their spicy sauce into their roles. It never interferes with the taste of the fish, but yet somehow just first hits your tongue the moment before you swallow. It acts as a subtle after note, as opposed to the bold ""hide the poor quality of the fish"" center-stage it may take at cheaper places.  Service was very attentive and on target - except toward the end of the night when many people had already left, i felt like the help checked out with them.  If you do dine here, make sure you get reservations for the upstairs lounge. The ambiance is many times better than downstairs and will make the evening. I would also suggest to get a nice bottle of sake instead of the mixed drinks. They are just too sugary and i don't feel that they complement sushi well.

The atmosphere was what we expected. We opted for the ""lounge"" area upstairs, and were lucky enough to get the two arm chairs by the door. A little drafty, but nice none the less. The setup was perfect for conversation...initially (got loud later). Only one complaint. I read this in one of the earlier reviews, and thought it was very strange that it happened to us too.

2009-02-19,4.0,"Oh Mirai Sushi, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways. Last night was my first foray into the world that Mirai calls ""sushi"". I came, I saw, I ate ... I froze to death in the slush falling out of the sky like so many kamikazes on the way to the car. Who doesn't love February in Chicago? But I digress. The infamous hostess I've read about was immediately disarmed by my smiling and friendly face. She gave us a table on the first floor in the corner by the window. I had nothing to complain about. The waitress, Elizabeth, came quickly and we walked through the specials and the menu and I fumbled with the sake menu. We wanted sake. We needed sake. Serenity now! Sake now! Unfortunately the middle-ground sake was sold out (note to self: it must be good! Seek it out!) so we moved to a sake redolent of ""cedar"" and ""butter"". Uh, ok ... But then it started to make sense to me, especially as we would no doubt be having some of the fattier fish, like tuna and salmon which would work if cooked on a cedar plank and add their own ""buttery-ness"" to the ""butter"" of the sake. Then I started thinking ""Ah! Marketing!""  We quickly and deftly ordered a variety of the special fish including 2 of the grades of available tuna and 2 each of different Japanese white fish, including a relative of red snapper and the other of yellow tail. It didn't take long for the beautifully and generously cut nigiri to the table. Nor did it take long to inhale it, as much as we tried to savor it. Here is where I think Mirai wins: perfectly cooked sushi meshi (rice} and fish delivered on said sushi meshi at the perfect temperature: almost room temperature, but not quite; warm enough to allow the flavor of the fish to shine, but cool enough to feel safe and to prevent it from turning. Between bites we moved immediately to ordering maki. Based wholly on recommendations by fellow sushi lovers here on Yelp, first up was the Tuna Tuna Rainbow Maki. Soft, lux and tasty, the roll was wonderful but a textural contrast beyond the daikon and tobiko might have been nice. I had to try the Spicy Octopus maki too, based, again, on recommendations here and by the waitress. I found the sweetness to be very surprising especially compared to how dark and deep the sauces looked. By now there was no stopping us and we moved to a special maki with almost invisible fluke atop roll stuffed with crab and a ponzu dipping sauce. The sauce really brought something out in the roll and truly made the dish. After the North Carolina fluke I was in sushi heaven. My brain was vibrating and I started to understand the meaning of life and started scratching statistical math problems into the veneer of the table top. I do recall having another roll, a surprisingly delicious tempura shrimp (perfectly cooked to golden brown) stuffed into a roll and top with salmon and a ""spicy wasabi sauce"" that was not unlike a Big Mac Special Sauce combined with Honey Mustard. No, seriously, and I do mean that has a compliment. The service was anything but slow and even when the waitress promised to pace the rolls, we hadn't yet finished one when a second arrived. She kept the sake flowing though and really, that's what mattered. The bus boys, like many sushi places I patron, are ""quick to clear"". I suppose I understand that maybe they are making way for the next dish, but if you still see pickled ginger on my plate ... let alone any piece of nigiri or lump of maki ... don't touch it. Thank you. I think Sushi Wabi is MUCH cooler in terms of atmosphere. I just love the room at SW and while I appreciated the clean lines of Mirai, it felt a little like a cafeteria.

2009-02-17,4.0,It's always better when your wallet stays in your pocket. This place is definitely on the more costly side for sushi. I went with a group of co-workers for some client meeting. The table was really nice and we had plenty of room in the upstairs area. The drink list had some original signature drinks that were both good and bad. I'm usually fine sticking to a Sapporo but decided to try some new things based on the payment situation. If I need to get my sushi fix I tend to go to other places. Good for a special occasion though.,0.9127,0.796,0.171,0.034,0.584803391053391
2009-02-16,4.0,"I had heard good things about Mirai, so we decided to give it a try.  The best part of our meal was the tuna we started off with.  Other than that, we had a few of their special maki rolls, and a few standbys as well.  The food was all excellent - extremely fresh and very high quality. I was a little annoyed at how slow they brought everything out.  They only brought out one roll at a time, which is fine, but there was literally a 10-15 min. lag between every serving.  The same with our drinks.  Ordering a beer or glass of wine meant you would receive it in about 20 min.   Overall - great sushi spot!",0.9133,0.802,0.159,0.039,0.48961344537815127
2009-02-14,5.0,"So there were some mixed reviews that gave me pause, but my fiance and I went with another couple last night.  In short, everything was perfect. From the start, walking in, the hostess I met and dealt with was very nice.  (I did see later the ""cold one"" mentioned kind of sulking about, but ours was very gracious and helpful) We sat and the waitress went through a very nice and thorough run through the menu.  She was helpful and patient.  We never felt rushed or ignored.  She made some recommendations and they were all good. Food. Great.  I made my party try the monkfish liver wrapped in octopus, for the sole reason that is one of those items that seemed unique to Mirai.  Very good.  Both the liver and octopus were fresh tasting and the combo with the chive was very good. Their other house special was the king crab/lemon maki.  We got that at the waitresses recommendation and again, delish.  Not a typical sushi combo, but great flavor!  I would definitely recommenced that. Finally we ended up re-ordering another of the shrimp tempura/salmon/sake marinade maki.  This roll was like a sushi popper.  Very tasty and you get the fun texture from the crunchy shrimp in the middle.   Finally, my own sadistic test for any sushi place is to try the uni (sea urchin).  When it's good, it's an unbelievable experience, like the ocean melting in your mouth.  When it's not good, it's a torture to swallow and a challenge not to spit it out.  I always ask for how fresh it is, and smart wait staff and sushi chefs will admit that it is not.  The waitress at Mirai assured me, ""if there is one place to order it, it's here!""  I'd give it a 9 out of 10.  Taste: very good, slight, and I mean just slight off-taste, but definitely good. The presentation was a bit odd , I was expecting nigiri, but it came out more like a maki.  Not the end of the world but usually I like it as nigiri, without tasting nori (as it was stated on the menu) . Anyhow, bottom line the 4 of us had a very pleasant time, and when it came to bill time, it was not too insane.  About what I'd expect to pay for a night of really good sushi and a bottle of wine.

They usually have some delicious appetizer specials too.  As for the ambiance, I prefer dining upstairs. It's more of a lounge-type atmosphere.

2009-01-03,3.0,"i think my high expectations for mirai have led to this three-star rating. i was so excited to try it because i've heard great things and i love sushi.  i ordered the seaweed/cucumber salad (i think it's called the kaiso salad at mirai), otoro (fatty tuna) sashimi and the unagi trio roll. first of all, the seaweed salad was great. the seaweed was not at all fishy and had that great, not too slimy texture and delicious flavor. as for the fatty tuna, i'll say a few things... as i've mentioned in another review, i typically judge a sushi restaurant by the sashimi because it's pretty hard to mask bad or even not-quite-so-fresh fish when it's on its own, without any sauces or tempura batter. i've eaten a lot of sashimi (including tuna) but have never had otoro, so when i saw it as a special on the menu and the waitress confirmed the 'melt-in-your-mouth' quality, i was super excited and decided to splurge despite the price. i ate my first bite, and it was super cold, almost to the point of seeming frozen. i know sushi should be cold-ish, but this was so cold that i think it may have ruined the texture. the fish seemed kind of grainy and definitely did not melt in my mouth. on the plus side, there was absolutely no hint of a fishy taste, so my suspicion is that it perhaps shouldn't have been stored at such a low temperature.  the unagi roll was pretty good but had so much sauce that it wouldn't stay together and i found a bone (or is it cartilage in this case?) in the eel. as i said, i had such high hopes for mirai because i've heard it's one of the best (if not the best) sushi restaurant in chicago. i'm not one to give up though, so i may give it a second chance in hopes that it will redeem itself.  good to eat: seaweed/cucumber salad",0.9943,0.772,0.181,0.047,0.6107832080200502

I would describe the maki as below average.  I didn't have any sahimi or nigiri save for one wasabi tobiko nigiri which I will say was one of the better things I tasted.  The crowd I was with was more of a maki group, which typically is fine with me, and we were doing the whole communal eating thing.  Every roll was either nasty (oddly textured fish anyone?), minute or bland.  Even the fresh wasabi lacked any oomph.  It was obviously grated some time ago.    Let me make it very clear, I'm not a sushi amateur.  I'm not a ""chad"" that decided to eat sushi when it became popular.  I've been going at it for some time and I'm unreserved about making a pig out of myself.  I love fresh, high quality, raw fish and inventive rolls containing said fish.  At Mirai, I preferred the edamame over nearly anything else.  Other than the aforementioned wasabi tobiko, the only other thing that really did it for me was the ""Spicy Mono"".  It was tasty.  It didn't knock my socks off, but it was tasty.  The yellow tail scallion was tiny (think diameter of a sharpie fine point) and lacked any flavor whatsoever.  ""Yukke Toro"" might have been better if fresher tuna was used and more inventive way to serve it was employed.  Gelatinous tuna with a quails egg isn't easy to eat with chopsticks.  Now that I think back, we did have something called ""Kani Nigiri"" and it was so-so.  Too much citrus that covered up what flavor was to be found in the crab. Every tiny portion was interrupted by a 10-15 minute pause from the kitchen.  Our server was really nice but, even if the food had been good, the kitchen's snail pace would have ruined the experience.    Do yourself a favor and go get real sushi somewhere and leave this place behind.  Coast comes to mind, Butterfly has awful service but their food is quite good, even the all you can eat sushi at Ringo tops the quality at Mirai.  And it's $22.",0.7856,0.852,0.087,0.061,0.5260576923076923

At this point both the rice filled rolls and sparse maki selection combined with the absurd prices it was easy to say our dinner was pretty much a wash.  I know this is harsh but the rolls honestly looked like something you could pick up at your local grocery store :( There are so MANY great sushi places in Chicago that cost about half as much and serve better quality rolls so forewarning, if you LOVE Maki Rolls this is not the place to go... unless you feel like spending about $60 a person on white rice :)",0.9879,0.813,0.157,0.03,0.5921626984126984

I ate at Mirai's numerous times, especially on special occasions and have always loved the sushi and service.  HOWEVER this past weekend a few of my friends (My BF, 2 friends from out of town and another couple, one who had a BDAY) ate their on a Saturday night.  We had a reservation at 8:30pm and they seated us downstairs (We have always eaten upstairs with a beautiful view and great service) . So here is where is starts: We sat down at about 8:30pm and we did not have a waiter approach us for 15 minutes. When he finally came, he took our food and drink order and another 15 minutes, my miso soup came.  Eventually our drinks FINALLY CAME BUT our food did not. I thin the drinks should ALWAYS come first.  When the first sushi order came to the table, it was wrong so we sent it back. When they came back with the corrected order, it was wrong again. Throughout a period of about 1 1/2 hours our sushi came sporadically so we were not able to eat and enjoy the food together.  One of the couple had to end up leaving b/c we been there almost 2 hours now. The waiter NEVER came back to see how we were doing NOR did he ask us if we wanted more drinks. Clearly we wanted more drinks as we were celebrating a BDAY and our Friends were here from out of town. Eventually we got fed up and talked to the waiter about the poor service.  He had absolutely no empathy for the service but eventually he came back way later and said he was going to get you another round of drinks on the house for the service.  As we were waiting we continued to be angry about the entire situation so we escalated it to the manager.  We really felt as though the restaurant was under new management b/c we never had this type of service there before.  The manager was empathetic and listened to our issue but it took her about 30 minutes to come to the table with some type of compensation for the horrible service.  She finally came back with 2 HUGE pieces of cake and said this is on the house and we are sorry.  By then we were very upset and just wanted to go so we denied the desserts.  Then our bill came and  what do you know, the ""FREE"" round of drinks were added to the bill and the sushi that they messed up on was doubled charged. ERRRRGGGG - at this point, my friend and I went up to the manager and expressed our anger about the bill. All in all they were able to adjust it.  We left and said we would never go back. Its a shame b/c the sushi is spectacular but the service needs a change.

Okay, fine, but don't be so rude and act like you're job is the most miserable place on earth. So we lead ourselves upstairs and we are seating in a dark corner. Its really loud, and we can't really hear each other. I know its a lounge type area but it was still only 5:30pm. Our waiter was fine, and we ordered some things, and they came out fast. HOWEVER...... It doesn't say anywhere on the menu, ""We add gross amounts of wasabi to every roll, so much so that you cannot even taste the fish. You could be eating dog shit roll in seaweed and the wasabi is so much, you'd never know"" I personally hate wasabi, and I think it's shitty of a place to have seemingly ""plain"" maki rolls on their menu, only to have ingredients in them that you don't know about. Good thing I am only completely repulsed by wasabi, and not deathly allergic. So yes, Mirai, you ruined my dinner because you put wasabi in my salmon maki, my tempura potato maki, and my yellowtail and scallion maki... you also ruined our special roll we were going to share, the salmon zuke, that sounded so amazing on paper, but yet was taking a bath in wasabi cream.  People rave about your flavors, what flavor? I was too busy gagging and chugging water to notice if I was eating sushi or not.  82 dollars later, I left extremely annoyed, and extremely hungry, because I had them throw my entire dinner away.  *I was nice of our waiter though, after I told him I can't eat wasabi, and I was upset it wasn't noted on the menu that it was in everything, that he came by a bunch of times and watched me eat nothing all night and then asked me if I wanted it to go..

Then I came back. What is it with me and Chicago sushi places?  Have they all conspired against me to subject me to shoddy service and questionable food?  I need to get to the bottom of this.  My friends and I had reservations for a late dinner - 9 pm.  We thought making a later reservation would allow us to have easier access to tables, etc.  We arrive on time and the hostess informs us that the table isn't ready and that we can wait upstairs.  Fine.  Thus began the Seinfeld episode.   The upstairs back was jammed packed.  There was no where to move, sit, grab a drink, drink a drink, pee, blink, what have you.  Five minutes passed, then ten, then twenty....Seeing that I was slowly turning into the Incredible Hulk, my friends tracked down the upstairs host/manager and asked about the wait time.  He said, ""a couple of minutes.""  AT 10:45,  we were seated.  Yes, we should have left.  Yes, I should have burned the place down and danced on its smoldering embers.  But I was tired and weakened from my hungered state.  I wasn't in full form. We finally get a table and I am starving.  The host/manager 'apologizes' for the wait and gives us a piece of edamame to share.  Between 5 people.  If I had strength, I would have poked him in the Adam's Apple.  The wispy waiter comes to take our order.  After perusing the menu, I ask him what comes with mayo.  I hate mayo.  It's digusting.  The idea of putting globby white fat on raw fish turns my stomach.  How is this appetizing?  It's akin to putting melted swiss cheese on raw fish...and we all know how that story ends.  I ask wispy waiter three times about the food choice.  Besides myself, another one of my friends hates mayo.  We don't want to eat it.  We certainly don't want to pay big prices for eating it. [Sidebar: Santino from Project Runway was there that night and his tendrils of long, greasy hair were alive with power (Newports!) and choking everyone around him.   And he had Grinch teeth.] The food finally comes.  And as the last plate is placed in front of us, wispy waiter says ""Some of these have mayo in them.  Enjoy.""  With my last bit of strength and with RAW EMOTION, I grabbed on to his shirt before he scampered away.  ""What did you say?""  ""What?""  ""Did you just say there's mayo in this food?""  ""Yeah.""  ""Man, I asked you THREE times if what we ordered had mayo and, if so, to tell us and we would order something else."" ""You did?""   I blacked out. I came to and I was throttling the waiter and the cops were called.  Okay, maybe not. Weakened by hunger and disgust, I implored my friends to get the manager/host.  I explain the situation over and over.  He begrudgingly apologizes.  He says that he'll give us free dessert and comp us 40% of the bill.  At this point, I'm, like, ""Whatever.  At least my friends will get a break.""  As hungry as I was, I refused to eat.  I had my rage to keep me fed.  Then the manager comes back and claims that we'd ""already gotten a break with the appetizer, so there would be no more comps.""  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!  I waited over two hours to eat NOTHING and you're CHARGING ME FOR THIS?  Completely unacceptable.  Even my laid back friends were annoyed by this turn of events.  How does the manager change his mind to the detriment of his customers AFTER telling them that he'd handle the situation?

I haven't had rolls this good anywhere. These aren't your bland tempura crab or spicy tuna rolls, each roll is a work of art (and is priced so ~$15).

2007-11-09,4.0,"Mirai was possibly the best and freshest sushi I've had to date in Chicago.  The venue itself was cute - small enough to be intimate and busy enough to seem ""happening"".  The decor was just enough - not overly superfluous but definitely nice and not looking like your corner sushi joint.  Service was great (had a small mixup, but server apologized and took care of it), altho from a business standpoint, this place had way too many employees for the amount of seats.  I don't have too much to add to what's already been said.  Yes, the sushi is amazing, lot of it was melt-in-your-mouth quality.  Yes, be prepared to give up your firstborn child - j/k maybe just the stub of your pinky toe.  Yes, it's a great date place.  Only caution is that there isn't that much to the menu - I feel like I could probably eat all the ""special"" dishes in 2 visits.  Not to say that I wouldn't repeat, but it'd be hard to mix it up here unless I was strictly coming for the fresh fish!  Oh, word of advice - go early! Many of the so-called specials pushed by the chef were out when i went on a late Thursday evening, including the Kani nigiri and the aji sashimi.  I imagine this place blows up on weekends. But, on to my usual review of dishes tried: Hirame Usuzukuri - might be the only thing I didn't really like, tasted slightly fishy and didn't have the texture I like for my hirame, perhaps it's because it was of North Carolina variety TunaTunaSalmon Special maki - interesting creation...i don't know where the salmon was! recommended to be eaten w/o soy sauce Sakana Carpacio - tuna, salmon, whitefish were the 3 choices of fish we made since we were getting an octopus maki...sauce was tasty! Spicy Mono Special Maki - probably my favorite roll that night, a bit salty, but the octopus was quality Gyoza Ravioli - tasted a little bit like some sort of Chinese dumpling, but had fresh scallions inside Yaki Yaki - might be the least impressive dish.  was basically grilled squid and shrimp arranged symmetrically atop some asparagus.  squid was yummy, but shrimp was kinda whatever Atlantic sake nigiri, Otoro - melts in your mouth!

All of it was absolutely amazing.  I highly recommend the Peach/Passion Martini. It was so smooth, I didn't even notice how quickly I finished it.

We were very promptly seated upstairs in the lounge which is what reviewers recommended. We should of sat downstairs, and what really saved us was our wonderful and very attentive waitress. We are from CA, and I don't know what the rules are here in IL but you can't smoke in ANY public establishment.

2007-10-28,4.0,"Mirai was a pleasant and wonderful treat in my Chicago weekend.  Our dinner began fairly early so we had no trouble snagging prime real estate at the bar, which seems hard to do after 7:30 on a weekend.   However, unlike traditional sushi places, sitting at the bar doesn't differ drastically from sitting at a table in Mirai, since all orders are brought out by the waiters on individual plates and not simply bestowed unto you by the chef's skilled hands.  This is a mixed blessing - you don't get special treats thrown your way but it allows for much more aesthetically pleasing presentations. Speaking of which, our favorite course of the night was a brilliant whole Aji, filleted before our eyes and served sashimi-style beside the carcas to which it was so recently attached.  Other highlights included Ika in Uni sauce, NegiToro tartare, and simply unbelievable ankimo.  Downsides?  Not many...the sake list is well sourced but fairly brief and the fish, while very fresh and incredibly tasty, is not quite five-star caliber.  To be fair, though, the price is more than fair for the quality of the fish and in San Francisco, it would be a downright bargain.  I eagerly look forward to my next Chicago excursion!",0.9884,0.79,0.182,0.028,0.570970695970696

2007-04-12,5.0,"I have been a sushi fanatic for over 20 years and practically grew up at Kamehachi (back when it was on Welles north of North Ave.).  Until Mirai, a good sushi dinner was about fresh fish, a good atmosphere and good company.  No more.  Mirai has RUINED the standard nigiri-sushi experience for me permanently. My first experience with Mirai was on a bad date.  We waited at the bar upstairs for a seat at the sushi bar downstairs and I had my first taste of chilled sake.  I was impressed at their sake selection and had never thought of this wine like other wines before (during a later visit I explored this more with a sake flight at the bar).  I really liked the loungy atmosphere and the cool trip-hop and trance music they were playing.  It felt very Manhattan.   At the sushi bar my date asked the sushi chef to select our meal, presenting us with his freshest special concoctions of the evening.  I had no idea what I was eating (my date wouldn't tell me until I put it in my mouth;-)) but it was all good.  It was too bad I couldn't say the same thing about my date, but I forgot all about the seeming lack in his charm when I popped a piece of spicy octopus roll in my mouth.  OMG!!!  Talk about an explosion of flavors.   This being my date's only express request from the chef, I figured he MUST have SOME redeeming qualities.  So I went on a 2nd date with him...this time Chinese delivery at his house...NIGHTMARE! But at least these bad date experiences introduced me to my favorite sushi place anywhere.  I've attempted to find any place that rivals it and haven't: in Chicago, NY, Vegas, and (surprise!) Hawaii. I eventually took my (now) husband and it is one of our favorite places to go for a nice dinner.  We ALWAYS sit upstairs, preferably in the window seat or side-by-side at one of the low banquette tables.  It's cozy and intimate and a special treat on a night when we can watch the snow flying outside.  He knows that no matter what is wrong with me, how blue or affected with S.A.D. I am, a Bin Cho Salad, spicy octopus roll and a big bottle of sake at Mirai will always refresh my perspective on the world (not to mention get him laid!).",0.9084,0.815,0.111,0.074,0.5114880952380954
2007-04-06,5.0,"If you enjoy sushi and have been to Japan, then perhaps you'll agree with me that it's a good news/bad news experience.  Good news: Life-changing incredible sushi is everywhere, and if you get some at the Tsukiji wholesale fish market in Tokyo, you will achieve total blissful happiness.  Bad news: For the rest of your life, sushi in the United States, especially the Midwest, will smell fishy and taste like utter crap in comparison. So, a few years ago when I got back from a trip to Japan, I started looking for genuinely good and interesting sushi that would somehow remind me of that Tokyo experience.  Some Japanese colleagues suggested Mirai, and to them I owe my undying gratitude, because this place more than any other recreates that experience. If you've only had sushi in the U.S., you will be tempted to dive right into some familiar items, like simple nigiri, sashimi and California rolls.  STOP!  I will make you the same deal I make friends that I take to Mirai, order two appetizers or entrees to split, and then if you still absolutely *must* have that spicy tuna roll, get it then.  But try some interesting sushi dishes first, and I bet you'll stick with the left side of the menu and leave the happy dragon cream cheese explosion drowned-in-soy-sauce-to-make-it-edible rolls to the other fine establishments all over town.  Not that there's anything wrong with that kind of food... but if generic American sushi fare is what you're after, you're in the wrong place.  It'd be like coming to a fine steak house looking for a burger; you'd think it's a good burger, maybe even better than other places, but also probably think your local pub or even McDonald's was a better value. The left side of Mirai's menu is made up of mostly unique modern sushi creations, plus a few very traditional classic Japanese dishes that are not often seen in America.  If it's your very first time, I suggest you start with two specific dishes to really get the idea of Mirai; first, get the Bin Cho--marinated baby tuna with arugala.  Don't add soy sauce, as the chef has dressed it in a light citrus dressing, and get a little bit of every ingredient on the plate in each bite.  Notice that the tuna is not that strange ice-cold texture you get around town in other places, but that it's amazingly fresh and appears to literally melt in your mouth, and the other flavors don't hide the tuna, but instead compliment it.  THIS is the experience of sushi in Tokyo while never leaving Chicago.  Second, get the Spicy Mono--a maki roll with spicy octopus on the inside and spicy tuna on the outside with a sweet unagi sauce.  Again, skip the soy sauce, and just savor the flavor.  Then, ask for recommendations and order whatever sounds interesting on the left side of the menu.  You will not regret it.  My other favorites include the Spicy Tar-tar (I like the octopus and tuna mix), Kani Nigiri (baked crab nigiri-style), Special Zuke (shrimp and soy-marinated salmon maki mono roll), Unagi Trio (unagi and avocado maki mono roll), Tuna Tuna Salmon (poached salmon with tuna and wasabi mayo on the outside maki mono roll), and the fully non-sushi Yaki Yaki (grilled shrimp and squid in garlic sake sauce). My other recommendation is that I actually don't like the downstairs restaurant atmosphere very much, it has the look of generic urban bright sushi place.  I prefer the upstairs modern and playful decor, low lighting and funky music, especially the lounge area for dates.  On a crowded night though, the second floor can get a bit smoky since the bar is also there.  Speaking of the bar, it has some unique crowd-pleasing martinis, although they are a bit on the sweet side.  Sadly, the only tart martini that was my favorite has disappeared from the menu, the ""Blue Lemonake"" made with lemon vodka, sake and blue Curacao in a sugared-rim martini glass, but they still make it when I ask for it although I usually have to explain it to the server. And all without the transpacific flight hassle!  ;)",0.9976,0.825,0.144,0.031,0.4530668934240364
2007-03-31,2.0,"I honestly don't understand what the hype is all about.  When it comes to Mexican food, no I am no an expert, but Japanese food and sushi? Definitely.  As a food critic Japanese cuisine is my expertise. I'm visiting out of town from Los Angeles.  I use Yelp as my resource as usual to check out the local favorites.  I search for a good sushi bar as usual and see that Mirai has over 45 reviews, reviewers claiming the fish is fresh, fantastic and melt-in-your-mouth buttery.   I eagerly go on a friday and am disappointed at the fish selection first of all and am shocked at how high they're charging for the sashimi and nigiri, and even the udon.  I'm sorry but no bowl of Japanese noodles is worth $14/bowl.  And what the heck is $5 for one piece of nigiri??  Sushi should come out standard two pieces.  I look around and see people having to order 3 or 4 orders of the same thing, which means they're paying about $20 for 4 pieces of sushi.   I have to agree, yes the fish is buttery, but it is not worth $5 a measly piece. Ridiculous.   We ordered the tuna combination (3 pieces of fatty tuna, medium fatty tuna, and regular blue fin tuna, each.  $23), tuna rolls, california rolls , gyoza dumplings, house salad, asparagus wrapped in kobe beef ($15), and an order of the fresh wasabi ($1.50).   I enjoyed the tuna combination, but I liked the tuna rolls the best.  I would have been VERY disappointed if they messed up a tuna roll (oh and it has been done before at previous restaurants I've been to).   The california rolls were on the bland side and uninteresting, the kobe beef was tiring after the initial bite or two, the house salad was the typical greens with a ginger salad dressing, gyoza dumplings were okay except the inside looked more like a fish patty. Now I'm not going as far as being snooty saying that Chicago sushi sucks b/c I know there are good ones out there, but this being one of the most popular, does not live up to the hype.  I've paid for quality sushi and I sure as hell don't whine about cost when it's worth it.   What exactly are people paying for here?  The atmosphere? The flat wash basin in the bathroom?  It's definitely not the slow service.  I've been to over 100 sushi bars and this is one of the rare occasions I'm utterly confused. In particular detail, heir entrees feel more like appetizers, their service is SLOW (4 sushi chefs and it takes 30 minutes to cut 3 pieces of sushi???).  The atmosphere is loud.  Even the valet is ridiculous; $10?  C'mon people it's $5.25 at most, even in the swankiest Beverly Hills restaurant in LA! There a couple positives.  Besides the fact that the fatty tuna is about 5 bucks a piece, it is buttery.  The proportion of rice:fish for nigiri is a little off.  There's more fish than rice.  It would make more sense to make 2 smaller pieces of nigiri.  At least it creates the illusion you're getting more bang for your buck.  As for desserts, the mochi dessert is fantastic; it is just the right soft consistency.  It definitely gets the fishy taste out of your mouth after a round of sushi. Well I think it's no surprise, but I shall not be going back, and since people think Japonais is a comparable Japanese restaurant, I don't think I shall be visiting there either.  Plus the hype about that place is just over the top.",0.9956,0.766,0.157,0.077,0.4650665696556107

At some sushi places, you feel like you can't ask a question or you'll look stupid). They have a delicious king crab roll and I absolutely love the green tea custard dessert. It comes with a little glass of chocolate sauce and you can use as much as you want on your custard. Yum!",0.8856,0.805,0.143,0.053,0.6863636363636364

2006-04-21,4.0,"Best Sushi in Chicago (period).  Need not repeat ""melts in your mouth,"" but I did anyway.  Their sushi and sashimi selection always pushes the boundries, but in the right direction, challenging your taste buds with every bite.  See when you eat really good food, you start to sound smarter too!  Alas, I cannot afford to eat at Mirai regularly, but if you are on an expense account, its the place to go to impress your clients (wink, wink).",0.9358,0.781,0.189,0.03,0.5589481946624805
2006-04-13,4.0,"So, I'm into Japanese food, and for my birthday last year I wanted to try a new so-called Best Japanese restaurant. So I dive into my Zagat guide like everyone else and there it is, Mirai Sushi. So we finally get to go, and it was early summer late spring, and we dined out on the patio, that was quite nice. The atmosphere is very nice, upscale, Hip. There defiantly was a younger crowd here than I expected. If I recall the only Japanese person I saw, was the Sushi chef that we met. Very skilled guy. An Artiste   It was a while ago so my recount isn't so vivid, but I know everything was great, and I enjoyed it very much. I think for the four of us we spent about $400 on dinner, we order everything. It was a great birthday, but I don't think it impressed me enough to venture that far on my own. What can I say, I'm spoiled! Then again maybe it's time for a second visit!  Cheers!",0.9796,0.822,0.16,0.018,0.5223543123543123
2006-02-26,4.0,One of the original high-end sushi joints in Chicago. Still one of the best with an eye towards keeping pure flavors. You will not find crazy rolls here and you won't miss them.,0.8393,0.744,0.256,0.0,0.6125
2006-02-21,4.0,"When you hear people raving about Mirai, they aren't pulling your chain.  There is a reason that the place is always packed and you better make a reservation.  Mirai is one of my absolute favorite sushi restaurants in Chicago, and I consider it a treat to visit this Wicker Park hot spot.  I love sitting upstairs and people watching yet downstairs offers a front seat view to the sushi bar and extremely attentive service.  Although it is pricey here, I really believe it is worth every penny.  I've never had better Ikura than that which I've tasted at Mirai.  Try to save room for their Mochi dessert too!",0.9642,0.817,0.183,0.0,0.5549999999999999
2006-01-01,5.0,"The best sushi in chicago.  It is pricey but definitely worth it.  They have outdoor seating in the summer which is great.  Out of any of the places i've been to in chicago, Mirai definitely tops them all.",0.9724,0.591,0.409,0.0,0.4125
