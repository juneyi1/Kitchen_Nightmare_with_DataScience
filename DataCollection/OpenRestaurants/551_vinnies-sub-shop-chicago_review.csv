I'm so glad they left their subs in the fridge so I could find out where they got them from. After trying to figure out when I was going to get over there to taste a sub I finally got an opportunity to go during my lunch break today. I couldn't decide between the vinny and the Italian. I asked the lady at the counter and she recommended the vinny. So glad I went with her suggestion. The sun was so fresh and full of flavor. The sesame seed bun kind of scared me but it made the sandwich unique and added another layer of flavor.

I have been driving by Vinnie's for years and stopping by Bari's for all my sandwiches. I won't be driving by much any longer. From the moment you walk in, you get that unique neighborhood treatment that immediately created a bind between homely local joint and dedicated loyal customer.  Treatment that to be honest is not part if the Bari experience at all. The lady running the place could not have been nicer. It's ""hon"" this, hon that from when you walk in to when you leave. I felt like I was buying a sandwich from my favorite Aunt's sandwich shop. She explains the menu perfectly, in detail and in a way that really helps. They cater and deliver. I got the Vinnie's Special and it was humongous, loaded, fresh,delicious.

2013-07-22,4.0,"It doesn't happen often, but there are times when I just don't feel like cooking dinner. It happens even less often that I want a sub for dinner. Last Saturday, both of these rare phenomena did indeed occur, and this is where Vinnie's delivered. Well, not delivered as in ""brought to my house,"" but delivered as in ""filled the void"" and ""hit a home run."" After it was deemed that I wasn't cooking, I decided to pick up some viddles for dinner, make some tasty cocktails, and have an impromptu picnic across the street from my house. I headed to Vinnie's after I remembered reading such glowing reviews.  This unassuming little sandwich shop on Grand Avenue is fantastic. There's a huge variety of subs, available in two sizes: a nine inch or a twelve inch. Unless you're ravenous, a nine inch should suffice. There's plenty of options--all kinds of meats and cheeses, and lots of choices for vegetarians as well. In order to try as many as possible, I asked for a tuna salad, smoked turkey/provolone, and a 'capri,' which had fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil. Sandwiches are made fresh to order (obviously) and can be customized with the de-rigeur toppings of lettuce, tomatoes, oil and vinegar, onion, pickles, mustard/mayo, and seasonings. And for a small upcharge, they have premium add-ons like artichoke hearts, eggplant, or pesto mayo. And because my fiancé feels that no picnic is complete without potato salad, I grabbed a side of that as well. I was on my way in no time. Three nine-inch subs and the potato salad came in at around $17. Wow, that may be the least amount I've ever spent on food for a picnic. The highest price here for a sandwich is only $6.75, and that's for a twelve incher. You can't even buy the ingredients at the grocery store to make one for less money. This is cheap eats heaven! But of course, cheap means nothing if the food's not good, and this food was GREAT. Super-fresh ingredients, perfectly crusty bread, and just the right amount of well-balanced fillings. I also liked that they didn't use a heavy hand with the condiments. These sandwiches were damn near ideal. The potato salad on the other hand, was forgettable. I'd bet a million dollars it came from a five-gallon drum; completely mediocre and not worth the calories. Skip it, and go straight for their delicious sandwiches.

Both use bread from the local bakery D'Amatos (right down the street on Grand).  For some reason though, Bari's bread seems to have a crispier crust, which is the way I actually prefer it.  Both seemed to put the same ingredients in the sandwich.  However, Bari's sandwich has more bite, in terms of flavor and spiciness.  The hot from Vinnie's barely registered.  I wasn't sure I actually had any giardiniera until I checked.  I ended up adding some of Bari's super-hot giardiniera to my sandwich.   Prices are pretty much the same ($5 for a 9"" italian sub). One thing Vinnie's has over Bari is customer service.  It's not that Bari isn't friendly, it's just that Vinnie's is super friendly.   Yes, Vinnie's is friendlier, but in my mind, Bari still makes a superior sandwich.",0.744,0.89,0.066,0.044,0.44720303506017783

However, the bottom line is that even if the sandwiches sucked here (which they don't at all), I would still patronize Vinnie's because of the owner.  Dar is one of the most pleasant women I've ever interacted with - one of those old school, neighborhood broads that calls everyone ""honey"" and recognizes you on the street when she sees you.  Seeing Dar every day was one of the things that made me look forward to going to work every morning, and I'm just glad I still live in the neighborhood so I can see her from time to time.",0.9783,0.821,0.15,0.028,0.6863668430335097

The owner is an absolute sweet heart and the food is great.  The pricing is similar to Bari and so is the product. Absolutely try it here.  Nicest owner on the planet and a great sub to boot. Skip the stupid line at Bari, let them dispense sour attitude to someone else, and give Vinnie's a try.  It's worth it.",0.9607,0.667,0.24,0.093,0.6183760683760684

2008-03-31,5.0,"""What can I getcha sweetie?"" That sums up this place perfectly. Vinnie's is a great neighborhood sandwich shop that never forgot it's a neghborhood sandwich shop. The woman who takes your order talks to you as if you've been coming there for years. The sandwiches are large and very cheap. The bread has always been fresh and the variety of sandwich options is great. I have never been disappointed and am a little afraid if more people find out, it'll get crowded. Forget what I said. You never heard of Vinnie's. Vinnie's is my place I tell ya!",0.9489,0.814,0.168,0.018,0.6988571428571428
2008-02-12,5.0,"My wife and I absolutely love this place.  While its neighbor, the Bari Market, garners all the attention, this place is as good, and yet, remains off the radar for the most part. I cannot speak to all of their sandwiches because I always get the large Vinnie's Special [comes on french, instead of the sesame].  However, the portions are just right and the taste is phenomenal. Where Vinnies is a step above: the service.   You will always be greeted with a smile and a kind word.  The people who run the shop are genuinely nice and will do whatever they can to make sure your experience is pleasant. There is not much inside seating to speak of, so ordering to go may be your best bet during the winter months.  In the summer, they have a small patio out front with 3-4 tables. Even though we've moved out of the neighborhood, we will continue to frequent Vinnies.  In this day and age, its a rarity to find a place with good service, good food, and good prices.",0.9894,0.798,0.202,0.0,0.5091080876795162
2008-01-22,5.0,"i had intended to go to this place for about 2 years now. i finally stopped in after a hard day's work in my studio. i was greeted by the sweetest woman who called her customers ""sweetie"" or ""hon"" or something (and managed to NOT sound obnoxious in the process - she was endearing!)  i ordered the fresh mozzarella, tomato and basil sandwich, to eat there. it's just a tiny store front, but there is a table in the window with about four chairs. the bread was scrumptious, the mozzarella was dead fresh and the basil yum yum! they have coke products on fountain (thumbs up) and several other drink options. highly recommended for anyone in need of a quick, delicious bite. quick note about their hours: they aren't posted. it seems they stay open as long as the bread lasts - my guess is you'll want to get there before 5 pm. oh, and subs come in 9"" and 12"" - didn't see any 6"" on the menu...",0.8564,0.826,0.114,0.06,0.5097916666666666

2007-04-15,4.0,Solid sub shop.  I really love hitting this joint for lunch and do so all the time.  The subs are great and very reasonably priced.  The staff is great and the whole experience reinforces the great neighborhood vibe going on.  I like the tuna sub - not super oniony.,0.9568,0.619,0.331,0.05,0.5995833333333334

2006-08-23,4.0,"I am so happy to have discovered Vinnie's! Since I moved to Chicago 4 years ago I've been desperately searching for a good sub. Vinnie's is the place. . . big sandwiches with plenty of meat and cheese (no skimpy Subway portions here) on yummy crusty bread. . . and cheap! A 6"" turkey and cheese is under $4! And the staff is so nice! I was there yesterday and the man and woman (the owners?) who were there were real chatty, but in an honestly friendly way, like they really wanted to know how my day was. and the 12"" sub I got for f$6 or so fed me for 2 days.
