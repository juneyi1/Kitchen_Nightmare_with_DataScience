Tomorrow is another long day of work in the summer sun. I walked into this place and ordered my coffee and headed to the bathroom. I was caught by a sign that advertised bacon cookies, They were thin with a wide circumference and they looked good. While in the bathroom - I hatched a plan to purchase many cookies for coworkers who share fondness for bacon. The cookies are $3.00 each. I asked if I could get a deal if I bought 5 cookies. The counterman said $13.00. Fair enough. I was inappropriately excited at the idea of a bacon cookie. It has been a while since I have been to Chinatown for a good old pork cookie - so this seemed like it might fit the bill. I paid for my ice coffee and my 5 cookies and walked out the door. I slowly unwrapped my cookie and bit into it. I waited for the bacon flavor to overcome my senses. There was none. I took another bite - and another - and - much to my chagrin - there was no bacon in the cookie. They didn't even use bacon flavoring. They may as well have cancelled Christmas.  Then I did the math in my head. Either they didn't give me the deal after all - or their ice coffee costs $4.00. That is strike two,. You only get two strikes in the game of bacon cookies and ice coffee. Five cookies and a 12 ounce ice coffee (plus a buck tip) $19.00. I gave the cookies away. They were boring and free of bacon.

2015-06-06,2.0,"I'm with Mary T.   I really love a good bagel and cream cheese (as a shiksa I feel I need permission to use the word shmear).  It's kind of an indulgence for me, so I try to choose wisely.  Today I'd penciled one in for after a few errands in the Fifth Circle of the Bermuda Triangle - you know, the shopping nightmare bordered roughly by North, Kingsbury, Clybourn and Sheffield.  Which isn't even a triangle, I know.  Disorienting.       So, the good news is, I parked right in front of CBA.  But then things got a little less awesome.  The ordering is a little disorganized and I am not sure the menu actually includes what I wanted, which was not a sandwich, nothing special, just a bagel and cc.  So therefore I didn't know the price.  But I placed my order and then stood aside.  For a while.  The employees were hustling, it just took a while for some reason.   So, fast forward.  Strike one: my toasted bagel was barely toasted.  After all that time, which I assumed was due to the toasting.  Strike two: the plain cream cheese had elements of other people's sandwiches.  Such as a lox-y smell, colors such as yellow, a couple very small shards of onion and at least two one-inch pieces of shredded lettuce.  One of those got stuck in my teeth.  TMI but I am making a point.  Either utensils or prep areas need some attention between orders.   Strike three is that the iced tea tasted pretty off.  Either too old or too strong, I don't know, but it was unpleasant.  I'd asked for fountain iced tea and believe it's homemade, which is cool, it just didn't taste right.  They were doing a two-for-one on Arizona bottles so if you are a tea drinker, go that route.  You are welcome. My order totaled just south of five dollars, which I felt was a little steep.  And they offer homemade rice krispie treats, which are my kryptonite, but not for $2.50.  Dem some Lincoln Park prices, yo.

I read comments below for people who didn't rate 5 stars. 1 complaint was ordering process. CBA has an app and online ordering which would help those people that must have structure in their lives.

Chicago Bagel Authority is a gem for having delicious, quality ingredients served fast to hungry customers who want a quick bite.  On my first visit, I was met by the smell of delicious meat. It's alarming how large their menu is, but since corned beef is a bit harder to come by, I chose the bread intruder. It's a mini meat monstrosity with the corned beef, egg, and bacon taking up about 2/3 the size of the sandwich. The corned beef is served hot and fresh while the bacon is a bit crunchy but matched with a satisfying chew.   Chicago Bagel Authority is quality! Only thing unsatisfying is the price one has to pay for a bagel sandwich--about $7-9.

My three star rating stems primarily from the food.  I believe that my dissatisfaction was due to the sandwhich I ordered.  It was sort of bland and it seemed to me that the sandwhich was 90% bagel and 10% toppings - shouldn't there be more toppings?  I liked the concept of a steamed bagel, but the rest of the sandwhich didn't wow me.  I wasn't a fan of paying $8 for a sandwhich, but if it was freaking amazing I wouldn't have blinked an eye.   I would definitely be willing to go back and order something different and if it's amazing then I will give this place the rating it deserves.",0.9482,0.77,0.139,0.09,0.6463333333333334

Unique combinations of awesome bagel goodness, but once you find one you love (which will likely be the very first one you try) it'll be tough to actually order anything else. Seriously, I think I've tried 3 and I never have the guts to order anything else because choosing between those three that i'm obsessed with is already tough enough.

2015-03-31,4.0,Sandwiches always taste better on bagels. Especially the gourmet sandwiches at CBA. They have a great variety of sandwiches and I love how they separate their menu based on the main meat or vegetable. The bialy bagel is less dense than a normal bagel and does not have a hole in the middle making it easier to eat. They also steam the sandwiches instead of toasting them which I believe to be better at bringing out the flavors in the sandwich. Have always loved every sandwich I've ever gotten at CBA. Also their chili is so on point and it's available year round.  The staff is extremely friendly and talkative to customers which is a pleasant surprise. Only reason CBA isn't getting 5 stars is because of being slightly overpriced for what is essentially a deli sandwich.,0.9829,0.802,0.198,0.0,0.5254901960784315

The reason for the 4 stars is the way this shop runs. You just kind of have to stand there and make eye contact with a sandwich maker to place your order.

Check in and you get a rice krispies- not as great as the one at Noodles and Co. but it was a perfect dessert treat.  This can be a family place too during the day. It's a great little lunch spot right by the Armitage el- so it's convinient. The guys that work in there seem busy and distracted- but they are kind. I'm glad I got to try it out. It was delicious- but I may want to pick a more quieter lunch spot next time that isn't so rushed.,0.9944,0.71,0.249,0.041,0.6215419501133788

I'm still not sure what ""steamed sandwich"" really means for their bagels (more than the obvious connotation), but whatever it is, it makes for the best bagel sandwiches I've had. I always get the Dirty Swede, which is just darn delicious, and usually pick a random other sandwich. Most recently I got Sara's Secret, which has avocado, sprouts, and a healthy dose of mustard on it. I was not disappointed. They invent new sandwiches quite often (such as the Ron Swanson, which has just about every type of meat imaginable on it) and it's worth looking around the store for new suggestions (if you look at the board behind the counter you'll understand what I mean).  A small story about the Ron Swanson - I was at the Music Box theater with some friends watching ""Someone Up There Likes Me,"" a new film with Nick Offerman. There was a Q&A afterwards with Nick Offerman, and someone asked whether he'd heard of the ""CBA."" He said no, and then the questioner asked if he would appreciate the Ron Swanson sandwich. Nick looked extremely skeptical and asked what was on it. As he asked this, someone started shouting from the back of the theater - apparently he was the guy who invented the sandwich. Immediately the emcee went over to this inventor and had him describe the sandwich to Nick. He detailed the ingredients, and it seemed, to me, at least, that Nick approved completely.   I've usually gone here for a late lunch and never had much of a wait to order. The wait for food is usually 5-10 minutes, so don't think of this as instant gratification on grabbing a sandwich. That said, the small wait is completely worth it. Also,  I've only ordered off the main menu - which is plentiful already - and have always been quite happy.

There is no line, which I was highly confused about because I didn't know who to order to, if I was cutting anybody, or when I had to pay. I placed my order to the line cook, the only guy who seemed to be taking orders. I have no idea how he remembered all the orders he was making, but he was working very quickly and pumping out the sandwiches at an impressive rate. But it still took a very long time for me to get my sandwich. So it was obvious he was cooking a huge amount of sandwiches by himself without any of the other workers' help. I then walked into the line to pay, and got no number. So now I was just waiting for the single line cook to yell out my sandwich. Which was a bit disconcerting because I imagined other people also ordered my sandwich so how in the world could we decide who's he made first? After waiting 15 mins for my sandwich, I finally got my Durty Swede sandwich. This was my first venture into steamed bagel sandwiches so I didn't know what to expect. It was delicious. The meat was freshly sliced, the cheese beautifuly melted, and overall I was impressed with the quality.

I double checked to make sure it was not expired, that I was entering the correct numbers, etc. After multiple tries, the coupon was still not working.

Let me break it down: Bagels that are steamed are strange...but strangely delicious!  This place gets my vote and my business mainly  because of the plentiful toppings and accoutrements and combinations each sandwich offers.  Give me a turkey on a steamed onion bagel with some chive cream cheese, cucumbers, sprouts, lettuce, tomato and mayo.

2012-12-14,5.0,"Seeking sustenance on a Sunday morning in Lincoln Park, I turned to Yelp and found Chicago Bagel Authority. Wow! I'm so glad I did. This place is a bagel and sandwich lover's dream! I arrived early, about 9:30, and the place was relatively quiet. It was bigger than I expected - the narrow storefront belies a deep restaurant with lots of tables. The atmosphere was great, brick walls lined with lots of local and sports memorabilia and a casual, local vibe pervades the place. As a first time visitor, it's very easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer size of the menu board at this place (I know I was!) so I'd suggest a quick perusal of their website or skimming some Yelp reviews before heading over. The staff was very helpful and chatty, offering suggestions and they even were willing to customize a sandwich for me. In the end, I chose the Hangover Helper (scrambled eggs, American cheese, and cheddar on an egg bagel). Funny name, and an even better sandwich. This was my first steamed bagel and I really enjoyed it! It was chewy, but not overly so, and had a nice fresh flavor to it. The Hangover Helper lived up to its name, piled high with egg, cheese, and ham, with just the right amount of grease to smooth it all down. I rounded it all out with a Nantucket Nectar and the meal was absolute breakfast perfection. By the time I was done with my sandwich, I decided to grab another sandwich to go for my lunch in an attempt avoid the food desert that is Midway airport. The second best decision I made all day (the first was visiting CBA in the first place)! By this time, I had had enough time to ogle the menu which made my decision a little bit easier, but not by much. The sheer variety of sandwiches on the menu is amazing, and everyone from dedicated carnivores to strict vegetarians can find something to enjoy. I liked how the menu is sorted by the type of meat, it makes it a little bit easier to narrow down what you're looking for. Most of the combinations sounded so interesting and put the average tired sub shop offerings to shame, I had a hard time deciding! The names are kind of silly (the Cosby, Chicago Fire, anyone?) but I understand that's because patrons can create their own sandwich and name it after they've managed to try every sandwich on the menu. Cute gimmick. If I lived here, I know I'd probably make it around to trying every sandwich on the menu eventually!  I chose the Messy Katie (turkey, cream cheese, colby, lettuce, tomato, sprouts, avocado, and honey mustard) and asked for it on an egg bagel instead of a bialy. The Messy Katie certainly lived up to its name (do not eat in mixed company), but that didn't make it any less delicious! The combination of ingredients was unique and tasty. I loved the turkey and cream cheese combo and the avocado and sprouts complemented it nicely. Yum! I decided to treat myself with a golden grahams rice krispie treat (thanks Yelp check-in!). I'd never had one before, and it was very delicious - a nice spin on an old favorite. I wish there were more independent, awesome sandwich joints like this. Their friendly staff and dedication to serving up a hearty, creative sandwich in a fun atmosphere is something every business should strive for. CBA, please move to my neighborhood!

2012-11-17,4.0,"I was at the Crate & Barrel Outlet with a girlfriend a few Sundays ago and we were starving. I pulled up my Yelp app and started searching. Within moments, I knew that we had to wander over to the Chicago Bagel Authority. It was a short walk and as we arrived, before we opened the door, I could smell that we were at the right place.  CBA has a pretty narrow storefront with maybe ten to twelve tables along the front window and side wall. The staff weren't really interested in helping us wade through the giant wall menu which was a bit of a disappointment since we were the only ones ordering at the time.  My girlfriend ordered a plain bagel with butter. I went down a completely different road and ordered the Cookie Monster. We grabbed a pretzel chocolate chip cookie, a bacon chocolate chip cookie, a Rice Krispie treat (free with Yelp check-in) and a couple drinks.  Paying at the register proved simple and when I turned around, I saw that things had changed drastically.  We had walked in at just the right time because there had been no wait and now the people were packed in like sardines. Where did they come from?  Is there a second entrance?  Wow! We snagged a table, waited for our bagels and munched on our cookies. The wait was a bit longer than I anticipated for a couple bagels, but it was tolerable thanks to the best bacon chocolate chip cookie I've ever had. Don't look a me like that...I've had bacon chocolate chip cookies before. And believe it or not, I've even made a batch or two in my day. CBA's were so much better!  The bacon is chopped into little pieces, there is a ton of it and the cookie had the right crispy/chewy balance.  When our bagels were ready, I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't read the description as carefully as I should have and found a blueberry bagel loaded with cream cheese, cookie dough and maybe some chocolate sauce. It was the most delicious mess I can remember eating in recent history!  Weird, but good. I don't usually order cream cheese on a toasted bagel because I don't like the cream cheese to get warm. This was just right the way it was.  I'm glad that I didn't mess with perfection.  The only reasons for four rather than five stars are that the staff were kinda just there and weren't very pleasant and the tables were not cleaned off.

Order a bagel with peanut butter on it and you get hot peanut butter. Hot turkey, hot jelly, hot whatever. Some things are great hot. Sprouts are not.   And, not steaming is not an option because then their bagels practically bounce. They have to be steamed. I just don't like them always steamed.

Just went to CBA  for the last time today... Ordered a sandwich for my little one (not steamed and without sprouts/ he's allergic) the lady( with dark braided hair)  behind the counter asked me my order which I  correctly stated to her--- 15 minutes later I get a hot sandwich w/ sprouts... I nicely alert her to the mistake and she says you didn't tell me.. Which I did... She makes me another sandwich on the wrong bread w/ sprouts.... I alert her again and she refuses to fix it!!!!!! While she tells my 5 year old that he needs to just eat it.... And that I am a difficult customer... I honestly thought this women was going to deck me! But I did over pay for this mini bagel nightmare ( $12 for a tiny turkey bagel/ one drink and a bag of chips) so I would like my child to be able to eat it the way I ordered it??? ..... Last time I visited I got yelled at because I requested no hair in my sandwich..... I feel like cba is that bratty/ entitled child who won't go to rehab and I am the enabling relative who keeps giving them my money.... I even forgave them after they ripped off everyone (including me!) and wouldn't honor their groupon deal.... I alerted management via facebook and they tried to blame me ( LOL)..... Anyone wanting a bagel in the lin.park area I suggest you go to Einstein bagels across the street from cba.. They're extremely nice ( the bagels are a lot fresher! And you get a lot more food for your $...) Cba I would like to get all the tips back that I have given you....

The ingredients were perfectly proportioned, with no skimping or careless excess.  I agree with other reviewers that the service is on the slow side--I waited probably 10 minutes as other people, who had ordered well before I arrived and took my sweet time deciding what to order, got their bagels. This was around 3pm, so it's probably worse during actual lunch time. And the menu is daunting, but I think that is a positive, rather than a negative attribute; they probably have whatever you're in the mood for, including apples and peanut butter on a bagel, or apples and cheese, or something with sauerkraut.

The problem is the ordering process and the customer service.  Even if I'm the only one in there, it often takes fifteen minutes to get one bagel sandwich.  (Fifteen minutes to make a bagel sandwich?)  The workers behind the counter are usually doing hipster things, standing off to the side, talking among themselves, and every now and then they seem to remember they are at work and should be making my food.   Worse is when there is a crowd.  There is no rhyme or reason to the ordering process, and it ends up making me nervous that I'm going to be waiting and waiting only to find out that no one ever made my sandwich.  There is no official line, so you just order from whoever happens to look at you.  It's impossible to tell if you are cutting in front of someone else who has been waiting.  Then it's unclear whether to pay right after you order (if you can even make it to the register) or when you get your food.  I don't understand why they don't just set up an official ordering and paying line rather than having all the customers clustered in a group in front of the counter hoping one of the hipster clerks happens to glance their way.  Oh, and plan on waiting a long time for your food.  Apparently steaming a bagel is a long and painstaking process.

After all the hype and anticipation, I felt quite let down. I ordered an everything bagel with the homemade lox spread. I'm a huge fan of lox spread and it is my usual when I visit a bagel establishment.  Well to begin with, the bagel (being steamed) had the consistency of a No.2 pencil eraser. Way too chewy and tasteless. I like the various tastes of an everything bagel and this bagel had no taste, Bland, bland, bland. Next the lox spread. Quite a skimpy portion for the price of $3.50. Had had way better at Einstein Bros. or even DD. Seconly, the lox spread also had to flavor whatsoever. Could have fooled me that I was eating lox spread. And finally the size of the bagel. Tiny! .....So to say the least, I was not a happy camper on my virgin visit to CBA and I know it will be my last.

Apparently writing fake reviews isn't enough to bolster their reputation. They now have to resort to bribing customers with rice krispie treats.  Enough is enough. There are other alternative options (at a much better price!) with decent customer service nearby. I wouldn't dare link to those businesses, because the owner would just flag the review again.

(Jan 22) ------------------------- I'm sorry for your bad experience at my business.  Groupon has virtually bankrupted us.  After the hoards of redemptions last weekend we really had no choice but to turn away Groupon users this weekend and ask them to come back on a weekday when it was slow.  Your Groupons can be refunded by Groupon after the 18th.  Once again, we apologize. Just so you know, Groupon has bankrupted a number of small businesses. ------------------------- Response from DeaconMSA W. (Jan 29) -------------------------- Greg, I got up this Saturday to decide where to eat breakfast, and this made me think of you. Your note did not apologize for your managers poor behavior.  Further, you made a bad business deal.  That's life.  There are consequences. Instead, you basically said ""screw my customers"" and they'll have a short memory and come back soon. No, Greg, I wont.  I run a business also and I live with the contracts I sign. I'll be going to Einstein's and sharing my opinion with anyone who will listen. Pretty unprofessional.  Also, hiding behind ""Groupon has bankrupted a small amount of businesses"" is untrue.  Poor decision making has bankrupted a small amount of businesses.

Clearly, this was a last minute attempt to not voucher the hundreds of Groupons from people who, like me, had waited to use them until right before they expired because they forgot about them. Additionally, it was obviously an unplanned decision on their part to not accept them on weekends or holidays or else it would have been clarified in the fine print when I purchased it a year ago. Additionally, it looks as if they will be closing their doors until after the Groupons expire on Tuesday, as their website (see photos) was updated a few hours ago to state they are having a ""Grand Re-opening to celebrate surviving the year of the Groupon"" on Tuesday. I do understand that this small local establishment may have been overwhelmed with the influx of customers coming in right before the expiration date, but they should have extended the deadline or provided refunds rather than saying customers are just ""out of luck"" as the manager stated.

Located at 953 West Armitage, the CBA is opening a second location in the Lakeview neighborhood near the Belmont El stop. The limitless list of bagel sandwiches come steamed, making the bagel (or bialy, depending on the sandwich) warm and soft, and the cheese and toppings nice and melty. These sandwiches are messy in a good way. My favorites are the Donkey Punch - bbq chicken salad, and the Dirty Swede - turkey, bacon, cream cheese, etc. Both are exceedingly delicious, and, did I mention, messy. I'm not alone in my love for CBA. TimeOut Chicago named CBA as one of Chicago's Six Serious Sandwich Shops. Just check out the menu and you'll see what the fuss is about. It's a great place to take friends and out-of-town visitors. The place is decorated in a way that would be hard to duplicate - strange signs, photos and snarky menu additions - giving this place a unique vibe that reminds me why I wanted to move to the city. This place has 4 stars and 215 reviews on Yelp!, which means that I'm not the only person raving about it. Check out their Facebook page for updates about the new location.

I took the cashiers suggestion and got the Mikey's Munch; Roast beef, Pepper jack , lettuce, tomato, avocado, peppercorn dressing, on an everything bagel. It came out smaller  than I expected, the bagels themselves are small which in turn when chocked full of lots of yummy ingredients make them very thick sandwiches, combine that with gooey cheese and dressing and they are a little tough to eat ! But worth the trouble ! I also really like the Green-ness of CBA, often times when you get lunch from Panera or Corner Bakery you end up throwing away a bag, the bag inside the bag, and then 2 plastic containers inside of that, along with some silverware. At CBA your bagel comes out rapped in one piece of tin foil. nice and simple. Don't get offend by the large stack of napkins they offer you with your bagel, you will need them, trust me !

When I got there, I was pleasantly surprised by the calm atmosphere.  The interior was dark, woody and cozy.  Cool music was playing from the speakers above.  There was one ""sandwich artist"" and a cashier.  I followed their rules by ordering by sandwich name and not requesting any substitutions.  The cashier was nice, ringing me up with a smile and even asking if I gave my order to the guy (which I had done).  It was not busy.  One couple and one individual were in line ahead of me. So one by one everyone in front of me got their sandwiches.  The ""sandwich artist"" simply called out the items ordered and placed them on the counter facing the customer.  So I sat and I sat and I sat some more.  Other people started coming and the ""artist"" started processing their orders. Finally he noticed that I was sitting at one of the front tables, asked if I had given him my order (Uh yeah.  Who else could I have ordered from, dude?  You were the only order taker there!  Unless you have an invisible third co-worker behind the counter.), asked what I ordered and then apologized saying he had a long day.   I should have just asked for a refund because the food was definitely NOT worth the wait.  First of all, my sandwich was made with an egg bagel which I don't really care for.  Also, I was not too crazy about hardboiled egg.  I do eat boiled eggs, but is it too much to ask for scrambled or fried?  My gut told me that it was weird for them to steam every single sandwich.  (Edit 10/25/10: Another Yelper informed me: ""Items that come steamed at CBA: Meats and cheeses,  bagels and onions, green peppers mushrooms jalapeño banana peppers. Everything else gets put on after...""  I guess I was thinking more with my angry brain rather than my usual, rational self.  Either way, I still didn't care for the food and will not be back.)  I mean certain ingredients and condiments are not fit for steaming.  Who steams bacon?  GROSS!!!  Oh yeah, steamed cream cheese and mustard on some of the other items?  My stomach is just churning at the thought. Furthermore, don't give people a next time coupon for buy one, get one free on a limited selection of sandwiches.  You do something about it right then and now.  How about a free beverage or discount right on the spot? I don't plan on going back.  You treated me like crap.  Maybe I didn't fit the neighborhood demographics.  I don't know, but I'm done with you, cba.  Then again if I do return to use the coupon, I am standing RIGHT by the counter and I might even tell the guy to NOT FORGET about me again.  At least that way I can ensure he doesn't spit in my order.",0.8474,0.85,0.091,0.059,0.47684082892416213

But it's a fantastic little place for a quick bite to eat.  First off, they make bagel sandwiches. Breakfast bagel sandwiches, lunch bagel sandwiches, and eat-a-bagel sandwich at any time of day. Essentially a true bagel sandwich consists of a ""steamed"" bagel, and piled on the inside with whatever meats, condiments, cheeses, vegetables, and whatever sounds intriguing in between. The steamed process nets you a soft and chewiness on the inside of the bagel with a slight crust on the outside. And best of all if you're a meat lover or a vegetarian, grown up to little tike, they've got the sandwich for you. Another warning to any veggie lovers out there, they use all of the same steamers so every bagel sandwich no matter what you get will be sharing some close encounters with other bagel sandwiches they are steaming (I'd find this to be a good thing cause you can get a veggie but still have a little meat fat that gives it some flavor, but I guess if you're hardcore vegetarian you might not like that). Also, the service from these guys are straight up no frills straight laced kind of guys. They don't judge, laid back, cry when the Cubs lose, cheer when the Bears win, and support anything from the great state of Ohio. Plus they're making bagel sandwiches, not much service needed for that. As for the decor and ambiance, it's also no frills. A little quirky, but sometimes you get sick of all the uptightness at other joints around the city. If you can be there in the late spring/early summer or early fall, they open up the windows and it's a nice place to relax. Only recommendations is to stay away from the lunch crowd because a line forms and it's impossible to find a seat. Enjoy the wonders of a steamed bagel.",0.9834,0.788,0.147,0.065,0.5129960317460318

A traditional bialy has a diameter of up to 15 cm (6 inches) and is a chewy yeast roll similar to a bagel. Unlike a bagel, which is boiled before baking, a bialy is simply baked, and instead of a hole in the middle it has a depression. Before baking, this depression is filled with diced onions and other ingredients, including (depending on the recipe) garlic, poppy seeds, or bread crumbs. (thanks Wikipedia!).   Also...the boys that work at CBA....UBER CUTE and with beards.  I try to stick to my once-a-week-eating-out routine, but CBA you make if very difficult.",0.8329,0.828,0.097,0.076,0.5586405529953917

Thanks to Groupon, however, I was able to get $40 worth of your food for only $15 (yes, I did indeed buy the maximum 5 Groupons that day).  My three experiences thus far: 1-Rainy, cold night. I'm starting to get sick, which later turns out to be the worst cold/flu I've ever had, so I realize that I need some soup. I hear CBA serves up some chicken dumpling soup so I figure it's worth a shot. I don't actually like chicken noodle soup but it has those healing properties so I give it a try. So glad I did because I loved the creamy texture and soft, chewy dumplings. Added a garlic bagel with butter to the soup and went home to feel better. Still felt like I was dying 3 days later, but at least I wasn't hungry that night. 2-Absolutely not in the mood to cook, which is weird, so I grab a Groupon out of my desk before leaving work. God, I love that this place is so convenient for me. Anyways, takes me FOREVER to decide what sandwich I want because I originally went there for a Reuben (a recommendation from Annie T.) but got distracted by the huge menu. Still ended up with the Reuben and some yummy kettle chips. The meat was good, though it was no Max & Benny's. I just love the way they steam those bagels and serve the sandwiches hot hot hot. 3-Nothing in the fridge, grab another Groupon. This time I get one of the sandwiches not on the regular menu. They have a few that they have obviously made up more recently so they have their own little sign hanging below the menu. The Bricks and Ivy had roast beef, turkey, avocado, sprouts, a peppercorn sauce, and some other yummy stuff. Got it on a salt bagel - probably won't do that next time. I obviously knew it would be salty, but this was WAY too much sodium for me (yes, me!). I'll go back to garlic next time. They serve breakfast all day, I think, and I'm pumped to go back and get an egg and sausage sammie.

That's beside the point.  I knew I didn't care for horseradish (unless it's in mayo form from Three Floyd's Pub),  and I should have stuck with something safe like meatballs.  What pissed me off was when I went to pay.  I decided to add some chips, and the dumb broad at the register says ""one dollar""....so I assume that's my total after the groupon.  I apologize and hand her my debit card (I don't like carrying cash because I lose it, and, I just don't like carrying it) and she tells me that's ok.  Smarty-sandwich maker comes over and is all ""OH AWESOME A QUARTER!!""..........wtf?  If she had been a little clearer with her words, such as opening her mouth, I might have realized my total was actually a quarter and all chips are a dollar.  I would have ran outside and gotten one of my precious quarters.  Still...I feel bad even though they make me feel like shmucky mcgee and was about to send my mom in with a tip....I notice their nice little tip jar that not only encourages tipping on the credit card but tipping at least $2.  First of all, tip jars that say ""tips"" or mention tips are tacky.  Second of all, mentioning that nice people ""insuring their bagel is blablabla"" tip $2 pisses me off.  When you do a good job and are FRIENDLY then you deserve that extra money (in cash form, not added to the credit card)....otherwise, you don't.   My mom almost didn't go in because I told her they were impersonal or rude, her choice.  She actually almost tipped them $2 as well, but at the last moment decided not to because I was pissed off enough not to.  Small fact about me....I typically tip at places like that.  I worked at a job where tips were an added bonus and definitely appreciated, so I get it.  Besides, the food was just eh.  The bagel seemed promising, but that was overshadowed by horseradish.  I'll give them another shot, and maybe the sucky broad working there won't be there and someone pleasant will be and I'll have a delicious bagel sandwich...............but I'm leaning towards being disappointed, again.",0.9694,0.712,0.154,0.135,0.5266975308641976

When I was a kid, I pretty much lived on the bagel sandwich. So a place where that's all they serve seems perfect for me, right? Try as I might, I can't truly love CBA. I like them, sure, and I've had many a meal there during a trip to Argo or Vosges for beverages. But I'm always just barely satisfied. Part of is, I think, is the lack of customization. What I want, really, is something with the veggies of the Urban Gardener (which has all of them) and the cheeses and sauce of the Cheesemonger. I want all of this on a garlic bagel, and I want it for a great price. Somehow that just doesn't happen at CBA. You see, it's a bagel sandwich. I can make that at home for a $1. I get that you need to pay bills and employees, CBA, but $7 for a bagel with cheese and lettuce just seems like too much. When I go, my roommate always gets a plain egg with cream cheese. That costs her $3.06. I could buy a bag of bagels for that and eat bagels every day for a week. I could buy 3 days worth of quality bagels somewhere other than CBA, for sure, for that price. It's just way more than it ought to be. Also, I can get a sandwich for $7 at most places in the city. But at those places, I'd have a server. This is an order at the counter place.

I live two blocks from this disaster and cringe every time I have to walk past it.  I have four times made the mistake of eating here, and never will again. There is a big chalkboard menu on the wall, but you can hardly read it because, apparently, chalk has gotten super expensive during the recession and they can't afford to go back over all the chalk lettering that has been brushed away over the years.  Recently the management at the Chicago Bagel Authority has made the ever-effective business decision to rub out all the chalk prices by hand (and not replace them).  An eraser would have been too much planning, plus the finger marks all over the restaurant's menu tell the customer ""Heyyy, dude, it's cool, I mean if we're this laid back on the big chalk menu, don't worry at all about how insect-free we keep the bags of flour in the back."" There is one thing they have maintained quite well, however -- the 8"" lettering at the top of the menu that says:  ""$0.25 Extra For Every Substitution or Special Cooking Instruction.  Customers are advised to order directly off the menu to avoid possible dissatisfaction.""   Great, thanks.  I can't tell you how welcome I feel.  ""You want yellow mustard instead of Dijon?  That will be an extra charge.  Are you okay with that?"" Then you order.  That is, if any of the 28-year-old college-educated professional bagel makers decide it's convenient for them to pause the conversation about their personal lives to attend to the growing line of frustration personified. Again, I have been here four times.  I have never received my bagel sandwich in fewer than 15 minutes.  One time I even left to pick up my dry cleaning while my breakfast sandwich was being made.  I was the only customer in the restaurant.  I got my dry cleaning and then bought milk at the 7-Eleven on the other end of the block.  When I returned I was told to wait another 10 minutes because my sandwich wasn't ready (and the conversation about what Sally told Jennifer she heard about David's sister wasn't over).  I was the only customer in a bagel shop and my single bacon-egg-and-cheese bagel took just under 20 minutes!   My sandwich came in a piece of aluminum foil with a pretentious attitude from the professional bagel maker.  It cost about $6 and was small enough to fit inside a standard coffee cup.  These are not traditional boiled bagels.  They are half the normal size and STEAMED.  It's a soggy, sub-par mess of an insult sandwich. The Chicago Bagel Authority is a sad example of how a good restaurant can turn bitter, unwelcoming and bad when laziness and mediocre leadership are unhappily married to cheaper ingredients and smaller portions.

From the first bite I was getting potbelly deliciousness flashbacks.  While I can't remember the name of this glorious creation (it's not on the menu I took home) I can say this: super-thin shaved roast beef, the thinnest, crispiest bacon I've ever had (how DO they do that without burning it???), smoked cheddar, lettuce, tomato and peppercorn dressing on a bialy.  When I saw that they steam their sandwiches I was worried, envisioning a soggy mess.  NOT.  They assemble the sandwich, tightly wrap it in foil, then stick it in the steamer so that the sandwich heats up, melding all the flavors, and crisping up the bread just so.  SO DELICIOUS! CBA is FULL of DePaul kids and LP moms at lunchtime.  Despite the seeming chaos of the order-taking system I quickly realized that it's done a lot like at a bar: whoever is ready and makes eye-contact with a sandwich-maker first gets served...then you get ""in line"" to pay.  Super friendly service, despite the mayhem, is noted and greatly appreciated. Other than the sandwiches...the NUMEROUS selections of sandwiches...they only serve chips, whole fruit, bottled beverages and wrapped treats (the smores crispy treat was interesting).  If they went one step further and served nice little sides like pasta and fruit salads, maybe a potato product, I'd give this place 5 stars in a heartbeat.

I'm a toasted bagel girl.  Steamed is great & all, but I prefer a little grit, not just soft mush.  Also, I'm used to NY bagels, so it's just not the same.  That being said, I have to reluctantly admit that when you're feeling it, CBA hits the spot.  & yes, the place is crawling with hungover De Paul students postponing the walk of shame & stroller moms (not that there's anything wrong with either).  The seating does suck & the whole process seems haphazard (especially since the employees act like you're a total dumba** if you don't know how to order & wait for your sammich - it's a freakin' sandwich, chill).  But ... there are plenty of vegetarian options & like someone else mentioned, it's a good take-away food for a little picnic at Oz Park.",0.5994,0.761,0.136,0.103,0.6068181818181819

2006-04-09,4.0,Quite a delicious alternative to Potbelly's.  I love how the use real bagels and there's so many sandwiches to choose from -- highly recommend the Depaul Reuben if you like corned beef! :)  Steaming a sandwich takes like a whole century but it's definitely well worth the wait.  They also have these really yummy chocolate chip cookies and rice krispie treats.,0.9731,0.641,0.359,0.0,0.514

At first I was obsessed with the steam bagel concept...it brought me back to my college days. However, the last 2 experiences i've had at CBA haven't been great.  I haven't felt well after eating there, which could definitely be due to the hangovers the night before.  It kind of turned me off to the CBA, but I guess I should give it another chance soon.",0.1521,0.874,0.067,0.06,0.48928571428571427

The coffee is pretty good too.  I like how the place is decorated, even if it's all Ohio State stuff.  If they ever go under, I hope I can snag the Stroh's sign.  Which leads me to question, why is a Detroit beer given such prominence in an Ohio State bar?  Could it be because the Buckeyes suck ass?",0.8728,0.768,0.156,0.075,0.5542857142857144
