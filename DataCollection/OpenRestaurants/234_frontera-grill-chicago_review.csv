2017-09-03,3.0,"I stopped by for lunch in the middle of the week and they had a line of people already formed outside waiting for them to open. We were able to snag one of the last tables out on their sidewalk. We decided on the queso fundido, grill-roasted elote corn, the feature fish with tomato-morita and watercress and the grill-roasted shrimp tostada. The queso fundido was a decent sized portion and was served with warm tortillas. There were plenty of onions, peppers and chorizo. And make sure to use their salsas! Don't be afraid to ask for extra tortillas when you run out! I wish the serving dish was able to retain it's heat better so the cheese wouldn't harden up so quickly. The elote was okay. The corn was huge and super messy. The topping were good, but the roasted corn was a little over cooked and could have tasted fresher. The rockfish was really good. The meat was moist and tender, the mashed potato with chives and crema was the best I've had, the watercress was refreshing and the sauce was smoky and a bit spicy. The roasted shrimp tostadas were ok. I missed the part where it said the toppings were cold, so that was a bit of a surprise. The flavor was good and it reminded me of ceviche. The salad that came with it was unfortunately over-dressed and pretty spicy.  Overall, lunch was decent. My rockfish dish was exceptional, but everything else was just okay. Luckily, the menu is quite large so there are plenty of other dishes to try. I'd definitely skip the elote next time.",0.9895,0.807,0.163,0.03,0.5525683421516754

2017-08-22,4.0,"Having been to Xoco last time we were in Chicago, this time we opted for Rick Bayless' James Beard awarded restaurant Frontera Grill. As I was in a soup mood, we shared their famous tortilla soup ($9) and the carnes al carbon para tacos ($20). The soup was a dark broth with pasilla, grilled chicken, avocado, artisan Jack cheese, homemade crema, and crispy tortilla strips. It was hearty and delicious - the perfect soup for whether you're cold or just need a warm hug inside. We opted for the skirt steak tacos, but our server made a mistake and brought us portobello mushrooms at first. He was nice enough to comp us for the mushrooms, and we ended up having both the steak and mushroom tacos for the price of one. The steak was marinated with garlic and a variety of spices, while the mushrooms were marinated with garlic, agave nectar, and spices. Both were delicious and packed with flavor. I wasn't even that hungry, but the tacos made me eager for more.  For less than $40, we had a very satisfying meal at Frontera Grill. We would absolutely come back here (or any of Rick Bayless' restaurants to be frank). There are a lot more options on the menu that we haven't tried, and we'll just have to come back to Chicago soon to get our Bayless Mexican fill.",0.9722,0.87,0.117,0.013,0.5908333333333333

My biggest issue is the two times we've been we've had underwhelming service.

2017-08-13,3.0,"Frontera Grill was pretty disappointing, For all the great reviews and the raved about Rick Bayless high-end Mexican restaurant, the food was a little disappointing. The food is ok to great but lacked consistency. The service was mediocre. We arrived an hour early, had a snack next door and arrived on time.  We were seated in a spacious booth seat.  We ordered the ceviche trio ($ 24), carne asada brava ($ 29) and enchiladas de cochinita pibil ($19). The ceviche trio was the best part of the meal. The tropical ceviche was mango tuna with red onions. This was refreshingly sweet and delicious. I also liked the Frontera ceviche with Hawaiian albacore, lime and tomatoes.  The enchiladas were ok. Unfortunately the ""slow-cooked suckling pig cochinita pibil"" was dry and lacked many of the flavors of cochinita pibil such as cinnamon, cumin and orange flavors. It just tasted like a slightly dry roasted pork.  The carne asada brava was flank steak, which was a perfect medium rare with grilled knob onions. The green onion part was wrapped into a knot. The flavors were ok but a little bland. This is something that could be made at home. The best part of this dish was the sweet corn tamales. They tasted of sweet fluffy corn cakes.  Unfortunately, the service was not great. One of servers tossed my plate in front of me like a frisbee instead of handing it to me or placing it down in front of me. Some of the servers were great- explaining a dish while placing it on the table. Our waiter was very nice.  All in all, there are much better Mexican restaurants that you can spend your money on.

2017-08-06,1.0,"Wow, what a disappointment.  I'm a fan of Tortas Fronteras in O'Hare and was excited to try many of the upscale Mexican fusion dishes here.  Food ranged from average to just plain mediocre, but at very high prices. And the service was awful. It was the first time as an adult that I did not leave a tip for poor service (well, actually, I left a penny to send a message).  We had an amazing experience at another upscale Mexican place the night before. This pales in comparison. The chips were too salty and tasted like they came straight from a bag. Salsa and guac portions were stingy. My enchilada was average but it still set me down $19.  My friend ordered what he thought was a vegetable heavy dish only to receive something that was more like a mozzarella stick. He returned it and exchanged it for something else, but the waiter was not apologetic.  He ordered several side dishes instead. One of them was pretty much raw cauliflower in a cream sauce. Are you kidding me? You're charging premium prices for cauliflower and you're not even cooking it?? When we pointed out that the dish was not to our liking, our waiter did not flinch. I told him we'd like to have it deducted from our bill and he didn't even acknowledge my request--that's how I decided he didn't deserve a tip. The guy simply didn't care!  Frontera is such a joke. I honestly should have asked to speak to the manager, but I hope management sees this review and the note I left on the receipt (""mediocre food, LOUSY service, not coming back!"").",0.9543,0.766,0.15,0.084,0.5015639499389499

Wait Time:  The best part of our experience here - the opportunity for a (party of 2) to sit at the chef's counter.  At 8:45 PM on a Wednesday evening, the wait time for a table was 2+ hours...but we were able to sit immediately at the counter!  I was starving and grateful for this option.  Plus, it's always fun to be in the thick of a busy kitchen watching chefs at work. Drinks:  I had the Oaxaca Tropical ($13) which was rimmed with an excessive amount of salt to the point that at first, I could only describe my cocktail as ""salty"" - it was overwhelming and totally took over the flavors of the drink.  When my tastebuds did recover, it was a great drink, with lovely presentation.  Later, I had the Moody Tongue (local brewery) sliced nectarine IPA. Food: This is where things really get hazy.  We shared the Chef's Choice guacamole - I pulled up the restaurant menu in the hopes to remember what the ingredients were, but a different guac is listed on the site right now.  It was pretty boring, and tasted like...normal guacamole.  I had expected to be wowed with flavor that could stand up to the ""Chef's Choice"" description, but those flavors fell flat.   As for my entree, I had a grilled shrimp dish - but I can't remember how it was prepared or what the flavors were.  It too was unmemorable and just ""fine"".  Nothing to write home about.

Reservations are hard to come by (I think mainly because they save only a limited number of spots for reservations), but if you decide to make one (which I recommend unless you want to wait an hour) be prepared to still wait a few mins for your table, which is what we did. The space actually isn't huge so it was understandable I suppose. The ambience is pretty loud and bustling. I could hear the people next to me but not one more person over (was in a group of 7). The service was good. For drinks I ordered the house margarita which was delicious (albeit kinda small). It packed a punch though and I would get it again. For food I got the cheesy quesadilla/empanadas which was good! (But I mean it's cheese...so of course). And for my entree I ordered the halibut. The dish was cooked perfectly and the portion was generous. I like that corn tortillas are served for the table to share as well. The green rice that came with it was delicious and the green sauce was good, and definitely had a kick to it. The complimentary guacamole w/ chips and salsa was great (prolly my favorite part of the meal honestly). All in all everything was good.

These were like little dough puffs with some mexican fillings and salsas. There wasn't a lot of texture throughout the piece, just more of an overall chewy feel.  Tacos Arabes (4/5) --- N/A Halibut, Green Garlic Salsa Verde (4/5) --- The fish was good. The green rice was good. I also ordered a side of mashed potatoes because mashed potatoes can make or break a meal for me; those were also good. My order was pretty awesome, when it comes to the taste. Although half the plate was vegetables, I don't think there was an unfair portion control. It all went together pretty well.  Summary: Overall, this dinner was special, unfortunately not because of the dinner itself though. Our waiter was good, our food was good, the overall service and experience was good. I am a strong believer in quantity over quality so I was just taken back by how much everything was when it felt like there wasn't that much food. For a glass of margarita and chardonnay, ceviche, empanadas, steak tacos, halibut with potatoes, I paid $110+. I guess it was nice to have ""Rick Baylee's"" food, but for a shaky table, delayed appetizer, and a little over priced entrees, the hype was too much.",0.9956,0.746,0.19,0.064,0.4861530830280832

2017-06-06,5.0,"I had been wanting to visit Chicago just to eat at this place. I was VERY afraid that my high expectations would disappoint me! I was by no means disappointed!!! Authentic Mexican flavors which you rarely get in the US. We got there around 1:30pm on a weekday and while it was busy it wasn't overly packed. We got seated right away. There were 6 of us. We ordered margaritas to start. All I can say is WOW! Those were the best margaritas I've had in a while! We got a queso fundido for starters. Rather than chips which is an old and tired way of serving them, this queso came with nice tortillas. The queso had some chorizo in it which made it that much better. One thing I will say is that I thought the portion was slightly too small. Not really enough for six if you wanted more than one big queso bite. I asked the server if I should get the tamales (the day's special) or the chicken enchiladas with mole. She strongly recommended the enchiladas and she was oh so right!!! I've been a fan of mole, all kinds of mole, for as long as I can remember. To me, if done right, it's a practically perfect food. This one was practically perfect in every way. It was sweet with a hint of spiciness but was not overpowering.  I also had my daughter's meat since she wasn't eating much. I could tell the meat was not only cooked to perfection but it was also a great cut of meat, high quality. Not cheap, hard meat.  I don't have much of a review for the other dishes on the table but at least what I had was nearly perfect. I wish I could go back over and over again.",0.9838,0.831,0.131,0.038,0.5698778998778997

The tamales were dry and had the consistency of grainy cornbread, the tacos were okay but had absolutely no flavor to the meat and veggies. As we were finishing the whole staff was basically congregated and hanging out behind the bar while managers sat at the bar eating and all of the employees soon followed and sat down to start eating at tables around other eating customers while they were still in the establishment.

2017-05-10,4.0,"I was traveling alone and figured I would try and snag a place at the bar of a nice restaurant for a Saturday night dinner! I love Mexican and had a great torta from Frontera in the airport, so I was very excited to try the restaurant! I arrived at 5:05 PM and the bar area was already packed! The hostess assured me that things would clear out around 5:15 when they started seating in the restaurant. That was indeed true, but I had to be vigilant to snag a seat as people cleared out, as many had the same plan as me. I sat at the bar and received absolutely wonderful service from the woman at the bar. This was better service than you would typically get at a restaurant, which was impressive. I started with the fresh tuna tostada. The amount of fresh tuna was impressive, although it did make the tostada a bit difficult to eat. I hoped for the dish to have some spice, but it was a bit bland. Perhaps I should have gone with the ceviche. For the main course, I enjoyed the skirt steak tacos. The steak was cooked perfectly. The salsas were good but, again, not very spicy. My favorite part was probably the beans - I don't typically like beans very much, but these had a smoky delicious flavor.

We were forced to wait over an hour despite numerous open tables. It seemed highly unorganized.  The music was loud, making it necessary  to shout to have a conversation. With all the tables doing this, it was annoying. Just turning down the music a bit could make it a better place to eat. And the tables are so jammed together you get bumped by the wait staff as the go by, but you may appreciate the body heat because the temperature control was horrible. It kept going from warm to very cold, so bring a jacket.  The food was way over-priced. $20 for tacos is outrageous, even for downtown Chicago. And you will pay more if you want a small basket of chips, which is free at most other Mexican restaurants. The food was mediocre. The beef came out cold and unevenly cooked. Some slices were well done and some were barely seared. The guacamole had no flavor; it was smashed avocado with a few bits of tomato. Highly disappointing. The one good aspect was the tortillas. Hot and delicious.  A colleague recommends the ceviche trio. The choco layer desert was yummy, BUT you better crush on nutmeg or skip the ice cream. Overall, I expected better and was disappointed.

2017-03-16,5.0,"Honest review: idk why there are so many bad reviews of this restaurant.The food is amaizing and authentic.I understand that its pricy,not the biggiest portions,and the service sucked, having a bad experience doesn't mean this place sucks.You also cant just order two menu items and say the food sucks when u just tried two things Service:i hated the service called for reservations they said its to packed came n there were alot of tables open.When i got there they said 1 hour wait n when this person left a new person came n was like oh i can sit u now?Idk why restaurants do this if i wasnt hungry i would have left so rude to lie to customers to make it seem like ur busy is pathetic.Then are server was a dick.we would try to ask for things n he would jus run by us?If i was the manager would fire the employee.Get:pozole,ceviche ,tamal, steak,toffee pudding, tres leche Butternut squash Bocoles 10$:supper tasty! The chicken was supper tender and flavorful, the salsa was nice and spicy and smokey. I liked the cheese cut down the spicyness. Didnt taste the butternut squash the sweetness would have been good. It is kinda like a gordita.  One thing it needed was some crunch, and a wow factor. It was good but not as amaizn as everything else.  Ceviche trio ofof24$: must order!!! Shrimp scapllop ceviche verde (green one in the middle) amaizin!! The seafood was really tender it was a lil spicy and the sauce wasnt to acidic this was my favorite one the cucumber and the jimica added freshness to cut through the richness. Like nothing overpowered the seafood. Tropical tuna: this was my second favorite. Its like a guac with tuna and papaya amaizin. The guac is spicy and acidic n the fruit is really sweet complimented the tuna perfectly. My only complaint is the tuna was to soft add something crunchy or pick seafood with texture. Classic: this is like a fancy version of what people are use to. Its really acidic n the fish wasnt over powered really tasty. I would recommend getting the unique ceviches. I would love if u could pick which ceviches u want in the trio that would be awesome! Tamal colado $9: best tomal i ever had. The tamal was supper tender i hate when their dry. The tamal was sweet so it paired perfectly with the savory dish. The turkey was supper tender and flavorful. The broth was supper rich so decadent so much depth of flavor. Just pls add more broth. The onions on top were so spicy i loved it!! I would order this again Shrimp pozole $28 sorry abuelita rick bayless pozole is better then urs! The broth is so rich and full of depth! The only issue put more broth plz!! N it was spicy yes! Couldnt stop eating. The reason why its so expensive is because there is so much shrimp. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and was so flavorful. I liked that they used cabbage instead of lettuce way more flavorful. I loved the radish adds a nice fresh note. The harmony was a little to hard for my taste wish they could do something more inventive like fry it that would be cool. Wish instead of grilled tortillas they would have gave us chicharon had it once like that cont go back! Then give me a lemon not a lime plz i would order this in a heart beat Oaxacan carne asada $34: expensive but best steak youll ever have. Served with tortillas eat it as a taco with everything! The ribeye was grilled beutifully and seasoned so good so flavorful. Cooked perfectly. The reason why this is one of the best steaks is instead of just putting salt n pepper it has other delicious components that work well together. The sauce is supper rich and spicy like i wish i could drink it. The plantains added a nice sweet note to cut through the richness. The guac was creamy and acidic and the raw onions cut through the richness. Then black beans yes black beans taste the best makes the taco the best my only complaint wish there was something crunchy and add more tortillas plz! Sticky toffee tamarind pudding $9: (its like a moist cake): the cake was really moist, the tamarind sauce was really acidic which cuts through the richness of the dish. The menu said it was infused with chili put more plz because it would cut through the sourness and sweetness and make it a better dish.goat cheese ice cream was amaizin perfect texture but more goat cheese plz couldnt tell it was goatcheese.the bacon was amaizin love sweet and savory omg more desserts need bacon just needs a less smokier bacon would order this again  Dos tres cuatro cake $9 omg it was amaizin and i hate mexican hot chocolate. The cake was supper moist n not to sweet. Its chocolate on chocolate the top is like chocolate brittle then theres candied nuts the texture of this dish was amaizin! Loved the merangue so tasty!! Then theres chocolate icecream!!! Omg if u love chocolate order this must order only complaints just wish there was something acidic, savory, or spicy but i loved it. Chocolate pecan pie 8.50$: amaizin but not as good as other",0.9998,0.668,0.279,0.054,0.57941012080163
2017-03-12,5.0,"I have eaten dinner at Frontera Grill twice now and it is one of my favorite restaurants. Rick Bayless designed a menu of familiar Mexican dishes with simplicity and panaché that I truly enjoyed. The first time I visited, I had a reservation for myself, which had been secured more than a month in advance. The second time, I ate at the bar alongside the kitchen without a reservation. Both times I began with ceviches from the raw seafood bar along with a draft Negro Modelo, that wonderful example of Vienna lager.  For entrées, I have tried the carne asada brava, basically flank steak with tamales and corn, and the next time I ate the carnes al cabron with duck breast medium rare, which are duck corn tacos covered in habañero salsa. The duck tacos were truly memorable and I still think about trying to replicate them in my own kitchen. After eating, be sure to enjoy a sipping añejo tequila as an digestif.

Once we got past that, the food was pretty good.  The Rosa Mexicana cocktail was delicious (not too sweet), the ceviche was my favorite of the night, the Chicken Pipan was well-cooked and flavorful, but there was a little too much heat for me to fully enjoy it (I am a bit of a wimp when it comes to heat, though), and the sopa di frutas was good, but nothing outstanding (and kind of on the small side).  The service seemed on the slow side, as it took us a full two hours for the meal.

It was a grilled whitefish and the sauce was also just fine. The fish was a little too overcooked, IMO. It wasn't hard and dry by any means, but fresh fish should be grilled until *just* cooked when the flakes are still soft and juicy.

I secured reservations for this place about 5 weeks in advance.  The earliest seating I could get a for a Friday night was at 9:30pm, which was a little disappointing.  Me and my wife were in the area and decided to stop in at 7:30pm and see if we could get put on a wait list or something like that, and they ended up seating us immediately!   Hurray!

SOOOO DISAPPOINTING :(    That's ok though, the menu is robust enough with tons of other great options.   We ordered: CLASSIC FRONTERA CEVICHE - Delicious.... classic flavors with just enough kick to it.  SOPECITOS RANCHEROS - The star of the dinner honestly.  The sopecitos were perfectly crispy and the braised beef inside was so delicious. OAXACAN CARNE ASADA - This was a quality steak with a nice rub.  I wouldn't say that it was too unique.  The rub was quite nice. Comes with fresh made tortillas for some way too good DIY steak tacos. PORK, MANCHAMENTELES - This was also quite tasty.  Not as flavorful as the apps, but so good regardless.  DÚO DE FLANES - our dessert.  just some standard good flan. The total was not unreasonable at all.. less than $80 for the 2 of us, for this quality of a meal.  We loved it!!  Would love to come back to try more stuff, but unfortunately, we live thousand miles away.  He's opening a Red O near me in San Diego though,which I can't wait to try.",0.9981,0.669,0.262,0.069,0.6389339826839827
2016-12-10,5.0,"This was the highlight of my recent girls weekend in Chicago. Tiffany C is the only person I know who has a love affair with Mexican food like I do so coming here was a must. I secured reservations about a month in advance and still the earliest seating was 9 PM. And it was crazy busy still at that hour!   The host stand was a bit nuts and we waited about 10 minutes to be seated. Led to our table for 2 we were sat closely between another table of 2 and a rather loud obnoxious table of 4. We ended up talking briefly with both of the parties next to us, that's how close we were. It didn't bother me, I'm a friendly person but keep this in mind if you don't enjoy that. Might not be the best place for a romantic date but perhaps you can request a more private table.  On to the food, the wonderful food. I'm just going to disclose now that we ordered way too much food!  We started with the guacamole and chips and salsa. The green Verde salsa was amazing. The guac was good and the chips were fresh and tasty. Tortilla soup is one of my favorites and I have to say that Bayless does it better than anyone. The presentation is fabulous and the broth has so many layers of flavor. It's a large portion and I was sad to see it come to an end. I chose the fresh fish selection and it was a light and flaky snapper that was melt in your mouth delicious in a wonderful and unique mushroom sauce. Tiffanie ordered the special of the day (Friday) which was the brisket and was disappointed when they were out of it (darn 9 PM reservation!). She asked our waiter to choose her entrée and let him know she wanted something unique. Her entrée ended up being the duck and she loved it. We had initially talked about dessert but we were both too full to think about it.  I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to try modern Mexican food. Just make your reservations far in advance and for Pete's sake don't try to order fajitas like the loud guy at the table next to us did!",0.9951,0.774,0.176,0.05,0.5548449612403101
2016-12-09,5.0,"Were I to become any sort of professional chef the kind I'd most desire to be is one whose resume looks a lot like that of Frontera Grill owner, Rick Bayless.  His is a deep, anthropological dive into the cuisines of Mexico involving many years of culinary research.  The mere idea of learning - then being able to execute - the wide variety of regional Mexican cuisines strikes me as fascinating and worthy of attention.  As a result, dining at Bayless' original restaurant, Frontera Grill, while visiting Chicago was a no-brainer.   Frontera Grill is one of 3 Bayless owned restaurants sitting in a row on N. Clark Street.  He's got all ground covered with an inexpensive torta shop (XOCO) and a high-end, Michelin star venue (Topolobampo).  Frontera Grill fits the mid-slot quite nicely, specializing in Contemporary regional cuisine with special emphasis on the region of Oaxaca.   Lunching at Frontera was fun.  For starters, they seated us in the bar area, a section which appeared reserved for women who do lunch.  Small 2-3 person tables dominated this area - filled with females - with a gleaming full bar sitting across a narrow walkway.  I honestly never missed seeing the main dining room.   With small tabletops it's easy to fill them and there's no pleasure so fine as a table overflowing with a wide variety of excellent Mexican fare.  My dining companion was thinking of ordering an entree until I persuaded her of the benefits of ordering exclusively from the ""Appetizers"", ""Starters"", and ""Sides"" section of the menu.  If you're adventurous and want to try a whole lot of different flavors this is how I'd recommend approaching the menu.    Begin with one of 6 Margaritas ranging in price from $11-$30 then sit back and watch your table fill up.  Ours was a Bacchanalian orgy of riches:  Classic Queso Fundido ($8, fabulous), Taquitos Banados ($8), Frontera Guacamole ($9), Sopecita Rancheros ($8), Fresh Corn Tamales ($7), and a couple of additional small specials.  I'd be fibbing only a wee bit if I told you we ate it all.  A few bites were left on only a couple of plates; the rest were practically licked clean.   It's true that there was nothing I tasted here that I've not tasted elsewhere but the flavors here are true and pure, the result of using the best ingredients possible.  Frontera's menu reads like one from a top San Francisco restaurant:  ""organic"", ""sustainably raised"", ""local"", and ""artisanal"" are words that can be found all over it.  And they know what to do with these top ingredients.   Frontera has been around for a long time and felt not at all like it was resting on any laurels.  Without reservation I can say that, if you're anything like me, you'll leave here quite delighted by the experience.",0.995,0.841,0.149,0.01,0.5281168831168832

Once the doors opened we were allowed in after a woman took our name down along with my cell#. We were told we can sit at any black table and even eat because it's first come first serve. Well that was not our plan as we wanted to enjoy the food in the dining area and I thought since people ahead of us started ordering food and cocktails the wait would not be so bad....so we waited (we brought 2 kids with us since it was a mother daughter night kind of a thing). I don't know if it's because we didn't order anything that we were not seated for what seemed like eternity. It was a Sat evening so I knew other places would already be packed too so we waited. It was not that busy so we waited further. .....it wasn't until 15 mins to 6 that I asked the hostess for an update. I was reassured we are next in line and will be seated at 6. It was going on 6:20 and another lady came by and told us they called my phone and even texted. I triple checked my phone and no calls came thru nor texts. They could have left a vm but I never received any either. One lady who I can assume was another hostess apologized and explained some carriers somehow have issues receiving the calls or texts so I told her I have TMOBILE after she asked. We were finally seated downstairs which looked like the basement and smelled like one too. We sat down at almost 645. I was still willing to give this place a chance since the reviews were pretty good and the kids were now restless and tired. The food was just okay though the sauces were pretty good. My brother in law is Mexican and when his mom flies in from out of town she cooks for the entire family.....yes, that's when I come over to partake. The steak (Brava) was cold and I had ordered it medium but was actually on the med well side. The sweet corn mass was good .....that was actually the tastiest thing on my plate. We also ordered the shrimp dish.....not bad. We ordered a side of the onion bulbs and it was undercooked and cold so that was a disappointment.

Perhaps because of my expectations, I came away slightly disappointed with the food, at least in terms of value.  We were pleasantly surprised with what was brought before us, and loved the experience, but I found myself thinking that Xoco had better food for the dollar.  My suggestion would be to consider Xoco as a much, much cheaper alternative, or step up to Topolo which I think is really the experience we should have gone for if we had been able to land a last minute reservation (our trip here was spontaneous).   Walking in on the dawn of Trump's election, it was pleasantly comforting to find that the entire brilliant staff was of Mexican and I'm guessing other Latin backgrounds--a welcome reminder of the contributions of our hard working immigrants from the south in a restaurant industry that usually keeps them off the wait staff and hides their significant contributions in the kitchen.  We ate at the chefs table, which actually doesn't show you much of the action, but it meant we had no wait, and I enjoyed being closer to the wait staff and away from the crowds.   Four stars for the food, and five for the experience, people, and groundbreaking approach to cuisine.

The drink - After a night of partying at the lobster bash we had a craving for Bloody Mary and Bloody Maria's.  Neither of them were very good and in fact we sent them back in favor of wine for the ladies and straight tequila for the gents.  Good selection of both.

I had lunch, so it was a fairly simple meal, compared to some of their main entree fare. Even so, the tacos, quesadillas, taquitos, rice and beans were all elevated miles higher than your average Mexi food places. Everything was excellent. I'm not a fan of black beans, but I would eat these particular black beans for every meal. Every item I tried has amazing flavor and texture combinations. Some were exotic, and others were exactly what you'd expect from Mexican fare. I loved every bite of every dish. The service was great and the ambiance is very cool.

I have lived in Chicago all my life and have never been to an upscale restaurant that makes their guests wait in line like cattle!

After 3 days of shopping, moving, orientation and then saying goodbye, my thoughtful husband made reservations at Frontera Grill for a nice dinner before leaving Chicago. He made a reservation specifying that one diner is Celiac and requires Gluten Free for medical reasons. My husband researched the restaurant and although it does not have a separate GF menu, many GF bloggers wrote that GF was not a problem at Frontera and that accommodations could be made. Long story short....if you are GF, I would not spend my money at Frontera Grill. I was looking forward to a nice dinner after saying goodbye to my son. Instead I was so frustrated that I couldn't wait to leave. Many beers on the menu but not one GF. Would you like some guacamole & chips? No chips here because they can't spare a fryer that is separate for GF items! Hey Rick, could you run down to Whole Foods or the local bodega and pick up some plain corn chips for the many GF diners who come to your 4.5 star restaurant? Many of the dishes I wanted to try I was told I couldn't have. I am so disappointed in Rick Bayless' exclusion of GF people.

We waited probably 20-30 minutes for some seats to open up and eventually just one did on the end, but it was enough for us to set up house in the corner with one person standing egads!

2016-09-05,5.0,"Have been to Topolo and Xoco already on previous trips to Chicago, so finally got a chance to try the middle child of Rick Bayless family this time around. I made a reservation online a couple of months in advance (they only offer up limited seats to reserve ahead of time, otherwise all first come first serve).  The decor is awesome here, lots of traditional art as well as costumes. The dining room is essentially lined with tables on 1 side (the reservable part) and a long bar (with lots lots of tequila on the wall) on the other. Cocktail menu is tequila and mezcal focused and look fantastic. It was lunch time, so I went with a glass of sangria. Wow let me tell you... Pretty much 95% of the sangria I've had in my life thus far taste like juice, and I can down 3-4 glasses easy. Even though I had breakfast earlier that day already, this is potent stuff and I was getting buzzed on 1 glass. And that's a good thing folks. The menu is extensive, and we were slightly overwhelmed with all the choices, so went with the sampler options.  Starter: Old School Frontera Trio - 2 each of Mexico City style corn masa quesadilas (love the corn and the cheese was so creamy on the inside), chicken taquitos (cripsy and on a mound of super fresh guac), and albacore tuna ceviche (nice and zesty). This was a very good start. Entree: BIG wood-grilled tacos al carbon trio - Comes with skirt steak, duck breast and chicken breast, shishito peppers and onions, and of course home made tortillas. Grilling meat to perfection is not easy, but doing all 3 so well (especially chicken) is mad skills. And gosh by BIG they really weren't kidding, this combo easily serves 2 realy hungry to 3 slightly less hungry adults. The bottled Frontera sauce is already quite good, very savory up front but watch out for the kick afterwards! Overall, another fantastic Bayless experience. Where Topolo is modern and inventive, Xoco is fun and casual, Frontera Grill fit the middle perfectly with well executed traditional dishes that feel homey and comforting.

But upon reviewing the entree mole perpetrations they seemed uninspiring.   The four items we settled on were the Corn Tamale, the Old School Frontera trio, the mole enchiladas, and the Grilled chicken, mole almendrado. None of the dishes were inspirational. Generally the dishes with chicken were lacking in flavor. The chicken was dry and under seasoned. The mole sauces were singular. I expect a richness and layering of chiles, nuts, seeds, spices and other elements.  Not these moles. If I had experienced mole the first time at Frontera Grill, I probably would not like mole sauces. The best dish of the night was the ceviche tostadas.

2016-07-31,4.0,"Frontera Grill may be my favorite restaurant in the entire City of Chicago. They always impress me with the freshness of the ingredients, monthly tweaking of the menu, friendly usually efficient service, and really special Mexican flavors. The food energizes me with beautiful ingredients and both unique but relatable flavors and preparations. However, I would say this is a ""hit or miss"" establishment, as I'm not always completely pleased with every dish I order, so it's wise to know the consistent stand-bys if you're not in a more adventurous mood. For example, sometimes they have a chiles rellenos which is truly a stuffed chile, and not like the battered type. Eh. And once I tried one of their aguachiles, and was greeted with a very fishy odor when they brought me my plate. And sometimes the appetizers come a little cooler than I prefer. A more common complaint for me however is the truly extreme saltiness of some dishes. Randomly, like the brunch chilaquiles and sometimes their non-chicken enchiladas taste like they must have individually salted every single component of the dish, rendering a final dish where every mouthful seems like there must be a 1/4g of salt. If the kitchen fixed the inconsistent extreme saltiness of their food, then they deserve 5 stars on yelp. But as they have sent such salty food out for quite some time, it indicates the cooks need to do more tasting please. I know they want to be held to the highest standards. Brunch corn pancakes are recommended with the real maple syrup! More hearty texture then regular buttermilk pancakes. Yum. I wrote this review to share my second experience with the Frontera Grill chiles rellenos. The battered type. To even have the privilege of tasting one of their limited quantity chiles rellenos specials, you must basically be in the first seating, and order yours immediately. The velvety texture of the souffle batter with the chewy cheese filling, and rich well seasoned tomato sauce combine nicely. And the white rice and black beans are the best rice 'n beans I've ever tasted in any Mexican restaurant. Slightly al dente rice grains have a great texture to contrast the chiles rellenos, and the soft slightly mashed black beans help with the (apparently unpredictable) level of heat with the main dish as well. My server said their chiles rellenos can either turn out not very spicy or very spicy. Mine were moderate/very spicy this last time. You used to only be able to order these if you knew to ask. I guess they used to only make five orders of the chiles rellenos each day in the past, and you had to know to ask the server because it was never on the menu. And it apparently usually sold out within the first couple minutes of service. While I agree as an entire dish it is the best chiles rellenos I have ever tasted, is it worth $24 or the hassle of ensuring you are the first person in the door to get one? Eh, maybe once, but I wouldn't necessarily stress out over it. For those who like spicy, Frontera Grill offers an off-menu habanero salsa. It has the signature habanero light, fruity, innocent scent almost reminiscent of passion fruit, but definitely adds significant heat with every literal drop. The flavor is both delicate but intensely spicy. Desserts are also one of my highlights at Frontera Grill. Perhaps the best most tender flan I've ever tasted. Chocolate pecan pie with Kahlua whipped cream is always dependable. And their current tres leches cake rendition is usually excellent because they seem to always incorporate the maximum combination of amazing flavors and textures (crispy, chewy, soft, crunchy, moist, cold, salty, sweet, bitter, umami).",0.9981,0.783,0.17,0.047,0.5173781346858269

2016-07-13,3.0,"I've tried Frontera Grill for both Brunch and Dinner and had goodexperiences both times. Their service is on par and their food is very good. One negative about Frontera is their prices. They definitely price their options towards the higher end for Mexican and the only thing that will help make you feel like they are not too high is by looking at the prices of the connected restaurant Topolobampo next door. (Those are even higher) That being said, the food here is very good. For brunch I HIGHLY recommend the Chilaquiles with Guajillo. It's not that big of a portion so it's easy for one person to take down but I loved the sauce on here and it was very very tasty.  Their guacamole here is very good, but similar to my brunch option the portion was a little small.  Maybe I'm just used to the American way of giving wayyyyy to much food and stuffing my face but since that's what I'm used to that's what I expect. For the main dish I tried the Oaxacan-Style Carne Asada With keeping with the theme of everything else I've had here it tasted very good but was more on the smaller side (and expensive) Overall Frontera is a very good place and I'd recommend it for upscale Mexican.

2016-07-13,1.0,"What a disappointment. After years of hearing about this restaurant, I can honestly say that I had a better food experience at the Chicago airport outpost of Rick Bayless than I did at Fronterra Grill! First of all, do not come here if you actually want to hear what the other person at the table has to say. We took some Londoners here as a fun experience and unfortunately no one could hear anyone else at the table speak because this restaurant is so incredibly, shockingly loud. Then there are all the busboys and waiters who do not care that you are eating, they bump into your chair and stand there and touch you on the back while they are talking to the table behind you, because all tables are so close together. And yes, I live and dine out in New York City, so I am used to close tables. However, I am also used to people who respect personal space and don't touch other diners. This was just weird. Then there is the food. I can honestly say that this food is bland. Bland Bland Bland!! Even if you don't like things hot and spicy, you can still have a tremendous amount of flavor in the food. I would make better Mexican food at home!   And the portion size of everything? Tiny. There was another reviewer who talked about the size of the sides that are ordered. She wasn't joking... The black beans are $6 and you get about 4 spoonfuls of beans. The rice is $5 and you get the same size: 4 spoonfuls of rice. I am talking about a size smaller than the smallest Chinese takeout rice container!  This is just a pathetic mark-up. Especially when there is nothing special about the rice or the beans. The beans were meant to be garlicky, and they just tasted like they were black beans out of the can. Rice was... Rice.   Boo :( I also ordered for our table of six people the chicken taquitos. I asked the server how many pieces came in one order. He held up three fingers and said three. I said that I would like to have two orders and he gave me a weird look. I said that I wanted each person to be able to try 1 taquito so whatever I needed to do to get just six pieces, that's what I wanted. He came back to me with two orders, each of them had six pieces. So, 12! And yes, we were charged for that. I mean, dude, know your product! The dessert options were very disappointing. If I am in a Mexican themed restaurant, I do not want the pecan pie or the strawberry shortcake pushed on me as the desserts that are the best here. The waiter just kept telling me to order those things. At least have something beyond flan that I can choose from. An interesting sopapilla? Creative churros?  Nope.. We skipped dessert and just got the hell out of there. I will not be going back and I will not be recommending this restaurant to anyone I speak to.

The nice thing is that they will text you once the table is ready. It took a long time for our food, and none of it was very impressive. I enjoyed the ceviche trio, but it really tasted like any standard ceviche. Mole trio was okay, felt underseasoned, and it was a pretty small portion considering the price. We ordered a side of rice and beans too. It was literally portioned for one, which is ridiculous considering the price of the sides. The rice was good -- might be the Carolina gold rice?  I also echo some of the other reviewer's comments about the service. We hardly saw our waiter, but the bus boy came by frequently and would interrupt conversations to ask if an empty dish needed removal. When we said yes, he would then leave (without taking it?!). The restaurant is LOUD, and my table was right by the walk-way, so other guests would frequently bump into my chair.

2016-07-02,3.0,"As soon as I finished my meal and wiped my mouth with a napkin, I began to think about what kind of rating I would give this place. The Girlfriend and I are huge fans of Rick Bayless' show and his guest appearances, we really wanted to love this place, even if every other high end Mexican restaurant experience had always disappointed us. Maybe Rick would pull it off. Le sigh. First strike: The tables are way too close together for a large dinner group, and at first I was told not to move the surrounding tables to make more room. Anyone who knows me knows I don't hide my feelings very well, and clearly the waitress could read my face. Eventually she just walked away and let me do whatever I wanted. Now that we had some space to move around and talk at any volume we liked, I felt more comfortable about my dinner experience to come, albeit a little perturbed that our waitress would even think to oppose me when she's supposed to be our server. The Girlfriend was clearly embarrassed and assured her mom and dad that everything was okay. Her dad looked a little uncomfortable and I nodded in agreement. Hopefully the food would be better.  Wrong. The dishes were bland and mediocre, good food for other restaurants that don't carry the Bayless banner. I ordered the mole and chicken and was surprised to taste how conflicted the chicken seasoning mixed with the sauce, creating a flavor profile that was wildly inconsistent and disappointing. This was all after an unfruitful trip to the paint store looking for a color for our bedroom, not wanting to pick anything that HuffPo said reflected negatively on our love life. I was hoping dinner would remedy all this. I was wrong.  But what really soured the whole experience was our busboy, if you could call a balding grown man that. He constantly circled the tables, never saying anything, refilling our water like every five minutes, literally interrupting conversations to reach over the table to fill someone's water, without saying please or excuse me or, I don't know, anything! The Girlfriend's saying something to her parents about feeling like she's not reaching her fullest potential because she read an article about a nine year old who knows twelve languages, but I can't jump in because this guy keeps coming over, spreading his nervous energy around. Like if he doesn't speak English or feel comfortable talking to customers, why have him on the floor at all? Just the look of this guy in his forties, with his white polo slightly blousing out of his pants, looking around for cups to fill and refusing to speak, took away my appetite. I literally could not finish my meal with him standing anxiously in the corner, waiting to be of use. I think The Girlfriend sensed my discomfort and said let's just go.

2016-06-30,5.0,"The only thing I knew about Frontera before going, was that friends who had been claimed it was absolutely incredible. I've gone to hyped up places before where the biggest thrill is standing in line only to be met by disappointment when you overly pay for mediocre food. Still though, we were excited to try it and made sure to keep open minds.   I didn't look over their menu ahead of time which isn't like me. I prefer to go in knowing exactly what I'm getting, that way the decision making part is over and I can simply relax and enjoy the meal.  We got there ten minutes before they opened and had to stand in a long line, but it moved quickly once they let us inside. The whole wait from street to table was 15-20 minutes tops.  Because it was a gorgeous day and we were on vacation, I threw caution to the wind and ordered the first thing to catch my eye which was the street food trio. Everything on the plate sounded foreign to me, but it's a James Beard award winning establishment after all so how bad could it be?  I also wanted a margarita but noticed none on the menu were frozen. I asked our server for a recommendation and he brought me the Topolo margarita. I still can't tell you what's in it, but it's shaken table side and goes down as smooth as water. It was easily the most refined and refreshing margarita I have ever had.  We also started with their freshly made chips and salsa. You get a roasted red and a green salsa (the green was by far our favorite). We wanted to bottle it so that we could take it home and put it on everything.  When my trio plate came out, I nearly laughed at how small the portions were for $18. One bite however completely changed my outlook. I have never had such delicious food. The seasonings were spot on, the complimenting sauces perfection, the meat tender, lord have mercy it was superb! Even more surprising was that I truly was full afterwards. My husband got a trio as well but the old school one with taquitos, ceviche, and Mexico City style quesadillas. He too was left full from the smaller servings, and he has a large appetite. We spent close to $100 for lunch, but in this case it exceeded expectations and was 110% worthwhile.  If you get the chance you need to RUN not walk, and try this gem out for yourself. I'm now convinced there is nothing chef RB could make that I wouldn't love. Mushrooms? Sign me up. Goat cheese? Let's do this. A shoe? Bring it! If he's cooking it, I'm eating it.",0.9954,0.811,0.149,0.04,0.5369130291005292

The guacamole was super smooth, like a mousse, with chunks of tomatoes and avocado. It was a really great guacamole and the salsas, of course, are terrific.  We all tried the specialty drinks...I got the fruit water, which had cucumber, lime and I think basil or cilantro. It was super refreshing...wish I had one now. A couple of folks got the limeade and one got the Rudy something, which was a tea-based drink with hibiscus.  For entrees we ordered a variety with a couple of people getting mole enchiladas, one person got skirt steak tacos, two people got the coconut shrimp (the thought it was too sweet) and I got the sea bass with escabeche sauce, rice and pickled purple onions. It was superb!  I think the sauce totally makes the dish. I added a side of fresh jalapeños and I was a happy camper.  I travel to Chicago a lot and am glad I finally tried Frontera Grill.

2016-06-16,2.0,"Swung by Chicago last month and made it a mission to check out Frontera.  I've heard all the critiques that Chef Bayless has gotten, I agree with a lot of them, but always appreciated his moments of openness and respect for Mexican culture/history/etc. (I'm Mexican myself).  As a Mexican person, I love authentic Mexican food, which is very regional, unique and nuanced, but I was looking forward to the spin applied on the food here.  The restaurant itself is nice, a bit kitschy, and the staff are incredibly kind and friendly.  We were seated quickly, as we had a reservation.  Our server immediately brought us to our table, and attentively described drinks, asked us for our preferences and made recommendations.  Relatively quickly, our drinks arrived, and they were fantastic.  My drink in particular, one of the mezcal drinks, was fantastic.  Everyone else was happy with their's as well.  We ordered a couple of appetizers, which came quickly.  The guacamole was great.  The ceviche trio? I believe, was okay.  I have to say that the one with tomato was particularly tasty, the others were okay, but overall, it was nothing I couldn't whip up at home pretty easily.  No offense. What I was really looking forward to was the Yellowtail Aguachile, again, I wanted to see the spin on dishes.  I have to say, I was underwhelmed.  It just wasn't much of anything.  It was spicy, limey, but really, the yellowtail just sat their, limp, and luke warm. Our dishes arrived soon after.  I have to say, throughout this, several of the wait staff would cruise by, say hello, make recommendations, etc.  THE WAIT STAFF IS AMAZING.  I ordered the Oaxacan style carne asada, and I should've resisted.  I have carne asada often, and was hoping to see a ""spin"" on it.  Again, nothing special, and nothing I couldn't do myself.  A family member ordered the shrimp in black bean chorizo sauce, which I debated in getting, but found it flavorless.  The sauce in particular, which would've been the ""spin,"" wasn't much of a sauce.  It was flakey and dry.  I will say, the kids menu (taquitos and quesadilla) were great.  My kids loved them.  All in all, like I said, it was just okay, bordering on too pricey for what it was.  The ""spin"" wasn't much of a spin, which makes me want to recommend smaller, way less expensive Mexican restaurants.  Finally, I will say that whoever runs the restaurant (I understand it may not be Chef Bayless) should be careful with their choice in names for their drinks.  One of the drinks was called ""Manifest Destiny.""  I mean, you can't lift up Mexico and its cuisine on one end, and then use the theory/ideology that informed and led to the invasion and subsequent colonization of Mexico by the U.S..  It felt insensitive and a bit tone deaf.",0.9985,0.785,0.195,0.02,0.4934409340659341

I love oysters so when the types weren't listed on the menu, I inquired. The waiter could only say they had ""East and West Coast"". I get more specifics when I go to Mariano's where I pay $1.25 each as opposed to here at $3 each.  Also, this is a Mexican restaurant and we weren't offered chips/salsa. Thinking it was an appetizer that needed to be ordered, I waited for menus(which took forever) and there none to be ordered.  Lastly, there was a young gentleman who appeared to be the manager walking to tables to make sure everything was as expected. He never visited our table even though we ordered drinks, oysters, main courses and deserts. He certainly had plenty of time.  We threw down $190.

After much anticipation, the hostess finally seats you almost on top of your dining neighbors. We could hear their conversations, and them, probably ours. So, being fair, this subtracts from the actual dining experience.

Reservations made a few weeks ago, I asked for a text confirmation, but instead I received two phone calls. Upon entering the restaurant we were taken to a table, but the wait staff didn't seem as engaged or cared about helping with the order.  One nice thing, my husband is allergic to tomatoes so those were placed on the side, but beyond that, it was a lack luster experience. The appetizer was good, with the exception of too much salt tossed on one item. The main course came out and then before we could dive into it, the waiter took it away as he'd forgotten to take off the tomatoes. We were confused at first, but when he replaced the dish he mumbled something about tomato sauce. Very strange though. The wine service woman said she had access to wines from Bayless' next door restaurant, so we were excited to see what might appear on her specials. She never returned. The waiter came back, said ""So you're sticking with water?"" didn't wait for an answer and walked off with the drink list.  For the price point and hype, I would have liked my food warmer, the atmosphere less cafeteria feeling, and the wait staff nicer.  Luckily, there are many other restaurants in Chicago.

2016-03-27,4.0,"Frontera Grill is Rick Bayless' flagship restaurant, and one that I had been wanting to visit for many years. Bayless is considered one of the top experts in Mexican food, having lived in Mexico for several years back in the 1980's. He continues to take his staff on yearly ""food missions"" to Mexico to this day. Bayless has won a James Beard Award for best chef, Midwest Region. His restaurant Topolobampo has 1 Michelin star. He also won Top Chef Masters, Season 1 in 2009. The meal began with a complimentary small dish of seasoned nuts, including peanuts and pepitas (pumpkin seeds). They were nicely spiced, but not hot. Warm corn tortillas were also provided with two types of salsa. The tortillas were nice and fluffy with some texture to it. The salsas had some spice to it, but again was not hot. I really liked the green salsa, although the red was also good. The Topolobampo Tortilla Soup ($8) is different than most tortilla soups, in that the broth is clear rather than having tortillas blended into the soup itself. The soup seemed to lack was good, but the pasilla chiles did not impart a lot of heat. The chicken remained moist, but the soup seemed to lack any real depth of flavor. I prefer the chicken tortilla soup by Dean Fearing immensely. The Classic Queso Fundido ($8) is a skillet of melted Jack cheese, roasted peppers and green chorizo. The cheese was melty good and stretchy, the peppers adding just a bit of punch, while the chorizo added some texture and meatiness to the dish. I really liked this dish, and would order it every time. The Mexican Street Corn was good, but was a little disappointing as it seemed too ""formal"". The corn was not slathered in mayo to the point of being overloaded. There was an ample amount of queso fresco however. The addition of epazote added some herbal pungency. The Chile Rellenos were incredibly huge. Battered and nicely fried, they were swimming in a pool of tomato based sauce. They were nicely stuffed with shredded pork and cheese. The dish came with a side of black beans and rice, which were also good. This is a solid dish, and is very hearty. The Carne Asada Brava included slices of perfectly cooked, tender and flavorful beef. It was paired with a sweet tamale, which could have been a little sweeter for my taste. The salsa also imparted a lot of flavor but not much heat. With my years of anticipation to eat at Frontera Grill, it fell slightly short of my expectations. The food was good, but was not ""wow, what have I been waiting for all of these years!"" good.

They sat us downstairs - which I didn't know they even had.  I won't say I'm a fan of the downstairs - it definitely feels as if you're downstairs, but I will say that I didn't feel neglected at all by the wait staff.  It is more quiet and subdued downstairs. We ordered another round of drinks to start the meal off right.  My husband switched to the Blue Agave Margarita - which he thought was okay.  I stuck with the true shining star of the Champagne Margarita! We started with the Coctel Campechano Ceviche - which was a combination of crab, shrimp, octopus, squid, and tuna ceviche in an avocado sauce.  We loved it and finished it quickly.  It's not a large portion - I will say - but quite tasty.

I made the reservations 3 weeks in advance, we got seated right away which was great, the hostess/waiters/all staff were amazing. The ambiance was really mediocre, nothing fancy at all, and the service was good but the food was average at best. Guacamole really not impressed, just your standard with a few mixins, drinks were good, mole enchiladas we're tasty but again nothing mind-blowing. Ceviche was too watered down in our opinion and all the chips were stale, nothing fresh. And now lastly this crane asada steak platter that came highly recommended shocked me the most. The meat had so much fat, each bit took about 45 secs to take down due to texture and the taste was again lacking. The best thing we had all night were the plantains that were made well. Overall, a 3 star experience- doesn't live up the hype, food was average, and safe to say doesn't deserve to be one of Chicago's elite places to eat.",0.9915,0.744,0.214,0.042,0.47242447516641073

Luckily it's restaurant week in Chicago so this is the best time to try a new restaurant for a good deal! My  experience here was beyond expectations! This is definitely my new favorite Mexican restaurant.  My husband and I decided to get the winter salad, ceviche, oaxacan style carne asada, fish in peanut green mole sauce, tres leches cake, and sorbet. My husband and I were able to share everything and we both enjoyed everything given to us. But Our favorites we're the ceviche and the oaxacan entree. The steak was creek stone meat (which is halal!!!) was cooked and seasoned perfectly! The ceviche was the best ceviche I've ever had and I don't even like ceviche! I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu! My husband especially liked the wide variety of sauces given especially the habanero sauce (which is good but way too hot for me personally). In terms of service our waiter and the staff were excellent! Our server was attentive and very knowledgable. The rest of the staff took our jackets, filled our glasses, and made sure to clear empty plates.  In terms of pricing it's definitely more on the higher end of the scale. But it's definitely a great meal. It's a date night or celebration type of place. I personally wouldn't take my kids here because it seems more like an adults only place and I didn't see any kids there for dinner (but it was 7:30 on a school night).  But it's a loud of enough place to take your kids if you'd like.

They still had a 45 minute wait for a table, but plenty of space and full menu at the bar, so we were okay with that! They even held our luggage at the coat check for us. I really should stop reading other reviews before I write one. Lots of grumblers and complainers. All I can say is that my wife and I loved everything. Here's what we got:  - Blue agave margarita for her, Oaxacan gold mezcal for me. Small glasses, but potent. Mine had spicy salt, which I'll probably skip next time. The drink was good but I didn't see the point of that.  - Classic queso fundido. Lots of cheese, meat and onions and some small tortillas with red and green salsa. Very flavorful, but we had to fit a lot in those few tortillas. We managed though! Loved it.  - Old school Frontera trio for her. She subbed out ceviche for enchiladas potosinas since she's not big on fish, much less raw fish. Also came with tiny quesadillas and chicken taquitos, and fresh guacamole. She doesn't usually like guacamole but liked hers, I think because it was very fresh and not acidic at all. Mostly just avocado with a few tomatoes.  - Shrimp a la Diabla for me. I don't usually get shrimp at restaurants since it's easy to make at home (and she is allergic to shellfish) but they were perfectly made here. The sauce, rice, and spinach were perfect, simple additions. I'm still working on my spice tolerance, and definitely suffered a bit, but it was worth it.  - Flan duo for dessert. The two flans aren't identical (on purpose) and one was a bit more gooey than the other. I liked them OK. Would probably pick something else next time.  Overall we loved it, knowing going in that it's a celebrity chef restaurant downtown in a major city, which means it's expensive and you have to wait. If you can't get over that skip it.

We walked over and arrived around 5:10 and were put on the list for 5:40. At 5:20, when they open the doors, we were immediately seated in the Dining Room. Bravo! Skipping the obligatory ""chips and guac"" we went straight to the Ceviche Trio and the ""Street Food Trio"". The ceviche was easily the best I've had with a nice textural and flavor progression between the three. The ""Street Food Trio"" was good, but clearly the Ceviche was  the star.  Next up was the Mole Poblano Enchiladas. These were perfectly executed with a nice balance between the chicken and the mole. Definitely worth trying. For Entres we ordered the Chicken in Xico Mole, Carnes al Carbon, and the Snapper al la Verecruzana. In a few words, order the Chicken! It was easily the best dish of the evening, and one of the best dishes I've ever had. With perfectly cooked chicken and a truly unique mole I can't imagine anyone not liking it. Both the Carnes and the Snapper were as expected, correctly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and nicely plated...but the Chicken is on another level. While other ""Mexican"" restaurants may do a few dishes better, almost none has the depth and breadth of Frontera Grill. Rick and his crew cover almost every region with consistently well executed plates and a menu that is never stale. Impressive, considering Frontera is closing on 30 years in the business! The reason is simple, Rick and Deann still have a passion for what they do and care about what comes out of the kitchen. To the point, we were there on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving and saw Rick come out of the back to walk the room. This on a night most chefs at his level would have handed it off to the crew!

My companions and I all agreed the food was good, but not outstanding.  I ordered the mole poblano enchiladas.  This is far above anything you are likely to get at most Mexican-style restaurants, except perhaps in New Mexico where I learned to appreciate mole enchiladas.  The mole at Frontera Grill was clearly a complex mix of spices and herbs, as expected, but it was too sweet and left a cloying taste after each bite that needed to be balanced out with refried beans.  The heat from the poblanos was just right, but the sweetness of the mole kept this dish from being outstanding.   On a more positive note, the guacamole was excellent.  Also, the bar area has great atmosphere; the dining room not so much despite great Mexican folk art on the walls.",0.9932,0.746,0.203,0.051,0.5342089947089949

He told me the menu changes frequently but this item had never been taken off the menu (perhaps it should be).  The steak was burnt on the outside and pink to medium in the inside. Worst of all, quarter of the steak was marbled fat. Definitely wouldn't recommend this dish. Dessert was okay. I had the chocolate pecan pie. Nothing to write home about.

2015-11-07,3.0,"I've lived in Chicago for 8 years now, and I finally made an effort to eat here this week. My husband was home this week so we decided to go at 5 on a weeknight so bypass the lines. When we arrived, we put our names down and waited at the bar because they don't actually seat until 5:40. So keep in mind if you show up at 5, you won't actually get to start eating until more like 5:40. My husband had a mezcal cocktail called the paloma and I had the topolo margarita. Drinks were delicious, but small for 12 dollars. They shake them at your table, but you don't get to drink what's left in the shaker..they take the shakers away with them. Sad. I would have liked those extra few sips. While we were waiting we had an order of chips and salsa ($4). That's right. No free chips and salsa at this Mexican restaurant. The serving of salsa was a bit stingy. You get a couple tablespoons of red and couple tablespoons of green salsa. We had some chips left over that were feeling pretty sad over the lack of salsa. When we were seated at 5:40, our waiter was friendly and quick. We ordered the street food trio and the wood fired al carbon (duck, chicken, steak  make your own tacos) plate. The street food trio was tasty and flavorful. The tacos were kind of meh. Tasty but nothing mind blowing. We could have used a few more tortillas as well. Everything was good, but we kind of felt like the tacos at our favorite hole in the wall were more tasty and much cheaper.  We had some leftover meat from the taco platter that we took home and ate it for breakfast with fried eggs the next day so that was a nice little bonus. With drinks and tip, our bill was about 110.  Glad we tried it, but we don't plan on coming back.",0.9774,0.794,0.136,0.07,0.5182325182325183

I was also a bit turned off by the fact they charge for chips and salsa.  Come on, what place charges for chips and salsa??   The star dish of my night was actually the dessert.  The Duo Flan came out beautiful with a traditional vanilla Flan and a very non-traditional chocolate flan that tasted more like a mousse.  They had marinated pears on top with hibiscus flower petals and chocolate sauce covering the plate.  This was a VERY good dessert.  I happily finished it all.

Our server wouldn't really describe the dishes we asked about sufficiently for us to make informed decisions (his description of a shrimp dish-- ""It's spicy""), not that we could hear him very well, so we just had to punt.  We waited longer for our food than we were given to eat it-- one of the servers cleared all of the plates, glasses, chips, salsas, and tortillas while one of our party was still eating, and a few others would have ordered another drink to finish off the chips and salsa. My water glass was never refilled..  We might have ordered dessert and coffee, but the menus were passed out, 2 minutes later, the server came back asked for our order, and when we said we hadn't had time to consider, he took away all of the menus. Truly terrible, pushy service from impatient and grumpy servers who had no time for making guests feel comfortable-- it's get in, get out.  The music was great, but too loud for conversation. My dish was my go-to, the chicken with mole. The mole was delicious, but there was not enough to coat the dust dry 4 slices of chicken (about 1/4 of a whole chicken breast). The squash tasted like frozen puree and there was too much of it and the crispy eggplant was soggy.  I think that carefully prepared, with some attention to each dish it might have been excellent, but it was not.  So, what did I like enough to merit two stars?  The bar. The art work and music were wonderful. The bar stools were a challenge.  The cocktail menu was interesting, the non-alcoholic beverages equally so.  My party enjoyed the margaritas and beers, I enjoyed a limeade mix (excellent), and great service in the bar.   This was my second time at Frontera (last time was many, many years ago), and now I remember why I hadn't gone back.

The drinks were good.  Small, expensive, but tasty.  Plan for about $12 per drink.  They have a nice beer selection, including various Chicago and mid-west beers for a much more reasonable price. We ordered the guacamole, as well as the chips and salsa.  The chips were great.  The red salsa was slightly smokey, but otherwise pretty bland.  The salsa verde was better, but still not great.  The guacamole was incredibly bland.  Where is the heat?  I mean, seriously. Alright, this place is supposed to be all about the carne asada and the mole.  So, I got the mole trio and my friend got the carne.  The carne was good - tender and cooked well.  Quite nice.  The mole trio was...interesting.  The traditional mole was nice, but the other two were underwhelming.  Again, almost no heat. The chocolate pecan pie was great, however.  Probably the highlight of the meal, with a possible exception of the carne asada. My main gripe was the service.  Terrible!  20 minutes to get drinks.  More than an hour for the server to come back and ask if we wanted another round of drinks.  Want some additional chips for the guac or salsa?  Probably easier to run down to the 7-11 and get yourself a bag of Doritos.  It was a solid 15 minutes or more between visits from the server, and as much as 45 in some cases.  I'm all for not being constantly bugged, but that was ridiculous.   In summary, the food is amazingly bland for Mexican, over priced and the service is some of the worst I have ever had.  With so many other options in the city, you would do well to skip Frontera.",0.9945,0.745,0.194,0.061,0.6071469907407407

2015-09-15,2.0,"The Skinny: went in for lunch and ordered the street food trio, tacos al carbon trio and the mole trio - all were okay but nothing special (3) service/ambience: it's okay - nothing special, the front desk needs to be better at communicating wait times (3) value: pricey for what it is.  I just want to get it out there before I review Frontera Grill.  I'll be honest. I've never been terribly impressed with high end Mexican restaurants. Coming from the Southwest where there are exceptional Mexican local (aka ""hole in the wall"") eateries for very reasonable prices, I am even more leery. But given that it was Rick Bayless with his renowned mole, I was willing to give it a shot. Ehhh... after this meal, definitely had better. We started off with the street food trio, shared the big wood grilled Tacos al carbon trio, and the mole trio. The street food trio was disappointing. The only good thing on the three was the sopes rancheros with the well seasoned meat and interesting fried texture of the masa boats. The rest were not memorable or flavorful at all. Kinda of disappointing for $17. The big wood grilled tacos al carbon trio comes with grilled steak, chicken and duck. Served with on a platter with a ton of green onions (I mean a ton!) and grilled shishito peppers, the large platter of meat was only served with a few small sized corn tortillas. Huh? WTF? I am not sure if we could ask for more but our server did not offer more at any time. The meat itself was okay - the chicken was a bit dry. The stand out was the steak with the slightly charred flavor. However was it the most flavorful meat ever? Not really. Added to the fact that the guacamole was really bland (mushed up avocado with some tomato without enough acidity makes this no es bueno) and it was served without salsa or even some cilantro/onion combo, this dish was rather disappointing and bland. For $34, there was plenty of food but it just wasn't that good. The Mole trio ($19) was also kind of a let down. The moles were kind of bland - I expected more a complex flavor profile but no... they were kind of boring. There was minimal heat, lack of aromatics and seasoning. The only one I liked out of the three was the green mole with Oaxacan green mole. The rest I could have done without.  Service wise, it was okay. Our server was pretty good about getting the orders right but kind of seemed overwhelmed with the number of tables. She didn't really check up on us regarding the food which was kind of disappointing considering the caliber of restaurant this place is supposed to be.  The host station in the front is kind of weird. We didn't have reservations but we checked in and was told that the wait times were 1 hour. They said that they would text us when the table was ready. We checked in about 45 minutes later before they could text us and we were immediately seated. Very odd. The biggest disappointment is that I've had really good Mexican before with great, bright, bold flavors. Tacos al pastor sliced fresh off a spit. Carne asada and lengua off a grill with warmed fresh tortillas. Complex salsas with different flavor profiles. This place just doesn't deliver at all. I would hate to think that people who come here after watching Rick Bayless' shows will think this is what real Mexican food is about. Because it isn't.

It may be that we were just so beyond hungry that we didn't have time to savor the food.... My biggest recommendation is to make a reservation. Frontera takes walk ins. Topolobampo does not. If you can't make a reservation, get there at 4:30. Frontera opens at 5:00.",0.9661,0.839,0.111,0.05,0.6057246376811594

I said the door says you open at 5 p. she said yes but we don't seat until 5:20??? Then if we wanted the main dining room I would have to wait until 5:30??? I said the resturant is empty why would we have to wait. Her reason was we don't seat everyone at once.

We decided to stay at the bar.  We ordered the 20 hour smoked brisket with mashed potatoes and vegetables; and Oaxan style Carne Asada made with Prime Steak served with plantains and black beans. I definitely liked the brisket more that the Carne Asada. The Carne Asada turned out to be a tougher piece of meat that we anticipated. The plantains were amazing. The margaritas were great!  Our bartender provided great service.

Growing ip watching his cooking shows has left me a Mexican food loving gal and so interested in the different ways Rick experiments with this  type of food. He is a household name and his restaurant is a delight. A word to the wise, they fill up quickly with reservations so call a few days early for big parties or if you are in a small group you can take a chance on one of their few tables available for walk ins. We took our chance around 6pm on a Tuesday and got a great table outside on the patio. My friend and I wanted to try a few items so we ordered 2 trios to split. The mole trio came with 2 mole poblano enchiladas with a nice dark and rich mole, my favorite of the three and then it came with two cute little bowls filled with a fresh green mole and fresh veggies and the other with pork in a tomato based Yucatecan pipian sauce. The green sauce was very tomatillo-ish and not exactly my favorite flavor but if you like tangy tomatillos this ones for you. The Yucatecan sauce was very mild and had a nice flavor with the pork. These two dishes came with a corn tortillas to put the pork and veggies in. We also ordered chips and salsa so that we could sop up the yummy guac that came with the taquitos and the tomato Yucatecan sauce, plus the chips came with 2 salsas a red and green that varied in smokiness and tanginess. For drinks we each ordered a beer, they have a fantastic list of tequilas and specialty cocktails calling my name but with out ""street food"" I just felt like a light beer and ordered a local saison infused with Meyer lemons, it was very refreshing! I also tasted the salted beer brewed with coriander... It was a little salty and so I passed but liked the idea. Now onto the best part--dessert!! OMG... We of course ordered two to share and i fell in love with the sweet corn ice cream served with corn tortas and caramel corn. I didn't like the tortas very much but the ice cream was amazing! I also ordered the raspberry sorbet with fresh raspberries and a mexican chocolate soup, it was served with an edible petunia and was very refreshing, a great end to a fantastic meal.",0.9983,0.782,0.218,0.0,0.5257000000000001

To start off, the place has no parking (which is common for Downtown), but it has an extremely convenient Valet for only $14 plus tip.  Also, unless you want to eat outside, you'll want to set up reservations at least four days in advance or you'll end up waiting 1-2 hours.   The hostesses were professional, but not overly friendly.  Our waiter was ok, but we've had better.  The busboy (who was extremely friendly and efficient) actually did most of the work and we would have preferred just having him take our orders too. The bathroom was so small that there was only enough room for two stalls.  Every time someone entered the bathroom, the door would hit the back of the person using the urinal or completely take out someone washing their hands. The food was tasty, but the portions are extremely small for the price.  We wanted to like the place and give it a higher rating, but we've had much better food in the bordering states and in Mexico for a fraction of the cost (everything was about ten times what we normally pay for similar dishes).  Plus, $35 for a margarita is just plain silly (even if they shake it at the table).  We think that this place really caters to patrons that have never experienced authentic Mexican food and just want to try some ""safe"" versions.   We are torn about the rating for this place.  We go back and forth between 2 and 3 stars.  We've had better food at better prices, so it goes into the 2 category.  However, we feel that it deserves an extra star for taking a new approach to Mexican food (even if its just making smaller portions and putting micro greens on top).  It was a fun novelty, but we would never return and have no interest in trying his other establishments.  We'll just stick to watching him on TV.",0.9605,0.854,0.099,0.047,0.42170686456400747

Unfortunately at this point, I had been waiting so long for the food I could have cared less and just dealt with it. Two of my friends tried the Street trio, thinking it would be enough for a meal. It is not...  Very small portion size for that, granted it is listed as food for sharing. Overall:  Overpriced, good flavors, terrible service. Gimmicky.

The accompanying squash blossom tortitas were delicious. I ended up sending the dish back because of the quality of the fish.  I just didn't feel safe eating it.  My husband enjoyed the red mole enchilada, but didn't like the other two.  The drinks here are fantastic though.  Overall, we had better food at Xoco next door.",0.9821,0.765,0.178,0.057,0.43666666666666665

Some interesting earthy flavors, almost like a light mole. Tomatillo spicy sauce is great. Pickled onions are a great foil and the black beans are out of this world, so fresh.

I typically request no cream or cheese and opt for vegetarian, because Mexican food in LA is overloaded with grease and super heavy. Chef Richard explained that's not how they make food at Frontera. All of the ingredients are fresh and locally sourced. They make their own corn masa, tortillas, salsas. The food is delightfully fresh and surprisingly light.  Menu changes monthly to reflect seasonal ingredients. The cocktails are fantastic. I loved my grapefruit mezcal cocktail and my husband's homemade gin & tonic was fantastic.

My shrimp mole dish was good but sure not worth $25.  My chip appetizer were some of thickest, oily chips I have ever eaten.  Pretty bad in my opinion.  The salsa's they were served with were mighty fine but also barely there.  I found it very difficult to dip the chip in the size bowl they presented in.  Pouring them on the chip was a more appropriate method.

While the city never fails to impress, our restaurant choice proved to be a letdown given our expectations. The Good:  Our server was fantastic. The salsa & chips were tasty but the serving size is small. I guess they don't want you to get too full on the appetizers. The margaritas were great. The Chicken in Green Garlic entree was delicious. The Bad: Three of our four entrees were disappointing. The Carne Asada Brava was over-spiced, something seemed wrong with the marinating and the flank steak was unacceptably tough.  The Striped Bass was overcooked and mushy and it wasn't served warm. Bad. The accompanying mushrooms tasted good and became the main focus of the plate. The Duck in Mole was also on the cold side. The taste was dominated by the chiles instead of being a well-combined set of flavors. We planned on having dessert but after the entrees we opted to go elsewhere. It was crowded and beggars can't be choosers so we accepted a table that was a real squeeze and too close to others to be comfortable, a bad feature of many of their tables.

I ordered the chilaquiles with tomatillo sauce and scrambled eggs and a side of corn pancakes.I didn't actually know what chilaquiles were when I ordered it but I'll never order it again. It's kind of weird to eat soggy tortillas. The common thing with the dishes at Frontera is saltiness. If my chilaquiles weren't so darn salty I would have ate more of it. My eggs were salty because they soaked up the salty tomatillo sauce. The corn pancakes were salty too even with syrup on them.  The meals were typical restaurant prices otherwise I would have been really upset about my visit.

2015-04-22,3.0,"Oh man, I'm so torn here. Frontera Grill has been hyped a ton and I had super high expectations going into it. Knowing we would be in town, we made reservations about a month in advance and were seated right when we arrived. The restaurant is u-shaped with the main dining room on one side and the bar on the other. The tables are super close together, but we were lucky enough to get an end table on a crowded evening. Since we were starving, we placed orders for margaritas (blue agave & topolo) and chips and guac right away. The menu is pretty extensive and we had a hard time deciding what to order. Our server was super helpful and we landed on the carne asada brava and the striped bass in green mole, per his recommendation. I was a bit hesitant about the carne asada since it's marinated in habanero and my spice tolerance is low, but our server assured me it was a 4/10 on the spice meter.  The bass arrived first, and looked delicious, but after one bite, we realized the temperature was off. The dish was barely lukewarm and who wants to eat lukewarm fish? We asked them to bring the temperature up a bit, so they whisked it away just as the carne asada arrived. About that carne asada....HOLY HELL was it spicy! Between the heat and how chewy the flank steak was, I could barely choke it down. Again, we hailed our server to let him know and he promptly took it away and replaced it with the oaxacan-style carne asada which was a super tender rib-eye packed with flavor. The hot bass finally reappeared and it ended up being delightful, yet understated. We particularly enjoyed the mashed potatoes and maiitake mushrooms on the plate.  They comped us another round of margaritas, and we finished off the night with a flan duo. The service was top notch, but the food was just ok, given all the hype. If I'm paying $25+ for an entree, it should nearly blow my socks off....",0.9873,0.796,0.143,0.061,0.5196171802054155

I have food allergies, gluten and dairy, so I told the waiter and asked for his suggestions on items that I could enjoy given my limitations. He was clueless. He provided random suggestions but wasn't confident in his responses. We ordered an appetizer, taquitos, and I asked that the dairy be put on the side so my husband could still enjoy the entire dish. Well the app showed up with all the ingredients on it. The service was terrible, I would have asked him to remake it but he wasn't around and we got sick of waiting. The evening was one big waiting game and the food was lackluster. The suburban crowd loves this place, and yeah it's a nice step up from the Olive Garden, but I won't be going back.

Food: great experience.  The shrimp empanadas were light, fluffy, slightly crispy splashed with a spicy onion salsa verde that was the right amount of heat.  Made you grab your Blue Agave margarita, which you will need at least 2 of after taking a sip.  This is a purist margarita, damn good tequila with a little lime, shaken table side and a lot of salt.  Highly recommended.  The Topo Margarita has limonada, so a little sweeter, also good.  Dinner was the Stripped Bass and Carne Asada.  The green mole on the white flaky bass was delicious and the anejo mashed potatoes & mushrooms added a mix of complementary flavors.  The carne asada had a fantastic rub/marinade.  As far as steak goes, it was good, but not a steak you would get at any fine steakhouse in chicago.  Plantains with the meat were fantastic (I'm a sucker for plantains).  Dessert was the bread pudding with a very interesting queso flavored ice cream.  Also good.   2. Service: our waiter was great, describing dishes & drinks, very knowledgeable.  Food and drinks timed out well.  The key here was Kyle (manager I believe).  IF YOU HAVE A GROUPON, YOU MAY NOT HAVE A RESERVATION.  So there have been problems booking Frontera through the groupon website.  Just because groupon reserves a table for you, does not mean Frontera has accepted the reservation.  They have limited room.  THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM.  I don't know whose fault it is (I can guess).  BUT, Kyle took care of the situation.  I called to see if we could come a 1/2 hour early and found out, there was no reservation.  Despite my frustration (reservation booked months ago, had a babysitter, etc), Kyle was calm and collective, and re-ran our groupon through the system, and was able to confirm (the reservation had never come through on frontera's end).  They only have room for a handful of groupon reservations a night (they take very few reservations to begin with).  So we got in and had a great meal.  Kyle came over to the table to check on us as well.  Again, very professional, great customer service.  He also offered a similar package to what groupon gave us for dinner that night (if he couldn't get the groupon to work), and then we would have gone through groupon for a refund (a very realistic alternative).  It all worked out, and I thank Kyle for that (but not groupon!).",0.9911,0.792,0.152,0.057,0.5547767857142858

2015-02-27,5.0,"One of my favorite restaurants and quite possibly my favorite restaurant in Chicago, I have yet to experience a restaurant like Frontera anywhere else in the country. Over the course of a few visits, standouts have been: Tortilla soup ($8.50): remains one of my favorite soups ever, the broth is fantastic and the tortilla strips, crema, avocado and chicken come together perfectly. Mole poblano enchiladas ($12): one of my favorites, I love Frontera's mole poblano and these enchiladas are the perfect pairing to really let the dark, roasty, slightly sweet mole come through. Striped bass in almond mole ($25): absolutely loved this dish, the portion was generous and the almond mole was smooth, nutty, and slightly sweet, perfect for the tender striped bass. Squash that came on the side was outstanding. Duck in date mole ($25): Duck breast came in long tranches and was perfectly cooked. Date mole was complex with roasty flavors of date and nutmeg, very slightly sweet. Mole trio ($23): another standby, I am a huge fan of mole and especially loved the mole poblano enchiladas and root veggies in green mole. Pork in yellow mole was also tasty, but less interesting than the other two. Holiday empanada ($8): warm, flaky empanada filled with some sort of warm cranberry compote. I was blown away by the phenomenal homemade chestnut ice cream that came with it. Duo of flan ($8): traditional vanilla and coconut. Both flans were the perfect consistency, the coconut was especially delicious and the crumbled (lemon?) cookies added flavor and texture. EDIT: Frontera is now tied with Longman & Eagle for my favorite brunch in Chicago. Bajio-style eggs ($13): A creative, delicious take on eggs benedict. Instead of the standard english muffin or biscuit, these poached eggs rest on two incredible masa cakes that are slightly crispy and mealy. The chorizo on top is extremely flavorful, and the jalapeno cream sauce is absolutely perfect with this dish. One of the best, most memorable brunch dishes I've had in a while. Enchiladas in mole ($15): Make sure you ask for a side of extra mole poblano! These chicken enchiladas are always great with Frontera's signature mole, which is dark, roasty, slightly chocolatey and sweet. Even the black beans on the side are noticeably delicious, especially when topped with a little extra mole. I really appreciate this dish during brunch. Gorditas ($13) was also excellent, the black bean sauce is addictive. Their guacamoles are good, but I'd really rather pay a few extra bucks for an extra entree. Whatever tamales Frontera has on offer are pretty much excellent across the board. I also remember trying the queso fundido with duck, the street food trio, and guacamole which were all well prepared, just not as memorable. Never tried any of the taco options. Reservations are still hard to come by here, and for good reason, I'd gladly go for brunch, lunch or dinner any day.",0.9992,0.746,0.248,0.006,0.6411040787623067

2015-02-09,2.0,"It matters very little how many stars I give Frontera. It is a well-lauded institution and in many ways it deserves the huzzahs. I've gone since it opened and still remember my first meal there and where I sat. Over the last few years, I've been nagged by an essential and unhappy truth about the place: no one at the front desk gives a rip about customers; in fact I don't think they even like them. They have turned the experience of walking into Frontera into a total hash-house experience and do not do one single thing to make you feel welcome or appreciated as a guest. You walk up and instead of a smile or a hello, they say ""how many?"" and bark out an order: go to the bar or whatever. Once at the table things improve; the service usually is pretty good and delivered with what seems like genuine warmth.  Our last visit deserves a special call out for heinous behavior by management, an attitude that pretty much squarely lands in the land of unforgivable. We were standing in line, waiting for the front door to open. It was a warmish winter day, hovering right at about 31F after an afternoon that had been sunny and mid 30s. This is only important in that it caused the snow from Frontera's awning to melt and drip to the sidewalk, causing a slick of black ice for homeward-bound pedestrians. Within a span of 3 minutes, two people completely wiped out, ass plants on the ice. Five more caught themselves before hitting the ground. We called the desk by phone to explain because the desk crew makes a game of not making eye contact with those in line; they actually hung up when we mentioned there was ice on the sidewalk. When another person fell, we finally pantomimed enough angst that someone deigned to come out. We explained the issue and he said, and I quote: ""I'll tell building management to clean it.""  How many ways can I say ""major jackwad?"" He did come out a few minutes later and scatter salt but the 'it's not my problem' attitude speaks volumes about where management's head exists at Frontera. Definitely not in a ""customer first"" universe.  I'll go back and as has been the case for the last 10 years, I'll scratch my head about why the top tier of people who work at Frontera hate their jobs so much. Happily, they can be left behind for the more welcoming experience that unfolds in the dining room.",0.9813,0.859,0.112,0.029,0.467274052478134
2015-02-06,5.0,"I've been here before when I was young and poor and anti ""weird"" combinations and so I ordered something plain and cheap and didn't really get to appreciate the awesomeness of the food here. Luckily, I have returned since, enticed by a Groupon deal.  The deal provides you and your friend two margaritas, a street food item to share, and two entrees. I unfortunately could not have any of the margaritas because they all contained some form of orange liqueur and I am weirdly allergic to oranges, but my friend said he was happy to have two, and so I ordered the Paloma. The waiter described the drink to me as he was pouring it into the martini glass and told me it would be spicy because the mezcal is infused with peppers for two weeks.  Our street food item was the pork tinga tacos and we accepted the offer to have it come with some spicy salsa on the side. The pork was perfection. I nearly ruined my second taco with a healthy helping of habanero sauce, not realizing just how spicy it would be. My mouth burned. My lips swelled. But I finished the taco, and am still able to say that I enjoyed it, mainly because I felt like a badass. And the Paloma? Not spicy at all. All I tasted now was refreshing grapefruit. My entree was the Oaxacan Carne Asada. Omg. Huge piece of meat. Sweet plaintains. A pile of black beans. And guacamole. I was in heaven. Ate everything but half of the beans. Steak was cooked to my liking, the guacamole was amazing, and the plantains were a nice bit of sweetness. The tortillas that come with the meal were useful as well- to make a couple more tacos with more of that awesome habanero sauce. That's right- I became immune. My friend enjoyed his Carne Asada Brava as well, though he said the tamales were on the bland side. For dessert, I tried their dessert margarita- the Cafe Tacuba, which was a cold coffee and chocolate concoction. Strong and very, very good. We also tried the flan duo because we clearly didn't have enough food, which was comprised of a vanilla flan and white chocolate flan. I much preferred the white chocolate flan, but both were light and creamy and delicious and we couldn't help but finish them both off. My only complaint about this place was the wait on everything. Reservation was at 9, but the table wasn't ready for a good 10-15 minutes. Then we had to wait a while for our waiter. Then our drinks, which came after the app. I felt like I was in a doctor's office. Once the food comes, however, it's worth the wait. Is it also worth the price?

The scary part about it is that I could have had 4-5 of them without realizing that I was actually consuming alcohol. Luckily I stuck to one. As an appetizer we had empanadas with crushed avocado and a mix of creme and hot sauce. Fantastic deep flavors and the right balance of textures. For an entree my wife and I shared the fish of the day (tilefish) and the striped bass. Both cooked to perfection with complementary sauces and a nice smokey char that fit the fish perfectly. Interestingly enough, the thing that set the tilefish off was the smoked potatoes in a cilantro creme sauce. I mean holy freaking cow that was amazing. I could literally just sit and eat a plate of that. For desert was had the duo of flan. Again perfect balance of flavor and texture. The often overly sweet custard desert was fairly mild with a sweet sauce, slightly bitter orange and a crunchy amaranth honey  crisp. Overall just an awesome meal.

When seated we ordered classic guacamole which came with two different salsas, all three of which were awesome with the perfectly home-made chips.  The Smoked Chicken Queso Fundido was good, but the cheese, when melted, was a little on the oily side.  Finally, my wife ordered Chicken & Black Beans for Making Little Tacos - very tasty, and I ordered the Carne Asada ""Brava"" which was marinated skirt steak (perfectly cooked and sliced thinly) with onions (meh, just ok) and sweet corn tamales that were out of this world!! The sweetness of the tamales went perfectly with the spiciness of the skirt steak.  I also ordered the Topolo margarita which was smooth and not overly sweet/sour...actually I had two of those : )  One important note; the tortillas.

I like to let people make decisions for me, and he was happy to do so. The salsas and guac are a must. Save room to split some of the small plates. I personally loved the sopes. For my entree I went the fish route and boy was I happy I did. Absolutely stunning and full of complimentary flavors. We finished with dessert (they surprised us with) and some Mexican hot chocolate. Then I was wheeled out to the car and brought home to decompress. One extremely special experience for us - my boyfriend and I celebrating our anniversary - was seeing Rick Bayless running the line. I felt like each dish was made with extreme care and compassion... You could taste it. Now, for the bad. I made my reservation months in advance online because it's been a struggle to get in. I got a call the day before from a host confirming my reservation for 2 and 8pm and was asked to call back - since he got my voice mail. When I called back I talked with another man who said he couldn't find my reservation. I spelled my name out, gave him all my info, told him I just got a message from someone... Finally he says, ""oh ya, here you are but you made your reservation at 5:30pm."" Now, mind you I have my email with my confirmation in front of me while he tells me this... I said no, I didn't. I work an hour away and won't even be home by 5:30 and the person who left the message had the correct time... I also have my confirmation email. He argues with me telling me that I made my reservation at 5:30. I persisted that I didn't and reiterated my evidence that I didn't. Finally, in a hurried and frustrates voice, he says, well I can get you in at 8:30 so I'll change the 5:30pm reservation you made, bye. I was so turned off that he spoke so rudely and acted as if he did me a favor when clearly the mistake was on his end. What it felt like was they bumped my reservation to squeeze someone else in and tried to get away with t. Totally not cool. When I got in the reservation he made for me was also for 4. Oy. Headache. Anyway that's it.  Go enjoy the food and keep your reservation confirmations- you just might need em!",0.8657,0.844,0.093,0.064,0.5763640873015873

2014-12-29,5.0,"There is much hype about one of Chef Rick Bayless' flagship restaurants here in Chicago. The question is...is the hype deserved or is it overrated? After having wanted to dine there for a couple of years, but never finding the time during a visit, we finally made it to Frontera Grill. The resounding answer is YES, the hype is worth it and NO the restaurant is not overrated. LOCATION & ATMOSPHERE Rick Bayless seems to dominate the block where Frontera Grill is located. The restaurant is collocated with two of Bayless' other restaurants: Topolobampo (high-end Mexican cuisine) and Xoco (fast-casual sandwich concept). Frontera is in the heart of tourist central and is flanked by such exciting culinary destinations as Rainforest Café and Maggiano's! It blows my mind that there were people dining and better yet WAITING to dine at these chain restaurants when such divine culinary art is happening all around these tourist traps here in Chicago. My gain, their loss is the way I look at it. It is still very much a pain to secure a reservation at Frontera as it primarily is a walk-in restaurant. They do offer few reservations for both lunch and dinner services. If you hate to wait and being in/near lines like I do, reservations in advance is the only way to go. You can always check the day or so before and if there have been cancellations you can snag one of those reservations. FOOD & BEVERAGE So, if you go to Frontera you absolutely have to try a margarita or two. They are delicious and there is a wide variety on the menu. From smoky mezcal-inspired concoctions to more traditional margaritas - there really is something for everyone. My 'at home' margarita recipe is from one of Bayless' cookbooks and my version is damn near close to what I was served at Frontera Grill. I saved my coin and only had one since I knew I could recreate something very similar at home. I had to test it out though to confirm! The food -- the food! As one would expect, this is where Frontera shines. We opted to explore the small plates/sharing portions of the menu versus having large entrees. This was the best way to go in my opinion as we got to try a little bit of everything.  As many a reviewer behind me has said - the Ceviche Trio is a must have item for the table. Each ceviche was fresh and unique - great flavor combinations. The 'Street Food Trio' is another great item to share at the table. We ordered some of the vegetable sides and were happy with each of our choices - the Modern Black Beans, the Red-Chile Braised Kale with Local Potatoes, and the Pickled Jalapenos were great accompaniments to our meal. I'm so glad we finally had the opportunity to visit Frontera Grill and this will absolutely go on our rotation of restaurants we visit when we are in Chicago again. As I'm re-reading my review (congratulations if you made it this far!) -- I can't even believe I didn't mention the INSANELY obnoxious family beside us. The mother's voice were like nails on a chalkboard and they were all so unnecessarily loud.

The fish was okay, but the side vegetable - romanesco was the first time I ever had and it was so delicate. The tacos are stellar - guacamole can never be this fresh, and the steak is just so juicy.

2014-12-17,4.0,"I've had wildly mixed experiences with Rick Bayless.  Loved Frontera Fresco, was underwhelmed by Xoco and actively disliked the Tortas Frontera at O'Hare. So how would Frontera Grill hold up? The food was quite good, but this place is crazy expensive.  With tax and tip, it ran us about $50/person.  It's slightly elevated Mexican food, man.  I feel like that total is high for what we ate. * Chips and salsa ($3) - If you've had the Frontera salsa you can buy at Whole Foods, this is the same deal.  You get a red and a green.  Sadly, they provide so little salsa.  It's like an eyedropper's worth.  I like to drown my chips, son!  The salsas are tasty, but I've had better chips elsewhere. * Classic Queso Fundido ($8) - Jack Cheese, garlicky roasted peppers, homemade chorizo.  I'm not a huge queso fundido fan.  This was alright.  Not a huge portion.  Maybe big enough for two people to share a couple bites. * Carne Asada Brava ($29) - Serrano-marinated grass-fed flank steak, salsa huevona (hand-crushed, grill-roasted tomatoes, jalapenos).  Grilled knob onions, sweet corn tamales.  This was a home run.  I speared my steak slices and shoveled them into a tortilla with a splash of hot sauce.  Very tasty.  Not much fat on the meat.  The sweet corn tamales are fairly flavorless. * Blue Agave Margarita ($12) - Milagro blanco tequila, cointreau, fresh lime juice.  Another huge score.  Smooth and strong.  This is a quality contender to the other excellent margarita in the neighborhood over at Cantina Laredo.   I was really disappointed in the look of the place.  It's cramped.  My girlfriend literally bumped into another diner when she leaned back in her chair. Frontera Grill has something of an identity crisis.  It kinda wants to slum it.  It kinda wants to be upscale.  If the food were upscale with cheap prices, that'd be one thing.  But the food can be hit-or-miss, the ambiance is lacking and the prices are high.

We have been trying to get into the Frontera Grill the last few times we were in Chicago with little luck trying to make reservations without weeks of notice. Tonight we decided to bite the bullet and wait! We waited a solid hour which was to be expected and was predicted by the hostess. Once seated I had high expectations. The guac and ceviche were good, nothing to blow your socks off but good! The cocktails were among the same vein, good but not incredible. I have a rule about attitude, which is not lacking at Frontera. If you've earned it with superior food, service, and cocktails I am all about the attitude! I love when a place is excellent and just knows it! Frontera Grill has not earned it. Out of our party of five two people were satisfied with their dinners. I had the carne asada which was solidly sub par. The meat was over cooked. Edgar (our waiter) told me that the meat had to be over cooked or it would have ended up chewy which makes me wonder what sort of low quality meat they are using. I went in expecting to love every bite and I walked out seriously dissatisfied. For the money go somewhere that tries a little harder, unfortunately celebrity restaurants seem to cater to a certain type of person.

2014-11-19,2.0,"So this was my second time at the restaurant.  The first time I went, about a year ago, I went just with my SO and we had a lovely time. I thought the food was really good, but I actually thought it was a little overhyped. The kale enchiladas I had were just fine. They didn't have much flavor, but they were very fresh and the texture was great. My SO's dish (some sort of duck) was definitely delicious. The guacamole is great, but a little overpriced. The service was fine, and the drinks were good, but nothing memorable. The second time I went, just a couple weeks ago, I brought my parents during their visit to Chicago. They both really wanted to try a Rick Bayless restaurant so I thought I'd try it again. The food was actually much better this time (my father and I had several small dishes and my mom and SO had some tacos - the duck and steak). However, what drove me to write this review was the AWFUL service. So my mother ordered the steak tacos. She cannot eat processed corn and told the waiter she was allergic to corn tortillas and requested flour. The waiter said that was fine. Then my SO ordered the duck tacos, and also requested flour tortillas because he just likes them better.  When the food comes out, my mom mentions that her tortillas taste a little corn-ish, but she just thought that was maybe how they were flavored. After eating one, the waiter comes over and brings a second dish of tortillas to her, announcing that these were the flour she requested. He did NOT apologize for the mix up. We then realized that my SO got flour to begin with, even though my mother is the one with the legitimate health concern surrounding corn tortillas (and she DEFINITELY mentioned that to the waiter)! But no apologies were given at all, and he just acted like that was supposed to happen. Additionally, my mom ordered a margarita. She loved it, and as such, finished it before the main courses came out. However, she was never asked if she wanted another one. The waiter (and another girl, a water filler I guess?) also came around several times to fill water glasses and would LITERALLY skip my mother's glass (even though it was emptier than the rest of ours). She only got water when we loudly lamented the fact that she had been passed over for water a third time. I'm not sure if Frontera just didn't like the looks of her or what, but that was the worst service I have ever seen someone give just a single person at a table of four.  Now luckily my mom isn't deathly allergic to corn tortillas, so we didn't have to go to the ER or anything, but she definitely gets very sick from eating processed corn and she was very unhappy that she was going to get sick because of a waiter's mistake, especially when we are spending that much money on dinner. I don't remember the waiter's name at this moment, but he knows who he is because my dad left a very angry note on the table when we left. I can only hope that he learned his lesson.

I'm a fan of the other gring@ with extensive knowledge of Mexican cuisine-- Diana Kennedy-- so it took me a minute to get into the wiry Rick Bayless. But I enjoy his books, lots of people think he's more accessible, and I tried and enjoyed his food at an airport before. On this trip, I intended to check out Xoco based on reviews here, but it was closed, so I wandered into Frontera Grill. The hostess explained that the bar seats are first come, first serve, so I sat at the counter, facing the wall (poor choice on my part, but solo dining is sometimes awkward). I waited a while for a menu, and the server offered his disculpas.  The restaurant is full of amazing Mexican folk art: beautiful etchings, hand carved sculptures, colorful paintings, and a day of the dead alter with photos of famous people who have recently passed. Even the bathroom is pretty, with the doors to the stalls made of light and dark stained wood, with lines and cut outs.  I had the Xoco margarita, which is pleasantly sour, slightly sweet, and refreshing, made with Cazadores Blanco, Citronage, fresh lime and cucumber, and homemade lime bitters. As a weary traveler, I opted for the red chile kale and topolobampo tortilla soup (sopa azteca). The kale was served in a tiny iron skillet, and the rich, mildly spicy guajillo sauce, onions, and potatoes complemented the kale very well. The sopa was incredible: a soothing dark chicken broth, avocado, thin strips of tortilla, cream, chicken (sustainably raised), and rich, handmade Jack cheese. It had the perfect balance of heartiness and spice. The side of tortillas were fresh and soft, but definitely not among the best I've had. I thought the portions were fair for the price, similar to what you would pay at a sit-down restaurant in D.F.

I would say this is one of the best restaurant meals I have ever had We shared the Sopes Rancheros for an appetizer and both agreed they were so good we would order them for an entrée.  My wife had a marinated rib steak, the Oaxacan style carne asada, with plantains and guacamole and it was delicious. I had the flank steak marinated in Serrano, (carne asada brava)., with grilled knob onions & sweet corn tamales.  It had a salsa on top that was incredible.  Both steaks we ordered were cooked perfectly.  Often at Mexican restaurants, the sauces are similar from one dish to another. Not here.

2014-10-07,2.0,"My family and I went to Frontera a couple of weeks ago for my brother's birthday. We made a reservation about 1.5 months out for a Friday night at 9, because that was the earliest available. We arrived at Frontera at about 8:45, just in case our table was ready a little earlier, but if not we were happy to wait at the bar and have a drink. Unfortunately, this is where the problems begin. As soon as we walked in and told them our name, the people at the hostess stand were very confused about our reservation, this was strange to us because they texted my brother a reservation confirmation the day before AND he called to confirm. We thought fine, we will just wait at the bar for our table to be ready at 9 as originally planned. Well, 9 rolls around and we inquire about our table, which they say is not ready yet. Ok, I get it stuff happens, we will wait a few more minutes. Well finally, they tell us our table is ready at 9:15, but in the bar area, which is clearly not where they seat groups this big. Also, before they set up our table, there wasn't a group bigger than a two top seated there. We tell them, we didn't make a reservation 1.5 months ago to be sat at a makeshift table in the bar area. Also, throughout this conversation, the people at the hostess stand had been extremely rude and NOT helpful or understanding, even though we had done nothing wrong. One of them actually said ""I am sorry you feel that way,"" like how else are you supposed to feel, when you make a reservation for your birthday dinner at a supposed nice restaurant and then get the run around from some nincompoops at the hostess stand. I worked in the restaurant business for about 10 years and I completely understand when stuff comes up behind the scenes that is out of your control, BUT working in this business it becomes your job to make sure the customer doesn't know about those problems and it doesn't affect their experience. If that means, comping their drinks while they wait or bringing out a free appetizer, it's a small price for the house to pay to keep the customer happy. Finally, at 9:35 we were sat at a table in the dining room. At this point, things finally started going well. Our waiter was very nice and helpful and the food was great. Don't worry we definitely tipped him 20% because what happened was far from his fault. Unfortunately, the whole experience with the host and hostesses left us with a very bad experience at Frontera, which is supposed to be a very high caliber restaurant. My advice to them would be to hire some people who are not rude jerks and have actual trouble shooting skills, so this doesn't happen again, as I've read in a few other reviews.",0.8702,0.78,0.12,0.1,0.5974143518518519

I wasnt.  It was of course not bad, but there was nothing that elevated it to the next level.  Maybe it was because we were stuck with the brunch menu and not the full dinner menu but to me it was no different then my local Mexican restaurant. One severe downside is that the room is TINY and you are sitting in a room no bigger than most peoples basement with 80+ people in close quarters.  Its hard to manuever, is not intimate and VERY loud.   The other downside is a $50 check and $22 parking.  $72 with no alcohol.  For that money we could have gone to a local place and had 2-3 margaritas a piece.",-0.9453,0.853,0.022,0.125,0.42864583333333334

Matt J. and I had a $100 gift card to use here, and for dinner for two with a margarita or two each, that almost covered all of it, which is a decent deal for a) how great the food was and b) how strong those margaritas were! Obviously this is a Rick Bayless restaurant so it has to be up to a certain level on yumminess. It is trendy, modern mexican food and everyone raves about his mole sauces, so of course we got some, and the rumors are true. We got the duck in yellow mole to be exact, and it wasn't as rich and thick of a mole as I was used to from Mexican restaurants back home in California, but it was pretty tasty. Definitely a unique approach to mole sauces which I love. Plus, pairing that with one of their ""snacks"" the shishito peppers was a nice combo too. But the star of the show for us was his ceviche. Wow was that ceviche amazing. We go the trio of ceviche so we could try it all and I would go back just for the Ceviche alone (although they didn't give us enough chips at first at all for it!). There was an albacore tomatoe ceviche, a shrimp and squid ceviche, and a tuna and avocado and tomatillo one, with that one being my favorite since I am semi obsessed with anything with avocado in it. It came out in a nice little trio presentation, and was a great way to start our meal, although it definitely was a lot of food even with the $19 price tag.  And that's what I liked about this place--you get nicer food, in a great colorful environment and it really isn't that expensive for being a trendy Chicago eating spot. The service was a little slow though, so not sure if coming on a weeknight which led to our ease in getting a table is because there are fewer people working on those nights and the rest of Chicago knows that?

Get in line early or try to score a reservation; otherwise, you could end up waiting for hours . But it would give you a chance to sample the delicious margaritas at the bar... I was recently in Chicago for business, but would only be around a few days. I started researching places to eat for dinner, and Rick Bayless' Frontera Grill came up as THE River North hot spot. I wasn't able to get a reservation (which are very limited), but I convinced my work colleagues to get to the restaurant about 15 minutes before opening on a Tuesday. We made it in to Frontera in the first group, but still had a 30 minute wait for a table.  The wait ended up being for the best though, since we got a chance to sample the delicious and fresh margaritas at the bar. I'm not usually a tequila fan, but these drinks were thoughtful and took full advantage of the Mexican flavors. Not overly sweet or tart, just fantastic.  As for the food, it was delicious as expected. The guacamole didn't knock my socks off but there certainly wasn't any left in the bowl after a few minutes. The savory-sesame chocolate tamales were unusual and delicious--the chocolate wasn't overly sweet and it just made a fantastic flavor combination. My colleague raved about the Tuesday goat special (the meat was very tender and savory), and my sirloin steak tacos had the perfect amount of spice and flavor.

After 30 minutes, the manager suggests we might want to wait in the bar.  I asked how much longer until our table was ready, and he says that he can't really say but they will come get us in the bar.   After 2 drinks and an appetizer in the bar, I check again with the hostess at 10:20 and was told my table had been ready at 9:20, and they had texted my cell phone and called me. They had never said that was how they would contact us, and I did not even bring my cell phone to the restaurant!

2014-09-01,5.0,"The menu at Frontera Grill changes regularly so I don't know if the things I'm writing about stay on the menu but I'm sure everything is delicious and creative. We ordered an appetizer of chips and salsa, which featured freshly-made tortilla chips and two different kinds of salsa. The red was a three chile salsa and the green was a tomatillo salsa with serrano and cilantro. The green salsa had a mild spice and a great fresh flavor from the cilantro. For my entree, I chose the Mole Trio and, based on our waiter's recommendation, a side of Modern Black Beans. The Mole Trio included two mole poblano enchiladas, lamb in Oaxacan black mole, and roasted vegetables in a yellow mole. It was also accompanied by a dish of fresh corn tortillas. The Modern Black Beans was a dish of black beans cooked in olive oil and roasted garlic that was topped with crispy onions, queso anejo, and cilantro.   Everything was plated beautifully and looked incredibly appetizing. My first bite was of the lamb in the Oaxacan black mole. OOOOOOOO. M. G. We have a winner for Best Thing I Ever Ate: Mexican. Game. Over. There was a depth of flavor in this dish that I have a difficult time putting into words. There were meaty elements from the tender lamb and smoky, sweet spices I'd never tasted in Mexican food before. I don't know if there was any dark chocolate but it almost reminded me of a rich, dark stew with notes of cocoa. I hesitate to even guess at any of the ingredients and spices because I don't want to get it wrong and misrepresent the chef. This Oaxacan black mole offered a rich and home-y flavor that had me feeling like I was enjoying a dish of Mexican comfort food, if there is such a thing. And scooping some on a fresh corn tortilla was heavenly. I used my finger to make sure I got every bit of the mole out of the small skillet it was served in. I'm not joking and I don't even care if you're judging me right now. Not even a little bit. The mole poblano enchiladas and roasted vegetables in yellow mole were different but also very good. Not black mole good (I'm not sure it's possible), but still really good. And as the waiter suggested, the Modern Black Beans were an excellent side for the mole trio. The beans were hearty and the crunch of the onions with the soft cheese was delicious. It also served as a nice dip for our tortilla chips. You could taste such an amazing difference between everything at Frontera Grill and the food you'd find at most Mexican restaurants. There's a level of sophistication to it that elevates Mexican cuisine to a level that's on par with any other type of food in the world. The total bill was around $75 for the two of us, which is an expensive lunch, but still well worth it. It was the best Mexican food I've ever had and it ranks right up there with any cuisine.

I come to Chicago twice a year and always come here and I usually love the food. This time it was a very different experience. I called them up ahead of time and asked for the wait time, they said wait time was 30 mins. Within 5 mins I arrived ad the rude wait staff said the wait time is 1.5 hrs, I asked how can a wait time change so fast and they had no answers. They finally gave me a table, I ordered Enchiladas from Kids menu, after having them my daughter complained it was hot, I tried it and found there were Jalapenos in my kids food, I brought it to the notice of the server who inspite of seeing whole jalapenos said that they weren't jalapenos and that their chef knew what they were doing, I called the manager immediately and he came and changed the dish, I ordered shrimp which was good, my wife ordered mushrooms which came wrapped in butter paper,  and this was recommended by our server, the dish was below average and my wife just couldn't enjoy it, we decided not to say anything, since we already reported my kids dish. Our server was rude and terrible, he made all the wrong recommendations, confronted jalapenos on my kids meal, never ever asked for water. I called the manager before paying the bill and told gave him my feedback, I also told him that this wouldn't really matter to them since they are always busy, but I was really disappointed. As I was coming out of the restaurant, I saw Mr. Bayless walk in, I really thought about stopping him and talking about my experience, but I decided not to, I didn't want to embarrass him or myself. I am not sure whether Mr. Bayless reads these reviews, but if he does, please take care of the rude wait staff, rude waiters and listen to your customers, I come from Minnesota and come here each time and wait patiently, I have no reason to give you a bad review, but this was a really bad experience, check with your manager and he will tell you the story.",-0.9763,0.834,0.051,0.115,0.6167592592592592

We went for a drink and pre dinner snack and back to check with the hostess and of course our table was not ready as yet. And Finally, we got seated around 9:00 pm. I would have just say forget it and eat somewhere else, but some one in our group really wanted to eat here. So does the food worth the crazy long wait? Not really.... Margarita was weak.. I was glad I stuck with my beer. We ordered quite a few items to share, with some hits and misses and some just meh. The grilled meat plate we ordered were overcooked and tasted bland. The cerviche was a little dried. The Mole was really good, love the complex taste profile. Definitely order the dessert, which is probably the best part of the meal.

We also ordered shishito peppers which was delivered with our meal.  It is listed as a side on the menu but I wish they would have come out as an appetizer as you can certainly nosh on them in this fashion.  I love shishito peppers.  I only had just tried them for the first time the night before at Mercat La Planxa and so was extremely excited to see them on the menu at Frontera.  I do have to say that although they were delicious, they were much bigger than the ones at Mercat and maybe because of this (?) they weren't as flavorful as Mercat. The drinks: the margarita, which wasn't outstanding but unique and strong, albeit small.  My second drink:  The Oaxacan, also unique, better than the margarita, also strong and also small.  Last but not least: Black sands: coconut cream, rum, vanilla, nutmeg, black sesame and a couple of other ingredients I'm sure I'm forgetting.  I wish I would have ordered this one first (FYI: its a seasonal cocktail) because if it would have been possible I would have ordered a pitcher!  Oh my god, it was like a Mexican Bushwhacker (if you've ever been to Pensacola...)!  Probably one of the best drinks I've ever had! The food: SMOKED MAHI ENCHILADAS, SQUASH BLOSSOM CREMA and DUCK in DATE MOLE.  I don't what to say except for, ""Are you freakin kidding me?!""  The fish was fresh, the crema was something I could drink, the duck was tender.

2014-08-02,4.0,"From recording his tv shows to owning several cookbooks and even salsas and marinades from Rick Bayless, yeah, you could say we are fans. Of course, it makes sense that the very first meal we have in Chicago would be lunch at his restaurant, Frontera Grill. Before the restaurant even opened at 11:30am for lunch, people were already lined up to enjoy their long awaited savory experience. To our surprise, it really didn't take long for us to get seated since we lined up early. Basil blackberry margarita made its first appearance. It was like that first kiss that you anticipate. Is it going to be sweet? Is it going to be salty? Too overdone? It perfectly met the taste buds with the fruity aroma from the blackberry and the basil evened out the flavor by assuring the sweetness would not be overdone. Definitely unique. Surely worth a try. The duck quesadillas. Growing up, my mom always prepared duck and although it was one of my favorite dishes, it was always a battle between cooking the meat enough so its not too chewy and still preventing it from being so well done that it becomes stringy and hard. This duck at Frontera was incredibly tender and flavorful with each bite. It was cradled in Mexican cheese and blanketed in cooked tortillas that were crispy but still thick. No need to worry about an oily mess, because the dish was so neatly put together. The Big Wood Grilled Taco Trio. Amazing. The skirt steak became an obsession for me and I could not stop eating it. Order it medium rare on the rarer side and you will not be disappointed. The tender juiciness combined with the spiciness screamed at your senses with each bite. The pork in its red al pastor type marinade (or sauce?) also had its own powerful flavor and it was not overshadowed by the skirt steak. The Gunthorp chicken was not as spicy as its other ""siblings"" on the platter but still was very tasty. However, the chicken, soft in texture, and seasoned well, met the taste buds with more politeness. My hubby enjoyed that Mole Trio. It was served on a longer platter with the traditional mole in the center. The center mole was classic and every bite seemed familiar and what you expect a mole to be! The vegetarian mole on one of the ends which was actually green surprisingly one of may favorites on his dish. I did not get a chance to eat the third mole because he finished it before I did. Ho-hum, I guess I'll just have to come back some other time and try it myself!! One extremely exciting and unexpected treat was we actually saw Rick Bayless. Only the girls sitting at a table adjacent to us noticed and their gasps gave the news away. He simply was rearranging some of the pictures (or awards?) in the hallway on the way to the restrooms, just matter of factly and casually went to another area of a restaurant. They wanted a picture so badly with him, that I was almost tempted to ask him for one with them, but my hubs beckoned me not to bother him. Next time, I'm not listening to the hubs, I'm going to say ""hi!""",0.9916,0.822,0.128,0.05,0.48771338724168933
2014-07-31,1.0,"Rick Bayless, you need to come down here and instill some quality control.  I'm afraid this place is resting on its laurels, and it is certainly not worth the effort or price to come here as it presently exists.  My story: I grew up near Chicago and wanted to impress my Californian wife with Chi-town culinary delights. I'd only had Bayless's food at ORD, but knew he was famous, trusted in the Yelp 4-star review, and made a reservation for lunch. They called to insist that I re-confirm it; I did.  We arrived a bit early and they were really nice and gave us a quiet-ish table in a noisy restaurant. It was downhill from there. The service: Total amateur hour. Took a long time to get menus and for them to take the order. Took a long time to get our appetizers. No one bothered to take our empty plates; I finally asked someone to take them, and the person took some of them but left some dirty plates. Why is this so hard? The waiter came and replaced our silverware for the next course. My wife noted that her new knife was dirty. The waiter had an extra, and gave her that. Cool. ...And then a few minutes later, he came back and replaced her clean one with another one. What? Did he see something on that last knife?  Mysterious and awkward....  More long wait for the main course.  People who came after us were eating their main courses by then. When our food arrived, we were surprised b/c my wife ordered the oysters/ceviche dish, but it only arrived with oysters. We assumed, when the oysters arrived with no ceviche, that the ceviche would come after the oysters. But it didn't--she next was served her tortilla chicken soup. So we said, excuse us, what happened to the ceviche? He said it doesnt come with ceviche. My wife asked to see the menu; he went and got one. We showed him. He then said we were right--but that he would talk to his manager. (Huh?) And then he came back and said he would bring the ceviche.    That finally came after her soup was finished.  So it was basically a ceviche dessert... We thought he would at least take my Diet Pepsi off our bill to compensate for this screw up.  Nope.  Full bill.  The food: my chicken taquitos were pretty good but were lukewarm at best. You know that feeling when you put some food to your lips and it immediately feels cold? it's not actually cold, but it's not nearly as warm as it should be.  the oysters were good with a tasty, flavorful sauce.  the carne asada quesadillas were OK. the meat was good, but there wasn't much of it, though, and the tortilla was incredibly plain, like something from a cafeteria.  wish i would have taken a picture.  the beans were barely warm. the tortilla soup had almost no chicken in it.  it was basically just broth and tortilla strips. we made jokes about being in a prisoner of war camp...   the ceviche--so long awaited--wasn't worth the wait.  the citrusy one was especially bad.  like raw fish and citrus in a blender.  Rick Bayless, please come back and fix this place!  It feels like it was filled with tourists who didn't know any better.  And sadly, that's what we were.",0.9546,0.797,0.114,0.089,0.5232896312441768

Someone stopped by and asked us if we wanted some chips while we waited, we declined but that was a nice gesture. Wife and I both got mole dishes. She got the duck, which was delicious. I got the mole three ways, which was also delicious. After a little bit though I had wished I ordered rice, but also wish this dish would have just come with a small portion.  One nitpick: I've never ordered rice ""a la carte"" from any other Mexican, Tex-Mex or southwestern  restaurant I've ever been to. To me, having it a la carte is like charging people for bread at an Italian restaurant. A bit weird, and takes away from the ""charm"" of the place. Overall, a great place to have lunch but if I returned I wouldn't wait 45 minutes to eat.

They messaged us three hours later, which is ridiculous to think we would wait that long. They even asked us to just walk around or wait outside. A few days later, I called to make another reservation the day before we went. The lady who answered me was perhaps THE most arrogant person I have ever spoken to. Zero inter-personal skills and customer service skills. I called the day of our reservation to make sure and the lady who answered this time asked us to show up a couple of hours before our reservation and put our name on the waiting list. Even though this is completely disorganized from the restaurant and the staff is misinforming customers of it's policies, we showed up to put our names on the waiting list. The arrogant girl who I spoke to on the phone was there and she was even ruder and more arrogant in person. Her name was Maria. Another older lady amongst the staff was there and also arrogant put our reservation on the waiting for 1.5 hrs and she was extremely full of herself for no reason and was very rude to my husband. Her name was Mosha. She told us they don't take reservations by phone, as such our reservation was apparently now non-existent. Which contradicts what her other rude colleague Maria told us. Then once again, we agreed to wait because my husband and I are on our honeymoon in the US and heard good reviews about this place. She then passed us on to Maria who then said we will have to wait 2 or more hours to sit. Lack of coordination again! My husband and I got upset and Maria sarcastically shrugged at us saying that she remembered us from a few days before and that we were on our ""honeymoon."" She obviously that we fabricated that information in an attempt to get a table or something. My husband went in to speak to the manager who was much more professional and polite. As for myself, I will never visit this restaurant again or recommend it to anyone. Above the food, customers return to restaurants for the service they receive. Maria and Mosha obviously never took any restaurant or service training. Honestly, I don't know why they hired them or why they still keep them.

2014-07-13,3.0,"Frontera Grill is the classic ""middle child"" of Rick Bayless' restaurants - overshadowed and overlooked.  The best item on the menu is from Topolobampo. First, we ordered guacamole. It was okay, but nothing to write home about. More importantly, we were served cold and stale chips. I initially thought that the chips were just bad, but then we were given more and the second batch were warm and not stale. I guess our first batch was old. We then shared the mole enchiladas. They had a great flavor but were also cold. I ended with the Topolobampo chicken tortilla soup. Finally something on the menu was flavorful and up to par with what I expect from a Bayless restaurant.  The restaurant is overlooked for two reasons: the ambience is uncomfortable and rushed, and the experience has an overall lower quality than either Xoco or Topolobampo. First, the ambience is so odd. The room is crowded and so loud that it's hard to hear anyone. Also, I have to admit that the experience is really undermined by the fact that you are sitting next door to two of the best restaurants in Chicago. (That's right, Topolobampo and Xoco are amazing. I highly recommend checking them out.) This brings me to my next point. If you've been to either Xoco or Topolobampo, then you've come to expect great things from Bayless (and justifiably so). Both of his other restaurants are all around wonderful. Unfortunately, Frontera just doesn't offer the same quality experience.

We met the utterly enchanting manager, Kyle who was kind enough to spend time at our table and tell us about their most recent Mexico trip. He is wonderful!  Our server, Diego was also great! Awesome recommendations and he handled a crazy situation with grace (the people at the table next to us came there and only had 20 minutes for dinner. Who does that at Frontera?).

We liked the Guacamole, so we ordered seconds.  We asked for more chips but the waiter commented that we'd have to buy them, which we declined.  Considering the cost of the meal, skimping on chips is ridiculous. Then I had the CHICKEN in MOLE AMARILLO, which I found to be pretty unimpressive.  Not spicy or sweat, just a tomato based sauce with chicken and vegetables.  It came with a salad and some tortilla's to make taco's.  I think I made a few and then offered it to others as I was unimpressed. My wife had enchiladas and beans, which seemed better, and my daughter had taquito's, which were pretty good.  I just got the dud on the menu. Drink prices for these place are horrendous, I think we had 3 drinks for $35 dollars.  I've never seen that before.  Rip off.

On to the sub-par service.  Our server acted as though she had somewhere better to be, and that we were an inconvenience to her.  I don't need to be fawned over, but when she went to the table next to us 3 times before greeting us, I was starting to wonder why we even bothered.  My boyfriend actually had to ask for a food menu from a bus boy since our server failed to bring us one. Next, the bland food.  Rick Bayless should be ashamed to have his name attached to such boring, tasteless cuisine!  The guacamole we ordered tasted store bought - like something that would come in a big plastic container that you would have to mix with salsa to add flavor.  Eck!  I bet the Frontera pre-made guac-mix sold in-store is better!  Not to mention that it took waaaaaay too long to get to our table. As for the entrees, my boyfriend ordered the charcoaled chicken quesadilla.  Although the chicken was moist, the cheese inside was a slice that had been melted as opposed to shreds, the tortilla was unusually thick for a quesadilla, and it had no salsa or spice to make it taste interesting.  He described it as bland, underwhelming, and lacking of any flavor. I ordered the spring greens enchiladas ""suizas"".  Although not the absolute worst enchiladas I have ever had, they, too, were extremely underwhelming.  I've probably had more flavorful food from food at Sharkey's or Baja Fresh.  That's right - chain restaurants have more flavor than Frontera Grill. In addition, I had really been looking forward to the huevos rancheros which was listed on the menu for that period of time.  Unfortunately for me, that item is not made on week days.  Would have been nice if that had actually been listed on the menu.... Although it may seem that I am one of those people that needs to have my food slathered in salt, spice, and sauce to taste good to me - think again.  I have been to many high-end Mexican and latin restaurants and have never had such disappointing food.

2014-05-24,1.0,"Quite Disappointing! My wife and I are huge Rick Bayless fans. Well we're fans of his TV show, his books, and his cooking philosophy.  However, his restaurant was very disappointing on our last visit. We've visited Frontera twice, once 5 years ago back when Rick was still cooking at the the restaurant and again last week during the National Restaurant Association Show in Chicago. I'm not sure if Rick still cooks at the restaurant or not, but we were not impressed. Here's a summary of our experience: RESERVATION: We had a reservation for a party of 10 people that we had confirmed weeks ago for dinner. We arrived to the restaurant 30 mins early know that it's a busy place, but we wanted to make sure that our table would be ready on time. It wasn't!  Although we had a reservation we had to over an hour for our table.  I felt as though we were being treated as an inconvenient ""walk-in' group, not a group that had booked and confirmed our reservation ahead of time. AMBIANCE: Love the art work and the colors, but this is one of the loudest restaurants that I have ever been to. It's virtually impossible to have a conversation with people in your group without yelling.  Rick, if you read this, you need to invest in hiring an acoustic treatment specialist to assess your restaurant and provide you with options to reduce the sound. It will make it a much more pleasant experience for your customers and your staff.  Besides, exposing your employees and yourself to loud decibels on a daily basis is a work safety hazard.  FOOD: Well, 5 years ago the food was OK. This year, it was a mostly thumbs down. The guacamole, chips and salsa were great, but over priced. $10 for a scoop of guac. is pretty steep. Since it took the restaurant over an hour, they comp'd our guacamole. The tortilla soup was good, but too salty and the rest of the food was pretty, but frankly speaking shouldn't be called Mexican. Nor was is good.  The mole enchiladas were dry, the steaks were not cooked as ordered. They were either over-cooked or under-cooked. No one really enjoyed the food. Coming from Los Angeles with a group that is part American-Mexican, we expected to get great Mexican food at Rick's restaurant.  Rick's recipes and his packaged supermarket products are usually great, but the stuff they served at his restaurant were ....... let's just say there's a lot of work that needs to be done.   SERVICE: A part from the reservation and check-in experience, the service was pretty good. I truly wish I had a better review for Mr. Bayless. He seems to be a genuinely nice man and I wish that others have a much better experience than we did. I once wrote to him 5 years ago about a negative experience at his restaurant and I was surprised that he personally wrote back to apologize.",0.998,0.766,0.189,0.045,0.5962318840579711

Walked right in with no line and watch straight to the hostess she told me there was a 40 minute wait for a table and that if I did not want to wait I can go eat at the bar.. Ordered a margarita which was extremely small for the price of $11.50.. Service was some of the worst I have ever seen very spotty I asked the waiter/bartender for margarita and also an order of the guacamole he did not return with my guacamole or margarita for 15 minutes and if that time there's only four people sitting at the bar, after giving me my margarita and guacamole he did not give me any napkin nor Silverware I had to ask for every single one. I even wanted to put in order for the smoky chicken tuquitos and the bartender did not return back to the other end of the bar for at least 10 minutes. Once I put in my order it took roughly around 20 minutes to get my appetizer. I've been wanted to put in my order for my main dinner which then also the bartender disappeared again for a second time it he did not come back to the other end of the bar for close to 15 minutes.. No I don't mind if you're busy trying to get orders for customers but he was standing at the other end of the bar chatting with other coworkers When he finally did make his way to my side of the bar the place was becoming ridiculously packed almost to the point of being sardined against people at the bar. I put in an order for their taco special which was a wood roasted chicken pork and steak dish. When it arrived to me my order it was massive much larger than I thought it would be I thought...flavor was some of the best Mexican food I've ever had... by this time though since the waiter took so long to take my order and also to deliver my food I was almost out of time for my meeting I had to wrap up my food and asked if I could have it put in a to go container he took another 20 minutes to do this and by that time I was almost running late when I got home to look at the container with my food it was thrown in A box all mashed together in a horrible way... If you're going to spend close to $100 on Mexican food the service should be spot on and when you asked for to go container it should not be in a cardboard box which looks the garbage when you get home this gets three stars for the food being fantastic but the service being some of the worst I've experienced in Chicago!!!

2014-05-22,5.0,"Essential. Revisionist Mexican by The Master, Rick Bayless. $8.50 Starter CHICKEN IN BLACK BEAN SAUCE is tangy to the point that you don't lick it, you feel it licking you... licking the roof of your mouth. Now, the $20+ plates: SHRIMP in RED CHILI PIPIAN has me mentally concentrated with every spicy, savory bite. I've never been a sauce-hound, but I scooped up every last drop of sauce into as many shrimp and black rice and green bean and fried onion bites as I could. PORK IN BANANA LEAVES is fat succulent meat, so much to stuff your face with. If you want to slow down, put that pork in a taco -- use your bite molars and tongue on this one. Dessert: FLAN that hits you like ecstasy. Excuse my hyperbole, but it's the best flan I've ever had -- the powdered almonds on the chocolate flan makes it special and brings a hard & soft diversity in each bite. Eggy-soft yet firm gelatin, lushness and moistness... sublime flan, I kid you not. Now I had one disappointment. And it would be one of the biggest thrills of my life if a restaurant manager contacted me and considered my suggestion. I had the CHAMPAGNE MARGARITA, I don't doubt any of the said ingredients or added orange liqueur. But upon served it loses its' chill very fast, and I think this drink would be stupendous if served super-chilled. Earnestly, I think ""Frontera"" should serve their cocktails in frosted glasses. Yes, I repeat, frosted glasses. But don't let that keep you away from one of the great class act restaurants this side of Lake Michigan. Any out-of-towners should place this at the top of your must-do list.

We also got the Frontera guacamole for an appetizer. Definitely one of the best guacs I've ever had and I'm pretty picky about my guacamole.

I have to say New Rebozo is 10 times better than the other two. Frontera Grill is only an average restaurant overall. The flavor was not good at all, it ruined the good quality meat.

Average food would ordinarily rate 3 stars, but the prices charged here are outrageous in comparison to the quality.   I've been here a few times and always thought that maybe I ordered the wrong things. After my most recent experience, I can safely conclude that the food is just not that good. The sweet plantains are actually great, but I wouldn't recommend a restaurant based on a single side dish. The best of the rest is the ceviche, which I rate only as above average.  The room is dark and dated. We were most recently there on a warm, sunny day and the dining room was like entering a cave. It was actually a downer as we came inside from one of the first nice days of spring. Service was unpolished. Everyone at the table was delivered the wrong food, waiter took food order without asking about drinks, etc. There is usually a long wait to get into Frontera, so I think many people have a sense of accomplishment getting to eat here. I feel like that, coupled with Bayless' renown, are what make people rate Frontera higher than it should be rated.

I went to Frontera and stood in line on a Wednesday night before they opened at 5:20pm, and it was quite exciting, like I was waiting in line for a concert. Oh, the anticipation! The people in the line were all excited, anxious and asking questions, like ""Have you ever been here before?"" ""They open at 5:20, right?"". Then when they opened the door, everyone in line was seated really quickly. The restaurant was full in about 20 minutes. I've never seen anything like it. They have this system down to a science.  The food & margaritas are all very good. Anything you get will be good. There are several varieties of margaritas - I had the Meyer Lemon (the seasonal special) and the Classic - I think that I preferred the Meyer Lemon but both were good. The smoked chicken taquitos (appetizer) were the best thing I've eaten in a long time. I could have probably ordered 3 orders of those and had them as my dinner. After I tasted it, I stopped my friend in mid-sentence to talk about how amazing they were. You CAN'T miss the smoked chicken taquitos. I also tried the Plantain Tlacoyos (corn masa ovals with plantains and black beans), which were very tasty. The Oxacan-style Carne Asada was truly outstanding. I don't eat steak very often, but this steak was so flavorful - it had a smoky flavor to it, and I enjoyed every bite. I would definitely get it again.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that the service was not what I was expecting from a Rick Bayless establishment. The server was great at first, but then he disappeared for a good 20 minutes. When my friend very nicely asked what happened, the server shrugged it off and sort of got a little bit of an attitude.

Apparently my coworkers had to make reservations 2 weeks in advance to get a table for 4 at 9:30.  Insane!  It's that Rick Bayless effect I guess.  We actually showed up at 6:30, thinking we could always drink for a bit before getting our table.  We had some margaritas; I had the mezcal varities - the paloma is the best one!  The others are only average.  And the fact that I can say I had 3 margaritas over the meal and didn't get a buzz should tell you they did not serve Texas-strength margs.  For shame! They were able to seat us early, which was so nice!  Overall, the service we experienced is just like what others were saying - slow to visit and take orders, slow to refill drinks especially water, slow to take orders. So, the food:  Sorry folks, that guac you're raving over is not that great.  Sure, it's fresh, but the avocado did the work, not the chef.  The chips were corn chips and decent, but I don't think they were homemade.  Are we keeping score against Texas?  Right now Chicago is 0 for 3.  Don't worry, that's about to change. We kicked it off with the ceviche and oyster platter, and the stuffed jalapenos.  Both were good, but the stuffed jalapenos were better.  The oysters were certainly fresh but a little small. I had the Oaxacan style carne asada for dinner.  Oh. Dios.  MIO.  I asked for it rare and it was so deliciously, tenderly, perfectly-seasoned rare that I think I heard the gates of Heaven open to the sound of mariachi.  It was fan-friggin-tastic.  It came with a side of black beans (delicious and prepared in the traditional fashion, yum) a side of guac (we've talked about this), and fried plantains.  I almost died joining the clean plate club but I DID IT.  The plantains were particularly perfect. And now you're wondering, why is she still writing?  Could it be...after all that food...that we went for DESSERT?!  HELL YEAH!  I had the homemade vanilla ice cream with the chocolate sauce AND the caramel sauce.  You gotta get both because they complement each other so good.  If you're gonna be lame and just get one, make it the caramel sauce, which is homemade cajeta.

Frontera Grill demonstrates that you can achieve those bold flavors while still maintaining the integrity your ingredients. My pork in manchamanteles was so balanced, I could taste every component: from the mole, to the sweet pineapple, to the earthy purple potato. Yet they all married together beautifully. I'm also not sure I've ever had a better tasting tortilla chip - these are thick, crunchy, and ultimately satisfying. A couple minor issues keep this from being a 5 star review. Several items seemed heavy handed on the salt. The chips, salsas, and the arugula in my dish were quite salty and I felt this detracted from their already-wonderful flavors. Also, a friend and I ordered the same dish and a basket of soft tacos was brought out for the both of us, but there were only 5. When you're enjoying a meal as good as this one, you don't want to have to deal with the awkwardness of deciding who gets the last taco. I really enjoyed the ambience here.

We of course got guacamole - more onion and garlic powdery, light on cilantro and tomato, but DELICIOUS. creamy avocados and quite a bit for $10 (or maybe just because everything is cheaper in Chicago than LA). I also got corn masa in green peanut mole with vegetables. Can i just have this ALL THE TIME? My friend got chicken enchilada mole (which I tried the sauce) and we both loved the sauce and she loved the enchiladas. I also had made a reservation about 2 months ahead of time (at least) and had NO problems. The manager also came up since i said I was a vegetarian coming from CA and allergic to mangoes and explained all things that had mango in it and any ingredients that had meat (FYI the black beans do!! so you have to ask w/o).

2014-03-15,3.0,We visited the restaurant a few days ago and were pleasantly surprised. Being a vegetarian I was a little worried they wouldn't have anything for me but I was wrong! I had the Spicy Chipotle Mushrooms with corn tortillas and black beans. The entire meal was flavorful. My daughter (2 yrs) had a quesadilla with rice. The rice was prepared simple but was still great. The overall experience was rated as 3 stars because the servers that day were not very attentive. It took the server a while to get our drink order and a while to return with said drinks. It was not easy to get his attention when we needed small things like extra silverware.  This place is more suited for adults and not children. If I returned again I would leave our child with a sitter.,0.721,0.824,0.106,0.07,0.5065083725798011
2014-03-07,3.0,"I'll begin by saying that I've been following Rick's cooking shows for many years, perhaps a decade.  I have always wanted to eat at one of his restaurants and was finally awarded the opportunity this week.   First thing is first.  Customer service was phenomenal.  My girlfriend and I were served by Pancho and he was excellent.  The same goes for the manager.  Service was 5 stars no doubt. Restaurant decor was on the cheesy side.  Unimaginative and trite. As for the food, it was mediocre.  I really wanted to have a mind blowing gastronomical experience and I was expecting to taste Rick's passion for Mexican cuisine translated into deliciousness in my mouth.  It did not happen...not for me nor for my girlfriend.  We had Trout al Cilantro and Oaxacan style carne asada.  Without going into excruciating detail about the dishes, I'm just going to sum up the experience as lackluster and not memorable by any capacity.  Our margaritas (blood orange) were good but nothing to brag about. Having dined extensively throughout Mexico, I have eaten much better food for 1/4th the cost (or less).  Perhaps it's time for Rick Bayless to revisit his menu at Frontera Grill and make the dishes live up to his claim to fame...or at least make the dishes live up to their price.",0.8126,0.896,0.071,0.033,0.4995833333333334

People are packed in like sardines and we had to practically yell at each other over the roar of the crowd.  Our waiter came by after about a minute and asked for our drink order. We said we needed a minute to look over the menu. He left and didn't return for ten to fifteen minutes. By then, we knew what we wanted for drinks, appetizer and entree. When he got the drink order, he was in such a rush that he left while I was trying to tell him we were ready to put in the entire order.  Regarding the food: the bacon guacamole was good. The scallop ceviche was a joke; we paid about $15 for a medium sized scallop sliced up into 6 pieces drizzled with some lime. The entrees were cooked as requested and were very tasty. Homemade tortillas were nice. The blood orange margarita I ordered was fine, but it was the smallest drink I've ever had. Four tablespoons does not a margarita make. My main issue is that it is not a good value. It certainly was not exceptional food. It was good food. I don't think it warrants the price tag.",0.9392,0.896,0.093,0.011,0.5202380952380952
2014-02-27,5.0,"Out of all of the iron chef restaurants that I have eaten at including Morimoto, Butter, Mesa Grill, and Babbo, this has to be my favorite! We walked in on a Tuesday night around 7:30pm with no reservations. Although the wait was longer than expected, about an hour which was longer than the 45 minutes that they had told us, the food was well worth the wait! My friend and I started off with their cocktails, ordering a Topolo Margarita and a Blood Orange Margarita. Both were great, extremely tasty...and a great way to cleanse our palate before eating dinner. For dinner, we ordered the Mole Trio and the Oaxacan-Style Carne Asada.  - Mole Trio: I really enjoyed the poblano enchilada out of the trio. It was my first time eating Mole, boy do I love it. It was everything I had heard about, full of complex and deep flavor and after eating that dish I can see how complex Mexican flavors can be. Out of the trio, my least favorite was the roasted veggies in green peanut mole. Overall, next time I would probably try another dish. - Carne Asada: Steak was OUT OF THIS WORLD good. My steak was cooked perfectly medium. Making tacos with the steak, beans, plantains, and guacamole was like having heaven in my mouth. My only complaint was that I wished that they included a side of rice, which I chose to order on the side. For any first timers to this restaurant, I definitely definitely recommend ordering this dish! For dessert, my friend and I shared the chocolate cocounut cake. I have to say that this dessert added the cherry on top for this perfect dinner. I don't know what it was, but the combination of sweet, salty, warm, and cold was absolutely perfect. This must of been one of the best desserts I have ever had. Overall, Frontera Grill had amazing food whose hype didn't let me down.

Ok, since Richard Dawkins isn't here to help, I will give you the answers: SURVEY SAYS: 1) Oysters 2) Ribs That's right. Everyone else can rave about things like margaritas (I had way more than ""several"") and mole (of course it's good, what a silly question) and guacamole (sooooo fresh) but I am here to talk about oysters and ribs. But first- the six of us got there and there was a 2 1/2 hour wait. That's ok, we went to the bar, we found 4 chairs, 4 of us sat, 2 of us stood, and soon a nearby couple left and then voila, we all had a seat. And it took all of 30 minutes. So don't fret. We ordered the guacamole. Of course it is good. Again, what a silly question. We ordered oysters. Yup. Oysters. If you like oysters, then get these. It is such a nice change from the usual horseradish and cocktail sauce. These come with a tomatillo-habanero sauce and when was the last time you had that with your oysters? It is not too spicy, but it is flavorful and really terrific with the oysters. And, if you think it is toooooo spicy, just order another margarita or two. One way or another, you'll be fine. Ribs: Did you know ""costillas"" in Spanish also means ""girlfriend""? Neither did I, but now I do and now I have a new girlfriend. These are slathered in Chipotle and they are spicy. Yup, for sure you'll need two or three margaritas with these. They are unbelievably good and are the Saturday special. So, if you are here on a Saturday, have at least one person in the group get these. You won't be disappointed. Lastly: Get the Shrimp in Chilpachole. Spicy, smokey, and perfect with a margarita (notice a pattern here?). You already know you have to come to Frontera. And you know you have to try all the usuals...but now you know to also get the oysters and ribs.

The service was quick and polite; we were seated at a corner table/booth (my favorite); and I enjoyed the lively atmosphere inside. Most importantly, the food was AMAZING! Sopes rancheros: My favorite dish of the meal, an awesome starter. The beef was tender and so well seasoned; combined with the avocado and cheese they were perfect! Spicy bacon: A subtle, smoky spiciness that grew on me with each bite. CHOMP. Catfish tacos: Really liked the tortillas, very soft and almost doughy in texture. The grilled onions (ordered separately) complemented the fish well as did the more citrus-y salsa. Comes with some guac and beans. Chilaquiles verdes: Great combination of flavors, I loved the cheese. And of course, the hot chocolate- not sweet in that artificial, too sugary way, but a real deep sweetness with just the right amount of cinnamon.  I would definitely recommend Frontera Grill for a fun, unique interpretation of classic Mexican dishes. Everything was beautifully presented and the ingredients were so fresh and came together so well. My Mexican boyfriend found no faults with our meal, and although we could never replace our regular hole-in-the-wall Mexican spots with Frontera, it is definitely worth the splurge for a nice occasion!",0.995,0.717,0.25,0.032,0.6095515436944009
2014-02-23,4.0,"What else can be said about Rick Bayless' restaurants except we continue to be lured back again and again to the best Mexican in town.   We've been to Topolo and Frontera a few times but more recently only to Frontera as it is a little more ""cost friendly"".  I will of course never forget our last time at Topolo years ago when President Obama decided to drop by for dinner.  Yes, it was the awestruck OMIGOSH moment for sure. Just the guacamole and topolo margarita's are sufficient to bring me back to Frontera.  The margarita's go down smooth and aren't exactly cheap at $11 each.  Beware as your drink bill can easily exceed your food bill. There's a wide array of appetizers to try but our favorites down-pat have been the Old School Frontera Trio and the Street Food Trio.  One of these is plenty for a party of two.  Get ready to indulge your taste-buds in chicken taquitos, cheese quesadillas, molotes, sopes and oh....more guacamole.  Even my non-fish eating husband ate the melt-in-your mouth ceviche tostadas without complaint    During our last visit we also decided to share the tortilla soup; definitely one of the best we've had.  Soup is not what comes to mind at a Mexican restaurant but this dark broth with chicken, avocado, cheese & crispy tortilla strips is just delicious. By the way, the salsas that come with the guacamole and appetizers are good enough to drink.  We make sure we scrape the little bowls clean. While the appetizers have been consistently divine; the main courses have been great or just ok.   A few months ago, our main courses included chile-rubbed chicken in divine coloradito mole and a fabulous day-boat catch accompanied by beets, grilled squash, pickled red onions, and mashed potatoes.  We left thinking..........oh that was heaven. Our last visit included the oaxacan-style black angus rib steak for my husband and I had the mole trio.  Both were good but we were nowhere near blown away.  The steak is quite fatty and neither one of us acquired a taste for the sweet plantains.  The trio was enchiladas in poblano sauce, pork and beans in coloradito, and vegetables in green mole.  I didn't care for the green mole although the enchiladas were nice. A parting thought.  Among other things, you can buy frontera all natural guacamole mix at most local grocery stores.  If you think you can mimic Frontera Grill's amazing guacamole with this.............not even remotely close.  The woman at the table by us overheard me talking about this and we shared a quick chuckle.  I will not be buying this mix again.

2014-02-04,4.0,"While passing by the mass of people lining up to get into Frontera Grill on a regular basis, I would laugh at the suckers waiting to get in. But secretly, I was curious and a bit jealous. What would drive these normally sane people to stand and wait to eat Mexican food for hours? This question immediately popped in my head when we stopped by after 10pm on a Friday night to check the wait time. I was not very hungry, but when the hostess told us ""35 minutes,"" I couldn't say no. Dinner service stops at 11pm, but I never felt rushed in the service we received (service was excellent), even being seated past 10:30pm. I looked over the menu, but was immediately conflicted, I wanted EVERYTHING. After deliberation with the group, here is what was decided on.   Ceviche Trio (Frontera/Tropical Tuna/Yucatecan) - all three of the samplers were delicious. My favorite was the Tropical Tuna, which was more like a guacamole with tuna rather than a traditional ceviche. The other two were more like traditional ceviche and were both delicious (but harder to distinguish between). If you don't know which ceviche to choose, definitely get this sampler.  Street Trio (Potosinas/Molotes/Sopes) - I was a bit indifferent on the two meat offerings. But the fried cheese (potosinas) were really a stand out. They were delicious. The molotes and sopes were OK, but I didn't find them game changing.  Tortilla Soup - this was flat out delicious. The avocado, the tortilla strips, the cheese, down to the hot broth. We nearly licked the bowl clean.  Duck Breast with Tamarind & Ancho - The duck breast was tender and not overly seasoned. It was great complimented with the crispy tamarind and mole sauce the surrounded it. Very good.  Friday Special (Suadero) - This was a 20 hour cooked brisket, that melted as soon as it jumped in my mouth. The dark mole sauce was great and it was flavorful, but not overpowering to the point where I couldn't eat it by itself. Definitely good.  Mushroom Cazuela - this corn, mushrooms, and spices mixture was delicious. A little small, but it really was a great addition to everything else we ate.  Green Beans - just normal garlic green beans, but they were prepared well and fit in well to provide a break from all the heavy flavors.  Duo de Flanes - I don't really remember much of this dish. I think it was a bit overshadowed by the tres leches, but I think it was still a good offering.  Tres Leches - I really enjoyed this dessert (even though we didn't finish it). It has pomegranate seeds on top with a berry filling with whipped cream all around. It was not too sweet, and let the fruit taste really come through. Very enjoyable experience.  One thing I really didn't enjoy was the tortilla. I think it really didn't provide much for me and came out a bit cold. I tried one with the mole and ended up tossing the rest.  Frontera Grill really hit the spot for me. It lived up to its hype and made me into a fan. The food selection was exciting, even if not all the items were spectacular. The food is flavorful but not overpowering while having great textures and presentation. I will definitely come again (hopefully not to a long wait).",0.999,0.763,0.211,0.027,0.5348066748066747

I'd been to Topolobampo, the attached higher end restaurant, before, but I'd always wanted to see if the main restaurant could live up to the hype. And it most certainly did. Let me just start off by saying that my expectations were high since I just spent a week in the Yucatan region and had dined on some of the best Mexican food I've had in my life. But Bayless's reputation as someone who strives to incorporate real regional flavors and recipes in his dishes remains intact with me. I thought the food was really excellent, if not quite as inventive as Topolobampo or as exquisitely delicious as the authentic dishes we had in Mexico. The mole enchiladas I tried were the second best mole dish I've ever had (second to the Red Iguana in Salt Lake City). The guacamole was excellent. The garlic shrimp my wife ordered were super yummy. I highly recommend them to anyone who is trying Frontera for the first time.  The black bean side dish is something I will order again.

It came with a raw tuna marinated in a fruit salsa (which was my favorite of the two) and another with albacore, limes, tomatoes, and olives Carne Asada - Rib steak, bean, sweet plantain, a little bit of guac, covered with their own creme sauce which added a great cheese like flavor to the dish.

I arrived at the restaurant at 4 30 PM on a Thursday and was seated immediately. We ordered the cerviche and oyster combo, table side guacamole, and 3 samplings of the mole. 1. Oyster/Cerviche combo- Please keep a note and make sure you order the British Columbia oysters. They were some of the best oysters that I ever ate. Extremely meaty, creamy, and fresh. I always order east coast oysters, but now have a profound new favorite. The cerviche was on point as well. The tuna/mango/guacamole cerviche deemed extremely creative and delicious.  2. Guacamole- It is incredibly easy to screw up guac, but Frontera passes the test with flying colors. Perfect blend of salt, cilantro, lime juice, red onion, and tomato. The avocados were fresh and the taste showed that off nicely. 3. 3 Mole Sampler- I would consider myself vetted in Mexican cuisine, especially in the realm of mole. Needless to say, this was my most anticipated dish. Though the flavors were there, the meat was rather dry and tough to chew. The mole sampler was the biggest disappointed and I hope that was due to a off day. Overall Frontera was a good experience that I would recommend to any Mexican cuisine fan.

If you're reading this review in preparation of your dinner, just know ahead of time I'm extremely jealous that you're going and I'm not. Couldn't have been happier with Frontera. We came after the 10:30 am Chicago Architectural Society boat tour (awesome) for a reserved 12:00 lunch. From the second you walk in, you forget that the bustling folks of one of America's largest cities is just to your back, because it is truly a world within a world. Warm yet vibrant, we were excited to dive in! Had to start with the guacamole, which was sublime; creamy, bursting with lime essence, I literally licked the banana leaf it came on clean. The chips were fine, but to be honest they could have served it with tre bark and I would have been equally happy.  We wanted to ensure that we experienced the essence of high-end Mexican street food as well as an authentic, hearty entree, so we went with 2 apps and split an entree. We had the sopes rancheros which were so delicious; small cups of soft corn meal filled with rich, slow cooked beef and tender avocado. I could have eaten 20! The queso fundito was the JAM! Let's just say there's no WRONG way to do chorizo and cheese, so when its done the RIGHT way its out of this world.  The entree was an outstanding OAXACAN-STYLE CARNE ASADA...no doubt you can taste the quality of the spice-rubbed rib-eye. We're not talkin' Applebee's folks, the animal that birthed this rich, flavorful cut of meat did NOT die in vain. If you're a steak person, its a must get.  The dessert was crazy good as well. It was a warm, sweet corn cake served with sweet cream ice cream and some popcorn for that extra umph.

In a city with so many (better) options- I certainly don't intend to go back. Service and atmosphere: up to par with something I would expect from the neighboring Rain Forest Cafe. At first I couldn't understand the 1.5 hour wait. It made sense once we sat down and it took about 15 minutes to even be given water. Another 15 to have our appetizer and drink order taken. In all, we saw our server roughly 3 times during the 2 hours we sat there, such a minimal showing that I can't accurately report on his actual service. However that level of service enables a ridiculously long wait at the hostess stand.  We had only been standing at the hostess stand for a short while when a friend leaned over and described the place quite well: 'tourist trap.' Agreed.  The food was sub par. We had the Frontera Guac, which was seemingly tasteless. If you're going for the guac, don't. Adobo Grill has much better guac and you don't have to wait nearly 2 hours for it. The ceviche was likely the only redeeming factor of the meal. Good- but nothing I would wait in a 2-hour line for.  The queso fundido was good, but such a small portion. I would much rather head to Uncle Julios and get a reasonable sized portion (and we only had 3 people in our party!). I maybe got 2 bites out of it. Pork shoulder tacos. Meant to be an app- it was basically dried up pork shoulder with beans and a side of rice. It was less than tasty. A fellow companion had the duck tacos and said it was cooked well, but it was cold. Apparently our food had to wait in line to get to our table, too.  All in all- I wont be back. There are too many Mexican restaurants in Chicago that are so much better.

2013-09-16,5.0,"We got a table for five at 10PM on Friday the 13th.  I was running late; by the time I joined my party they were already served cocktails.  Etta loved the fresh cucumber and complex tartness of the Xoco margarita.  Her sister Effie thought the Topolo margarita was in the sweet spot between sugary and tart. I was happy to order a bottle of Topochico for myself: the tightness of bubbles pushes this Mexican mineral water to the front of the pack of palette cleansing.  For appetizers we chose two dishes from the raw bar: Yucatecan ceviche of shrimp and squid, deliciously full of citrus notes and habanero, and yellowtail aguachile, silky delicate fish gently marinating with lime and addictive spicy chile arbol hot sauce, with chia seeds lending the texture of roe and savory balance of flavor.  Mr. Cuzco was excellent taking my guest's mushroom allergy back to the chef to ensure that all would be well.  Junior cleared and reset our table before the cavalcade of vegetable small plates. It was a harvest feast of grilled corn on the cob two ways, Swiss chard and potatoes in earthy guajillo chile, long beans from the Bayless' garden in Baja olive oil, smoky grilled tatume squash with fresh cheese, and habit-forming scorched shishito peppers with sea salt.  The table agreed on the grilled corn with serrano mayo over the more rustic red chile and sour cream corn: beyond that everybody had a different winning vegetable.  The vegetarian at the table, Gordon, who also happens to be the lead singer of the Violent Femmes, experienced his favorite of the night, and one of the best soups he has ever had, with the entree course.  He had the Sopa de Guias, a Oaxacan style vegetable broth with the ""three sisters"" of the field: sweet corn, heirloom squash, and runner beans.  He said the depth of flavor and complexity was beyond anything he's tasted in vegetable soup, and was so into adding the fresh cheese and serrano salsa that he dropped out of conversation.  That bowl was the last plate to be surrendered as he savored every taste. The rest of my party split the classic grilled ribeye with hypnotic flavors of beef, red chile and fire, as well as the grilled Alaskan salmon in acidic, spicy, crunchy and beyond amazing salsa of tomatoes grown on the restaurants roof, ripe melons, fall apples and green chile.  The best part was the tomato water, alive with those flavors.  Our other friend Peter fell into the trance of that Friday night special: taco after taco of smoked brisket in black mole.  Effie thought the tortilla soup lived up to the high expectations set by her mother who loved it at her lunch at Topolobampo: she appreciated the nod to French onion soup in the onions' caramelization and how the cream and cheese melted into and enriched the steaming chile broth. The entire table was cleared and cleaned leaving only our water glasses and despite the sudden need for a pair of elastic-waist pants we pushed on to a single shared dessert: the parfait of Concord grapes and Oaxacan chocolate.  The tangy grapes brought to life the raisiny elements of dark chocolate, heightened by the sweet grape compote and puckery whipped cream.  Thank you for an unforgettable dinner that demonstrated the powerful force of a fully conscious team doing farm to table cooking at the height of the harvest, with techniques new and as old as there have been people in the americas.",0.9976,0.844,0.146,0.01,0.5183357248811794
2013-09-15,3.0,"First, let me say that the food is excellent and the service is generally good.  We try to come a few times a year from the Chicago suburbs.  We have frequented both Frontera and on special occasions, Topo.  With the limited reservation policy, we always  start our trek early, so we can be in the front of the inevitable line.  We accept that we will have to wait, and have always felt it was worth it.   We left at 3:00 for an hour and fifteen minute drive in.  Got there by 4:15, and were thrilled to see we were the fourth group in line.  When the staff came out at about ten to five to begin taking names, we were told that our choices were the bar or outside seating, and they would not be able to sit us in the dining room until 8:00 or 8:30!!   Given that the website touts that ""our dining room is mostly seated on a first come, first serve basis"" we were surprised and more than a little put out.  We were told the dining room was mostly filled with reservations!!  We never had this problem before, and given the stated policy, we did not anticipate having this problem now. The bar, especially on Saturday night, gets packed with people standing, waiting, moving in and out, using the restroom, etc., and it definitely detracts from the experience. Outdoor seating is okay, but it was not really what we wanted.  Given our place in line, we anticipated having a choice, including dining room.  We spoke to the manager, who kept telling us he wanted to find a resolution to our issue, but his only suggested resolution was to sit in the bar.  With no real choice, we took outside. The meal was very good as usual, and the server was very good as well, (although sometimes service can be hit or miss).   The whole seating situation definitely was a big negative however.  We don't know what to believe now.  Do we wait the months for a ""limited"" reservation, or take our chances with what has always worked, getting there early and waiting in line?   The answer, unfortunately, is to go somewhere else.  There are plenty of fine restaurants in Chicago, and many fine Mexican restaurants.  It is time to give our business. to them.  Frontera obviously won't miss us, as they are as packed as ever, and apparently have no problem treating the loyal customers waiting patiently on line year after year, as after thoughts.  Perhaps it has just gotten too famous for us.",0.9276,0.853,0.094,0.053,0.46543566362715294

We arrived around 1pm for a late lunch and were greeted and seated quickly. My wife had ordered the street food trio and I went with the Steak Tacos Al Carbon. As an appetizer we ordered the chips and two salsas. For drinks we went with their non alcoholic fruit drink. We ordered our food at the same time the table next to us ordered. They were a party of three, we were a party of two. They were brought out their appetizers and food before we had even received our appetizer. When our waitress noticed that our appetizers had not been served, I observed her speaking with a gentleman behind the counter and then disappearing. The gentleman then brought out the appetizer but made no apology for the delay. The table next to us had finished their meal by the time ours made it to our table. Again with no apology or explanation as to why it took so long for us to receive our meal. The staff really dropped the ball on this one.  The food however was quite tasty. My wife enjoyed her street food trio and I enjoyed my Tacos al carbon.

For our entree, we did the taco platter: steak, chicken and pork.  They were each wonderful and it was hard to pick a favorite, but the pork was amazing.  The spicy marinade paired with the onions was perfect.   Although the host stand seemed to be overwhelmed and not as welcoming as you might expect, service was otherwise excellent, even at the bar.  The bar tenders poured strong, but balanced cocktails and made sure that our drinks and bellys were full.  (Depending what you order, it can get pricey.)

We ordered the trio taco, trio mole and a ribeye dish.  They were all mediorce.  We were looking forward to the meal all week, and left feeling like we paid way too much for bad service and just okay entrees.

I only wish there were more tacos since we really stuffed as much as we could in there and still ran out of tacos too quickly. The Street Food Trio was okay and a bit overpriced for what it was. I enjoyed the Potosinas in it, but that's probably because Frontera Grill uses awesome avocados. For the most part, the flavors were fairly standard. The Red Chile Kale was interesting.

2013-06-26,5.0,"Rick Bayless is definitely one of my favorite chefs.  He's such a down to earth guy and always making delicious looking food on PBS.  After he won top chef master's I knew I had to eventually make a stop at Frontera since I pass through Chicago at least once a year.  Well, now was finally the time. Frontera is a very large restaurant, essentially with two wings.  One side is the bar with couples seating, the other side is more of the sit down restaurant for larger parties.  The tables are packed pretty close together and the place was very packed when we came in.  We ordered the just made tortilla chips w/salsa, bayless garden salad, mole trio, old school frontera trio and sopa de frutas for dessert.   The tortilla chips were indeed fresh, warm, obviously homemade and good but a little under salted.  The Bayless garden salad was fantastic and the star of this dish were the green tomatoes.  They were so incredibly sweet, I could have eaten a gigantic bowl full of them alone.  The mole trio was fan freaking tastic, layers of complex flavors that you knew were made with many ingredients.  My least favorite was the yellow mole and if I had to order a single dish, hands down it would be the black mole.  Out of the old school frontera trio, my favorite was the mexico city style quesadillas, oh my god were they good, the cheese was fantastic and it was so flavorful.  Dessert was pretty standard, the pistachio sorbet was so rich you could have passed it as ice cream.  Although I do wish the amount of sorbet was greater since the dish was loaded with rhubarb and strawberries. Although service was a little spotty from the waitstaff (he was hard to get a hold of) the service from the kitchen was efficient.  Needless to say Frontera is hands down the best Mexican food I've had yet.",0.9968,0.761,0.213,0.026,0.523478835978836

2013-06-22,4.0,"I tend to dislike absurdly popular restaurants; I find it almost invariably not worth braving the seas of humanity that stand between me and getting a table. Certainly, this is how I felt about XOCO, the only other Rick Bayless restaurant I've eaten at. Despite the absurd 2 hour wait, I found Frontera to be generally worth it.  We started with grilled chive guacamole ($9.75), which is far too smooth; it's almost as if it was made in a food processor. I was hugely not a fan of this. Ceviche and oyster sampler ($44 for a full, $23.50 for a half) redeems admirably; in particular, the tropical tuna cocktail, with fresh ahi, tomatillo, avocado, and fresh mango is light and refreshing yet very flavorful. Enchiladas potosinas ($8), miniature fried masa turnovers with a melange of creamy accompaniments, are very decadent but served in small enough bites that the richness doesn't overwhelm the diner. Duck carnitas enchiladas ($13.50) topped with an assertive red chile de arbol sauce, are very solid. Entrees are very shareable; mole trio ($23.50), with vegetables in yellow mole, mole poblano enchiladas, and lamb in mole oaxaceño, offer a nice variety; while the veggies are somewhat forgettable, the lamb is rich and tender, and the mole poblano has an appropriately complex and addictive flavor. Chef's special on our visit was a braised brisket, also topped with mole oaxaceño and served with rich cheesy potatoes, is a very comforting, unique take on a classic pot roast. As a Jew, I'm very finicky about brisket, and this meets my standards. Up to this point in the meal, the food was very good, but nothing was superlative... that all changed with the dark chocolate pecan pie ($7.50); sinfully dark chocolate mixed with chopped pecans, served on a flaky crust, is a very simple yet excellent dessert. Easily the highlight of the meal.  Pricing is somewhat high, and service is good. I will say that, considering the fact that they deal with massive crowds nightly, they do a fairly poor job of managing customers who wait for a long time. We showed up at 5:30, were quoted at 2-2.5 hours, and told to call in 45 minutes because it would likely end up being a shorter wait. When we did call, the hostess simply read off her list that we came in at 5:30 and were quoted at 2-2.5 hours, which... I already knew. I called back again 30 minutes later, expecting to hear a similarly useless response, after which I would cancel, but was told by a different hostess that our table was ready ""right now""... we settled up at the nearby bar where we were drinking, walked over, and found it had been given away. I guess they don't care if they lose clientele, as for every party that says adios, there are five more who would gladly take their place. Still, it's pretty annoying, and were my last memory of Frontera not that delicious pie, this would almost certainly bump them into three-star land for me.  All in all, I will begrudgingly admit that it's easy to see why Frontera's food has generated serious hype; while nothing reinvents the wheel, everything is very solidly executed. As a lifelong Chicagoan who may be leaving, I'm glad that I can now say I roughed out the huddled masses to have eaten here. Would I put up with the clusterfuck of dining here again?

I can't tell you about the food, as we left before ever sitting down -- this review is on the attitude of the staff only. After watching Rick's show for many years, we wanted to try his well-known restaurant. We walked over the day before we wanted to dine there and spoke to some workers who were setting up tables and asked for a reservation for the following day. They said they couldn't take a reservation at that time, but to call tomorrow and make one by phone. Ok, next day we do just that and are told they don't take reservations by phone, but to just show up and get in line at 4:15ish for the 5:00 opening and we would get a table (we had 7:30 show tickets and told them this on the phone.) Ok, no problem -- we show up at 4:15 and are about the 3rd people in line. We wait until 5:00 when an extremely annoyed employee with a rotten attitude slowly opens the doors and herds in the now very large crowd. We make our way to the front desk and see that beepers are being given out and that there were no tables available (one peek in the dining room showed an empty room!) When we told the attitude queen our plight, he rolled his obviously dyed eyelashes and basically said that was too damn bad for us.

Some of the entrees ordered were the 2 different carne asadas...Oaxacan and Bravo and a chicken dish.  The Oaxacan was by far the best!  You can't go wrong with it.  For dessert, I believe we had the flan sampler and home made ice cream.  Delicious!",0.9753,0.83,0.17,0.0,0.5958333333333333

The second visit was much more leisurely. The street food is delicious. The corn tamales were my absolute favorite and I had them on each visit. Also, I highly recommend the black beans with yams - holy yum. Some of the items were a little on the spicy side, so if you don't like spice I recommend asking your waiter for recommendations.  While the small plates were pretty small, be prepared for absolutely enormous dessert portions.

We ordered guac and 2 salsas, but only the guac came with the chips. So we had to divide and conquer with limited chip selection which was kind of a bummer. The tacos were good. Very tasty. We did the 3 taco platter with pork, chicken and steak. They tasted great but didn't have the extra ""kick"" I wanted.

The main dishes and starters are 5 stars--I tried a total of 8 dishes as we were sharing. Highlights--the wood grill meat tacos, especially the **duck**.  The meat in general is excellent, and the goat, best goat I have ever had. All of the food was so good, really. I had dishes with goat, duck, beef, spicy pork. The recipes are delicious.  But the guacamole was nothing to write home about--it isn't bad, it just isn't special and I know many people who make great homemade guac. The atmosphere is festive, the art nice. Why they lose a star and almost 2: For the price of things in here, the drinks should be BIGGER and better. The margaritas should be called margarita-tinies, since they are one gulp, seriously, a fortune to pay for such a tiny drink. The mixed drinks simply were not great--mixes not made with all fresh ingredients I think like the mojitos which def were not all homemade ingredients--the mix tasted undissolved.  I would stick to beer or wine, an excellent list. and getting a waiter's attention can be challenging, but the kicker was that our waiter brought something to our table and let on like it was a mistake and a bit of a laugh/joke, and just set it down without even asking us, but he did not indicate the price of it. We then found out after trying a bit that it was a platter for dessert and $25.  If you are going to be charging more than a few dollars you need to let the table know. It is just a sneaky way to push the desserts, and I don't like that. A dessert menu or a dessert trolly/cart shows or tells the prices. The desserts were exceptional by the way, but you have to inform customers.

I will admit, while very delicious.. the hype made it a little less impressive. The wait time is absolutely ridiculous. We waited for a good hour, went down the street to an Irish pub (which was awesome) and had a few drinks. We then returned for another hour of waiting (and more drinks). Finally, we were seated. This place is crazy busy at all times. By 7, the wait had become 3 or more hours. So don't plan on coming here unless you have a senior citizen dinner time (like us) or you've made reservations at least 4 months in advance. That being said, our food was very good. The salsa was fairly spicy but the guacamole was very well prepared! I actually prefer the street food above the actual entrees. The fresh corn tamale had a sweet flavor to it which enhanced the poblano peppers. Very good! We also had some sort of trio. I highly recommend this is it's a good opportunity to try different things. While I don't remember all of the dishes, I do recall a very good pork roasted fajita with a mole sauce.  The best part of all of this was the blood orange margarita prepared at the table.

However he was a little more attentive to the local ladies rather than my traveling lonely self. I spent $36 on 3 small plates. Pork Fundido was good but pretty rich cheese could have used more meat. This is something you want to share as I find it hard to finish all the cheese alone. Mushroom Empanadas crust or masa was nice and crispy and pretty good. Duck Tacos were darn good. Enough food by far for one person. Bartender told me they were pretty small but the duck tacos easily made three and maybe four. Could have done that and one app. Place was a little dirty for what I would expect from a well known place from the bathroom to the entire venue.

2013-04-30,3.0,"""Though our dining room is mostly seated on a first come first serve basis, we take a limited amount of reservations for all size parties."" ^^  That's what it says on the website.  If MOST of the dining room is first come, first serve, then you should not have to wait three hours for a table with a short wait list.  Yet that was the wait this weekend when we got there at 5:00.  We decided not to make reservations because we weren't quite sure how long it would take to get the the restaurant from our show.  Big mistake.  While we waited, about 90% of the others who showed up and were told about the wait immediately turned around and left.  I can't believe they manage to have so much business when they are nightly turning away that many disgruntled would-be customers.  We only waited because I was visiting from California, and this place has been kind of a ""bucket list"" destination for me for a while now.  So before I get to the food, please, PLEASE change your website to reflect that reservations are HIGHLY recommended.   In our famished state, we ordered a Yucatan ceviche to start off.  It was good, and we thought a great start to our meal.  Then the main courses came.  I actually elected to get the Street Food Trio rather than an ""entree"" because I was really excited to get an overview of what Frontera had to offer.  When my plate came, I was shocked at what a small amount of food it was.  ""Snack size"" CANNOT be overstated here.  Each of the six pieces (two of three different street foods) were two bites each, max, meaning my meal was 12 bites at best.  My date kept trying to force feed me food from his own plate.  I really didn't mind (more room for dessert), but the food wasn't that great...even when I was dying of hunger.  The sopes were the highlight (I could have eaten a few of those), but the potosinas and huarache tasted dry, overcooked, and just kind of lousy.  My date's taco trio was much more satisfying, though only four tortillas for a HUGE platter of food was a joke.  He ate more than half with his fork.   Meanwhile at the bar, two of the bartenders got into a fight.  One guy started yelling at the other after getting accidentally bumped, and the whole thing escalated until one was backing the other against the wall, they were yelling until their faces were red, and I was certain we were about to see them go to blows.  FINALLY after FAR too long, another bartender came in and broke it up, and we missed the dinner entertainment.  I was so bewildered by this whole fiasco that I didn't even notice when Rick Bayless himself scooted in right next to me on the bench seat against the wall to chat with a group of friends.  Suddenly dozens of people needed to use the restroom so that they had a reason to walk by the table to take a picture of him.  Our table also started getting lots of attention from the waiters and hostess, trying to look more attentive, since he was sitting right next to us.  Amusing, really. Dessert was a chocolate peanut butter cheesecake with a mango-chile sorbet/salsa.  These were both delicious in their own right, though had no business being paired together.  They were still the highlight of the meal when eaten separately, and the chocolate cappuccino was also very good.  It did make me rather sad that the best thing we ate at this notorious Mexican restaurant was a chocolate peanut butter cheesecake.   So that was our night.  We waited, we ate, we saw Rick Bayless.  Would I wait three hours for this food again?  No way, Jose.  Would I have given it 4-5 stars if I had made reservations and had been seated within 30 minutes?  Moot point, because I don't really think it's worth coming again.  Bucket list item checked off.  There's a whole city full of amazing food in Chicago, and I'm sure I can find better on my next visit.",0.9742,0.837,0.097,0.066,0.5090630511463843

Perhaps Frontera was at one point authentic and delicious but that time has passed. The whole experience felt corporate like the Mexican version of Cheesecake Factory or the Mexican restaurant in Epcot.   Unlike most diners we got lucky and we got a table within minutes on a busy Friday night due to a cancellation. If we had to wait an hour or two I think I would have been irate when the $400 bill arrived because everything was so terribly mediocre.  First, as for drinks, the little novelty where the margaritas are mixed at the tables is lame and pandering. I felt like I was in Epcot center. And, who serves margaritas in tiny martini glasses? Also, shouldn't the servers ask if we want the drinks on the rocks, w/ or w/o salt? Whether they should or they shouldn't, the feeling I got was that they didn't care. The service was rushed, with waiters and helpers tossing the plates on the table regardless of drinks and things in the way, and spitting out a fast explanation of what was what and running away. They did take their time to upsell us on everything though -- more drinks, more desserts, more after-dinner drinks -- asking many many times. A lot of folks seem to talk about the margaritas but they were too sweet in my opinion no real umph, just like the food which was completely blah. No real spice or deep flavor. Very one-note and not one thing would I consider ""hot."" The street food appetizer platter tasted like fried crap in frozen boxes from Cosco and the moles were all sweet without any depth. We ordered quite a bit: * guac and chips -- no big deal, chips very thick * ceviche sampler -- eh, only the tuna with sundried tomatoes was memorable * streetfood sampler - see above * mole trio -- all sweet, no depth  * chicken in green sauce -- bland and unmemorable; wish it wasn't just a piece of grilled chicken and was more of a roasted or stewed chicken * roast duck -- the best thing we ordered but the cuts of the duck were very very fatty and there was very little actual meat on the plate Overall a complete disappointment.

The mango guacamole was quite tasty as well. I like the hint of the mango as there were pieces mixed in. I ordered the Fish in Yucatecan Pipian. My friends ordered the Duck Enchilada, Duck in Tamarind, and the Old School Frontera Trio. My fish dish was absolutely awesome. I love spicy and this totally hit the spot. I tried all my friend's dishes and they were very flavorful and yummy. The handmade tortillas are also really good here. We finished the night off with the Chocolate, Peanut & Mango Cheesecake along with the Date & Coconut Cake. Both were very rich and decadent. I loved the textures and combination. My only complaint is portion size. I was afraid that I'd have to eat something more at home if I didn't get dessert to fill me up. Well, I do think it is a little pricey as well. I would definitely consider this more of a gourmet Mexican meal. If you are looking for cheap eats, this wouldn't be it. I would love to come back and highly recommend for the complex flavors of the food.",0.9958,0.803,0.191,0.007,0.5312037037037036

We had guacamole, which was made  EXACTLY the way it should be. My husband enjoyed mixing and matching hot sauces with it to create the right amount of kick for him. He ordered the gorditas and I had Iriquois hot cakes. The flavor of the hot cakes was unlike anything I've had before. The syrup had the flavor of caramelized sugar without tasting burnt, and went perfectly with the cinnamon goat cheese on top. The red chile rubbed bacon was delicious. The chile did not overpower the flavor of the bacon. The odd ball on the plate was two sunny side up eggs which were good, but totally bland compared to the rest of the plate.

The menu wasn't very clear either.  I get it now that the street food section is supposed to be like a first course but my son had the trio as his entree and it was not enough.  That reminds me I have to order a pizza because they are still hungry.  The duck in tamarind didn't have much flavor, certainly not tamarind or chile and the spinach was strong flavored in a bad way.  It was served with little corn cakes that were like undercooked polenta (pasty) and the pickle on the plate was too sweet not pickle enough.  The quesadillas, pork tacos, and lamb special were all good but no one wants to go back.  We get better Mexican food in Pilsen and Heart of Chicago and a lot of other places in Chicago.  There's even a Mexican restaurant in a gas station that has great Mexican food out south.  The Mojita was warm when it got to the table and the beer was served in a water glass so that it looked like a glass of apple juice. The dessert menu didn't tempt us so we went to XOCO for churros and hot chocolate.  The churros (although everyone likes the ones I get in Heart of Chicago better) were wonderful but the chocolate is really for the chocolate lover.  I didn't notice any of the usual cinnamon flavor in my hot chocolate which i had made with water.  I enjoyed mine but two of my group couldn't drink theirs The prices were surprisingly not as high as i thought though.  Five of us with drinks and tip for less than $200 at lunch. It was very busy.  It took 15 minutes for the drinks to arrive.  We waited 30 minutes for our ceviche and probably another 25 for our food.  And it was too loud.  We couldn't hear each other.  I don't enjoy my dining experience because the acoustics make the place seem like there are 100's of people eating.",0.9934,0.789,0.15,0.061,0.47750253292806477

2013-02-25,2.0,"I think the overall ranking of this place should be three stars, so I'm trying to balance things out a little. I was very disappointed by this place. My first shot was brunch on Saturday morning.  We waited for about an hour and when we were finally seated I felt like I was in a cafeteria with sticky tables. We first ordered drinks and I made the mistake of asking for a flavored margarita with Mezcal. The drink was so sweet I had to return it (it tasted as if someone filed half the glass with corn syrup) for a plain margarita that was ok. We wound up getting the appetizer trio and I ordered one of the egg dishes as my entree. All in all, the food was uninspiring. My second visit was for lunch with co-workers. The place was about half full and it took 25 minutes for our food to arrive from the moment we ordered. The guacamole came a little earlier. I ordered the enchiladas with huitlacoche and, once again, I was terribly disappointed by the food. I get that they use great ingredients, though the mushrooms were seriously lacking in flavor, but it seems like the cooks are half-assing everything. Apart from the fact that the concept of this dish was off, so was the execution. The dish arrived lukewarm, the mole didn't taste fresh and the special tortilla was soggy (not in a good way). It's like they're going through the motions of cooking the recipes without putting any soul to it. All in all, do yourself a f(l)avor and go to Xoco next door, which has much better food.

The decor is very unique, doesn't feel like a traditional River North restaurant, more like that mexican strip mall joint you stop in occasionally. Cocktails were fantastic, I had two made with mezcal and my girlfriend had two different margaritas. Both were very unique and tasty. For food we started with guacamole/salsa with chips and a oyster/ceviche platter. The guacamole was good, but nothing special and the salsa, very delicious. The platter was fantastic, the oysters were fresh and served with two unique sauces, a nice break from the traditional garnish. The Frontera and Tuna ceviches were fantastic, unique flavors and very good.  Already pretty full, we then split the sopes rancheros and grilled knob onions. Both highly recommended, full of flavor and unique.  Best part of the meal was the service, our server was very attentive and knowledgeable on the whole menu.

I came in late on a chilly Wednesday night and although my party of 2 was sat immediately the dining room was still lively. We put together a meal of some of the smaller offerings and split an order of the vegetarian enchiladas. Everything was super tasty and stood out with the delicious sauces that is a signature of Bayless' cooking. For dessert we went with the pastel de chocolate and the hot chocolate. Although I thought the hot chocolate is done so much better at XOCO, the pastel de chocolate was a delicious and well-constructed dessert that I enjoyed more than any of the sweets offered at Topolobampo.

Did I also mention that the menu was surprisingly overpriced? Well, it is, and if I spend around 25$ for an entree in a mexican restaurant the minimum that I would like to get is a warm meal. - the dining room was overcrowded as well, I had no room to move without hitting my neighbor behind me. At least they were kind enough to take care of the coats. - we got a margarita and a bloody mary, they were nothing special. Overall my experience was, well... terrible.

My experience with Mexican food has been simple. As a child, I remember eating elotes from the food cart in the park and homemade Mexican dinners that would put me in a coma for hours. I've had every type of ""meat/tortilla combo you can name throughout the years. I make my own salsa and put way too much tapatio on everything I eat. I'm no expert (I did share the meal here with who would be though of as expert though, he wasn't impressed), but if there is something I know, its Mexican food. In addition, I am not afraid to pay 5 star prices for a 5 star meal once in a while, but when the value/cost is so out of balance, I have to speak up. I not only did I leave still feeling hungry, I also wasn't all that impressed with the rich ""authentic"" Mexican flavors Mr. Bayless always talks about.  I still give Frontera three stars because some of the flavors were good (the guac trio was excellent). For all the hype that goes along with this place, I just don't taste what all the fuss is about. The food is RELATIVELY good, if your experience with Mexican is fairly limited then I guess I could see the flavors being amazing. This definitely isn't your local Pepe's but I was left empty. The ceviche was good but a little less than a shot glass was served as part of the appetizer. The rest of my meal was less memorable than the bill we received in the end.

I've been wanting to try one of Bayless's REAL restaurants for a while after trying his overachieving airport food from Tortas Frontera at O'Hare. Somehow I managed to snag a lunch reservation three days in advance, but I have a feeling that's not the norm - so book early! We arrived on time and I was surprised to see that the restaurant was completely empty - had just opened at 11:30. They took our coats (which turned out to be really helpful because the seating situation was cozy, but would have become cramped if we and the other patrons had our coats) and we were seated promptly in a half booth. Unfortunately, I was facing the wall so I didn't really get a chance to see the restaurant fill up or to get an idea of the atmosphere. I also never saw my waiter's face - he only ever stood behind us and the two of us facing the wall had to crane our necks to see him.  The food was fantastico. The guacamole was some of the best I've had; good but not overwhelming portion of the green chile (just enough for an added kick), and the cilantro gave it that little extra kick that made it so fab. The salsa that was brought to the table was phenomenal. I mean really, really. Loved both the spicy red (three chile?) and the smoky tomatillo. Biggest complaint is that those portions were barely enough for one person, let alone the four of us who were diving our chips into them nonstop. We shared the Yucatecan Ceviche, which was a better portion for four, and had great flavors - again, loved the cilantro and especially with the shrimp, calamari, and orange flavors. I devoured my enchiladas (wish I could remember the name but I'm not seeing it on the online menu) - they were stuffed with mushrooms and had a great side of rice and a tomatillo sauce on the side. It was great but I wish I had gone a little farther out of my comfort zone and tried some of the street food or maybe one of the trios - which all looked excelente as well. This is definitely not your average Mexican restaurant, and I would save it for a time when you know you can savor the food and won't feel rushed to make a decision on what to order.

Food I love chile rellenos and it is a treat to eat them since they are pretty time-consuming to make and my past attempts have produced some not-so-good results. So unless my mom is cooking, I rarely get to indulge. I had heard great things about the chiles rellenos at Frontera, including that they sell out quickly so I was excited to try this off the menu. They certainly did not disappoint - try them! The salsa was very flavorful and not as spicy, but the poblano pepper had a bit of kick for the perfect spice level. My favorite was the filling; the ground pork had great texture due to slivered almonds and had great flavor. The batter was light and fluffy, not greasy which is very common. Overall Had a good experience here, but honestly, not sure I'd be willing to wait in a line for 2+ hours (if you don't have a reservation & those have to be made far in advance) when you can get some quality Mexican food elsewhere with way better service.

We were there for lunch and the place was hopping! The decor is pretty typical of most Mexican spots - lots of bright colours and Mexican scenery and traditional-style paintings on the wall. It's a lively spot for sure! I was really impressed with our server. He took us newbies through the menu which was great, considering I'm always hesitant when it comes to ordering Mexican. I LOVE it, but I'm not a fan of super hot spice. He let us know the only thing that was really intense was the spicy mushrooms so I steered clear from those! I had a delicious limonata drink and it was a perfect start to the meal. Our table ordered some ceviche and guacamole which were both quite good. The homemade corn tortillas were perfect! After chowing down on those, I wasn't starving, so I ordered the tortilla soup and roasted chicken taquitos. The taquitos were a really small serving (I think there were maybe 4 or 5 of them) held together with more guac - YUM! The tortilla soup was served in a bowl with the crisps and onions and cheese, and then the broth was poured over it in front of us - SO yummy! I really loved the soup, but it was a tad on the salty side. The taquitos were decent, but I thought they were a bit lacking in the flavor department (I know - from the girl who doesn't like spicy!). The tortillas were wonderful and the chicken was perfectly cooked though. If you're a fan of Mexican, I'd definitely recommend stopping by this spot when you're in Chi town.

Time and time again you hear what a genius Rick Bayless is and how Frontera is one of the best restaurants in the entire country. It goes on and on. This is amazing and that is amazing and on and on and on. Hype kills, my friends. Many a cultural monolith has been felled by hype. So how could anything possibly live up to the hype of this place? I don't know, but Frontera does it. Food, service, atmosphere, heck even price for what you're getting, Frontera is pretty much as perfect as any earthbound restaurant is ever going to get.  Obviously, it's an extremely busy place. Yet they have the system there down to a science, making the whole process of waiting surprisingly efficient. On a similar note, the wait staff is amazing. To say they are on top of things is an understatement. They know all of the insides and outs of the food they are serving and are able to make suggestions in such informative ways that it never feels like a sales pitch. Plus they're quick, efficient, and friendly in that important genuine kind of way. The food. Oh man the food. How can something taste this good? I mean, it's just everything went into a different scale of deliciousness than anything I've eaten before. That's how you live up to hype. By adding entirely new flavor experiences. So add to the brilliant menu, an amazing selection of drinks, including a Goose Island beer brewed only for Frontera, and the culinary delights are impossible to top. Sometimes things don't deserve the accolades they receive. I could name numerous things, but would likely only end up offending far too many people.

2012-10-28,5.0,"I moved to Illinois - and Chicagoland specifically - the summer of 2005. One night at work, down in the pressroom waiting to check on a page, I was chatting with the press guy. He told me he'd just celebrated his wedding anniversary at a fancy downtown Mexican restaurant. It was the first time I heard about Rick Bayless and his little empire at the corner of Clark and Illinois. Fast forward through job changes, a wedding, several moves and to now... our five-year wedding anniversary. We've eaten at XOCO several times and Topolo is out of our price range comfort zone, but Frontera? We can swing that. When going to well-known restaurants like this, there seems to be a danger that it will be overhyped. Thank god, Frontera completely lived up to our expectations. Rick Bayless is a freaking genius. We arrived in line about 4:30 on a Saturday, and I ran around the corner to XOCO to grab some hot chocolate to combat the chill (I would like to suggest this, you can get to-go items at XOCO quite quickly). A short time later they opened the hallway door and started taking names and handing out buzzers. We were told we'd be seated at 5:40 in the main dining room. At 5, the bar doors opened and we were let in, and sure enough our buzzer went off right after 5:40. We decided on a small-plates style dinner. Here's what we had and notes: Drinks -- husband had the Goose Island Marisol; I had JJ's Elixir: Fig-infused Riverboat rye whiskey, cinnamon agave, fresh lime, JK Scrumpy's hard cider.   -- Strong, warm, delicious, a perfect fall cocktail. Fall Guacamole: Pickled jalapenos, grilled local apples, homemade fresh cheese. Tortilla chips.  -- a perfect starter, creamy, a little bite but not very spicy, delicious.  Street Food Trio: Two pieces each: potosinas (fresh cheese, avocado, crema, Tamazula), tlacoyos (red chile beans, guajillo salsa, cincho cheese), sopes (shredded beef, roasted tomato, green chile).   -- each bite was better than the next. I think the potosinas were my favorite bite, the combination of cheese, crema, guacamole and hot sauce was just divine.  Fresh Corn Tamales: Banana leaf-steamed sweet corn tamales, homemade crema & fresh cheese, poblano.  -- super sweet, with just the right hint of saltiness and creamy fresh cheese.  Smoked Pork Queso Fundido: Otter Creek organic cheddar, guajillo-rubbed smoked pork, grilled knob onions, guajillo salsa. -- very rich, the pork was tender and so delicious, the cheese tangy, served with fresh corn tortillas. While it didn't seem like a *ton* of food, we were happily pretty full at this point, and decided to cap our evening with a little ice cream -- the homemade Mexican vanilla with goat's milk caramel. It was divine. We both agreed we could've happily drunk a glass of the caramel, which had tangy and smokey notes next to the traditional caramel profile.  Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and timed things perfectly, and our waters were always kept refilled and plates cleared. It was a fantastic dinner and the perfect way to mark five memorable years.",0.9993,0.729,0.245,0.026,0.5652162014230979

I mean I was ready to walk out of there before our entrees came. The Tamale should have been chicken however it was pork, at least it had the taste and texture of pork. Now, we are waiting another 15 min for the bill. Really ?!?! Overall, we wanted to just get the hell out of there. The best part comes Saturday, we both start experiencing stomach cramps, because I am the bigger eater my cramps were more severe followed by DIARRHEA and CHILLS !!! Seriously!! Enough said..

All three items were delicious and I couldn't wait till my entrée is served.  When my duck breast taco finally arrived, I couldn't wait to dig in. The good part of the entrée is that I got warm tortilla and I can build my own taco. However, the highlight of the dish - the duck breast - lacked flavor complexity and was somewhat chewy.  In terms of service, I found it difficult to get the attention of the servers while seated next to the wall and a room partition.

2012-09-20,4.0,"I love Rick Bayless, and I love gourmet Mexican food. Frontera was a pioneer of this cuisine in America, and I am appreciative of the restaurant's importance. I hate to admit that I thought it was just average. When it comes to Mexican food, I love Rosario's in San Antonio, Condesa in Austin or Red Iguana in Salt Lake City. Their portions are reasonable, the dishes are creative, and the food is amazing. Like Border Grill in Los Angeles, I found Frontera to not excel at any of these. We ordered a rather expensive appetizer trio, but the portions were so small that we consumed the entire platter in less than 3 bites a person. I know ... I know ... I'm supposed to say, ""Aren't those taquitos so small and so cute, and that bite just explodes with flavor."" Baloney. I don't need lots of food, but I do like to feel that I got enough to justify a $20 expense. With that said, the best deal was the $9.95 chips and guac. The chips were warm and fresh, and the guac (which I don't really like that much) was excellent. The salsas were perhaps my favorite item of the whole night. As others have noted, the fried plantains with cheese topping are the bomb. Again, I'm going to be a cheap skate and complain about the drink sizes. The margaritas were $11, and the quality was excellent. The glass -- well, it was about the size of a shot glass. Ok, maybe 2 shot glasses. But bring me a big margarita -- if Chili's can make me a fake one in a big glass for $5, surely Frontera can make one with tequila and lime juice that is a decent size for $11.  I love creative food, and I have a strong appreciation for quality. But I have a real pet peeve about places that think they can serve small portions and charge exorbitant amounts for them on the grounds that it small = extraordinary. It doesn't equal extraordinary. It doesn't make the place more elite. It simply makes it pretentious and a waste of resources. Don't get me wrong. I love the atmosphere. The service was attentive. The food was colorful and creative, but nothing blew me away based on the other Mexican restaurants I've enjoyed.

So considering we got in right away on a Saturday night, was perfection right there. The weather was beautiful and we had the option of sitting outside but preferred to sit inside to get the whole frontera experience. It was a little too hott in there for my liking, but also part of the authentic experience. Those fans they have inside need to be cranked up a bunch :)  Now onto the service, ours moved really fast, we were out of there within an hour and we got a lot of food, let me tell you. We started with the much talked about guacamole and chips, I thought it was good, very good, but not out of this world amazing, so I probably wouldn't get it again. The chips and the red salsa was to die for, one of the best salsa's I've ever had, so next time, all about the salsa. We got the skirt steak tacos with sauteed onions and guacamole as one entree which was alright, nothing out of the ordinary and we had the Chile Poblano enchiladas which was my favorite entree there, a bit spicy, the mole had a unique flavor and it was a fun dish to try. However, the winner of the night were the fried plantains with sour cream and some kind of cheese, omg, I'm still dreaming about them, they are freaking ahhh-may--zing, Rick Bayless, can you please serve those plaintains at XOCO as I think they would do really well and I go to Xoco a LOT.  So overall, good and fast service, yummy food and a great time. However, XOCO is where my heart lies for Rick Bayless. He won me over with the Goat Barbacoa sandwich a long time ago.

We ate significantly less food than what was typical of us at a restaurant and for a nice change of pace we were perfectly sated afterwards- we had eaten just enough and were left only wanting more for the sheer desire to taste everything.

2012-09-12,4.0,"The overall Frontera experience was probably about 4.25/5. Upon entry at around 8:45-9pm on a Tuesday we were greeted by a host who immediately showed us to an open table near the bar. I think this might be a good time to arrive if you don't mind eating later, because according to the other reviews it can be quite a pain in the ass to get seated during peak times.  We started off with their Blue Agave Margarita with Cazadores Reposado substituted for the default blanco and the Yucatan ceviche.  The drinks arrived after about 3 minutes and were rather delicious. The lime and the tequilla were married expertly with a hint of Cointreau, which left us both impressed...it justified the 11.50 price. The ceviche arrived next in a cocktail glass with lime chips on a small plate. It was very tasty, fresh and just as it should be. The only complaint was that it left me wanting more (being more accustomed to larger 'merican-sized portions, I guess).  For the main course we both ordered the Tacos al Carbon. I chose catfish and my fiancee ordered the chicken. It took probably 12 minutes or so to arrive, but was timed pretty well so we didn't have much of a wait after our ceviche was finished. Also, I requested 'actually spicy' habenero salsa which the waiter was happy to oblige. The tacos were delicious, with a near-perfect portion size and very tasty guac on the side. The habenero salsa was spicy, slightly tangy and made me sweat a little bit (like it should). The other salsas weren't nearly as spicy, but I can tell a good salsa when I taste it and these were all 4.5 or better. That was the good. Following are the reasons that I subtracted .75 points from the review:    1) After ordering our dinner (the tacos) the waiter suggested to me that we order some rice, beans or another side. I didn't prompt for this or ask any questions about the portion size, so it was strange. For an establishment of this caliber I don't expect or appreciate attempts at up-selling.   2) Upon having our tacos served our waiter made a mention that if we needed more tortillas we could just ask...which was fine. However, between two people we only had 5 very small tortillas. Although they were fresh and delicious, why couldn't they just give us enough in the first place?...and at least give 6 for two people! We had to wait probably 3-4 minutes to get the waiters attention and request more.  tl;dr Great drinks, great food, prompt service (mostly), but an up-sell attempt and a slight attention-to-detail problem required a .75 point deduction. I'll go back for sure. Cheers.",0.9953,0.83,0.139,0.031,0.46497942386831276
2012-09-10,2.0,"I will be the first to admit that I had fairly high expectations for Frontera Grill.  And it was just an all-around disappointment.  The service was ridiculously slow, which I can deal with on a busy night if the food is good, but the food wasn't.  Every single dish except for one came out lukewarm at best and the flavors were ok, but not stellar.  The only two dishes that came out both warm and flavorful were the brothy corn esquites and the poc chuc (grilled pork).  The poc chuc was my favorite dish of the evening - the spicy black bean soup was really good and the pork itself was very tasty.  The smoked chicken queso fundido was near inedible (or it would have been if we hadn't been STARVING after waiting so long) as it was room temperature and congealed.  Plus the cheddar was just too sharp for fundido and overwhelmed the flavor of the chicken and the salsa.  The fresh corn tamales would have been tasty if served hot or even warm, but they were delivered to us room temperature.  The duck enchiladas were warm and ok, but they were really sweet.  I really like pineapple, but it was literally all you could taste.  The traditional guacamole was fine, as were the chips served along side the guacamole, but overall the restaurant wasreally ""meh.""  I hope it was just an off night with both the kitchen and the wait staff or maybe we just ordered all of the wrong dishes (with the exception of the pork).",0.9919,0.794,0.179,0.027,0.5354834054834055

2012-09-04,5.0,"Rick Bayless is truly the Godfather of Yucatan/Mexican cuisine. I have been a huge fan of his since my teens (having purchased the Frontera Grill line of salsas and hot sauce growing up), and now I can finally say that I've tasted his amazing food first hand. And perhaps die a happy gal, too. Seriously, though, the food at Frontera Grill is unlike that I've ever had at any Mexican restaurant in the past. Trust me, I've had my share of authentic Mexican food. While Bayless' food isn't exactly 100% authentic by any means, it is absolutely perfect because he embraces the most pronounced flavors and nuances about Yucatan cuisine and elevates it to a whole other level. Everything here is sophisticated in terms of flavors and execution, yet still approached for the everyday diner.  Knowing that Frontera Grill can get awfully packed during peak dining hours, the bf and I popped in for Saturday brunch a little after 10:30am. It was a good thing we came early, because a massive line had already congregated in the waiting area as we were leaving just before noon. The brunch menu is also a very affordable way to experience Bayless' food, as most menu items fell within $6 to $20. Portions were incredibly generous as well, unlike most other semi-nice restaurants operated by celebrity chefs. - Bajio-style eggs: I ordered this very brunchy dish consistinz of two perfectly poached eggs in crispy masa boats, black beans, and homemade chorizo in a creamy green poblano sauce. The poblano sauce was smooth and just slightly creamy, impressively balanced with a delicate hint of spice that didn't overwhelm the rest of the ingredients. I really loved that the masa cakes had some body, really holding up to the sauce and toppings. The eggs were impeccably poached as well, with the whites just slightly coddled but not completely solidified. It was all around a fine dish, and definitely one of the best egg dishes I've had in a while. - Enchiladas with steak & eggs: this was the bf's entree choice, mostly because it seemed a little more appropriate for brunch than the more popular chicken enchiladas with mole. He really liked the flavor of the dish, especially as he normally isn't a fan of enchiladas due to the oftentimes overly watery and bland sauce. The roasted tomato-serano chile sauce lightly ladled over these bad boys were nothing like that - the red sauce was flavorful and complex and nothing short of amazing. Even I enjoyed the tender and flavorful steak wrapped inside the fresh corn tortillas, as beef normally doesn't appeal to me nor does tough preparations of carne asada. Besides our stellar brunch entrees, our friendly waitress was also kind enough to bring a small dish of Chef Bayless' famous mole to try. The dark mole was so complex and robust in flavor that even one tiny spoonful was enough to send my tastebuds into overdrive. I could've sworn that the cinnamon, nutmeg, chocolate, and various seeds and spices were doing the cha-cha in my mouth.  Everything about my first experience at Frontera Grill was magnificent.

We were maybe the 30th/31st people in line, and by the time we were seated, the restaurant was only half filled, so it looks like they can seat about 60-ish people at a time. I was really impressed by the extensive margarita menu, since there were just a bunch of options and I love margaritas (but who doesn't?). I opted for the white peach basil margarita, which sounds amazing in concept, but was just way too sickeningly sweet in practice. My roomie got the summer margarita, which was incredible and I was super jealous. We proceeded to get the entrees. I ordered the pozole rojo, which is a stew of pork and hominy with red chili. I was looking for something light and soups usually are, but this was underwhelming. I can't quite put my finger on it but it felt like it was missing something. My roomie got a dish that was like a mexican version of eggs benedict (I think it was called huevos con masa but I can't be sure). It was two poached eggs, sitting atop corn-based english muffins, with some kind of hollandaise sauce infused with chili.  Total after tax and tip for our two entrees and two drinks was around $60. I concede that my roommate ordered better than me in all cases at this meal.

2012-08-04,4.0,"At long last, I finally found myself in Chicago in a hotel that was walking distance to Frontera. I've been eyeing this restaurant for a couple years, so was thrilled to finally get the chance to try Chef Bayless' flagship. Unfortunately, I thought I could do so easily after 8 PM on a Tuesday night. Not so. My partner in dining crime and I were told the wait for 2 would be upwards of 45 minutes, so we circled the bar like hawks until we could get a seat to eat there--which was about a 15 minute wait instead. The atmosphere at the bar is great, so we definitely did not feel short-changed. This being my first trip to Frontera, I wanted to order small plates so I could get a sampling of the style. I started with the scallop ceviche, which was nearly perfect. The shaved jicama rounds were a nice textural contrast to the silky scallops. And though pineapple is one of my least-favorite flavors, the sweetness of the juice was a nice contrast to the acid and spice from the lightly toasted Serrano chiles. I just would have preferred the juice of a different sweet fruit, like peach (but that's a personal palate preference, not a knock on the dish). I knocked off a star on my rating because of the wait in between my scallops and second dish, the chicken mole enchiladas. The pace of the meal and quality of service started fine, but we had to wait 30 minutes between our starters and second course, which is just outrageous. Ultimately, the wait proved to be worth it for the three little chicken enchiladas with incredibly complex mole. I have to admit: I'm not the biggest mole fan, but knew I had to order something with mole here. Mole to me tends to be a little vinegary, but Frontera's was anything but. I actually found it to be primarily sweet and smoky, which I really loved.

Also, I want to give a big shout out to David our waiter, he was spectacular and very helpful to me with the decision making process. We started off with the Enchiladas Potosinas and they were exploding with flavor. The masa was ""chile spiked"" and very tasty.

My main entree was the Smoky-Creamy-Spicy Mushrooms. So good. Beautifully smoky. The flavors of all of the dishes were magnificent and complex.

Nonetheless, a review is a review. So here goes... I started with, what I believe was called, the Gold Star Margarita. And it was delish. I'm pretty sure it was fresh lime juice, which made all the difference.  Then we ordered the Tropical Tuna Cocktail and that was very mediocre. I didn't think the mango paired well with the guacamole. And as we continued to eat, I felt more like I was eating out of obligation of having ordered it, rather than because it was amazing.  Then came the main dishes. I hear Bayless is known for his mole's so we ordered the Mole Trio, hoping to get a variety (it's the spice, no?). All three moles were sooooo blah. Nothing stood out--to either of us. I mean, I was really shocked. We didn't finish any of the three tiny dishes. We also ordered the Ocean Trout in Peanut Salsa. I'm pretty sure the trout wasn't fully cooked. It was pretty pink and sushi-like in the center. The peanut sauce was tasty. But it wasn't enough to make me want to devour the plate in front of me.  So with all that being said, both of us had a C- experience. (at least we both agreed that we were very unimpressed). Could it be because we began eating at 10pm? Maybe the chefs were tired and the food was overcooked at that point. Not sure. But I'm not convinced that this characterizes the full menu as, like I said, so many people rave about it here.

After being snubbed by a stuck up host and told we would need to wait two hours, we actually were pleasantly surprised to have been seated in about an hour. After all was said and done, it was a total letdown. Never regretted spending $150 more. Let's go through it step by step: 1. Chips and salsa - the chips were decent, you could tell they were freshly made. That's pretty much where it ends. The salsa was bland! I've made better salsa at home. 2. Guacamole - B-L-A-N-D. not a chili pepper in the whole dish. Onion was used for garnish, not flavor. We used the lime garnish off our drinks AND added salt just to make it edible. 3. Mole enchiladas - one note - sweet. No depth to the flavor, barely any spice. Any good mole is supposed to be a revolving flavor experience (sweet, spicy, creamy savory). Not this sauce. It wouldn't have surprised me if someone said it came out of a can. or jar. Not to mention - the chicken inside the enchilada was not seasoned AT ALL. It basically tasted like it had been boiled and shredded. Our local family mexican restaurant in Long Beach makes better mole. 4. Steak - ok, nothing amazing. It was cooked properly. Definitely better than the mole (although we've already established that bar was pretty low). This steak came with another salsa - tasted like it may have been a fire roasted tomato salsa. It was ok, but also bland overall. Needed some heat. The best thing on that plate was the sweet corn tamale. That  being said, it was only marginally better than the sweet corn cake you get with every meal at an El Torito in California. 5. Dessert (yes we ordered dessert - still waiting for the magic to happen) - chocolate pecan pie. Utterly forgettable. Clawingly sweet. Dry crust.  So sad to have walked away from this meal with this experience. Based on this, we would never eat at a Rick Bayless restaurant again.

I love Goose Island beer, and the flavor of this Belgian ale was the best of any of them. Give it a try because it may be hard to find anywhere else and it's actually a somewhat cheap $6.50. The food: I honestly didn't try as many dishes as I would have wanted, but I will update this review as that changes as I will definitely return. Frontera guacamole: Other reviews rave on and on about this guac. I've honestly had a lot better at several Mexican restaurants...probably would skip this next time, especially given the small portion size as well. Street food trio: I love meat, but the vegetarian avocado dish may have been the most flavorful one of the trio. Of course, the skirt steak and shredded beef were also fantastic. TINY portions. Mole trio: Great value for the $. The pork in clemole was downright amazing. Mole poblano enchiladas were also very good, and the vegetarian green peanut mole was a truly unique flavor that I enjoyed more with each bite.

Knowing that Mexican food absolutely cannot be presented well, I went with an open mind to try different things on the waiter's recommendation. Suffice it to say the food here is a disaster. It's clear that Frontera Grill is resting on its laurels rather than coming up with anything new or satisfying. Let's start with the drinks. The mojito was a mess. I ordered it with Rum, the classic way. It was way too sweet and had far too much lime, so much so that my stomach was tied up with acid after half the drink. I couldn't even finish it, and mojitos are my favorite drink. The guacamole I have to say was excellent, but the tortilla chips that came with them were stale and had an inexplicable softness to them, as if they had been sitting out way too long.  The ceviche trio was OK, but not stellar. We also had the pork Tinga, the wahoo fish of the day, and the duck. Each thing was presented slopped onto a plate with no consideration whatsoever for presentation. The duck was tasteless and over-cooked, as was the wahoo. For about $25/entree, I expect way more than that. We skipped dessert, obviously. I'm sure the margaritas may be ok, but c'mon anyone can make margaritas. The conclusion with tourist trap restaurants such as this and places like Scott Conant's Scarpetta is that these guys are lucky that they hit it big early in their careers and have TV shows now, cuz if they came out with this food now they'd be eaten alive by the competition.",0.9732,0.84,0.122,0.038,0.5370462691430434

The pork clemole was my favorite of the three - the morsels of tender pork and the sauce was packed with flavor. You can pick up the complexity of the sauce with just  one bite. The poblano enchiladas were delish as well. The meal was topped off with some Mexican hot chocolate. When my cup was near empty, the waiter was kind enough to top off my cup with coffee.

2012-07-18,5.0,"What a wonderful culinary experience. Last night, a group of us were able to make it for a late dinner. We started with their guacamole and salsa with homemade chips. The guac was tasty, but the star was definitely the salsa. They serve two varieties with the green being a tangy roasted tomatillo. For dinner, we started with their ceviche trio. All three varieties were tasty and served beautifully. For my money and if i were to do it again, I would have a full order of the Frontera ceviche as it was probably the best ceviche I've ever had. For our main dish I had the beef tacos al carbon. The meat was remarkably tender and tasty, served with soft corn tortillas and guacamole. In a way, I can't believe that I ""settled"" for fajitas, but after I put the first taco in my mouth, all doubts melted away. Our table split three desserts and they were each amazing. The Pay de Queso y Chocolate (Oaxacan cheesecake tart) was sublime. The Budin de Pan (blueberry bread pudding) was rich without being overpowering. The flan was perfect. The icecream dish was served with some type of wicked crumble that had us fighting over crumbs--literally. Desserts alone would be worth the trip and wait. And of course the drinks were phenomenal. I had the aguas frescas with a shot of something and the margarita. They were worthy of a top destination bar in terms of quality and originality. Simply amazing.

2012-07-16,5.0,"I had Frontera for dinner years ago, but when I was back this past weekend a friend suggested we try it for brunch. It didn't even occur to me to try it for brunch since I was poking around the internet for your typical Americana fare.  We actually were able to get a seat right away (around 1 on a Saturday). Perhaps with it being wedding season, Pitchfork, the Taste, summer, and a Cubs game the city had some other things happening - but there were several tables open. So that immediately was a great perk.  One of the things I wish servers did differently was not say ""well, those are two completely different things"" when you asked what is better between two. Our server didn't and actually suggested I decide based on how I wanted to feel afterwards - your typical post-Mexican full, or just something for lunch. So I appreciated it and settled on the Pozole (my other choice was enchiladas). My friend had the duck tacos. They both were great and exactly what we wanted. We had the chocolate pie for dessert and the cocktails were tasty, not super sugary with pre-mixed fillers. I felt like the price was comparable to other brunches as well. Definitely a place to try for brunch if you don't want to wait 2 hours for dinner.",0.9906,0.805,0.172,0.023,0.41259920634920627
2012-07-16,5.0,"1000th review...and it's 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOW.  Amazing We were both looking forward to this restaurant ever since we made our reservations a few months ago.  Helpful note, it is a good idea to make reservations in advanced or you will be waiting for quite a while to grab a seat. Our waiter was spot on.  He helped explain the menu to us and described the best way to possibly order menu items if you weren't wanting an entree.  This came in very handy for my girlfriend as she wasn't completely famished (thank you Lou Malnati) and was not looking for a big gut busting entree.   I had the ceviche trio and wished I had ordered them twice.  The presenation was simple but the flavors were very complex and I found something new that I enjoyed in each one.  She ordered the Fresh Corn Tamales and to quote her ""They were %!*$!% amazing!!"" :)  Being the glutton I am, I followed mine up with the Thursday night special of Chiles Rellenos.  Still drooling about these 4 days later.  Super cheesy, super amazing.  She had the Old School Frontera Trio, which was a small plate along with stealing my Herb green rice, which she was also a big fan of. My one and only complaint is the men's restroom.  It's a two seater (one stall, one urinal), and I destroyed some guy with the door when walking in.  And as fate would have it, I took the door to the face as well upon exiting.  Cut the bar in half and add some room in there please!!",0.9888,0.762,0.181,0.057,0.5534372294372294
2012-07-15,4.0,"3.5 stars rounded up to 4. I was dreaming about Frontera Grill for WEEKS leading up to my trip. I was expecting to be floored from the moment I walked in to the moment the seams of my pants burst from all the delectable offerings of Rick Bayless. The good - I don't think my vocabulary is large enough to explain how mother effing delicious the food was!!! Rick Bayless does amazing things with food. I used to think of Mexican food as an unattractive pile of mush of rice, beans, cheese and pork/chicken. But Rick Bayless takes Mexican to a new level of refinement and class. If you must order one thing at Frontera Grill, make it the pork mole. Or any other mole. The sauce is SO flavorful and has so much depth to it. I've never tasted anything like it. The bad - My boyfriend and I had 8:30 reservations but we were not seated until 8:45. Not a huge deal. I expected that from a few reviews here. We were seated and given menus. We then sat there for 15-20 minutes and no one approached us to greet us or explain the menu to us. The menu is quite overwhelming and we weren't sure how much to order. Some dishes looked like tapas while others seemed to be entrees. Service was very impersonal. When the trio (sampler) dishes were bought out, they were just placed on our table with no explanation of what was in front of us. The food was phenomenal but I was disappointed with the lack of service. The product is one thing but the service needs to be there for the whole package. I was considering giving Frontera Grill a lower rating but the food was just THAT friggin delicious that I couldn't bear to give it 3 stars...",-0.8043,0.836,0.069,0.095,0.5332031495074974

2012-07-09,5.0,"kennethtiongeats.wordpre… Brunch Menu Being located 3 blocks away from Rick Bayless's tri-conglomeration of XOCO, Frontera Grill, and Topolobampo has its perks. One thing is that good Mexican is never far away. Rick Bayless, as a primer, was studying for a PhD in linguistics at the University of Michigan, when he moved to Meixco from 1980-1986. There, he learnt Mexican cooking, and then brought it back to Chicago. When Obama was inaugurated, Rick Bayless was apparently in the running to be White House executive chef. I've been to Frontera twice now. (and XOCO 4 times). So far, I have not been disappointed. (Brunch) Chilaquiles al Guajillo (5/5) - ""Quick-simmered tortilla ""casserole"" with rustic red guajillo chile sauce, homemade crema, aged Mexican cheese (queso anejo), sunny-side up egg. Tangy baby greens."" Savory and fresh greens, great tasting sauce. Tortillas were semi-crisp - after sitting in sauce, they were a delicious mess. Duo de Flanes (4.25/5) - ""A duo of caramel custards: coconut milk-lemongrass flan with honey Manila mango salsa, plus silky Mexican vanilla. "" had a rich, sticky texture, in the region of peanut-butter stickiness. The custard cake contrasted well with the mango and wisps of coconut. (Dinner) Lamb Shoulder in Black Mole (4.5/5) - ""Grill-seared lamb shoulder braised in black mole, Nichols Farm potatoes, grilled calabacitas, anejo cheese."" Mole means sauce in Mexican. For this dish, I believe the ""mole"" here is a chocolate sauce. It was rich, and there were quite a few potatoes in the dish. It went excellently with tacos - the only minor complaint might be that the potato-lamb ratio was skewed in favour of potato. Duck ""Carnitas"" Flautas (4.5/5) - ""Crispy, crunchy taquitos of slow-cooked duck carnitas, (grilled white onions, garlic mojo). Tangy red chile escabeche, orange ""shoots salad."" Ceviche Trio - ""Frontera Ceviche (albacore, tomato, olive), Yucatecan Ceviche (shrimp, squid, orange, cucumber), Tropical Tuna Cocktail (big eye, avocado-tomatillo, mango salsa)"" Yucatan Ceviche (4.75/5) - nice and limey, good contrast with shrimp and squid Tropical Tuna Cocktail (5/5) - out of this world, perfectly salted avocado. Sweet mango complemented tuna perfectly Frontera Ceviche (4/5) - another sour one. Smoky-Creamy-Spicy Mushrooms (4.75/5) - ""Brown beech, hedgehog, oyster, shiitake & black trumpet mushrooms, white sweet potato, Oaxacan pasilla crema, epazote."" Verdict: Just go.

Stumbled in off the street on a Thursday and we were able to get three seats in the bar area within a few minutes-score, as the waits for tables were running 1.5 hours. I'd heard the hype and really wanted to experience this spot. My favorite alcohol, aside from champagne, is hands town tequila, so I really enjoyed the composed cocktails here and appreciate that they change by season. The margaritas are generally served up, which I also really liked. Stuck with a very traditional - just tequila, fresh lime, Cointreau - the only way to make a classic margarita. Absolutely perfectly executed up with a salted rim. House guacamole, salsa and extremely crispy fresh chips were excellent and the jicama snack food mixed with cukes and pineapple was delicious. Prices are very reasonable and if you are savvy, you can definitely eat (snacks at least) here as not only a vegetarian but also a vegan. Be sure to ask the very knowledgable waitstaff about details if you are a veg-eater-for example, beans that may appear veg are actually cooked in lard - just be careful. That's one of the reasons I neglected to stay for a full meal-seemed doable with some questions, modifications and perseverance, but perhaps a bit more challenging than my post-margarita (and let's be honest, champagne) self was up for. They're very hard to get, but outdoor tables are the way to go in this spot during warmer months.

Quite snottily, I might add. So, after an hour and 15 minutes, we get a call from a very nice lady that there's an open table.  Rick Bayless definitely lives up to the hype.  Ceviche trio is awesome. I know it wasn't a full order of each ceviche, but I do wish the Yucatean had more shrimp in it. Frontera ceviche sounds like an odd mix, with olives, tomato, and green chile, but it was so good. And the Tropical Tuna was great and super fresh and tasty as well.  Also delicious, were the duck carnita flautas. Crispy and saucy goodness, the meat was soft and delicious.

2012-06-05,5.0,"There's only one man in my life who could possibly threaten my relationship and that man is Rick Bayless -- a reedy bespectacled earnest-looking man with a goatee. I've been a fan of Bayless since the early 2000s when I avidly watched his cooking show on PBS that was introduced to me by my roommate of Mexican descent.  I fell in love with his dishes and his genuine enthusiasm for Mexican cuisine. With him, Mexican food became more than rice and refried beans. It was elevated to haute cuisine and celebrated the way French and Italian cuisine is celebrated in the finest restaurants in the US. A few years later, I decided to go to Chicago to visit a friend and he fulfilled my dream of dining at Frontera Grill. The food was sublime and I was eager to go back. Thanks to a conference I had a trip to Chicago planned and paid for. Naturally Frontera Grill was my first destination. We started with GUACAMOLE and freshly-made tortilla chips. The guacamole was smooth and creamy, dotted with cubed tomatoes and diced onions. But what really made this were the freshly-made tortilla chips. Warm and fresh, and deliciously salty, they elevated this to a whole new level. We thought it would be more fun to get a bunch of little appetizers to share, which turned out to be the right idea as we got to try a bunch of different things. I swear each one was a perfect little bite.  STREET FOOD TRIO: Two pieces each: potosinas (fresh cheese, avocado, crema, Tamazula), pork flautas (guajillo salsa, peashoots), sopes (shredded beef, roasted tomato, green chile).  I loved everything, but especially the sopes. The shredded beef was amazing!  MOLE POBLANO ENCHILADAs: Gunthorp free-range chicken, grill-roasted red onions.   I thought I hated mole sauce. No, it turns out that when it's made correctly, I *love* mole. There was a deep rich flavor that was accented by a hint of cacao. Other mole sauce had tasted as if people accidentally dropped a batch of chocolate into the sauce, but not at Frontera. I wanted more. TACOS AL CARBON: Wood-grilled chicken, roasted poblano rajas, guacamole, two salsas.  Yum, nothing like tacos to fill up whatever little empty corners of your stomach.  For dessert, we got DUO DE FLANES: A duo of caramel custards: classic Mexican vanilla bean & Gentle Breezes honey with Bayless Garden lemon verbena. Honey-poached apricot & honeycomb candy.  The honeycomb candy stole the show. Crispy and lightly sweet, it provided the perfect textural counterpart to the soft flan. Rick Bayless, you rock my socks. Move to NY.

I got a beer and the gf ordered their special drink, something with avocado in it, she really liked it. We waited about 20 more minutes before our table was ready. Not a big deal, it was busy as hell. We were just happy to get to our seats. Waiter was very nice, recommended some dishes. Everything we ordered was above average. But the sauce that came with the oysters...I cannot even describe how amazing that was. Not quite sure what it was...but it was mind blowingly good.

I've been wanting to try Frontera Grill the next time we were in Chicago, so we made sure it happened.  We arrived at 4pm to line up, but there was no line yet. We walked around until about 4:30 and came back and were the third party in line. By the time the doors opened a little after 5 the line was around the block, so I'd say we had pretty good timing. All the drinks we had were delicious, my favorite being the champagne margarita. It did however pack quite the punch - I don't think I would have remembered the night if I had more than one. We ordered the bacon guac, shrimp pillows, carne asada, mole trio, and flan dessert between the two of us. Everything was delicious, but the star for me were the sweet plantains with sour cream that came on the side of my carne asada - best. plantains. ever. I could have made a meal out of just this little side. Everything else was pretty perfect - great flavors and prepared perfectly. It was a solid meal, but the thing I'll really remember is the plantains.

2012-05-29,3.0,"Good food, long wait, decent service. My friends and I went to Frontera for my birthday dinner last Friday and I was mostly happy about the experience. I called a few weeks beforehand to try to make a reservation (silly me) and was told that they book 2-3 months in advance for Fridays and Saturdays. So we got in line around 5:00 PM, right before they opened. We finally got in and were quoted a 2.5 hour wait, so we went over to Paris club for a drink, and then back to Frontera to have drinks and some chips/guac (Guac was delish!).  We ended up waiting the full 2.5 hours before being seated. Sine we didn't want to eat a ton, we shared four small plates: -Halibut ceviche (on special), garnished with lime and jalepeno: really fresh, light and with a bit of a kick. Good but sort of lackluster presentation. -Classic Queso Fundito: the table's favorite. Creamy, cheesy, salty and delicious. -Mole Poblano Enchiladas: Mole sauce was amazing and not too sweet/chocolatey. -Molotes: the description made these sound tamale-like, but they ended up being these little fried pyramids. They were decent, but not our favorite. Dessert: Strawberry shortcake- fresh, in-season strawberries on the best shortcake I've ever had, garnished with edible flowers. Looked and tasted beautiful Service: not so good. Our server seemed annoyed that we only ordered small plates. Also, my friend mentioned to our server it was my birthday and she made a big stink about the fact that we ""had to order a dessert"" and that all she could do was put a candle in it. Fine. But when the dessert came, there was no candle and the server seemed to have totally forgotten about the whole thing. All in all, the food was good but I don't think I'd be willing to wait another 2.5 hours for good (not great) food and not so good service.",0.9704,0.777,0.141,0.082,0.6060685249709642

2012-05-26,3.0,"I've been here twice for dinner over the past 7 years and both times I left feeling like I had an adequate meal, but nothing special. Most recently, I came here with four other people for dinner on a Friday night. As expected, we had to wait over two hours for a table. If I have to wait that long to get a meal somewhere, I expect the meal to be better than average. Sadly, that really wasn't the case. We were seated at a good table inside--out of the main foot traffic area and not crammed up against other people. We had the bacon guacamole for an appetizer, which was superb. My only complaint about this was that the serving is pretty small. We had to order two for our table and we plowed through them both in about 5 minutes.  When the main courses were delivered to our table, mine was missing. The waitress came over and said, ""I heard something was missing. What is it?"" I told her and then she ran off, presumably to the kitchen. Time went on and some other woman arrived (a manager I guess) who explained that the waitress had forgotten to put the order in, but that she's not normally that forgetful. My meal arrived shortly thereafter, but the waitress never actually apologized and there was no compensation for the mistake either. Mistakes happen, but honestly, for a restaurant of this caliber, they really should have handled this mishap better.  To top it off, my main course of chicken breast with green mole of poblanos, pumpkin seeds, squash blossoms, chayote & cream was kind of subpar. The mole was not that great and the herb-infused green corn torta that came with the meal had a very bizarre flavor. The chicken was good, however. The size of the meal was also pretty small. Some of the other entrees at our table were much larger. I skipped dessert but other people at our table had the strawberry shortcake and the chocolate pecan pie. I had a bite of the pie and it was delicious. Another negative was the bathroom. The women's room has two stalls and one sink, which is ridiculously tiny given the size of this place and the number of people hanging out at the bar. It was not particularly late in the evening when I went in there, but the bathroom was pretty trashed. There were paper towels strewn all over the place and there were none left to use. Again, for a restaurant of this caliber, they should be a bit more on top of things like this. In short, the food is ok, but this place does not live up to the hype and I would not wait two hours to eat here again.",0.949,0.794,0.119,0.087,0.49585796387520525

I am going to start off by saying that while the guacomole is good, you'll want to order more than one if your party has more than three people in it.  My husband and I prefer my guacamole, but it was really good.  I really liked the salsas.  The one with habenero in it (sorry, can't remember the name and they changed the menu since we were there!) was extraordinary. You must get the Topolobampo tortilla soup.  It is the only dish always on the menu, and there is a reason.  It is the best tortilla soup I have ever had.  It may even be the best soup I have ever had.  The broth is deliciously complex; the chicken was perfectly cooked; it was just cheesy enough.  Fantastic.  We had five in our party, and we got a lot of variety to share around.  One of us was vegan, and he was pleased with the selection and the execution.  I tried the fresh corn tamales, which were a little disappointing, as were the sweet potatoes (WAY too sweet and way too much bacon).  The Carne Asade is a really good choice.  I loved the sweet fried plaintains and smoky black beans.  Anything with beef is going to be good, but if plaintains and black beans are not part of your meal, consider getting them on the side.   Bayless is known for his sauces, particularly mole, so you can't go wrong there, either.  The trios are a really good way to try a wide variety of dishes, but the portions are small, so you could share around as an appetizer or order a few sides or a salad to make a meal.  My friend got a streetfood one, which isn't currently on the menu, and enjoyed it, but it was too small for her to share with everyone. The desserts are great, too.  Sopa de Frutas is always good, and the fruit changes with the season (it was citrus when we were there).  We also had the Tres Leches de Coco.  It sounds totally weird: cake, chocolate, and mango, but it is AMAZING.  The hot chocolate and coffee were great, too.",0.9992,0.719,0.268,0.013,0.6239583333333333

So after living in Chicago for quite awhile my boyfriend and I, along with another couple, finally decided to head over on a Thursday night.  We were all extremely underwhelmed and disappointed. The food was mediocre at best, the portions are laughable, and the service was not up to par for a meal that cost the amount of money we spent.  The salsa is a joke. I thought we would be given enough for the entire table or atleast enough for one person. The salsa was served in two small plates and the serving size was about a tablespoon of each salsa. It was ridiculous. Not to mention they gave us barely any chips. I guess you don't need that many when the salsa portion is barely a spoonful.  I ordered fish in Yucatecan Escabeche. It was tasteless and unseasoned. I also ordered the Traditional black beans. They tasted like they came straight out of a can and/ or sat under a heat lamp for way too long. At the beginning of our meal our waiter was noticeably getting mad because we were not ready to order after he had come by twice. We were just talking and catching up we didn't realize as soon as we sat down we were going to be rushed through our meal. It was really rude. He also was not happy when we did not decide to get dessert. It was a little inappropriate. Everyone else was just as disappointed as I was. We were just expecting more from such a well-known and raved-about restaurant from a celebrity chef.  There are a lot of drink choices.

Everyone at the table said the drinks were fantastic.  There was a variety of Topolo Margaritas and Mexican Mojitos.  My only complaint - being pregnant I asked if they could make a virgin drink and the server pointed me to the soda section.  I was a little let down with my selection, some sort of homemade soda that was quite sweet.   Overall, we loved this restaurant and cannot wait to go back!!!",0.9984,0.741,0.243,0.016,0.5354139854139854

Entrees- Mole Trio- I love moles, and being able to try three at once was awesome. The current offering was a mole poblano enchilada, the pork coloradita, and roasted vegetables in green mole. The coloradita and the mole poblano were the best of the three.  Our server Charles was great all night!

It was crazy that people had to line up before it opened for dinner.  The dining area wasn't big at all.  If your place in line was at the entrance of Xoco, you probably would not be in the first round.  Just to give you an idea, I had lined up 15 minutes before it opened on a Friday evening, and the group of 4 before me was told a 2 hour wait. Their drinks were really good.  Torn among the different choices, I chose Blood Orange Margarita from the seasonal menu and Champagne Margarita from the classic menu.  Bubbly margarita was good, not outstanding, but blood orange with Jamaican sugar on the rim was perfectly balanced between sweet and sour.   The Mole Trio was more like a sampler rather than different flavors complementing each other.  Two of the three moles were either too salty or too vinegary.  The only one mole that I had enjoyed was the roasted veggie with pumpkin seeds.  It was rich, earthy and aromatic--ummm I could still remember the taste a month later.

Compared to other restaurants of celebrity chefs, it lacked that ""wow"" factor. We dove right in to start with a Beef-and-Poblano Tamal (rather than paying $10 for guacamole, I don't care how good it is). The beef was cooked splendidly but the flavour was a little acidic and I was hoping for more heat. We followed that with Yucatecan Ceviche, which I would say was a highlight. Again, a lot of acidity but this time it worked perfectly. For entrees, we split Duck with Pasilla-Huitlacoche Sauce and Pork in Manchamanteles. While the mole had a rich flavour, the sauce on the duck was salty and overpowering and again, the acidity did not work well with my palate.

There were definitely some new Mexican flavors that I hadn't ever experienced before in the dishes here, that much I appreciated about the food.  In terms of overall satisfaction however I wasn't any more satisfied than when I leave a local taqueria that charges one third of the price for twice the amount of Mexican food.  I was generally satisfied with my entree overall but I just don't think the price tag ($21) was justified. Wasn't very full and had a sweet tooth hankering so I went for the pastel de chocolate y cacahuate.  This featured a very rich and dense, yet velvety, chocolate peanut butter cake, toasted peanut ice cream and diced mango.  This was probably my favorite part of my meal here. Their homemade hot sauce placed at every table is not very hot at all, it's really more tangy than anything else.  A little disappointing since I like the heat.

Manhattans in Chicago? The Manhattans in Chicago are made with Templeton Rye, Al Capone's whiskey of choice. It's a 100% gangsta choice of a cocktail and very much Chicago. Make no mistake and it goes down smooth. The menu at Frontera Grill recently changed and has more small plates now made for sampling and sharing. This was perfect as we had pre-eaten at Xoco while we were passing the 1 and a half hour wait.  Everything we had was fantastic. I'd definitely return to try more things.

We tried the Beef-and-Poblano Tamal, Mole Trio, and Fresh Corn Tamales. It was a nice balance of dishes as we had some sour flavors as well as savory and sweet. I was most impressed with the trio of moles as it had the most common one I was familiar with (dark sauce) and a new one I found quite tasty and a nice alternative to all things heavy with meat: the epazote (roasted vegetables in pumpkinseed mole). Frontera Grill is a large restaurant with a large crowd and long wait. Even at 9 PM at night expect to sit down around 11 PM. It's all worth it, just make sure you get your churros next door at Xoco. The two sort of go hand in hand for the total Bayless experience.",0.9897,0.829,0.15,0.021,0.5185361454263893

Fresh, succulent ... my mouth is watering just thinking about this stuff. I also had the tortilla soup, my friend had the pork entree (the mashed potatoes that accompanied it were sweet potatoes somehow INFUSED WITH BACON).  We also had the champagne margaritas, which is exactly as dangerous as it sounds. Imagine the bubbles of champagne mixed in deadly combination with the punch of tequila.  OK I must stop writing now, I am drooling too much to look normal at work.",0.8591,0.778,0.154,0.068,0.50625
2012-04-24,4.0,"I think I expected too much. I'm not going to lie, I'd been looking forward to going to Frontera Grill for something like two years, since I first went to Xoco. And I should have known better than to get too excited about anywhere with this much hype. I must say, that's probably why I wasn't overwhelmed; my expectations were simply set too high.  First off, the food. Frontera has just put out a new menu, centered on shared food, tapas-style eating. With our group of three, that sounded good, and we followed our waiters' directions in ordering about 2 items per person. And we were drowning in food. It was mostly delicious, but things like the sweet potatoes with bacon weren't really worth it. The duck flautas were probably my favorite item, rich and delicately spicy. The shredded beef enchiladas were also good, but not fantastically so. The mole we tried was also excellent. But again, just not the world-changing experience that, say, the goat barbacoa torta at Xoco was. We even tried the goat barbacoa queso fundido, but the queso totally overwhelmed, and I felt like it was a little overwhelming. Perhaps that was the problem: everything was just a tad too much, trying a little too hard. That's not to say it wasn't bloody delicious, and I didn't eat a lot of it. It just wasn't the life altering moment that I wanted it to be. And yes, it does have genuine Mexican flavors and spices, in a way that most traditional Americanized Mexican food in the U.S. does not.  Secondly, the drinks. We had a blood orange margarita that was pretty phenomenal, and then switched to beer. The drinks are delicious and reasonably priced. It was the first time I've had a margarita that didn't seem to involve any mixes, and that made me happy. Thirdly, the service. Our waiter was totally charming. And though he might have told us to order more food than we could possibly eat, he was considerate, answered all questions, and obviously really enjoys his job.  As for the wait, we were going on Friday night. We stopped in to put our name on the list at about 6 PM, and were told it would be 2 hours. We had planned ahead and expected that kind of wait, so it was no big deal. When we stopped back by at 7 PM just to check in, following a drink at a nearby spot, they were ready for us. It was pretty well-timed, and the fact that we didn't have to wait in the restaurant the whole time was definitely appreciated. The atmosphere is a little hectic, and one doesn't exactly feel like sitting and hanging out would be appreciated. And while that is fine at Xoco, where street food and a bit of a rush feel naturally coordinated and hand-in-hand, that's a little more bothersome at Frontera, when you're dropping considerably more cash and might appreciate a little bit of a relaxed tone.  All in all, it was definitely worth experiencing Frontera once. I'm just not all that sure I'd do it again.",0.9986,0.757,0.201,0.042,0.5184725604256853

The drinks were delish, the service was great and the food was even better!  My guy and I are Rick Bayless fans (watched his shows, have his books even had the pleasure of seeing him in our hometown during a Macy's cooking demonstration) so we had to eat at his restaurant of course during our trip to Chicago. We know great Mexican food because we live in San Diego, we were pleasantly surprised with our meal at Frontera though!  We enjoyed: Frontera Guacamole; Street Food Trio: Two pieces each: potosinas (fresh cheese, avocado, crema, Tamazula), duck flautas (tomato-cascabel sauce, arugula salad), sopes (shredded beef, roasted tomato, green chile); Carne Asada ""Brava"" : Serrano-marinated, grass-fed Tall Grass flank steak, salsa huevona (hand-crushed, grill-roasted tomatoes, jalapeños). Grilled knob onions and sweet corn tamales with crema & fresh cheese; Fried Plantains: Homemade sour cream, fresh cheese & Shredded Beef Enchiladas: Chile-spiked shredded beef, roasted tomato sauce & Samuel's cheese. Crispy onions, cilantro; Rhubarb-Cassis Margarita. Our drinks were: Cazadores blanco tequila, Torres orange, Creme de Cassis, rhubarb, fresh lime, jamaica sugar &  Cascabel Margarita: Espolon blanco tequila, Orange Curacao, fresh-made lemonada, homemade lime bitters, Cascabel salt; We finished the meal by sharing the Frontera's Chocolate Pecan Pie: with Kahlua whipped cream!  All so very yummy I know it sounds like alot of food but we shared and the portions are small to moderate so we took a nice trip around the menu with great suggestions from our friendly server. I would never think I'd pay so much for Mexican food but I have to say it was our favorite Chicago meal and worth the price! Thanks Frontera!!",0.9944,0.799,0.192,0.009,0.5288177339901478

When we arrived before opening time there was already a line of people waiting outside. So be sure to get there early to cut down on the wait time! Food was all excellent as all previous reviewer had mention.  We got all the recommended items like Trio Ceviche, Mole, Duck, Sopes, Duo Flan of course guacamole and chips!  We were very wow'd by the level of favors and intensity in each dish, from deep and rich, to light and just right. The Flan was one of the best I had.

2012-04-21,4.0,"Rick Bayless has to be one of the godfathers of Mexican food in America!  Which seems odd for a guy from Oklahoma, but hey, whatever works.  Frontera is the casual side of his restaurant in Chicago (next door to the high end Topolobampo).  We had had a truly phenomenal meal at his LA outpost, Red O, so we figured we would give the Chicago branch a try, and it did not disappoint! We started our evening with the Topolo margarita for me and champagne margarita for the Mrs.  Both were nicely prepared and definitely different from your generic lime-infused margarita you find in most Mexican joints. For dinner, we had a range of the appetizers and street food, including: The Hurrache, which may have been the highlight of the whole meal, a thick and crunchy hand made masa cake grilled to get smoky bits on it, then covered with shredded carne asada, grilled vegetables, greens and cheese - imagine a tostada on steroids and you have a very faint idea of how good this dish was! Goat Barbacoa Queso Fundido (don't go yech!) - one of the most unusual and tasty queso renditions we have had, with the usual chorizo replaced by a savory goat and tomato stew with onions and peppers, MMMM! Ceviche Trio - three very unique interpretations of this classic, including a tuna, mango and avacado mix that reminded us of Hawaiian poke, a shellfish and cucumber version, and an albacore and tomato version - all tasty and refreshing! There were probably 20 other dishes on the menu we could have eaten, and given how well the food we did eat was executed, I'm sure the others would have been equally excellent.  Guess we'll have to come back on our next visit to the Windy City. Atmosphere is nothing special here - certainly a far cry from the hip buzz of Red O.  Topolobambo may be different (we didn't go in), but I'd recommend this spot for the food more than the atmosphere.",0.9895,0.836,0.132,0.031,0.4869890873015873

While we waited, we enjoyed Blood Orange Margaritas and Guacamole in the bar.  The Margaritas ran a little sweeter than you'd anticipate for a drink that features Blood Orange but, we didn't let that deter us from finishing and enjoying them.  The Guacamole was smooth and velvety with a really nice blend of flavors and served in a mortar on a banana leaf.  Somehow, we knew we'd survive the wait for our table as long as we had supplies of Margaritas and Guacamole.  And survive we did. Eventually we were seated and prepared to dig in.  The short rib special was sold out (a good sign in my book) and we both settled on the Puerco en Manchamanteles.  Let me be clear, here: there was no settling.  This was spectacular.  With 3 kinds of pork product on my plate, I was like a kid in a candy store.  The pork loin was cooked to perfection such that you didn't need a knife.  It was with pineapple and chipotle and homemade chorizo.  The flavors counter each other beautifully and were tied together with an almond-ancho mole.  Beneath the pork was kale that was akin to a collard green preparation.  As the ingredients fell together on the plate, the flavors mixed and their contrasts were only heightened.  On the other side of the plate was butternut squash treated with ancho and brimming with bacon.  What was not to love? I decided that I hadn't had quite enough to drink and tried the Homemade Gin and Tonic.  It might have been the best Gin and Tonic I've ever had.  Get it.  Drink it.  You're welcome. We opted for dessert, the Pastel de Chocolate y Cacahuate.  Chocolate-peanut butter cake that was almost molten, topped with ancho-candied peanuts and served with peanut ice cream on the side.  They were kind enough to observe a mango allergy at the table and exclude the tequila-spiked honey Manila mango .  This was dessert as it was meant to be.   If you're able to make reservations, by all means, get on it.  Otherwise, steel yourself, get a drink and some guac and bide your time.  It will be well worth the wait.",0.9943,0.831,0.145,0.024,0.551825396825397

Our server's name was Pancho, and he was wonderful.  His warm demeanor and obvious pride in the place made him a delight, and made it very easy for T., the eldest's girlfriend, to ask him questions about the menu.  He suggested we start with the Sopes Rancheros, and T. also chose the Queso Fundido de Borrego.  Both of these dishes were so complex and tasty, we ended up sad that they were only appetizers, we could have easily eaten more of those. My Blood Orange Margarita was a sweet and refreshing delight, and I found my husband's CBG interesting and tasty. A. and T. had Scarlet Waves, which were fruity and delicious, and E.'s Limeade was tart and crisp. A., E., and I all had Tacos al Carbon - A. had the duck, I had the pork, and E. had the beef, and we all passed bites around.  The duck was so tender and juicy, I was ready to hop over the table and steal my son's dinner.  My pork was perfectly seasoned, moist, and delicious.  E. was very pleased with his tender, melt-in-your-mouth beef, gorgeous and a little sweet.  Pancho was very observant, and kept bringing fresh tortillas unbidden.  We appreciated his careful attention. T. chose the Enchiladas de Norteños, stuffed with zesty shredded beef, covered with a rich sauce, creamy cheese, and garnished with onion straws.  It was a little spicier than what she usually eats, but she tucked in with gusto, exclaiming gleefully with every bite. My husband had the Pollo al Cascabel, and was blown away.  The chicken was tender and succulent, and paired incredibly well with the hazelnut sauce.  Seriously, hazelnuts and chicken?  Wonderful together. In spite of being stuffed to the gills, we did have dessert:  Pastel de Chocolate y Cacahuate for A. and T.; Capirotada de Pascua for hubby and me; Duo de Flanes for E.  I also had a cup of Cafe de Olla - sweet and fruity, with no need for additional sugar, and no need for milk at all.  We passed the desserts around the table, and marveled at the richness and complexity of all of them. It was T.'s very first visit to Chicago ever, and adding a visit to Frontera made it even more exciting.  You WILL wait to be seated, and if you're foolish enough to show up after the first seating has begun, you will wait A LONG TIME.  Patience will pay off, however, with some of the best Mexican food you're ever likely to find this far removed from Mexico.",0.9988,0.745,0.211,0.044,0.605128205128205

THE SOPES RANCHEROS: corn shells with pork, numerous fixings, and ranchero sauce. Melded together awesomely. One of my faves, at a good price. THE PATO EN MOLE DE PINON: duck with mole sauce. The mole here tastes very earthy and complex. Not exactly my taste but it was interesting. The duck was a bit dry. We drenched it in the mole sauce. Our least favorite dish. THE TACOS AL CARBON: the carne asadas was cooked perfectly medium rare, and the flour tortillas were AMAZEBALLS. I'm salivating just remembering it right now. So, so good. I was sad I only got to eat two. Favorite! THE DUO DE FLANES: one coconut flan and one classic  vanilla flan for dessert (like we needed to eat more by that time). Pretty good.

2012-03-23,4.0,"Checked out this restaurant for the first time last week--as it was recognized as my boss' ""favorite restaurant in Chicago."" I had always steered clear of the place even though it's 4 blocks away from my apartment because it doesn't take reservations (so annoying!)  Props to Rick Bayless though--I was incredibly impressed and have now decided this is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Chicago. That being said, the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is as follows: 1) Not only are advance reservation not allowed, but they over-quote their wait time. I went again last night and the same thing occurred as the first night. I put my name in at 6pm. Was told 1.5-2 hours for a table (when there were literally only 4 other names ahead of me on their waiting list). Ran home and changed out of my work clothes. Was called by the hostess and told ""two last minute cancellations had occurred and I could be seated now"" after a whopping 30 minutes had passed. Amazing how that works. 2) Hands-down the single best, most impressive, and delicious dish on the menu are the Chiles Rellenos: Classic, souffle-battered stuffed poblanos (one cheese, one minced-pork picadillo) with roasted tomato-chile sauce; black beans & Mexican rice. --Small problem--the restaurant ONLY serves them on Thursdays and they ONLY make 20 portions of this dish (or a total of 40 stuffed peppers) on the Thursdays they are served. What. The. Heck. So irritating.  So, my words of advice are: This Thursday evening--swing by Frontera Grill at 5pm. Expect them to tell you you won't be seated until 7pm but immediately reserve (yes, you have to place a reservation for a table AND this dish) your order of Chiles Rellenos. Grab a marg at the bar. And you'll have your amazing dish within 30 minutes. That all being said, also make SURE you get a fresh ceviche and an order of their chips and guac. *heaven* And if you're not a marg person--their mojitos are insanely good too. The steak tacos specialty plate (Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena) was also out of this world. Didn't much care for the Pescado a la Campechana dish though.

One traditional, one more experimental. Both beyond any flan's I've ever had. Even the coffee selection is tough as they have unique types made just for the restaurant. BUT most importantly our service was OUTSTANDING. Our server's name was Maria and she walked us through the menu and her favorites and never lead us astray.

2012-02-23,1.0,"Hands down the most disappointing meal I have ever had. This place is the pf changs of mexican food. Came here a few months ago after hearing how great it was (Rick Bayless did win Top Chef Masters, as I was told), and since I was feeling homesick (I'm from Austin, tx) and really really wanted some good mexican food, decided to give it a shot. I came here with two friends and we were all less than satisfied upon leaving. Their margaritas were pretty good, I will give them that. Anyways, we ordered the appetizer sampler which came with guac, empanadas, jicama, and some other unmemorable things. It was alright, but not great, the empanadas tasted one step better than stuff from the freezer section of the grocery store. The real disaster came when I got my entree, the mole duck breast with corn fritters. When it came out everything just looked limp and sad (I questioned whether it had been sitting under a heat lamp). I had a bite or two and it was not good. The texture of the duck was meh, the mole was too too sweet, with no flavor, and the fritters were soggy. I was willing to give it a few more bites before giving it it axe, but at the next one, I chewed into something that had the texture of what I can best describe as a thin rubberband so I spit it out. Upon inspection of all the other slices, I noticed this thick white ribbon going through all of them (what I assume was just really thick silverskin) so when the waitress came back, I told her about it and she took by plate away and didn't charge me for it (which was very nice, I will give them that as well). Any legitimate restaurant should know to remove silverskin from meat before cooking. Even though she took the duck off our check, we still ended up paying about $200 between the three of us in the end. There are much better mexican places around town at cheaper prices. I'm hoping that the reason it was so disappointing is that Rick Bayless is doing so many other things that he doesn't have time to check the quality of all his restaurants regularly and not that he doesn't know how to make mexican food worth shit.",0.9813,0.791,0.139,0.07,0.43766996891996895

The pork and the sauce overpowered the tamal. I would probably not order this one again.  For entrees, I had the Pescado en Pipian de Almendra. Cobia in a green sauce with almonds and polenta cakes. Good, flaky. My wife went with the pork loin with butternut mash. This was the clear favorite. The red mole was ridiculous and the candied pecans put it over the top.

You don't need me to tell you that Frontera is amazing; there are 912 other reviews to attest to that. Adding mine would be a redundancy on par with pointing out that Newt Gingrich is pond scum.  Of course we had to stop by Frontera on our visit to Chicago. It was a cold windy night, and we ordered a large, homey meal to compensate: lamb cazuela (Borrego Al Cascabel), duck pumpkin mole (Pato en Mole de Calabaza), flank steak (Falda Asada ""Brava""), and vanilla ice cream for dessert. We didn't count on the hefty portion size of the cazuela. A single-size cast iron skillet mounding over with sexy lamb bits + fluffy homemade corn tortillas = a) a filling meal all on its own and b) too tantalizing NOT to finish. Fully aware of the consequences ahead (i.e., pending entrees), we exchanged steely, determined eyes across the table, fortified our resolve, girded our stomachs, and forged bravely onward--slopping through the sauce to the very bottom of that pit of deliciousness. One whiff of the entrees, and I knew I was in trouble. The sumptuous wafts simultaneously set me off salivating at an uncomfortable rate, while reminding me that the little room left in my stomach had just been filled by aromas. Uf!  Barely making headway into the duck and steak (both delicious, get them!), I had a gut-wrenching (literally) decision to make.

2012-01-29,5.0,"On my last visit to Chicago I had time for once nice dinner. Where to go?  i could visit old standbys, or try something new. I almost gave up on trying to go to Frontera Grill as I wasn't able to get a reservation - but my dining companion was game for a long wait and we figured there were plenty of other nearby options if we were thwarted in our quest. Frontera Grill it was, and what a wonderful decision.  The food is glorious. Absolutely everything we ate was impeccable and bright and flavorful. We started with the guacamole. The guacamole is good ... of course the guacamole is good. But want to know what's better? The tomatillo salsa. I know, you're thinking, salsa? Seriously? You go out for high-end Mexican food and you want to talk about salsa? LET ME TELL YOU 'BOUT THIS SALSA. It has this crazy depth of flavor that will leave you neglecting your awesomely delicious guacamole so that you can sit and ponder what has gone into it. (Later, your waiter will be happy to tell you. But give up because you'll never manage to recreate it at home, you'll just have to move to Chicago.) It managed to outshine our second appetizer, a deliciously light jicama salad that I would have considered a triumph at any other meal. Alas, at this table, it became only an afterthought! (A delicious afterthought, though, you should totally order it.) For my entree I had the carne asada. It was served with sweet plantains, guacamole, and black beans. I learned something from this entree: I like black beans! I have never in my life enjoyed them, but after being happy with everything I'd eaten so far in my meal I decided to be brave and try them. Et voila! A new food I like to add to my repertoire. Thanks, Rick Bayless, for changing my mind about beans. Everything else on the plate was delicious and my steak was a perfect medium-rare - impressive since it was a fairly thin cut of beef. My dining companion was a vegetarian and while the options available to her were somewhat limited, she was very happy with her tacos with mushrooms. Our waiter noted her choice of entree and asked if she was vegetarian, he noted that the beans are cooked in pork and was quick to offer up alternatives. We both finished up our meal with a dessert of a duo of flans - while I am usually a fan of chocolate, the vanilla flan totally stole the show. By the time we left you could have rolled us home, but we wouldn't have missed a bite of it.  Service was great. Our waiter was incredibly attentive even though he waTs also taking care of a table of 10 seated next to us. I was very impressed by the attentiveness of everyone, from the hostess to the manager in the dining room (who noticed my half-empty waterglass from across the room and had someone en route to replenish before I'd even gotten the glass down). And to top it all off? Rick Bayless was IN THE KITCHEN! With a chef of his fame and caliber I never expect that they've actually had a hand in making my food happen, but it appears that on this night I was wrong! It was lots of fun to get to see him sit down at the chef's counter and look over his kitchen.

2012-01-22,4.0,"I sure liked Frontera Grill a lot more than I did its swank attack L.A. cousin, Red O.  I came for lunch on Friday with Michael K., walking over from Janice K.'s apartment in a snowstorm.  We were welcomed by a warm and festive restaurant, decked out in colorful Mexican art-themed decor.  We didn't have reservations, but after we checked our coats, we were seated right away. We were served by a young woman, and I wish I'd gotten her name because she was fantastic.  She looked like she could be a disaffected post-teen, but she was actually very competent and friendly.  The meal ran smoothly with her at the helm.  Towards the end of our lunch, we caught a glimpse of Rick Bayless running around the kitchen.  Unexpected, actually, and very cool. We kicked off our meal with a couple delicious margaritas, one traditional and one with a twist.  The Topolo Margarita was the classic, with Sauza Conmemorativo tequila, Torres orange liqueur, and housemade limonada, rimmed in salt at our option and shaken tableside.  It was splendid, well liquored and very smooth, with a citrus juiciness that kept it appropriate for lunch.  The Tamarind Margarita was also delightful, made with Wahaka Joven Espadin mezcal instead of tequila, along with Cointreau, fresh tamarind, fresh lime, and a bit of chipotle.  It was less bright than the Topolo, but I loved the smokey mezcal, the flavorful but not quite sweet fruit of the tamarind, and of course, the meaty chipotle salt rim. The best part of the meal came first, in the form of a ceviche trio (or Trio, Trio, Trio, if you're reading along with the menu for some weird reason).  This brought a beautiful presentation of Coctel de Atun Tropical, Ceviche Fronterizo, and Ceviche Yucateco in three little cocktail glasses, side by side, with crispy tortilla chips strewn at their base.  All three were spectacular.  The tuna cocktail came with sashimi-grade Hawaiian yellowfin tuna with an avocado tomatillo guacamole and a tangy mango grapefruit salsa.  The tuna was silky and fresh, and the salsa and smooth guacamole provided a lovely base.  My favorite ceviche, as well as the high point of the meal, was the Ceviche Fronterizo with lime-marinated Hawaiian albacore with tomatoes, olives, cilantro, jicama, and green chile.  This was vivid and refreshing, with bright tangy flavors and a nice textural contrast between the tender sashimi albacore and the crunchy jicama.  The Ceviche Yucateco was great, too, with steamed Mexican blue shrimp, calamari, lime, orange, habanero, avocado, jicama, and cilantro.  The shrimp and calamari were fresh and supple, and I enjoyed the heat and citrus in the mix.  Alongside our ceviches, we also shared a tamal de puerco.  This was another highlight of the meal.  The tamal consisted of bacon-studded corn masa filled with smoked pork, all steamed in a banana leaf and served with a grilled frisee salad, a pineapple morita salsa, and a rich dark red chile adobo sauce.  The corn was not quite sweet with a delightful grain, and the pork was moist and tender.  The frisee made the dish feel less sinful, and I loved the way the sweet pineapple interacted with the layered heat of the adobo sauce.  I actually preferred that red sauce to the mole poblano, though that was also quite good. For our larger dishes, we went for the enchiladas de mole poblano and the carne asada a la Oaxaqueña.  The enchiladas were quite good, homemade tortillas stuffed with moist shreds of free-range chicken, all doused in a dark brown mole, served with creamy black beans.  The tortillas were nice, softened but not soaked, and I did like the dark sauce, but it was overwhelmingly salty.  It still tasted good, but each bite introduced a long parch to my mouth after the swallow.  The carne asada was good, but the least memorable dish of the meal.  We got the rib steak cooked medium rare, and it came very tender, bright pink but not too chewy.  The meat was marinated in spicy red chile then wood-grilled, and it had nice flavor.  It came with black beens, sweet plantains, sour cream, and guacamole, and we also got fresh tortillas and two salsas to make tacos.  These tacos were great.  I especially liked the cilantro heavy green salsa, and the plantains were excellent. We saved just enough room for what we hoped would be a bright, light dessert.  We ordered the sopa de frutas - avocado lime sorbet with blood oranges and tangerines, floating in a sparkling pomegranate broth - and it bombed.  The sorbet was weird and not refreshing.  It was okay flavor-wise, but the texture was weird and gummy, especially when it met the pomegranate soda water.  The fruit was fresh and lightly bitter, but none of the flavors really came together.  This was a disappointment. Still, we left Frontera happy customers and spent the better part of the afternoon walking off our lunch.  We'd decided beforehand to try both Frontera and Topolobampo, and the first meal left me excited for the second.  Hasta la vista, Sr. Bayless.",0.9996,0.748,0.213,0.039,0.588925028344671

The only thing that was missing was an amazing dinner and we got it at Frontera Grill.  After taking some advice from the fab Deb E...we arrived at FG around 4:45. Boy was I glad we did. A lined had formed and we were one of the last ones to get into the line that was INSIDE the restaurant. If we had waited any longer...we would have had to stand outside in the cold. Moments later, a nice young man came around and took our names and offered us our choice of times & dining - bar area or main dining. We opted for the bar...b/c we were starving and wanted to get seated sooner.  We grabbed a couple of cocktails - the flor martini - organic vodka, St. Germaine and fresh grapefruit juice. It was refreshing and more importantly - strong. We didn't hold back and ordered plenty of offerings - crab claws, a tamal, chips, ceviche and a pork dish. Everything was amazing and beautifully presented. The crab claws were delicious and the accompaniments were perfect. The tamal de puerco was so flipping tasty. Bacon corn masa filled with pork, red chile sauce and a pineapple mojito salsa. I wish I had one right now. My friend's ceviche was SO good as was the escabeche.  I ordered up the Puerco en Clemole Castellano - roasted pork loin served with butternut squash mash, greens with candied chile spiced pecans & bacon, and nutty smokey mole sauce. Divine. The homemade tortillas are heaven and I might have used one or two to sop up that mole sauce. I also could not resist the Topolo margarita which I would gladly drink by the pitcher. We were so stuffed that dessert could not be had, maybe next time.  The meal was perfect. The timing was perfect. Our bellies were full and I was feeling the buzz as we settled in to enjoy the rest of our evening. It was a memorable meal and one I'd love to experience again in the future.",0.9973,0.788,0.194,0.018,0.63497425997426
2012-01-20,5.0,"Def in my top 5 fav restaurants in Chicago. 1. Getting a reservation:what a lot of ppl don't know is that they do take reservations! Just have to make them a good 3-4 weeks in advance. I've had Rez probably 9 of the 10 times I've been here. Otherwise eat a light lunch and go for the open bar seating at 5/5:30 2. Ambience is creative, tasteful, and keeps in line w e Mexican theme.  3. FOOD: everything is amazing! Where to start??   Apps:  Guac is amazing, love the Flautas de pato, the tamales r better than the ones I ate off the street in Mexico city (no joke)...all the flavors are always perfectly balanced! Salad/Soup: have no idea because why waste the space in your stomach?! Entrees: they rotate seasonally, some of my last favorites were the camarones with tomatillo arroz and the slow cooked pork. Current fav is the golden tile with pipian de almendra. The fish was wood grilled to perfection-could taste the smokiness, and it was perfectly complemented by that Pipian! Dessert: YOU MUST GET THE BUÑUELOS DE VIENTO aka ""donuts of wind"" they are light and perfect with a blood orange purée...AMAZING!!

I'm Mexican and I'm very hard to impress with 'authentic' Mexican food so my expectations were quite high. We got lucky and made a reservation for the next day at 1 PM and we were seated right away. The decor was very funky with bright colors and huge paintings depicting Mexican culture.  We ordered the ceviche trio - absolutely amazing! Margaritas and mojitos were strong and yummy! My boyfriend had never tried mole so I knew I had to have him try the Mole Enchiladas - they were amazing! We both love spicy food and this mole definitely made us sweat! Truly delicious. I ordered the fish with green mole and it was perfectly cooked. Honestly, can't complain about the food! I wish we had tried their Tres Leches cake but we were completely stuffed.  The service was also very attentive and professional. I knew he would appreciate me speaking to him in Spanish but out of respect for my boyfriend he also repeated everything in English just to make sure everyone understood.

I was very happy with my meal, which was Puerco al Albanil. The brothy sauce of serrano chiles, caramelized onions, sun-dried tomatoes, bacon was delicious and the meat was tender. I almost wished there was more sauce. Our waiter was a little slow to take our orders but seemed very knowledgable. Possible highlight of the meal was when we were waiting for our coats from the coat check.

Once we were seated, we immediately placed an order for - what else? - guacamole.  Wow - I loves me some guac and I'm kind of a snob about it, but this is fantastic.  We followed it up with a ceviche trio, which was fresh and delicious.  I ordered a glass of sangria (unbelievably good) to enjoy with my duck tacos, which could not have been more perfectly cooked and were wonderfully flavorful.  Solid meal all around. Note on the service: the bartenders were very meh.  After being forced to move to a different side of the bar after basically being shoulder-checked by a creepy guy who was trying to hit on two very drunk girls, the other bartender seemed less than thrilled to take our order for our second round, even suggesting that I walk back to the other side to talk to the original bartender.  Our server Maria, however, was absolutely fantastic.  She was friendly, attentive, and knew the menu cold.",0.9936,0.753,0.184,0.063,0.5851587301587301

Getting to the point, Frontera is a must try for anyone who even likes chips and salsa... The decor is fun and vibrant, service is adequate and casual, but the food and drink speak volumes about his deep passion for the cusine and culture of Mexico.  His food is almost as colorful as the decor. The Ceviche trio is a must for anyone who enjoys that refreshing and energizing feelin a good ceviche can provide. You truly cant go wrong with any Margarita, served straight up, so you know the bartender/mixologist knows what they're doing. Any entree you order will be solid. If it's on his menu, you wont be dissapointed.  No sense in writing on. Mexican chef's (from Mexico), are inspired by all the creativty and ingenuity Rick has influence in Mexican cusine.

I do respect what Rick Bayliss can do with a chili, and the presentation and flavors in my dish were very enjoyable.  Perhaps I need to go back and sample a wider variety of items to see if my opinion changes.

However, the rest of the food was good, but not great as I expected. My boyfriend had the duck tacos and greatly enjoyed them and my toquitos were decent. The smokey taste in the toquitos was so intense that I didn't enjoy them as much as I thought I would. The salsa is fantastic and so is the mexican water drink that is made each day. I would highly recommend trying that. This is a good restaurant,but for the price, I wouldn't highly recommend it. There are equally good mexican restaurants in Chicago for a fraction of the price.

While I expected the appetizers to be more of small tastings, they were definitely well-sized, as my wife and I were pretty full before our entrees came.  Guacamole, pork empanadas, shrimp & scallop ceviche, a delicious soup the name of which I can't remember, and a turkey & onion frizzled-string taco dish that was one of the more unique and delicious things I've had in a long time. For entrees, we had the pork tenderloin and the carne asada, the latter of which had a nice heat to it.  Desserts were decent, but not my cup of tea; not being much of a dessert eater, I""m pretty picky when I do decide to have something.  (As my father once grandly stated, ""Why would I have dessert when I can have another pork chop?"")  A coconut flan, a tequila-lime marshmallow cake of some sort, and a chocolate-passion fruit torte were lined up on a plate and well-sized and attractive, My only complaints were with some of the minor details unrelated to the food.  The mariachi band was a bit overly loud, making conversation difficult at times.  The interior wall next to our table had a four-inch gouge in it that needed repairs.  The waitstaff was very nice and friendly overall, but the hostess seemed only partially interested in helping customers and directing where people should go.  I had to ask where to get my coat back, since the coat check woman was nowhere to be found.  The hostess then took my coat check tag, walked about four feet, and proceeded to stop and have a conversation with another employee for about five minutes.  Meanwhile, my wife and I, and another couple, are crowded in the entryway waiting for our coats so we can leave.

Soooo, we get there and ask for a table for 4 and they tell us it's going to be a 1.5 hour wait...there was noBODY waiting...crickets in the foyer...felt like they were trying to deter us from staying bcz we had 2 little kids with us...can't prove it, just sayin.  Any who, we say okay we'll wait...we go to the bar and order a drink and before our drink even arrives, the buzzer goes off...how predictable. As we're making our way to the host stand, some friends call and say they want to meet us and are a block away...they have 8 in their party.  I ask the host and he says 2 hour wait if we want to all sit together...even though there is an open 8-top right next to the 4-top table we're sitting at...he tells us that's for a reservation which is supposed to arrive in an HOUR...I tell him we'll be done by then but he refuses.

After looking over the kids menu, everything was super seasoned...nothing plain for picky eaters.  I figure, no biggie, I'll just ask for cheese quesadillas...waiter comes back 5 minutes later and we ask if the kids can get the quesadillas with cheese only and he says no...everything comes as-is, no modifications.  WTF?!  So we ordered what looked to be the 2 most kid-friendly items but they were SOOO spicy and heavily seasoned...kid's were SOO hungry and there wasn't ANYTHING they could bring them to eat.  AWFUL! The dishes we ordered were so so spicy, I couldn't even eat it...I ordered Tacos al Carbon and it was a joke...a small little pile of meat and some tortillas (kids actually ended up eating them since thier meals were inedible).  Hubby's dish tasted gamey...he ordered the Enchiladas de Mole Poblano. Food and drinks here are expensive and portions are small...and the food was crap. Food, across the board, was awful.  Service was beyond awful.  Drinks were great.  If you have kids, don't eat here...they don't like children.

I've seen him on the American TV show Top Chef myself and my 3 amigos are very much looking forward to trying his food. We head for brunch on a Saturday morning. Chicago is certainly my kind of town. We're there a little early, it doesn't open til half ten and have a quick coffee in Starbucks. When we get back a healthy que has already formed. Once we get into the restaurant we are hit with a lively, happy and warm atmosphere. The colours on the wall are all sandy light browns with Mexican paraphernalia dotted around. Our waiter is wonderful and friendly and we are brought to our table at the corner of the restaurant. The menu has lots of options; snacks, guacamole, soups, salads, tacos, enchiladas and specials. We order the Tostaditas to share for starters, tasty home made warm tortilla chips which come with beautiful dips. I eye one of the specials for my main: Sapitos, a trio of Xalapa-style gorditas (corn masa cakes) in chipotle-black bean sauce each with its own topping: scrambled eggs, grilled chicken, chorizo, plantains; homemade crema & queso fresco. My girlfriend coozes over the sound of the Hot Cakes; corn pancakes with whipped goats cheese that comes with bacon and eggs. She also orders the home made lemonade which is spikey! My dish is beautiful; each component of the food melds together and isn't too heavy. Reagan's hot cakes are also delicious with ample slices of bacon. I wash this down with a surprisingly unspectacular coffee. Brunch for four comes to $90, for such a well known prestigious chef with such excellent food I find this excellent value. And there is nothing pretentious about Frontera, it's atmosphere is of an enjoyable, happy restaurant and is in no way stiff or formal, the food is the star, pure quality.

When I dined there, I sampled the Trio of Ceviche, the Queso Fundido Clasico, Duck Tacos al Carbon, and the Topolobampo Tortilla Soup.  For the most part, these dishes were good but none of them was outstanding or had robust flavor.  The flavors of each dish seemed to be muted so as not to turn off any diners.  Nothing was that spicy, despite the fact that the waiter or the menu described it as such.  In general, much of the appeal of Mexican food is its robust flavor, and Mexican cuisine does not benefit from subtlety as well as some other cuisines do. In contrast, while the food was lacking in the flavor department, the drinks were not.  Frontera Grill has a bevy of unique and excellent tequila based cocktails (and I don't normally enjoy tequila - and usually avoid it at all costs).   My disappointment in Frontera Grill may have had something to do with my high expectations.  Given the accolades that Rick Bayless has received, I guess I was expecting more of a Thomas Keller type experience which Frontera Grill did not deliver.",0.9777,0.793,0.146,0.061,0.5213043478260869

Service was excellent - our server was cheerful, helpful and competent.  She recommended as a starter a small casserole of mixed fall vegetables (baked apple, parsnips, cauliflower) with a creamy sauce and just a bit of heat.  My mouth is watering just remembering it. Then we tried a duck tamal -- fresh corn masa with duck carnitas and a chile sauce -- also very good.  The sweet potato sopes with pork were ok.  The pork had good flavor, although I didn't catch much orange.  Frijoles charros were excellent. A cold salad of jicama, cucumber & pineapple was sort of meh.  I was expecting more of a slaw.  Instead there were large pieces cut like cold French fries.  That would have been ok but there wasn't enough lime and the chile power sprinkled on top left the bottom pieces with no seasoning at all -- it was basically just raw jicama. For an entree I ordered the cobia en crema de calabaza.  The cobia was grilled perfectly, tender, with a smoky glaze.  Great flavor.  However, I was looking forward to the spaghetti squash accompaniment listed on the menu and there wasn't any.  Instead, there was a little pyramid of rice.  Still good, but a little disappointing. Dessert was a small spice cake with white chocolate ice cream.  Just fabulous and the perfect ending. Now for a quibble.  Since I was taking out-of-town guests I checked  rickbayless.com  for reservation information.  The site clearly says Frontera takes a limited number of reservations -- call the phone number.  I called the phone number 3 times, and each time heard a recording telling me to ""check the website"" for all the information.  Click.  Really frustrating.  If they don't want to talk to customers, then why provide a phone number in the first place?  Go early and get in line -- it's your only hope.",0.993,0.759,0.192,0.048,0.5682408424908425

Frontera lives up to the hype. We went to Frontera for lunch on a week day, to avoid the dinner crowd. The service was great. Our waitress was attentive, friendly, and accommodating. She even checked with the chef regarding my husband's food allergies (almonds - random, I know) and thank God she did, because apparently the mole is chock-full of them. Like a good wife, I ordered the mole poblano anyway, and provided my husband with a full report on just how delicious it was :) We started with the Trio Trio Trio Ceviche, which was a trio (go figure) sampling of lime-marinated albacore, Mexican blue shrimp and calamari, and Hawaiian yellowfin tuna. The presentation was vibrant and beautiful and the flavors were delicious. A great start to our meal. We also ordered the chips and salsa. Rick Bayless' tomatillo salsa is amazing! It's so bright and has so much flavor, I wanted to pour it over everything. For entrees, I ordered the Enchiladas de Mole Poblano and my hubby ordered the Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena. I am very picky about mole and so far have disliked every restaurant mole I've ever tasted. Then came Frontera - holy mole! This mole was rich, creamy, perfectly sweet and savory at the same time. Everything a mole should be. Outwardly, I expressed my sympathy to my husband that he couldn't try any of it, but inwardly I secretly thanked Rick Bayless for using almonds in his mole so I wouldn't have to share. It was that good. The carne asada was amazing as well. So tender and juicy and perfectly seasoned. I've had a lot of carne asada that is pounded so thin that it dries out and tastes cardboard-like. Not this carne asada. It was thick, succulent and marinated to perfection. The Topolo Margaritas were great - really fresh, not to sweet, super strong. We also tried the Mexican Mojito with tequila, which was a refreshing alternative to the traditional rum mojito (and very strong as well). To top off our meal, our waitress brought out the chocolate pecan pie topped with a birthday candle (we were in Chicago for my birthday) and ""Happy Birthday"" written in chocolate sauce. Although not the highlight of the meal, it was certainly a sweet way to end our lunch. Overall, Frontera Grill is a solid 4.5 stars. Colorful ambiance, friendly service, delicious food.

For the most part - yes.  But it I think FG is so over-hyped that I was expecting something ""out of this world.""  So yes, its good, but its not a GOAT (""Greatest of All Time"") restaurant.  The ambiance is ok, with nice artwork mixed with saturated red walls.  The table we were originally seated in was uneven and we had to re-locate to another table (a bad first impression).  I made a reservation 2 weeks in advance, and my understanding is that I was ""lucky"" to reserve a table for a weekend dinner 2 weeks in advance.  But I hear that if you come early (around 5 or earlier for dinner) you may be able to get seated that night if there are ""no-shows"" or if space is available. We started with the trio-trio ceviche - this was a wonderful starter!  Each one was full of flavor that just burst into your mouth.  My tongue was satisfied.  For the entree, I had the Chicken mole, it was good, but a tad bit too heavy on the sodium.  The portions were also fair, but at $24 for the mole, its pretty pricey and I expected more (for what you pay for).  The service was excellent, with a person carrying a water canteen coming by every three minutes to re-fill my water.  Fantastic.  Our server was also attentive and made sure our needs were fulfilled. Overall, this is great place and the food is good.  In LA, there is a place called Border Grill in Santa Monica.  I thought both the decor and the food (please dont get upset Mr. Bayless) reminded me of that place.  So if you like Border Grill, you will like FG.   But remember that Public Enemy song.",0.9958,0.782,0.181,0.037,0.616168091168091

The Topolo margarita had Sauza Conmemorativo tequila, Torres orange liqueur, housemade limonada and was shaken tableside. It was my fave of the two varietals, being a true margarita taste. Smooth and just delicious. If you prefer a more sour margarita the Blue Agave should be your choice. I loved it too but two would likely send my pucker over the top. I started with that but my stomach was happier when I switched. Both were to die for yet totally different, neither had mixers or cheap ass tequila and were created to utter perfection. That alone makes me love the Frontera Grill. My experience here was some meh but still decent and some over the top OMG wow. For the meh: We started with a snobby dick of a bartender. We were like the fourth couple to come to the bar and after ten minutes still no margarita. I don't know if its because we were two women or he just didn't like our looks but we were sitting directly in front of the guy and he totally ignored us, even after I got out money to give him a clue we were thirsty ass lushes. I was a bit miffed after we had stood in line for quite awhile that I could not get a drink from a bar that had three guys mixing it up. He had the I'm too sexy thing going on and was never friendly to anyone he served, but hey I was jealous of them anyway because they had margaritas. Dude get over yourself. You missed out on money because I seriously overtip, just ask my sister. Also if you had ponied up I would have probably had three margaitas instead of two. Bad way to start an evening Mr. Bayless, it is mean to tease me like that.  I made a mistake ordering one of our entrees. They have two carne asadas. Make sure you order the one with rib steak as the cheaper one with flank steak is just meh. Our order did have amazing sides (a shredded salad with jalapenos, an over the top tasty corncake with homemade crema and cheese, homemade tortillas and some delicious grilled knob onions), but the steak itself was not seasoned enough and was just nothing lighting up my tastebuds. If I had ordered it anywhere else I would have been fine but I really was disappointed here. I also was sad about the Verduras en Escabeche, which are homemade pickled jalapenos with carrots & cauliflower. We got ours and it was all jalapenos, I like jalapenos but c'mon, thats 2/3 of a dish missing and it made it just way too hot. I said something to our great waitress, Karla, about the lack of carrots and cauliflower because they were the main reason I ordered the dish. I am a total sucker for pickled carrots and cauliflower. She went back to the kitchen to score me some but they apparently had none, hmmm odd. She did offer graciously take the whole item off our bill which I appreciated. I was still a little disappointed though. Oh and the chips here, while homemade, were just too thick and not doing it for either of us. For the wow: Best.freaking.guac.ever. It was so creamy, so addictive, just rich and buttery. The tomatillo salsa was hands down  the.best .I.have.ever.had. The other salsa was good but we devoured the green like nobody's business. It made upfor the chips, who cares when the dippers are this terrific. I did redeem myself with our other entree thank goodness. Costillas Enchipotladas,  the.best .damn.ribs.ever. Sensing a theme here? They are chipotle glazed, lean yet tender. I looked up from eating at some point and my skinny sister had picked five bones clean already. That is a true testament to how good they were, she is usually a more petite eater than I am. We were still talking about this dish long after we were finished. It was served with some perfect black beans, smashed just a tad so they were a little creamy but not in any way soupy. These were thick and just my thing. Platanos con Crema here were amazing. Sweet fried plantains with homemade crema and fresh cheese. The salty/sweet thing always works for me. I loved these with the black beans from my rib dish. I was absolutely shocked at how delicious dessert here was. I never indulge this much usually but my sister again is a terrible influence and frankly it did not take any arm twisting. I figured after a three bottle of wine and shots the night before, well really why the hell not.  The chocolate pecan pie here was lovely. I picked it and was fairly delighted with myself. Then my sister trumped my ass. Two ice creams, salted pecan with brandy and cajeta with dark rum with homemade cajeta (goat milk caramel) sauce on top. Good lord it was sinful. I am totally willing to risk a diabetic coma for this. I could not resist.

Unfortunately, I cannot remember the exact names of the items we ordered, but I do remember their main components. Anyway -we began by ordering 2 appetizers: the Sopas and Tamales. They were amazing and I could not get enough!  We also ordered drinks. My sister ordered some type of jamaica juice and I ordered a tequila cucumber (some type of margarita): both were delicious! I could have had 10 more if I wasn't driving. Lucky for us our main course came. I ordered the steak with plantains, my boyfriend ordered another steak dish with tamales, my sister ordered a shrimp dish, and our friend ordered the salmon. The meals were delicious! Finally, for dessert we ordered the two flans, an empanada plate, and homemade ice cream with caramel. My favorite was the ice cream it was scrumptious!

Service: Definitely a significant point for this place - all the staff from the front desk to wait staff to bar staff were all friendly and helpful. Food: We went for brunch but had made the mistake of seeing the dinner menu online which was very different (much more interesting and diverse). We had two mains with two desserts amongst three diners and it was more than enough. Some interesting flavors, but one dish had what were like nachos cooked in a chile sauce. The flavor was fine but the texture of mushy nachos was a little odd. The swordfish was okay - fresh and well prepared but not Earth-shattering.

I've been to many noteworthy restaurants, and haven't changed my #1 favorite restaurant designation in over a decade, but my new favorite restaurant is Frontera Grill. We were so impressed that after dining there Thursday night armed with a reservation, we went again Saturday night and braved the notoriously long wait list.  Why did we go twice on our vacation? Because dining experience is everything we look for, amazing food that dazzles the palate, knowledgeable friendly service, and a great buzz in the restaurant.  Every bite just popped in taste and texture, and had an incredible depth of flavor. I won't critique each dish, but I'll just say that I would gladly order any of them again. Even the drinks were special, the Topolo margarita hand-shaken table side, was easily the best margarita I've ever had, it was beautifully balanced and complimented the food - just perfect.  Equally important to the experience is the service and our server on the first night was Juan S. who was exceptional. He was friendly, didn't rush us, made great recommendations, and had the answers to several of my questions (I like to cook and try to pick things up wherever I can). On our second visit we had a different server who was also good, but Juan saw us and took the time to stop by and talk to us, and made sure we were well taken care of throughout the night even though he didn't have our table.  Unlike many celebrity chefs who are rarely at their restaurants, we saw Chef Bayless both nights and was told that he is at his restaurant about 80% of the time. On the second night we were dining on the chef's counter and towards the end of our meal he sat next to us for his dinner; unfortunately our waiter told us he was under the weather so we didn't get a chance to meet him.

Frontera Grill is aesthetically pleasing, the servers are very friendly, and the artwork and atmosphere is certainly lively. You pay for gourmet prices, but sadly, you don't get what you pay for. As an appetizer, I ordered the tortilla soup which was delicious at first, but half way through I realized was much too salty. For lunch, the four of us ordered the mole chicken enchiladas, the duck quesadillas, the duck enchiladas, and the chicken and shrimp combo. Anything that had chicken in it was too dry. The mole sauce was a strange blend of too sweet and salty, and the sauce was clumpy, like chili. I've never had such thick mole sauce before. The duck enchiladas were probably my favorite because it wasn't too dry like the mole enchiladas, but DUCK in Mexican food is a little too weird for me. The shrimp was good, and the quesadillas were good too, just a tad on the greasy side. The salad that comes with every dish is very bitter, but I don't really like radish or feta cheese. Oh, and almost everything (even the beans) comes with feta cheese on top. For dessert, we had churros and I ordered a hot chocolate with almond milk.

2011-09-27,3.0,"I've eaten at Frontera a dozen times. Likes:  The Topolo margarita. It is very good, one of my favorites. A bit on the small side for $10 bucks, but it has a great flavor. The chips and dips. Good flavor on both sauces and thick chips. $4 charge once again is a bit steep, especially when other places include them in your meal at no charge. Dislikes: The food always sounds great, the descriptions of the ingredients and plate presentations are very good. The issue I have is the food never tastes as good as it sounds or looks. Don't get me wrong, it has complex flavors and seems to be made with fresh ingredients, but all the dishes seem to lack salt (I am not a salt lover, but you need a touch to bring out flavors) and other times the sauces don't complement the protein ( a dark mole type sauce does not go with fish, even in Mexico, dark moles come from the intrior of Mexico...not much seafood there). I keep going back because I don't care for greasy ""tex-mex"" and Frontera is definately several steps above that.",0.9641,0.758,0.165,0.077,0.4892500000000001

In my experience at Frontera, the service has always been cordial, but not terribly personal.  I have experienced the same at Xoco (though now that I go there quite often, the staff is much friendlier) and my one visit to Topolobampo.  I guess I'm a fan of warm personal interactions with staff, but I understand that restaurant experiences can't always be that way, particularly when things are very busy.  In any case, I do like the food at Frontera Grill and will enjoy going back in the future...probably at lunch, when the lines aren't crazy.",0.9948,0.782,0.195,0.024,0.45627232142857144

Reservations: Plan in advance.  I tried to get a rez a week ahead and nothing was available on the weekend.   Take your chances: We said screw it and walked straight to Frontera Grill from the hotel right when we settled in after we landed.  We were prepared to wait an hour+ but when I asked for a table they had one at the chef bar for 2.  Perfect!  We were lucky! Environment and vibe: Very casual and the staff are very personable.  Made you feel very welcome and they would give honest opinions on what will taste best and with what.   For example I ordered a cocktail but my ribeye dish was coming soon.  Our waiter told me to get a glass of pinot noir bc I was eating red meat.  The glass of wine was cheaper too so he definitely was looking out for my best interest at heart than a fat tip. Food: Trio sample ceviche - all three were different and served in mini martini glasses with a tray of chips.  I would say this one was average bc 1 was pretty good, the other alright then the 3rd one was too sweet.   Ceviche verde de jurel (yellowtail) - now THIS ceviche was really good.  Very flavorful with lots of citrus & cilantro flavors. Carne asada a la oaxaquena (ribeye) - THIS is the dish you MUST order!  The ribeye steak is perfectly marinated and then fried/broiled.  I was in heaven eating this.  The plaintain with that white sauce and mild white crumbled cheese (I think that's what it was) was so good too.  It had a scoop of guacamole and I would eat the steak with it... and a touch of the habanero sauce that we requested to have that true Mexican taste.  It was the YUMS! Falda asada brava (slices of skirt steak) - I thought this steak was ok because it's bland compared to the ribeye however the sweet corn tamale was DELISH!  I actually never had a tamale before and was told that I am pretty much ruined for all tamales after this one.   From Red ""NO"" to Frontera Grill my view towards Rick Bayless has completely changed.  Thank god we were able to eat here.  The bf is a happy camper.  :)",0.9988,0.748,0.236,0.016,0.5472437888198758

Just Go before they open, wait in line, put your name in, and hit up the bar area for a drink and appetizer while you wait for your table.  The guacamole is excellent but really only big enough for two people. I loved their corn tortilla ships.  We were there on a Wednesday and I had the daily special, Cochinita Pibil, which is achiote-marinated Maple Creek Farm suckling pig roasted in banana leaves. The dish itself is good stuff. Great flavor on the pork and not too dry. The side of black beans were a little bland but a touch of the hot sauce on the table spiced them up well. The server will likely warn you about the salsa served on the side and you would be smart to heed that warning. It is very spicy and a little bit goes a long way.  They have a signature beer, a Belgian wheat, that is brewed for them by Goose Island. It's definitely worth a try for the beer drinkers in the group.  Overall, the food was worth the trip and I appreciate the efforts Chef Bayless puts forth to bring quality meat and produce from local farms to his customers. I did knock off a star due to their seating system. Why not take reservations?

2011-08-15,5.0,"We've been Frontera fans since it opened in 1987. Our most recent visit last Saturday - a surprisingly warm evening in Chicago and we sat outside in the early evening. The experience, as always, was exemplary - we had a new server but she was extremely solicitous and knowledgeable. Jill, the sommelier, recommended a spectacular Chilean cabernet that actually made a great match with the wild B.C. salmon dish on the specials roster. The little Mexico City quesadillas to start are basic but terrific as were the taquitos. Frontera is loud, bustling, a bit chaotic from time to time but if you surrender to the experience you will have the time of your life.  If you're familiar with Americanized Tex Mex -go beyond the basics (enchiladas, tacos al carbon), and try whatever Rick's doing with duck, pork, or seafood. Try the grass fed rib eye - way spicy but way wonderful. The special on Saturday night is ribs - not something you'd expect in a Mexican fine dining establishment but remarkable nervertheless. Other favorites from this year - whatever he is doing with duck is always a 4 star experience; last week the wild salmon was fantastic - in recent months he's done wonderful things with line caught swordfish and halibut.  There are always a couple of main course options in a mole - always wonderful.  Two all time favorites - the Oaxacan carne asada - a rib eye in a marvelous ancho and passilla marinade - one of the best teaks in a america's best steak town - and the ribs (Saturday night only) - I have no idea if they have  Mexican heritage but I can state with confidence that they are among the best ribs in the Windy City The Topoolo margaritas, prepared tableside are worth the extra $3-4. The wine list is moderate in length and there are many expensive options. But there are many moderately priced options that are wonderful. Ask any of the three sommeliers on duty for a recommendation in your price range and you'll come away more than pleased.   Tip: best ways to snag a table. Tues and Wed nights can be relatively quiet during the mid part of the evening in the slower months of the year. Try Saturday brunch which fills quickly but you'll never have to wait more than 15-20 minutes.  For a Friday or Saturday night walk over from your office or home at 530 or 6 - leave your name and tell them you'll be back at 8 or 830 - head to the movies and when you get back your table will be waiting.

I got the Wednesday special which was a marinated pork roasted in banana leaves, served with black beans and a red chile sauce.  This may have been the best mexican dish I've ever eaten in my life.  It also comes with a side of habanero salsa that is literally too spicy to enjoy even if you dip only the tip of one tine of your fork in it. Two people at my table got the alaskan salmon with a peanut sauce.  Reaction was mixed; one strongly in favor and one unsure of what she thought.  Not being much of a peanut enthusiast myself, I was unable to comment.  Also, the flank steak was pretty well received at my table. The appetizers were fairly disappointing to our group.  The guacamole is fantastic, although a smallish serving for a $10 appetizer.  The queso fundido is not your typical fundido, and the sharp cheddar (which i was surprised to see here) had kind of a funky effect on the dish.  We also got a yellowfin tuna ceviche which I was extremely disappointed in; it felt unseasoned, with no real citrus to speak of.

Everyone at my table loved their food - especially the mole which was to die for, and we shared guacamole and queso fundido, both of which were some of the best I've ever had. The margaritas, too, were delicious. But, I have to drop it down to three stars because everything else was that bad. It's not the restaurant's fault we were there in the middle of a heat wave, or that we had to stand outside for two hours to get in. But it is their fault for not having properly functioning air conditioning or some appropriate alternative. It was literally hotter inside than out, and we were grossly uncomfortable. Everyone was complaining, including a large party eventually seated next to us, which prompted the manager to bring a fan out of the kitchen and point it directly at them. Of course that didn't help everyone else. In addition to being that hot, the service was painfully slow. After waiting two hours and then being seated in the sweltering heat without any explanation, our server took so painfully long for EVERYTHING. It was close to two hours before he brought our meals out, which was excessive even considering that we'd been there about an hour before he ever bothered to take our orders. He was awful and totally unapologetic, the kitchen was slow, the management seemed to have no idea what they were doing.

2011-07-31,4.0,"I loved the food, but even so I found the place a bit too expensive. Maybe it's being used to CA, but guacamole shouldn't be $9.50. I mean, it was good, but not exceptional or anything. But other than the price, I only had minor quibbles with the food and really enjoyed our lunch (and that there was no wait compared to the 45 min wait at xoco). I found a lot of the food to be sweeter than I wanted. Some of this was probably the particular dishes that we chose, but it did seem to be a theme. For example, the coctel de atun tropical - tuna, avocado/tomatillo guacamole, ""tangy"" mango grapefruit salsa. Sounds like it could be tart and tasty, right? Well it was quite good, but... sweet.  I loved the  tamal de chile poblano, which made me only want to order things that use their wonderful masa in the future, although the squash blossom crema went a bit overboard. I couldn't resist the duck carnitas so I got enchiladas de pato. Again, far too sweet for me, but that one was pretty clearly sweet from the menu; otherwise I liked it (the chile toreados were a nice touch). I was surprised that I didn't like the mexican rice - it's very paprika/pimenton-y and not as tomato-y as I like, so I guess it's just a different style. My favorite dish was the tinga poblano cazuela. We were warned that it was an appetizer, but it came with a lot of tortillas and seemed to be an excellent lunch size to me! I also liked the spiciness in the items that were spicy. The habanero salsa was really hot but still flavorful, and you could appreciate the heat without feeling like your tongue is being assaulted. Service and drinks were excellent. We enjoyed sitting outside despite the location on a fairly busy street.",0.9983,0.701,0.268,0.031,0.6626818783068784
2011-07-30,3.0,"Now I know alcohol can impair judgment, but I did not realize how much until now. I first visited Frontera Grill July, 2010 for my 30th birthday. Being new to the city, I was not aware of the fact that the restaurant needed at least an 8 week notice for reservation. We put our names in a 5 pm and were seated around 730. In the meantime, we all indulged in a couple of cocktails. I dont know if it was the alcohol or the hunger, but when we finally got our food, it felt as though every bite was a heavenly explosion of spicy goodness. From the ceviche, to the queso fundido, not a single appetizer was a disappointment. At that time, they had a flank steak on their menu. I had it prepared medium rare...OMG amazing. My friend got ribs, which for not being a BBQ place, were amazing! The only mildly disappointing thing ordered were the chicken tacos...oh well. No one can be 100% perfect. Fast forward to April, 2011.  My friend and I wanted to relive the experience of Frontera Grill.  Before her visit, she made reservations in February so that when she came we would not have to wait!  They were prompt in seating us for our Saturday, 9 pm reservation. Unfortunately, the promptness ended there. When seated, we ordered some specialty drinks and tortilla soup for an appetizer.  I would say almost 15 or 20 minutes went by and there was no soup or drinks in sight.  The waiter FINALLY came by and realized we hadn't received either. He apologized, went back to the kitchen, and brought out our soups.  I am pretty sure that Chili's serves a better tortilla soup than what we ate.  Not only was it beyond salty, it had been sitting so long, it was cold. Oh, and we finally received our drinks after half an hour. I think they had alcohol in them? Theoretically, we paid for alcholic drinks. Sadly, the meal wasn't any better.  I ordered a steak dish, medium well.  It was cooked ok, but the cut of meat was pretty mediocre.  It was chewy/grainy and kept getting stuck in my teeth.  As far as flavor is concerned, I almost want to say I had a better experience at Las Tablas. I am normally a fan of Mexican Rice, but I think instead of making their own, I swear they substituted the rice for Uncle Ben's.  Terrible. I had to choose 3 stars vs. any lower since the first time was phenomenal.

2011-07-27,4.0,"I don't know if I can sufficiently add anything new to this discussion that other reviewers haven't already touched upon.  This is a very good restaurant.  If you're visiting Chicago and would love to eat some tasty Mexican cuisine, this is definitely a place to consider.  Another good reason to check this place out is to determine whether there is too much hype placed on famed TV chef Rick Bayless.   First, we called for reservations on a Thursday as soon as the restaurant opened, and we were quoted for a four hour wait.  Understandable, since there were eight of us.  They phoned us exactly four hours later to tell us that our table was ready.  Arrive at the restaurant and we weren't seated for another 45 minutes as the people who just finished their meal decided to sit around and shoot the ish.  Mildly annoying, but I cannot fault the restaurant. For appetizers we started off with the guacamole, which was outstanding.  It was chunky, but yet surprisingly creamy at the same time.  My only let-down with the dish was the lack of any hint of spiciness.  I'm guessing there are no jalepenos/serranos mixed in.  The accompanying tomatillo salsa and red salsa were very good as well.  I highly recommend combining the guac and the sauces on one chip. Very tasty. For every Mexican restaurant for the first time, I ALWAYS get the steak tacos and it serves as a great point of reference for me.  The tacos were good, but they didn't really compare to some of the tacos I've had out west (particularly San Fran and San Diego).  The steak was prepared to a perfect medium, but I thought the marinade/seasoning could have been a little stronger.  My fiancée had the tacos al pastor and I was blown away by how bold the pork was in contrast to my steak.  If you order tacos, make sure to get that one!  We skipped dessert. I think this place is good, but I also believe that the hype/satisfaction ratio is a bit high.  Despite that, I'd definitely come back to try the tacos al pastor.  If you're quoted a wait longer than 90 minutes, I'd suggest finding someplace else to eat downtown.",0.9955,0.815,0.162,0.023,0.46597502805836144

The restaurants are literally joined together and one checks in at he same hostess station for both. We found nothing ordinary about these places and they deserve all the hype they have received. I thought the Barbacoa de Chivo (overnight wood-oven goat) dish was to die for. The ""Trio, Trio, Trio: Sampling of Ceviche Fronterizo, Ceviche Yucateco & Coctail de Atun Tropical"" was superb. (I had it twice.) Also excellent was Carne Asada ""Brava"" and the Mixiote de Borrego (lamb shoulder slow-roasted in parchment packages with ancho-pasilla sauce). The menu is filled with items I have absolutely never heard of or eaten at all anywhere in San Diego or in Baja. I have read in one Rick Bayless book that East LA can compete somehow, but I haven't tried going there ever. Now I am tempted. As for the drinks, I had a large local Belgian ale-type beer called La Fleur of all things. The marguerites were nice but not as unusual as everything else. I should add, I ate at several two-star Michelin places in Chicago that impressed me less than these Bayless landmarks. I missed (not for lack of trying) the allegedly divine Alinea (three stars) although they called me twice with last-minute cancellations. But I didn't return the calls in time.

We got a table in the bar area, which was a little noisy, but ok nonetheless.  We started with guacamole which is creamy with some chunks of avocado and tomato.  It was not spicy at all and almost a little sweet.  We also got the taquitos de pollo ahumado which were delicious.  They were also nicely presented (see photo).  The two salsas, green and red are very good as well.  The red one has a unique smoky flavor. For an entree I had the Pollo en Escabeche de Chabacano.  It was a super mix of flavors, some tangy, some spicy.  The chicken was moist and tender.  My date had the Enchiladas de Mole Poblano.  The dish was also wonderful, very rich though, and chocolately flavored.  This dish was large compared to mine, although looking around at others', it seems that the dishes vary greatly in size. For dessert we had the duo de flanes.  I was looking forward to the chocolate mint infused one, but was disappointed by its herbal flavor, although my date really liked it, and the raspberries were nice and tart.  That one had a creamier texture than the classic vanilla, which was basically just what it says in flavor and texture, classic.

Nope. Drinks were awful. I have had much better margaritas and mojitos at Pure Tacqueria in Atlanta at half the price.  Table Service - awful.

We did not realize when we made the reservation that Saturday was a brunch menu, quite different from their normal lunch menu, which was unfortunate in that it resulted in our not being able to try the trio of ceviches, which we had heard was quite good. We did manage to obtain the Tostaditas de Ceviche, which was excellent, and the Enchiladas de Mole Poblano which were simply amazing.  Some of the clearest flavors I've had in Mexican cuisine.  Tacos al Carbon were very nice, though I suspect it is possible to get very good tacos fairly simply and for less money elsewhere. For drinks, we were disappointed that they were apparently out of some ingredient or other in their ""Sparkling Passion"" cocktail, though we did get to try it later at Topolobampo, and it was very good.  ""La Margarita Italiana"" was both interesting and well-made, containing Cynar, an artichoke based liqueur.  They had a couple of beers on tap, including one called Marisol made specially for them by Goose Island, which was tasty ( and an ingredient in the Sparkling Passion cocktail, in fact ). Dessert - ""Tres Leches de Fresa Y Tequila"" - a tres leches cake - was surprisingly well-plated and complex.  And delicious. The restaurant itself is not large and rather crowded, as would be expected.  It is an informal place, for sure.  Service was relatively competent and plenty friendly, but not the fastest.  Drinks, in particular, seemed to take a long time. After trying all three of the Rick Bayless restaurants on this corner ( Topolobampo and XOCO are the others in the same building ) over the course of a week's visit, I would have to say that Frontera was the best experience out of the three.  We did not end up trying a lot of dishes here, but every single dish we did try was a big hit.",0.979,0.87,0.11,0.019,0.5187725959677179
2011-07-05,4.0,"I liked Frontera Grill.  I've eaten at Xoco many times, and I'm quite familiar with the career arc of Chef Bayless.  The food at Frontera was good - the quality was what I expected.  The service was friendly and professional, too.  So I'm definitely a fan.  But for me it didn't break into my rank of favorites.  Maybe it was my dish, which was good, but just not very interesting.  The description sounded fantastic, and it did taste good, but it was much less interesting, both visually and taste-wise, than the description led me to believe it would be.   So, bottom line, it was good food - certainly better than average for this price point.  I enjoyed my visit and I don't have any real complaints.  But I think for me to give them five stars, I'd have to want to wait in their super-long lines (I was there under one of their rare reservations that seem to be allowed mostly for out-of-towners like the couple I ate with).  I'd happily go again with a reservation or on some rainy night when people haven't mobbed it, but I don't think I'd be willing to wait in a long line for it, which is why I am a fan, but not a five-starred one.",0.9892,0.741,0.211,0.048,0.5346646942800789

The drink menu changes frequently too so dont hesitate or second guess trying a drink because i may not be there the next time you come back to visit and you will have lost the opportunity to taste it!!

2011-07-01,5.0,"Rockstar Rick's presence in the city of Chicago may just be my favorite part of living here. His collection of restaurants situated all around this corner inspires me to gluttonous efforts every time I'm around.  I knew that our supper club could not really move forward without checking Frontera off our list. It's not a simple endeavor. So, I decided to take this one upon myself. Here's the drill: doors open at 5 sharp (5:20 Tuesdays) lines cue up in advance and you can wait it out at the bar until your party arrives. They won't seat you until everyone is there, when you'll get the flashing buzzer. They also take a few reservations well in advance, which I've been able to score for Topolobampo, the more upscale twin next door (highly recommended). And so it was that after a short wait in the afternoon sun and calling out a lingerer that tried in vain to bypass the organization of the line, I was cozied up at the bar awaiting friends over a good book and better margarita. Personally, I like the Topolo and Blue Agave margs. They also have a huge selections of tequila. Our group arrived as the drinks flowed. Just grab one of the guys busily working the room and they will get you all set. Shout out to our man for bringing our next round and bill to the table to settle once we were on. That was a nice touch, not that they miss any here.  The six of us settled in for a feast. We got a bunch of appetizers to sample: Guac, salsa and chips. Tomatillo, Chipotle and Habenero salsa. Ceviche trio, of which the Hawaiian tuna was the best of the lot. The jicama salad perfectly cooled the intense heat of the habenero salsa, which I always have to get to test the boundaries of pain. These were all great calls to start and you'll surely want to have at least one of those. Now when it comes to the mains here, you want to be adventurous. You can't go wrong with the rellenos, but if you're not one of the first tables of the night, they will already be gone. Rick's moles are what to get-trust me. Red chile-rubbed Gunthorp duck breast, Oaxacan mole coloradito (ancho chiles, sesame seeds, spices, Oaxacan chocolate), Iroquois white corn torta (sesame, hint of chocolate), grilled green beans. So many different flavors going on with this one, I loved it. The dayboat catch of swordfish at the other end of the table looked great and everyone enjoyed the cuisine. I was not about to leave without dessert and the Cafe de olla, fruity sugary coffee goodness. We got a few desserts and made short work of them, the tres leches cake and the chocolate pecan pie, which reminds me of a derby pie. Love the Kahlua topping on that one. Yummy.  I'm almost forgetting about how cool this restaurant is. There are neat paintings and pinata looking dragons all around. The service was flawless and professional. They got to us quickly and though there was a good wait, excellent company passes it easily. You could always just snack on some small bites in the bar area and make a meal of that and the drinks and have a fantastic meal.  I never did see the waiter with the wicked cool handlebar mustache that I've seen here for the last decade (where you at bro?). But, that hardly made a difference. For now, I'll just be content knowing that perhaps the best restaurant in our nation is right here in our town. Rockstar Rick we love ya!",0.9984,0.821,0.166,0.013,0.5204776077097507

2011-06-29,2.0,"For me, Frontera Grill is a 2-stars, even if I was never afforded the opportunity to eat there.  Accessibility is to optimize profits for Rick Bayless, not to allow customers to have a good meal. The first thing you have to know is that three Rick Bayless restaurants are in the same storefront.  A few years ago, my wife and I came to Chicago and thought we'd try one of the Rick Bayless Mexican restaurants.  We know Mexican food - Arizona, Mexican-American, cook it ourselves, SF Bay Area, etc. We found that on our limited time, we could only get into Topolobampo.  We went there for dinner.  The food was very stylish, small portions, multiple courses, expensive  -- overall not a good financial proposition unless you ""wanted to say you'd eaten there"".  Not us.  We like Mexican food because it is food. So this trip, the Frontera Grill seemed a possibility.  The menu shows real meals - not snacks.  We wanted to eat, not be seen. On entering at 6 PM, we were told the wait is 90-120 minutes.  Our attempt was to eat once again, not appear in some production.  Disappointed, I asked at what time one might come to have dinner without the wait? I was told: ""Make a reservation"".  I said that I'd been to their website and it said they don't take reservations?  I was told they did.  So as a manager walked up, I said ""We'd like to make a reservation for tomorrow night, please"".  He interrupted my conversation with the hostess and said ""Our first reservations are three weeks from tonight"".  Huh? So they wouldn't tell me when I could sit down to eat if I came at another time, they mislead me by saying I could make a reservation -  but not in the lifetime of our one week visit to Chicago, and they were just plain down snooty and arrogant.  (We ate at a very excellent Indian food restaurant 1 1/2 blocks away.  Some of the best Indian food we've had - and we've had plenty.) I figured it out.  Topolobampo is exquisitively expensive and plays to Rick Bayless' ego.  But not enough customers -- you CAN make reservations there.  Frontera Grill, it serves regular Mexican food meals that might be enjoyable and a reasonable deal -- BUT  -- to maximize revenues Rick won't make (real) reservations, but packs you in as you wait for the shmucks before you to leave.

2011-06-29,5.0,"We started off with an appetizer of Sashimi-grade Hawaiian yellow fin tuna, avocado-tomatillo guacamole, tangy mango-grapefruit salsa. As we ate the fish, the big flavors really became apparent. We needed to mix it up to get all of the flavors, and once we realized that we loved this dish.  The husband ordered the Grill-roasted Gunthorp pork loin, fruit-studded ancho-almond mole, grilled pineapple tamal, braised quelites (bacon, grilled white onions), crispy chorizo. His dish was good but the meat was a little dry and the flavors weren't as bold as you might think based on the description. I ordered the special which was the Cochinita Pibil: Achiote-marinated Maple Creek Farm suckling pig roasted in banana leaves. My dish was FANTASTIC, the pork was so tender and flavorful. I had zero issues finishing everything (except for the habanero sauce) on my plate!  Our server was a bit over the top and it seemed forced, but he was nice and attentive. We did ask for something (I wish I could remember what it was) and we were told that the food is from a certain region and what we asked for wouldn't work. Ummm... Okay, whateva.

We started with the sunrise cocktail which our waiter totally sold us on when he said that one of the components was only made for the restaurant.  It was deliciously refreshing.   For appetizers we got the short rib taquitos and chorizo-topped queso fundito.  Both really good and full of flavor, but then again, when is anything fried, cheesy or chorizo-topped NOT good?!  My friend and I got the mole enchiladas and the steak tacos.  This was my first time having mole so I figured, what a better time then to try Bayless' mole!?  Not my cup of tea.. but it could have been anyone's mole and I don't think it would have tickled my fancy.  Not big on the sweet factor.  The chicken was also pretty spicy and I'm a wimp when it comes to spice.  My friend LOVED it so I assume for mole fans, it's the business.   The steak for the tacos was good.  Great marinade and spice, cooked to medium-rare. They came out as a build-your-own sort of deal.  Not big on that either.  I can make my own tacos at home.  If I'm paying for them, I'd like them already prepared for me in the way the chef intended me to eat them.  Also, we never got chips and salsa!  What up with that!?   Now as far as the service goes, our waiter could not have been more friendly and honest in his opinions of the food.  We were constantly paid attention to and water was filled up at the appropriate times.  Good time-span between the apps and entrees too.  My advice:  make a reservation.  This place isn't worth waiting an hour for.",0.9969,0.81,0.177,0.013,0.6065350877192983

They took our name and let us into the bar starting at 5 which was semi spacious with a nice menu of unique drinks. Wonderful margaritas with good bartenders! We only waited for about 30min for a table  because they stagger the seating so there isn't a huge rush for the kitchen. We sat outside. The server and wait staff were outstanding. They had wonderful recommendations and the food was delicious! Get the ceviche trio you won't regret it and both the duck and shrimp entrees were outstanding. Flavors were unique and delicious.

Our server was great, took great care of us even swapped out my salmon when I was too wimpy for the salsa.  I would recommend getting the salsa on the side!  We also split the Entremes surtido which was delicious.  My huband adored his carne asada and we gobbled up the Biscocho con fresas.  Yum!  Plus the Mexican hot chocolate is, duh, delicious!

I say this just to point out that Frontera shouldn't be dismissed as inferior or the fall-back option if you can't get in to Topolobampo. You can't go wrong with anything involving duck or mole. The mole enchiladas and black bean enchiladas are both great. Every type of ceviche I've tried is excellent, as are the cocktails. My friend and I couldn't decide which of the two flans we liked better. Most telling for me, personally, is the fact that I've never reached for the hot sauce while dining at Frontera Grill--to set context, I'm half-Mexican and have a bottle of Tapatio with me at work, so this *never* happens.

2011-05-16,4.0,"I'll admit it: before I moved to Chicago, I had never heard of Rick Bayless. I'm not a foodie, I only passively watch Top Chef when there's a marathon on, and Mexican food is probably my least favorite cuisine.  Rick, you almost made a believer out of me.  If there's one thing I do appreciate, it is a perfect ceviche & a perfect guacamole (ok, that's two things, I lied). On both these accounts, Frontera hits it out of the park. If you are a ceviche fan (or even if you're not), definitely go with the trio. The highlight was definitely the Ceviche Fronterizo. Sadly, the one I thought I'd like the most, the Coctel de Atun, actually turned out to be rather bland.  And the guac. No words. Just do it. I seriously considered licking the bowl, but sadly I've only been here on business lunches. Once I come here and am able to drink alcohol (curse you business lunches!), the bowl will probably be licked clean.  I tried a smattering of the cazuelas: the pollo ahumado is creamy, smoky deliciousness, and the queso fundido is a heavenly heart-attack in melty-cheesy form.  Sadly, the service knocks Frontera down a star--I was tempting to knock it down two. I understand it's lunchtime and it's busy. But when we arrive when the restaurant is still empty at 11:30am, waiting 15 minutes for drink orders alone is unacceptable. And another 30 for chips & guac? Really?!?! Unless someone needed to go hand-pick the avocados for each order, there's no way a lunch crowd should be expected to wait like that.

2011-05-11,5.0,"How dare people even give this place anything less than 5 stars! Rick Bayless is a sheer genius. In case you didn't know, this is his flagship restaurant. I was completely looking forward to trying this place and it lived up to ALL my expectations!  Four words: BEST. MEXICAN. FOOD. EVER. Here's what we ordered: Drinks-- *Scarlet wave - fresh squeezed limeade floating with jamaica flower tea (iced, tangy tea of crimson Jamaica flowers) w/ dash of peychaud *Tangerine mojito - aromatic honey tangerines, d'aristi yucetan rum, lime, fresh mint. Both drinks were unique and refreshing! I felt like I was in heaven :) Appetizers-- *Trio, trio, trio - three ceviches (see below for more detail) Ceviche Fronterizo (lime-marinated hawaian albacore with tomatoes, olives, cilantro, green chile; on crispy tostados) The lime was excellent and strong! Cilantro flavor was wonderful! You could tell it had been marinated for hours!!! Ceviche Yucateco (steamed mexican blue shrimp and calamri, lime, orange, habanero, avocado, jicama, cilantro w/ crispy tortilla chips) A nice sweet tang from the orange, but not overpowering. More subtle than the ceviche froterizo, but incredible on it's own. A beautiful twist on a classic! Coctel de Atun Tropical (sashimi-grade Hawaiian big eye tuna, avocado-tomatillo guacamole, tangy mango-grapefruit salsa). Tasted exactly like an ahi tartare. Not your typical ceviche. Probably the least exceptional of the trio. As with all three, the meat was incredibly fresh. Topolobampo tortilla soup - dark broth flavored with pasilla, grilled chicken, avocado, hand-made jack cheese, thick cream and crisp tortilla chips. Nothing really stood out. The dark broth makes it unique, but I can't quite put my finger on what that taste is. The flavor is quite mysterious and not really my preference, but it was still good.  Sopes Rancheros - crispy corn masa boats, savory shredded beef, roasted tomato, avocado, homemade fresh cheese. The beef was oh-so-savory and the roasted tomato sauce was slightly spicy, but wonderfully juicy like a fresh tomato. The unique Masa boats had a great crunch and pleasantly held up well against the juicy broth. Meal-- Falda asada ""brava""- spicy serrano-marinated grassfed tall grass flank steak, salsa huevona (hand-crushed, grill-roasted tomatoes, jalapenos), grilled knob onions, sweet corn tamales with crema and fresh cheese. The tamales were unexpectedly sweet in a good way. The meat perfectly undercooked. The salsa was crazy addicting and a bit insanely spicy, but I loved it. The onions were sweet. Everything complimented each other nicely, especially the handmade tortillas! Ole! Dessert-- Pastel de chocolate, cacahuate y mango - silky chocolate ganache cake, crunchy candied pecans, height-of-season mango, toasted peanut ice cream. This dessert looks like a torte. They claimed the mango was at the height of the season, but it tasted freaking sour! Nonetheless, I still think some fruit was necessary to balance out the oversweetened taste of the chocolate. I loved the extra salty nuts against the super sweet ganache, plus the cooling effect of the ice cream. It was a good dessert, but I've definitely had better. Can I just say...the service here is exceptional!!!! They don't rush you, they make recommendations to you, and the servers are actually Mexican, so they know what they're talking about! It's funny because the atmosphere is quite kick-back and low-key in many ways, but the incredible food and attentive service makes you feel like you're at a fine dining restaurant! At the same time, the place is very homey, feels extremely authentic, and makes me want to go to Mexico.

I knew it was going to be a good night when we looked at the drink list.  There were a number of craft beers and tasty-looking cocktails.  I had a delicious Cane and Ebel red ale and one of our friends had the delicious Topolo Margarita, which she promptly downed in a few minutes.  I later had one, and can confirm that it was delicious. We decided to share the guacamole to start, which was another good idea.  The guac was fresh and tasty with just a little bit of kick and crispy chips.  So many of the entrees looked good, and I had a hard time whittling down my choices, but the steak called to me because I think I saw it on TV before.  The waiter confirmed to us that the steak was a good choice, as it was something he had as a special treat every Saturday night.  So a friend and I both ordered the carne asada, my wife had the lamb cazuela, white corn tamale, and the jicama salad, and another friend had the jicama salad and the winter root vegetable cazuela, which we were warned was ""very earthy.""   The jicama salads were good, but nothing special.  The corn tamales I thought were pretty good, but my wife loved them.  The root vegetables I didn't get to try, but my friend couldn't finish them.  I was told that it was a bit different, and ""very rich.""  I was too busy enjoying my own meal to try it.  The carne asada was a rib-eye steak -- my favorite -- that was very large, cooked perfectly medium rare, and had a wonderful seasoning / marinade on it.  It had a little bit of spice too, which I appreciated.  The plate also included black beans (which were a bit dry), guac, plantains and sour cream, as well as some delicious tortillas.  I made some delicious tacos, and cleaned up almost the entire plate, because I couldn't stand wasting any of it.  The plantains were sweet and delicious, but I didn't like the fact that they put the sour cream all over the plantains.  Separately, they were both good elements, but together just didn't work for me.   The biggest surprise of the meal was the lamb cazuela, which was a delicious little dish of very tender lamb pieces in a nice little stew-like sauce.  It was only $9.50 I think, but it was probably my second favorite thing I ate that night, other than my steak.   The service was good -- attentive and very helpful -- and overall we just had a great experience at Frontera Grill.  Maybe the shortened wait had something to do with it, but this meal was better than the brunch I had the first time I came here.  I can't wait until my next trip to Chicago!",0.9996,0.744,0.242,0.014,0.5226441631504923

We made reservations 2 months in advance (if you just walk in you'll probably have a 2-3 hour wait), paid too much for parking and were given an obscenely large bill for just ok food.   I recommend skipping Frontera Grill, but if you have to get your Rick Bayless fix try Topolabampo (super pricey but an amazing experience) or Xoco (sandwiches, soups, everyday food - good bang for your buck).",0.9408,0.851,0.12,0.029,0.4839355742296919

The 2 1/2 hour wait to get a table was totally worth it. Her fish preparation, the Pescado en Escabeche, was indeed delicious. It featured the day-boat catch, mahi mahi, in a tangy beet escabeche. My Enchilada de Mole Poblano was also mouthwateringly good. Three chicken enchiladas were served in a spectacular mole perfectly infused with chocolate.  Our tamales were unlike any I've had before. They were sweet and light, almost like cake, topped with crumbled cheese and roasted peppers; without doubt the best tamales I've ever tasted. The Duo de Flanes dessert featured a classic flan and a horchata flavored version. In my humble opinion, the classic flan is the better of the two. I also tried the chocolate pecan pie and was amazed at how much I enjoyed it given I'm not usually a fan of pecan pies.  Not a crumb of that dessert was left on the plate when I was done with it.  For those of you who are balking at the idea of a 2 1/2 hour wait, you always have the option of putting your name on the waiting list and returning later.  But trust me, should you choose to wait, the signature margaritas served in the bar area sure do help make the time fly.",0.9887,0.806,0.173,0.021,0.5272486772486774

We went all out for dinner and started with the shrimp & calamari ceviche with habanero.  The habanero spice was mellowed out by the lime and garlic in the ceviche but it was amazing.  Served with chips I don't think we said much throughout the dish except smiling and commenting on how good it was.  Next we ordered the Flautas de Pato - taquitos filled with duck carnitas and pineapple with a ""tomamole"" sauce of tomatillo, pineapple, and sesame over the top.  Too too good.  For our entrees we had a pork loin in a mole sauce with braised kale.  It was so good that the plate was cleaned entirely.  We could've licked the mole off the plate, but that'd have been rather rude.  The other entree was the special of the day - cochinita pibil- suckling pig roasted in banana leaves.  It was served with a habanero sauce and fresh fried black beans and fresh corn tortillas.  The pork was fall apart tender, but a tad on the salty side.  It made for perfect tacos.  The habanero sauce was extremely hot - so beware if you don't like spicy.  I asked the waiter to pair a wine for me and I received a wonderful Rioja that even went well with the spiciness of the dish. For dessert we shared the custard dish - a vanilla custard that was a lot like flan and a chocolate custard.  The chocolate was rich and velvety but we weren't real keen on the texture. Overall outstanding meal - just the dessert didn't stand out.  The service and attitude of everyone working there is a real treat though.  Nobody seemed like they were dreading being at work which really makes the dining experience for the customer that much better.

The best way to make a fabulous Mexican restaurant is a fabulous margarita. We were able to taste the menu and settled on one to be the best. Blue Agave was very sour... I ordered it bc I love sour and this was too sour. The Gold was OK, nothing too exciting, tastes just like a regular typical one...hands down the best one was the Topolo. Seriously a bomb margarita! I would go back to have one of these again.  Appetizers- you have to order the Trio Trio Trio, which is a trio of ceviches, OMG sooo good and all very different. One is limey, another has a mango or papaya taste and the other is a little spicy.  It was Chris's first time having sopes. I explained to him what it was and he didn't seem excited... but I ordered it anyway. It was delicious, the little corn bowls were fluffy and strong enough to hold the yummy bits of pork inside. Not huge portions so don't be shy putting in an order. Which leads me to the pork... oh the pork! Get anything with pulled pork, whether it's an entree or apps, you won't be disappointed. It's a little on the salty side but they make their own sour cream which is such a nice balance. It's super good. Things we didn't like: Don't order the plantains, they were tough, heavy, and gummy, overall just not very good (see Plantains at Cha Cha Cha in San Francisco!)  The other thing we didn't like were the flautas, kind of felt like the flautas at a Chevy's, not very inventive or worth the prices at a place like Frontera.

2011-02-25,5.0,"Frontera Grill, one of Rick Bayless' Chicago restaurants, aims to please savvy, sustainability-minded customers.  We found their selection of humane animal products to be impressive.  The menu changes every several weeks, but the restaurant's commitment to sourcing welfare-friendly ingredients seems to be a constant.  Information about specific ingredients can be found on the restaurant's website and also on its menu de jour.   Frontera Grill uses chicken and duck that comes from Gunthorp Farms.  The free-range birds spend a lot of their lives outside as they are pastured at three weeks of age.  The Pollo en More Amarillo entree we ordered was quite tender and delicious.   Cage-free eggs come from Little Farm on the Prairie where the hens live outside as weather permits. The restaurant sources it lamb from Crawford Farm, where the animals roam on pastures and eat seasonal forages.  Cheese and dairy products come from Prairie Fruits Farm and Otter Creek Organic Farm.  Prairie Fruits is a completely grass-fed operation while Otter Creek emphasizes rotational grazing and pasture-based living for their organic cows when the weather is hospitable. Beef is from Creekstone Farms or Tallgrass Beef.  Tallgrass Beef is completely grass-fed and grass-finished, meaning that the cows are never fed grain.  Pastured goat is purchased from Pleasant Meadows Farm.  Frontera Grill buys pork from Maple Creek Farm in Wisconsin.  There the pigs are fed sustainably farmed soy and corn. They are semi-confined but allowed to roam regularly. Room for improvement:  Consider sourcing beef products that are completely grass-fed and grass-finished to protect cattle health.  We would also like more information about the production practices on specific farms, namely how the pork is produced.   The Humane Choice is a project of Food Animal Concerns Trust (FACT).

Its really the premise of the movie and it starred Marky Mark as the sexiest science teacher in all of NYC... and it wasn't half bad... or at least M. Wahlberg looked good... or at least it was better than some of M. Night's other crap... *ahemcoughcoughthevillageandeverythingafterSigns. Anyway, that kind of reminds me of Frontera Grill... but in a much more complimentary way. I truly believe that walking in here shuts off the switch in your brain that tells you to stop ordering more food when the entire cavity of your body is already full from the first 983563586328 courses you just ordered. You just keep wanting more.  I proved this on my last visit, where I left feeling like I was hemoraghing... and not just in the usual stomach area. I am Jack's engorged throat muscle. We got a mixed batch of items from the menu, some we'd basically had when we dined at Topolobampo a few months earlier but I remembered liking them more on our prior visit... maybe I was just more buzzed though. I will say that I won't veer toward the queso fundido again. Too much pooling oil on the top made my stomach feel QueSoSo FunDont-O.  Now, keep in mind this was months ago, but the beer cocktail I had was phenom to the 5th Power Ranger. It was called the 'Chupacabra Deluxe' (an ode to my little goatsucker cat, Spooky) and is made with Frontera's Pale Ale with blended local melon puree, and has an iced tea/lemonade mixture shaken in. Yummo. However, This was back in the Summer/Fall so now they have a wintery beer cocktail made with stout that's also on my 'to do' list. Per usual, it was a busy night and I will say that our service was certainly not up to what it was when we dined at Topolobampo, but our meals also weren't as pricey, so there's that. It took an awkwardly long time for our table to get any attention from a server. So much so that we were actually  worried the kitchen would close before we got all of our order in. Luckily, things slowed down a bit and the service picked up towards the latter half of the meal... and I was able to fit in 2 forms of dessert. Would I go back? Sure. I want to try s'more of their cocktail creations and I might get an appy or two while we (surely) wait, but I'd probably save my entrée appetite for Topo or Xoco.",0.9846,0.869,0.097,0.035,0.39543731778425656

2011-02-14,4.0,"Went here mid-January. My BF and I had reservations a week in advance, and ended up getting into town a little later than expected and dealing with an unexpected last-minute housing/hotel crisis - so before we knew it we were an hour late for our reservation on a Saturday night. We called to see if we could still make it, and the receptionist - sounding a bit huffy and annoyed - told us that we'd be welcome as walk-in customers. We expected to wait a long time for a table - but when we got there, we didn't even have time to order a drink at the bar before our table was ready.  Service was just OK. Our waiter took probably 10 minutes to greet us, then another 15-20 to deliver our drinks (it was busy, but still...) and a really long time to close our check. The banquette tables are almost uncomfortably close to each other - a neighboring diner's backside grazed the top of my cocktail as he was returning from the bathroom (...eww).  The food was better than I had expected. I had a tamarind margarita, which was interesting. We split the ceviche trio and chips/salsa as apps. After living in Peru, I'm hypercritical when it comes to ceviche - I would give it a 4/5. One was phenomenal, one was really good, and the other was nothing special.  For entrees, I had the pork loin with a red chile sauce and my BF had the duck in a winter mole. Both were delicious. We left really full. The price point was fair.

2011-01-22,5.0,"My girlfriend and I decided to try to get a seat at one of the coveted Bayless restaurants for our second anneversary dinner, we thought it was a long shot, since we did not have reservations AND it was a Friday night. We figured we would get there 10 minutes before dinner service (4:50 PM) started so we would get the best chance. To our delight, we got to the restaurant and there was only one party in front of us, and the host kindly asked us for our name and we were the second in line. We were ushered into the waiting area, and at 5:00 they let us into the bar area. At about 5:15 (and the restaurant was practically full at this point) we were then seated promptly, and the experience began:  Drinks:  -Mexican Mojito (w/ tequilla) x2 -Topolo Margarita x2 -----Drinks, both were well excuted, I liked the Mojito allittle bit better. Platillos Pequenos:  -Sopes Rancheros (Masa boats filled with shredded beef, avocado, and house made cheese) -Queso Fundito Classico (melted cheese, w/ house made chorizo, onion and mexican oregano served w/ house made corn tortillas) ----Appetizers: thanks to yelp, there were multiple reccomendations for the Sopes Rancheros, and boy did it live up to the hype. I could tell this dish was refined, refined again, and again. The result is the most flavorful mouthful I have ever had. Thankfully for me and you, this item does not rotate on and off the menu. Sorry queso fundito,  but you were no where close to being as good as the sopes. ( i would order something else to replace the queso fundito if i were to to it again.  Especialidades: -Pollo en Mole Verde (chicken with green mole sauce, mexican mashed potatoes, & spinach) -Pato en Mole Xico (duck breast with dark mole sauce, smoky green beans, &  mexican rice) ---------Main Course: all parts of the chicken dish were amazing, the chicken, sauce, potatoes and spinach were all instruments to a symphony in your mouth. The duck dish was good, but not as balanced as the chicken dish, duck was well cooked, sauce was the best part of either dishes (soo smoky and complex), rice was well seasoned, green beans did not really add to the dish but were edible.  Desserts:  -Tamal de Chocolate (chocolate tamale, home made cinnamon ice cream, mexican chocolate glaze) - Mexican Hot Chocolate --------The Tamale de Chocolate was a bit dissapointing to end the meal off, just a mealy chocolate tamale. texturally, it did not come together. The house made cinnamon ice cream was so-so. The mexican hot chocolate saved it though, you could taste the spice that played off the deep flavor of chocolate, it was wonderful.  The whole meal came to allittle less than $130.00, which was really reasonable for the amount, and quality of food and drinks (4 drinks total). The service was nothing short of spectacular, the waiter gave us drink recommendations and shared with us his favorites off of the menu. I dont know what all of the 1 & 2 star reviews on yelp here are for, I cant concieve of giving this place lower than a 4 star review. Rick Bayless, you are an impostor, you are not mexican.

The Florida shrimp in mojo entree was really delicious, with celery root 'noodles' that was similar to the jicama salad but very good as well. The mashed potatoes and salad were pretty flavorless and unnecessary in comparison, but the noodles & shrimp made for delicious tacos. Also the tres camotes soup was very interesting twist on typical butternut squash soup with wheatberries and sunchokes giving an interesting and unusual flavor.  Unfortunately it wasn't served especially hot on this very cold day in Chicago. But by far the best part of the meal was the dessert. Duo of flans, one was pistachio, the other a vanilla with apricots soaked in brandy really stole the show.   It went great with a cafe de olla, which is coffee with orange zest, cinnamon, cloves & piloncillo (brown sugar).

That was just not the fact.  It wasn't spicy or salty, or gritty or gross.  It was just... bleh.  Bland.  Boring. Flavorless.   Unacceptable for Mexican food. The service was alright, but I assume they are used to a tremendous amount of traffic and therefore should be able to run the shop accordingly.  All of the servers seemed rushed, overworked, and kind of reminded me of the greeters at Walmart.  Just plain sick of the cog.

The best thing I ate all night, and one of the best bites I have ever had, was next: Sopes Rancheros.  What a great appetizer.  The shredded beef and sauce on the cornbread-like boat was absolutely incredible.  The other appetizer we had was disappointing, the Queso Fundido de Pollo Ahumado.  The smoked flavor of the chicken was a bit overwhelming and the cheese was very drab.   Our entrees, Pollo en Mole Amarillo and Falda Asada ""Brava"", were both very good.  The flank steak of the latter was my second favorite thing of the night. Oh, also the salsas were absolutely delicious, definitely worth getting. We ended the night with the flan, which tasted very standard, nothing to differentiate it from other flan I've had previously.

We went on a Wednesday night around 8:30pm and we only waited for 30 minutes or so.  The bar area is a pretty cool spot with Mexican artwork popping out from all over. The margaritas were strong and tasty. Once we were brought to our table we had a pretty good idea of what we wanted (as we spent quite awhile googling at the menu while waiting). Try the Ceviche for sure. We started with the Trio, Trio, Trio which is a sampling of Ceviche Fronterizo, Ceviche Yucateco and Coctel de Atun Tropical. All were full of flavor, and I especially enjoyed the Fronterizo as it was very refreshing and full of Cilantro. Might I add that their Guacamole is rather tasty and bursting with flavor, so order that too.  Then we tried Sopes Rancheros and seriously...order this. Just do it and don't ask any questions. I didn't know what the heck a Masa Boat was, but I sure was willing to try it out. The shredded beef just melts in your mouth. For dinner I had this delectable smokey pork with pineapples.

2010-11-22,2.0,"Let me preface with the fact that I'm a big foodie and fan of Rick Bayless. So when this Mexicana from California knew I was Chicago-bound, I told my boyfriend we had to eat at Frontera Grill and pay homage to one of my fav chefs. That said, my expectations were really high, after all, it's Rick Bayless!  I started with a house margarita at the bar to pass the time since it was a 1 1/2 hour wait (tip: make reservations) and when they brought my $9 margarita in what could pass as a  kid's sippy cup I knew we were going to have problems. I snorted my margarita and quickly asked for a Tecate (thinking they had it on tap, like any good high-end Mexican restuarant) and the disappointment continued when they brought it to me IN A CAN with no frosty glass (hey Rick, they do have Tecate in bottles, you know). Ghetto (never thought I'd use ghetto and Frontera Grill in the same sentence...) We found a high (and super small)-table at the bar and since they serve the full menu there we decided to by-pass the 1 1/2 hour wait and just eat at the bar. We next ordered their carnitas taquitos appetizer hoping for redemption. They, along with their chips and two salsas were EXCELLENT. Redemption was found -- but only for a second. Our main courses came. I ordered the chicken mole enchiladas because mole is a complex sauce and can tell me a lot about the authenticity of a Mexican restaurant. The mole was good -- but it wasn't my grandmother's mole, that's for sure. I couldn't narrow down the spice that I felt overwhelmed the sauce -- it was either cumin or coriander. Whichever one it was, there was too much of it and I couldn't taste the infusion of chocolate and peanut butter that you're supposed to taste in a great mole. The plating was also very disappointing. They served the 3 enchiladas (which I have to admit was a very hefty portion, so that was good) with a heap of dried refried black beans. Boo!  My boyfriend ordered the ""tacos al carbon"" and the irony was that HE didn't even know of Rick Bayless and was annoyed I was going to make him wait 1 1/2 hours for seating (but we bypassed that by sitting at the bar), yet his meal was the only hit of the night. The meat was very tasty and credit must be given to the amazing caramelized onions that brought out the flavor of the meat. His meal also came with some really good ""frijoles borrachos"". The tortillas were also very good, almost like my grandmothers.  Neither of our meals came with rice so we ordered a side. It was the ONLY thing that I was tempted on sending back. I thought it was just me, but my boyfriend -- also a bone fide Mexican who grew up on Mexican food -- thought it was, how did he put it? Nasty.  Again, they over did some kind of spice that I was not able to narrow down. Whatever spice it was -- DIDN'T BELONG IN MEXICAN RICE. Mexican rice is simple. You can't mess it up and when it does get messed up it's usually because you're trying to get fancy with it......remember folks, keep it simple. We finished with dessert and again, it was a miss. Flan is NOT supposed to jiggle like Jello!!!! Good flan is dense and rich, just like a custard. We ate the Jello, er flan, and said ""check please."" All in all, the food was ""just okay"" and came no where near in fulfilling the expectation I had for it. If in Chicago again, I would probably go back and give it a second chance, only because it's Rick Bayless and maybe his chefs were having a bad day......

We met the manager while we were waiting on our entrées.  She personally poured our wine.   We showed that we like to talk and she sat with us for about 10 minutes shooting the breeze about the wine I chose... which was also amazing!  Portuguese everything is great!   The manager listened when i said that we were there for my girlfriend's birthday and without saying anything she sent out a chocolate cake and spicy ice cream for a free desert.  I do not expect such things from upper class restaurants and was quite happy to see how well they treat their customers.",0.9979,0.767,0.212,0.021,0.6327409988385598

Also, I had a bad case of ""wah - I like everyone else's food better than mine.""  I appreciated the smokiness of the food, but every single thing we ordered was smokey (except the guac); it would've been nice to have some sort of reprieve.

A handful of dishes came out mostly lukewarm, like they'd been prepared earlier and waited. The food prices weren't outrageous, but drinks were (probably on par with other nice bars downtown, though), but they were fairly expensive. We were hardly surprised by the wait - we arrived at about 4:40 (the restaurant opens at 5 most days) and were seated around 6:15 (and that's with a little bump up the list for being on our honeymoon). When we left, newcomers were being told three hours. As I said, absolutely nothing was bad, but nothing was excellent, and the food was by no means worth the very long wait, the incredibly crowded restaurant, and the higher prices.

I really think that every part of this restaurant is almost as good as it can get. And because of this one must endure ridiculous wait times. I would say if you try and go around ""Dinner Time"" on a Friday or Saturday you will probably have to put your name in and wait about 90 minutes to two hours. The best way to eat here is to 1) Go to the bar and wait for some seats to open up and 2) Go towards the closing time of either lunch or dinner. In both those cases you will get more prompt service and better attention overall. The longest I have waited in the bar for a seat is about 20 minutes. I really think the drinks here are some of the best that you can find in the city. The margaritas are just perfect. If you are an adventurous drinker and enjoy spicy things I would suggest you try a ""Michelada Moderna"". Along with this the restaurant has seasonal drinks on the menu that are always delicious. As for food: I really enjoy the Appetizer Sampler platter as you get to have chips & salsa, ceviche, empanadas, tacquitos, and guacamole for a really good bang for the buck. I really enjoy the ceviche at Frontera and think it is among the best I have ever had. As for other entrées you can't go wrong with any of them but for something unique get something with the great dark mole sauce they have.

Frontera Grill is hands-down my favorite Mexican restaurant and one of my favorite restaurants of all of the countries I've eaten food in. Aside from the Rick Bayless factor, the restaurant does not disappoint except for one factor. Reservations. This highly reputable restaurant does not take reservations and the lunch rush during the workweek wraps around the block at times. Now that I'm done complaining about that, I can go on to describing this insanely delicious experience.  There is nothing I love more than chips, salsa, and guacamole. At Frontera, you are greeted with the freshest made guacamole with seasonings straight from Mexico and I'm not kidding either. Mr. Bayless takes his staff once a year to Mexico to explore new fusions of seasonings and vegetables to create new dishes. For my entrée, I ordered the Flautas de Carnitas and outstanding does not do it justice. These crispy, homemade tacos were filled with pork, roasted poblano peppers, a tomato sauce with green chile, and its key ingredient: pineapple. Finally it was topped with fresh arugula, a perfect addition to the mix of flavors. The sweet and spicy contrast hit all points on the taste spectrum.

I was initially discouraged when I found out Frontera does not take reservations and when we showed up we were told the wait was about an hour and a half. Celine and I had just flown in from San Diego a few hours earlier and the airline snacks were well past worn off. Luckily the hostess gave us an option to sit at the chefs bar and the wait would be about 15 minutes. 15 minutes came up and to my surprise we were given a full table. The mens bathroom lacked toilet seat covers and I hate to be a complainer, but I feel like no one invests in toilet paper that feels any better than sandpaper. The soap left my hands feeling really dry and chalky. Not a deal breaker but could use some improvement. The real reason why I give this place 5 stars is for the service. Thomas is a class act and definitely needs to be moved up in the ranks because he is doing this business all sorts of justice. Very thorough in explaining the menu (getting down to specific details about ingredients and what particularly is in season, etc...) So Thomas if you read this, keep doing what you're doing!

I base this only on the dish I ordered and nothing else. Hence the ""Meh, I've experienced better"" rating. I love Mexican food. I am probably the most loyal to Mexican food than any other genre. Since this place has a trillion yelps already, I won't bore you with the obvious about Rick Bayless and all that. I will tell you that I am frustrated that everytime I order a vegetarian entree, I am given the most random dish as I watch all the others around me indulging in normalcy.  Just because I don't consume meat does not mean I want to have the ONLY filling of my ""vegetable enchiladas"" be collard greens and beets (with no seasoning = tastes like dirt). I've eaten a lot of vegetables, but just because this is a ""fancy"" restaurant in the Mexican scene, it doesn't mean I want to eat reject vegetables. Maybe SOMEONE actually likes beets and collard greens. If so, I don't want to eat with them. My husband LOVED his chicken tortilla soup and dish consisting of 3 small corn tortillas topped with chorizo, egg, and chicken. Seriously, why the normalcy with his meal? Why couldn't they feed him horse guts or something?  One thing I will say is that the food did taste fresh (literally, they probably pulled my collard greens and beets right out of the ground, chopped, sans washing, and stuck them into my enchilada within 15 minutes). The enchilada sauce was amazing and obviously housemade. The corn tortillas were also freshly prepared and delicious.  I'd go back, but I will definitely be ordering something that is more normal. I'd probably try XOCO first, though. It's right next door and they appear to have more normal foods-- I mean... they sell churros!

We had to wait about 2 hours at the bar, but we knew what we were in for so that was no problem.  Between us we tried blackberry mojitos, she had a margarita, and I had some vodka drink that was more like a sno cone.  The blackberry mojitos were too tart, the margarita was not great (according to my friend) and the vodka cocktail was way too sweet and syrupy. The bar has an amazing selection of tequila, but if you don't like tequila (and I don't) you're stuck with beer, wine or subpar cocktails. While waiting, we had the ceviche tasting and the queso fundido.  The ceviche was great and we both enjoyed it.  The queso fundido was just ok. Dinner is where things got REALLY disappointing.  We both wanted to try dishes from the Topolobampo menu.  My friend ordered the pork belly and I had a seafood dish with lobster and scallops in a tomatillo cream.  Both dishes were way, way too salty, almost inedibly salty.  The fat on my friend's pork belly was squishy, not crispy.  My seafood was cooked well, but again, it was so salty I really didn't enjoy it at all. $200 and 3+ hours later, we left exceptionally disappointed.  I have no reason to go back for drinks, because I have had better many, many places.  I have no interest in waiting 2+ hours for salty nasty dinner.  I love ceviche, but that's not a reason to pay the cab fare, fight the crowd, and suffer through crappy drinks.

When I planned a trip to chicago, it was the first place I thought of eating and while I'm often skeptical of high-end Mexican, I assumed all of the hype had to be pretty well deserved. However, our meal was passably tasty and hardly revolutionary.  We started with chips, guac, and salsa. The guac was delicious, though about as good as any place that makes decent guac. Chips were too thick and lacked salt. Next, we had the tamal de birria. The tamal was very moist and had a nice corn flavor; the goat was quite goat-y. Good, but an acquired taste, and more gamy than other goat dishes. Next up, the salmon tartar with a peanut/plantain chip sauce. This dish had a distinctly odd, bordering on unpleasant flavor. The peanut sauced masked the salmon taste and I couldn't find the texture of the plantain chips.  We also ordered the sopes rancheros, with short ribs. Delicious though not transcendent. The sopes were well crisped and the short ribs full of flavor. Probably the best dish of the night. Finally, we ordered the maple pork tacos. I swore I was eating chicken! We even asked the waiter, who laughed and insisted we were eating pork. He also said that people ask him this all the time. I'd say if people think your pork is chicken, you have a problem! I like my pork to taste like pork, thank you. Also, no hint at all of maple flavor.  Perhaps I'm being too harsh. All in all, the meal was reasonably good with a few great moments.

I was also disappointed that when the manager gave us the bill all he said was ""I didn't charge you for the enchiladas."" duh I didn't eat them why would you charge me? What I wish he had done was ask for feedback why didn't I like them or say hey I tried them you were right the sauce was entirely made of salt not black beans something to show that they actually gave a damn about their guests experience. Also just another suggestion even if a guest is running towards the door with their screaming child, or if you don't agree with them that anything was wrong with the dish, make them an item they can take with them so they have an enjoyable last memory of the place.  Positives  I really enjoyed the guacamole and the sopes, I know I said the sopes were too salty but they were very delicious, our son also loved them! The red salsa was good, for children, it was so mild that our 18 month old son was drinking it! Sadly they didn't sell it in a jar we really wanted to buy some for him. My wife ordered the mole which has been One of the dishes by Rick bayless that I've wanted to try for the last 10-13 years and wow was it good!! Thankfully it was too much food for my wife to eat so I was able to have most of it! Perfection! So well balanced, I could eat that over and over again and not get bored! My favorite aspect was that unlike so many moles, no flavors over powered the dish. I've had too many moles where the flavors are so disconnected that you can identify all 21 ingredients and I've had others where one spice over powered the whole dish, however this mole was perfect!

I really appreciated that he tried to help me find an appropriate jarred salsa for our son.  Over all I'm very happy I experienced Frontera grill, and had it been any other restaurant I probably would've been overjoyed and given it 4-5 stars. However since I was expecting more and know that they could've done much better, to know this just go to xoco, I will only give it 3 stars.

I asked friends who had dined in the Chicago area for restaurant recommendations and there was a consensus pick; Frontera Grill was one of THE places to dine at. When I spoke with the concierge at my hotel, he was quick to say Frontera's reservation queue runs well in advance of a month. Undeterred my bosses and I decided to test our luck on a late Tuesday night and we were able to be seated at Frontera.  1) Service - our waiter was a true gentleman and class act. He was attentive and quick to help us refine our choices. Great services overall.  2) Drinks - we all had negra modelos which is never a bad choice.  3) Food - definitely the reason we came and definitely the reason why my group and I were disappointed. Nothing about the food stood out - yes it was ""good"" but hardly worthy of the warning of a ""30 day waiting list for reservations"" and the consensus amongst my friends. I had the tacos al carbon, while the others in my group had the carne asada and pescado a la veraniega. We all agreed that the food was fine, but we didn't understand the hype surrounding the place. Maybe it was the luck of the draw or maybe Frontera's reputation has more to do with Rick Bayless than the actual quality of the food.

The drinks are sadly fantastic.  I think I was drunk off of 2, but I just kept drinking away.  My suggestion: don't make an effort to try every drink on the menu, like I did.  Not only will you be drunk and still hungry, but you will be broke. The food: a hazy experience.  That's because by the time I finally ate it, It was like 8 pm, around 3 hours after we had arrived.  I had the Swordfish, it was amazing.  So was the rest of the food.

Twenty minutes later, I approached the waiter and asked about the status of our food. He said he put in our order right away and had no control over the kitchen.

Since we had already been at lunch for an hour before receiving our entrees, it did not seem worthwhile to ask them to re-cook our dishes. Due to that, most of us left our food untouched.

Since there wasn't even room at the bar at Frontera, we decided to get a ""snack"" at Bayless' new Mexican street food restaurant next door, XOCO, while we waited.  (see my review on XOCO). An hour and a half later, our buzzer finally went off for our table at Frontera Grill. It was a lovely evening, so I was pleased to get a table on the patio. We started off with their special Mezcal margarita (YUM!) and ordered an array of items... Tostaditas (tortilla chips with 2 kinds of salsa) - the chips were good, but there was nothing special about the salsas. They tasted surprisingly similar and kind of watered down. If a restaurant is going to charge for chips and salsa, it should taste better than this. Scallop Ceviche  - this ceviche really highlighted the plumpness and sweetness of the scallops. The melon toned down the acidity of the ceviche, making it more soft and elegant, but there was still enough heat to give it a kick. Tamal de Elote (sweet corn tamales) - the fresh corn flavor was so sweet and vibrant in the tamales. The soft cheese added a slight savoriness, but this dish could have easily been a nice dessert.  Enchiladas de Mole Poblano (chicken enchiladas with mole) -  I've been dying to try this mole ever since I saw Bayless make it on Top Chef Masters. And I'm happy to report that the mole was outstanding...slightly sweet with lots of heat, tang, earthiness, and depth. Unfortunately it couldn't make up for the dry, overcooked chicken, which was exacerbated by the dense, chewy tortillas. I did enjoy the side of black beans though - tasted like refried black beans, only much more savory and delectable.   I had REALLY high expectations for Frontera Grill (perhaps maybe too high). Although the food was good, it wasn't at the level I had expected...and definitely not worth waiting over an hour for. Way too much hype.

2010-08-25,5.0,"In a complete food coma right now after my first experience with this restaurant.  You don't have to take this review with a grain of salt: I didn't have any preconceptions because I've never seen Rick Bayless on any of those competition shows and find him to be a bland tv personae and while I love food but am not a foodie.  Anyway don't bother with reservations: there is a bar with some of the tastiest cocktails I've had in many years there where you can happily wait with everyone else.  We were quoted a 2 hour wait, but we're seated much sooner in a primo 4 top on the sidewalk patio.  We couldn't believe our luck.   As I said treat yourself to a cocktail: the blueberry mojito or the summertime margarita with the cucumber juice were both original and exciting, and more importantly perfectly balanced delicious drinks.  This restaurant's forte is clearly presenting fresh ingredients, and always making each dish- whether its the side scoop of rice, or the dash of sauce accompanying a relleno-and giving it a twist, a nuance, that makes each dish's flavor complex.  You could taste the fresh corn in the tortilla, the different smoked flavor in each peice of meat, and the ceviche we sampled was the best fish experience I've ever had.  Not everything was outrageously good- my rellenos were a little bit of a let down- but everything was fresh, and everything had a curious flavor if you looked for it.  The restaurant experience was everything you want for a special occassion.  The restaurant is full of people of all types, the servers are friendly and knowledgeable, and they clearly stress a pretension-free atmosphere from the staff. That's so key: I can't stand being talked down to by a server esp. since I used to be one.  We were so relaxed we let the server upsell us all over, but nothing we tasted wasn't worth the experience.  Even the guacamole was creamy and subtley different... It was a destination restaurant that lived up to a certain level of hype.  We really were happy with a group because we shared our food all around and got to try a hundred different flavors which made the experience much richer.  I don't think I'd go back with just my partner- definitely with a group who you can talk and laugh with while you wait for a table.  It was a fun night, and no area was wanting: great service, and really fun good food.",0.999,0.708,0.262,0.03,0.5095583160800553

2010-08-23,4.0,"Food: 5 stars Service: 3 stars Value: 3 stars We out-of-towners came in for a Friday lunch with no reservations after seeing Rick Bayless on Top Chef Masters.  When we mentioned that we were heading to Frontera with no reservations to our hotel concierge - they laughed in our face... but we still persevered and I'm glad that we did. We were told we would have a 1.5 hour wait for a table, so we started to hover around seats at the bar and wait for people to leave.  We lucked out and bet on the right folks - because we were seated 15 minutes later.  Not bad since there were only three of us.  I would highly recommend this on a weekday, but am guessing this is a no-go on the weekends. Minus some stale chips we got with our chips/salsa/guac - the food was 5 stars all the way.  I'm surprised the chips/salsa aren't included given how small the salsa is.  We shared the appetizer platter (quesadillas, ceviche, taquitos, guac) - which is huge, the gulf shrimp, and the carne asada ribeye.  It was all excellent. Service was kind of dicey.  Granted, the restaurant was filled to capacity (as was the bar) - but it took us 30 minutes to get our first round of drinks.  After sweating profusely from our 15 block walk in 95 degree weather and intense humidity - we needed something refreshing and every minute seemed like forever.  It was even harder to get a second round order of drinks in.  Same with the food - this place is just slooooooow. This place is pretty spendy for fancy Mexican food.  I think it's worth it - because it tasted great and the restaurant has a great vibe, but I would have been sorely disappointed if I had waited 2 or 3 months to get a reservation.  It's the kind of place, where as a tourist - I'm glad I went once to check it off my list, but I'll try another place the next time I'm in Chicago.",0.9912,0.794,0.159,0.047,0.5871632653061225

I have been here twice and enjoyed most items I've had.  For appetizers, I highly recommend the mini sopes.  They were shredded beef in tomatoes.  I know his menu changes, so they may not always be there, but get them if they are.  I also got the queso fundido which I thought was great.  I don't recommend the tamales at all (mine were chorizo and bacon with some sauce on it).  I also don't recommend the flautas. My entres were a steak dinner and duck tacos.  I didn't not enjoy the tacos so much (except for the handmade tortillas...awesome).  The steak was good though.  Most sides are extra...like rice for example. For desert, I've had the flans and they are always good.  I think that is a can't miss here and I highly recommend it. Overall, I took off a star for a couple reasons.  One, the food is not amazing enough for the wait or price.  I completely love Rick's show and books.  I cook from them and trust them over any other book, but the restaurant is different.  Go in knowing that he uses authentic flavors and ingredients, but twists the dishes a bit.  I completely respect that he makes original dishes, but it may surprise those looking for the flavors they are used to.",0.9942,0.77,0.214,0.016,0.5319166666666666

It definitely is MUCH better Mexican food than anywhere else I've ever tried, including Mexico, and I really appreciate that Bayless aims for sustainability. I've only been here twice but both times really loved it and had a fabulous meal - the wait time is fine if you're aware of it ahead of time and there are plenty of places nearby to spend your wait time having a pre-dinner cocktail! My favorite things at Frontera are the tamales, the margaritas (YUM!), the mole sauce, and the DESSERTS - just when I think I'm completely stuffed I can always find room for their desserts.",0.9788,0.789,0.211,0.0,0.525
2010-08-19,3.0,"What?! 3 stars? For Frontera?? You do realize that this is Rick Bayless' restaurant. You might remember him from winning Top Chef Masters? Do you see all of the 4 & 5 star reviews? 3 stars? Are you crazy?  No, I am not crazy. But here are a few things:  -I admit to not having the sophisticated tastes of a food critic  -Nor do I have an unlimited budget  -I loved XOCO, so it's not like I'm a Bayless hater.  But I swore an oath when I started Yelping that I would always keep it real. No matter how unpopular that may be.  You will wait. Sorry folks. Don't take away stars or be all sour puss about your experience because you had to wait. My friend and I ended up waiting for an hour (originally told 1 1/2-2 hours) and we had a few drinks at the bar and got acquainted with some guacamole and queso. Were we shocked that we had to wait? No. It comes with the territory. So get over it.  Drinks were good. I was a little envious of my friend as she ordered the fancy shmancy Topolo marg that comes in a dainty margarita glass. I went with the standard gold marg and that was unceremoniously poured from a pre-made mix behind the bar. That was disappointing. I should've just brought my own Jose Cuervo mix from Jewel and saved myself a few extra bucks.  Guac was good. No real heat, but it was scarfed down in between bits of conversation. The queso was thick and gooey, served with warm corn tortillas for dipping. We both admitted that we are not corn tortilla fans, but these were little soft pillows of perfection for cheesy goodness to rest on.  After we were halfway through the 2nd drink, our buzzer went off and we shrieked with delight and closed out the tab. Our server seemed a little frazzled. We're pretty witty gals and kept trying to engage him in banter. He wasn't having it. Ok, ok, I guess you have a job to do. We ordered the flank steak and the Poc Chuc de Puerco (pork shoulder). The pork was seasoned really well and the black bean soup had some nice heat/seasoning to it.  We ate. It was good. We enjoyed our meal. But I couldn't help but feel underwhelmed. Granted, there is a lot of hype surrounding this place, so you walk in expecting to be wowed and I just wasn't. Maybe high-end Mexican food isn't my cup of tea, but for the cost of what you're getting, I felt disappointed.  The restaurant is gorgeous and hundreds of positive Yelp reviews speak volumes.

2010-08-19,5.0,"Like Rick Bayless needs my plug... I've eaten here maybe six times over the past dozen or so years, dinners, brunches (people who fear Frontera will be too expensive might want to try brunch--it can be pretty reasonable), and most recently, lunch. This time, after calling at 10 am and failing to be granted a reservation, we walked right in and were seated without a wait, which was a nice surprise. The room is inviting with its lively paintings, costumes and giant carvings; the server was gracious; and the food was muy fabuloso. We had the house ceviche, queso fundido de pollo, enchiladas mole de poblano, and tamal en mole amarillo. I think I'm in love with mole amarillo (less so in love with the ricotta-filled tamal--just a tad sweeter than I was expecting)--complex, earthy, and great on the grilled squash that was tucked beneath the tamal.  I really love that Rick Bayless cares about gardens and that some home-grown produce makes it into the dishes. It's a guarantee that you're not going to get a bland, mealy hothouse tomato in August (which has happened to me at many other restaurants, including a couple of expensive ones). The margaritas are excellent (I favor the mescal), and this time I ordered their michelada. It was light, refreshing and huge, and the chipotle salt on the rim adds a nice level of heat. One tiny suggestion I think they should take--buy some straws that are as deep as the glass. I kept having to fish mine out of my drink. It was expensive, but a treat.",0.9793,0.834,0.151,0.016,0.6503968253968252

Instead of ordering an entree my friend and I just ordered a bunch of small plates and for the most part, I love everything.  My favorite part about my visit were the drinks and by drinks I really mean Tequila shots and a shit ton of Margaritas.  I left sufficiently sated and drunk.  I recommend Frontera Grill for anyone that likes good quality Mexican food.",0.9845,0.716,0.238,0.046,0.6171031746031747

I waited patiently, with the most tasty mojito in-hand, ready to pounce on the next open seat (this is a bigger feat than you might imagine, when waiting among fanny-pack wearing tourists and pushy broads with designer handbags). I didn't have to wait long, and when I got to sit down, I wanted to cackle and shout out ""haha, suckas!"" to the others waiting behind me. On to the meal. I ordered the Pato en Mole Verde de Cacahuate (yes I copied and pasted that shit). Holy effing crap. Hands down the best beans I've ever had (who knew they could be so different when they're 3 times the cost?) - and the duck breast was sheer heaven. The homemade tortillas were the icing on the cake, as they were warm, buttery, and damn tasty dipped in the sauce and wrapped around chunks of food. I somehow ate the entire plate (what can I say, my hotel didn't have a fridge!), and was definitely in a food coma for the rest of the afternoon. Definitely the best meal I had while I was in town.

2010-08-15,5.0,"Rick Bayless is a genius as his dishes are beautiful and delicious. I am typically not a fan of chicken mole, as I find it too spicy, bitter, and unpleasant to look at, but Frontera's chicken mole enchiladas have changed my mind completely. The flavor is complex, subtle, and yet absolutely wonderful that you just want to keep eating it. On the first bite I was a little ""huh?"" and then by the 2nd or 3rd bite I found a strange craving for more coming over me. I liked sampling all my family members dishes as well but I held a special place for the mole.  The Trio, Trio, Trio is also excellent and a great start to the whole meal. It was another hot summer day and dipping into that guacamole was heavenly. I'm not usually a cilantro fan either(I know, why eat Mexican then?) but maybe they use really good cilantro or know how to do just the right proportions, but anything with cilantro was just fine. I loved every bite and we had to get more chips too because they were just perfect with it. We even drank the left over juices in the cups. Until dessert... Flan!!! FLAN!!! Blackberries and flan btw is genius, and having two flavors was nice. We also had the ice cream(rasberry and fig) with a side of chocolate dipping action going on. Ohh, rasberry and choco heaven~ The fig was good too but I have a special place in my tummy for rasberry so that disappeared faster...  Excellent service and we were seated fairly quickly though you may want to send someone ahead and while looking for parking you'll arrive just in time to sit down. The wheelchair accessibility was good for me though and had a nice ramp going to the bar but the door was a bit heavy for me. The staff was eager to open doors for me though when I had trouble.

The second margarita convinced me that I was willing to try the pork in habanero flavored sauce and I'm glad I did because it was some of the best pork I'd ever eaten.  The sauce was flavorful without being scary-hot.  It really was perfect.  I tried the pork ribs (a daily special) and the flank steak, and I was equally impressed with both, and with the sides.   Everything just worked.  From the drinks and appetizers through the entrees to the desserts and coffee, everything was just right.  The service was exactly the sort of unobtrusive care I like best.  Our waiter and several other staff members were always nearby but never in our faces.  We never had to ask for anything twice and in fact we rarely had to ask at all for things like refills.  Why did I wait a dozen years to come back?  Hard to say.  But I know I'll be going back for my birthday; I already have the reservation.  Believe me when I tell you that's one of the highest compliments I can pay a restaurant.  I'm getting too old to waste my birthdays on just anyplace.",0.9967,0.779,0.198,0.023,0.45211770211770214

However, the good service ended there. It took a good ten minutes before we even saw a server. The restaurant was noisy, kids were screaming, strollers were parked everywhere.  Here's the breakdown of my meal. To say it was mediocre would be a gross understatement.  Drink - Top Shelf Margarita - very sweet and weak, I think Chile's makes a better drink.  Appetizer - Sampler Platter - As most people mentioned, the ceviche was very good. I wish I had just the ceviche for my meal. The ""mini quesadillas"" were balls of mozzarella deep fried. The taquitos were a nonevent, beef in a deep fried shell. And then we got about 2 tablespoons of guacamole.  Dinner - Flank Steak Tacos - This was probably the worst thing I've eaten in a restaurant. It appeared that the meat was cut against the grain, making the meat so chewy it was inedible. I tried to politely nibble, but should have made a stand and sent it back. I left the restaurant still hungry.  The other entrees at our table were the tamale and chicken enchiladas. The tamale was pure mush and the enchiladas were dry and uneventful. The mole was pretty good though.  So, in all it was just a really disappointing meal. We went in with such anticipation and left with nothing endearing about our meal. We really wanted to like it.

Arrived here after hearing about this restaurant on a guided tour- they told us it was voted one of the best restaurants in the US.  Instead of going our originally planned restaurant, we decided to head here the following night- and we were well aware of the wait time, so we came prepared!   The hostess took our name, indicating it was a 3 o 3.5 hour wait time, and she even took our phone number and said she would call before our table was free, so we deicded to (as we had planned) hit up a bar or two in the meantime, which honestly was the most FABULOUS idea ever!!!  Time flew so quickly! Arrived here, and then was seated almost immediately, by some friendly waiters in a booth near the bar. After scoping out the menu, we ordered drinks.  I ordered a mojito - which turned out fabulous, the boys ordered Chupacabra cerveza, and the other girls wine.  Please note, although Frontera serves Rum, and Tequila, they do not have bacardi, grey goose, etc.  I think they have Latin American/Mexican brands.  So if you are looking for your fave boozy, dont count on it.  That being said- the drinks were still really good.  I really liked the muddled mint in my drink- made it extremely refreshing!   As an appetizer, part of the group ordered the queso fundida (cheese with chorizo), the trio trio trio (three types of ceviche, which I did not try), and sopes rancheros.  The waiter brought a SUPER hot habanero salsa along out with our food- so hot that I could only use a few drops, and Im the type who survives off of sriracha and anything spicy!  The best thing was that it actually tasted GOOD!  The sopes were perfectly formed, and despite the sauce around it, the maza shell was not soggy and retained its shape!  Genius!!!! The queso was the perfect amount of cheesy goodness (whenever its cheesy, its always goodness), and was served in a hot skillet with some chips.  Perfectly cooked and just beyond amazing! For dinner, we ordered the flank steak (medium-well, even though I wanted it medium, but my friend wanted it a little more cooked), along with a side of black beans and rice.  WOW! Those black beans were.. to say the least.. of the hook!!! What great flavor they had!  The rice was good, and the flank steak was mouth wateringly fabulous!  It came with a corn tamale which was also really great and not overly sweet like some restaurants make it.   Other orders on my table: pork loin- which was SO good!, the chicken tacos, which seemed ok; however, the guacamole it came with was phenomenal!   For dessert, Raspberry sorbet, which really tasted like a fruitroll up, haha!  But still tasted good and twas definitely a palate pleaser,   Service was great- they brought us extra hot salsa without us even asking.  They were courteous and extremely patient with us while we decided to order :)   On a side note- another customer in the bathroom was really rude, and a lady who was restocking stuff in the bathroom was gracious enough to apologize on her behalf.  That is called courtesy!   We ate our food so happily! Because it was totally living up to the hype for once, which honestly is a rarity.  We expected something a lot less than what we heard, but obviously we were wrong and I would totally make a trip back there again.",0.9996,0.726,0.249,0.026,0.6375000000000001

After realizing that reservations are made 3 months in advance and booked up solid, we waited 2 hours and finally made it to a nice spot outside of Frontera (even the fact that it was 9pm by then). Just be wary trying to ""walk-in"" for dinner here. We started off with the chips and salsa ($3 is a good value, but I'd pass here, the salsas are very normal bottle water like). Then came the Shredded Beef over Corn boats with avocado and a out of control sauce. I would order 3 more orders of this. Then the trio ceviche (tuna with mango, scallops, and calamari). All three were light, well seasoned, and perfect. I only wish I ordered bowls of it. Lastly came the enchilada mole. Ok, so I may not be a Mexican expert, but I grew up in California, and have had my fair share of Mexican food. I found the mole to be a bit underseasoned, and not as robust as I would expect a mole that has been cooking for hours. The chicken seemed a bit dried out, actually, a lot dried out. I found the beans to actually be the best part of the dish. Seriously I was a bit underwhelmed by the dish.

Came with really amazing guacamole. Entrees: - Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena: I guess my expectations were too high for this dish. i thought the meat was too tough and chewy for the $30 price tag. The flavor of the spices was good but because the meat was bad it ruined the flavor as well. - Enchiladas de Mole Poblano: His famed mole sauce is probably the best mole I've had...even better then mole I've had in mexico.

Tasting them wasn't much help, as they were all wonderful, but I suppose if I were only allowed one, I'd choose the Coctel de Atun Tropical, a raw tuna with dressed avocado and mango. While the raw tuna and avocado is nothing new, the seasoning for the mango (salsa?) and avocado (guac-like) was perfect. I'll admit, I could have done without the pork flautas; the wrapping was thicker and tougher than I would have liked, and while the meat was good, it wasn't great. But all was forgiven when I tried my Queso Fundido de Costilla. The cheese tasted incredibly fresh, and was well supported by the pork and vegetables.

His personality is one of the reasons I was so excited to try Frontera, and after tasting the goods, I felt like I had won the lottery.  The bf and I were moving from Anchorage to DC, and decided to make a trip of it and stop in Chicago for a few days.  We planned ahead and went to Frontera 2 hours before we wanted to sit down for dinner, that way, by the time they were ready for us, we were ready to eat.  It was already bustling when we put in our name.  The hostess said it would be about 2 1/2 hours, and we said no problem, we'll be at Maggiano's down the street!  We had a little wine and watched some baseball at the bar, the hours flew by, and back we were at Frontera with them ready to seat us. First off, drinks are to die.  Do yourself a favor and get one of their signature margaritas.  If you like tart and sweet, the Blue Agave margarita is the way to go.  The best I've ever had (and I've sampled my share of margaritas!).  None of that sugary mix nonsense.  This is just tequila and lime juice with a few tasty extras.  Delish. For an appetizer we ordered the ceviche trio.  I don't even know what fishes were in what dishes.  What I do know is that it was a burst of flavor in my mouth that has been hard to beat since my Frontera ceviche experience.  The texture of the seafood was perfect--it was ice cold without being frozen, and the citrus brought out a great flavor to the fish.  Yum! For entrees, I had a chicken dish with red pepper sauce and the bf had duck with Bayless' famous black mole sauce.  Although my dish was delicious, I had serious food envy for that duck dish.  The mole sauce was truly an astounding thing to eat, and I can understand why it took Bayless 20 years to master it.  The depth of flavor was just crazy good; I can still remember how it tastes.  If you go to Frontera, don't be distracted by other appealing dishes.  If it has the black mole sauce, go tunnel vision and get it. We DID have to send the duck dish back for another one, because the first one was for some reason lukewarm.  However, they brought a fresh, hot one out within minutes so I won't hold it against them by deducting a star.

I was most disapointed in the gucamole that took over 30 minutes to get to our table and I found it lacking in taste and the texture was a little too thick for my liking.  I would be willing to give Frontera another try and would love to check out XOCO, but let's just say I am not exactly chomping at the bit to go back.",0.9878,0.798,0.175,0.028,0.58

Juan then came back 2 minutes later and announced that the swordfish ahd been replaced by the halibut.  After I expressed surprise since he had just described the swordfish, he said, ""This is a restaurant and that's the way things go."" So, then the water torture began.  ""Your entrees should be right out,"" we were told numerous times.  Well, they certainly should.  After 45 minutes my date left the the restaurant.  I called for the check and Juan said the manager would be right over.  The last thing I saw was the buffoon-like manager marching into the kitchen.

She recommended drink made with passion fruit, champagne, sugar and wheat beer, it was delicious; of course, I wouldn't dare skipping a good Mijito and Margarita (note, this wasn't a liquid lunch...). Started off with the Guacamole, it was very fresh, chunky and nicely seasoned; shared an order of Brazo de Indio, which is a vegetarian tamal, filled with black beans, egg & pumpkinseeds, topped with a roasted tomato sauce. Tasty but could use a bit more flavor IMHO.   I got the Enchiladas de Huveo con Bistec, it was spicy steak & eggs in tomato-serrano chile sauce in fresh-baked corn tortillas; topped with hand-made Indian Jack cheese.

Since we've watched Mr. Bayless cook food on PBS for a while, and it was reported that he had cooked for the President at a state dinner earlier that week, our expectations were very high. We cabbed it down and arrived around 7:30 p.m. -- prime dinner time. As expected, the lady behind the counter took our name down and said it would be two and a half hours before we'd be seated. Just come back in two hours, she said. So, we decided to walk around for a while and come back and get drinks at the bar. After 45 minutes, we checked back in, received a buzzer and went to the bar (which was still full). To our surprise, the buzzer went off after only 15 minutes. So, the actual wait was only around one hour. Good thing, since we were told to come back in two hours?? Anyway, onto the food. The margaritas were excellent (the blue agave was superb, the topolo was ok). The side dishes (we had the sopes and the ceviche) were fantastic. The main course was also wonderful (I had the asada brava - flank steak with a sweet corn tamale).  Given all the expectations, it was difficult to see how the restaurant could have lived up to the hype, but it certainly did. the one thing I would say is that the portions (both food and drink) could have been just a tad bigger for the price.

2010-05-18,5.0,"Rick Bayless is amazing.  I'd follow him anywhere around the world to eat his food.  He's one of the most decorated and revered chefs in America for a few simple reasons:  He cooks authentic, ethnic food from the soul, without pretension, and with it expresses his honest devotion to the culture, history, and ingredients that define Oaxacan food. We arrived early afternoon with party of four.  We had hoped to score a late reservation for Frontera or Topolobampo but understood it would be difficult.  The door staff advised us to wait in line (starting at 415) to try for an early evening seating.  We waited, were given a 640 sit-down time, and were seated promptly as promised.  The restaurant saves half the seats for walk-up clients (much more forgiving than most places) and most times can squeeze you in the same night. The service was wonderful.  The full staff is attentive, prompt, friendly, and helpful in decoding the complexities of the monthly-rotating Oaxacan menu.  The drinks are strong.  Way strong.  I recommend the traditional Mojito (with Tequila). Rick and his staff present a variety of ceviche, small plate, and large plate offerings.  We ordered a few selections from each part of the menu and were amazed at the consistency, depth of flavor, diversity of ingredients, execution of technique, and inspiration in each dish.  The food, all the food, was simply amazing. You may expect that Rick, like most celebrichefs,  coasts by on mediocre food to fund his burgeoning TV, cookware, cookbook, and all-in-one margarita machine empire.  You'd be, fortunately for all, incorrect.  Rick and his restaurants are no 'crap-serving, overpriced, slow-service, uninspired, taco bell-knockoff, Bobby Flay crap storm'.  His food is traditional to the T---he's lived there, loves the land, and uses it to inspire his creations.

The weekend I was in town, It just made sense to brave the notoriously horrendous hordes of people and get fed by the man himself. When we showed up we were told it would be 2 hours but that we should come back in an hour and check in. So after leaving our name and milling about for a bit., we returned as instructed and they sat us in about 15 minutes (so our actual wait time was 1 hour and 15). The whole getting seated bit was as annoying as expected, so steel yourself if you want to try Frontera out. I ordered the quesadillas capitalinas, the tortas, and the platanos con crema. ALL WERE DELICIOUS. I had never heard of the tortas -- I actually asked if they were a sandwich (which they're not). Instead, they were these cheese croquettes, mixed with sweet corn, rolled in greens, breaded and then fried. They were served with a red pepper sauce and fresh greens on top. My dining companions ordered the tacos (with portobello mushrooms) and the carne asada. Happily, they make a specialty cooler (agua del dia) for those of us who don't do well with the spirits. The evening I went, it was this refreshing cucumber-lime thing, that was a perfect companion for my meal. I'd love to try and do it again when I'm in town next, although I have to confess that their reservation policy and the wait for walk-ins bumps them down from a 5-star experience for me.

2010-04-22,3.0,"Just to preface this review I loved my dish, I ordered the fried ricotta balls in marinara and it was delectable. I thought my boyfriend's Mole dish was ok, I mean it wasn't the best mole I have ever had, but I definitely would not mind eating it if someone gave it to me.  I was not a fan of their appetizer taster called the Entremes Surtido. I really only liked one thing on the whole platter- the tangy ceviche tostadas, everything else was slightly bland.  I watched top chef masters religiously, so I obviously came here with pretty high expectations...  Our waiter wasn't very nice and when we asked him if we could take a picture with Rick Bayless he said he can't ask, but if we really wanted to we could ask ourselves, but how were we supposed to do that? Go into the kitchen and find him ourselves?  Sucks. But that is not the reason why I didn't give Frontera 4 or 5 stars.  It's really just because the food wasn't that great.  I heard that his higher-end restaurant which can be found right next to Frontera, Topolobampo, is amazing.

We started with a couple Spring Green Bloody Marys (WOW - we even make these at home, they're so good) and the sunfish ceviche appetizer. Just divine, would definitely order that again, A++. For my brunch entree I had the skirt steak tacos - the beans on the side were fantastic, with a smoked pork taste. The steak and tortillas were nice but I'd probably try something else next time, it was good but didn't really ""shake my soda"", as they say. The guy had chicken enchiladas in a mole poblano, it was very filling and definitely rocked his world.

I would fly from NY to Chicago just to eat here.  There is no question that this is THE BEST mexican food that we have ever eaten and we eat out alot! We had a 9:30pm reservation that one month ago.  We arrived at 9:10pm and our table was already available.   We started off with 2 margaritas.  R had the Blue Agave and I had the Mezcal which was STRONG!   Then Rob had the Mexican craft beer which was delicious.   As a wise man once said, life is too short to drink light beer. For appetizers we had the chips, salsa and guac.  There were 2 types of salsa - a green one and a spicy smokey red one.  I enjoyed all of them, but given that they give you salsa with the other apps and the entrees and chips came with the ceviche, I would not order the chips, salsa and guac next time. In addition to the above, (we have to gorge because how often do you get to eat such amazing food), we had the ceviche trio and the gorditas carnitas.  The trio was good, tasty and tart while the gorditas WAS AMAZING.  Probably one of the best mexican dishes I've had (and I am salivating thinking about it now).  For entrees, we had the chicken mole which had a very unique coconut based mole sauce and very tender chicken.  R had the steak which I could not stop eating.  If we did not try R's steak, the chicken would have been my favorite dish but the steak was extremely flavorful.

After a solid 2 hours at Hub 51 and a bit of time in the Frontera bar area, we were seated.  The food was, as expected, outstanding.  We shared the Ceviche Fronteriza and the pork carnitas gorditas.  The only thing that could improve the gorditas was a healthy dollop of the green salsa our waiter placed on the table (so good).  The ceviche was light, fresh and had the fresh, briny taste of the ocean. For entrees we had the duck breast with chayote and sweet potato mash and the flank steak.  Both were very, very good.  Unfortunately, my face (including my lips) was extremely windburned from the race yesterday, so I found the chayote to be way too spicy (I love spicy foods and had my lips not been so chapped I am sure it would have been just fine for me).  The flank steak was delicious. My husband had a Michelada (beer, bloody mary mix and lime) which was great. I had a grapefruit margarita followed by a glass of zinfandel.  I'd skip the margarita next time - definitely tasty, but not heavy enough on the booze and very small for the $14 price tag. We skipped dessert as we were way too full, but the white cornmeal poundcake with blueberry salsa and maple ice cream was calling my name! The service was good.  The only reason Frontera is not 5 stars is because of the no reservations policy and the atmosphere.  Seriously, we were handed a BUZZER and asked to wait near a rack of t-shirts, cookbooks and hot sauces.  It was a little like waiting for a table at Chilis or some tourist trap.  The only other restaurant I can think of that sells t-shirts and hot sauce is Hooters...",0.9618,0.834,0.123,0.043,0.6133903133903136

During the wait we had some OK cocktails. After visiting some of the craft cocktail lounges in Chicago, I have to say that Chef Bayless needs to hire a better mixologist.  One issue that turned me off was that the margaritas are pre-mixed and iced at the bar and then shaken at the table, diluting it improperly. On to the food, the sampler platter guac good, ""quesadillas"" okay, flautas okay, the jicama salad was great. I ordered the Catfish ""Pibil"" excellent especially with habanero sauce (seemed like a Mexican boullaibaisse). One this about the food is that it uses too much of his smoked chili salt. It was interesting at first, but then got pretty boring.  I would definitely come back here to try out new dishes.

The drinks: Mezcal has been my new favorite for a while, and the Mezcal margarita lived up to my expectations (I was dreaming about it the week before we went).  My sister loved her Tamarand/Chipolte margarita and boyfriend loved his fresh grapefruit margarita and later his champagne margarita. The food: Ostiones, duck carnitas sopes, goat empanada, spicy flank steak, garlicky pork loin, and pineapple ice for dessert.  It was fabulous. (There was also a shrimp enchilada but it had cilantro so I stayed away, my sis and boyfriend enjoyed it.) The disappointment: My mom had called ahead to buy us a round of drinks, and was assured by the person she spoke with, that it would not be an issue- ""They do this all the time"". However, there were no drinks, and my mom's nice gesture went unknown to us until she excitedly asked us about it later.  When she called back to ask what happened, she did not really get more than an ""I'm sorry"" from the staff.  It is too bad that this part of it put such a damper on the meal.  I'm sure if the host had told Vinnie Chase he would have taken care of it no prob!",0.9817,0.77,0.173,0.057,0.5914321789321788
2010-04-13,3.0,"Rick, My husband and I ate at Frontera Grill this evening. We made our reservation one month ago, and were very excited for our meal. We really enjoyed our margaritas and our trio trio trio -- the kind of quality ingredients and preparation that your restaurant deserves.  We were incredibly upset with our service. Our entrees took one whole hour to come out after we had been served our appetizer. And our waiter did not check on us between the time that our appetizer was served, and our entrees were almost finished. This would have barely been ok, except that our goat entree (Tuesday night special) was much too salty. Too salty for even salt-lovers like us. We enjoy salt, but this seemed like a fatal flaw and ruined the whole dish and its complexity and thoughtfulness, which might have been the most upsetting part. Since our waiter never once checked up on us, we were frustrated that we could not even send it back for a replacement. By the time he came to our table, we were so frustrated with the meal that we just wanted to leave. We had been so excited about ordering a third drink for both of us as well as dessert, but were disgusted by the service and felt like going home.  So, we were very upset that the service was awful for your caliber of restaurant, and both of our entrees had problems. The goat was so salty that we are still reeling, two hours later. I enjoyed my flank steak, but it came out cool, which affected the texture of the meat. But the flavors were delicious though, so I shall not complain about that dish! Both of the tables on either side of us were overheard complaining about the service. It really is a shame that our server disappeared for one whole hour. Had he been attentive and made time to wait on us, we would have had a very good experience. Now, I am afraid that I do not even want to go back.  My husband and I love regional Mexican cuisine, and we are endeared by your personality both online, in print, and on television. I am afraid that your celebrity status has overshadowed the quality of Frontera Grill. It is unfortunate that the substance upon which you were lucky enough to gain recognition in the food industry has been replaced by the kind of cow call reserved for tourist hotspots, with the service to match.  I do not, of course, know you personally, but my hope was that your seemingly kind and giving personality would be matched by the quality of food and service in your establishments. I am very sad that it was not.  I feel sheepish in filling out this online form, but I wanted to bring the really poor service and so-so food to your attention - I hope that you are able to increase the diner's experience in the future, so that your good intentions and culinary experiences are preserved and not relegated to a tourist guidebook instead of a James Beard who's who.

We never felt rushed, and after sauntering out 3 plus hours later, we vowed we would be back soon. OK the business here: THE FOOD. I had extremely high expectations after watching Chef Bayless on Bravo's ""Top Chef Masters"", and was anticipating a major let-down because of all the hype surrounding the Bayless food empire in the local news lately.  We started with the shrimp and calamari ceviche, so beautifully presented in a martini glass and silver tray, both set with banana leaves. The seafood was absolutely divine, no ""fishy"" flavor, just fresh and light-tasting, lime, red onion and microgreens. It makes every other ceviche I have ever had taste like swill!!! Next app was the Queso Fundido Clasico, with house-made chorizo (YUM), green peppers. onions and homemade torillas. So drippy and oily but damn flavorful. My husband wanted to lick the plate, but we refrained. :P Our entrees were the mushroom and corn vegetarian plate with sunflower shoot salad and the duck breast with Oaxacan mole and a dark green (I think it was Swiss chard or kale). I ordered my duck cooked a little longer than normal - the waiter said it was usually medium-rare, and I asked for medium) and it was perfect. The sauce was complex, subtle, but enriching everything....I was expecting a spicy, knock-out, overpowering sauce, but I was completely floored and mistaken! The greens weren't at all bitter, and the vegetarian entree was so inventive and surprising. Who would have thought that you would find sesame and pumpkin seeds in this kind of cuisine???? For dessert, we had a wonderful bread pudding topped with a carjeta (goat's milk) ice cream and a piece of chocolate pecan pie with impossibly flaky crust and Kahlua whipped cream. Speaking as a Southern girl who knows her way around pecan pie, it's simply not fair that a Yankee Mexican restaurant in Chicago should have the best pecan pie I've ever tasted. If you think that Mexican food is all about some mystery meat wrapped in a tortilla and disguised with cheese, then you need to visit Frontera.

2010-03-05,4.0,"This was a great restaurant experience.  I was glad to try a Rick Bayless restaurant (though I never heard of him before this Chicago visit). MENU DETAIL: Jugo del Dia, or their fruit juice of the day REC: Absolutely delicious, fresh, and a light flavorful mix of pineapple and coconut juices (normally I drink my drink throughout the meal but it was SO delicious I drink it all in 5 minutes).  They could have given you a little more though. Ceviche Trios MENU DETAIL: Ceviche Fronterizo (Hawaiian sunfish), Ceviche de Atun (Ahi tuna), and Ceviche Yucateco (shrimp and calamari) REC: Their tuna ceviche was the best, in this apricoty sauce with a dusting of crushed almonds.  Their Yucateco of shrimp and calamari was not very good, a huge shrimp (not cut up at all) and huge calamari- they could have done a better job chopping it up which is the point of ceviche.  The torilla chips were just OK, a little too hard.  They gave us free salsa with tortilla chips and the salsa was good (hearty, ground green and red salsas).  For the main course, we split an entree and a main dish: Sopes Rancheros: MENU DETAIL: ""crispy corn masa boats with savory shredded beef, roasted tomatoes, avocado and homemade fresh cheese""-  REC: Absolutely delicious, the BEST thing we ate ALL NIGHT!!  Little ground corn tortilla cups filled with this delicious stewed pork (great flavor) piled high, topped with a chunk of avocado and a sprinkling of cheese.  There were 5 of these cups all laid on top of this rich, tomato and red pepper sauce/stew- absolutely delicious.  Everything was nicely flavored and seasoned, and the perfect little morsels, combined together- an explosion of flavor in your mouth!! Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena:  MENU DETAIL""Creekstone Natural Black Angus rib steak, marinated in spicy red chile and wood- grilled, served with black beans, sweet plantains with sour cream, and guacamole""-  REC: The beef was a nice big chunk of good-quality beef, perfectly done medium, the spice rub was OK.  The beans and guacamole were just OK too- just tasted like other restaurants', nothing special.  The plantains were delicious though, perfectly fried with the nice blend of light, milky sour cream and sprinkling of cheese. For dessert, we got their Capirotada:   MENU DETAIL: ""Mexico City lenten classic: buttery bread ""pudding"" (made without custard) infused with caramely piloncillo, red wine, figs, sour cherries, raisins, pine nuts and pecans. Pinenut crunch ice cream, red wine-jamaica sauce, sprinkling of Mexican aged cheese"" REC: This was very unique and good, tasted like a a warm, fig newton with chunks and slices of dates and figs- a great bread pudding because it was chewy and sticky on othe outside yet warm and soft on the inside.  They gave you a generous scoop of pine nut ice cream on top, you couldn't really tell the flavor, it has these crystallized chunks of sugar inside.  Worth trying because it was so unqiue and good. : Our server was super attentive and very helpful in picking out menu items, as was the bus boy who constantly topped off our water (with an extra glass).",0.9991,0.708,0.24,0.051,0.5292454212454214

2010-02-26,3.0,"For being so excited to eat at Rick Bayless's restaurant, I was impressed but I think my expectations were a little too high.  I thought the margaritas were very good but somewhat small for $11 a piece.  My wife and I had two each while we waited, luckily at the bar, for an hour and half while we waited to be seated.  The guacamole may have been the highlight of the food portion of our meal.  However, for our drinks and the guac, we spent $60 before we even sat down. I also really liked the seafood platter which consisted of 3 types of unbelievably fresh and creamy oysters.  The salsas that came with were unneeded as they oysters were great on their own.  It also came with two ceviches, a ahi tuna and a sunfish.  The ahi tuna was perfect and I think might be there most popular.  The sunfish was good but nothing to die for. For dinner, I was extremely disappointed because when I went to order the Thursday specialty at 8:30 (slow roasted Lamb in banana leaves with a sauce that sound extraordinary) I was told by our waiter that they had already sold out.  Without looking at the menu again, he said his favorite was the flank stank and I had ordered.  The flank steak was good but undercooked for medium rare and just not anything special.  Rick Bayless is known for complex flavors and I made the mistake of not looking at the menu again when I got the bad news.  That is my fault, not theirs.  My wife got the short rib app because she was already full and it tasted very good. Instead of dessert, we opted for our waiter's recommendation of trying some tequilas.  We tried a flight of some of their best tequila, which was fun and tasty.  He also brought us his two favorites to sample.  The service was a little shaky but this act and knowledge of the tequila won us back over.  The bartenders are great by the way.  All of the margaritas are shaken in front of you. All in all, I really liked the restaurant but was disappointed with what I ordered for my main course.  I can get steak at a steak house.  Next time, I will go for the mole.  It also is a little pricey for what you get, but we were both on expense accounts and did not mind the $200 check.

Our two entree selections: Enchiladas $14.75 and Duck Tacos $15 were both alright and although we could have used more tortillas and asked for them, but our server was lacking in the attentive arena. The mole sauce on the enchiladas was just , well not great.  Rick needs to take the recipe from Guelaguetza  yelp.com/biz/guelaguetza…   Our server upsold us on the guacamole, which at $7.50 for a small amount was crazy.  Don't mean to toot my own horn, but I think my guac is much better.  Both versions I make.  Finally, our server Alejandro was just absent after our food was served.  We asked for both water and tortillas and were ignored. I had to flag down another server to ask for water and he didn't even bring us any.  Alejandro finally brought water right at the end of the lunch, which of course probably could be seen as a blatant stab at service before the tip is decided.

I really liked my entree, a spicy seafood soup, but thought that the bf's entree, a grilled fish, was pretty bland, dry, and the grilled potatoes/veggies that came with it were all soggy from the sauce. Tres leches cake at the end was alright, nothing special. Basically, what Rick Bayless does well he does REALLY well. If everything was like the ceviche/seafood soup, this place would be amazing for sure...but some of the dishes are just not good and even more painful because you're paying a premium for food that is usually much more affordable.

2010-01-28,5.0,"Quite possibly THE best restaurant in Chicago!  Rick Bayless is the bomb!  I'm sure everyone has different criteria for what a great restaurant is.  For me, it's food quality, creativity, consistency, atmosphere, and ""legacy"" - its impact on its visitors.  Frontera has it all.  Frontera is a cornerstone of the great food culture with which Chicago is blessed. When you walk inside, you see two large rooms painted in warm earthtones and decorated with Mexican art.  The crowd is moderately loud, and there's Latin music playing.  It's elegant yet casual.  You'll probably see a huge line of people waiting to get a table as well.  A good sign of a great Chicago restaurant (fancy or not) is the size of the line!  To avoid the wait, try going at 5pm or 9:30pm (when real Mexicans eat haha), or hit brunch before 11am.  I usually go sit at the bar area, which also has tables and is seat-yourself (and perhaps beg someone for their table when they leave).  Though the last time I sat down in the dinner area, Bayless was at the table next to me, and Mayor Daly was in da house too! Frontera is apparently home-style dishes from various parts of Mexico, with a modern, upscale twist.  The dinner menu changes every month.  In fact, Bayless takes his staff to Mexico every summer to teach as well as to learn new recipes.  Every dish has such deep and rich flavor.  Some of the staple dishes on the menu are great - the enchiladas de mole poblano (their super famous mole), the duck breast, the pork loin with mole verde, the carne asada,   I love to try their specials.  Their brunch menu is great too, especially their tortilla soup, the pozole, and the corona azteca.  Oh yeah, don't forget the appetizers and drinks.  They make three great ceviches and many great margarita/martinis.  And perhaps the best dish is the most simple dish - guacamole!!!  I am in love with it!!  There's some special twist to it - extra citrus flavor and maybe sun-dried tomato - but it's amazing.  Can't believe I pay $8 for it haha. Can you tell I'm in love with Frontera? Maybe one restaurant which could be better is its next door, ""fine dining"" sister Topolobampo.  But why pay more and try to look stuffier when you already have such greatness next door at Frontera?",0.9969,0.8,0.196,0.004,0.5324897324897327

To top it off, (as I noticed at other places) service was slow with the group.   I've noticed this happen at many places when the tip is guaranteed.   It took 90 minutes for having lunch which downtown seems like an eternity.",0.9864,0.826,0.159,0.015,0.42972222222222217

And, the perfect size for sharing; generous but not over done. I had the swordfish with the green mole. Fantastic. It was served with zuccini and sweet potatoes, and cooked to perfection. My friend got the pork with spaghetti squash, another shining star of this delightful evening.  For dessert, he got the ice cream with caramel and I had the duo of flan. YUM YUM YUM. I really loved both of these. The caramel sauce tasted like it had chai in it...which was both unexpected and delightful. We also had coffee with our dessert, which was seriously one of the best coffees I've had in a long long time.

Called the morning of our visit and was able to secure a reservation, which from what I understand is rather hard to do...pleasant surprise.  We were greeted prompty and seated a minute or two before our actual reservation, which is always a plus. Started off with their Topolo Margarita and didn't stop until we left.  Just a really good drink without frills.  Well, except for the table-side shaking of said drink.  Goes down like water, but with the added effect of making me think I'm good-looking and strong. Appetizer of Flautas de Puerco (crispy pork tacos in adobo) which were really good.  Earthy flavors and you could actually taste the pork, which you can't say for most places.   Entrees were done very nicely.  The Mahi Mahi in a almond/chile sauce that was out of this world.  Served on a bed of spinach.  The only part of my visit that I didn't like was my entree, Tacos al Carbon.  Grilled steak with fresh tortillas, guacamole and two types of salsa.  The flavor of these was incredible, but there could not have been more than 5 or 6 ounces of steak on my plate.  I'm not a heavy eater, but this was a little thin even by my standards.   For dessert, pear upside down cake served with walnuts and vanilla buttercream iced cream.  Very good dish.  And they have one of the best coffees I've ever had from Intelligentsia.  It's a single origin coffee from Oaxaca that is so naturally sweet and complex.  It was a real treat.    Overall, an excellent meal.  On a side note, this is one of those places where you get the bill and think to yourself, ""That didn't seem like $xxx.xx worth of food"".  But that is soon forgotten and you're up a good dining experience.",0.9971,0.767,0.21,0.023,0.4746685340802988

2009-12-20,4.0,"I've read a lot about Frontera, and I was not let down. One thing to note, there seems to be a lot of overlap between this and Topolobampo. It's probably easier to get in to and a little less expensive, so you might go here first, then try the upscale if you're really hooked.  I met my Dad here for dinner one night. We came on a wintry Wednesday, and arriving at 6:15ish, were able to just get a table right away - I'm going to go out on a limb here and say this is very unusual. We started with the ceviche trio - ahi tuna, shrimp/ocotpus, and sunfish. The sunfish was the clear winner, the right balance of tangy and sweet, and a great chewy fish texture with crispy jicama made for a nice combo.  My dinner was the chile rellenos - again, being able to just get these is probably unusual. I've heard over and over again how good these are, so I would have been silly to pass it up. They turned out excellent, superb green chile flavor, battered with a fluffy, almost pancake or souffle style batter (I expected a little more of a crispy, fried-chickeny batter), one filled with white cheese, and one filled with pork picadillo. The whole thing was in a nice pool of garlic tomato broth, and perhaps the perfect complement, a very simple alfalfa (or bean) sprout salad in a vinegar dressing. So a great combination of flavors, tender, juicy pork, and outstanding chiles. Worth it.  My Dad had the braised pork shoulder, which was also very good. Tender, juicy pork, pickled and sauteed onions, good black beans, and white corn tortillas (no flour - excellent). This was pretty similar to the picadillo in the rellenos, but without as much sweetness. The kicker was a small quantity of thin habanero salsa. Our waiter warned us repeatedly about how hot this was. My dad and I both eat pretty hot food, but this really wasn't all that hot - it was, however, excellent. The right complement to the pork and beans.  I had a desert that was pretty unusual - chocolate ice in a lime/mint broth with tangerine and grapefruit segments, and pomegranate seeds. It turned out to be an amazing combo - think of the pomegranate as little chocolate chips, and the refreshing milk-free chocolate ice paired nicely with the tart broth and fruits. Very good. Dad had a pecan pie tart type thing with some ice cream - good pecan pie with chewy edges. Yay for chewy edges.  As for menu overlap - the ceviche trio is also on the menu at Topo (and I had it there too, where it was also quite good) and I also saw the duck breast mole that I enjoyed greatly at Topo making an appearance at Frontera. Perhaps the older items from Topo make their way down to Frontera and a wider audience - if that's the policy, then terrific, because the prices are more reasonable here than at Topo.  Al that said, I would totally go back. This turned out to be a tad more expensive than I had intended, but we both had deserts, which were a tad pricey. Either way, I was not let down by the hype over the restaurant in general or the chile rellenos in specific, and would very much recommend Frontera. Go on a really cold windy Wednesday for best results.",0.9976,0.838,0.151,0.01,0.6147155225726656
2009-12-17,2.0,"Some friends wanted to come visit Chicago and their itinerary was the Christkindl Market, a matinee of Banana Shpeel, and dinner at Frontera Grill.  She tried to make reservations like two weeks in advance but was told that although they were no longer taking reservations for that night that we'd be fine if we came in when they opened at five, which seemed fine.  So we get there at five o'clock and there's already a line, which is fine.  But then you get up to the host stand and it's five people in the party and it's 25 minutes to sit at a table in the bar and, she says with bitchiest laugh and something that seemed unpleasantly similar to an eyeroll, ""Like two hours *haughty grunt/sigh/bitchy laugh* for a table in the main dining room.  And it's like, even this would be fine because restaurant hosts are genetically engineered to be maximumly haughty, irritating, and delusional.  So we're told twenty five minutes and shooed away from the host stand to the corral around the bar.  Meanwhile, they're not seating anyone despite that every table in the restaurant is empty.  No explanation of, ""We start seating at such and such time,"" or anything like that.  Just stand at the bar and watch them set up what is clearly your table and keep standing there for a HALF HOUR after the table has been set up.  My friend walked over to the host stand and said there were like seven people standing around looking bored.  I suggested to my boyfriend that perhaps they were staggering seating so the servers and the kitchen didn't get overloaded.  He's in the restaurant industry and replied that they need more waiters then because any decent restaurant should be able to accommodate all of their tables being filled at once.   It's ridiculous and insulting to leave people standing like that without a word of explanation.  After that experience I think I would never return there and I probably will try to steer my guests from that place as well. So we sit down and I'm not feeling particularly hungry at the moment.  And, no thank you, I didn't want anything to drink either but our hostess ordered some vegetarian appetizers and once I had some grease in my system I mellowed out a bit.   The guacamole was pretty good.  The deep fried quesadilla things were just all right and mostly just made me crave empanadas from Buenos Aires Forever.  My favorite were the plantains with sour cream.  She also got the mushroom fundido and that was good but I wasn't sure it really did it for me.  I also liked the salsas that came with the chips.  I ordered then an Autumn Margarita, which seened like it had too many ingredients, but I ordered it anyway and it was kind of busy but sort of all right. I was assured that there would be plenty of vegetarian options because Rick Bayless's daughter is reportedly a vegetarian.  These options consisted of mushroom tacos (substitute out the beans) and some MIlanesa de Verdura thing which was basically like breaded and fried turnip slices and such with mashed beans and cabbage.  It was fine but it seemed more like a plate of side dishes without an entree.  It looks more substantial in the picture on the website but the problem isn't the amount of food on the plate, it's the fact that it's so underwhelming.  It was just kind of boring. The desserts we tried were the pecan pie, the flan duo, and Bunuelos Navidenos,  some mexican holiday pastry ice cream thing.  None of them was particularly amazing but they were all right, in the order I listed them.  The pecan pie was actually pretty good. I think I might have enjoyed everything a little better if I hadn't been so put out by the first forty minutes in the restaurant.  I mean, I would think they'd want to get people seated right away so they could have them out the door by seven o'clock.  Weird and rude is how I felt about that.",0.9966,0.785,0.148,0.067,0.5745579225842384

MmMm.  While I had their tacos, my friend had the fish of the day special - which I was informed was filled with yumminess as well. For dessert, there is always room for dessert despite how overly stuffed I was with eating all of their amazing tortillas!!  It is all in the mindset - one should always make sure that there is ALWAYS room for dessert, or else the meals just doesn't feel complete!  We had the Duo de Flanes!  This included TWO Mexican caramel flan. mMmMm!

If it didn't it was supposed to. Anyway, on a more serious note, I had been waiting a while to eat at Frontera and when the date finally arrived, I had some high expectations. I made a promise not to get the ""Margarita Effect."" It is well known how potent, and tasty the Frontera Margaritas are, and I was determined to not inhale my food in a drunken stupor. We arrived at Frontera about 10 minutes early, and were seated about 5 minutes later, and although I tried, I didn't even have enough time to order a round of margarita's from the bar, so I was well on my was to a sober evaluation of the meal. Once seated, we began the drinking, and yes, the margarita' s are as good as everyone says. For appetizers, we ordered some of the freshest Kumamoto Oysters I have ever had, three excellent tasting of ceviche, the Hicama Salad, and the Sopes Rancheros... The highly touted hicama salad was very refreshing, but forgettable compared to the other two appetizers, which were stellar. For our entree we ordered the Carne Asada (my dish) and the Steak Tacos. The carne asada was very good, but should really just be called a Ribeye with a mexican seasoning and charred finish, and an outstanding one at that... great flavor, tender, and perfectly cooked. Unfortunately, I cannot critique the steak tacos because my girlfriend didn't see the need to let me try them... so they must have been good. Overall, this is an outstanding restaurant, and I would definitely go back. I would also recommend Frontera over Topolabompo, for half the price you get the same same quality of food, in what I consider a more appropriate environment.",0.9927,0.834,0.149,0.017,0.49013513513513507
2009-11-16,3.0,"The food here is very good, but I have to say that it was definitely not worth the 3 hour wait and the hype.  Here's my take on the dishes we had. 0. Sweet fried plantains - these were the best plantains I've ever had and the best of the dishes we ordered. They had a nice crispy exterior and come with homemade sour cream and fresh cheese.  Delicious! I could have eaten 2 or 3 orders of this. 1. Guacamole - pretty good, with some sort of fresh red pepper mixed in, but it was a tad on the bland side. It could have used some salt and possibly some lemon juice. I like the guac at Qdoba as much or better.  2. Chicken taquitos - these were good, but not so different than your typical taquitos. They do come mounted on a nice little mound of guacamole which added to the value. 3.  Falda Asada ""Brava"":    spicy serrano-marinated grass fed flank steak (from Bill Kurtis's Tall Grass) with spicy salsa huevona (hand-crushed, grill-roasted tomatoes, jalapenos). Grilled knob onions and sweet corn tamales (topped with homemade sour cream and fresh cheese).  29.00   I'm not a big steak guy, but this was pretty good. To be frank though, I enjoyed the sweet corn tamales more than the steak itself. It certainly wasn't worth $29. 4.  Tacos al Carbon:  wood-grilled meat, poultry, fish or mushrooms sliced and served with roasted pepper rajas, two salsas, frijoles charros, guacamole and homemade tortillas.  16.50   We had these tacos with pineapple pork, but we could not really taste the pineapple and so I think these were fairly mediocre.  The corn tortillas that accompanied the meal were good and fresh which I enjoyed. These were probably the 3rd best part of the meal (after the plantains and the tamales).",0.9988,0.698,0.291,0.011,0.5447502903600464

To date, I've eaten here twice and each time the wait has been INSANE. It doesn't seem to matter when you show up, so make a reservation or go with an open agenda. Having said that you can usually snag a place at the bar, which I did this past Tuesday. I started with a pretty basic margarita on the rocks with salt. At the bartenders recommendation I ordered the Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena. That is, a Creekstone Natural Black Angus rib steak marinated in spicy red chile. The dish was served with black beans, sweet plantains (my favorite) and guacamole. While it probably wasn't my favorite cut of beef, the rib steak was was tender and well complimented by the sides. I liked that their beef is typically ""natural"", grass fed, and/or local. Given what we know about food, health and the environment  I feel that at this point in time every restaurant should at least offer one local item. That aside, the portions were ample and of high quality. Even though I alternated between small bites and taco making (with fresh tortillas that come with the entrées) I ended up still leaving a good amount of food on the plate. (Except for the plantains of course!)  The drinks we're awesome once again. I tried a few different versions of margarita including one with an aged tequila and another coffee version that was delightful. I highly recommend that as an after dinner drink.

So, we wanted to make reservations but after reading that they had to be made so far ahead of time, we decided to just get there a little bit early and hope to be seated early. So, on a cold, rainy Saturday morning, we took a cab from our hotel and arrived at the restaurant at 10:15AM and there was already a line of about 20 people ahead of us. We were so excited for the food.  The decor inside is cute--lots of oranges, purples and nothing too fancy. As soon as we sat down, we realized how quickly the restaurant filled up. The ambiance was ok--there was a lot of background noise-- but then again, the tables are so close to each other you can hear other couples' conversations. Our waitress seemed to have grown up in Mexico but spoke English fluently. However, she seemed overwhelmed. We asked fo hot sauce but it never got to our table.  Now, for the food... we ordered the taquitos for appetizer; I ordered the tacos al carbon with the grilled skirt steak; my husband, the egg and sausage enthusiast, got the Huevos Estilo El Bajo. The taquitos were forgettable. My husband'sdish was submerged in a green sauce and was ""sprinkled"" with the chorizo. He also said there was some pungent cheese in the dish and he honestly did not enjoy it that much. As for the tacos, however, the meat was grilled perfectly, the tortilla was amazing and again, the red hot sauce is amazing. Lastly, we ordered dessert. I never get dessert and my husband only gets flan when he does, but, we decided that we wanted to try the dessert yesterday and honestly, it was by far the best dessert we've ever had. We had the chocolate cake with brownie chunk ice cream and raspberry cream. The cake was really very very light and fluffy and not too sweet. It was absolutely delicious and everything on the plate--from the ice cream to the raspberries were just as good.  So, in summary, I would only give it 3 stars if it were just based on the appetizer and the entrees but seriously, the cake is worth an entire whole star by itself.

Got in and was surprised that there were so many people waiting to get in. We got in right away because of our reservation. Sat down and enjoyed what seemed to be a tic tac container full of nuts. We ordered a few appetizers. We were not impressed. Ordered some more appetizers thinking the others might be better. Not so much. For some reason, everytime I asked for a straw it always seemed like they were rinced off and reused because there was always water/condensation on the inside of the straw. After the third set, I asked the waitress about it and she said they were a bio-degradable type of straw so that is why it looked like that. I said no way there is water inside it and she said that they sit right next to the bar where they can get wet. I thought that was a little strange. I hate drinking out of public glasses in restaurants. Yet when I looked around, I did not notice anyone else with straws in any of their drinks. I asked for a hotter sauce than what they brought me and I end up getting charged almost 3 bucks for about an ounce of habanero sauce they called salsa. I could not believe that. If I asked for salsa then I could see getting charged for it, but this is ridiculous.  I was expecting the appetizers to be amazing and it was just average. After 4 different appetizers we decided to leave. There is no point in ordering a whole meal if the appetizers are just ok in a hyped-up restaurant as packed and supposedly famous as this one.

They were good.  One was stuffed with cheese, the other with pork.  They had enough kick and tons of flavor.  My wife had the goat, which she loved, but I found the goat meat to be too stringy.  My mother-in-law and sister-in-law had the duck and both raved about it.

2009-10-18,4.0,"MMMmmm, tasty.  When I read about Rick Bayless and his joint, I knew I had to come by here on my visit to Chicago and I was definitely not disappointed.   Hailing from California makes me somewhat of a Mexican food expert (fogs nails and shines them off on collar) so I was pretty skeptical of finding good Mex out in the Mid-West.  My girlfriend and I were told they didn't take reservations (wat.) when I called so we prayed it wouldn't be too busy when we walked in.  The place was totally packed on a Thursday night and the hostess seemed pretty efficient at getting people on the wait system, but luckily, we got a seat at the bar.   The bartender was a super cool, Harley kinda guy, and he recommended the Topolobampo margarita. My gf had a ""skinny margarita"" which was straight up tequila with limes (mistake numero dos).  Wooooo. By the time our ceviche sampler appetizer came out, we were both feeling good.  The shrimp ceviche was my favorite of all three, and really the only one I would reorder again.  The squid ceviche didn't seem very well thought out and the tuna one was just normal, nothing special.  We shared the puerca entree that was rec'd by the bartender and it was delicious.  It's since discontinued because they rotate their menu monthly but if it's on again, you should def order.  These soft, tender slices of pork came out with a chile tomatillo type of sauce. The meat was so soft, it felt like it was going to melt in my mouth.  This was some serious puerca.   Anyway, if you're in Chicago, or going to go, or want to go, you must check this place out!",0.988,0.81,0.154,0.036,0.6146997929606625
2009-10-16,5.0,"This was one of the reasons the boyfriend and I opted for our Chicago visit.  We've been wanting to try Frontera for quite a long time now, and now that we have friends living in Chicago, it seemed as the perfect excuse! I ordred the enchilda de mole poblano and sopa azteca.  The boyfriend ordered enichilda de chivo.  Our friends ordered tacos al carbon, one with the pineapple pork, the other with the portabello mushrooms.  We also ordered a side of guacamole and chips.  The chips came out with 2 additional salas, one of which was a triple chili salsa that I fell in LOVE with immediately.  I couldn't stop eating it, and may have been in danger of completely over-eating on chips alone. My soup was the first thing to come out.  OMG.  Seriously, this is one of the best soups I've ever had.  I'm a HUGE soup lover.  I could eat soup every day, and would if the boyfriend was willing to do so.  Chicken tortilla soup is one of my favorite soups, and I was completely blown away by this.  LOVED IT! Our meals came out and the mole was exactly as everyone else has described it.  Amazing. Wonderful. Perfect.  It was so good as well.  I started munching on my enchilada, and while it was perfect and so good, my mind kept wondering back to the soup.  I ended up pushing aside the last piece of my enchilada and returning to my, now cold, soup and scarfed it down.  It was cold, but still so delicious and fabulous.  Please don't think the enchilada wasn't good, it was amazing...but the soup was even more amazing in my opinion! I tried a bit of the boyfriend's enchilada de chivo and found the goat meat was definitely interesting and tasty.  I'd never had goat meat before, and found it to be a cross between a chicken and lamb.  It was quite yummy.  I tried a bit of the pineapple pork and the portabello mushroom too and they were both wonderful as well. I'm so pleased and happy with Frontera.  I'm originally from San Diego, so I'm usually really picky with my Mexican food...but this was just so fabulous and so well done.  Bravo Rick Bayless...you are definitely the Top Chef Master!",0.9986,0.738,0.25,0.011,0.6370580808080808
2009-10-15,5.0,"Holy mole! There are very few restaurants out there that actually meet the high expectations that are garnered. This is one of them. I have been a huge fan of Top Chef since the first season and this year's Top Chef Masters spin-off really had me captivated. So it was required that I had to plan a trip to Frontera Grill, the workplace of Top Chef Master champion, Rick Bayless. I had high hopes for trying some amazing Mexican cuisine from the master of Mexican food.  This place was packed for lunch. It would have been very difficult to get a table, but luckily I came solo so I was quickly seated at the bar near the kitchen. I knew I had to try a mole dish, but I had a hard time deciding on what to get as an appetizer. It's a lot of food for one person, but hey, I'm not in Chicago very often. The waitress suggested the gorditas and I was set.  The Gorditas de Borrego came with three generous sized corn masa cakes stuffed with slow-cooked lamb ""chicarron prensado,"" (which is I guess the Mexican version of bacon) and topped off with avocado and salsa. The corn masa cakes were crispy, but also light and airy. A great start to the meal and each bite had me wanting more. I knew I had to pace myself if I wanted to eat later on, but they were too delicious and fresh to save and pack up. I ended up eating all three. My entree was the Enchiladas de Mole Poblano. The star of the dish was of course the delicious and complex mole sauce drenching the chicken enchiladas. The taste was indescribable, but I will try. Each bite left you with an initial burst of flavor, sweet, bitter, savory, and then it slowly faded to a pleasant spiciness. The mole had so many flavors and layers, but they all came together to make the dish work. The chicken was tender and the tortillas were also good, but they took a backseat to the mole. I've never tasted anything so deliciously complex before. I live in San Diego so I am surrounded by Mexican cuisine. If this was Mexican food, I am not sure what I've been eating for the past seven years.  Unfortunately, I didn't see the Master Chef while I was eating, but I later saw him when I walked over to Xoco to check it out. I couldn't miss an opportunity to meet him so when he went back to Frontera, I asked the hostess if I could meet him for a picture. I could see he was very busy trying to manage both restaurants, but he was still nice enough to meet me in the kitchen for a quick photo op. I highly recommend a detour to this restaurant if you are ever in Chicago. It will be worth the wait to try a piece of true México.",0.9964,0.816,0.154,0.03,0.47784979423868307

The food is fantastic - both at dinner and brunch.  At dinner, we split a bunch of small plates and all were seasonal, complex, and delicious.  Loved the sopes, tortilla soup, and anything with mole sauce.  Service was very helpful and friendly.  We sat at the bar for brunch and every so often Rick Bayless would pop out of the kitchen and survey the dining room just a few feet away from us.  I swear, I did my best Linda Blair imitation that morning, whipping my head around every time I heard the door to the kitchen swing open.  Yep, I am a crazy foodie/stalker.

2009-10-07,4.0,"Like everyone else, I'm a Top Chef fan, and the Top Chef Masters was notable for how much everyone LOVED Rick Bayless's food. And to add to that, I was just blown away by how nice a guy he seemed to be, especially for someone who is at the top of his game. Like, how cool is that? So on a recent trip to Chicago, I had to check it out for myself. A friend tried to get me reservations just before I left - nope, not even close. But apparently a fair amount of the restaurant is saved for walk-in's, so after a full day at work Wednesday, a Wed night redeye flight to Chicago, and then a full Thursday conference, I hauled my tired self through the rain and blowing wind to Frontera Grill and got there exactly at 6 pm. I was told it was already a 1 1/2 hour wait for a table for one! Luckily there was just one space left in the bar area. Phew! Decided to really go all out, because who knows if I'd ever have another chance to eat here? I tried the tostaditas (just-made tortilla chips with two different salsas), the enchiladas de chivo (goat enchiladas wrapped in homemade tortillas and served with a beer and tequila laced dark pasilla sauce), and the Thursday night special barbacoa de borrego (lamb marinated in red chile and slow-roasted in banana leaves). I really wanted to try some ceviche also, but decided to pass - as it was, this was already going to be way too much food. It was all good. The tortilla chips were fine, although nothing really stood out about them. The enchiladas de chivo were my hands-down favorite, that pasilla sauce was just delicious! And the lamb was also very good, although at that point I was getting so full! And the presentation did not disappoint either. The banana leaf package with chili-marinated lamb inside looked similar to the Rick Bayless dish I saw on Top Chef Masters. Of course, that was why I ordered it... As a final note, the servers were very nice and checked on me several times despite the growing crowd. By the time I was done with my dinner at 7 pm, it was really packed in the bar area. It was with a happy and full stomach that I headed back out into the cold, wind, and rain to walk back to my hotel.",0.9941,0.845,0.146,0.009,0.5121536796536795
2009-10-07,4.0,"It might be because I arrived close to closing, but I barely had to wait to be seated here, even though it was a Friday. I arrived with my girlfriend for a late dinner around 10pm. I was told that there would be a 30 minute wait, but 10 minutes later, I was informed that a table had opened up. The decor is nice and warm. The crowd density is what you'd expect from a restaurant by a famed chef who has been on television. It was very crowded, even at this late hour, and quite noisy. If you're looking to grab a bite and have some peace and quiet, you might want to hold out and get a table at Topolobampo, which is right through a curtained door, but has a more intimate dining experience. However, if you're like me and just wanted some good food, stay put. I ordered two small plates, Taquitos de Pollo and another dish that I forget the name of. My girlfriend had the Enchiladas de Mole Poblano and Tamal de Mole Amarillo. My two dishes arrived within a few minutes, but it was easily a half-hour before the other two items arrived. That changed our eating plans--we were originally just going to eat what we ordered, but ended up splitting the whole meal down the middle, since we were getting hungry waiting. The food, however, did not disappoint! Great, fresh tasting food came to the table, and was always presented with a smile, which must be difficult in a room full of tables set 2-3 feet apart. I would have given just about any other restaurant 3 stars for the wait, but understanding that this place is much talked about and therefore prone to crowding and delay, I'm giving Frontera the benefit of the doubt. All the dishes were flavorful, and needed no further seasoning. The mole on the enchiladas was a bit strong, but the black beans that accompanied it really helped offset the flavor.

I've only recently begun watching Top Chef, and frankly I couldn't care less about all the ""celebrity chefs."" If there is one thing that I care most about, it is simply the food. Since one of the my favorite foods is Mexican, I was immediately intrigued. It was time to bust out of my Taco Tuesday rut. We made a visit here for dinner on a recent trip to Chicago. Forget reservations, we arrived shortly after their 5pm opening and the place was already packed with people in their business suits and corporate attire. Half hour later, we're seated in the outdoor patio area, enjoying the ambiance of honking cars and ambulance sirens. Service was casual and pleasant, but we get right down to the food. All the starters looked good, so we ended up with the appetizer platter, a sampling of guacamole, empanadas, ceviche, and jicama salad. It was a good way to try a bit of everything. The much-talked about guacamole was a bit overpowering with the citrus flavors. The jicama salad was very crisp and refreshing with a hint of tartness. For the entrees, I had the Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena, while my wife had the Enchiladas de Mole Poblano. There's little doubt who is star of that enchilada dish. I couldn't help myself from reaching over to taste that mole. Bayless said that it took him over 20 years to perfect his mole recipe. I believe it. There is a complex mixture of flavors in the mole that's just tough to duplicate, and they all work in unison. As for my dish, what stands out the most is the bold flavors of the spicy red chile on the ribeye steak. Marinated, wood-grilled, ultra juicy and tender, it was the perfect compliment to the side of sweet plantains. That meat really packed a punch. With a side of soft handmade tortillas and a slathering of guacamole, I built my very own carne asada tacos. Very expensive, $29 carne asada tacos. With the recommendation of our waiter, we finished it all off with a slice of chocolate pecan pie, with a healthy dollop of Kahlua whipped cream and chocolate sauce on the side. The dessert was good, but not quite on the level of goodness from those entrees we had earlier. My margarita was so-so as well. I'd skip the drinks and appetizers, and head straight for the appetizers and entrees.

We just came out of Gino East for lunch and stuffed like we were never going to eat another meal, but we walked to Frontera Grill determined to make a reservation for the night (since they told us over the phone that they are no longer taking any reservations only sign-in so we actually have to physically be at the restaurant - insanity!!) You can seriously see the line out the door a mile away from Frontera Grill - we were thinking darn this place must really be good! We got there at 4pm,got in line for 20mins. sign our names and they told us to come back at 8:45pm but they still cant guarantee that a table will be open for us. WTF!!?? We decided to hit some bars and wait it out.  I think we got a little bit too tipsy so we ended up getting at Frontera grill a little bit past 9pm (and was nervous that we probably wont get a table at this point) we got to the place and they sat us right away! Jackpot! The place is really very artsy with lots of Mexican masks and local mexican arts. Then on to the Menu: Ordered some cocktails right away!  1)Blackberry Mojito: vanilla-infused D'Aristi rum, fresh mint, Klug Farm blackberries, lime juice. 10.00  2)Summer Margarita: 3 Generaciones blanco tequila, muddled organic cucumber, fresh lime juice, organic cane syrup. Shaken at the table. 10.00  3)Gold Margarita: Sauza Gold tequila, Cazadores blanco tequila and Gran Torres orange liqueur steeped with fresh lime juice. 7.00  4) Mexican Mojito: fresh-squeezed lime juice, muddled fresh mint, organic cane syrup, your choice of tequila or rum and a splash of soda. 9.50 All really good but not strong enough for me :)) Since we were all still stuffed from Ginos we decided to get 2 appetizers and just share two Entree: Appetizers: 1) Trio, Trio, Trio: a sampling of Ceviche Fronterizo, Ceviche Yucateco and Ceviche de Atun ""Chamoy."" 16.00  - 3 different kinds of ceviche in a martini type of glass - the seafood in each ceviche was amazing! one had shrimp, one had tuna, and one had calamari yum! it was addicting! 2) Tamal de Puerco en Mole Verde:  banana leaf-steamed tamal of fresh-ground corn masa and Maple Creek braised pork. Green pumpkinseed mole, arugula salad. 7.50  - I knew I had to order some type of Mole because that's what ulitmately what made him win Top Chef master and I swear to you, you have to order this dish! I think it had crack it was so good! lol! It was a small plate - only $7.50, I wish we ordered a few more plate of this because I can eat this on its own and Ill be a happy camper. The braised pork was so tender and juicy and the sauce was orgasmic! Entree: 1) Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena: Creekstone Natural Black Angus rib steak, marinated in spicy red chile and wood- grilled, served with black beans, sweet plantains with sour cream, and guacamole. 29.50  - this Carne Asada was featured in Food Network ""Best thing I ever ate"" so we had to order it and damn!

I grew up from San Diego so I know good Carne Asada, but damn this one was really good! 2) Poc Chuc de Puerco:  sour orange-marinated, grill-seared Maple Creek pork with Yucatecan garnishes: grill-roasted onions, sliced heirloom tomatoes, tangy Napa cabbage, avocado, habanero salsa, black bean ""soup."" 23.00  - I wanted to try another speciality so we tried their Porkchop marinated in Sour Orange. This was also recommended by the server.  It was really good too and just a tip - watch out for the little green sauce that comes with this dish - it was freakin' hot! I think it was made in Hell because it burned all of our tongue! The server warned us but silly me, i didnt believe him, i put a big spoonful of that melted fire and bam!! My mouth was on fire!!!!! it was good though lol! We had no room for desert so we decided to stop eating lol! We had the best time ever in Frontera Grill - I still dream about that Mole, im glad he doesnt have a restaurant in California otherwise I'd be 500lbs! You have to go to Frontera Grill at least once in your life - you will not regret it.  Rick Bayless is the man, if he can't do it, no one can!!!",0.9985,0.791,0.158,0.051,0.4933673469387757
2009-09-26,3.0,"I think there has been a lot of hype about this restaurant ever since Rick won Top Chef Masters. I don't know if all the extra traffic has necessarily been a good thing.  I had been trying to make reservations here for almost 2 months. They were actually booked out on a Saturday night through the rest of the year. Eventually, a friend of mine decided to start lining up at the door at 4:30. They reserve tables for walk-ins but the best chance of getting  is to line up about a hour before they begin seating. We were able to get a table for 8:00. They called us when the table was available. So basically, you wait in line for an hour to get on the list and then stick around the area for a few hours waiting for them to call.  We ended up with a table outside (we were a party of 7, so I'm sure that made it a bit more difficult). It was kind of a chilly and misty night. It wasn't ideal, but we made the best of it. I had the mojito with rum. It was really good. Not too sweet and very limey. The drinks run about $10 a pop. We had the guacamole and salsa. They were pretty standard. The salsas were not spicy at all so we decided to try the $2 all you can eat habanero salsa. OMG, that is some intense flames in your mouth! We all took big bites and then starting tearing up and begging for sour cream. No wonder it's $2 all you can eat. No one can eat more that a small dish of that stuff. You'd have to be rushed to the ER. Our server was great, though, he saw us all choking and brought us some sour cream faster that you can say enchilada.  The oysters were ok. Not the best. They come with two sauces, a Mexican mignonette and a mole type sauce. The mole was just weird on oysters. No thanks.  I had the duck tacos, my husband had the pork tacos and my friends had the lamb dish and the mole enchiladas. The tacos were just ok really. The meat had great flavor and the duck was cooked perfectly, but the sides that come with it were just ok. But they are pretty affordable. The tacos are only $16.50. Unfortunately, for us, the colder temps outside made our meals cool fast. Bummer. My friend who had the enchiladas had one bite and completely wrote off mole. The chicken tasted reheated and was lacking flavor. He ended up giving his left overs to our cab driver. My other friend thought his lamb was poorly seasoned. Okay, so to make a long story short, I was a little underwhelmed. The service was good, but not as attentive as it should be at a place like this, the food was just ok, not at all memorable. I know that this restaurant is and can be completely fantastic, but the heavy traffic always makes for a less that wonderful dining experience.",0.9986,0.753,0.206,0.041,0.5278659611992945
2009-09-26,2.0,"The first word that comes to mind is disappointing.  Could not wait to visit Rick's place. Are you kidding me? Top Chef Masters winner? Walked about 40 blocks while visiting Chicago to get to his place from the Metra station.  Was told 45-60 min wait, it actually took about 30 to sit 3 on the patio.  The first thing we noticed is that there are a number of areas in the restaurant that are in disrepair. My wife said the restroom had a broken door, and had phone numbers written on the walls. The curtains were stained, and there was high dust throughout the establishment.  The place sounded like a cafeteria, I know it was packed, but I dont think the experience was enhanced by me thinking a lunch room lady complete with hair net was plating up my food in the back. Try some sound dampening material on the walls Rick, take some of the money from the Hooters style merchandise counter at the front of the store. It was complete with T-shirts.........tacky  Its about attention to detail.  We ordered the Trio Trio Trio for an app.. Honestly, the shrimp cheviche was the only one that actually made us take notice. The tuna was flat, and the sunfish was VERY fishy.  Two drinks:  Mojito- WAY limey, had a nice muddle though.  Margarita: other that the fact that it was 10 bucks, they didnt leave the shaker, and I got a small martini glass that consisted of maybe 3 swallows, it was pretty good. Should have stayed away from the salt though, it overpowered the drink.  Entrees:  I had the Quesadillas Norteas with duck and pickled onions. The only way I knew I was eating Mexican cuisine is because there were re-fried black beans on my plate. I found the duck to be good but it had no zing. I suggest they use a different cheese in the quesadillas (they looked like soft tacos to me), the sharpness of the cheese was a hindrance to the dish. The beans were, by far, the best thing on my plate.  My wife had the Milanesa de Puerco: sold as a ""crusted pork loin"" what we got was a fried pork chop that was so thin it dried out to almost jerky on the edges from being fried. We expected to see a nice pork medallion that was crusted before roasting, served with a nice roasted tomato sauce/mole. What we got was a fried pork chop with alittle canned stewed tomatoes under it. Hugely under flavored. Again, the best thing on that plate was the black beans.  My son got the Tamal special of the day. The masa was VERY soggy because the plate was way over sauced. There was no flavor to the dish except the sauce. No depth in the overall flavor of the entree.  When we go to a place that is owned by a guy that is advertised the way that Rick is, we expect to be wowed. I wanna finish my plate and know that I cant do what that guy just did. Sadly, we didnt feel that way when leaving Frontera, what we did feel was raped. It was 104 with the tip for lunch for 3.  Either Rick needs to spend more time in his restaurant, or he needs an executive chef that will follow his profiles and stay in the box Rick created. As I stated before, its about attention to detail, and Frontera lacks it.  Once my wallet recovers, the experience will not be remembered. Too bad, I thought Tom Colicchio had a palate.",0.9834,0.851,0.098,0.051,0.5161688311688312

My friend and I were chatting excitedly about sampling Bayless' food, but sadly, we were disappointed. From drinks, to completion, the meal was rather disappointing. The only 'star' of our meal was an appetizer sampler platter and guacamole and chips. Both were excellent.  All the meals arrived at barely warm temperature.

We started out with Topolo Margaritas which were very good, really smooth, tasted perfect.  For appetizers we had guacamole (very good) and my bf had the Gazpacho Fronterizo.... WOW.  That was amazing.  I wish I had gotten a bowl for myself.  It was so tasty and crisp, and thank god the recipe is online because I could easily have that with dinner every night. Main course: I had the Mixiotes de la Hortaliza which was spicier than I thought it would be (I'm not really into anything that hot) but it was really good.  I actually had a few of my bf's tortillas with it, which helped soothe my hot mouth and were actually a good addition anyway.  I mean, I would have eaten the tortillas by themselves...so warm and fresh, mmm! My bf had the goat special whose name I can't remember (and it's not on the website, but it was the Tuesday night special), and he really liked that as well.  We were pretty stuffed after that so we didn't have dessert but the menu looked really good. My only complaint: we knew ahead of time that we would be waiting, which was fine. The problem is that there really wasn't anywhere TO wait. Your options are to stand in the foyer or hang out at the bar and hope someone leaves. But they serve food there so most people are in for the long haul, and there's not a lot of room to hover and wait for someone to get up; the waiters are trying to serve and the bathroom is on the other side. A better flow of traffic and a traditional bar (drinks only, tables to stand at) would help immensely.  Heck, just buy up the rest of the block and expand all three restaurants.",0.9952,0.782,0.19,0.028,0.6149636243386243

Had the braised brisket, and it was tough and tasteless. The tortilla chips, pitched on the menu as fresh fried, were cold and nothing special - certainly not worth paying for. Even the salsas, which used to just floor me, seemed toned way down in flavor.  Worst of all was the huckster routine by the waiter and the unpleasant atmosphere.

2009-09-21,3.0,"My husband and I visited Frontera with some friends on Saturday. We called in advance, and learned from the hostess that they only take reservations for approximately 10% of their restaurant.  Since they open at 5, she advised us to arrive at 4:30 and wait in line to be in the first seating.  We all had some spare time, so we headed down early to find a parking space and window shop around that area -- I'm glad we did.  When we arrived at 4 o'clock, the line was already 15 people long.  By 4:30, it was half way down the block, and at 5 PM it wrapped around the block to the next street. All of those people create an excitement, an anticipation for the food, and I guess that is where this restaurant went awry for me.  Was the food good?  Yes.  Was it even close to great? No.  Was it worth the hour wait?  I wouldn't do it again. We wanted to try a mixture of Rick Bayless' recipes, so we started with a few appetizers.  They were out of the Elote I had been hoping for (hadn't they just opened?!?), so we opted for a big bowl of guac (it was ok, nothing special) and the appetizer platter.  The appetizer platter had Quesadillas Capitalinas, Jicama Callejera, chicken taquitos and ceviche.  The presentation is lovely, and the food was wonderful.  We were excited for our meals to arrive, and I ordered a hibiscus daiquiri to pass the time.   I'm allergic to peppers (and eating at a Mexican restaurant, gasp!) but the waiter worked with me to find a dish I could eat, and he was very pleasant about it -- that lone earned them an extra star. We had the Poc Chuc de Puerco (orange marinated pork), 2 Tacos al Carbon (with steak, one spicy one mild), and the Enchiladas de Mole Poblano.  We ordered a side of the plantains, which were served with cheese and sour cream -- they were excellent!  However, not one dish was hot -- all of the food came out luke warm, and the mole was so cold it had to be sent back.  Overall, we were underwhelmed with the entrees -- there was nothing special, nothing awful, nothing we passed around to share, and no one really said ""Here, try this!"" like you do with an excellent meal.   The portion sizes were on the medium side, and we had enough room for desert, but nothing really caught our attention, so we ended up calling it a night. Both on our trip into the restaurant and on our exit, it was so crowded we could barely walk.  Along with the wait and the so-so food, that was the final straw that made us decide we'd rather eat at the Mexican dive down the street.",0.9837,0.86,0.103,0.036,0.48975636766334435
2009-09-20,3.0,"Full review in Blog Checking in our hostess stated ""Yes, we've been expecting you - and thank goodness you have reservations!""  Led quickly to our seats in the main dining room overlooking the open kitchen we were quickly seated, water was poured, and menus were delivered.   Browsing around the room we were greeted with much more whimsy - from obscure pinata and puppets to unique takes on Spanish art to the jovial latino music over the speakers, nothing remotely ""serious"" except the focus on food and fun. After a somewhat prolonged period our appetizer arrived - or rather ""appetizers.""  Strongly recommended by our server as a good way to experience Frontera as a first time visitor we decided to spend the $7.50pp charge for the ""Entremes Surtido"" an appetizer platter featuring 5 different items.  Presented attractively and emitting the most wonderful scents of lime, spice, and cilantro the dish was explained and we decided to taste things simultaneously beginning with the ""Taquitos de Pollo."" Pan fried to a crispy perfection the tortillas cracked easily to the bit giving way to a wonderfully creamy blend of moist chicken with accents of spice, sweet, sour, and smooth.    Our second and third tastes from the platter were ""Jicama Callejera,"" and ""Tostaditas de Ceviche."" While my sister didn't really appreciate the pineapple I personally thought the salad was excellent in flavor but could've used more textural variation.  The ceviche, on the other hand, was a winner in the opinions of us both with the heavily acidic flavor of the meaty marlin smoothed out by the bitter olives while the combination of chopped tomato, ham, jicama, and cilantro added a salsa-esque texture to the well done fish.   The final two components of the platter were a relatively boring (albeit tasty) guacamole with perfectly prepared tortilla chips and ""Quesadillas Capitalinas"" -  Mexico City-style corn masa turnovers stuffed with Samuels locally handcrafted Jack cheese and fresh epazote.  Biting into the puffs and met by a rush of gooey, smoky, and pungent cheese I was quite pleased and believe this was my favorite item on the platter.   With plates collected we began the 45 minute wait that would seperate us from our main courses. Sapitos - a trio of Xalapa-style gorditas (corn masa cakes) in chipotle-black bean sauce each with its own topping: scrambled eggs, grilled chicken, chorizo and plantains; homemade crema and queso fresco.  While certainly not as visually appealing as French cuisine, the myriad colors were definitely noteworthy with eye catching yellows contrasting with blacks, whites, and orange.  Tasting each of her gorditas, however, was somewhat disappointing with only the chorizo and plantains standing out and all three being luke-warm at best...as a matter of fact, the eggs were downright cold.  While I realize the place was busy, from a place receiving such acclaim this isn't really acceptable Hot Cakes Indgenas featuring two Iroquois white corn pancakes with whipped goat cheese, piloncillo-agave syrup, grilled bacon and two eggs sunny-side up.  Arriving with hot eggs, cool bacon, and luke-warm pancakes this dish once again showed a step of mistiming from the kitchen but thankfully didn't suffer as much as my sister's dish.  Tasting like thin and 'almost' crispy cornbread I loved the taste and texture of the pancakes and found them further complimented by the complex and airy whipped goat cheese that tasted like a creamy sweet butter with almond tones.  Topping the pancakes with an ample helping of the minimally bitter yet entirely smooth agave syrup was another bonus.  As the eggs were organic farm eggs and served piping hot I perforated the yolk of one and allowed it to soak into the pancake while I ate the other sans-addition.  The final part of the dish, the locally sourced thick-cut hickory bacon was excellent and not at all overcooked - but as mentioned it was cold. While I realize Frontera has been a big deal for years there is no doubt they've benefited recently from Chef Bayless' win on TCM - or perhaps they've become a little overwhelmed and this may explain the inconsistency from the kitchen in terms of temperature and timing?  While I cannot be sure, I've no doubt the restaurant will continue to do well and I have much respect for the Chef's attention to organics and the slowfood movement.  In the end some dishes were excellent while others were somewhat average - in general I guess I'm just not a fan of Mexican or Latin cuisine.  All told I enjoyed Frontera but do not think I'd rush back - and I certainly wouldn't wait more than thirty minutes for a table.",0.9984,0.794,0.162,0.044,0.5630196523053664

2009-09-13,5.0,"Went to Frontera on Saturday for a surprise birthday dinner and the birthday girl wasn't the only person pleasantly surprised.  We did our research and showed up early to stake out a spot in line.  One of our group arrived at 3:45 pm and there was already one person in front of him- the doors open at 5!  Thankfully he was joined shortly thereafter by his wife who brought a personal radio so he could listen to the ND football game.  When I arrived at 430 there was a line down the block. The host (I think? Perhaps manager?) came out and took everyone's party size and name down.  A few of us hadn't yet arrived and we were surprised to hear that they could hold our table for up to an hour while we waited for our friends.  This turned out to be unnecessary and we were seated on the patio within ten minutes of the doors opening.  It was a bit cramped for eight people, but the beautiful weather made for a great al fresco meal. The Topolo Margarita I had was great, not too sweet like those made from a mix and very light tasting though it packed a huge punch.  We all shared three appetizers- chips and guac, duck flautas, and the Trio Trio Trio ceviche which had a sweet ahi tuna ceviche, one with spicy Hawaiian blue marlin, and a third with shrimp, calamari, and citrus.  The ceviche trio was amazing!  It all tasted so fresh and disappeared very quickly.  I shied away from the larger entrees and had the tacos al carbon with skirt steak.  Everything on the plate was delicious and in good proportion to each other.  The rest of my group got various entrees and our waiter kept the fresh tortillas coming since everyone ate them alongside their meal, no matter what they had. The most amazing thing, other than the outstanding food, was the number of people who waltzed into the door between 6 and 7:30 expecting a table.  The wait by then was 4 hours!  They all seemed outraged that they couldn't just show up and eat at a restaurant owned by the recent Top Chef Masters winner.  Really, guys?  They don't take reservations.  Show up early or be prepared to have a long conversation at the bar over a lot of great margaritas.",0.9966,0.761,0.192,0.047,0.5586375661375661

My entree was that Mexican Dish that Few Can Do Right, yes, the enchiladas with the mole poblano.  This was equally good, even if poblano is the most widely-attempted mole in America.  The chicken, as I would expect at this price point, was cooked flawlessly; moist and tender with nary a hint of gristle or bone.   As for the mole, this point in life I'm happy if it doesn't taste canned, and so it more than passed the test.

Very excited as we had a Rick Bayless sighting - he was working with his staff at his new place XOCO (check out menu online - can't wait to try it!).  After a pleasant wait enjoying the fab weather and chatting with other Bayless fans, we were invited in promptly at 5:00, given a pager and scored 2 seats at the bar. Wasn't sure how long the wit would be, so we ordered the pork empanadas to go along with our beers. We were happily surprised when our pager when off after 15 mins and we were shown to a lovely table for 2.   We were very impressed with the service throughout - our waiter (tall fellow) was exremely pleasant and helpful with descriptions of the menu (which just changed) and paced the meal very well. The busboy was also very efficient and friendly. We never felt rushed even though the place was pretty full and lots of people were waiting in the bar area.  For the most part, the food was awesome. Do not go here expecting typical Mexican restaurant portions - this is all about quality not quantity. The food is sophisticated and high quality.  We started with the pork empanadas which featured a smoky pork filling and crispy exterior that contrasted nicely with the avocado sauce and tangy watercress salad.  We also had the ceviche trio. Loved the presentation in little martini style glasses. While they were all good, the Ceviche de Atun ""Chamoy"":  sashimi-quality Hawaiian ahi tuna tossed with crunchy jicama and tangy, fruity, spicy red chile-apricot chamoy salsa.  was a standout. We'll definitely get a larger portion of this on a return visit. For entrees, I had the seafood of the day - a grilled swordfish with veracruz sauce. The fish was moist, flavorful, with a nice grilled taste. It was accompanied by disappointing mash (very watery not creamy) and pickled green beans and carrots that were al dente but spicy. Hubby had the special - very tender shredded suckling pig served with tasty black beans and fresh tortillas on the side. Beware the hot sauce served with this dish - it was super hot - but we were warned! We were determined to try dessert - even tho we wer pretty full. Wish we had followed the waiter's advice and ordered the choc/raspberry tart but went for the caramel custards which were a bit weak. I have had better flan in run of the mill Mexican joints. Coffee was very good though so I was not unduly disappointed.  Overall an excellent experience that we will repeat. If you go, plan ahead and go early to avoid the frustration of long lines.

My girlfriend arrived a bit before me - at least early enough to get started on the Summertime Margarita :) - and put our name in.  About 80-90 minutes later we were sitting outside on a chilly September night. Our waiter could not have been friendlier, well-versed and honest about the menu.  We started with 6 oysters - 2 each of the varied selection offered - and pork empanadas.  Two of the three oysters served as some of the best I've had, and the accompanying sauce of orange, lime, onion, cilantro and more was one of the best sauces I've ever had - on oysters or otherwise. As an entree, I went with the Falda Asada Brava - farm-fresh flank steak and hand-made salsa that matches and beats the same from tacos in Mexico - while my girlfriend had the Puerco.  Both served with fluffy, warm corn tortillas we traded bites and compliments for aspects of each others meals.  I complimented the fresh (from the roof) tomatoes and tender pork while she (rightly) complimented the tamales and even the smokey salsa. For dessert, we sided with a simple Mexican hot chocolate, a welcome reprieve from the standard after-dinner coffee and perfect for a chilly night on the patio on Clark.

Kept me cool! I had to take home half the ribs-happily to enjoy the next day! Oi vey!

Anyway, what about the food?  Well, I won't say it blew me away but it was pretty damn good.  Here's what we got: Drink 1: Blackberry Mojito ($10.00) - Refreshing and sweet.  Great summer drink.  Not very boozy but still quite delicious. Drink 2: Mezcal Margartia ($10.00) - Despite having a pinkish color, the drink itself had a rather smoky flavor.  Definitely not like a regular margarita but in a good way. Appetizer: ""Entrems Surtido"" ($7.50 per person) - Basically a sampler appetizer platter that included quesadillas, taquitos ceviche, jicama salad and guacamole.  Warning: this dish is HUGE.  As good as everything was on the plate, I almost wouldn't recommend it because you'll be so full after eating it that you won't have any room left for your entrees. Entrée 1: ""Tacos al Carbon"" ($15.00) - You can pick from a list of meats; my fiancée went with duck, which she thought was quite tasty.  The dish comes with guacamole, beans, salsa and tortillas and the portions are pretty hefty, especially after chowing down on the ""Entrems Surtido"". Entrée 2:  ""Pozole Rojo"" ($11.50) - A pork and hominy stew with a poached egg on top.  The pork was very tender and the soup was bursting with flavor.  I think I would've enjoyed this dish even more if it was 30 degrees out but it was still quite good despite it being a hot summer day.  The stew comes with lettuce, radishes and tortilla chips on the side, which I think you're supposed to toss into the stew to give it some crunch (that's what I did at least). All in all, it was a very good meal.  The food wasn't remarkable in that I feel like I've had comparable dishes at other places in Chicago (Mixteco, Fonda del Mar) but it was still very tasty and everything was prepared well.  The prices are a little high for what you're getting but still pretty reasonable.  My advice is to not buy into the hype that's been generated by Bayless's success on Top Chef Masters and just go in with no expectations except to have a good meal.  I think as long as you're not excepting to be blown away, you'll enjoy Frontera Grill.",0.9973,0.801,0.154,0.045,0.546751820975959

I had the Tacos al Carbon and you know, I was told to compare this place to the food I've had in Mexico and sure enough, I'd say this is the closest I've had to authentic Mexican cuisine without being in Mexico.  However, in Mexico, I pay $2 for a plate of tacos.  Here, it's $15. My wife had the huevos and it was good, but slightly unseasoned and bland. No one else jumped up and did cartwheels.  The meal was really good, but I'm not certain it scores at the top of my list.  It definitely beats Mesa Grill hands down, but then again, I think Taco Bell beats Mesa Grill, so that's not saying much.

The ceviche trio was pretty good, but the drinks and the rest of the food were just OK.  I just don't like the flavors that much--they were too sweet, needed more acid, or in the case of my drink, too peppery.

Having said that, maybe Mr. Bayless should spend a little more time in his restaurants and less time in Merida, Oaxaca, Mexico City ect. We Planned a trip to Chicago from the suburbs around the night at Frontera grill. We were very dissapointed in the level of service and the quality of the food. It hurts me to write this because I wanted so bad to love it. I wanted to see some things that I had not before, I wanted to have some eye opening experience.

2009-08-05,5.0,"Rick Bayless, I would do VERY bad things to you if you would cook for me every day. Due to the incredibly high popularity of Frontera Grill since Bayless' triumphant showing on Top Chef Masters, the place is crazy busy all the time.  Since Frontera takes limited reservations, your best bet is to show up before dinner service starts, get your bootie and line and pray for the best.  I arrived with two friends in tow at 5:10 and the line was already around the block.  However, once the doors opened at 5:20, the line started moving and we were seated outside with no wait.   Now since I was dining outside, I didn't really get to check out too much of the décor inside.  I'm sure it's lovely.  But bottom line: When the food is this good, who gives a shit about what the place looks like??  The smatterings of outdoor tables right on Clark Street provide excellent people watching.  And you're set back a bit from the sidewalk so you don't feel like the passerbys are interrupting your meal.  It's truly the perfect outdoor dining experience. The menu changes quite frequently at Frontera, so you will want to check the website for the most up to date offerings.  Of course you have to order the guacamole (They put sun dried tomatoes in it!  Not to be missed!), but the real appetizer star was the Queso Fundido de Hongos, which is Otter Creek Farm organic cheddar melted with beer-braised mushrooms, bacon, habanero salsa, cilantro.  Duuuuude.... Think of that queso dip from Chili's.  Now imagine it with really, really good ingredients and served with homemade tortillas.  You just drooled a little, right?  It was so delicious it should be illegal. My entrée was the Enchiladas de Mole Poblano.  I admit it's not the most adventurous menu choice, but the enchiladas are knock-you-on-your-ass amazing.  Whatever Bayless puts in that mole sauce is magic and the Gunthorp free-range chicken filling is ahhh-mazing.  Add a side of black beans and you've got a winner.  My friend ordered the Puerco en Salsa de Elote Verde, which is grilled Maple Creek pork loin in a sauce of roasted tomatillos, fresh corn, chile guero, hoja santa. Rustic mashed potatoes, grilled Spence Farm summer squash.  Um, yeah.  Pretty much the tastiest, most tender pork I've ever eaten.  I'm glad we both like to share entrees. The one bummer?  I was less than thrilled with the service.  I think our waiter came to take our order and drop off our check... good thing we're low maintenance.  But again, when the food is this good, the service doesn't really matter, however I do think that if you're going to a restaurant that is so ""famous"" right now, the service should be top notch.  And sadly, it wasn't. Still, without a doubt, a five star meal.  Oh Rick?  If you ever leave your wife, you know where to find me!",0.9957,0.759,0.172,0.069,0.5592265795206971

Every Saturday I notice a huge line outside Rick Bayless' eponymous Chicago restaurant.  So I finally checked it out with the gf. We had a great time. You have to get lucky. Most of the patrons are walk-ins. We scored a table just as we walked in. The seating gods were kind to us. The service is no-frills which perfectly suits the casual vibe. The prices are very reasonable considering the brand name locale and chef. I recommend ordering 2 dishes at a time. The portions are small and so the food gets cold very quickly. Just chill and have some beer at a leisurely pace. The menu changes to reflect the seasons. We ordered: Flautas de Puerco- Maple Creek Farms pork, pea tendrils, and cascabel-tomatillo sauce. Yummy! Enchiladas Gratinadas- homemade tortillas with chipotle braised beef. So good, but you have to eat it quickly while it stays hot. Tamal Churriqueso- a corn masa tamal with hoemmade chorizo, avocado, queso cheese. This was a soft and creamy tamal. The flavors were sweet and delicate which was nice bc the other dishes are bolder. Queso Fundido de Milanesa- All I can say is that I like fried breaded crispy pork in cheese! It comes in cute iron skillet with fresh tortillas and two kinds of hot sauces (red and green). Very rich, but dee-lish. Grass-Fed Organic Grilled Ribeye Steak- This was sooo good! The grill really imparted a nice smoked flavor that complimented the spices in the sauce. It came with plantains and black beans. Beers are $4-$5. Cheap for River North. I am definitely coming back.",0.9955,0.791,0.204,0.005,0.6346296296296298
2009-06-24,4.0,There is a reason that this place has won the James Beard Foundation Award.  The food and service is superb.  We ate outdoors on a beautiful June day and found it much to our liking.  The food is well prepared and you leave wanting to go back again.  It is owned by famed chef Rick Bayless who is the brother of Skip Bayless of ESPN and sports journalism fame.  Great food and great atmosphere.  Not only was the food good but so was the people watching. I will make sure to go back again the next time I visit Chicago.,0.9652,0.751,0.239,0.01,0.5626262626262627
2009-06-18,4.0,"Absolutely adore this spot - so perfect for brunch after a night out.  My experiences have been varied on service, but not on food - it is great. It is nuevo-Mexican, and done very well. Excellent presentation, style and flavor. Even the variation on service is between very good and great, so I'm not complaining. One of the things I like the range of spice levels offered, multiple salsa options from mild to spicy, but all flavorful, and dishes prepared with spiciness matching the ingredients. It is rare, and appreciated. I just wish they had more tables - make a reservation! It can be tough to get in, but totally worth it.

It seems like such a fun restaurant, the decor is really bright, the kitchen's right there and you can look in (to some extent) on the hustle and bustle going on there. The service was attentive, with the waiter swooping in to refill my diet coke whenever it looked even remotely low. The guacamole was really good, the avocado was nice and fresh and there was just a hint of chili powder in it for some spice. The tortilla chips were also really good, they clearly had been freshly made and were nice and salty. We also got one of the ceviches, which was nice, although I didn't really have enough of it to pass judgement. I had the Tacos al Carbon with steak and that was great. Nicely seasoned steak, spicy sauteed onions and peppers and a dollop of that guacamole served with fresh tortillas...Mmmmmm. It also came with a dish of pinto beans served with pork, which brought back fond memories of my favorite taqueria in Sacramento's beans (oh taqueria Jalisco, how I miss you...). I tried my cousin's duck tacos al carbon, and they were delicious too. Her sister seemed to be enjoying the catfish tacos she got, too.

2009-06-09,2.0,"Went to Frontera last week and I will break it down  Positives: Server was great very attentive quick to get our drink orders, Drinks were expensive but worth the $10 price tag  We had a table of 6 people we ordered 3 entrees and 8 small plates/appetizers , we made it a point to attempt to try all styles food, entrees we had the Atlantic salmon which was OK but small and I have had better many other places, the chili rellanos - the server saved some of this ""special dish"" for us I wish he would not have the breading on the outside was bland and flavorless, and the 3rd entree was the enchiladas not very adventurous and mediocre at best.  For the small plates we tried everything ceviche's, queso fundido's, duck carnitas, every salsa they had and a few other things which I forgot meaning they were not very memorable.  I consider myself a foodie who enjoys a good value and while I did not think the food was necessarily overpriced I did think it was over hyped nothing stood out about this place and for the price it was not worth it. It is packed with tourists and people who drive in from the burbs  Save yourself the hassle and take the time to research some Mexican restaurants around Chicago that are not downtown there are many better options for much better prices.",0.9953,0.769,0.22,0.011,0.4636082555437394
2009-06-09,5.0,"Frontera Grill is an outstanding restaurant because both food and drink strike the balance of flavor and creativity.  Big, bold, authentic Mexican flavors are given special treatment and enjoy superb execution. Let's start off at the bar.  These are the best margaritas I've ever had.  They're done martini style, premium tequila and liquor shaken perfectly with freshest sweet and sour.   The food is excellent.  You can taste the supreme quality of ingredients used in all the dishes: fresh fish, delicious free range beef, juicy duck breast.  Good enough on their own, at Frontera the food is accompanied by decadent sauces.  Rich cream, fresh avacodo, cilantro, tomatillo, roasted tomatoe and chillis all delight the palette with the flavors of Mexico. If I had to fault Fronera Grill for anything, I'd say the service is not as good as the food.  Expect long waits any night of the week, and on occaision the hosts seem a bit aloof.  Servers are attentive, but not always that friendly. Frontera is a little bit expensive, you pay a premium for the celebrity status of Chef Bayless, but not worse than most downtown restaurants and the culinary delights in my opinion are certainly worth it.",0.988,0.727,0.225,0.048,0.5794546850998464

We had to wait quite a while for our server to show up and for our guac, but after that he was pretty on the ball.  The food was so/so. I ordered some egg/steak thing in a corn tortilla smothered with cheese. It was mushy and didn't have much flavor (although the beans on the side rocked!). I can't remember what my boyfriend ordered, but it's his ""hangover meal"" in his hometown in Mexico, and he was not pleased.

I've always enjoyed the drinks prepared by the bartenders and have to admit that my favorite apps are still the sopes rancheros. Out of this world yummy. Entree wise you can't seem to go wrong. Pick any entree and chances are you'll love it. The desserts are crazy good and if you don't get one it'll be a great loss.  Decor is pretty fun and colorful and the staff is very nice except the hostess. Not sure what the issue is there? I took a star away for that alone.

2009-05-05,4.0,"So Rick Bayless is still churning his brand of Mexican flair like nobodies business at his Topolobampbo / Frontera combo space restaurant I see... When trying to hit up another newer eatery for lunch last week only to find it closed for a photoshoot, I quickly turned here to an old standby... like my favorite old pair of brokedown, assed out, Levi's 501 blues... it's just an easy, comfortable fit.  The atmosphere on the casual Frontera side (Topolo is the more upscale of the two) is total hustle and bustle - a bit on the loud side with a hopping a mix of tourists hoping to catch a glimpse of ""The Ricker"" and local city business folk that love a good, flair-filled Mexican meal and know where to find it. Décor-wise we're talking Spanish tile floors, mache masks, semi-cramped dining quarters of wood tables and chairs, all surrounded by incredibly colorful works of floral, abstract and totally cuckoo Spanish art. Bring your loudest hammer pants... you'll fit in fine!  The service is warm and slow... almost like being in Mexico itself... sit back, enjoy and start with the house guacamole and a salsa duo. You designate the level of hotness you're yearning for and go from there. The guac is piled high, nice and chunky with a fresh air of citrus bursting throughout, you gotta love this stuff! Monthly specials are always on tap and ever changing, but a definite constant I've fallen deeply head-over-heels for are the Enchiladas de Puerco: homemade tortillas rolled around savory pulled pork, caramelized onions and bacon with a tomatillo-poblano sauce... Yum in my Tum! As one of the 'small plates' dishes this bundle of love is ideal for a shared starter among friends. Also to be devoured are entrées like mix and match tacos al carbon or my favorite, the Pescado en Salsa de Elote: wood-grilled, serrano-marinated fresh day-boat catch (last week's was swordfish) served with creamy fresh corn sauce infused with chilaca chiles. Ay Chihuahua!! Seriously delicious... the perfect mix of delicate and savory with bold and spicy flavors swimming around in a creamy, sweet dream of a sauce. It's utterly lovely.  Desserts have consistently eluded me as I'm always deliriously full by the time the sweets menu rolls around, granted, they say Bayless doesn't disappoint with his Oaxaca chocolate and crema cake. Considering everything else is pretty spot on, I'll believe them... wait, who are 'they' anyway? These 'they' would be far cooler if they actually shared a bit of that cake with me next time.

Aren't margaritas supposed to be substantial?  The hubby's was good, but the size of a small martini, for $10.  My mojito was delish and i nursed it while we waited...and waited...and waited an hour and a half for a table. But, the wait was worth it.  We tried the ceviche trio - ahi tuna, shrimp and calamari and Hawaiian sunfish in their marinades which came with chips - it whetted the appetite and we were ready for dinner. Hubby had the enchiladas de puerco, which were rolled in flavorful soft tortillas, a spicy tomatillo sauce and rice.  He also ordered the pinto beans, earthy, tasty and just the right consistency, which he mixed with his rice.  A great way to combine!  He was smacking his lips throughout the meal.... Mine was the flank steak, which came with a spicy tomato sauce, sweet tamales covered in just the right amount of sour cream and fresh cheese - it was like dessert, but not enough to prevent me from wanting a sweet meal-ender.  When I ordered it, the server asked (not as a question, however), ""medium rare?"", to which I replied, ""you bet!"".   The grass fed beef was tender, tasty and the fresh cilantro on the plate gave it a blend that made my taste buds dance.  There was also a salsa included, but it was a bit spicier than I liked, so I left it alone to the folks who like to light their mouths on fire. Dessert was the chocolate pecan pie, served with Khalua flavored creme freche.  The pie was so chocolaty and didn't have the teeth-wincing sweetness pecan pies usually have.  Chocolate cappucino and espresso topped of the meal and we left happy and talking about this meal on the way home and again in the morning. We'll be back - but the next time, I'm trying the shrimp and we'll make reservations ahead of time! I believe in great customer service, so I'm taking off one star due to the hostess's lack of happy and her mumbling so low that we had to ask several times what she said...and we're not so old as to be deaf.",0.9953,0.838,0.134,0.028,0.44073412698412695

2009-04-03,1.0,"I was saving my first review for a really great dining experience, but i had to write about Frontera instead. I had no expectations of this place or Bayless coming in, so my experience is fairly unbiased and raw. You'll see a lot of Bayless fans here who've waited to try his place, and perhaps that factors in to a good rating, but please do read some of the bad reviews and decide on your own, with a tempered view of what this place is hyped up to be. We got there at 9, and put our names down. I saw a couple waiting outside like us and had assumed they were also waiting for a table. 15 min passed by in the cold and rain, only to find that they were waiting for the valet to bring their car. I thought... ""uh oh, it's not a good sign when the valet service takes 15 minutes. This was a Thursday night, and we finally got seated at 9:45. Ok, so that's annoying but that's acceptable. But i will add that there isn't a particular reason why they can't do their reservations better, and there isn't a good reason for a 45 min wait when it's that late for dinner on a Thur night. We get seated near the entrance, and i notice that there are 4 women around the reception desk; two handling the seating and two just literally standing there. We have no water, and we're missing one table setting, but they didn't seem too concerned. Finally someone comes by and gives us water, and we have to remind him twice to get us an extra table setting. Our waitress takes the drink order, and doesn't bother to tell us about their daily special dishes or anything that's good whatsoever; fine, maybe that's just how it is here. We order some appetizers. She brings out my beer, and puts it in front of the wrong person (i was the only one that ordered a drink, so how hard is it to remember this?). I slowly move the glass and beer toward me (so she'd notice), but she didn't and it didn't seem to matter one bit that she served the wrong person. She later comes around again to take our main order and when two of us indicated to her we wanted the daily special (lamb) she told us they were all out of it. She apologized for this, but it's fairly mindless not to point this out and having the two of us to go through the menu again to order our entree. So at this point we're starving - at least the appetizers came out in acceptable time. I ordered their pork loins and this other friend who wanted the special ordered enchiladas. We haven't eaten since lunch and we were starved, and pretty much anything at this point would have been good to eat, but the dishes were hard to finish. My pork was, as my friends described it ""funky"", dry, and certainly not particularly Mexican. It was bland with some weird sauce, and i was not pleased. My friend only ate half of his dish. At some point, my friend spilled a whole glass of water, which spilled on to the floor near the entrance. This was done right in front of the two Mexican ladies i mentioned earlier. minutes passed... nothing done, and now my feet are in the water a bit as well. I kept looking at them like ""Are you guys gonna ask someone to clean this up?"" and finally after a good 10 minutes, someone wiped it off the floor. I mean, it didn't bother me too much, but what if someone took a spill there? It's just total disregard for safety and just the basic desire to keep the place to some standard. And it's now nearly 11 PM, and things are not that busy. By the end of the night, it had taken us 2 hours to finish out dinner, and we weren't being too social or chatty. I don't think they even thanked us or said goodbye when we left. As with many people, i expect to have great food and service, or at least for one to make up for the shortcomings of the other. Frontera doesn't have either of these... the food isn't anything that blows the mind or the palette; It didn't occur to me that I was even having Mexican. Service, decor and environment (noisy enough to make you talk louder) can definitely use an overhaul, and the staff there should be all replaced with some real pros. I hear Bayless tries to keep it as authentic as possible and keeps the staff that way as well (lazy and inattentive, i guess is ""authentic"") but i am not paying $30 for an entree in Mexico, so either make the service better or bring down the price to match  - I've gotten better food and service at a $15 place.",0.9979,0.802,0.142,0.056,0.5276009869759869

It was so sweet, and so crunchy and fresh and very refreshing! The chile was not spicy at all and it brought some flavor to the jicama. The presentation was so beautiful, this was a great starter!  Now for my main dish....Puerco en Mole Verde Queretano (garlic-marinated Maple Creek pork loin, slow-cooked over the coals, with Queretaro-style green mole of poblano chiles, plantains, sesame seeds, peanuts and sweet spices. Savory corn masa tamales, nopal-poblano rajas) ... UN-BELIEVEABLE.  I was a little hesitant as first because the word chiles scares me away because I'm not a fan of spicy foods. but nothing about this dish was spicy at all. The pork lion was very tender, and the mole verde sauce complemented the pork lion. The corn tamales were delicious, they were the best tamales I've ever eaten. The sauce was DELICIOUS. It wasn't heavy at all, and the portion size was fantastic. I left feeling full and it wasn't a food coma full. But full and very very happy.  The thing i REALLY loved about Frontera Grill was that the menu was not your typical mexican menu with 75% of the menu filled with quesadillas, tacos, taquitos..chicken, beef, or vegetarian......

I really find his enthusiasm for Mexican cuisine inspiring and I knew no matter what I ordered, I'd like it. I was with a group of seven and we enjoyed a spread of appetizers: guacamole, ceviche, quesadillas, and chicken taquitos. There were two salsas. I only tried the red, which had a deep, smokey flavor. The chips were very light and worked as the perfect vehicle for the dips. I made the mistake of ordering something rather boring: pork tacos. Now, these were no ordinary tacos, but if you're going to a Bayless restaurant, you should really think about spreading your wings a bit. I'm disappointed in myself for not thinking about this ahead of time. Because seriously, Chicago has tons of authentic Mexican joints where you can get a great taco. However, I will say I'm glad I got to try the house made tortillas...WOW.  There is a real thoughtfulness that goes into this menu. The Gold Margarita was perfect and I heard lots of compliments on two of their fancier versions. I somehow managed to squeeze in dessert, the pistachio ice cream topped with hot fudge. Damn...that's one combination of flavors. I'm really happy I finally got to see what this place was all about and it did not disappoint.",0.9858,0.778,0.172,0.05,0.6530666666666667

However, I had a coffee made with tequila, Kahlua and chocolate and it was the perfect ending to the meal.

In addition, even though we asked for no onions (she can not digest those either) they arrived with them right on top!) We resorted to ordering rice and beans, just so she could eat something!

2009-03-02,1.0,"""Just the facts, Ma'am."" OK, without too much emotional judgment, here are the facts from our dinner at Frontera Grill on Feb 2602009: Our party of three was seated in the worst location the restaurant offers, and we had a reservation. Seated and very cramped, we found a dish the size of a tablespoon filled with herbed nuts. Literally not even enough for one handful. This was supposed to be shared by the entire group (we were three). I kept thinking to myself, doesn't EVERY mexican place offer at the very least a basket of chips and salsa? NOPE. Nope and NOPE. Our order was taken by someone that seemed more disinterested by his duties than we were with the paltry dish of nuts. It only gets worse.  Our experience is somewhat improved by a few drinks. Cold Negro Modelo and Pacifico are a pleasure whatever the circumstances. This, however, was fleeting. Our food arrived. Since when do you call Fajitas, Tacos? Two of us ordered the steak tacos. When it arrived, here is what was presented: One bowl of bean soup, a small cask of tortillas and the woeful, fatty, mini pile of finely sliced steak (or was that horse meat, not sure) and peppers (peppers?). That's it. How did tacos become bean soup, meat shreds and peppers? Is this authentic Mexican? Is Rick Bayless insane? Is he kidding me?!! Worst sit-down dinner I have had in Chicago in a long time. I couldn't even eat the tacos because I kept having to spit out the fatty meat shreds. Sorry to gross you out here. It's making me nauseous just thinking about it again. Wow, what a let down. These are the facts. You can make your own judgements. I made mine: never go back to Frontera Grill. The best Mexican food is not someone else's version of ""authentic"" or ""gourmet"". The best Mexican food is the kind you make yourself at home, the way you like it. Mexican food should never be expensive. It's not meant to be. It's supposed to be simple, it's Mexican. (Beans, meat, veggies, tortillas) Simple. Rick, I'm sorry, but you disappointed me completely. I won't be back alone or with anyone else. I'll take Trader Joe's taquitos, manchego cheese and avocado made at home any day over the disappointment I got at Frontera Grill. Adios.",-0.7458,0.865,0.061,0.074,0.5008057280883368

This is a horrible set up, I do not know why busy places even try to still use this cause it basically forces you to stalk other people for there table.

So we get our food and the tortilla soup was very good, but it took them forever to clear the table after we were done eating and then forever for them to bring the second course.

Now I know why:  We started out with Trio Trio Trio, three ceviches; one with tiny cubes of sunfish, one shrimp and avocado, and one tiny cubes of tuna.  Each tiny taste was an explosion of super fresh sashimi-quality fish, with the taste of lime, chiles, blood orange, and other supernatural ingredients.  This, along with a deceptively smooth margarita, and suddenly, you realize that it's not cold anymore, it's warm, and you're surrounded by the rich reds, yellows, and oranges of Mexico - indeed, you are surrounded by Mexican art that makes you wonder what else might be in those margaritas.

2009-01-13,5.0,"We are so totally super happy with our visit to Frontera Grill Saturday night.  Here is our story and how we met Chef Rick Bayless;  Chicago was cold, windy and snowing Saturday night, and after having already done the must do and trying some authentic world class deep dish pizza-pie the night before, (at Edwardo's, see my review of there), we wanted something different.    And being a (Texan) fan of Mexican food and Bobby Flay, I did a quick google for the terms ""Iron Chef Chicago"".   If you search that you will see an article in the Chicagoian about their local Chef Rick Bayless battling it out with Flay on last seasons opener, Battle Buffalo.   I had just watched that episode like last Tuesday and I liked Rick's style, and we were surprised to discover that Frontera was just on the next block from our hotel, like a 3 minute walk!    Awesome!     And as you will see by our photo with him, Rick Bayless is there every day.   Unlike other ""celebrity chefs"" such as Bobby Flay, Mario Batali, Emeril, etc., where you can never meet them at their locations, yes, Rick Bayless is THERE.   Our waiter said, -every- day.   Anyway, let's get to the experience.   After finding this on the Internet and reading a few Yelp reviews we were totally sure this was where we wanted to have dinner.  So I called to make reservations only to learn that at 6PM Saturday night they were no longer taking reservations.  Was told that there is a bar area with open seating first come first served, and that the wait for a dinner table was one hour to one and a half hours.   No problem, we just put on our coats and gloves and stomped through the snow a few minutes and showed up in person to reserve a table and they happily accepted my reservation.    Being hungry and a little aggressive we then stood in the bar side waiting for anyone to leave a table and by probably what was sheer luck, a couple stood up and left like in less than a few minutes.   So we nailed that table fast and started out with a few drinks.   (Check the photo section for our uploads as we photographed the whole menu including the mixed drink section....)  Now let's get to the FOOD!   Woo Hoo!  We started with Margaritas - My wife selected the Vanilla Margarita with Cazadores Blanco Taquila infused with Mexican vanilla and Hoja Santa leaves, 10-year-old Torres Brandy, agave syrup and fresh squeezed limonada.  Being a pepper lover, I selected the Margarita Yucateca with Milagro Blanco 100% Agave Tequila, fresh squeezed lime and orange, organic cane juice infused with roasted Habanero.  See, that's what I am talking about!   Our drinks were mixed and shaken right there at the table and they were extravagantly delicious.   This was the start of a world class food adventure!   We then ordered the Ceviche Yucateco steamed organic shrimp and calimari tossed with lime, orange, habanero, avocado, jimcaya and cilantro with Tortilla chips, as well as Ensalada Frontera a mixture of young seasonal greens with wood-grilled onions, radishes, fresh home-made cheese (!!!!!!), and roasted garlic dressing.    Yet before our first food arrived, my wireless tag with led lights went off indicating that our table was open.   So we cleared our bar side tab, told them where to deliver the food (table 42) and we were seated at a fantastic table where I could see right into the open kitchen.   Pure heaven as I love stuff like this!    As soon as we were seated, Jonathan assisted us the rest of the night, and he had our starters ready as soon as we sat down.   Jonathan provided outstanding service, took the photo of us with Chef Rick Bayless and even told us some of the secrets of what he called their food;  ""Reconstructed Southern Mexican Gourmet"", as being the fresh and organic ingredients they select from local farmers.  Jonathan also helped us make some selections based on my request for ""Chef Bayless's Favorites"".    We dined on Tamal de Chivo - Banana leaf wrapped tamal(e) filled with slow cooked Pleasant Meadows Boer goat barbacoa with spicy red chile Guajilla sauce, pickled carrot-beet salad and queso anejo.   As well as a wonderfully, beautifully presented crispy Taquitos Pollo de  Ahumado filled with smoked chicken and poblanos, served with home-made sour cream (!!!!!!), salsa verde, anejo cheese and guacamole.   To add our fish we selected the Cazeula de atun cherrywood smoked Hawaiian Ahi Tuna simmered with three-chile salsa, roasted butternut and Chayote with a frisee-watercress salad.  We then ended with their final available plate of the day, Chef Bayless's own favorite, chile relleno (which does not appear to be on their menu).   In summary, Chef Bayless's cuisine is the finest Mexican style I have ever eaten, and I live in Texas, so I have had my share of mexican for decades.   I've also eaten at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill in NYC, and to me, Bayless's food is better.  And I told him that.   It has a heat level to respect, and it is true world class, and very unique.  AAA+++",0.9983,0.853,0.127,0.02,0.4906560846560845

The strawberry sorbet was a wonderful way to end our meal. The signature marg was wonderful and comes served in a martini glass. Much smaller insidethan I anticipated. The bar was very cute and so was all of the decor.,0.9735,0.78,0.197,0.023,0.5750000000000001

They had a wide variety of non-alcoholic, non soda beverages (it was 11:30, after all).  We had heard so much about their guacamole, so we had to give it a try. My guacamole that I make at home would give them a run for their money, but they lived up to their reputation. The quality of avacados was top notch. In fact, we all wondered where they got such good ones this time of year.  Needless to say, this goes way beyond your typical strip mall Mexican-American fare. I had Tacos al Carbon, with duck (duck!). The special of the day featured goat (goat!). I was disappointed they didn't have tripe tacos. That would have really freaked out the others in our party (love shock value).  The menu covered a wide range of prices, from basement bargain to splurge territories. I get the feeling that it would be hard to go wrong with this menu.  We'll have to try Topo next time.

I was turned on to this restaurant by my wife's aunt.  She knows all of the top places to eat at in Chicago.  After eating there once, I went back, again, again and again, every time I visit the windy city.  I typically order the Chiles Rellenos, which include 2 per plate, one seems to be stuffed with assorted cheeses and the other seems to be stuffed with a sweet shredded pork .  I have enjoyed all other entrees I have tried there and have never second guess any suggestions from the waiters.  Once I tried skate fish, which did not sound appealing to me, but it was terrific.   I cannot wait to try their monthly mojito drink, one time it was a fresh watermelon mojito.  The next time it was a strawberry mojito.  Although mojito's are typically made with rum, my favorite is their mojito served with Tequila!

The overall experience (including service) was 5-star, but my entree simply failed to blow me away (though I would still rate it as ""very good""). Rick Bayless was present that night (first time I had seen him there).  I find most TV chefs to be annoying to the point where I'd like to punch them in the face (and I'm not a violent person), but I rather like Rick, and don't find him annoying at all (although he certainly is odd).  His daughter was there as well, and we saw her stop and chat with several of the children who were there for the event, which I thought was very nice. The appetizers ranged from ""excellent"" to ""awesome"": -Chips, Guacamole and Salsa -Enchildas in black bean sauce -Some weird but tasty mushroom ceviche -Tuna Ceviche (awesome) -lobster/butternut squash bisque (awesomeawesomeawesome) The desserts were excellent as well: -A flaky pastry with apples and blueberries -A dark-chocolate ice cream sandwich (wow, delicious) -Some kind of almond tart My wife had the pork dish, which was smothered in a mole sauce.  She declared it ""delicious""--a word she rarely uses.  I had the flank steak, which was good, but not particularly memorable.  It was more spicy than flavorful.  My entree came with a sweet tamale which was actually more interesting than the steak itself.

Perhaps this hindered my experience in some respects. I feel that the most important thing i can tell anyone interested in trying the Frontera Grill for the first time it this: The food served here is authentic Mexican. This authenticity results in very basic, yet flavorful dishes.  I ordered guacamole, fried plantains, and chicken tacos. The guacamole was my favorite part of the meal. It was simple and perfect. The fried plantains were quite good, and i encourage people to try them. There flavor is very sweet, and when complemented with the cream offer a very bold flavor. Unfortunately the tacos were the most bland part of the meal.  My realization is this: This restaurant has wonderful atmosphere, interesting selection of foods, but in the end left me wanting more.

2008-08-19,5.0,"Patience is a virtue - and you better have a lot of it when going to Frontera Grill without a reservation.  But, I promise you, it is SOOOO worth the wait.  You might want to consider packing a baloney sandwich to munch on while waiting in line or perhaps you should bring your yoga mat and do some sun salutations in order to impress resident yogi and Chef Rick Bayless.   Frontera is simply one of my favorite restaurants on the planet.  You just have to PLAN accordingly and tell yourself  to CHILL OUT - going to Frontera is a 4-5 hour ordeal.  Example:  4 of us went there last Saturday.  We arrived at 4:15 pm - only 2 parties ahead of us waiting in line!  YESSSS!  You get in line - blab with the other drooling Rick Bayless fan club members and, of course, act all self-important when passersby ask you ""what is everyone standing in line for?""  And you say ""Frontera"" while looking them up and down as if they were the biggest dumbasses on the planet. I must admit - this was the EARLIEST we have ever been seated.  3rd in line - doors open at 5 pm - we got a table at the bar, ordered our drinks and before the drinks came our table was ready in the dining room!  I was in SHOCK!  Seated by 5:10 pm?!?!? UNHEARD OF!  Speaking of drinks, I like margaritas - I don't love them.  And I always burp them up for days......but not Frontera's margaritas.  They are the best I have ever had -must be the great quality tequila.  Fabooooo! We proceed to order food that is so fresh, so flavorful, it is otherworldly - TO DIE FOR.  My partner, who likes to pretend she is a healthy eater had as an appetizer:   Trio, Trio, Trio: a sampling of Ceviche Fronterizo, Ceviche Yucateco and Ceviche Playero.  Ceviche Fronterizo is lime-marinated Hawaiian blue marlin with tomatoes, olives, cilantro, jícama and green chile; served on crispy tostaditas.  Ceviche Yucateco: steamed organic shrimp and calamari tossed with lime, orange, habanero, avocado, jícama and cilantro.  Maine ""dry pack"" scallops, Alaskan king crab, Honey Manila mango, Mexican papaya, pineapple and jicama with Oaxacan pasilla, grapefruit, lime and garlic. Plantain tostada.   SO FRESH!!!  With so many tantalizing flavors.  YUM! We also ordered as appetizers: Queso Fundido Clasico: Samuel's artisanal Jack cheese with garlicky roasted peppers, homemade chorizo sausage and oregano, and Taquitos de Pollo: crispy taquitos filled with chicken and poblanos, with homemade sour cream, salsa verde, añejo cheese and guacamole.  We also ordered (yes, we are piggies - so STFUP) the ""special"" immediately upon sitting down.  BELIEVE me when I say that the minute your waiter comes to your table and says ""We have a special tonight but we only have a few left......"" don't even let him/her finish - just say ""YES!  We want one.""  The special appetizer that night was 2 chili rellenos - one pork, one cheese.  OMG  Sublime........... For dinner we ordered: Poc Chuc de Puerco: lime-marinted Maple Creek pork shoulder with traditional Yucatecan garnishes (tomatoes, avocado, grill-roasted onions, Napa cabbage), spicy habanero salsa and black beans ""colados.""  Salmon con Verduras a la Nata: wood-grilled Alaskan king salmon with roasted chayote, guero chle and caramelized onion in thick, slow-cooked ""nata"" (thick cream) White rice.  Carne Asada ""Brava"": serrano-marinated grass fed rib steak (from Bill Kurtis's Tall Grass) with salsa de molcajete (hand-crushed roasted tomatoes, serranos and garlic), spicy seared chiles toreados and sweet corn tamales (topped with homemade sour cream and fresh cheese. We also ordered a special Mahi Mahi entree - SO tasty and melted in your mouth! Now, I am going to be honest - I was very sad because for the first time ever I did not like my entree which was the aforementioned pork shoulder.  It was NOT their fault - I just chose something that was soaked in lime marinade - WAYYYYY too tart for me.  I like a hint of lime - I don't want it to overwhelm the pork.  So, THANK GOD we ordered so many appetizers - I left very full - and my friends picked at the pork. For dessert, I had the oh-so-rich Chocolate Pecan pie with whipped cream.  WOW!   We also had various coffees including my FAVORITE coffee on the planet  - the Mexican press pot coffee concocted for Frontera by Intelligentsia coffee.   OMG - for this alone, I would crawl thru the desert................

Since this place doesn't take reservations, I knew it would be key to visit the restaurant on a weekday right when they open.  We got there about 11:45 and were able to find seats in the bar. Seating setup is unfriendly for odd-numbered groups (seats were in twos and fours), but the staff let us push two tables together - saving the three of us from huddling around a table meant for two.

I think they were understaffed, because the lunch crowd seemed manageable, yet we had to wait for 45 minutes before we got our appetizers. I split the Entrems Surtido appetizer platter and pork tacos with my friend. I HIGHLY recommend the appetizer platter. It lets you try mini portions of their quesadillas, chicken taquitos, ceviche tostadas and jcama salad. Because I was thinking of ordering each of these items for my entree, the appetizer platter let me try all the dishes and still try something else! My favorite was the jicama salad - it had mangoes and the tangy dressing provided a nice complement to the sweet mangoes and crunchy jicama.  Even though we had to wait again for our entrees, it was definitely worth it! The pork was marinated to perfection. Featuring notes of red chile, pineapple, bacon and onion, it was a fiesta in my mouth. Each ingredient balanced the others. Seriously, it was friggin' awesome. I'm not a big meat eater, but I will gladly eat a whole bowl of this stuff everyday if I could. We were also served six tortillas so it's perfect to split. I will be back to Frontera Grill.

The atmosphere is bright and noisy, with colorfully painted walls and artwork.  If you're the type who feels a bit of sensory overload (as I do), you should opt for a later lunch; it was noticeably quieter by 2:00. We shared the ceviche trio as a starter, which for me was the highlight of the meal; very crisp fresh flavors in sweet and tangy marinades that complemented the natural taste of the seafood (cod, blue marlin, shrimp, and calamari) without overwhelming. Be warned that  because of the soupy nature of the ceviches (served with tortilla chips) they are slightly awkward to share and are ideal for 2, not more to share.  I would have happily kicked back the leftover ceviche juice like a shot, but held back because I was with our company president. (Sigh.) For my main course I got the fish of the day which was salmon, grilled perfectly, medium rare. I would have like the fish as it was with little adornment, however there was a cheese and mushroom sauce ladled (overly) generously over the fish.  The sauce was fine but reminiscent of a watered down cheese dip with mushrooms mixed in. It just wasn't the ideal complement for the salmon.  I enjoyed the accompanying arborio rice as well as the green beans, but wanted more than the dollop of greens provided.  (Healthy Hedonist likes her veggies!)   To complete my meal I chose the hot chocolate, and  unfortunately the supposedly ""Oaxacan"" style hot chocolate was overly milky with just the faintest hint of cocoa and a  pinch of cinnamon on top. This did not taste at all like the intensely cinnamonny hot chocolate I've had in Mexico, nor like the cocoa-rich concoctions typical of a fancy restaurant or good coffee shop.   A James Beard winner can surely pull out a better cocoa to end the meal on.",0.9969,0.759,0.221,0.02,0.6025694444444446

Never really been a huge fan of Mexican food, but decided to give this a shot since it's technically ""Nueva Latino"" and my friend loves brunch here.  I ordered the recommended special of Mahi Mahi, which wasn't bad but the tomatina sauce was too strong and overpowered the fish... there wasn't a right balance. Plus, it felt more like a heavy dinner than light brunch. Our waiter was gracious about giving us more of the spiced nuts (which, sadly, were much tastier than my entree). I tried the Sapitas too, but they failed to impress. And I would have appreciated if the waiter told us that the special was double the price of their other dishes... which I found out the hard way. So, ehhh. Would I come here again? Unlikely. I'd rather try other places in Chicago next time I visit.",0.9912,0.678,0.259,0.062,0.4450091575091575

Alright we finally get a table....and WHAT!  What, a self respecting Mexican restaurant doesn't give you at least one free basket of chips, SACRILEGE! HERESY!  Though they did give some really yummy seasoned nuts, I had to order the chips, there is no way you can judge a Mexican place without tasting their chips, and they were pretty good, a little thick for my taste, but freshly fried in their kitchen, definitely not from a bag.  Good salsas too.  One smokey chili one and a tangy tomatillo one.    For our second starter we had the fish enchiladas and the tamales with butternut and cheese.  Both were very good.  Enchiladas, had a nice green tomatillo sauce.  The masa on the tamale was nice and moist, but not too moist, but like many tamales there was too much of it.  Both ends of the tamale were all masa no filling.  The filling was quite good when you finally got to it and it all was tied together quite well with the mole. And for our main course we shared the duck.  The duck was cooked very well, still nice and tender, not a dried mess.  The fresh tortillas accompanying it were excellent, and made great little duck tacos, though I thought the pickled onions included were too strong to go with the duck.  The rustic mashed potatoes were excellent too, very garlicly and buttery. Too full for dessert, we had try hot chocolate (or ""chockies"" an they are known in some circles).  Best hot chocolate ever. Good mix of chocolate ans other spices/nuts/whatever else.  If i ever lose all my teeth, I am going to survive on Michelada and chockies form Frontera. Other than the whole chip thing and the wait thing, my biggest complaint about Frontera was the service, which was a bit sub-par.  Our water glasses were consistently neglected, though the pitcher circled the room a number of times.  Our appetizer dishes stayed on the table kinda long, though they did replace our flatware between courses, which is always nicer that using them for both courses.  And I don't remember being asked how my food was. But the food was good, so I guess that can make up for it, some.   I do feel weird having such great Mexican food made by such a gringo, but so it goes I guess.  Hey who can forget Diana Kennedy!",0.9988,0.737,0.219,0.044,0.5183602150537635

Though I'm not sure if the people I dined with would agree.  We showed up kind of late on a Saturday afternoon expecting to have lunch... after we waited an hour and a half (we walked to Merchandise Mart and back) we had a margarita and we were finally seated.  Then we learned it was a brunch menu.  This was a bit disappointing to everyone--particularly since it was 2PM by now.  I scoured the menu to find something without eggs but there were only 2 or 3 options.  I ended picking the Sapitos, which actually did have eggs but the waitress said it was one of her favorite things.   They were indeed amazing!!   The margaritas here--as always--are TOP NOTCH.  They have a number of different ways to order them, my recommendation is the middle of the road option where it's shaken and served straight up in a martini ($8 each).  One of the best margaritas I've ever had.  They also have one that has a smokey flavor, is pink, and served straight up in a martini ($10). It was very very tasty too. I don't really know if the others at the table really thought their food was ""all that"" ... The mole was good... though probably not that memorable.   Our friend had a bean stew that I don't know if she liked much.  Another had an aztec egg dish that looked like it might be good but probably too much egg--she didn't eat half of it. The service to me was ""just OK"" ... It was good when she was there though.  It was also nice to see Rick Bayless actually walking around and doing things in his restaurant.  We even snapped a pic w/ him.

Their reservations policy is confusing and sometimes perhaps even inconsistent.  For lunch they apparently take reservations for all parties. For dinner they only take reservations for groups of 5-10, but if you call early in the morning they take a few same day reservations for smaller parties for dinner.  I've tried twice though and both times I've called around 9am and it was already for the day.   (P.S., I posted some pictures of our food in the pics).",0.9966,0.815,0.16,0.025,0.5268961352657006

I guess the server wanted to challenge my fiance because he came back with a small dish filled with some other type of salsa.  Our server told him ""I notice you like spicy stuff I brought you this salsa let's hope this is hot enough for you.""  The salsa consisted of chile de arbol with lime juice and boy was it spicy but soooooooo good.  I'll be honest when I first read the menu I thought well this sounds like my mom can do this.  I thought the steak would be a skirt steak....

I had one sip and found it to be not meant for human consumption.  Then again I can't stand bloody mary's.  My golden margarita was pretty meh.  The tequila was smooth but it was very small, like in a high ball glass and the mixers made the whole drink seem watered down.

We got there at 9:00 and did not get our food until 10:45.  The margaritas were really sour and the salmon dish is raw, which they fail to mention in their menu description.  The restaurant was really hot and because the service was so bad, it made for a really uncomfortable night.  I do not recomend Frontera at all, if you are looking for good margaritas and decent food, settle with blue agave at rush and division.  It's predictable and in a great area and you'll get your tex-mex fix",-0.5399,0.817,0.078,0.105,0.49249084249084246
2007-08-10,4.0,"My boyfriend and I tried Frontera Grill last night for date night; we had a reservation and were seated within 2 minutes!  Great first impression with the atmosphere - colorful, vibrant Mexican decor, loud/crowded, and amazing aroma of Mexican food.  (I'm Mexican so what can I say, I love the smell of frying tortilla chips!)  The hostess and wait staff were very attentive.  We had at least 3 different waiters take our drink orders, refill water, and take food orders.  Drinks were brought out promptly, and may I say the margaritas were fabulous.  I'm a no-frills margarita girl, so the Blue Agave was awesome: tequila, lime, a splash of Cointreau.  My bf tried the ""Yellow Fever"" (tecate, tequila, some kind of mango juice...basically a summer special and it was not so good).  Stick with the margaritas. The appetizers were awesome - Ceviche Fronteriza (marinated fish with tomatoes, cilantro, lime, and chiles) was very tasty.  Chips with guacamole and salsa were just ok.  The guac could have used a little more punch and the salsa bowls were so small you couldn't even fit a whole chip in them.   The food was average - pork with adobo marinated rub, bacon, pineapple...it was ok, not the best.  I had the skirt steak tacos, which were much better.  The steak was cooked to perfection, and rolled up in fresh homemade tortillas and grilled onions and salsa - hard to go wrong! All in all I'd give the food a 3, the margaritas a 4, and the company/atmosphere a 5!",0.9892,0.794,0.169,0.037,0.49132653061224496

Well, I had one of the worst dinning experiences I have ever had here. After waiting in line for an hour to get a seat, even though they told me on the phone that we had a reservation for 9 and there would not be a wait of more than 10 minutes, we were seated by an extremely rude host, and then sat for approximately  25 minutes without so much as a hello from any of the staff. It was like we were not there. We finally had to flag down a waitress to get water and menus. Eventually some one came and took our drink and appetizer order, which was served promptly, but no came back for the rest of our order for almost a half hour (some one did fill our water during that time) Once the waitress showed back up and took our order, it was almost 45 minutes before we were served our food or asked if we needed another drink. Once we had finished our meal, it took almost half an hour for some one to realize that our table needed to be be busses. All of this was going on as Rick Bayless was sitting about 20 feet away from us at the counter.

2007-07-21,5.0,"I can think of no better way to kick off a vacation than with an exceeded expectation by Rick Bayless' Frontera Grill, which has been lauded as the best upscale Mexican in the country. Though we barely put a dent in the menu, we liked what we saw and first impressions matter most. My gal pal wasn't feeling up to a full meal and ordered the Jicama Cellejera ($4.50), which was an appetizer-sized portion of sliced cucumbers and jicama dusted with achiote, lime, and pineapple juice. Some of the jicama pieces on top were doused with the overpowering spiciness and GC ate all of the pineapple pieces before I could try the dish in its entirety. My incomplete verdict is to render the dish nothing too special, though the combination of peppery achiote, tangy sweet pineapple, and tart lime was interesting. Each summer Bayless' chefs take a one-week reprieve from the restaurant to go on a work-related, culinary research excursion. This year they made it down to the Yucatan--where the cosmopolitan cuisine takes notes from both Mexican and Western influences--and came back with an amendment of especialidades for the menu. For JH and I, this meant a traditional achiote grilled fish or Pescado Tikin Xik ($17), served with a roasted tomato-habanero salsa, Mexican rice, and pea tendrils.  Warm corn tortillas were brought on the side.  Achiote paste is a common marinade found in Yucatean cuisine and is a combination of annatto (what gives it its fiery red color), cumin, oregano, garlic, pepper, cloves, cinnamon, and allspice.   The banana-leaf grilling method led to an incredibly moist and succulent filet of mahi mahi, while the achiote rub gave it a deep smoke and pepperiness.  There was added heat from the habanero in the salsa, while the acidity in the tomatoes cooled it all down.  The Mexican rice was aromatic with notes of ancho chile powder and the pea tendrils was crisp and lightly dressedThe dish was both my friend and foe--enraging my taste buds at first and soothing them after.  Though I would have liked for the flan to be creamier, I was impressed by the infusion of lime and dragon fruit that really sang from within the layers of egg, milk, and sugar in the Flan de Pitaya ($7.50).  The raspberry-guanabana salsa took the pucker out of tart and left only a fresh sweetness to awaken the taste buds.  The restaurant was packed for a 2pm lunch seating and with its vibrant food and festive atmosphere, I can certainly see why.",0.9894,0.868,0.113,0.019,0.39711029711029716

A tip:  If the restaurant is full and there's a long wait, check out the bar area.  There's a bunch of seating there and I was able to get in with a group of 8 people with no wait over there.  The food is the same, and you're closer to the bar!",0.4489,0.81,0.1,0.089,0.5695238095238095

Two of the three times I have eaten here I have had the tacos al carbon (pastor style).  This is an item I have eaten at dozens of taquerias over the years.  Frontera's is not only the best I have ever had, it elevates the dish to another level.

Second, the food - flavors and quality of food are amazing.  we had sopes (one of my favorites) and yes they are quite tiny but there is so much flavor.  I had pork loin with glazed potatoes and a mini salad, FI had carne asada which was not pounded as flat as i normally have had it, it was more steak-like in texture (at least when cooked medium rare), plantains with goat cheese (OMG so good). by the by the margaritas are not my favorite, but that is a personal choice.  I like mine less sweet and more tart.  However they are made very well. Third, atmosphere - i love the bar area and wish we could have arrived earlier for a drink first.  I would have frankly preferred to eat in here (also, i am more of a bar person).  Our table in the dining room, which is small, was a two-top and very rickety.  Not cool, guys!  FI's margarita almost spilled.  However the decor is nice and it is lively. so one appetizer, four drinks, two entrees, tip = about $110.  not cheap, but once in a while for a meal like this, is ok. i would go back to sit in the bar and avoid the reservation or waiting in line nonsense.  you get the same menu there.",0.9921,0.804,0.15,0.046,0.4306478405315615

Furthermore, I can't understand why anyone would complain about price.  THIS is what fine dining is.  Food is more expensive, and if you don't like it, don't eat here.  In my experience, you pay for what you get.  Tonight, my duck breast was perfectly cooked, and duck is very hard to do perfectly, and I understand that in order to experience this, I had to pay for it.  It's not hard to suss out restaurant information these days--do some homework before you go, so you won't be shocked at the wait, or so you won't bug out over the prices. Anyway, I like the food.  The desserts tonight weren't great, but I've had great desserts on other occasions.  The appetizer platter didn't fail to delight (again!), and as I said, my duck entree was fantastic.  I'd highly recommend a side order of mashed potatoes to everyone, because they're just delicious.  (So are the black beans; if your dish doesn't come with those, try those as well.)  Everyone at the table seemed to like their food; my boyfriend said his carne asada was the best he's ever had it at Frontera.

2006-07-21,5.0,"Bayless is an amazing chef and has groomed numerous other now amazing Mexican chefs who've worked for him over the years in Chicago.  Frontera Grill has been open since 1987 yet every night you walk in and it has all the buzz of a hyped up place on it's grand opening night, and also all the friendliness, cleanliness and style of a new place.  Seems that he knows how to treat his staff as I'd guess 90% of them are still happy working there for the entire 6 years that I've been visiting.  You truly cannot go wrong on the menu here, but I often order simple classics like tamales, chicken with mole, or tacos al carbon just to remind myself how wonderfully flavorful Rick's team can execute creation of such seemingly simple things.   Don't go here with an expectation or plan of eating quickly.  You'll likely wait in line for a table even if you show up at their 5pm opening time.  Eating here IS a privilege and when the food finally comes to your table, you'll want to stay longer and spend time appreciating it.   I'm pretty sure he's not of Mexican decent but Rick has perhaps studied more about Mexican culture and spent more time in Mexico than many Mexican Americans.  I understand that he closes his adjoining restaurants Topolobompo/Frontera Grill in Chicago for at least an entire week each year in order to fly every one of his restaurant staff members to Mexico for an expense paid vacation/cultural immersion and food exploration.  The service people here are so knowledgeable and professional, they make every visit great even when it's too crowded to walk to the bar.  I can't wait to visit Chicago once again just to dine at Frontera Grill.  Rick please open 1 more restaurant in northern California for those of us now living on the west coast!",0.9943,0.838,0.162,0.0,0.5763718534551868
2006-05-25,5.0,"This was my second visit to both Chicago and the Frontera Grill.  Both occasions were for business so luckily, I was on the company dime.  This visit we were seated right next to Rick and Deann Groen Bayless which made it all that more special.  The mojitos were awesome and so was everything else I tasted.  You can't go wrong eating at Frontera.  If there ever is a third trip, business or not, to Chicago in my future, I will be back at the Frontera Grill.",0.9311,0.849,0.151,0.0,0.405952380952381

2006-04-08,5.0,"After moving to Chicago from San Francisco, this was the first place I went since I was a huge fan of Mexico One Plate at a Time.  I thought it would be easy to get a table at 5:10pm, a mere 10 minutes after the place opened, but I was wrong.  We walked in the door and it was already a 60 minute wait, which wasn't a big deal because I just sat at the bar and enjoyed some delicious Margaritas and chips.  Once we got our table I had a pretty good buzz but that didn't prevent me from enjoying a great meal.  Everything on the menu is great, however I would recommend eating from the small plates menu, that way everyone gets to taste a little bit of everything that is ordered.  All in all a very successful evening.",0.9929,0.675,0.293,0.032,0.6791666666666667
2006-03-15,2.0,"Ok maybe I just like super Americanized food but I thought this place was terrible!! The food for one was wayyy overpriced. My friend ordered a quesadilla appetizer and she received 3 bite sized pieces of dough filled with American cheese. They were served to her on a napkin too! I'm sorry but if this is ""trendy"" than I never want to eat at another trendy restaurant again! The margaritas were pretty much all mix, tiny and really expensive!!

2006-01-21,3.0,"Ok...get ready to drop some MAJOR cash if you're looking to dine at this establishment.  The food is amazing...but you are certianly paying a premium becuase it's a Rick Bayless restaurant.  I don't think that you will find a place that will charge you more for premium tequila.  This is some of the best Mexican fare you will find, however, and is a great place to go in the Summer due to the outdoor seating.  Be well prepared to wait a LONG time for a table if you visit the restaurant during peak hours.  They also charged us $4 a shot for Sangrita.  Sangrita has no alcohol, and is made from tomato juice and orange juice.  (boo hoo, right?)",0.8658,0.831,0.119,0.049,0.42896825396825394

2005-09-23,5.0,"Check out those herbs growing in the planters right outside, because they'll be on your plate.  Today we had a chilled halibut appetizer, shoulder of lamb, and pork tamales.  The tamales included some shredded chorizo and pineapple, served on banana leaves - the cornbread or corn dough (what is the correct term?) was incredibly light and flavorful!  Dessert was dark chocolate cake with creme filling and fruit, but Husband had some kind of lame blueberry ice cream since he can't handle rich chocolate - actually it was good too.  What would be an amazing Mexican meal without the kick-ass Topolo margarta, shaken at the table - orange flavor with mint leaves.  Wow.  The best service.  Got out of there for $85 including tax/tip.  It was part of our 9th wedding anniversary day-together-without-kids celebration.",0.9351,0.795,0.143,0.062,0.5373626373626373
