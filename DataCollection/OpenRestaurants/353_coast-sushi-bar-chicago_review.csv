2017-08-23,1.0,"Don't ever order take-out from here... Worst experience I've ever had from any restaurant in the city! First off, I never give bad reviews but this one is very warranted.  I'll start off by saying that Coastal came up as the top rated sushi place near the location I was at, so figured it was going to be amazing!  Quite the contrary... it took almost 2-hours for them to deliver my food due to it being ""a super busy night at the restaurant"" (which was on a Tuesday night mind you).  I called the restaurant twice within a 40-minute period after my order was already late -- and both times, the extremely rude hostess said she would call the driver to see where he was at, and said she'd call me back... and I never received one phone call from her or anyone else!  The driver finally showed up at 8:50pm (and I placed my order just after 7:15pm). When it finally arrived, I was shocked to see the tiny-little bag containing my order... It was the smallest amount of food that I've ever seen for a $70+ order, and I even had to make a frozen pizza afterwards for my group because we were still starving.  And overall, the sushi wasn't all that great.   Not sure why there are so many good reviews of this place, but my experience with this restaurant was the absolute worst one I've ever had in my life, no joke!  Grubhub/Eat24 tried making it ""better"" by offering me $2 off on my next order.  This to me is such a joke!  Won't be using them on any future orders for a while either.",-0.2973,0.82,0.094,0.087,0.5631687242798354
2017-08-18,5.0,"Rated as one of the best sushi places in Chicago and I tend to agree. My go-to's are Rollapalooza and Sushi Para since I live in Wrigleyville. I came here on a Tuesday night with my girlfriend so it wasn't that crowded and we didn't have to wait for a table.  The ambience is dark and cozy so it's a solid place for a date. I am not a picky sushi eater so I thought the sushi was very good! We had edamame, sashimi plate, smokin pumpkin roll, rainbow roll, and spicy tuna roll. Yes we were starving! I thought the sashimi was fresh and the rolls were flavorful.  The prices were standard sushi prices for Chicago, which are always a tad expensive. But this isn't McDonalds. Being BYOB with no bottle fee is a plus too. I would definitely recommend Coast Sushi!",0.9505,0.81,0.156,0.034,0.453

I'm not a stick in the mud, but my husband and I could barely hear each other over their screaming and laughing. They were there when we sat down,  nursing their bottle of wine and we're still sitting there when we left. The food was great,  but about halfway through our meal we definitely picked up the pace just to get out of there so we could enjoy actually having a conversation again.

2017-06-19,4.0,"Coast serves what I call ""U.S. Sushi""  (which bears little or no resemblance to sushi served in Japan.)   If you're looking for those perfect ""one bite wonders"", this ain't yo' type of place, OK?   However, they get 10 points because they had like one dude preparing sushi that ""appeared"" to be Asian and perhaps a server or two as well.   But when all is said and done, Coast's ""US Sushi"" rocks. Their signature maki selection is inventive, seasonal, and full of all those americanized things that many folks crave in their  rolls (think cream cheese, smoked salmon, jalapeno, & mayo) .  A few specials highlight their ingenuity of ingredient combos.  Make sure you charge your phone, because even if you're a millennial, you won't be able to read the menu without using the light on your phone.  The cavern-like, pitch dark atmosphere is not meant for reading.  The candle on the table won't help you.  Also be prepared to speak loudly.  This is not a place for date night.....(unless of course you don't want to hear what your date has to say).  The Coast folks have nailed what their target audience thinks and wants when they hear the word  ""sushi"".  Bucktown, Evanston, & S.

I really don't try to expect much of Chicago sushi since we're quite far from the ports, but it was good nonetheless.  Nothing at all fishy, nice firm, but giving texture.  They definitely don't put enough wasabi onto them (trying to err on the side of caution, I suppose), but the rice is good.  Their chirashi is okay.   Sure, they're a bit expensive, but you can at least offset the cost by bringing your own booze.

I ordered pickup and was estimated 20-25 minutes until it was ready.

The icing on the cake was that I became extremely ill from the food and spent all night and this morning wishing I never ate sushi. I am not sure if it was the salmon, shrimp tempura, or the octopus that got me sick but I have a feeling it might have been the salmon. My husband was also sick but not nearly as bad as me which is why I believe it was the salmon as I ate a majority of the shrimp pieces and my husband only had two.

Finally returned home to crack open the containers that held 2 spicy tuna, a philly, unagi and my seaweed salad.  The spicy tuna was great! The salmon in the philly roll was fishy though we had one piece and decided it would be best to not take the chance of eating the rest. The unagi was chewy and dried out. It would seem as if we were given the sushi without care to attention. It's hard to say, but I have had great sushi in the city and absolutely terrible sushi. This wasn't the worst but I am disappointed in the quality. With a lil more attention to detail I feel like our night could have been saved.

To start, we ordered the tuna tartare. The tuna was fresh and the sesame chip that came with it paired wonderfully. For the rolls, I ordered the special ""Firecracker"" (recommended by our waitress). We also ordered the White Dragon and the Po' Boy. All the rolls were excellent, but my favorite was definitely the Firecracker (I recommend it if you like a little kick to your rolls). For dessert- because clearly we hadn't eaten enough, we ordered the Mochi Ice Cream chocolate chip and the chocolate coconut. Both were excellent and super light and refreshing to eat, but my favorite was definitely the chocolate chip. Plating was excellent for all the dishes, and the ambiance with the himalayan salt candle holders on each table was very relaxing. Overall I would recommend checking this place out, because I most definitely will be back.",0.9982,0.676,0.308,0.016,0.6110837438423645

All good but the only one that stood out in my mind was the White Dragon Roll (and its the most filling!).

FOOD: Excuse my lack of culture, but this was my first time trying YakiSoba and I'm glad Intried it here. A hearty and well-textured dish. Between the perfectly al dente feel of the noodles, the light crunch of the veggies, and the juicy shrimp, I loved every bite. Again, very textured and dynamic dish.  The miso soup was spicy and I loved it! I felt like he soup wasn't made from a powdered, generic stock, like many misos are. It felt authentic and careful.

The hostesses asked if we had reservations and we said no, she said they were waiting on a couple of people who did have #reservations and for us to have a seat. If those reservations were not fulfilled we should be seated soon...worry then accompanied my growling stomach. We were hoping this was not a similar ploy, pretentious #Chicago night clubs do by having people wait in line on an empty bar, in hope to perceive popularity.  Since it was my first time there, I took the opportunity to enjoy the #Asian Art on the waiting room walls of beautiful cherry blossom trees, considering we did just come from an art class. Alas, after a short 5 minute wait, a soft calming voice said, please follow me to your table. #Score! Star #1 check! We were seated at our table with a tall glass of ice water poured to enjoy as we browsed the #menu. My girlfriend had given up drinking a few months back and since this place is #BYOB even a more perfect way to keep the extra sake calories at bay. I saved my would have been #martini calories for the evening's #sushi specials. A friendly bearded waiter approach to take our order along with announce the sushi specials of the evening were a summer roll and a the #firecracker #maki. Done, order that up along with the 12 piece #sashimi plate. Star #2 belongs to great wait staff here. After an #intimate conversation on #life amidst #Coast's low lit ambience our #culinary master pieces arrive. First thought was wow, second was #yum and third was nom, nom, nom! They serve a very generous portion and more than enough for your belly's content! Star #3 goes to #food presentation. After the first #bite of the firecracker roll, the only letter my lips could murmur were mmmmmmm! The firecracker roll is a crisp delight for the raw and cooked #sushi lovers. Second bite went to the #summer roll and can we say refreshing! Highly recommend trying both of these.

Not sure what was up with that. I normally like dim lighting in restaurants but here I felt it was trying to be sexy, but ended up being just dark. BYOB is always a plus though.

Sushi was fishy tasting and not the best that I've had in the area. Service was fast but I have to say the servers and front desk people, while kind, just seemed to be going through the motions. I felt rushed and there was no ""warmth"" from them. Very much a production type of place. I would not recommend this restaurant. There are far better places in Bucktown that go over and above and want your business. Coast felt to me like they could care less and with an attitude like this, you better have exceptional food- and they did not.

I found it hard to pick maki rolls since it didn't sound interesting or it had cream cheese.     The good: - BYOB with no corkage fee  - the Coast Crab roll was great and the dragon roll was good too - The tuna on top special roll was not too really spicy...but it was good. - the bbq eel nigiri was pretty good.  the meh: - the food came out slower than expected. - there were too many rolls with cream cheese on the menu. I guess it made it easy to narrow down. - The tuna on top special roll was not too memorable...it was ok. - Ceviche roll was a bit of a let down.  - the salmon and a Hamachi rolls were okay.  - it's a tad pricey for what you get for certain rolls.,0.9815,0.742,0.216,0.042,0.5179159318048208

It has the sushi bar and open seating in the dining area. We went for dinner and it was a very ""romantic"" dim lighting. It wasn't too loud so you can carry a conversation without yelling at one another.  Food: We started with the asparagus beef as a starter, it was delicious. The sauce was along  the lines of teriyaki and the beef was thin and tender , similar to that of bulgogi. As for rolls, I had the Firecracker which was off the menu (kind of expensive was $19 for the roll, didn't know until i received the bill). It had a bit of a kick to it since it had spicy tuna and jalapeños, but very tolerable for those who don't eat spicy food (I have a very low tolerance for spicy).  My cousin had a dragon roll and it was different than most I've had, it had more crunch to it which could be due to the seasame seeds in it. Either way, delicious. And for dessert green tea ice cream and mochi, better than store bought but nothing out of the ordinary compared to other Japanese restaurants.  Service: Overall, decent.

Until i tried Coast, that is.  2 friends of mine asked me if I wanted to get sushi with them, and I immediately came up with why I wasn't able to. They convinced me to at least come and try it out, and knowing I could at least have some sort of noodle soup, I obliged. I decided to try sushi yet again, hoping this would be the time it clicked for me. I told the server I had never been a sushi eater, but I was willing to try a roll. She recommended the spicy sweet tomato roll with tempura flakes. Let it be known, I think my experience at Coast could have turned me into a sushi lover.

A $100 dinner (no cocktails) for three people, then leaving unsatisfied---that left a worst taste in my mouth than a piece of bad tuna!  Coast, you had always been my fave fair-priced sushi spot in the city. I had boasted your previously fabulous paced service, and deliciously solid maki selection and execution. Tonight I visited with to my boyfriend and his sister, who was visiting us, and we all left feeling pretty ""meh."" We ordered tuna tartar, edamame, and spicy miso to start, then ordered six rolls to share. Here's where it went wrong:  - The biggest issue: they were all heavy rice to fish ratio. Way to much rice makes sushi taste like paste. No good.  - What the heck are you doing? The poppy texture of the roe was lost because the chefs blended the masago into the rice. What? Why?!  -The volcano roll had a nice flavor, but an excessive explosion of crunchy tempura crumbs, and it really needed a drizzle of sauce. -Our tuna tartar was warm. Everywhere I have ever been serves this potentially amazing taster chilled. Which is how I imagined it should be. The mild flavor, and kitschy rice/sesame ""cracker"" it was served with reminded me of grocery store take on poke from Hawaii. Not amazing, not terrible. Left us feeling lukewarm.  -We went on a Thursday, hoping for a quieter crowd, and that did not happen. The restaurant was very busy, and very noisy. No music to be heard. no relaxation. I know that busy is usually a sign of a good thing, but it honestly just added to my frustration.  Will I go back? Probably not.

The gyoza was simple and delicious, as was the dipping sauce. Neither my friend, nor I had been huge sushi fans prior to this occasion but the spicy tuna changed us. The flavors were balanced perfectly and the texture was perfect. For our main courses, she had the combination tempura dinner and I had the seared tuna. She raved about hers, particularly the corn/fish piece. Mine was absolutely delicious. The soba was in a light, nutty sauce that went perfectly with the sweet, tangy, ginger tuna, and the caramelized sweet potato wedges added a nice touch.

The sushi is decent, probably one of the better places in my area. I will say that some of the more 'popular' dishes (like white dragon for e.g.) caters to pseudo sushi enthusiast, it is coated in thick sauces and has very little focus on the actual fish. If you're into that then go ahead and order it. If you actually enjoy fresh fish textures and taste I would look at the smaller less expensive side of the menu and try some of those. I really enjoyed the Spicy Tako!

It's a good place for groups, so there were a lot of loud tables, which made it nearly impossible to hold a conversation with someone across the table. It's not a good place for a date night.

The rolls were very tasty yet the spicy mayo could be a bit more defined. A few rolls I had tried were a bit on the steeper price side yet you only received about 6 rolls per. For 8-13$ I'd expect at least 8 small sized ones and 6 larger ones. But they were good so who cares. 48$ for two pre tax is a bit much WITHOUT booze.

I'm also picky and order my rolls with no roe - no masago, no tobiko - and it's never a problem. I've been other sushi places where they add it on anyways and instead of remaking the rolls, just scrape part of it off.  Some of the best rolls are the volcano and white dragon, but you really can't go wrong with any of them. And their miso soup is the best I've ever had!

The signature menu is the only one I don't find terribly appealing, we gravitate toward the same few every meal. Where this place loses points in my book is service. Attentive at first, it always drops off a cliff the moment the food arrives. On our last dinner, I don't even think we even saw our server after our food arrived and a different server altogether dropped our check. Predictable and good for a BYOB sushi joint.

We were expecting it to ""pop"" somehow but it lacked everything that would make it do so. At $19 it was quite disappointing. Wish we had known or been told what it cost before ordering it. As for ambiance, the place looks cool and the dim lighting gives it a very intimate feel. However that intimate feel is lost in about 5 minutes after you sit down due to the noise; the place is LOUD.  You literally need to shout to be heard across the table.

First, even though we had a reservation (it was even early at 6:30), there was a wait.  I understand that can happen, but there were empty tables in the dining rooms and yet tons of people waiting.  False waits to create lines just makes me insane and I am a bit concerned that is their practice.  The hostess was not rude, but was also not very friendly either. However, the experience improved once we were seated.  Our waitress was attentive and friendly.  We ordered the gyoza, shrimp tempura,  and a salmon special to order. My favorite would have been the salmon special. It tasted fresh and had great flavor.  We also got in several suhsi rolls, including the salmon, tuna, a spicy tuna/crab special, and white dragon (spicy shrimp) rolls. They were good and filing but nothing spectacular.  Some of them seemed like the sauce overpowered the fish.  It also took a bit longer to get the rolls. Also note: they came out all at once and not one by one.  The tab was about $80 for two and seems to fall in that mid-line sushi range that doesn't break the bank.",0.9844,0.775,0.173,0.052,0.5312042124542125

2014-04-06,1.0,"I used to love Coast, I had been a few times and dined in the restaurant and thought the rolls were great!  However, last night a few girlfriends and I decided to order from Coast as it was nearby my friends new apartment.  We ordered, received our food in a decent amount of time and then proceeded to open up the rolls and find that the spicy scallop roll was a blueish color.  It did NOT look appetizing.  My friend was brave enough to try one anyways--took one bite and looked a little sick.  At that point, we noticed the spicy tuna looked a little strange too--just a little off, like it was fish possibly gone bad or too old.  I tasted one of those and it did not taste good at all.   We paid 80 dollars for 4 rolls and an entree--so, I would expect the sushi to be very good.  I get that delivery might not be quite as fresh or great of an experience as eating in the restaurant--but we shouldn't be gagging over our sushi.   We called the restaurant and asked them to refund our money for the 'bad' rolls only (everything else was fine).   The woman that we talked to told us that we would need to bring the rolls back in.   Really?  We order sushi for a celebratory dinner and it tastes disgusting and we have to bring it back??  We asked if the delivery driver could come back and pick up the rolls and she said no.  I get they are trying to cover their bases to make sure people don't just call up and complain and ask for money back even after eating the rolls--but we clearly didn't eat anything and offered to give the rolls back.  Because we were so angry over this (and needed to get a new dinner anyways), we drove the rolls BACK to the restaurant.  The woman at the desk went away for about 20 minutes, came back and grudgingly gave us our money back for those three rolls all the while acting like we did something wrong.  I have a huge problem with this.  It is not our fault that the sushi delivered to us was disgusting and inedible.  At no point did we receive an apology or anything of the sort.  Instead everyone that we encountered or talked to acted like WE had done something wrong.   I definitely will not be returning to Coast again.  There are too many other good sushi places in the city with much fresher fish, better prices and that do not treat customers in the way we were treated",0.6372,0.806,0.101,0.093,0.4963485125985124

2014-03-30,4.0,"Coast Sushi is regarded as one of Chicago's top mid-range sushi restaurants often compared to Sushi Toro, Friends Sushi et al, and while I couldn't find anything to complain about this place, something left me feeling not as satisfied as I do after dining with the competition, mostly because I was expecting something different.   To start with where Coast Sushi is better than the others is the size of the restaurant (easier to get a table and they take reservation), a refined ambiance ideal for a nice dinner/date and the staff is very well educated in Japanese cuisine. BYOB is a big plus, while other sushi restaurants offer that too.  Now moving on to the experience and food, Coast Sushi came across a bit fancier to me, trying to go beyond the norm with their offerings and while there is nothing wrong in that, I was expecting simple, but great sushi, and while Coast Sushi delivered on that, I feel other places do it better.  All in all, you can't go wrong with this place. Try the spicy miso soup as an alternative to the usual miso soup - its got an interesting kick. Take your pick of the rolls, sushi/ngiri/sashimi - they were all good. I ordered the platter for variety and enjoyed most of it.

My friend lives around the corner, so we were trying our best to branch out and -- not to toot my own horn -- I think we did a pretty excellent job. Here's a rundown of what we had: Spicy Miso Soup - My friend's suggestion, I haaaaate miso. She got it, told me to try it -- for this miso, I make an exception. It's flavorful, spicy and almost creamy Agendashi Tofu (Salad) - Also delicious. Fried tofu on a bad of baby spinach, sitting on a slightly sweet dressing. There was a surreal moment when I was eating salad with chopsticks, but all the effort was worth it. Beef & Asparagus - Awesome. Small slices of beef wrapped around asparagus spears, chopped into 1-1/2 inch pieces, served with rice and teriyaki sauce. Yes!!! Spicy Scallop Roll - Decent, but forgettable. We foolishly (considering the $8 price tag), thought there would be hunks of scallop in this roll. Looks like the scallop was diced and blended with something mushy. It's fine, this place made us look pretty. Po' Boy - Amazing! Looks to be quite similar to the White Dragon which gets so many raves. A little crispness thanks to the tempura, a little creaminess thanks to the cream cheese. My friend who'd said she doesn't like cream cheese in her sushi was an immediate convert!

Just call ahead.   I usually opt for their specialty rolls... Last night I had the Spooky and Tuna on Top.  The Spooky roll isn't one I would normally choose (I usually pick anything that's spicy), but it just sounded so interesting.

Four starts because of the sushi chefs, and whoever makes the desserts! The rolls were beyond amazing.  Then there comes service... my girlfriend took me for my birthday. We had about a 25 minute wait, but then all of these other guests kept getting seated before us. I am pretty sure they ""don't"" take reservations, for parties under 4, and then if you have to cancel there is a $15 cancellation fee ( FYI) so I was confused on how these parties of two were getting seated before us.  We finally get seated and our waitress gets us new wine glasses ( fancy ones) We already knew we wanted two appetizers. But, she didn't even finish the specials...        The appetizers came out about  35 minutes later... Edamame doesn't take that long, and the other app shouldn't have either. Then 2 minutes later all four of our sushi rolls come out... The tables are so small, our waitress just kept putting stuff and reaching in my bubble.. Defintiely not a fan of service that day...

Unless they are operating on info from 10 years ago, I don't know why the vinegar would have gluten. Hoping to clarify a simple  misunderstanding, I asked to see the bottle of vinegar they use to check ingredients.  Flatly, the server instead just suggested I talk to a manager. I waited 10 minutes twiddling my thumbs,  hungry for sushi, but there was no manager to be found. On a Friday night at one of the best rated sushi restaurants in town,  no manager was available. The pretentious server showed no empathy or interest in helping me out,  and barely said sorry as I walked out the door. The gluten problem is the minor issue here: my biggest complaint is of the terribly rude and apathetic service.  Gluten allergic folks, skip Coast and head over to Hachi's Kitchen instead.  There you'll find great sushi, a warm and friendly environment, and prompt, attentive service.",-0.3884,0.732,0.123,0.145,0.5162337662337662

Cons: -on the phone, and on the menu, they say their BYOB policy is 1 bottle of wine allowed per couple. Well, both of the tables next to us went beyond the 1 bottle allotment, while we sat there wishing we could have brought a white for me and a red for him. Not a good policy.  -perhaps this is minor, but I also made sure to mention when I made the reservation that we were celebrating a birthday, and they said they would do something.

Dim lighting, candle-lit, smaller tables that allow more intimate interatctions. Good spot for a third date - too loud for first date, too dark for second. Anyways, their menu has a decent amount of selections. Prices are very reasonable. Jalapeno seems to be a stable on their menu, which I definitely have reservations about. * hamachi carpacio - yellow tail sashimi dressed with jalapeno, lime juice and cilantro. Too acidic. Overwhelmed the yellow tail. In fact, I did not know I was eating yellow tail.  * coast crab maki - very tasty. A little bit on the dry side. Nothing a white wine cannot alleviate though.   * natsu (not on menu) - supposed to be a very clean roll, so said our server. I believed it was yellow tail with jalapeno and mint. Again, fish got miserably overwhelmed and it was too acidic. The rice on this roll was also drenched in vinegar. * salmon sashimi - very good quality. Still not as good as Toro's * tuna sashimi - fishy which I expected. Do not recommend. * mochi - $5.5 for two pieces that looked and tasted like they were store bought. Not sure if I would go for these again. But again, cannot say no to green tea and red bean mochi on a summer night. Overall I liked my experience here. It's incredible that they are still BYOB.

Joel G. is right. There are some lovely ladies that hit this place up. However, most of them just dress nicely. It's amazing what men excuse when you show off your lady parts and a fake tan. The classier outfits went towards the women who were closer to their 40's. Some of these women came in with their significant others. These sharply-dressed women were clearly unhappy. Their men looked like they would rather be somewhere else. Not many of the couples were smiling. More emotionally-washed-out thirty to forty somethings, yay!! I saw no men here that were my type. Maybe Joel G. was right. These guys are classic Wrigleyville/Bucktown types who seem to travel in packs; managing conversation that goes no deeper than what woman they would like to sex it up with in the restaurant; or how their fantasy football teams are doing.

I like how it's dark and every table has a candle that sits inside a rock, casting the perfect golden glow across the table for you and your partner. I was a little miffed because my waitress made no effort to light ours. Every table had their candle going. Good thing I had  lighter in my purse! It would be very romantic if it wasn't so loud.

2013-08-14,4.0,"Coast has moved up on my list with the closure of several other big name sushi places over the past year and a half.  Coast delivers solid Nigri, Sashimi, and Maki which at some locations is not the case.  The fact that they have fresh fish, big crowds to turn over a lot of fish, and they are BYOB makes this a solid choice for sushi locations.  Additionally, their prices are pretty good.  Good people watching here as well.  Some good app choices come up on the board from time to time and they also get some specialty fish seasonally.  I return to this one about 5+ times a year. I tend to hit this place with some buddies that are single as they are big fans of this place due to the amount of women that dine here in large packs.  My typical night here consists of meeting my single buddies, bringing a pile of great beer, ribbing the one guy that brings wine (even though we all enjoy wine), and then laughing at these guys either hitting on the ladies or talking about hitting on the ladies in-between complaints about the Sox, Cubs, or whatever Chicago sports team is not doing well at the time.  Some chit chat about what fantasy player should be picked up in between rolls.  Poorly indicating we should check out some table of ladies while we wolf down $75 each worth of fish.  Thankful it's BYOB or we would be talking about a hefty bill if we actually had to pay for our booze.  Being the married guy among the singles makes for an entertaining evening for me. Dinner hear and then I suggest hitting the Map Room for a fantastic beer selection as it's right down the street.   Parking in the area is a total pain in the ass so be prepared",0.9855,0.829,0.138,0.033,0.3899129544290835
2013-08-13,3.0,"We went here for my birthday dinner, just a small group of 6, and made a reservation well in advance. Unfortunately that didn't seem to mean much as we still had to wait almost an hour past our reservation time to be seated. Once we were seated and got our food we were ok, it was all very good but expensive for the portions we were given. The fresh toro sashimi appetizer was 4 pieces of paper thin tuna and $25! I don't mind paying if I am getting something substantial but we all left hungry after a couple rolls and an appetizer each. The rolls we had were very good, just smaller than we usually get from other sushi places. So while the food was good, the long wait and small portions will probably keep me from returning. There are plenty of other sushi places in the area that are cheaper and easier to get into that still have high quality fish.",0.9651,0.857,0.133,0.01,0.504375
2013-08-03,4.0,"It's been awhile since I've had fresh sushi, and after one bite here, I remembered what it was all about. Pure goodness. My tongue salivated as I chewed and swallowed. The fish went down easy. Oh the nostalgia of good sushi! We ordered spicy miso, tuna tartare, eel with avocado roll and the dragon roll (shrimp tempura, cream cheese, spicy mayo, unagi, avocado, masago, eel sauce). Spicy Miso - PERFECT. Not too salty, and definitely not bland! They add some jalapenos in there so it may be a tad spicy for some. They don't give you spoons because apparently in Japan, they drink it straight from the bowl (they'll ask if you would like spoons, though). Tuna Tartare - Not my favorite, but not to say it was bad. Tuna was definitely fresh. No comments other than that. Eel with avocado - My favorite. Simple and effective. It's literally what the name says...eel with avocado (in a roll with rice, of course). I love unagi (eel) on my sushi. The eel was fresh (I think you're getting the point now...) and the eel sauce worked well as always. The rice to fish ratio was excellent. There wasn't too much rice to overpower the flavor of the eel and the sweet eel sauce.  Dragon roll - It was great, but I'm not too big of a fan of cream cheese or any other type of cheeses on my sushi. It was an order for the table and I had a couple pieces. Spicy mayo worked well with the eel sauce. I like, but again, not my favorite.  We called in for a reservation (table of 5) the day before. It wasn't crowded or anything when we got there, but there wasn't a wait with our reservation. All the tables were full  by the time we left (Saturday, ~8pm).

Thankfully they left after twenty minutes or so.

From the moment we walked in we knew it would be an odd experience, and I wish we'd listened to our gut - we should have turned around and walked out after the hostess tried to seat us at a table where others had not yet vacated (""oops sorry, they haven't left yet"") but it only got worse from there. The douche vibe was off the charts. Fine, I can handle a little douche. But being surrounded by nothing but douches in my new neighborhood sushi spot was kind of getting me down. A few minutes after sitting down I needed to use the restroom - all those negronis at the Charleston, you know. So I head to the bathroom and the girl in front of me says the toilet is overflowing. Let me ask you a question, have you ever heard that saying ""a restaurant is only as clean and well maintained as its bathroom..."" ?!?! So the toilet in the female restroom is clogged, we already ordered our sushi and can't get out of this experience on account of the fact that I don't really trust their hygiene anymore, and whatever..... it is what it is, right? So us females capitalize on the mens bathroom (they were not pleased), since there is no other option, and I start wondering about the freshness of this fish, and that's about when I wish we had gone to our favorite sushi spot instead of this new neighborhood crapshoot. Back at the table, they offer no bottle opener for the beer, have no glasses for the beer (something about them all being dirty and lets wait a while and see if any clean ones come available?!?!), and at this point we realize we are surrounded by first dates. First dates who are all emphatically stating this is the hippest BYOB sushi spot in town and yadayadayada, and what the hell are we doing here in this douchey sushi hell hole?! Sushi arrives, yea its fine, nothing special, nothing too terrible, nothing too fresh tasting, a bit gluey tasting in the rice department. You can tell they fry the shrimp for the rolls hours in advance, thus rendering the roll limp and cold, sad and oily. The raw seafood is fine but fresh isn't the first word that comes to mind. We arrived at the start of this experience intending to linger over our drinks, as we would normally do at our favorite spot, but instead decide to bounce after a beer each and cut our losses. We pay the tab (at this point yet another first date  match.com  couple has been seated next to us) and we leave, asking ourselves what the hell just happened. The moral of this story is when you find a sushi spot you trust (fresh! friendly! they know us now!) and adore, never stray far off from what you know. The reward never outweighs the risk.

Our server was not particularly friendly and when I wanted to order the uni shooters, they were out of uni and she didn't make any recommendations for anything else since they were out. The ""crunchy tempura"" roll was not tempura..it was more like long john silver's fried shrimp rolled into a gigantic piece of rice.

Mood lighting and dark wood décor set a romantic ambiance. The sushi we ordered was just eh. Ingredients were fresh (obvi very important) but overall there was too much rice and it was not slightly warm/vinegared. The rolls reminded me of high quality grocery store sushi.  Toro Appetizer was tasty - sashimi on top of a thin sliced cucumber topped with sprouts sitting on a little bit of daikon strings soaked in spicy ponzu sauce. With less spicy ponzu sauce this dish would have been perfection because it overpowered the entire dish which is unfortunate. Hamachi Nigiri ($3 per piece) was fresh/sweet/nicely sliced and had a great rice to fish ratio. SUNRISE (R) $12.00 ginger seared tuna, mint, wrapped with mango - mint was a nice touch and if there was a spear of mango actually inside the roll it would have sealed the deal. MAINE (R) $15.00 cooked lobster in ginger mayo with scallion, salmon roe and cucumber on top - not worth it both in flavor, amount of lobster, and price.   CRUNCHY (R) $8.00 spicy tuna, avocado, cucumber, tempura - standard and was good  BYOB btw. Maybe we ordered the wrong things.

Food: we started with the soft shell crab, uni shooters, and tuna tartare.  I love uni but I wasn't a fan of the shooters: too much stuff going on (too much vinegar) that didn't really make the uni better (quail egg?  It's so creamy but that makes the uni seem less so).  The soft shell crab was quite tasty; comes with two so it's a little hard to split, and the tuna tartare is fresh and yummy.  The wakame (seaweed salad) is also quite tasty and a good way to start your meal.   Then we split a ton of rolls.  We definitely got the White Dragon Roll because of yelp and it was a fun choice: crunchy, with a tiny bit of spicy with a wasabi mayo-y sauce on top, and that sweet/salty shrimp tempura inside.  Also loved the Sunset roll, which was tuna, mint, and wrapped in mango: simple and lovely.  Wish we'd gotten more nigiri: the hamachi was succulent and fresh.  Then there was the octopus, spicy tuna, ceviche, nightly special (jalapeno, salmon, superwhite tuna), and maybe a few more. Finished off our feast with mochi!  They have the most flavors of ice cream mochi I've seen anywhere.  One order comes with two, each beautiful little ice cream/rice ball split in half so for easy sharing.  We had the passionfruit, sakura, chocolate mint, and tiramisu: loved them except for the chocolate mint.  I feel like chocolate and mochi don't go well together.

Upon arriving we were greeted and seated within a few minutes, but when we realize that the host was going to seat us at a 4 top, when we had 5 people, she said oh well you guys made reservation for 4 and we told her it was an honest mistake and it will be 5, so we go back up front while she handles this matter of finding a 5 top for us. A few minutes later she goes and seats us a few tables down from our original table and told us, ""Since you guys are a large party now, we will need our table back by 8."" *AGHAST* *SHOCK* *SMH* *SERIOUSLY*  Can't believe she said that to us, left an extremely sour taste in my mouth. Luckily for us our server was fantastic and everything he recommended we ordered. Starters: Seafood Ceviche: ( yelp.com/biz_photos/coas… ) - this was bland to me and the cracker thing does nothing for this dish. Maybe I got the top part of the ceviche and it lacked flavor since my gfs said the bottom has more lime to it, but isn't ceviche suppose to be all around well coated? Tataki Special: ( yelp.com/biz_photos/coas… ) this had a very good flavor, possibly from the oil, but $21? Ehhh Salmon Spring Roll: ( yelp.com/biz_photos/coas… ) to me spring roll is NOT fried, this should be called salmon eggroll, the portion is skimpy, but the curry sauce is a great pair to this Tuna Tartar: ( yelp.com/biz_photos/coas… ) more blandness, salt and pepper please Entrees/Makis: yelp.com/biz_photos/coas… yelp.com/biz_photos/coas… yelp.com/biz_photos/coas… Overall, nothing stood out to me or worth raving about. The Po Boy Maki wasn't all that interesting as it sounded every though the portion might be huge it was mainly avocado.  Desserts: Mochi (mango, red bean, green tea, and passion fruit): ( yelp.com/biz_photos/coas…  and  yelp.com/biz_photos/coas…  ) how can you go wrong with mochi? Yum! Flourless cake: ( yelp.com/biz_photos/coas… ) although it might look heavy this dessert was a perfect heading to a high carb meal. Extremely light and quite delicious. Our food was decent and our service was great, nothing was amazing though. Oh, and Imagine that we finished and left exactly at 8! Yeah, you can have your table back Coast Sushi, but as for me? I probably won't be returning.",0.9964,0.776,0.184,0.041,0.5470781893004114
2013-04-06,3.0,"I don't agree with the four star review that coast has. It's definitely just A-ok for many reasons. I do enjoy it's close location to me, but for better sushi I'd be willing to go to others places further away. Now don't get me wrong, the sushi was good, but not out of this world. We had the Po' Boy ($15 bucks, 8+ pieces) and the White Dragon ($13 bucks). Being the most expensive rolls on the maki menu I was surprised how meh they were. In fact, the Po' Boy could of been prepared better as it fell completely apart upon snatching it up with my chop sticks and left me fishing for tasty morsels in my soy sauce. We did order 3 other rolls but I can't even begin to remember what they were.  We were a party of four that ordered 5 rolls, edamame, and someone got a hot green tea. With the no corkage fee our bill was very reasonable at $65 bucks.  I do have to say that this was the first restaurant that I've showed up to at our reserved time and was immediately taken to our table when there were at least 15 people sitting and waiting for a table. I thought that was pretty cool to see the ""reservation"" was actually treated as such. We appreciated this very much! As for the service, it was mediocre. Our waitress was nice but had more of a ""meh"" attitude. May be she was has an off night.",0.9802,0.793,0.152,0.055,0.5299444444444444

Let me start out by saying that the service is abominable.....the worst waitress I have ever had. She was rude, socially awkward, and left us waiting for our food forever.  They are lucky I was not a secret diner because they would have been shut down the very next day.  She never even checked on us.....just awful. The food.....AWFUL.  We saw our food sitting there while the waitress neglected to bring it to us.  this place has gone way way down. And the management is aloof and upholds horrible customer service.  Even after speaking with the manager about our awful experience no one still seemed to care or check on us....shame on you Coast. Do yourself a favor and go to a quality sushi restaurant such as Kamehachi or Akai Hana where you will be treated with respect and where they uphold high standards of customer service and where the food is edible. I would have given Coast zero stars if I could have. Overpriced with an attitude.....I hope this restaurant goes out of business ...and fast.",-0.7159,0.786,0.097,0.117,0.6711111111111111

Devin discussed several items they were featuring that were not on the menu. We decided to go with his suggestion of spicy crab cake stick and the seaweed salad, which I love. The spicy crab cake stick appetizer was tasty, but $17 for an appetizer, really? We also ordered the volcano, tuna on top, coast crab and two pieces of unagi. The unagi was delicious the other three rolls all tasted very similar and I wasn't incredibly overwhelmed by any of the three. There was a large table of ladies sitting next to us that were thoroughly enjoying themselves, so much so that they broke two wine glasses during their meal.

Of all the sushi restaurants I've tried in Chicago, the fish here was the freshest and extremely tasty.  I did make the mistake of ordering too many specialty rolls which while interesting, were not as memorable as the nigiri and plain maki where you can taste and appreciate the excellent flavor of the fish.  With that said, if you're ordering a signature maki roll the white dragon is a must try.  I don't recommend the volcano roll though.  It was kinda mushy and covered in too much tempura crumb.  California roll, fresh salmon, and the spicy miso soup were the standouts for me.  Totally going for the sashimi here next time. Warning, this place is popular so make reservations in advance.  Take the train if you can because otherwise you'll end up circling the block looking for parking.",0.945,0.822,0.125,0.053,0.5212525879917184

Everything also looks really delicious even before you eat it. Their nigiri pieces are also perfectly put together and always taste fresh.  Coast can get busy on the weekend nights, but that is generally to be expected. They are BYO even though I normally don't take advantage of that.

We went in on 1/1/13 for a friend's birthday celebration. We were a party of 10. First off, we were seated by the windows & door. It was wicked cold as are Chicago winters. The birthday girl came in half frozen & asked for hot tea. They'd run out of tea....really? The area in which we were seated was only a couple of degrees warmer than it was outside. The bday girl AND her husband, on separate occasions asked if we could move to the other room but were told no. I didn't want to appear wimpy & was pulling my coat onto my leg but when my boyfriend actually put on his coat & gloves, I too, put on my coat. The gentleman next to me apologetically put on his sweater & mumbled something about layers as his wife had her scarf wrapped around her neck. I later found out that the bday girl also had her coat over her legs. I've read up on the reviews of this establishment & have noticed that service is not always the best quality. Well, par for the course.  Once our entire party was seated, our server asked if anyone was there for the first time. I raised my hand & said, 'Me!' She looked me in the eye & went onto a different subject. I'm still wondering if she was just taking a poll without an end result. Our server took our order & I ordered 2 rolls. I guess it's the fashion to haphazardly place whatever rolls & pieces on which ever plate. One of my rolls ended up by me with someone else's roll on the same plate & my other roll ended up on the other end of the table. I had to pass my plate down to I could get my other roll. I knew that wasabi was available since I had some with appetizers. Of course there wasn't any on my end of the table so once again, my plate took a journey to the other end of the table for a chunk of the green stuff. I then thought it strange that pickled ginger wasn't being served (the plate with my ebi & the other roll looked quite desolate without wasabi & ginger). I noticed ginger on someone's plate & when I asked, they said, 'Yeah! We've got some! Pass your plate down!!' so for the third time, my plate was hiked over to the other end of the table.  When my bf went to the restroom, he noticed that there was definitely room for our party in the other room so why my friends were told that we couldn't move is a mystery to me. I ended up texting the bday girl apologizing that were going to eat & run It was truly that cold. I let her know that we'd be going for sushi & a much warmer & longer experience in the near future. She apologized to me which of course I let her know wasn't her fault.  I give this establishment one star because the sushi was decent. I can't see any reason to return to this place.

2012-11-27,3.0,"*********************** 798 *************************           A busy sushi restaurant in Buck Town, down the street from my best friend's place. We walked here for a quick dinner. She told me they have a good vibe, rolls, and the best thing is bring your own bottle BYOB at no charge. Perfect.         Coast Sushi Bar is hip, dark like a lounge rather than a sushi joint, loud music, was packed on a week night. Hostess greeted us right away, sent us to a tiny table in the back of the second dining room, which got no lighting. So we requested to sit at the sushi bar instead.         Being spoiled with sushi selection in Northern California, I don't expect much for a neighborhood sushi joint like Coast Sushi Bar.  My best friends and I ordered a bit of everything. - MISO soup with tofu and scallion - $2 - SEAWEED SALAD - seaweed and cucumber in sesame vinaigrette - generous portion for $5 - WARM SHRIMP SALAD - shrimp tossed with wasabi garlic dressing on mesclun, sweet corn tempura - only $8.50, my best friend loved it. She said she orders it each time she's here.  - Shiitake mushroom, spinach, egg, served with rice - a cool appetizer dish.  - Uni shooter - the uni is not fresh at all, I guess that's why they serve in a shooter style! - VOLCANO MAKI roll - albacore in hot volcano sauce with tempura crumb - my best friend likes it. I didn't, the rice was fallen apart, wasn't tighten enough. $13 - SPICY SALMON MAKI - fresh salmon, spicy mayo, scallion, tempura crumb, tobiko - generous for $13 - Hamachi, Hirame, shiso maguro nigiri $2.5-$3 each piece. They were all dried look, much thinner cut than I used to in Nor Cal, and wasn't fresh :-(       I tried other other fishes, but they didn't have anything else, limited nigiri selections. The bar was loud because the sushi cooks kept yelling at each others for orders in Thai. The restaurant owned by Thai obviously. Although the cooks were nice to us when I asked questions and etc.      I guess for being in the Midwest, Coast Sushi Bar offers good vibe, CHEAP eat, quick service, and if you like rolls, you should come here. However if you are an authentic sushi lover, this is not a place for you.       P.S. Our waitress was very nice and attentive to us.",0.9932,0.809,0.158,0.033,0.5367604617604618

2012-09-05,5.0,"I've been to more than 40 sushi restaurants in Chicago and Coast is the one restaurant that all others get compared to.  They offer the convenience and affordability of a BYOB (no corkage fee) while offering the fresh quality of the more upscale and expensive sushi restaurants in town.  Aside from Sunda and Roka Akor, I have not found a restaurant in Chicago that has better fish quality than Coast.  And unlike Sunda and Roka Akor, Coast is the type of place you can go when you're tired after a long day and don't feel like cooking, but don't feel like getting dressed up or spending a lot of money.  The service is always excellent, the food is always impeccable, and the atmosphere is always lively but intimate.  They never have an off night.  And now that they accept reservations, Coast is officially the total package.  Definitely make reservations before going though - this place is popular and always packed.  Sometimes I think Sublime Sushi (just 75 feet away) opened their business just so they could capitalize on people who try to go to Coast but are too impatient to wait for a table.   You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  For those of you who like spice, be sure to ask for a side of their chili sauce.  It's similar to the typical Sirracha sauce that you get at most restaurants, but Coast makes their own version of it that adds a nice little change. I've had both rolls and nigiri at Coast, and everything from the tuna to hamachi to hirame has always been fresh and tasty.  The rolls are always made tightly with a great ratio of inner ingredients to outer ingredients.  Unlike too many sushi restaurants, they focus on the flavors inside, rather than just pile on a too-thick layer of rice to make the roll look bigger. Coast is my go-to for sushi in Chicago.  That doesn't mean I'm not always trying new places, but I typically leave them all wondering why I didn't just go to Coast instead.  It really is the gem of Bucktown and worth the trip if you don't live near the neighborhood.",0.9878,0.853,0.114,0.033,0.5814809804393138

The maki rolls were better.  Everyone ordered a roll to themselves and had a few more to share.  The White Dragon roll was very good, unique.  I also ordered a Philadelphia, but I've had better.   The atmosphere was loud and a bit crowded.  The decor is along the normal lines for a trendy sushi place.   Throughout the night, we had a few communications of when our table needed to ""vacate.""  When the reservation was made, it was 9pm.  When they sat us down, they said it was 9:15pm.  However, at exactly 9:00pm, we were asked to leave.  It isn't like we had food still on the table or that our bill hadn't been paid, but a little please and thank you would have made the transition go more smoothly..

In my opinion I absolutely love it and am a huge fan. I have been to many sushi restaurants in not just Chicago but many other states and so far i have found that Coast as  my favorite. Everyone does have there own opinion about Coast but in my opinion I absolutely loved it.  Everyone knows that if a sushi restaurant is warm and gross looking it most likely will get you sick. Not in Coasts case, yes the restaurant is freezing but that is the best thing for the sushi which means its fresh. As many times as i have been there the sushi has not yet disappointed me yet and they do always present the sushi very elegant and nice.  Another thing I noticed about going to Coast is that it is really a good idea to get there around 7 or 8 because by then it does get very crowded, so if you are planning on having a nice dinner or even a nice romantic date you will not be disturbed by many people the con about Coast is it is very Crowded and kind of tight spaced but that doesn't mean you always need to go with a big Group.   One of my favorite rolls would have to be the Rainbow Roll because I absolutely love all the fish on top and the roll all together.

2012-08-12,3.0,"Honestly? Overrated. Many many people RAVED about Coast so I'd been DYING to try it. Maybe it was a case of High Expectations Syndrome---you know when everyone and their grandmothers exclaim ""OMGAH I found the BEST sushi place, you're just going to LOVE IT!!!!"" Then you wait and wait and dream and dream about the lucky day you can pick that piece of heaven up. Time will stand still and it's just you and that maki in the room...you pick up your chopsticks, take a bite, and all of a sudden all seems right in the world. Well, like any normal person that is how I imagined it. And....was pretty underwhelmed. I had the Philly and the Una Q (unagi, cucumber, eel sauce). Both were just ok. I judge my sushi by freshness (of fish, rice, and veggies) and flavor of sauces. Everything was middle ground (nothing was spoiling by any means, but I've definitely had fresher ingredients). The eel sauce was also nothing standout. Somewhat bland and watered down.  One huge pro was the AMBIANCE and DECOR. I absolutely LOVE the dark orange walls with cherry blossoms. =D The very dim lighting, candles, and fairly quiet noise level make it a perfect date spot. Very comfortable, classy booth seats as well.  So all in all, GOLD STAR for ambiance and service (our waitress was very friendly and gave us several recommendations). Bronze star or 4th place for the sushi itself. I still prefer SEADOG or even Ukai over Coast. As a few stated, I wouldn't go out of my way to go here again.

BYOB Sushi spots should understand that large groups of loud, picky-eating, females looking to get crunked on a budget aka Bachelorette parties are their best customers.Coast was a bit unfriendly to our group of seven and we were actually asked to vacate the table at exactly 9pm. Don't bother asking politely for silverware unless you want to be made to feel like an uncultured simpleton. I'm also not a fan of the one bottle per two people policy (there needs to be a policy?) However, the staff did accommodate my friend's request to make her rolls mild, and they seemed to know the menu very well.  The rolls were all great, but the appetizers didn't meet my expectations. The appetizers all seemed to lack the pizazz that the menu described. The Gyoza and Shumai were pretty standard. The asparagus beef was rather bland and nearly impossible to manage as a shared plate (maneuvering rice, sauce, and beef wrapped asparagus with chopsticks was tough). The Tropical ceviche needed some zing. The maki rolls were much better than the appetizers. I really enjoyed my Spicy Crunchy Tuna and there wasn't too much spicy mayo. The White dragon roll was very flavorful and my favorite of the night. The Sweet potato tempura roll was also a highlight. The Tuna on Top had a lot going on, but at $15 the roll wasn't that special. I didn't try the Summer special roll, but others seemed to enjoy it.  Coast does have a very nice decor and would be good for a date.

We called on Thursday for a res and they were already booked, so we had to go the Patrick Bateman-unapproved route with no reservation.

Plus Map Room is 2 blocks away, so we didn't have much of a problem with this at all.  Service was prompt and attentive. All of the rolls were fresh and interestingly presented - the crunchy spicy tuna with avocado was my personal favorite, served with all the pieces stacked into a pyramid doused in panko. Very unique. The regular spicy tuna was also good, and even the kappa (cucumber and avocado), ordinarily mediocre, was delicious.

I've waited about a month to write about our meal so I can't recall each maki roll we ordered but it doesn't matter. The food is very good and the atmosphere is lively and fun due in no small part to the BYOB policy. It's classier and trendier than your neighborhood BYO which means it's slightly harder to get into but the food is clearly better. I really think it's one of the better all around BYO sushi places I've been to in a while - especially in the area. It may not ""wow"" you with everything on the table and you know the servers are desperately trying to turn tables - but a few rolls stood out for excellent flavors. And finally, the value is better than average for good service and a fun experience in a good setting. We started with my favorite - an order of gomae - and it came in a funny presentation of three small separate pieces instead of a large one. that didn't matter because it was tasty with a nice sesame sauce. We also tried two of the specials: one sashimi and another salmon type roll with something in the middle. I really liked the sashimi with a hot pepper and a little kick. Refreshing and simple. As the first picture demonstrates,we ordered a lot of food for the four of us. We ate it all fast enough to order a couple extra too. Everything was great and I don't quite remember which rolls were my favorite. We used spicy rolls when possible and enjoyed the liberal use of tempura flakes or crunchy this and that. The menu is plenty large to keep you satisfied and interested for many visits. There's a good reason Coast remains one of the more popular sushi restaurants in town, especially one that combines high quality and a BYO policy.

Awesome place, Coast.  All food was fantastic and the sushi extremely fresh.  The rolls have a rather playful quality to them...working with contrasts:  crunchy-chewy, crisp-slippery, cool-warm, spicy-sweet.  Flavors are bright, balanced & perfectly controlled.   The service was spot on.  The ambiance is appropriate for a Bucktown sushi house (read sushi house decor with tragically hip, tragically monied clientelle).   We wound up there when a friend requested we take her for her birthday as she was craving the white dragon roll.  Now I understand why.  It's a must.  Also be sure to request the now-off-the-menu popper roll.  And if you're Family, pair it with the rainbow roll along side.  (No snickers from those of Rainbow Nation.  Oh, ok, go ahead.  Snicker.  The husband and I did.  Our straight female company were clueless.)  Not only are they visually stunning together, but they taste amazing.  Wow...did that sound gay.  Oh well, you get my meaning.  The standbys such as spicy crunchy tuna hold up as well.  Suffice to say, we made pigs of ourselves.  Move over Rise!",0.9727,0.808,0.162,0.03,0.644949494949495

I think the redeeming part is that the 9 rolls they do make are really good and the ingredients were fresh and high quality both times I went. If less variety in speciality rolls doesn't bother you or if you are more of a classic maki or sashimi kind of sushi eater, this place is good. The bottom line is I think the BYOB nature of this & the atmosphere are good but to me they eclipse the sushi itself.  It's good for a 1st or 2nd date when atmosphere generally outweighs culinary exploration, but if it's more about the sushi eating experience and less about atmosphere, I'd probably go elsewhere.",0.9927,0.801,0.199,0.0,0.5093478260869565

2011-07-04,1.0,"I write this review as a celiac and a celiac only. NEVER eat here if you have celiac disease. The food is not safe. They claim to provide gluten-free food. They even have a cute little menu that says ""Gluten Allergy"" on the front marked up so you know what you can supposedly order and eat safely. I repeat -  THE FOOD IS NOT SAFE.  We had a lovely waiter, named James, who was clearly well educated on gluten and who helped me navigate the menu and the specials. He even brought wheat- free tamari out of the back for me. After I had ingested a few maki rolls, my partner who had heard me voice concerns earlier about sushi rice having gluten in it, asked James if there was gluten in the vinegar they used to make the rice. He was quick to admit he wasn't sure and went to go double check. Shortly thereafter, James returned and said ""Actually, I was mistaken. The rice is a problem. There is gluten in the vinegar. Nothing here is apparently safe for you."" So, we cancelled the rest of the meal and told him we were finished. He apologized profusely. And even returned a few times to tell us that he felt terrible and that he wouldn't have ever done anything to hurt me, he thought he could trust the ""Gluten Allergy"" menu and advice from the managers. James' service was excellent.  The manager came over and I explained to her the detriment of handing people a menu with ""Gluten Allergy"" written on it with claims that they actually have safe dishes that we can eat when they don't. I also explained that I will get really sick from the food. She said that if I wanted to go to the doctor they would cover it. A nice gesture, I guess? She didn't understand, as most people don't... its not as if I can go to the hospital and get a shot... or some drugs... I just get sick. And eventually, the more that this happens, the more chance I have of developing ... you know... fun stuff like stomach cancer. Anyway, I tried to explain this to her. I told her that wasn't how it worked. She left.  Then the bill arrived. Yeah, that's right, they asked us to pay for our meal (which was only $40). We explained that since they had basically poisoned me, we didn't feel it fair to pay for the check. She stalled us, tried to call the other managers, she said she needed me to fill out some form, and that ...yes, we should pay for our bill. My husband, best friend and I got a bit heated... asked if she was sure she felt like we should pay... if she was really certain that this was what she wanted. She said yes - and so I agreed to pay - and then, THEN she wouldn't take my credit card. She used it as bait to get me to wait while she called the other managers...presumably to bring me some ""form""...said she needed us to wait a bit longer, as if the 20 minutes of waiting and the 10 minutes of arguing wasn't enough. I told her we had to leave and to quit calling the other managers... just to let me pay and leave... and she. wouldn't. do. it. She kept telling us to wait. No f-ing joke.  So, we just left.

Everyone says the White Dragon is the best, etc etc..but I think there was too much eel sauce to actually enjoy the roll. Out of all the rolls I had..i would recommend getting the roll on Specials ..specifically for the Japanese Relief.  I never had shiitake in my roll before, and it was actually pretty good~ The Spicy Crunchy TUna & Rainbow roll...were just alright.  Once again..these rolls would be great compared to other good sushi restaurants if they just had the sushi rice down.  If you smother your sushi in soy sauce, then I don't think it would be a problem. Our bill came out to be a little over 60 bucks with tip, and we left still hungry.   I wouldn't mind coming back if I happened to be in the area, but it definitely did not make my favorites list.",0.9449,0.86,0.109,0.031,0.40962669018224573
2011-04-02,4.0,Busy place on a weeknight so I would recommend making reservations. I mean it was packed on a Wednesday night and that should tell you something about a place. Overall the food was great and the prices matched. Our server was non-obtrusive and very knowledgeable on the cuisine. Although the one thing that peeved me was the specials blurb that seemed to last about 5 minutes and then I didn't really remember anything he had said. I think having them printed out would be nice but then again I don't run a restaurant.  We started out with sesame crusted scallops and the wasabi shumai for appetizers. Looking back I would have went with the scallop teriyaki instead because the sesame seeds were kind of a distraction. They were just gritty in the mouth and provided no flavor (and then worry about black seeds stuck in your teeth). So of course we got the White Dragon and Po' Boy maki. That was pretty much decided before we got there. As my lady friend has been here several times. I would certainly recommend ending the meal with mochi. A cheap bottle of wine and a 60 dollar tab made for a nice evening out with some superior sushi.,0.9056,0.786,0.135,0.08,0.48794642857142867

2011-03-30,1.0,"AWFUL!!! This was hands down one of the WORST sushi experiences I have ever had..  So disappointing because the place came highly reccommended. I wouldn't go there again if someone paid me. I'd like to preface this with this: I've been a server for 10 yrs and it takes a LOT for me to complain.  I'm very understanding and very forgiving, but I was so disappointed with this experience. We arrived for a late dinner on Monday around 10-1030, so they were not busy at all.  Yet, my friend and I waited over ten minutes for someone to greet us. Our server seemed distracted and unconcerned with our table. I understand byob, but never once refilled our glasses. We ordered a Sunrise & Wasabi roll as well as several pieces of sashimi. Our server brought us a plate with a piece of shrimp and a small roll.  Took him quite a bit of time to notice and seemed very unapologetic. When we did get the Sunrise roll, the tuna was disgusting.  I've tasted better out of the can.  Too bad our server never came to check on us and inquire as to why we weren't eating it.  The salmon was great (the best part of the evening).  The rest of the sushi was ok, not very impressed.  At last call for food, we ordered another 2 rolls, the crunchy spicy tuna and a spicy tako...and he brought us the wrong one...again.  Did not once apologize or seem at all worried that he messed up...again.  By this time it was around 11:15.  I had read that they are open until midnight.  Yes, we were the last table, but we had spent a lot of money on subpar food.  Two minutes after dropping off the correct roll, our server became super attentive...he came by to ask if we were finished with the roll that we had eaten one piece of. We never did finish that roll because it too was lacking freshness.  The octopus was sliced so thickly it was like eating rubber. Overall, the food would have been easier to swallow had the service been decent.  But both were lacking and it was incredibly embarrassing because we were celebrating my friend's 30th birthday and our friend had flown in from Austin, TX to be here.  I will never return to this restaurant and hope this particular server gets reprimanded. I've worked in several restaurants that these Yelp! reviews are taken very seriously and I hope this one is.

Food: The sashimi at Coast is excellent, always serving up the freshest fish.  The hamachi (yellowtail) carpaccio appetizer is out of this world delicious, along with the fatty salmon sashimi and the lobster sashimi. The maki rolls are very inventive, however I have found that when the roll contains tempura fried pieces, it often times comes out cold.  This is a bit of a turn off, as the temperature of these rolls makes a huge difference in the flavor.  Nonetheless, the white dragon roll is still my favorite. Atmos: Extremely dark, the atmosphere inside of the restaurant has a swanky, romantic feel.  Guaranteed wait on the weekends and often times during the late week.  Bring a bottle of your favorite wine and they will open it for you to drink as you wait.  There is a liquor store less than a block away at Armitage and Damen that has a decent wine selection.

2011-03-05,5.0,"Best sushi in Bucktown no contest. They have a great menu, and I prefer BYOB, as it's so much cheaper to buy a bottle at Binny's than to buy by the glass at a restaurant. I definitely recommend the potstickers as an app, but make sure you always ask fir the specials. I have had pretty great crab cake app before, but you have to catch it at the right time. Many of the sushi rolls come with roe, so if you're not a fan of fish eggs make sure you order without, no problem. No dirty looks like you might get elsewhere. If you're not in the mood for sushi, they have some great fish entrees, and once again keep an eye out for their specials.  When it's time for dessert, try the mochi. It might sound weird, and it might even look weird, but it's delicious. I have tried all the varieties, and while I'm partial to tiramisu, they are all delicious.  They keep half the restaurant open for walkins and take reservations for the other half. I live close, so i swing by and put my name in and give them my number, and they call when your table is ready. Much better than waiting in their waiting area, which is a little cramped.

Needless to say, byob at a sushi restaurant is a great way to save $$.  The food, once we sat down, was perfect-- best thing ever was that they had gluten free soy sauce. For anyone needing that, this is the place to go...maybe call ahead to make sure they have some in stock (they were running low last night, and I think I finished it up :), but what really got me was how knowledgeable and accommodating they were with finding the right sauce and warning me about other rolls on the table that I shouldn't eat...everyone I talked to there was great, and I had full confidence in anything they suggested (and felt good afterwards :) I ordered the Chirashi, which was amazingly fresh and good. I didn't try anything else, but the rolls on the table looked just as great.  The only reason it got a star knocked off the rating was because it was pretty dark in the restaurant, and so noisy that it was hard to hear across the table.

The second time, LOVED it. And then it all went downhill from there. From rude people taking reservations, to rude servers, I've seen it all. Honestly, I think it's only proximity that keeps us coming back. Our last stint at Coast involved a chilly 45 minute wait (we were given an estimate of 15 mins) in the front by the desk. Upon being seated between two aisles (really? really?! It was like a scene from a bad rom com), we order. FIrst, Mr. Server, please don't act like I've never eaten sushi before. When you ask me ""have you been here before?"" and I say ""Yes"" that means... I HAVE EATEN SUSHI BEFORE AND I KNOW HOW YOUR MENU WORKS. Tried the salmon tartare, pretty tasteless and not worth the money. I will say, the quality of the sushi is about the same, good not great. So that was ok.  This is the kicker. We were on the fence about dessert, and were going to ask to see the menu again. This is not unusual, right? Instead of asking if we were ""ok"" if we needed anything else... Mr. Server brings the CHECK. We politely ask for the dessert menu, and this dude looks like he's going to murder us. Awesome impression.  And, Coast, your dessert menu leaves much to be desired. We opt to NOT have dessert, and Mr. Server brings the check again, exasperated. Mea culpa. We still have a few sips of wine left, so instead of laying down a card right away, we chat some more. I want to note, we were NOT lingering, I think this bro can wait for two people to finish ONE half glass of wine a piece.  But no. He comes back 3 minutes later asking us to ""maybe wrap things up because we're really busy tonight"". Um... WHAT! Really, I wanted to lose it on this guy, but I didn't. I was annoyed because the table behind is (a table of 6 women, looked like a birthday) had been in the middle of their entree when we sat down, and had just popped open a new bottle of wine. How come THEY are allowed to linger, but you rush to turn over the worse table in the joint? Was there a demand to have your coat stepped on?

As for the sushi, it should be said that one of the stars I'm awarding is for the White Dragon roll alone.  I'd order it for carryout again if I had any inclination to give this place any more of my money.  Which I don't at this point.  Outside of that, the other three maki we had were inoffensive, and passable, but certainly not exceptional.  Maki done well should have a variety of textures and flavors, and most of ours were one note, sometimes even a little mushy.  We also sampled a special appetizer (the name of which escapes me now:  it was a piece of fish wrapped in fish with a little fritter) which was outright unpleasant, with a strong briny bite and that fish ""stink"" you associate with old or cheap cuts of fish.  Considering we paid, $11 for two bites, it was the biggest disappointment of the night.

For starter, the place is so dark that you can't even see what you are putting in your mouth. But that's not a capital offense. The food is the real culinary crime being committed against humanity here. The server has the audacity to tell us the fish is imported from Japan when we asked about where they buy their fish. If you have any standards in sushi at all, you wouldn't put the frozen, low-grade fish in your mouth.   I should point out that this is not an authentic Japanese place. One of the simplest tests you can use is to taste a Japanese restaurant's tempura. If the breading is not the light, authentic Japanese tempura breading, like this place, this should be a good sign that this place has no idea what real Japanese cooking is like. This places uses ""fried jalapeno"" type of breading...too thick and over-powering on the taste buds.

2011-02-06,4.0,This was my first time coming to Coast and I was really excited to try it! I am not a big sushi fanatic but I definitely enjoy the specialty rolls. My friend and I didn't bring any wine but we definitely would for our next trip to Coast. We both started off with the Spicy Miso soup- it was delicious! Served in heavy mug and topped off with slices of jalapenos!  For sushi we order the King Crab and White Dragon.I really like the White Dragon as it was extremely flavorful. I would go with the White Dragon again and maybe try something else next time instead of the King Crab-another it was very good as well. For dessert  my friend got the lychee sorbet and I got two little mochis- the white chocolate raspberry one was awesome!!  Over all Coast is very intimate and a great date place an very well priced.

Mostly because Coast takes sushi beyond the level you expect out of any casual-style sushi joint on the block... or the entire city. I'm not going to take any time talking about what makes sushi good. Let's put it this way, if it's not fresh, clean and tasty, we're probably not Yelping about it.  So let's get straight to what makes Coast different. First, the quality is superb--that's not really a difference maker, it's just something to know. Second, don't mess around with the menu. Ask about the specials and just say 'yes, please... yes, all of them. Yes, yes, all of them, thanks.'  If you want the standard spicy tuna and spider rolls, come on in. If you want innovative specials and cool rolls that will blow your mind and your taste buds, welcome home.

We were on a double date, and my wife and I were leaving the tip -- you know how these things go.  We rounded to the nearest quarter leaving an average tip (for our average service).  What happened next ruined the experience for the whole evening.  Our waitress inquired about problems with the service to which we replied that there were no ""problems.""  When she then commented that our tip was less than 15% and that was why she was asking.   Turns out, by my quick mental math, I left 14.9%.  Shame on me, but the difference between that and 15% was less than $0.20.  Was it really worth embarrassing me in front of my wife and friend over $0.20?  To potentially loosing a somewhat regular customer? There are many more tactful ways to seek out feedback.  Suggesting that someone is cheap in front of their friends (esp. over a rounding error) is not the path to providing better customer service.  Cris, my guess is that you had an off night, but don't expect another opportunity from us to redeem yourself.",-0.9496,0.795,0.077,0.128,0.4087132003798671

My specialty rolls were more so along the lines of common rolls both in size and taste. Simply adding some color or garnishments doesn't demand the term ""specialty"". I only had two rolls, and maybe those were lesser flavorful. I'm playing devils advocate.  The highlights of Coast is the decor. It is very much date worthy. It is dimly lit with a modern japanese feel. The location is great, and off the busy streets where so many other sushi spots are situated.

Don't get me wrong, it's def good, but if I remember correctly, it's on the pricier side.  I have been here multiple times, especially for bday celebrations so I guess that would make it a sorta ""special occasion spot""?   Well, whatever the case, it's good stuff - it just doesn't necessarily pop into mind when I'm needin my sushi fix.  With that said, I'd prob be back for another occasion should someone decide to have it there.",0.9808,0.784,0.209,0.008,0.6006069094304388

The only things keeping this place as 4 stars instead of 5 for me are below: 1. Parking can be a bit dodgy.  I recommend getting a cab or walking if you live nearby. 2. Crowded.  If you know you are going to go there to eat, be sure to make reservations well in advance. 3.BYOB policy.  They changed this a couple of years back.  Instead of being able to bring whatever booze you wanted you are now restricted to either 1 750ml bottle of wine or six pack per two people.  You can get around this by simply asking the hostess or manager when you arrive if you can bring in more.  They do not enforce the rule very hard and I typically bring in a bottle of wine and a six pack of gluten free beer every time I go there with my fiance.",0.9476,0.851,0.11,0.038,0.6565749007936508

Another bonus is that its BYO :)  Coast has a very cool ambience and can be quite intimate, but it's also great to enjoy with a group of girlfriends (they do have seating for larger groups).  Remember to make reservations; even with reservations, we ended up waiting about 20 minutes for our table.",0.9637,0.81,0.19,0.0,0.5806944444444444

2010-09-07,5.0,"In our journey to find the best sushi in Chicago, Coast was stop number two for my friend and I. And, thank goodness it was such an early restaurant in our quest, because we learned a very valuable lesson in sushi: Listen. To. Your. Server. To preface, we got a table right away, which was great. The restaurant is pretty large, very conducive to pairs or slightly larger groups. It had a trendy vibe without being obnoxious, and all the staff came off as very friendly. After we were seated, our server came over and suggested his favorite rolls on the menu, and also took the time to point out some specials that were written on a chalk board behind the counter (which we never would have noticed otherwise). Per his suggestions, we ordered the White Dragon (everyone's favorite and for a darn good reason), the Volcano, the Popper (from the secret chalk menu) and the  Ebi Tempura. Oh, and some wasabi oysters to start. Phenomenal. The oysters were such a tease, we each had one and wanted more. But it definitely set the tone for what we were about to experience. The White Dragon is to die for, the combination of sauces and goodness within was perfect. The Volcano was presented in, well, as a volcano. Which was cool, and it was just spicy enough so that it lived up to its name without making you lunge for your water. The Ebi tempura was fabulous, however disappointing that it only came with 4 pieces. I would have gladly had more. And, last but not least, the Popper. Oh. My. God. We had to order a second roll because we were so thunderstruck with its awesomeness. It's a sushi chef's take on a jalepeno popper, thats the best way to describe it. Jalepeno and cilantro blended perfectly with fish. I think it's just a special roll that makes it's appearance whenever Coast sees fit, but it should become a regular. It's to die for. All in all, I was very pleased with my Coast experience. I'll definitely be back once I'm done questing around the city for my ""perfect sushi"" project.",0.9945,0.784,0.183,0.033,0.5626024768881911

Cons 1.  Always crazy crowded.  You should call for a reservation or you will most likely be waiting for a looong time. You can drink in the waiting room though so, you know, score.  You could probably get a table if you get there right when they open but let's be honest, who does that?? 2.  The wait staff has never been particularly friendly, but they are certainly professional.  Sort of like a coworker you get along with, but would never have a beer with. 3.  It is priced just enough where it wouldn't be an everyday sushi place.  It's sort of like the difference between Olive Garden and Maggiano's.  It's the Maggiano's of Sushi. 4.  Expect to feel out of place if you aren't on a date or part of a girls night out.  Personal experience I know, but it still hurts all the same.

2010-08-12,1.0,"I used to love Coast, and it's been a long time since my husband and I have been there so we decided to try it out again on a random weeknight.  We were told the wait would be 30-45 minutes, which is a long time but hey, good for them for being so packed!  We waited in the waiting area and asked the host if he could chill our champaign - he curtly told us we would get a chiller when we sat at our table....ok fine.  So with the long wait, and since we couldn't have our bottle chilled, we decided to open it and have a drink while we waited (we all know what happens when a cold bottle of bubbly warms up and then you open it - wanted to avoid that!).  My husband asked the same tall, curly haired host if we could get 2 wine or champaign glasses, he gave us 2 warm water glasses.  Not a big deal, but we were drinking some pretty good bubbly and I wanted something with a stem.  So I asked him for 2 wine glasses, his response: you'll get them when you sit down.  Yes, I know - but we're drinking it now, and will bring it with us when we sit down.  He rolled his eyes, huffed and said to hold on while he gets them.  Excuse me??  I am not being demanding here.  He was a pretentious jerk who didn't seem to like his job in the least. On the bright side, we only had to wait about 15 minutes before we were sat.  Out waitress was very friendly and helpful, and we ordered a bunch of rolls that we remembered we loved.  Now I said before that I haven't been to Coast in a long time, and when we started eating our food I remembered why.  Coast maki is the kind of maki that beginners like, or people that don't really like fish like.  It's the kind of maki that's drenched in fried tempura and mayo sauces that while it is quite tasty, you cannot taste the fish (except for the Creamy roll - yum).  In addition, the portions are so small that we were left hungry (after ordering a lot).  For example, the White Dragon that was always my favorite roll - it's basically a roll covered in tempura with eel and mayo sauce on it - well that's all I tasted, if I didn't see the ingredients on the menu I would have no idea what was actually inside of it - and for $14 (I think) it was the exact same size as the regular rolls.  Perhaps my tastes matured?  Maybe I've had truly good sushi too many times to think that Coast food is actually good (compare Coasts White Dragon to Oysy's White Dragon and you'll see what I mean)?  I don't know, but while I liked it (heck, I like fast food sometimes too) it was not what I consider to be maki.  So, while the décor is absolutely lovely and the byob aspect is great, I will probably not return to Coast as I know what good sushi is and it's not at Coast.",0.9969,0.807,0.154,0.039,0.4902595926532099

By the time I left around 8, it was even more packed. The good news has traveled fast apparently. The rolls are phenom. They have their specialty maki and a few others on their regular menu that I've never even seen at other places. Ordered the Ceviche, Spicy Scallop, Rainbow, and Spicy Sweet Potato. My favorite out of all of them? The sweet potato. It's their vegetarian best seller and I'm not even a vegetarian! It had a hint of spiciness balanced by the sweetness of the potato and I really liked the crunchy texture. The other rolls were just as delish and were well rolled so I didn't have to worry about my amateur chopstick skills butchering the presentation.

That said, I was able to watch several groups walk in/out and get the response from the hostess that the wait will be hour or two. Of course, all seemed annoyed which I deduced from the eye rolls, arm movements, and language. Moral of this story is make a reservation! They also are more than happy to allow you to open your BYOB (awesome) beverage in the waiting section (only room for 10 or so). They do offer the ability to take your number and call you when a table is ready.  Third, the bathroom is single use. Given the number of tables in the restaurant and already established high volume of patrons. This really was annoying.

2010-08-09,2.0,"I will start off by saying that the sushi and other food is delicious. But this is Chicago, good sushi is not hard to find. Turns out good service is. I went August 5 for a good friend's birthday. We chose the location because we all love sushi and who doesn't love a good BYO? We had made a reservation for a party of 11. The restaurant was not very crowded at all this Thursday, which might be why they kindly seated us before the whole party had arrived (or perhaps that's their policy - a good one!). We sat down and our waitress came to introduce herself. It was Kim by the way. Not one smile. There were only four of us so far, but she kept trying to get us to order an appetizer. I appreciate the initial offer, but we said no a couple of times. Let it go. Or not, it did eventually work and we ordered some edamame, but talk about pushy. We had several bottles of white wine but we were informed she could only give 2 chillers per table. Despite the fact that in reality we were 3 tables pushed together. Finally 9 of us had shown up, and we'd gotten texts from the other 2 that they probably were not going to make it. Kim did not like this one bit. She said ""so how many will you be? The reservation was for 11. I need to figure out the numbers."" Birthday girls said ""looks like we'll just be 9, the other two are maybes at this point so we'll order without them."" As if birthday girl hadn't spoken Kim says ""So your whole party isn't coming? How many will be here? Not 11?"" What the heck? What ""numbers"" is she figuring out?  There were going to be 11, now there are 9. Done. Figured. Get over it. Parties of 5 or more include gratuity if that was her concern, she's still covered there because her attitude would have certainly cost her a few percent if I could have chosen myself. The difference between 9 and 11 isn't much and honestly, we would have needed the same table size for 9 people anyway. Fast forward to dessert. The birthday girl hushes the table and announces she has something to tell us all. She gets about 3 words out and Kim comes back and asks if we want to order dessert. Now, I think it was obvious 8 of us were hanging on birthday girl's every word, but Kim didn't notice. That's fine. Birthday girls says ""could you please give us a moment?"" Kim says ""sure"" but first lists off all the desserts while we all stare in wonderment. When she's done she stands there, and asks if we know what we want. Birthday girl says ""could you please just give us a minute?"" Exasperated sigh by Kim and she stalks off.  We did order dessert, and she did put a candle in birthday girl's, which was very sweet. But I don't think I saw more than one smile over 2.5 hours. We had to flag her down to ask her to open wine for us, and we never did get more than 2 chillers. If you're going to be BYO, be BYO. Don't half ass it and act put off that you have to do some extra work.  Despite the good food, I'll never go back to Coast because of Kim.

There were a couple of standout rolls, and nothing was bad, but beside the White Tuna Cream Roll, the sushi was forgettable. The service was very good and parking wasn't a problem since we arrived pretty early. The BYOB was great, but they did impose pretty strict limits (1 bottle of wine per 2 people max).

I tried Coast for the first time on the suggestion of my friend who probably found it here on Yelp. I've tried many a contemporary-designed-kinda-upscalish-looking sushi joint from Shine to Japonais (Japonais is overrated, btw) to SushiSamba so cute decor doesn't really impress me anymore, but admittedly, Coast was really pretty. A little more intimate also. And dark, but I'll get to that later.  I got there way earlier than the rest of my party, so I walked a half-block down to fetch a bottle of wine (i dig BYOB places!) and waited up front. The waiting area is big and doesn't make you feel awkward, which I appreciate.  So only a couple cons here: We had a party of 8 and our table was ready immediately, which was great, but set up in such a way that no one could get into their seats without having to literally climb over and maneuver chairs and people from our table AND the table behind us. Very unsexy. Also it was RIDICULOUSLY dark in there. I had to either hold my menu face-level to catch light from the table behind me or practically set the thing on fire with the tiny candle. More unsexy behavior. Ambiance is great, dudes, but a tiny bit more light would have made it more comfortable. On the upside, I totally could've gone out to dinner with no makeup and no one would be the wiser.  I admittedly get unreasonably annoyed by little things, so the dark and the squished table setup could have formed a venomous opinion right there, but the food and service was great! I got a sashimi plate and each piece of sashimi was soooo good. I don't think I really knew what ppl were talking about with ""melt in your mouth"" descriptions until then. Totally perfect. Plus, I felt totally satiated with the small sashimi plate, which incl miso soup (welcome on a chilly night!) and some rice. Most everyone else in my party got rolls and really seemed to like them.

Walking in, you notice the extremely friendly staff that greets you at the door (even the sushi chefs said hello as we walked into the foyer). We were able to find a seat right away on a Sunday night when it was moderately busy. The atmosphere was dark but still welcoming. Our waitress (who's name i forget, I wish i remembered but she was tall with maybe dark blondish/light brownish hair) was helpful and very friendly. She gave us detailed explanations on what hamachi and tobiko was and recommendations if we liked a certain thing. The food was so good that we ordered roll upon roll until I felt my wallet scream for mercy. I wish I knew this place was BYOB, then we would have bought a bottle and maybe stayed longer.

Decor was the usual dark and trendy looking atmosphere.. Nothing really original there.. As far the sushi goes, I thought the quality was pretty good. I liked the coast crab maki and the volcano roll. The Po' boy maki had lots of fish in it, but it kind of felt like House of Sushi in taste..  So the food was good. I wouldn't say it' is as good as some of my favorite places, but it's definitely better than most. What sucked was the wait to be served. It was excessive and since we were dining so late we were absolutely starving by the time the food came.

When we were finally able put in our first sushi order it took FOREVER to receive.  Granted, the place was pretty hopping and I could see the sushi chefs cranking out rolls as fast as they could, but I think that if a couple of the rolls were ready then our waitress could've brought them out to us.  Instead, I'm convinced that she waited until the last possible moment to get us our rolls; it took about 30 minutes to receive our first round of sushi.  The rolls that were supposed to be warm were not warm at all.  I will say that the second round of sushi came out much faster than the first.  I think it only took about 15 minutes. We got quite an array of sushi rolls and they all tasted pretty good.  At the urging of our dining partners we ordered a couple of the White Dragon rolls and I was not disappointed with the taste.  We actually ordered two more in our second round.

Another small disappointment was the crunch rolls.  The rolls are literally covered in a giant pile of tempura crumbs.  You actually have to dig out the sushi from under the pile.  The taste was good, but not what I expected at all. On the plus side, the spicy miso soup is to die for.  It is a very flavorful soup infused with fresh jalapenos...yummy.  We also got the fresh oysters that were flown in that day.  Holy crap were they excellent; creamy, flavorful, no sand....absolutely amazing.

Judging by my list and other reveiws, I am obviously a big fan of sushi.  So when I saw the write up on this month's Chicago magazine on Coast with the gorgeous food-porn pictures of the sushi, I literally dropped my plans to grill out and caught the bus to Coast. Neato thing #1:  Our waiter was just plain awesome.  He knew all the specials front and back, made solid recommendations, knew the somewhat obscure wine we brought (and gave it the thumbs up), joked around with everyone, and pretty much was a total pro.  Neato thing #2: Coast has a really interesting menu.  A lot of the sushi places I go to (as a notorious cheapskate) are, well, totally basic.  Even the basic makis at Coast had a twist on them.  My absolute, total favorite was the spicy creamy.  I have never had sushi literally melt in my mouth like that.  The texture, the flavors, all of it were just perfect.  And for 8 bucks. Score! Neato thing #3: BIG ASS MAKIS.  'Nuff said. Not so neato thing:  Meh on the tempura.  Shrimp tempura rolls have been the barometer by which I measure sushi places in the past.  Coast just threw this formula out the window because their shrimp tempura had a flavor remniscent of Long John Silver's, but everything else was freaking fabulous.  Onto more neato things. Neato thing #4: Huge selection of sashimi & nigiri.  I tried clam, bonito (some sort of awesome tuna cousin), and black tobiko.  Apparently they have sea bass also.  Way more selection than I'm used to seeing on sashimi menus. Neato thing #5: Their desserts here are really awesome looking.  I'm used to green tea ice cream, weird looking puddings, or nothin' at sushi places.  They had something chocolatey and really pretty here and the girls at the table next to me got it and I couldn't stop ogling it.  If I hadn't been stuffed to the gills (BAD PUN ALERT!), I would have gotten one too. Overall, mostly quite neato and definitely worth a go.",0.9907,0.823,0.146,0.031,0.5319498069498071
2009-10-09,4.0,"A romantic dinner....for 4 Love love love Coast....and so do a lot of people.  By 8 pm on a Tuesday night, the place was poppin' and there were at least 20 others waiting to be seated. Why I love it:  BYOB!  Easy street parking (rare in Bucktown)!  The Tuna Carpaccio special! Why it's not getting 5 stars:  Wonk-wonk on the Ceviche Roll and the $16 price for their Yakisoba dish (basically a handful of noodles with a couple pieces of asparagus thrown in). What we ate:  Tuna Carpaccio - Tangy, spicy, buttery.  Negihamachi, Spider Roll, Spicy Tuna, Spicy Tako, salmon with avo - ALL solid and delicious.  Spicy Tuna Crunch - Very flavorful but I felt I lost the buttery tuna texture in all that tempura crunch.  Ceviche Roll - Meh.  It was weird.  A chunk of jalapeno, a chunk of mango, a chunk of scallop.  It was listed under their signature dishes, so we decided to try it.  It was ok, I would never order it again.  Dessert was chocolate mousse with ice cream - perfect end to the meal. We were ""Those People"" and had our kids with us.  In our defense, it was our anniversary, we ate early (7 pm) and even requested a table away from the crowds so as to not disturb our fellow sushi-eaters.  My kids (ages 3 and 2) are foodies-in-training so they were awesome.   Anyway, they ate some of the soft shell crab, a bite of the salmon roll, miso soup and the yakisoba noodles.  If I'm at a sushi place, the last thing I'm going to order is noodles and that's probably what Coast figured...why else would they charge $16 for this?  That's the cost of 2 makis!  Either way, the kids gobbled it up so it was all good. We've dined there numerous times without the kids and the host/wait staff was always good.  But with the kids, there was no judgment, no weird looks.  In fact, they were extra accommodating and sweet.  They are the reason why I'm taking the time to write this review.",0.9891,0.82,0.141,0.039,0.5868571428571429

The Coast Crab (one of their signature rolls), Fresh Philly and Spicy Salmon are our go-to favorites but we did try a Spicy Tako roll and the Spicy Creamy that were equally pleasant morsels.

Still, the both the food and the service were perfect . I wouldn't say it's the best sushi ever, but the server was honest and steered us in the right direction, and we enjoyed every bite.  We had the scallops and the soft shell crab appetizer to start, both very tasty. We ate our way through four rolls and a piece of nigri:  white dragonroll, coast crab roll, po boy roll, white dragon roll. Suzuki nigri because I love me some sea bass.

2009-08-21,3.0,"Chicago for sushi.   It's a cause for concern for someone who comes from LA, where sushi joints and ""fusion"" restaurants outnumber liquor stores.  I don't pretend to be a sushi snob, but I can tell the difference between the places that sell you fish and the places that sell you the restaurant. This was the latter.  Went for a friend's birthday.  Tried a roll or two, which were alright (though everyone from Illinois was impressed), my teriyaki salmon ( I prefer shioyaki) was almost fast food bowl fare dressed up as fine dining.  And I realize now that the hamachi carpaccio, which was oversalted and overseasoned, seems sort of antithetical to the concept of sushi.  Okay, so maybe I am a bit of a sushi snob, but I actually like the taste of the fish. The GOOD thing about this place is the BYOB policy, which is limited to wine, beer, and sake, but really all you need when you eat sushi.  This is the nicest BYOB place I have ever been to.  You can get TOASTED here and the wait staff was very accommodating for it.  And honestly, when you're going to get that drunk (like many of us were trying to) good sushi is sort of a waste, and 'good enough' sushi will do just fine.  Except that you pay a premium dollar for it.  We all still had a good time.

2009-08-19,5.0,"How in the world have I never ever eaten here??? On a rainy day where I was supposed to go to the grand opening of a restaurant in Hotel Felix, the rain combined with interminable traffic led to a disastrous ride through traffic, watching cars cut us off and plenty of staring at red lights that refused to turn green. As the hours ticked away, it was apparent a change in plan was necessary and we rolled out to Coast Sushi. before the obligatory trip, we stopped at the nearby 7-Eleven and rocked ourselves a six-pack. Good thing we did not get a twelver as I read on the menu after we sat down that a six pack was the maximum allowed for two people! Service was prompt and the server brought a bucket of ice for the sixer and stood ready to take orders. Not being ready, we let her know we needed more time. As I perused the menu, there were plenty of specialty house makis featuring many an eel ingredient including eel sauce, but I switched over to the maki and the kitchen entrees.  Sushi plates ranged from $21-$27 featuring a variety of sushi and sashimi specials. Other entrees included, NY strip steak, chicken teriyaki and tempura dishes for $16-$20.  On the maki side I decided to delve into crunchy spicy tuna maki, spicy white tuna maki and spicy salmon maki and a bowl of miso soup. The miso went down quickly and the sushi came quickly after. My eyes lit up as the crunchy maki tuna maki was topped off with a generous pile of panko bread crumbs so I could take other maki rolls and roll them around the pile to render them all crunchy!!!! Ginger was plentiful and the soy was great. Unlike Kaze Sushi, Coast Sushi portions are large and will fill you up even after housing your plate faster than hyenas after the kill. With sushi gone, the busboys rolled in faster than thunder after lightning and whisked our plates away.  The music in Coast was chill ambient lounge music while the lighting was dim and ambient. The black wooden tables showed some signs of wear and tear, reflecting the raw popularity of Coast.

2009-06-12,5.0,"Angie's List of Reasons Why I Love Coast:  1. Variety - There's no shortage of maki rolls on the menu at Coast. Some personal faves are the Coast Crab, Ceviche, Sunrise, White Dragon, Wasabi and Sweet Potato (Don't judge. It's awesome).  2. Bite sized pieces - Sounds like an odd selling point, right? But I love the fact that the rolls are small enough to be bite sized. This means I'm not battling with having to take down a roll slice in 2 or 3 bites, which is messy. And you don't get every flavor into your mouth at the same time. And let's be honest, it's pretty unladylike. So the one bite roll slices at Coast are tops.  3. BYOB - Although there is an annoying new rule that you can only have 1 bottle of vino per 2 people. Pffft....  4. Relatively inexpensive - We're not talking dirt cheap sushi (actually, really cheap sushi kind of scares me), but it's affordable.  I love Coast. It's one of the best around. Although I always TRY other sushi joints, I always come back to Coast. Kind of like a good for nothing ex-boyfriend that you just can't let go...",0.9814,0.778,0.174,0.048,0.5349695938981653

The white dragon roll was probably the best thing that I've ever had in my mouth. It was so good that we ordered another one along with a shrimp tempura atop a roll with asparagus inside.

Host: Uhh..closest cross street is Ashland.  Me: Great! Do you take reservations Host: Ummm..if you would have called a week ago maybe. But not now.  Me: Ok, whats the wait right now.  Host: A half hour at the least.  Me: Ok, well we are about 5 minutes away in our cab, would it be ok for me to put our name it now? Host: No Me: Ok well we'll be there soon. Thanks (Click) When we got there, a different host (female, the one on the phone was male) didn't even take our names. We were seated right away. Um ok? I thought the atmosphere was nice...but it was so loud! I dont mind a loud resturant but my date and I were practically yelling at eachother. We ordered some miso soup and instead were brought edamame. When they brought our soup, the waitress realized our mistake and took the edamame away. It was a little confusing because some sushi places give free edamame...why were they taking it away? I only had one! haha All our rolls were brought out at the same time which i liked. But I didn't like how the waitress tried to upsell us on almost everything we ordered (Namasake? The fatty salmon is much better you want that instead? No! Its three dollars more) As far as taste goes, it was very similair to most other sushi places ive been in the city. Pretty good but nothing blew me away. I do not reccomend the Sunrise roll ( i think thats what it was called.) It has mango and mint. I thought I'd love it but it tasted like a mojito in not a good way.

Only 1 bathroom stall each for men and women, so don't wait until you're about to burst to go, b/c will probably be a line. They have a wide variety of Mochi flavors, some of which I've never seen on other menus, like Tiramisu.  Loved the mint chip Mochi, that was my favorite out of the 5 I've tried.

Speaking of the Miso soup, it was delicious.  And don't worry, they do have spoons if you are hopelessly Western like me and want to scoop out every last bit of tofu goodness. Next was the toro sashimi.  Heavenly.  As promised, it practically melted on your tongue. We followed with three different rolls (Spider - a personal favorite, Alaska, and Hamachi Jalapeno).  My date picked the Hamachi Jalapeno, and to be honest, I wanted nothing to do with it (Jalapenos?  Gross.  No thanks.  All yours, buddy).  However, when they arrived, I had to try one (all in the name of Yelp, yo) and they were shockingly good!  The jalapeno was very subtle - a very pleasant surprise.

I'm quite familiar with sushi and sashimi, but I don't necessarily know the word for ""eel sauce"" in Japanese! When I'm out for dinner, I don't feel like trying to impress the servers with my culinary knowledge... Within one minute of having our plates cleared (see above) she appeared asking us if we wanted dessert or just the check. I don't know why she felt the need to push us out the door so quickly, as the place was only half-full. If there's one thing I can't stand, it's being pressured and bullied by the servers and I think the good intentions of this crew fall into that category. I thought it was expensive for what you get, especially when you're pushed out the door before you're ready to go.",0.9551,0.808,0.13,0.062,0.488095238095238

The spicy sweet potato is really tasty, but the asparagus could have been more tender.  We finished it off with the dessert special--flourless chocolate dome filled with white and milk chocolate mousse, accompanied by strawberries, vanilla ice cream and fudge sauce.  I liked it because it wasn't too sweet and was nice and light, so even though we were stuffed with sushi, the dessert didn't take us over the edge.  I was apprehensive about the service since it's gotten mixed reviews on Yelp, but our server was super nice and helpful!",0.9924,0.777,0.194,0.03,0.5489130434782609

2009-02-13,4.0,"Went here last night for an early Valentine's Day dinner.  I'd say it's closer to 4.5 stars than 4.  First impressions: This place is BIG, and DARK. I don't know why, but I thought the place would be much smaller than this. It's not actually so big, but it has two rooms and seem crowded because they really know how to pack the tables in. As far as atmosphere, I really liked the dim lighting and the decor, but it's a little too romantic for how loud and crazy this place can get. If you seat 60 people in a small room, it's gonna get loud.  Because of the loudness, I wouldn't recommend this place for a first date. I couldn't hear the server when she was telling us about the specials (she was also a bit of a mumbler, so that didn't help), and it was hard to hear my boyfriend at times. We didn't mind shouting, but this is definitely not a cozy, quiet place. The food: We started off with the awesome spicy miso but decided against more appetizers so we'd have more room for fishies. We had the white dragon roll (AMAZING! Get it and thank me later), the Sunrise roll with mango, tuna and mint (very good as well), the spicy scallop roll (lots of stuffing, not much rice = perfect) along with some super white tuna (buttery and delicious) and some toro (expensive fatty tuna, but yummy for a special occasion). I had dessert waiting at home, so I can't comment on that. Just looking around other tables made me want to order more rolls though I was completely stuffed. The service: Meh. That pretty much sums it up. Our server was okay. She seemed bored and was really soft-spoken. I don't really care much about service, but she did get annoying at the end of the meal with clearing our table 4 or 5 times to send us the message that it was time to leave. At one point, we joked that she'd come back and blow out our candle. She also took the check after we'd paid and before we were ready to leave to get her tip which I always think is just a tad rude.  Overall, I will definitely come here again for a special occasion type night when I want to bring only one bottle of alcohol for 2 people. (Our food came to over $20 per person so no fee, but I heard they charge a corkage fee if you don't meet this requirement. That's just tacky.) The sushi was good and it came out very fast for us, though I've read other people had to wait quite some time.

Nope - they are full of fresh ingredients, with just the right amount (i.e. small) of rice.

On a busy night, it looks like they run out of wine glasses, so we also did not mind the juice glasses for our wine - European, our server said (?). What we did mind was the following:  *My dirty wine glass  *Forgetting our edamame  *Our server disappeared for 20 min mid-meal and for most of that time, what looked to be our sushi was sitting in the window where multiple servers and customers eyeballed it, smelled it, and passed it by. Not knowing if it was ours, we didn't say anything, but sure enough, when Houdini reappeared, we were served. We were the first two chairs at the sushi bar - any server or sushi chef could have handed it over without going out of their way at all.  *The case of the missing sushi - the fish inside the rolls has disappeared! The white dragon - always a solid choice - was half the size it normally is, and in the popper, I would have needed a microscope to see the smoked salmon.  *The one time my water glass was filled, I also got a bonus - floaties.

2008-11-04,4.0,"Wow, 278 reviews before me? Guess I'll keep this one to the basics:  -BYOB, which is great. No corkage fee which is even better. There is a limit of one bottle for two people or one six-pack for two people...and just beer/wine/sake, no other liquor. They didn't seem to be enforcing that rule, but it was a slower Monday night with no one waiting to be seated.  -They do take reservations. Great for our party of ten.  -Seriously awesome miso soup. No spoons, which was strange, but handles for easy sipping.  -Edamame was served a little cold and with little to no salt. I like mine piping hot with lotsa salt, so this was a little disappointing.  -The sushi was pretty good. Definitely not the best I have had, but I've had worse (then again, I am no sushi expert, so what do I know...). Tried the una avo (good sauce), crunchy spicy tuna (more crumbly tempura crumbs, but alright), spider (my favorite), volcano (spicy, but that's about all it had going for it, and it left me yearning for my delightful Bentonara volcano roll with the secret sauce), and I had a bite of the White Dragon...not bad.  -Pricing was pretty reasonable, given that the ambiance is pretty great for a BYOB. No silly explanatory pictures on the wall, just calming zen-like setting with dim lighting and warm colors.   I felt like I was in a place where I should have paid much more.  And the presentation of our food was lovely. -Service was adequate, but not overly friendly.  I do appreciate that they accommodated our large group and worked with us on the check.

It had a lot of fun things included in it and the main fish was yellowtail, I believe. So when the waiter returned, we agreed to order the special as well as a white tuna roll. A few minutes later the waiter returned to inform us that they had run out of a few key ingredients of the special roll, but the sushi chef could make another special roll consisting of ""white tuna and ginger"" for us if we'd like.  So my complaint is mostly with the waiter because we'd already ordered a tuna roll and he offered to serve us another one instead of the exciting variety that had previously excited our minds and tastebuds.  The food arrived promptly and on pretty platters, so no complaints there. The pseudo-special roll was great with a surprise crunch and a perfectly finely graded tuna. It send the ""sushi happiness high"" chemicals straight to the brain and down my arms.  If only the waiter had been a bit more educated.

We make a reservation, normally a couple of days (or hours) in advance.  Recommend using the days in advance when wanting a spot thurs- sun.  And they have never treated us wrong.  And sometimes we come to party- nine or ten people deep.

We went on a Wednesday night (I believe) and weren't aware that it was BYOB. They didn't have a table ready for us for our reservation but it worked out because we needed to walk down to the store for some drink. We returned with some beer and had to wait some more for a table. They assured us it wouldn't be more than 10 more minutes. 30 minutes later, we were seated. Our waiter was very nice and funny, and he even gave us a little bit of free sake since we were the last ones there (we waited forever!). The sushi was alright, sometimes it depends on the day of the week that you go, but it seemed a little bland and just not up to par. We got several pieces of Nigiri and also a few rolls (spicy creamy, and something with eel). All of it fine, just not great. The lighting in Coast is a little strange too, around the perimeter are spot lights that point down on you if you're sitting in the bench seat side of the tables for 2. They kept dimming and brightening them all night. That was a little annoying. At one point it was so dark in there that the candle seemed too bright so we blew it out.

I have to agree with the little girl, Coast is quite good.  But you are probably wondering why I only gave it 4 stars.  Well, when I sit at the sushi BAR, I expect to order and talk to the sushi chef.  That's where the real magic happens.  However, not at Coast.  You order from a server.  The guys behind the counter get really taken aback when you try to order for them.  Don't make the same mistake we did, just sit and wait until someone comes to you. I'm a big fan of trying the ""designer sushi"" or ""specialty rolls"".  I like to see how creative the sushi chef's can get.  Coast did not disappoint. We ordered 6 rolls.  The most interesting roll was the Sunshine roll with ginger soaked tuna wrapped with mango.  The tastiest roll was the Po'Boy, with the White Dragon Roll coming in a close second. We went around 6:45 on  a Wednesday and there was already a wait for a table without a reservation, so we decided to sit at the sushi bar.  We got served right away (well, after I tried to order from the Sushi chef who seemed slightly confused). The place was a bit loud, but it wasn't too terrible.   The rolls we had were very good and a little on the pricey side.  Again, we had the designer suhi, not the regular maki or negri rolls.   Those looked quite reasonable, even their dragon roll.  And if you BYOB, if you order at least $15 per person they waive their $5 per person corkage fee.  So easy to do with sushi. :) We will definitely be back.  There are two more specialty rolls we want to try in addition to see how they do their regular rolls.  Service was good.  Overall very happy, except for the fact that I can't order from or talk to the sushi chef.",0.994,0.841,0.154,0.005,0.514663715913716

We also tried the edamae, the warm shrimp salad (sweet corn tempura was interesting in a good way), agadashi tofu, and ceviche. I'd pass on the ceviche as a family style sharing dish.

Matt was our horrendous waiter. Our party of four arrived to celebrate a bday at 5:30pm for our reserveration. we were among the first tables seated that night. our table was precariously wobbly and not able to be fixed with the folded napkin trick. after asking the waiter if we could shift over to any of the 10 empty tables surrounding us, he snapped and said ""all the tables are rickity and are gonna wobble"". as to be expected, this waiter had no internal clock and made our party wait excessively between serving water, popping the cork, taking our appetizer then sushi orders, etc. he proceeded to break one of the corks for the red wine without telling us and placing it back on our table. when we told him parts of the cork were still stuck in the shaft and only a trickle of wine managed to come out, he brought back a sake bottle and told us to siphon the red wine out and distribute with the sake bottle!!!!!!!!!!!  we had to make a second order since our sushi rolls were smaller than expected and what we paid for. when he came to collect the paper menus, we asked him if we could keep one in case we wanted to order more. he hesitated and said ""well ... i guess ok, but don't spill any soy sauce on it"". wtf!?!?! at the end of our miserable meal, we decided to tip about 9.54% since our service was needless to say not up to par (i.e. greater than or equal to 15% gratuity). the waiter came to our table after collecting the check and boldly said ""is there something wrong? i've never been tipped so low for a 130 dollar bill! if that's the way you guys are gonna be, then fine. but come on...""  infuriated by his audacity and cluelessness, i spoke to the manager about the waiter's poor service. she acknowledged that his behavior was inappropriate and apologized. i told her that we have never had such a poor experience at a restaurant before and would not come back. she proceeded to ask if the food was ok and did not attempt to entice a 2nd try of the restaurant with any sort of incentives.  we had such a bad experience that this night inspired me to be come a yelp member. fortunately, my future reviews have no where to go but up.",-0.8514,0.797,0.095,0.108,0.48126293995859226

Easy enough to mixup, but the server was like ""is that okay?"" I said no, I wanted salmon skin roll. When I got it, the salmon skin was burned to an awful level and it was bland bland bland. 3) I ordered a Negi White roll- it was like tuna mush. It's like they ground up the tuna and rolled it up. It was awful.  4) I ordered a shrimp tempura roll and received a shrimp tempura appetizer. I was in no mood to argue about it and so just ate it. 5) A $17 appetizer?

HOWEVER - if you are a TRUE sushi lover who understands authentic sushi/sashimi - you will be very disappointed by their sashimi.  The sashimi pieces were paper thin and the portion size for a $23 large sashimi plate was just pitiful.  When I say paper thin, I mean paper thin, when I pick the pieces up with my chopstick, it just sags over.  Most other sushi places have at least 3-4 times the thickness of the sashimi at Coast.  They don't even know how to cut the sashimi pieces correctly.  There is a reason why REAL Japanese sushi chefs go through years of apprenticeship to learn how to properly slice sashimi pieces to ensure maximum flavor and texture.  I didn't hear one word of Japanese among the restaurant staff. If you are going for the americanized rolls and don't know the difference between authentic sushi vs rolls with creamcheese and tempura crunch (cheap fillers) then by all means go ahead and enjoy. In terms of the other items - the teriyaki dishes had very small portions and hardly filling for $15-20.  Gyoza was deepfried which is a no-no.  The tempura tasted stale and the oil they used was probably old.",0.8762,0.873,0.087,0.04,0.5251140873015873

I understand this happens in busy places and with the volume in a crowded establishment it is sometimes hard to hear and understand, so fine. I ordered the UNAGI DON and the SASHIMI PLATE- I was told it would take an hour to get it to Logan Square.  After ten minutes I checked my phone and noticed several missed calls from your restaurant. I called back and was informed that my order had been taken wrong and that it would be an extra couple of bucks. Again, fine, that sort of thing happens. An hour from that point, I received another call from a number I did not recognize- this time it was the delivery person asking me to meet them at the gate- four floors down and through the courtyard. Now, I know I gave the person on the phone the exact apartment number and I also know for a fact that the buzzer works. At this point I was beginning to get annoyed. When I finally reached the delivery driver I was informed that normally Logan Square was out of delivery zone (which was never mentioned during my phone conversations with the restaurant) and informed that in the future an additional charge would be added. It felt like he was doing me some huge favor and really I have no problem paying extra- I just wanted my order correct and promptly delivered. Not to mention that was ridiculous because the driving distance between the Coast and the apartment is less than three miles! Finally, we had the food and were set to enjoy. As soon as we dug in, we could not help but admit to ourselves that it was awful. It tasted rubbery and flavorless.

I usually like sitting at the sushi bar because you get to see what's getting made - but that's not the case here. The sushi chefs are separated from the customers at the bar by design, and when the rolls are finished they're set behind a wall , hidden away from curious observers like myself, and then quickly whisked away to tables by food runners and servers. Oh, sushi sushi, you romance me so. Sadly, that is not the case here. We barely spoke to one another, my sushi rolls and I. It was like eating with an awkward stranger. While the sashimi cuts are fresh and mildly conversational, the rolls were disappointing and silent. My friend and I  ordered the white dragon and wasabi rolls - the wasabi roll was to both of our liking, but the white dragon roll was literally the size of my forearm because the rice was an inch and a half thick around a dime-sized mixture of shrimp tempura (which I couldn't see or taste), cream cheese, tobiko, and avocado.  Service was unmemorable, prices are moderate - BYOB helps that though - the restaurant itself is loud and busy,  the decor is comfortable, and the lighting is somewhat low to set the mood, whatever it may be.

2007-03-30,4.0,"Went there around 9:30PM on a Thursday evening without a reservation and had to wait about 30-40 min to get a table. We had brought a bottle of champagne and the staff was very kind to chill it for us in the mean time. In the waiting area we chatted with another couple that frequents the place and they gave us recommendations on what's a must to try. Not sure if table reservations are very helpful because people waited a while even though they had one.  We got seated at the bar and I felt the hostess had an attitude issue or was rushed too much to bother with my request to move us to one of the open tables. Luckily, our waitress was kind enough to set us up once another table freed up. I can echo the comments from other yelpers that the service is somewhat slow, mainly because there are too many tables per waitress. Other than that I was left with only good impressions from the place. The decor is modern and cozy, the light are dim and the music is subtle, all making for a hip yet romantic ambiance. The sushi was really good, and although Sushi Samba Rio is still the best on my list, this is by far superior for its price. We really enjoyed the crunchy spicy tuna and the white dragon, and the fatty hamachi and fatty salmon simply melted over our taste buds. We are definitely coming back and highly recommending Coast Sushi to anyone looking for a moderately priced indulgence in some excellent sushi.

2006-06-21,4.0,"This is one of my favorite sushi bars.  I smartly remembered to bring a bottle of white wine with me to Coast, and it was perfect with the sushi.  We had the Maine, Po' Boy, ceviche, and the coast crab maki.  It was delicious.  The have a special maki of the day or week or something like that.  I love that they mix it up, but I have seen larger menus.  I like creative makis, where you don't see a particular combination very often at all the different sushi bars.  Coast has a few, but I'd like to see more.  I don't typically order sashimi because I like the flavors and sauces that are added in the makis.  Sashimis are plain to me so I don't usually order them, but I will eat them regardless.  The ambiance is very lounge like, and lots of conversations can be heard all around.  It's located pretty close to me now, and I've already ordered take out from there!",0.9846,0.784,0.203,0.013,0.5555137844611528
2006-05-24,4.0,"This place is great! And the no corkage BYOB if you spend more then $15 is the best. Next time I go, I'm filling up my bag with beers.  The waitress recommend the supper white tuna sashimi, and... WOW amazing! Super white tuna is my new favorite. The staff is great and the place is very nice. Good place for a date. The place wasn't busy at all when I went on Sunday. The only thing Blue Fin has over this place is that Blue Fin has half priced drinks on Thursday.

We were seated a little bit earlier than our 9 pm reservation, and the waitress was excellent- she let us know that the orders were running a little slow but we didn't wait long at all. I tried the Mango Sushi with Mint, Yellowtail, and Marinated Shittake mushroom rolls... it was all excellent and so fresh tasting! I'd definately go back, though most people looked to be on dates or in small groups. Worth checking out, for sure... and nice menu selections.",0.9643,0.812,0.188,0.0,0.5292592592592592

2006-05-02,3.0,"I originally tracked this place down for their Volcano - some of the staff from what used to be Sushido went to Coast.  The food is good but for the price, there's not much differentiating them from other sushi restaurants.  If you're new to this place, their Volcano and toro is highly recommended.  This is a nice place to bring a group of friends since it's a BYOB. Make sure you make reservations (high traffic) and also bring a flash light - you'll need it to read the menu and navigate to the washrooms since this place is PITCH BLACK.",0.937,0.851,0.149,0.0,0.5642213804713805
2006-05-01,5.0,"This place has excellent sushi for the price (not cheap nor expensive, but great quality).  The salmon and yellowtail had excellent flavors.  Great trendy atmosphere with candlelit tables.  The places gets very, very busy on weekend evenings.  So be prepared to wait.  They have some couches dispersed in the restaurant and near the entrance so you can enjoy your BYOB wine while you wait your 30-60 minutes.  BYOB with no corkage fee the bill is more than 15$ per person.  Street parking on Damen can be had if you are persistent and quick.  Good date restaurant.  Okay with groups of people, but be warned about the wait time to get a table set up to accommodate you all (and the automatic 20% (post-tax) tip/service charge tacked onto your bill if you have five or more people .",0.9573,0.773,0.165,0.061,0.646

This roll is so good that some of the others can seem a little bland in comparison (like the sunrise roll).  I would recommend a reservation and they also have takeout if you are looking for great food for a night in.",0.9797,0.766,0.234,0.0,0.6592592592592592
