2017-09-03,5.0,I love this place.  I came yesterday after not having been in a few years.  I used to get sandwiches on croissants all the time but opted for the turkey panini yesterday.  The staff is super nice and accommodating; my friend really wanted Sultan's next door and they still let us sit outside on their patio which I thought was really nice.  I've never had their baked good items but I've always wanted to.  Highly recommended!,0.9807,0.708,0.292,0.0,0.4756666666666667
2017-08-29,5.0,"Warning to diabetics. This place will bring out tears, it almost did me. I like Austrian food so expected to be pleased. I was. You cannot find Austrian food everywhere. I started with the lentil soup. If you have read any of my reviews before you will remember that I am very tough on Chili and Lentil soup. When I say that I would rate the soup only 7.5, you must understand that it is still good soup. The rest of the food bursts the 9.0 on the Johnopolos scale. The dark bread that came with the soup was excellent. I had chicken Schnitzel with roasted parsley potatoes. It lived up to my expectations.  I was heart broken that I had to pass on half of the potatoes. This is where the diabetics need a strong support person. They cruelly make you walk past the famous Austrian pastries on display as you go to your table.My rule as a fat man is that I can only have a pastry that I have never had before. They had 2 so I had to pick one. That is why I sacrificed the potatoes. I have ha Napoleons before, in New Orleans so I passed on those even tho they looked very edible. There was another one that I have NOT had and I will dance with at another date. I chose the Opera Cake. It was a fine choice. I even gave half to another patron, the bigger half because it was so rich and I loved it too much. When you visit , your diet will hate me but your sweet tooth will party like a royal personage. I still regret passing the potatoes but that is not your problem. They even have along public table for singles to share.",0.9607,0.829,0.121,0.05,0.6057239057239058

I ended up choosing the fiesta skillet with multigrain bread. First off, the bread was so good I wanted more! I think they make the bread in house. The skillet itself was good, with lots of flavor, potatoes, and bratwurst. I will say there was A LOT of cheese on it though, but just ended up pushing it to the side.

I came here for breakfast with a friend and was a little early so I looked around and saw all these amazing pastries and cakes and I knew that I would have to take one home after breakfast. However: breakfast happened and I changed my mind. We sat down and waited a good 20 minutes for a server to even acknowledge us. We ordered coffee, the vienna breakfast (2 eggs, ham and swiss cheese) and the fiesta skillet. In my opinion nothing that would require a lot of time or effort. After about 10min we got the bread basket that comes with both orders, and we started eating the bread assuming that the rest would follow shortly after.  30min later we received 1(!) of the two coffees, and we asked 5 times for the other one which we ended up receiving after a full hour of waiting.  The food actually came an hour later, by which we had eaten all the bread and I asked for another slice to have with the ham & cheese. I should have known that I would wait another 30min, so when the bread finally came I gave up.  It was a full 2 hours for the easiest breakfast in the world, and I wish I could have shown my friend a good example of German/ Austrian food, but it was a complete letdown.",0.9363,0.914,0.086,0.0,0.45910493827160487

The prices were super fair and service was very attentive the entire time (we probably got checked in on every 5 minutes, and we were even sitting outside while the inside was packed).

When you go up to the counter, there is no menu or anything, which I found odd. However, if you ask, they do have menus printed for you to take a look at. I asked what was recommended, and without hesitation I was told to get a sandwich, but was warned that it's more of a fork & knife kind of meal. Challenge accepted! You get to pick scrambled eggs with any 4 other ingredients that you want, then you choose what croissant you'd like. Naturally, I went with the pretzel croissant. It's insanely cheap, which doesn't make sense to me. All of that plus bottomless Intelligentsia coffee is $8. For real. I grabbed my coffee and took a seat, and I kid you not, about 2 minutes later they brought my food out. I don't know exactly how long it actually was, but it was fast enough that I legitimately thought they brought me somebody else's food. But the fast service takes nothing away from the quality- it was ridiculously good. The fork & knife thing was a wise suggestion. I did eat it as a sandwich, but only after I pushed a ton of the scramble to the side to eat after the croissant. I mean, just click through some of the photos to see what these things looks like.

2017-04-26,4.0,"4/22 was 'Take It Slow Saturday' so  to start my day, I walked to Cafe Vienna to try a pastry- there was a line out the door (which I always like), so I decided to get my pastry to-go. There were So Many choices, I must have changed my mind five or six times before settling on the Cheese Pocket. The cheese was rich and creamy (cow), folded into a danish and dusted with powdered sugar. It was soft, sweet, and delicate.  Looking at the menu, I also decided to try the Austrian sandwich. The meats (German, Hungarian, and Genoa salami) were all new to me and I left the styrian housemade dressing on the sandwich instead of getting it on the side. I'm glad I did because by the time I arrived home, the dressing had started to soak into the rye bread and blend with the provolone cheese, adding some creaminess to enhance the smoky notes of the salami. Included was an ample garnish of pickles and black olives- I ate every single one of them. While I was waiting for my order, one of the counter workers very graciously gave me a large freshly squeezed orange juice for my birthday- one sip and I was instantly transported to an orange orchard. This was a kind gesture I will remember every time I go back to try more pastries and dishes. ------------ Came in another day for some more treats to take home: The Mini Cookies are purchased by the pound, so I decided to try two of each kind- The rainbow sprinkle was a basic cookie and didn't have much flavor, so it was my least favorite. The hazelnut cookie has a dollop of hazelnuts on top, adding a satisfying crunch in bite sized form. The caramel pecan sandwich cookies were firm on the outside and soft in the middle, creating a rich balance of yumminess. I have never tried a Pertikus before coming here, and I was not disappointed after trying them. These Austrian butter cookies have a unique flavor to them and I found I enjoyed the white chocolate dipped ones better, so I'll definitely get more of them! I thought I was finished purchasing cookies, but then I saw the Macadamia Nut & Red Velvet Macadamia Nut....couldn't decide...so I got them both. Fantastic as is, even Better warmed up for a few seconds! There is no such thing as too many macadamia nuts, and these cookies prove it! I'm glad the Elephant Ear dipped in Chocolate was only partly dipped because I actually liked the non-chocolate side better. This pastry comes with a non dipped option, so I'll buy that one in the future. Everything about the German chocolate cake was outstanding- the ratio of frosting to cake, the firmness of the slice, the coconut creaminess in the frosting, and the crunchiness of the pecans- delectable! The Cherry/Cheese strudel was tart, flavorful, and the sugar crusted pastry was crisp and delicate.  Hot Chocolate- I asked for whole milk, yet when I received it the flavors and texture were really non-existent. The barista told me they melt chocolate chips into the milk, so maybe she just didn't use enough chips...",0.9946,0.865,0.121,0.014,0.4967073886565412

I love all of the little European nuances on their menu (soft-boiled eggs, crepes, fresh squeezed orange juice!) Lunch/Dinner: Their soup is always delicious, especially the cream of broccoli. The chicken-salad sandwich is served on a buttery, flaky croissant with pickles and olives on the side (I have probably eating a few dozen of these sandwiches), but I am also a big fan of their Turkey Panini with artichoke hearts and pesto. Also, their french fries are some of my favorite fries in the entire world.  Dessert: Get a few things for yourself, as these cakes/pies/desserts are to DIE for. But especially the cheesecake tart. They put some sort of thin layer of royal icing between the crust and the filling to keep the crust from getting soggy (brilliant) and the fruit on top is always fresh!

2017-03-14,4.0,"Came here on a Saturday morning by myself and took a seat by the window. I ordered a chai tea latte (YUM!) and an egg white omelet with bacon, spinach, and goat cheese. Probably one of the best omelets I've had in the city, it was almost crispy on the outside but fluffy and bursting with ingredients on the inside. The potatoes that came with it were also delicious. My favorite part of the meal though, has to be the bread. When the server started naming all my bread choices, I went with the 'well.. what's your favorite?', which in my history is usually always a good choice. He brought out a cranberry walnut bread which is one item I would have NEVER picked. And it was fantastic!! I'm honestly still dreaming of that warm basket of bread, I'm going to have to go back for some more. I also ended up taking a rum cake to go, which I wish I would have listened to the man behind the counter when he told me it was realllllly rum-y. There was just so much rum in it that I couldn't even eat it, and I consider myself a rum lover. The cake itself would have been great if the booze was cut back just a bit.

After 35 minutes after ordering we realized our order was likely not put in. Patrons that were seated and who ordered after us got there food and paid for their bills before we got our food. Good practice for patience but we were still disappointed even after we got our food. It was simple and fair sized portions but underwhelming in taste. From the looks of the dishes around us, the croissant sandwich was a favorite along with some of the sweeter breakfast options. That might be the way to go.

The kitchen said they remade it. I can maybe get you a discount."" Clearly she did not want to help me at all. And a discount! I was LIVID. And still, not one shred of apology or remorse for the disgusting issue from earlier! I told her I was not paying for this food and they it needed to be taken off the bill. Aside from all this, my boyfriend's crepes were awful. they were hard and cold and the raspberry was basically the same jam you get from those little packets on every table. So she takes the bill and I see her at the register literally staring and pointing at me while discussing something with someone, who I can only assume was the manager. Did the manager come and apologize or say ANYTHING to me about that wad of paper? NO. It took another 20 minutes to get our bill...and another 20 after that for her to run our card. Of course by this time everyone who had come in about 30 minutes after us was already leaving.  I have never been so disgusted or insulted in my life. I will NEVER go here again.",-0.9774,0.815,0.071,0.114,0.6844265232974911

I picked up four different things for about $8. The second time, was dine-in breakfast. We went on a Sunday at 10am so the brunch rush had started. We waited about 15minutes for a table of two. However, the pastry and dessert box provided us with plenty to look at to pass the time. I had the croissant breakfast sandwich special and it did not disappoint. They offer a pretzel croissant which is flaky but holds up better than they average croissant. For $7.99 I was able to get enough food for two meals and a hot tea (which are all loose leaf). My only complaint was the service. The restaurant was very busy and it seemed that they did not have enough servers for a Sunday morning. We waited a while for our refills on our beverages and while the waitress was nice, she handed us the checks for three different groups sitting at the bar and asked us to divvy them up to everyone.

Too many apples and not enough crust. I'm all about the crust! It normally comes with vanilla ice-cream, but they ran out....and substituted with whip cream, like that's not going to make a difference...

The concept and the menu is a great idea with poor execution. I went in for brunch with my gf and ordered the eggs Benedict and blueberry pancakes. First off our food took 30 minutes from the time We ordered to the time it arrived, and it wasn't busy at all. There were maybe 3 other tables eating when We arrived. My gf ordered a crepe at first, but 10 minutes later our waitress informed us that they were out of crepes. How do you run out of crepes?! The batter is flour, eggs and milk. Maybe they have ""special crepes"". We'll never find out because we're never going back there. When our food finally arrived my eggs Benedict was not hot. It wasn't cold but room temperature. The hollandaise looked weird. Like they broke the emulsions and then tried to fix it using corn starch. The funny this is this is the first time ever I've had eggs Benedict with hard poached eggs. Usually the egg yolks are a little runny right? Not my plate, over cooked cold eggs. This was all over lookable. I can still eat and enjoy plate because I was hungry and it was edible. The ham was the best part of the Benedict.the blueberry pancakes on the other hand were beyond saving. They looked great coming out, but when I cut into one the middle oozed raw batter. I sent them back to get them redone, because I'm not going to risk getting sick over raw pancakes. Our server came back saying that it might happen again because the moisture from the blueberries caused the batter to not fully cook. This was a message from the cook, and this pissed me off, because I know how to cook blueberry pancakes and the fruit inside has nothing to do with the cooking of the batter. She offered to have the blueberries on the side, I was fine with that and continued to eat my cold Benedict while I wait for my refire of pancakes with blueberries on the side. 30 minutes later we're done eating our plates and the waitress comes back and says that the cook never got around to making those pancakes. So because the guy cooking my pancakes is incompetent to cook them right the first time and decided that it wasn't important to try to make them right, I have to leave this restaurant with a bad taste in my mouth. I didn't make a scene or anything, but I was obviously upset. There was no attempt to rectify the situation. No attempt to make sure the customer left happy. Instead I spent $40 on a crappy breakfast where I wasted over an hour and a half waiting for said crappy breakfast. If there's one thing that really pissed me off its that no one owned the responsibility for those pancakes. Instead, it was my fault for ordering pancakes with blueberries in them. It's not the fault of the guy that doesn't know how to cook pancakes. Never again. This place is now on one of my most hated  places. I never felt so ripped off.",-0.9917,0.783,0.077,0.141,0.47023924712603965

My favorite is their Crossaint Sandwich, which you can get with your pick of ingredients. Not only is their croissant buttery and delicious; but they also give you what is basically a full omelette in the croissant. It's a lot of food, but it's so good, I usually eat the whole thing.  Their pastries are also on point.

Despite being small, the menu had a lot of choices.  I got the Kaiser crepes which had smoked salmon and cream cheese, and were delicious.  It came with a side of greens which was a nice change from the usual potatoes.  My boyfriend got the breakfast sandwich on a pretzel croissant, and basically hasn't stopped talking about it since.  It was HUGE! We loved sitting at the counter looking out at the street, but there were a fair amount of tables to choose from as well.  I'm not sure if you're supposed to pay your server or at the counter (our server took ours), but when they ran our card, there was no place to put a tip which was odd.

Wanted to try the croissant sandwich, so chose some veggies and cheese on the butter croissant and got it with coffee for $8 (my husband did the same but tried the pretzel croissant).  While the butter croissant was large and fairly fluffy, the eggs were so greasy it was very unappetizing. I wanted it to be healthier, thinking this is a Vienna-like café, but instead the food still tasted very American diner-ish.

The girls working the counter were extremely friendly, informative, and helped pass the time as I waited for my food. Little did I know that they would sneak a special weekend pastry into my to-go bag! The food garners a mixed review. The schnitzel was serviceable and ordinary- I've certainly had better. The liver soup was tasty (beware of the strong smell if you're new to liver!), but the potato salad was top notch. It's a vinegar-based salad with onions- when eaten alone it's overpowering, but in tandem cuts perfectly through the rich schnitzel.  The food is frankly 3 stars. The baked goods, on the other hand?

The Asparagus sauce is really great especially with the potatoes and the eggs.  Dining in is a total hit or miss. You sit yourself and hope someone notices that you are sitting at a table.

When you do receive service, I suggest you ask for everything all at once, then when the food shows up ask for the bill. If not, you will be forgotten.

2013-05-27,4.0,"I would give this a 3.5  but the food was really good  and the coffee nice and strong.  I  am slightly biased because I've lived in Austria and I go back to visit so I'm  pretty picky about the food. I've been to my fair share of ""Austrian""  joints where  Austrian meant having a flag on the wall.I was really happy with the amount of food specific to Austria they had on offer. I had the  croissant  with egg  and it was huge. what a great buy for the money. easily could be split between two people.I also had a cappuccino  that, although it wasn't Meinl  brand (so good)  it was intelligentsia  and that is a lovely brand as well.   my only two complaints (hence the 4 stars)  was the service  and the jalapenos. there didn't seem to be a good communication system between staff members. the people next to me were literally waving  their hands in the air to catch the server's attention each time they needed something.I actually was sitting so long waiting for someone that I thought maybe I was supposed to order at the bakery counter. typical cafe service in Austria  is  super slow.  you'll wait for a minute before someone comes by. but given that we're in Chicago where people generally don't spend 1.5-2 hours talking over a meal  during the lunch hour I don't believe this cultural tradition translates as well in Chicago as one might hope. but if this is indeed the point, then the server needs to mention the Austrian cafe style upon his or her arrival at a table so patrons don't get frustrated that they can't get a cup of water but every 40 minutes.  And now: the jalapenos. they are canned/jarred, not crunchy and fresh. which means they have a gummy taste that can diminish the taste of the food.I  actually wound up picking them out of my croissant because they made an otherwise exceptional meal  taste a bit yucky.  I'm happy to go back there and try a few more things on the menu. I also am excited to try the bread.

All the food is very good, but note that it's not at all phenomenal -- we're talking deli sandwiches, apple strudel, weiner schnitzel. Nothing is ground-breaking but it's reliable, consistent, and delivers exactly what it advertises. The five-star review is for the authenticity and satisfaction you get from eating at a place like this. I find German/Austrian food to be more hearty and comforting, but less delicate and complex, than, say, French food, and that's exactly what this place delivers. In that sense, the Austrian bakery exudes the atmosphere of Chicago and what Chicagoans want to eat. We don't do finesse and delicacy here -- I don't know of a single great French bakery in the whole city. German/Austrian pastries are more up our alley.",0.9752,0.83,0.163,0.007,0.48554761904761906

When baby sister and I entered the premises, we were mesmerized by the dessert cases. We saw tons of cookies and pastries and we settled on a paczki with custard filling and I lugged back a piece of Biennenstich to our hotel room for later that evening. We ordered both to go, but we saw that the place wasn't too busy that afternoon and easily found a table where we could park our buns after hours of walking. It was a relief and we tore at the Paczki (which is a fresh doughnut-like pastry with fresh custard). It was delicious and re-charged our batteries for the rest of the day that we had. Later on, I tried the Biennenstich, which was good but if I had to choose between it and the doughnut-like dessert, I'd pick the custard-filled confection each time. I haven't had other Biennenstichs, so I'm a bad judge of how authentic or well-made it was. I could tell that it was made with expertise and some love, but it wasn't as moist as I would have liked and was quite tooth-achingly sweet. I enjoyed the almond aspect of it though. Next time I am Chicago, I would like to get my paws on the scrumptious-looking butter cookies.

The German Potato salad was actually plain ol' American potato salad. In fact it resembled the potato salad you can get from Jewel (I honestly think they buy it from them in bulk and resell it). The chicken was really just a flattened breaded fried chicken. You can get similar type of Chicken at Jewel as well while you're getting the American potato salad.

In the first time, I waited 15 minutes at the table, but I was completely ignored.  Not even water or menu!  (And it was a weekday afternoon, so far less busy then the weekend)  So I walked up to the counter, and told the waitress that I had been there for 15 minutes and nobody had helped me.  I was given a perfunctory answer and basically shooed away by the same horrible waitress impatiently.  I went back to my seat and waited for another 10 minutes.  At this point, another man who had entered at the same time at me also expressed his concern at lack of service, and he also went up to the counter, and soon he was served.  But to my shock, even after my complaint at the counter, that same waitress still did not come to help me.  I watched her --- I mean, clearly she needs to prioritize....when there is a customer who did not even have water or menu for 25 minutes at that point, she needs to help her!  So after 30 minutes, I was finally served.  Throughout my meal, she disappeared, and when it came time to pay the check, I again had to track her down and waited for 10 minutes since I asked her for the check to actually receive the check!  (It would be so easy to give me the check but she would just do other things --- this waitress needs more training!)  This experience left a sour taste in my mouth, regardless of the quality of the food. Because I love the food, I decided to bring my out of town friends to this place a few months later.  This was a weekend lunch time, so the place was packed.  Unfortunately we were served by the same rude/terrible waitress again.  She forgot one of our water, and did not bring one of the water until the middle of the meal.  One of our orders include bread, but she totally forgot about it, and we had to ask her for it (and that was the end of the meal already).  We ordered a pastry early in the meal, but she forgot the order.  At the end of the meal (which is about 1 hour later), it still didn't come, so we asked another waiter for it and finally he brought us our pastries.  Throughout the meal, she did not once refill our water.   All in all, I would say that the one waitress has been stopping me from coming to this place again.  Both times had given me (and my friends) a terrible experience.   I am surprised there aren't as many complaints about her here.  The owner should take note that they should train their waitress better!  What a shame!",-0.9801,0.825,0.063,0.112,0.4475705467372133

We have tried a lot of the places up an down Clark Street in between appointments, but we always gravitate back here.

The frittaten soup is unique and a great alternative to chicken noodle. Even if we don't eat here for lunch, we ALWAYS stop in for treats to take home, Usually a pound of mixed cookies and something from the pastry case. Coffee is a winner, and so is the hot chocolate which is European style, using milk and no where near as sweet as the American type. Love the freshly squeezed orange juice as well.

Tiramisu was very rich and flavorful - I somehow tasted wine in it but nonetheless it was very lovely. Napoleon was fluffy and creamy, also not too sweet. It was my first time trying Esterhazy and it was just oh so delicious! I love hazelnuts and all things crunchy so this easily won my heart. I didn't finish it at the store so after I brought it home for a day, it became too crunchy :( So please note: either finish it there or, finish it there, coz it's too good to let it go to waste. The store owner also gave us cookies for samples. So the reason for the 3 - we did not tell the waitress that we were going to have separate checks.

Yes, we felt sorry that it took her a long time but we didn't think that we knew well enough to have told them to split our orders coz I have never sit down in a restaurant and said to the waitress ""please put our orders on separate bills.""

So I hop on grub hub and I'm a little apprehensive about ordering chicken soup from an austrian bakery - but it seemed to be the only place I could get a GIANT bowl of chicken noodle soup delivered to me quickly and the reviews were decent - I took my chances.  The delivery was quicker than expected, which was great because poor sick me was lying in bed shivering under three blankets with a bad sore throat. (The worst!) The delivery guy was SUPER nice, and I was like wow this is a big bag of food. Then I peel off the lid of my gigantic soup (which is taped in place on both sides so my anticipation was mounting).

Ughhhhh delivery man is gone, I'm in no condition to call up and complain (my voice is gone), and I'm stuck with soup.  Just my luck to get sick RIGHT when I run out of groceries. Ahhhh I will now stock up on soups.  It made me vomit in my mouth a little bit, but I had no choice but to wipe it away, bite the bullet and eat the soup. (I know, right?! I'm nauseous thinking about it!) Granted it was good (and again, gigantic) but major ew! Hairs in food are such a deal breaker!!!

Sandwich: You got to pick 4 item in your omelet.  Mine had sausage, spinach, onion, and cheese.  We should've looked around to see if other patrons ordered this sandwich because imagine our shock when we were served a giant sandwich! we coulve easily split on and be good.  I'm not going to complain though because it was YUMMY! and I still finished it lol I wish I had more room to fit in a pastry or two.  In hindsight, I shouldve ordered a few to go but it was raining and i dindt want to lug it around while i go sight seeing.  Next time, I defintely want to try the waffles!",0.957,0.854,0.137,0.009,0.49718045112781956

The bratwurst was pretty decent though. The chocolate croissant was also beckoning, so I had to give that a try along with the hot chocolate.

A lot of love was put into that soup. Just like the kind I used to have in Germany. That was followed by the crispy schnitzel and roasted potatoes. I even saved room for a piece of black forest cake( I could only eat four bites I was so full). This is a wonderfull place. I can tell the owner works very hard( he's here whenever I come in) to ensure that everyone has a good experience. All the staff are very nice and help full too. I ran a bakery many yrs ago.

Okay, so Kate F. and I went to Austrian Bakery for lunch yesterday.  She'd been before but this was my first visit.  My boyfriend and I have been wanting to stop in for a while now.  He loves their menu but, since he lives in Germany, it's going to be a few months before he can get back here to the states so I cheated on him and went with Kate for my virgin visit.  shhhh, don't tell. When we walked in, the place was busy - a good/bad sign.  Good because clearly it's a popular place.  Bad because that sometimes means overworked and overstressed employees. We ordered our food and were a little confused about how to pay for everything.  The restaurant was full so we decided to eat outside and, since the set-up looks like it's a deli, we assumed you were to order your food, pay for it, then take it to sit down.  We weren't sure though so we asked one of the counter girls.  She said we could pay before or after so we opted to pay before.  And then we waited, thinking (silly us) that, since she'd just asnwered our question and we'd said, ""Great, we'll pay now!"" she would take our money.  And waited.  And waited.  Finally one of the guys behind the counter told us to sit down and wait for our food - we could pay afterward.  When we told him we'd really rather pay beforehand, he replied in a snippy voice, ""well obviously we're a little too busy for you to do it that way.  Go sit down.""  *sound of needle scratching on record* What?  Did he really just say that??  I cannot STAND workers with pissy attitudes.   I won't lie.  I was a little huffy.  But we sat down and waited.  Thankfully, things turned around dramatically from there.  Our food came quickly and it was good, standard fare.  Not ""write home to your mother"" good but definitely good.  And not at ALL expensive.  My sandwich (ham & cheese panini) and chips were $5.99.  Not bad at all.  Kate's farmer's salad was quite large and cost $7.99.  I mean, really.... that's, like, McDonald's prices for much better food! And then.......................and............... THEN.  We went back in to pay (no problem) but Kate said, ""Hey, Kelz?  It's your birthday.  My treat.  Pick out a goodie from the bakery, too.  I love birthdays; let's celebrate yours!""   H-what????  A......... goodie?  For ME?  How could I say no?   I couldn't.  So I didn't.  And as my eyes gazed at all of their delicious looking options, I thought to myself, ""Kelz, it's your birthday.  Pick out something decadent (but not expensive)!"" So I did.  I ordered a rum ball.  It's about the size of a tennis ball and costs $3.25. The folks behind the counter boxed up our goodies and sent us on our way.  Kate and I hugged good bye and I headed for home.  As soon as I walked in the door, I put the rum ball in the fridge.  You know.  For later.  Well.  I could hear its little rum-voice calling to me so I took it out, opened the box and admired it for a moment.  Then I decided to take a bite.  Just one.  (who was I kidding??) Oh. My. Goodness. That rum ball has got to be one of THE best sweet treats I've ever had in my life.  No kidding.  As I bit into that delicious, smooth dark chocolate infused with just the right amount of rum flavouring, I could have forgiven 100 snarky counter guys..... it was THAT good.  Seriously.

I was checking out all the wacky little restaurants on the sidewalks, and something caught my attention..... PACZKIS!!   Now, I've been reading all about Fat Tuesday in Red Eye, but since I don't know anyone Polish, I didn't really know where's the best place to get authentic Paczkis!  So, I entered the store expecting a bakery i.e. no seating, just good old bread + pastries deal... little did I know... WOW. This little bakery was packed with goodies!! From the outside, their banner & logo looks really old-school and not too attractive, but it's the cutest little cafe once you step in! The cafe is painted with a warm yellow, with a azure colored ceiling fan & traditional European instruments (accordion!) & photos adorned the walls!   Now the display fridges.... I have not seen this many cookies / strudels / cakes since I went to Europe!   The highlight of the week were the Paczkis, which is a deep fried, doughy doughnut filled with custard/ Aprikot / Raspberry! I couldn't resist these sweet-filling goodies and had to order one!  There was only 1 store assistant, with the baker in the back prepping fresh sandwiches. There was an impressive selection of bread on the back shelves, ranging from Cranberry-walnut to Poppyseed Strudel to traditional Russian bread!! Their birthday cake selections were fantastic , with 6"" cakes going for a mere $26!  While I was in the bakery, there were at least 6-8 customers who came in and they all appear to be European (most were speaking a foreign language and pronounced the strange names perfectly!). While waiting for my paczki, I looked around and found a REAL ORANGE JUICER! You get to pick fresh oranges from their basket, put it in the machine, and get freshly crushed OJ!  Now that's what I called FRESH! My paczki arrived and it was incredibly soft & chewy... the donut actually didn't taste greasy, the lightly tapped confectionery sugar floated atop the donut, and Oh-Those-Custard-Fillings....! I came back the next day right before the bakery closes, and they have the Paczkis for 50c each since they only sell freshly made pastries!!  Even though Fat Tuesday is officially over, and the bakery no longer serve Paczkis, I will definitely go back to try their loafs of bread + the amazing sandwiches. If you missed your share of Paczkis this year, do not fret - you can call Austrian Bakery and custom-order Paczkis with the fillings you desire!! =D",0.996,0.804,0.158,0.038,0.4537660976340222

The cakes, cookies, and other sweets served here are all fantastic and taste very very close to they way I remember them.  They also sell some really good breads and they have a nice little selection of European meats that I stock up on whenever I stop in.  Since Meyer's Delicatessen in Lincoln Square is no longer around, this is my alternative for some of the stuff I used to buy there.  The goose liver sausage is awesome! The service is alwasy friendly, although not very fast (that doesn't bother me), and I always have a little chat with the owner when I come in.

You can get like 20 and gobble them down in 2 minutes.  This is a must try! Lastly, the chef/ owner is a super nice guy.  He makes these crazy fabulous looking cakes - wedding style with the fondant.  There are sample cakes in the window and it looks like he's really fun and creative with them.  There's a cake with a barbie in it!

The top of the cake had dark chocolate frosting spread so perfectly smooth that it looked like fondant, only it wasn't fondant (which made me happy, because although fondant makes cakes prettier, it's not so pleasant to eat - definitely not as good as dark chocolate frosting!).
