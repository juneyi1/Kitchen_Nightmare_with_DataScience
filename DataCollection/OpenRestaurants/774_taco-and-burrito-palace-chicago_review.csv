2017-05-31,5.0,"I live in the area and, actually, closer to another Mexican restaurant that has the same quality of food that costs more. Taco & Burrito Palace is a gem in the neighborhood. The aesthetic of the restaurant is ""hole in the wall"". There are a few fast food style booth tables, a counter at the window with stools, and that's about it. That's all you need though because let's face it: you're here for some cost effective but delicious food, which, if you're a fan of Mexican food, you'll get. You go up to the counter, take a look at the menu (which is fairly extensive), and order. Don't let your social anxiety get in the way as the staff is very friendly and patient. I ordered a suizo burrito dinner, which included a burrito, beans, and rice with a few chips and veggies on the side. You can pick your fillings. I chose ground beef as my filling. The service was pretty fast and very friendly. They make everything to order, and you go up to the counter when they call your name, which was a nice touch (I didn't tell them my name, but they saw it on my credit card...so that was a pleasant surprise that was endearing). They offer up some refrigerated sauces- verde, hot sauce, etc. I chose the verde. The total cost for my ""dinner"" meal and a drink was only $11.50 with a tip ($9.50) before. This is a steal in the area. The price and quality match for once! I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but the fact that it is right near my apartment and affordable makes it a sort of ""diamond in the rough"".

After reading previous reviews, I decided to go with the super steak burrito because everyone else seemed to like it, and how hard is it to fuck up a steak burrito? Welp, the super steak burrito was about as super as Batman in that it was completely average and perfected over years of repetition.  Where were the tomatoes? Where was the sour cream? What about the beans? Was there really a point in putting three pieces of wilted lettuce in a burrito? Why was the steak so damn chewy? There aren't a ton of great values in the area for just over $7, but you'd probably expect your $7 investment to be a little more super than 5"" of burrito you can finish off in seven bites. At more than a dollar per bite, I expected something far more, well, super. Was this purchase something I have buyer's remorse about? Not really. Was the food I received on the higher end of average?

Aftercare emergency kit = Gatorade and carbohydrates. I don't DO hangovers.  Already had the gatorade, so now I needed the food. And there it was...TBP. Their burrito was greasy....but not seep through the bag greasy, so it's probably not the greasiest you'll ever encounter. It was cheap, fast (given the crowd) and most importantly...it was good!

Trust me. Their taco dinner (al pastor and carne asada) is always just what I need to get my stomach back in check after a hard night of drinking, and it's deliciously amazing every single time.  In fact, whenever my friends and I finish our night at T&B, I can't help but say how ""This was the best idea ever!""

Weather late night, or early afternoon, this place is our go-to guy in the fourth quarter, our fail-safe when we don't feel like spending $30 on a dinner at Las Mananitas.  Instead, we walk a few store fronts down, and drop $13 on a Carne Asada Fajita Burrito with avocado, two ground beef tacos, no tomatoes, with a side of chips and avacado. Avacado is nice and fresh, and a small size is efficiant for two chip-dippers. Warning: though the burrito is nice and tasty, this burrito will fall apart on you. Its a juicy one. If you eat your burritos in the foil, perhaps you will have better luck, but that's just not my thing. We keep going back to this place for a few reasons.
