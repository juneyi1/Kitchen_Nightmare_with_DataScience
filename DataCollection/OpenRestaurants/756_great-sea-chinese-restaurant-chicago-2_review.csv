They don't really fill up the carryout containers (especially when it comes to their rice), but that's just preference since I'm used to other places packing the rice to the top. If you dine in expect to wait a bit and not have the best customer service since they get really busy.  All in all, check it out and try out their wings!",-0.223,0.884,0.069,0.046,0.49166666666666664
2017-08-13,4.0,I've been hearing about Great Sea Chinese Restaurant for months. I finally got to visit on a random Friday evening.  Pros:  - They have a variety of table sizes that will accommodate various group sizes - The chicken was very delicious! Everyone comes here for the chicken lollipops so you know I had to get them.  - They have a very quick turnaround time. Even though you may wait the staff is great at making sure people get their food and finish up in a reasonable time.  - I loved the diverse set of clientele!  Cons:  -  Guaranteed wait time - this place is extremely popular so you have to be willing to wait no matter what time you visit  -  Take out took a little longer than expected but they were very sweet - I would be remiss to mention that their were a few chicken lollipops were dry inside and seemed like they used some of the chicken that had been sitting out for awhile.,0.961,0.849,0.141,0.01,0.6969949494949496

This used to be one of my go to Chinese restaurant but I steered away when I heard about the new management. Prices went up slightly and the food quality is different than before. I must say the chicken lollipop is still good here. That's probably the only thing I will come back for.

2017-07-04,2.0,"I started coming here in 2001. It was a family favorite. Last year when we heard that the ownership would change we were scared to go back to the restaurant. Our family loves the typical Korean people Chinese food: jjamppong (spicy seafood noodles soup), jjajang (black bean sauce noodles), tangsooyook (deep fried pork/beef/shrimp with clear sweet and sour sauce), kkanpoongki (spicy wings, or as many call it ""lollipop""). My husband and I managed to come here instead of going to another Chinese restaurant that we frequented after the change of management. I ordered the jjampong and he the spicy wings. I am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED with the noodles. The soup itself was so salty but when I tried the noodles, I couldn't decide if the noodle itself had too much salt in the dough or if they poured cups of salt into the water to boil it. I tried keeping face as the servers were the original servers that worked here since I came here as a child (reason why I gave 2 stars), But the  soup and the noodles were NOT edible.  Also, the rashish kimchee isn't as tasty as it used to be, as it has too much red pepper powder. Also, my husband's wings did not come out. 2 different groups of people that came after us were served and they were halfway through their food so I called the server and asked her where the food was. She returned saying that the food would take a little longer. I asked her to cancel it. She returned to the kitchen and magically appeared with the food, only to say ""what can I do? The food is ready..."" and placed it down... so my nice husband just said to let it go and ate it... unhappily. He said the wings do not taste good. It's not spicy and lacks flavor compared to before.  In the end we paid $28.16 (including tax, not too) and left very unhappy. The 2 stars are only because during the transition they kept the old waitresses that worked here for over a decade. That was very kind of the new ownership. As much as we love these ladies, we don't think we will try this restaurant again in a very long time.",0.3694,0.897,0.055,0.048,0.5120232629323539

So happy that they were bought out and the food quality is still great and it still tastes delicious. My go to orders are always the combo fried rice and the chicken lollipop wings. That sauce is perfection. You can literally eat it with anything and it would taste perfect, I even eat the sauce just like soup!  I hope this place never closes down for good because we will be running around like a headless chicken trying to find the next best thing!

2017-06-05,3.0,"I read this place was great, but I was disappointed. I did not order their signature dish of chicken wings, so maybe that was the problem. I ordered the cashew chicken, egg rolls, crab Rangoon and shrimp fried rice. The shrimp fried rice was okay, not good, very few shrimp, though they were a decent size. It was rather plain. The crab Rangoon was good, fresh cream cheese and great crab flavor. The egg rolls were the best I have had in a long time. Nice amount of meat, and not tons of cabbage. Plus you get 3, usually an order is 2, but they were generous. The cashew chicken wad mediocre at best, though it had a good amount of cashews and chicken, the sauce was just okay. I will give this place another try, but was disappointed they did not have sesame chicken on the menu. I have tried the wings, they mistakenly gave me hot when i asked for mild. The hot is very hot. Too hot for me. I eventually had the mild ones, they were good, nothing amazing about them though.

Don't get me wrong, the chicken wing lollipops are delicious although I wish the skin on them were a bit crispier, granted it must be hard to accomplish given how heavy their sauce is. I can't quite describe the sauce flavor but it's a like a combination of General Tso's and Korean pepper paste. The meat on the chicken was pretty tender and plentiful.  But the dish I was really surprised by was the jjajangmyun (noodles w/ black bean sauce). Maybe it's cause I hadn't had a good one in a while, but it totally hit the spot for me. The sauce wasn't too sweet (#1 mistake most places make) and had great depth to the flavor. The hot sauce they also provide was really really good. Watch out because it does pack a punch.  The one dish I hated was the mapo tofu. It was on par with mapo tofu that you get at a Chinese takeout place (which is never good). It wasn't spicy (adding the hot sauce helped) and it tasted bland. Don't get this here. The dumplings here were also very generic. I'm 95% sure they are just store-bought dumplings that you keep in the freezer.

Don't come here unless you want to be unappreciated and treated like dirt. A tip isn't a guarantee unless you give good service    Keep in mind that they didn't even deserve a tip in the first place. The food was ok at best. The second time i went with my boyfriend thinking maybe they had changed their attitude and the food got better since they still got good reviews on here. NOPE very disappointed!!!! The waitress was even ruder than the last she basically dropped our food on the table and walked away. I was very angry but my boyfriend is very nice so i didn't walk out. We did not enjoy our food. My boyfriend got the Mongolian beef and i got the orange chicken lunch Specials.  It was very bland and mine wasn't even hot the rice was cold!! But anyways we get the check and pay and YOU STILL CAN'T PAY ON YOUR CREDIT CARD. My boyfriend and i have bad luck carrying cash so we just get up and leave they don't deserve a tip anyways. I realize that i forget my sunglasses so my boyfriend goes back for them and they harass him for a tip!!

2016-05-01,5.0,"FAMOUS FOR - GGampoongi (Spicy Chicken Wings) (10/10) BUZZ - Jjajangmyun (Black Bean Noodles) (8/10) I ALSO TRIED - Kkakdoogi (Spicy Pickled Radish Cubes) (10/10) - Par Bo Chae (Happy Family Seafood Delight?) (9/10) Little history lesson. Lawrence Ave. was straight up Korea Town in the 70's through about 2000. There were restaurants, laundromats, tailors, plumbers, bakeries, salons, barbers, travel agents, real estate agents, insurance agents, pharmacies, gift shops, grocery stores, and everything in between, all owned and operated by hard working Korean immigrants.  The majority of the Korean immigrants arrived in the 70's with very little money, because the Korean government restricted how much cash they could take. You could take enough for a nice vacation, but not really enough to start a living. Many of these families were wealthy in Korea either because of political status or professions that require higher education, like doctors, pharmacists, lawyers, etc.; however, due to credentials not transferring and the language barrier, many were forced to leave their professions behind, and take up a trade, like cooking, for instance. They all set up stores right along Lawrence Ave. and if you were Korean, no matter whether you lived in the burbs or in the city, when you needed anything Korean, you went to Lawrence! Just a little after 2000, there was a great exodus from Lawrence Ave to the burbs (i.e. Glenview, Northbrook, etc.). Mainly, this was because all successfully raised their families and made enough money to retire, or they had kids that were about to go to high school and wanted them to go to the best ones. This unfortunately left a big hole in the Korean Restaurant scene in Chicago. Very few if any restaurants that popped up in the burbs (the new Korea Town) can match what we used to have on Lawrence.  I tell you this story, because this is one of the only old school K-Town restaurants that, despite that great exodus, still exists today! GGAMPOONGI Since I spent so many characters on the intro, I'm gonna have to keep this short. THIS, my friends, is what keeps us coming back for 30 years! Our family ate here almost every weekend when we ran Korean errands, and after getting my license, I'd make the trip to Chicago to get this every now and then with friends.  These are bone in chicken thighs/legs, but they're very small. 2-3 bites (or 1 big bite) and you can leave nothing but the bone. The meat is like Chicken McNugget moist and tender! Little bit of deep fried batter, which mainly acts like a sponge to contain the 8th wonder of the world, which is their sauce. It's a salty, sweet, spicy sauce consisting of soy, ginger, garlic, chili pepper, and sweetness. If you ask for ""extra spicy"" today, you get the level of spice that used to be on these wings back in the day, but I think now, in order to market better to non-Koreans, their standard level is a very mild blend, which I think sucks. I don't call this ""selling out,"" though, because if their clientele was based solely on Korean patrons, this place wouldn't have survived the exodus.  When you get extra spicy, or if your tolerance isn't high, this dish defines masochism. The wings are so hot and juicy, and the sauce is so unbelievably delicious, you can't help but eat more (and drink more water). You start sweating, your nose starts to run, your scalp gets so itchy, but instead of stopping, you bury your tongue in hot rice to scald away the heat, which is almost painful enough to make you faint, but for some reason, the wires cross in your brain, and the burning, piercing sensations register as pleasure as opposed to excruciating pain....and then you go for another. KKAKDOOGI This is another locked away treasure that this place holds. Their kkakdoogi, which is basically spicy pickled radish, is so unique, I could pick them out in a blind taste test for sure. If you know anything about Korean food culture, kimchi (or kkakdoogi too) is a family recipe, kind of like tamales to Mexicans or meatloaf to Americans. Their cubes have a soft outer 1 mm layer, but the inside still remains crunchy, but all the flavors are infused throughout. They have an innate sweetness to them too, which is difficult to do. These are so good, I can happily (and I have before), eat just this and rice. Here's why it's so impressive. Radish is super crunchy and has a taste of its own. The spicy/pickling agent obviously has a flavor of its own, and we want this to taste like the pickling with only a little bit of original bitter radish flavor. So you need time. The longer you soak, the more flavors you infuse into the radish, but then you lose crunchiness. I've had kkakdoogi that tasted as infused as these, but then it lost all of it crunchiness - like a bruised apple. But Great Seas' kkakdoogi somehow maintains most of its crunchiness while tasting like it's been pickling for months. Don't know how they do it! NO SPACE More to say, but no room.

The black bean noodle and spicy seafood soup were okay. However, the spicy chicken wings  weren't as good as usual and tasted like reheated leftovers. The service is what brought it down to 1:  During dinner-  We were one of two tables on this empty Friday night. Service was mediocre and we constantly had to ask for more water.  After dinner- After we had left to go to the graduation, my mom remembered she never got her credit card back. We called the restaurant to see if they had it.. and the lady we spoke to already seemed pretty pissed about it. We asked what time they were open until, but by that time, she had already hung up on us. Thinking it's not a big deal, we looked up their hours on yelp. It says they are open until 10:30 on Friday so we decided to head over and pick it up on the way home from graduation. Knowing we might make it there by 10:20-30, we called and let them know we would be there as soon as possible. The same rude lady yelled at us asking who put 10:30 on yelp when they close at 10 PM and are getting ready to leave. She told us to come the next day (We live about an hour away and at this point we were about 10 minutes away). Again, we politely stated we were almost there and apologized for the inconvenience (Not sure why we apologized when they were the ones that never gave us our credit card back). All she says is ""Oh my God"" and hangs up on us. Now for the BEST part- We got there only to realize there were still customers eating!! They weren't closing up and ""ready to leave"". The lady hands us the card and sharply let us know they couldn't close up cause they were waiting for us.

These dishes bring fond memories of visiting South Korea and in Korea they deliver these meals in proper plates, bowls and dishes and when you are done you just leave it outside you house and they pick it up.  (Crazy I Know!)   At Great Seas, We order family style and share. Some of our must order foods are the  Tangsuyuk (sweet and sour crisy pork, this is not your usually sweet and sour dish as its a bit brighter and lighter),  JJampong (spicy seafood noodle sou),  Lollipop Chicken Wings (we only get it Korean Spicy style) And to finish we get jjajangmyeon (black noodles).   The only other places that I know that serve this style food is Yu's in Schaumburg and a wack version at H-Mart.  A few tips are that they take credit card, but only do cash tips, which means it is always a good idea to bring a few bucks to tip the servers.  Also, they sell the sauce in bottles for the Chicken Wings, so you can use it at home.",0.9889,0.827,0.155,0.018,0.5577160493827159

We ordered the wings ($15.95) for takeout, and there was only a ten-minute wait time. One can choose from three spice levels. I opted for medium spice, which is a balance of sweet and heat. The wings come with a takeout container of white rice.  I reheated the wings and rice for dinner that evening (350 degrees for 15 minutes), and the girls and I finished the wings in minutes.

Was rude from the time I sat down and acted like she was mad. Maybe she had a bad day with someone else that looked like me, I donno. Maybe other guys before me didn't leave her any tip.  Ordered spicy chicken wings and black bean noodles. The server lady didn't bring out the standard sides that comes with this item. Since she never came back to check on the table, I went up to the counter to ask for it. I was kind and courteous like I always am. Afterwards they brought me the check. It didn't have a tip section, so I drew my own line and added the tip. Another lady who brought the check to me looked at the receipt, then asked me if I had cash instead (in Korean).  I said no, sorry I don't have cash (I already checked my pockets). She then restated that they only take cash for tip.  So I said, well, I have cash in my car... At this time the first server (who acted like she was mad at me) joined the table, so figuring they can work it out themselves, I just walked out.   Based on the service I got, it would have been justified to not leave a tip and never come back. I am a very easy customer. I rarely ask for anything. If I can get it myself, I do it myself (whether it's napkins or to-go boxes). But I decided to do my part by giving a decent tip--in hope that maybe the server will feel better. So you heard it here. They don't want tips unless it's in cash. As a side note, this is my first time here at ""Korea Town"". But in reality, objectively speaking, it should be Mexico Town. 6 of 10 businesses are Mexican, and the people walking on the sidewalk are mostly of Latin decent.  Customers were mostly Mexican/Hispanic as well during my 40-min lunch.

We got there near the end of the Dad's day dinner rush and didn't have to wait too long too be seated.  The waitresses seemed a little overwhelmed and it take some effort to get noticed. The decor is fairly typical for a Chinese place, and hasn't changed in years.  The front area is a little jungle-like with their corn plants.  The day we came it was pretty packed and quite warm inside.  Things were a little disorganized but they did their best. We ordered the gampong (hot & spicy) shrimp which is basically a plate of shrimp battered, fried, and drenched in the same sauce as the wings.  For about $1-$1.50 more than the chicken you get a whole pile of shrimp.  Totally worth it.  Be sure to eat it all there though as it definitely does not taste as good the next day.  We also ordered the beef with snow peas and the chicken chow mein.  Both were good, the chow mein was more look like la mein in that it was more saucy and soft/al dente than the usual dry/fried yellow noodles.  Different but still delicious.  Dinner came with some free sides of the kimchi pickled radishes and onion with the sweet black sauce, typical of a Chinese/Korean restaurant. This place is definitely known for their wings, and we may have been the only table at the restaurant that didn't order wings, but their other dishes have also proven to be pretty good and reasonably priced.

However, we also ordered the egg drop soup (good, but unexceptional) and salt and pepper pork. I actually didn't like the salt and pepper pork at all, because the sauce was weirdly applied to the meat - some pieces of meat were dripping in sauce, while others were pretty dry. They were also covered in some pretty generic vegetables, which I think it could have gone without.  The rice was dry and typical of take-out rice, not a sit-down restaurant, but I was still pretty grateful for it once the spiciness of the chicken hit me.  Service was okay. I went with a Korean friend who was able to speak to the waitress, which I appreciated. They were not very timely with refilling our water glasses, and they definitely didn't give us enough napkins for the wings, but they were happy to do both once we pointed it out.

We arrived around 9pm, and their relatively small dining room was ~1/3 full. Service was courteous and quick, they refilled waters and attended to us promptly. Food came in a flash. Their famous wings were pretty good. $14.99 is not cheap (for that price I'd go to Crisp any day) for ~10-12 drummettes, and sauce is really nothing anyone can't make at home, but they were piping hot, crispy, and juicy and pretty delicious. The spiciness is more of an afterwards burning sensation rather than bold flavored fresh chilies, and it's not too bad of a kick.  The good stops there though.  We also ordered jjajangmyeon, spring rolls, and egg drop soup. I think I'm biased against Korean jjajangmyeon in favor of meaty Chinese zha jiang mian in general, but this was a little bland and boring. The noodles they use had a really great chewy consistency when fresh though. The spring rolls were bad - dry exterior of a saltine cracker and a really dry filling.  The 2-people minimum portion of egg drop soup probably fills 3 of the bowls they give you, so 3 or 4 people can easily share that order. Unfortunately, on our visit the soup contained notes of an odor resembling... well, those Callery pear trees that bloom in spring around Chicago.

Get extra rice so you can put the sauce on the rice and eat till you're full. They're everything that the reviewers have said (well at least all the good things. If you have something bad to say about these, kindly die in a sports riot). Jjamppong - I have no idea what it's actually called on the menu, I just order this. It's basically a spicy seafood stew with noodles. I get it whenever I'm sick and I also order it when I'm feeling fine. Jjajjang myun - These are Korean black bean paste noodles.

Place had a cozy, Chinese restaurant vibe and all I could smell and see at every single table are those spicy and hot chicken wings that every review also seems to talk about so I knew that those were definitely on the list. Right when we sat down a nice lady brought us Ooolang tea which my grandpa seemed to really enjoy throughout the meal. Here is what we got and my thoughts on it. -Crab Ragoons-Huge portion, 6 of them for $4.99 but they were kinda blah, wouldn't get them again. Over crispy, only cream cheese inside, didn't even smell like crab, but still huge.  -Egg rolls-4 baby spring rolls and they were also just eh, I have definitely experienced better, so wouldn't get these again either. -Kung Pao Shrimp-Decent portion for $14.99, lots of big shrimp and veggies in a hot and sweet sauce. I didn't have any but my hubby thought the shrimp tasted a little too fishy like they were just out of the ocean, so I'm happy I didn't have any. Too fishy should be my sushi, not my kung pao shrimp that is fully cooked. -THE chicken wings-We ordered them medium since too spicy would have been too much for all of us. For $15 you get 15 wings which is a little pricey in my opinion but since this is their signature dish people will pay up for them. I thought they were just okay, I've definitely experienced similar ones at Buffalo Wild wings, not necessarily same shape, but same flavor for a lot cheaper. Also, the best chicken wings in the city belong to Crisp! Sorry Great Sea.

No, what people are there for is the food, specifically the spicy, drumstick-style wings, which are as deliciously addictive as promised by the hundreds of Yelp reviews below mine.  We also ordered egg rolls (greasy, meaty, tasty) and the Kung Pao beef, which came to the table fresh, hot and also quite spicy.  If you've got a taste for classic, American-style Chinese food, this place will not disappoint. They were only accepting cash payments on the night we were there, but we'd been forewarned that at the very least, tips had to be left in cash, so it wasn't an issue.",0.9737,0.831,0.141,0.028,0.48058823529411776

2013-02-02,4.0,"If you enjoy feeling like you're eating inside a shoebox with at least 20 other people in there with you, then by all means, eat at Great Sea Chinese Restaurant!  Don't get me wrong, their wings are excellent! So was the spicy Tofu dish I consumed. Korean/Chinese fusion restaurants are really where it's at! That is, if you like comfort food.  The wings seem like the meat is beaten with a meat tenderizer while the meat is still on the bone, then breaded and deep fried. After that's done, the wings are then basted in a sauce. I got their spiciest/hottest wings they had to offer, be prepared. Otherwise, they do offer a less spicy sauce. It is basically a teryaki type flavor, amped up with a kick. The tofu was excellent because it was drowned in a spicy gravy with chopped veggies. I am usually put off by tofu. I don't like the texture. This spicy gravy it was in, plus the fact that you put it over white rice, was what blended the texture into a dish I will definitely come back for. I have been to nice Chinese places in the past. Most of them have offered moist wipes in order to clean your hands off after a meal. With the wings, this place needs to offer this service. The wing sauce gets all over your hands. You can't get the sticky feeling off of your fingers with a dry napkin. If you're having other dishes with the wings, this presents a bit of a problem. Especially if you're on a first date and you're trying to prove that you weren't raised in a barn. I was unable to get my hands clean to the point where I wanted to use utensils in order to consume the tofu dish. Instead, I had to take my napkin, and dip it into my glass of water in order to clean off my hands. If I was trying to make a first impression on a man, I'm sure that would have put me in the ""no fly"" zone. GSCR really needs to start offering moist wipes with the wings. Or perhaps in general. If they do have them, they weren't offered to me. I walked into GSCR, and right away I got the sense that the business is all about family. I love Asian culture for this fact alone. There is so much loyalty that seems to sweep through the staff. I'm sure there are bad days, but the mutual respect looks like it's there. I enjoyed watching one of the kids of a staff member hand out menus and deliver the checks to the tables. It just made the environment that much more inviting in an area of the city that seems to have fallen into the hands of a new crowd. The newbies don't understand how to respect what it is they have. This old Korean town has declined in the quality of people who live there over the years. It's a shame too. GSCR is a shining light in the center of ugly. I appreciate that. It gives me hope that my neighborhood will soon grow back its strength as a bustling community.  The restaurant is decorated with lots of colors and patterns on the walls. The table settings are even festive, with the classic place mats, which help you learn about your Chinese Astrology sign. I could describe better than that, but I waited too long after my experience there to remember what it looks like exactly. I also think it's cute how you walk in and right away you see photos of people of all cultures who have come in just for the wings, and they hold signs showing how many they were able to consume in one sitting. Customer appreciation is huge! I love it, even if it does feel cheesy. The photos aren't spoiling the look and feel of the rest of the restaurant. Take a friend here for lunch, or perhaps this is a cute first date outing. I went around lunch time, and the place was very busy. I don't know how it is at night. Whatever the case, wear comfortable, yet presentable clothing. Most importantly, be hungry! There's lots of food that comes with an order.

Service is standard to poor and sanity has been a major concern at times but I keep coming back because of the spicy chicken wings. This place is well known in the Chicago Asian community for having the best wings in the city. In fact, I have yet to come across something similar in other cities but there are plenty of impersonators in Chicagoland, the closest being right down the street. Sweet, spicy, sticky goodness has rocketed the popularity of the wings to fame. A corkboard in the entry way shows pictures of people who have accomplished disgusting record numbers of wing consumption.  You can't just order wings when you come here or else you'll want for something more so I order the mapo tofu which is a spicy tofu concoction that includes peas and bits of pork with a spicy sauce. I laddle this tofu mix over some rice, grab a wing with my left hand and shovel the rice with my right hand in to my belly for a fiery combination. Sadly, the neighborhood has gone to absolute hell and it shows inside the restaurant as well. They haven't ever updated the interior in the 20 plus years that I remember coming here and it really shows. It's a dirty hole in the wall joint in an even dirtier and dangerous gang infested neighborhood with a New York-like lack of parking.

Great Seas is one of the last standing great Chinese-Korean restaurants in Chicago with the best ggang poong gi that hasn't changed in over a decade. On their menu, it's called Hot and Spicy Chicken Wings and it's the dish to get when you're there. They made it easy for you to order so that you don't have to try attempting the Korean pronunciation. Almost everyone eating around us had an order on their table. The legs are pushed to the top and then deep fried so that when they are done, they look like giant lollipops. Delicious hot deep fried chicken wings smothered with a sweet and spicy sauce with chilies and garlic. The sauce has big bold flavor - just spoon the sauce over rice and you are good to go. One order comes with a lot of food which I definitely appreciate.  I was also particularly surprised to see how diverse the customers were. I appreciate that they have not secluded themselves like many other ethnic restaurants that only cater to their community. Instead, all of the workers spoke English and it was clear that people felt welcomed there. There are plenty of other places that have attempted to recreate their version of ggang poong gi. Call it spicy garlic chicken or hot and spicy chicken wings but the bottom line is that Great Seas still has one of the best ggang poong gi in Chicago. Take it from someone who has been eating ggang poong gi for over 15 years around Chicago well before it was ever called anything else.",0.9725,0.839,0.133,0.027,0.6274193548387097

A lollipop chicken wing. But why do people love Great Sea? Is it just cuz they dish out some funky looking wings? No. Not just that. It's because the why they are fried, which is to perfection. But on top of that, it's all about the sauce. Oh my goodness. Let's talk sauce. Start off at the bottom of the spice chain and work your way up. It's extraordinary. And even more, they sell their sauce in bottles. That's how legit this stuff is, my fellow Yelpers. One order of these lollipop wings will be good for one to two people.

It was like I was insulting the staff by asking for water! In the last year, the service has gotten much better (they now refill my water without asking, and smiles appear also).

Great Sea's chicken wings are the best Asian wings I have had period. The portions are bigger than average and crisp is just perfect but the one thing that absolutely stands out is the sauce. It's one of those sauces I can drizzle over rice and eat plain.  The only reason I don't give this place a five is because the wings are that good, almost every other dish is mediocre in comparison. The crab rangoon was subpar and the hot and sour soup and salt and pepper smelt were adequate.

We were welcomed with friendly service and a cozy dining room. Just about every table was taken, but you didn't get the same feel you would at any other busy restaurant. This place was much calmer. Our Uptown hosts put in an order for 2 plates of 15 'hot and saucy' wings. The plates came in, piled high with a good helping of sauce underneath them.  Thanks Great Seas, for giving us 33 'wings' in total. High five for being so generous! 'Wings...' I'm not exactly sure what part of the chicken we were eating, but man, were they good. Every table around us had at least one plate of these wings, and I'm pretty sure the 15 boxes of carry out on their counter were filled with them as well. The bill came out to $26 for the four of us.

2010-12-11,3.0,"This is the second time I've been to Great Sea Chinese Restaurant, and both times the food has been decent. I'm giving it a three-star rating because I was a little disappointed with the food I ordered the last time I went there. I ventured a bit outside of the standard Chinese restaurant staples, which is my fault, but I was hoping that by being a little experimental, I would find something I really liked. Unfortunately, that was not the case. I ordered the Shrimp and Scallop, and I was really disappointed. I used to love this Shrimp and Scallop dish from a Chinese place that's located all the way in Roselle. I was hoping to find something similar at Great Sea Chinese since it's so much closer to home, but I did not. The shrimp tasted good, but the scallops were somewhat bitter and rubbery. The dish also came with mushrooms, which I generally love, but I really didn't care for them in this case. The whole dish had sort of a slimy texture to it that was unappealing.  My meal was fortunately saved by everything else we ordered. For an appetizer we had the Crab Rangoon, which were pretty tasty, though a bit oily. The Chicken Fried Rice had a nice, unique flavor to it, and the Korean-style Chicken Wings were also very crispy and delicious.  Before we left, we were actually going to order Mongolian Beef to go, but it took forever for a server to come back to our table. After our entrees were dropped off at our table, no one came to check on us until 15 minutes after we had finished eating. We ended up not ordering the Mongolian Beef just because we didn't feel like waiting around any longer.  Where the service lacked in attentiveness, it partially made up for in the speed in which our leftovers were packaged. I know it may not seem like a big deal, but I hate it when you have to pack your own food--especially at a Chinese restaurant since it can get messy. The man who packed our food did it so quickly and effortlessly--I was really impressed!  I'll go back to Great Sea Chinese Restaurant. I think it's a good value for the price. The service is minimal but OK, and, overall, the food is tasty. I just have to remember to stick with the basic staples when I order!",0.9936,0.758,0.166,0.076,0.4584876543209877

So I haven't had much time to explore my beloved Chicago and its seductive bounty of restaurants. Alas, until my friend nearly dragged me out of my paper/book hole to try these wings that he said were worth a break from homework. 3 dishes, 1 drink: - the WINGS - black noodles (noodles in black bean sauce) - wonton soup - mango banana smoothie Fruit Smoothie First off, I hadn't had a fruit smoothie in three months, so I might be biased in saying that that smoothie was really good. Then again, mango + banana is a great combination. No bubbles to go with it though, but I'm not the biggest boba fan. Wonton Soup Perfect for a cold day! I really liked Great Sea's soup! It seemed manageable versus the Chinese restaurants that give you big, honking wontons that you bite into, then plop into your soup and all over your shirt. No, these wontons were slightly deconstructed with a good mix of cabbage. Delicious. Black Noodles Black from black beans, not because they emerged from Mordor. I also enjoyed these because they're unusual and I've never seen another restaurant serve these before. Black beans are also healthy (that's what I tell myself). One of the multiple servers nicely came by with a pair of clean scissors and cut the noodles for us so that they were easier to plate.  Wings We went with the medium spicy and they were good, but not necessarily memorable for me. I guess I was expecting something more along the lines of Crisp. I did, however, appreciate that they were my first experience with ""lollipopped"" wings (drumstick meat pushed to the end to form a meat lollipop. Mmm...) Perhaps I need to go back and go with a more spicy sauce. You can also buy jars of the sauce at the bar. I know some people have developed sauce substance abuse, so they are appropriately located in the restaurant. Ambiance & Service Great service, busy place! Don't be surprised if you have multiple servers and if you are approached to sit communally at a large dining table (which is what we did).  Price SOOOO cheap for the amount of food you get!

The owner said they haven't change the price of the jjajjangmyun for 10 years which makes this dish not so bad.  Two things you might want to prepare for:  1. The credit card charge. Great Seas charges the credit card minimum of $20. Our bill came out to be about $18, but I didn't think it was a big deal due to my satisfied stomach.

2010-08-14,5.0,"The wings here, are the best if you're looking for Korean style Ggam poong gi. Make sure you get the spicy one or else you're not getting the full effect of the wings. Not only are the wings good, but the sauce is amazing to mix with your rice to eat together. Although slightly pricey, a group of four can dine for about $15 bucks a person. Honestly, the wings alone are good enough to eat forever, but if you want some other flavors, the mapo tofu is delicious as well as their mongolian beef. The jjajjangmyun is above average but nothing to rave about. The restaurant space is small, but I've never had to wait too long for a table. A can't miss place to eat on the north side of Chicago.

2010-08-14,4.0,"This Korean owned Chinese joint serves many of your westernized standards like Mongolian Beef and Orange Chicken, but in the end it's all about the wings.  The wings have a nice crisp exterior (but sometimes my fiancee finds them a little too tough) before getting a nice bath in an addicting sweet and spicy sauce, which you can actually buy by the jar.  The chicken lollipop descriptors are pretty much on point and it's way too easy to keep eating these things before noticing that the button on your jeans has already popped off.  If you're not in a poultry sort of mood, you can also do an order of fried shrimp in the same sauce.  For you wannabe competitive eaters out there about 90 wings (approximately 6 orders by my count) will get your mug shot in the foyer's wall of fame.   So to recap...

2010-08-08,2.0,I've been here many times many years ago but haven't frequented the place for a while. I just went over the weekend for lunch and I have to say the quality has diminished. The chicken wings are probably one of the best but I remember them being THE best but they just don't taste like they used to. The black bean noodles (jajangmyun) isn't as good as VIP Chinese on Montrose and that goes for the spicy seafood soup (jampong) as well. At VIP they actually have a dish made up of both the black bean noodles and the spicy seafood soup in one bowl that has two sections so there are two compartments in one bowl to separate out the two dishes and both are far better than Great Sea's. Also the Mongolian beef was so-so. I'll probably just go to VIP next time.,0.991,0.738,0.229,0.033,0.4547619047619048

These asian style wings with the giant hunks of meat in that sweet and spicy sauce make me already want to plan my next trip to Chi-town while still eating them! I get the jjajjangmyun vegetarian and gan-jjajjang style. This just means they bring the sauce out in a bowl separate from the noodles. I'm obviously not a vegetarian, but for some reason I always like my jjajjangmyun without the meat flavor, and something about having the sauce come out in a separate bowl just makes it taste better. Maybe it's just because I've been eating it that way since I was a little kid, but regardless, I like it that way.

2010-05-08,4.0,"And thus the Holy Trinity of chicken wings was complete. What happens when you turn the two parts of the wing into one giant meaty lollipop and double fry it for extra crispiness and dip it into General Tso's Chicken sauce?  After dodging growling panhandlers on the deep south side at Wings Around the World and watching ice cream workers get hazed post-wings after Crisp it was time to make my inaugural appearance at Great Seas Chinese Restaurant. Great Seas is in the heart of Albany Park off the end of the Kimball Brown Line CTA (yes, I am the mayor!). My foodies friends have always recommended Great Seas, but sometimes you just can't go by yourself. That's what friends are for and I had eleven fellow guinea pigs to come along for the wild adventure! Trying to be a conscientious host, I called a week in advance to make reservations for ten. The manager told me that they don't normally take reservations for the weekend, but made an exception and took down my info. Showing up on time for a big lunch usually means that people will have to wait, so I made sure to get to the Great Seas twenty minutes early and came just in time to see a party of ten clear out. After this, the servers came in like NASCAR disposing of the evidence and setting up anew and I sat myself down once they were done.  In came the Yelpers and the party was ready to begin. My first instinct was to go try to house 2 orders of wings on my own but discretion proved the better part of honor as our resident Yelp CM took over ordering responsibilities and picked 4 chicken wing orders, 1 order of spicy cuttle fish, 2 orders of crab rangoon, 1 black noodle, and one giant order of egg drop soup to get the party started! The servers summoned tea, dropped down a pitcher of water and the lazy susan was spinning round and round like a carousel in no time. There was room and I didn't hit elbows with anyone or struggle for room. I even had enough room to keep my backpack under the table. There were families and people on dates and one old lady with a fuzzy hat chowing down. Finally our food ARRIVED! ****Spicy Cuttlefish**** Hoooo eeeeeeeeeee! This thing was laced with fireballs and plenty of specks of pepper galore marked its path. To play with this cuttlefish was to dance a dance of death as taste buds died from the oppressive heat of the cuttlefish. Mixed with rice, the spiciness subsided and made for good eating as the texture of the cuttlefish was delightful to the tongue and there were plenty of veggies for the health nuts in the party.  ****Egg Drop Soup**** While others in the group commented that it wasn't too salty, I prefer my soups very salty and very hot! The soup was warm but I ended up eating the heck out of my soup quickly since it wasn't hot and piping when it arrived. Good texture of egg and the soup was very yellow. I prefer the whites a little more hardened in my egg drop but the soup was good enough to feed the dozen of us at the table! ****Crab Rangoon**** Underwhelming, I'd have to say. While high on the crisp factor (just the way I like it), the stuffing was a bit too dense and not spread out enough. Also the stuffing had only the oil flavor and lacked any special oomph that I have marked in other crab rangoon. Still decent, but lacks the great nomnomnom factor that leaves you grabbing the next piece without fear of engulfing the whole thing. ****Black Noodle**** I had heard from many that this was a go-to sort of dish. Down came black noodle and it looked like a giant pile of goo. Remember that episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation when Lieutenant Yar get pwned by the black tar goo? That's completely what this black noodle looked like! The server let us know that we had to mash it up before it all stuck together which threw me off, but once she mixed it up for us, the black noodle looked like chow mein noodles with the black sauce which was absorbed rendering the noodle brown. Delicious with smooth texture it was a comfy snack to have on our way to the main event. ****Hot n' Spicy Chicken Wings**** Like Michael's Jackson's last stand: This is IT!  Welcome to Great Seas Chinese Restaurant 101, these are the bestest chicken wings on all of the north side. Challenge and appeal all you'd like but all applications would be red stamped DENIED in the face of these beasts.  I was not only owned, but I was pwned! It was hot out the kitchen, it was c-r-i-s-p and begging to be eaten again and again and again. There's nothing like watching four plates of chicken wings vanish into nothingness and having to call in reinforcements. I don't know how they manufacture this special lollipopped chicken wing, but they had ALL of the meat all on one piece of bone! Imagine a perfect world: chicken wing meat on the bone without having to bite and chew around crazed edges and ripping off pieces to get more meat. What you saw was what you got and all of the wing was there.  In the end it cost of all of $12 apiece between 12 people! GO NOW!",0.9987,0.814,0.143,0.043,0.543787657920311

They are fried, then covered with a sweet and spicy savory sauce. Great Sea's wings have their meat pushed to the ends like a chicken lollipop. The fried shrimp with the same sauce is also delicious. These dishes come out so piping fresh straight from the kitchen!  You may wonder what the two side dishes that come out before your meal are. They are onions with black bean dipping sauce (honestly never appealed to me, but old asian dads eat them haha), and ""ggak doo gee"" which is spicy korean pickled radish that is like kimchi (radish instead of cabbage). You eat the onion/black bean as more of an appetizer (again, not appealing to me). And the korean radish as a side dish (YUM).  This is classic Korean-Chinese food (fusion food Chinese immigrants to Korea created back in the day). Typically, you order a noodle dish and these wings.  There are 2 classic noodle options every Korean will order. 1. Jja jjiang mein- Noodles with Black bean based sauce with onions, pork, zucchini.  2.

For starters they give you a plate of onions to dip into delicious black bean curd, super authentic. The noodles we ordered were amazing and the sauce was delicious. What they're known for though is their chicken wings..........and for real, they are probably the best wings I've eaten.  People seem to complain about the service being slow and the people being pushy but I didn't get that vibe at all.

Funny thing is that it's owned by Koreans. So, everyone mentions the wings here and they even have the pictures of all the people that try to break the eating record for that. I do like the wings... A LOT.. this makes up for the sometimes lousy service they give.. My mom doesn't eat spicy, but she can eat some of the wings here so they aren't too spicy (even when I've requested them super spicy.) The ma po tofu they make is quite spicy however.. Quite delicious too!  What my mom does eat and what gives me the fondest memories is the cha chiang mein. It's just noodles with black bean sauce or something. We first ordered it when my mom saw it and pointed directly at a couple eating it asking the waitress what that was and asking for an order of it. Ever since, she's always had to order it when we go. Also, much to the amusement of my family and I, there was a waitress there that always seemed to wait on us (mostly me) because she liked me. Quite amusing.. Now they do cut the noodles for you usually and mix it, but this lady cut it and mixed it and even got us more sauce. It was funny to always have all my water filled too.. I miss her... such great service back then..  ANYWAYS, this place is one where you go for the food.

Seriously, this shit is fucking hot. It comes out at some kind of white-hot volcano temperature out of the fryer or something AND it assaults you with like five kinds of spiciness that I don't even know how to identify.

So if you think Generol Tso's and Kung Pao is real Chinese, then you're in for a very big surprise. Those are Americanized Chinese dishes.  The wings, properly called Kan Pun Gi, are the specialty at this joint. They are succulent, hot, spicy, sweet, savory, and slightly crispy on the outside generally. They are drenched in their special magical sauce so sometimes the crisp is just barely there. They push up the chicken to one end so that they resemble a lollipop. Very...very...good. Now they are not the best wings I ever had, but the best I've had in Chicago.  Their other dishes I have tried are very good as well.

So you should probably adjust your expectations.] As all of the other reviews mention, the prize dish here is the spicy wings (ggang-poon-gi).

It's accomodating to couples, families, as well as large groups, which is nice considering it's a relatively small place.

Yeah, I guess I missed the hall of fame photos on the way in. I thought the price was a little steep for just some chicken wangs, but damn it was definitely worth it as these were not just some ordinary fried chicken wings. The order was pretty large about 15 wings, which allowed me to share but whoa I never knew such wings existed!! The sauce is spicy sweet and tangy and the wings come in these lollipop configurations, very convenient for eating while driving. I don't know if the bottled sauce they sell there is the same sauce but if it is, I want to just reheat it and drink it as a hot beverage. It's just seriously that friggin' good but just be careful, I think the sauce has some addictive properties and it should probably be DEA classified.",0.9711,0.791,0.15,0.059,0.6520382395382396

They've been opened for over 20 years, and I am grateful that they are still around. My folks grew up eating Shang Dong style Korean-Chinese food and introduced it to my brother and I at an early age.  First, their kam pung gi (spicy chicken wings) are the best. They are frenched wings with the meat pushed to one end, double fried, and covered in a spicy, sweet, soy-saucy, garlicky goodness that makes me happy to be alive.  Second, their Cha Jiang Mein (ja jiang myun) black noodles are arguably the best in town (Great Bejing is a close 2nd). You must order the Saam Sun Gun Cha Jiang, because they make the sauce with meat and seafood, and serve it on the side. It's the BOMB!  Third, their Chaam Pohng (sp?) - spicy seafood noodle soup is a deliciousness I cannot tell you about. It is huge, so bring a date and your appetites.  The decor isn't anything to write home about, and I'm not sure much has changed in the past 20 years except for a few minor changes. But I don't go there for the decor. The food keeps me coming back. The service can be hit or miss. You just have to get good at flagging the waitstaff (which I actually like because I don't like being incessantly bothered when I'm stuffing my face full of wings) down.

Our meal consisted of the appetizer sampler, an order of wings, a strawberry-banana smoothie and a coke, which totaled up to $31.  Since we were unable to decide on which two appetizers to choose, we decided to roll the dice and go with the sampler, which is huge and consists of Shrimp Rolls, Spring Rolls, Egg Rolls, Crab Rangoon, a few wings (w/o sauce) and a few more items. Definitely worth the money for a large group. If you go to Great Sea without ordering the wings, you have truly missed out. They are crunchy and the sauce is great.

Last time I went, we ordered the ggampungi (chicken wings) and I was impressed.  The spicy order was delicious and had a nice kick.  I wish I had read the Yelp review about being able to take the sauce home, because I'd be bathing in it right now... mmmmm.....   The ggampungi is actually more expensive than the noodles, but I've never been this stuffed for $15, including tax and tip.  Seriously, I felt like Octomom with 8 food babies in tow.

Additionally, the service was horrible, on par with Cho Sun Ok and other Korean restaurants of its ilk.  The waitresses treated us like crap, probably because we weren't Korean.  They were extremely slow and unattentive, and when they did come around they were rude.  The place was dirty, dingy and dark. Honestly, we can't fathom why people come here.  Save some money, gas, time and stomach and go somewhere else.  Don't waste your life here, guys.  Seriously.  If you want some authentic Chinese food, go to Lao Szechuan in Chinatown.  If you want good Korean barbecue, go to Cho Sun Ok (awesome despite its shitty service).",0.9744,0.758,0.166,0.076,0.5818452380952381

To be clear, Great Sea is listed as a Chinese / Korean restaurant, but don't go expecting Korean food, unless maybe you can speak Korean. It's *Korean-Owned*, serving Chinese food.  We went there after looking at Yelp because my friends wanted some good Korean food. The menus we were handed had only Chinese items on it. My wife even asked the waitress, ""Do you have a Korean menu?"", so the waitress pointed out the Korean translations of the Chinese printed next to the items on the menu.... But, as far as we were able to ascertain, no Korean food. (none that we were able to read, anyway...)  Oh well. A few minutes later I saw that the table next to us got a completely different-looking menu. Ours was text-only (no descriptions of the dishes, incidentally, so I hope you know what you like), but next to us, the people had menus with lovely little color pictures of the food. Hmm, either they expected us to be literate, or they didn't have enough of the deluxe menus, or something. Odd. All that aside, after we ordered our Chinese food, nearly all of it was good, meaning above average for Chicago Chinese food. The very bland Fried Rice aside, we had the Ginger Beef and the 3 Sea Spicy Noodle soup, and the Red Noodle Soup, and the aforementioned chicken wings.  Based on our experience, we'd definitely go back for take-out, definitely get more Chicken wings, and be happy to try their other items. Servings were plentiful and reasonably priced.

They also give you raw onions and picked radishes (for the koreans)! Gotta love Chinese-Korean food! Bring cash for tip!",0.9914,0.709,0.275,0.016,0.675152625152625
2007-11-04,3.0,"After years of hearing the Great Sea hype, I finally tried what seem to be the two most popular dishes here: sweet and spicy fried chicken and the ""ja jahng myun"" (noodles in black bean sauce).  Neither met my expectations.  The fried chicken was easy to eat like a lollipop, but they were very fatty.  Each drumstick is probably two parts chicken and one part fat.  They are crunchy and sit atop a puddle of what tastes like sweet soy sauce.  However, they weren't spicy at all.  The noodles were oily and were accompanied with plenty of cooked diced onions in the sauce.  You can fish for small chunks of beef too.  But since it was so oily, the sauce didn't stick to the noodles well, which didn't make it that easy to eat or enjoy.  Sadly, I prefer the instant noodle kind best.  We also ordered Mongolian beef which was also just ok. Somewhat of a small restaurant but rather diverse.  I saw Hispanics, East Asians, and Southeast Asians dining here.  The waitresses here don't speak English well, so don't expect friendliness.  The decor is kind of typical for a family style Asian restaurant: sturdy wooden tables and bamboo decor.  Overall, I don't think I'll come back here on my own will, as everything here is just average.",0.9909,0.776,0.195,0.029,0.5795555555555556
2007-10-15,5.0,"Anyone can make fried chicken but there are those who truly create a masterpiece that stands with creativity and passion.    Keeping it alive for 20 years and counting.... I give it up to Great Sea Chinese Restaurant.  On my arrival from the Chicago O'Hare airport, my buddy Trixie strongly recommended that I abandon my search for Chicago style pizza.    She brought us to Great Sea and totally convinced me to indulge on this local favorite.     She had no idea that I was writing for Yelp, so I agreed to her offer and was prepared to write about this restaurant.   This was a hit!   I was amazed that this "" hole in the wall "" establishment had a strong audience.     ""How Many Chicken Wings Can You Eat?""   I was shocked as I saw a huge display of visitor photos that have taken on this chicken wing challenge.    The reigning champ:  86 wings!!!    Oh My God!   In one sitting?   No!   Well, according to Karen of Great Sea, there's no trophy or cash prizes for each champion.    The current champ spent about four hours devouring all 86 pieces.   The chicken challenge is for ""bragging rights' and ""way of saying thank you to its big eaters"".    This is an awesome way of making your mark on the local community and Chicago visitors.   On this visit, there was no way I was going to take this challenge.   I was here to try the chicken and Yelp about it. So how's the Korean Chinese Fried Chicken, Walt?   SUPREME!     I rarely give a restaurant with my phrase, supreme.   Our chicken arrived with a pleasant warm aroma and glistened in its unique sweet sauce (see picture).     It met all my pertinent requirements for fried chicken: - Crunchy on outside without the oily mess. - Moist with the natural chicken oil intact - not the cooking oil. - Sauce was spicy but not over powering for me to struggle with its taste and herbs.   - Bonus feature:   They removed the unwanted parts like the tips and fatty skins leaving behind the actual meat cuts.   This exposed the bone making it easier to hold and eat the possible lean meat of the chicken.    I don't find this style of cooking anywhere except in expensive five star restaurants. The atmosphere of Great Sea presents the mom and dad home style restaurant with its glass mirrors, bamboo plants, and antique dining furniture.    This is another example why some restaurants don't need to invest into flashy dcor or high end furniture or dining ware in order to impress the world.       Unfortunately, I can't remember the other dishes we ordered for lunch.    I'm still hypnotized by the chicken.    One thing I forgot to pick up.   They sell bottles their famous hot and saucy sauce for $4.00.     My food comatose kicked so bad that I forgot.    I would have picked up a case.  In the spring of 2008, I'll be returning to Great Sea with friends from California.    With that being said.... this has made the ""Must Dine Here in Chicago"" list.     Tips to make your visit enjoyable: - Street parking only.   Try to find parking before lunch time.   The meters won't be waiting for you. - Arrive hungry.   Don't waste your time and money by visiting this place when you're half full.   You're really going to enjoy the chicken. - Perfect for lunch or dinner.   In this case, we had lunch here and were lucky because all we had to do was errands.   But if you have to go back to work after your lunch hour here at Great Sea, be ready for food comatose.  - Romantic?   Not really... but I'd rather say its perfect for get-togethers (family and friends).    Dining alone isn't bad either.  Thank you to Karen for great service and hospitality.     Trixie and I enjoyed this visit.",0.9995,0.66,0.271,0.069,0.6346009389671361

The jja jja myung (black bean sauce and noodles) are a bit on the oily side so make sure you have a cup of tea on the side.  The noodles are perfectly chewy and the sauce is savory.  But the real show-stealer is the drumsticks.  I order it hot, but that's because I'm used to spicy foods.  If you're not, you're better off sticking with the mild sauce.  The drumsticks are tender, juicy, and crispy.

We also ordered the shark fin soup and the salt and pepper smelt.  The soup was tasty, but not spectacular.  The smelts were terrific!  I love fried smelt, and theirs are crispy and meaty and seasoned just right.  Mmmmm.
