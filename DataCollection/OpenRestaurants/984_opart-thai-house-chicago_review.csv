2017-08-29,4.0,"Hands down the best thai food in the Bridgeport/South Loop area. My go to when I need a quick Thai Fix.  The food - I always get the tiger cry as an appetizer, you can't go wrong with. Basil chicken fried rice is a staple when I eat Thai food. Opart Thai house has different levels of spiciness and it really is spicy so order accordingly. I've also tried their Seafood Tom Yum Soup and Seafood Curry. Hands down the best Tom Yum Soup I've ever had and the Seafood curry was not too far behind.  The interior/ambiance - Huge interior, lots of visuals and artwork all around, well lit, spaced out, plenty of seating.  The service - Well experienced servers they have the whole menu memorized, quick with the refills and bill.  Pricing - Very reasonable pricing $$  Parking - There is meter parking on state street BUT! they do share a FREE parking lot in the back with all the other establishments in the area.  Overall - Highly recommended I'll be back to try out the different items on their menu.",0.9581,0.865,0.124,0.011,0.5140338164251208

A bit underwhelming to be honest and definitely not as good as some other Thai spots we've been to in the city. ~Pad Ped Pla Dook~Fried catfish sauteed with red curry paste, Thai eggplant and green beans. The flavors and spicy on this dish were excellent and it even included a side of rice in the listed price. Bravo. Only downside was I thought the portion was a bit skimpy.

2017-06-06,5.0,"Opart Thai House is mine and my family's favorite Thai restaurant in Chicago. They always have enough space to seat us when we dine out in a big group (I have a big family so usually a party of 15+). The food is always, always, ALWAYS amazing. And the prices are reasonable.  The decor is beautiful with golden jeweled head pieces and colorful artwork on display. The restaurant is always clean and the wait is never long.  Although you won't find the waitresses chatting you up or smiling too much for that matter, but they always get the job done.  We've been loyal Opart customers for many, many years, before this location even opened (Western location was the original) so we've tried our fair share of dishes. Everything on the menu is delicious! Seriously though!  BUTTTTT if you're struggling on deciding what to order, some of my favorites are:  *TIGER CRY...ITS AMAZING! (We always SHAMELESSLY order more than one. Ha!) *Shu-Mai *Poh Tak (seafood soup) *Khao Soy *Pad Thai *Seafood Combination Fried Rice *Any of the curries *Thai Iced Coffee  Opart Thai House never disappoints with their consistently delicious food!

2017-05-28,4.0,"Pretty good Thai place. I'm not sure how it compares to other places because it's the only Thai place around where I live so I can't really say it's the best.  I got the crab Rangoon, pad Thai with tofu, and mango sticky rice.  First off, there's no way you can screw up crab Rangoon. It's fried and just amazing. It's a safe appetizer that everyone will like.  The pad Thai was a little sweet so I'd recommend getting it a little spicy. (The medium spicy is barely spicy. I'd consider it white people spicy tbh). And just fyi, the protein you get is gonna be on the bland side just because of how flavorful the noodles are.  The mango sticky rice was awesome. It was a great way to end the meal. But if I'm gonna be honest, I don't think I've had bad mango sticky rice anywhere anyways.  Go here if you're craving Thai.

2017-05-26,5.0,"This was our first Chicago Thai experience. We were great fans of Rod Dee 2 in Boston and this place made me realize that Thai food comes in non-tofu dish shapes and sizes. We began our meal with the Tiger Cry. This dish is highly recommended by Yelpers and I would truly demand a larger serving if I wasn't terrified of the ever-so-slightly mean waitresses. The dish comes with olive oil and lemon sauce with Thai spices on the side and the beef is garnished with cilantro in a way that makes me, a Mediterranean person, accept the superiority of cilantro to parsley.  Our main courses were Catfish Curry and Duck Curry. I'll update the names of these when we go back again. My husband likes his southern cooking so he enjoyed the catfish more than someone like me did. This was my first time tasting duck. It feels like eating turkey only you're kind of upset that a cuter animal has been killed for you --we'll get back to my emotions later. We'll be coming back to try new dishes, it is a really clean and comfortable restaurant with nice warm Thai tea for this May 2017 that seems to forget its supposed to be a bit warmer.",0.9835,0.749,0.192,0.058,0.46054752066115695

The location was great and walking distance to Chinatown which is nice if you enjoy walking. The only downside to this is that there is no parking in the area and you'll have to pay to park. I'll def recommend getting on the CTA.  We started off with the Neau Num Tok and the Tom Yum Soup. The Neau Num Tok was absolutely amazing.... I don't remember if we requested it extra spicy but it had some raw onions in there and it was to die for. My girlfriend didn't like the taste of raw onions and she preferred the Tiger Cry which I found very bland and much on the sweet side. The Tom Yum soup was very nice too ... more on the sour side, I didn't like the imitation crab that was in it but everything else was great. We also shared a plate of their shrimp pad thai and it was delicious as well and a bit on the sweet side.  Finally we ordered some Mai Tai's and they were great.

The portions were generous and the flavors were pretty tasty. I liked the pad Thai more than my entree, which was a bit too sweet (probably the pineapples). The red duck curry had sliced boneless pieces of duck with skin, pineapples, and tomato.

It is a nice quaint restaurant and the service was great even with the language barrier that was between the waitress and myself. I have been here several times and the last time was for my birthday when a few of us got together and ordered just about everything on the menu...ok a slight exaggeration but our table was full and so was our bellies...lol  I will say if you eat beef then you can't leave without tasting the Tiger Cry it will make you do a happy dance right there at the table as the flavors explode on your tongue awakening your taste buds with every bite.  We had to order two more after everyone had a little taste of this beefalious treat.  I can't forget the sauce that comes with the Tiger Cry it was so good I was still eating when the beef was gone...lol We also had the Chicken Satay, Fried Shrimp Spring Rolls, Shu-Mai, Shrimp Tempura and the Crab Rangoon and it was all exceptional and fresh! I had the Tom Yum Koong(Shrimp) with a medium spice I don't know if I was a punk because I couldn't handle medium spice and when I told the waitress she brought me back a mild spice soup but it was not as flavorful as the medium spice one but it was still good all the same.  With all the appetizer we ordered I didn't order an Entrée but now I wish I did so I could have taken it home for leftovers.  Everyone's food looked so good and they all said that the food was very tasty...I will remember that the next time I go with a large group of friends. My daughter ordered Pad Paak Roum Mit I believe but don't quote me because sometimes all of the dishes sound the same in my head but anyway this is what happened...lol  After ordering the waitress asked my daughter how spicy did she want her meal and she said ""HOT!"" The waitress repeated ""HOT!"" with confidence my daughter said ""Yesss! I love HOT!"" The waitress in her own way was giving my daughter a warning ""You sure HOT!"" she just smiled and shook head and the waitress walked away and said ok...In her mind I know she had to be thinking ""Its your funeral!""  When the Entrée came to the table it smelled and looked so good but at first bite I think my daughter's eyebrows seared off her face...lol Her eyes started watering and then she picked up her glass of water to help with the heat and all that did was intensify the heat, that was the best laugh of the night.  My daughter was different than me she was determined to eat her meal but she did it very slowly...lol One of my friends had the Pad Lard Nar and she said it was simply delicious she got it at medium spice and loved it! I'm not going to get into what everyone had for one I would have to write a book not a review and two I can't remember everyone's Entrée from that night, but I can say there wasn't one complaint just nods of happiness. They also have BYOB which is cool and they don't have a cork fee that's always doubly nice. The wait staff was amazing and we didn't feel rushed we just sat there enjoying each others company, great food and wine. One more thing the parking can get critical on a Sunday when there is a game because there aren't to many places to park so make sure you read the signs because there were a lot of people with tickets on their cars.  Now this isn't the restaurants fault and I think that its a stupid rule because some people left because they drove around for a half an hour to find a park and couldn't find one that didn't have the No Parking Sign up during a certain event.  That to me hurts not only the business but the customer who has to walk a half a mile just to get to the restaurant.  I most definitely recommend this place so if you are in the neighborhood or if you are making plans don't forget Opart Thai Restaurant, in my opinion you won't regret it! I know I will be back!

2017-02-21,5.0,"One of my favorite Thai restaurants in the city. Asides from this location, there are two more. However, my friends and I always come back to this location due to the friendly staffs. We always end up ordering the same dishes. The Crab Rangoons is a must for appetizer (creamy on the inside and crunchy texture on the outside, hmm).  As for the main dishes, the red curry, the Tiger Cry, Tom Yum soup and the Pad Thai.  The Tiger Cry is OMG out of this world, the balance of spiciness, saltiness and sourness are on point. As for the Tom Yum soup, I would recommend getting the fish instead of the shrimp. They tend to be more generous with the fish. I remembered getting 4-5 shrimps with my order of soup (so not worth). The Red curry is amazing, creamy texture with the perfect amount of heat. As for the Pad Thai, it's aight (can be a hit or a miss, depending on the day). As for the drinks, the Thai Tea is a must. However, they also serve alcoholic drinks too. Free parking, however, limited space depending on the day.",0.9569,0.827,0.126,0.046,0.4015406162464986
2017-02-13,4.0,"Okay, this is a little weird to write because I'm not quite sure how to specifically name this ingredient that causes my discomfort at some Thai restaurants (but very few - maybe one other place that this has happened...?) The restaurant smells like a mixture of wet dog and urine. Like I said, this has happened to me maybe one other time at another Thai restaurant. I'm guessing it's some ingredient that has a heavy, unpleasant odor when it goes bad...? Again, I'm not sure.  HOWEVER, my boyfriend and I stopped here for an early dinner on a Saturday. It was around 4pm and there were a few tables taken, so it was obviously a popular place. The smell bothered both of us, but we were starving so we stayed. I'M GLAD WE DID. We ordered the Tiger Cry, Pad Thai and Broccoli Lover's with chicken.  The Tiger Cry was AMAZING and we'll probably return just because of that. It was smoked(?) with a lovely flavor and perfectly tender. They should definitely expand a smaller menu with this as the focal point! So yummy!! The Pad Thai was pretty typical but I'm always pleased to find a place that does it well since I can't say amazing thai food is easy to come by in Chicago for some reason. I'm always excited to go to New York to get some incredible Thai food. The Broccoli Lover's with chicken seemed to skimp out on the broccoli, believe it or not. Very basic and good for someone watching their diet closely.  So, go if you can get over the smell. If you can't, definitely order delivery because I still really enjoyed the food!",0.9947,0.702,0.216,0.082,0.6645279165279164

Still, noodle dish was satisfying and did the trick, especially considering the price. The place also has a decent selection of wine and beer.

First off, I ordered a Vietnamese coffee, peanut sauce spring rolls and a chicken pad Thai. Never will be ordering from here again. The coffee was nothing like a normal sweet Vietnamese coffee and tasted like a regular iced coffee. The spring rolls aren't ""spring rolls."" They're wrapped in some thick pastry wrap and stuffed with just an egg roll, cucumber, tofu and bean sprouts that don't even appear to be edible. Lastly, my Pad Thai that I was looking forward to consuming was so difficult to eat as all the noodles were just stuck together and there was no taste to it. They didn't even give me Sriracha so I'm just using my own to try to disguise the tasteless meal. Chicken was overcooked and it's just noodles and chicken and nothing green.  I was expecting no gourmet meal but I was expecting food that I could eat.

Have been here on multiple occasions and have also ordered carry out from here as well and they have never failed me whenever I have cravings for Thai food and flavors! Some of my favorites are the Khao Soy with chicken, the papaya salad, and their seasonal Mango with Thai Sticky Rice.  The Khao Soy is a creamy coconut curry dish with thin egg noodles and topped with crispy fried egg noodles. This combination is heavenly dangerous! The curry is seriously bowl licking good! The papaya salad compliments the curry well with the refreshing fish sauce based sauce and crunchy shredded green papaya, carrots, string beans, and tomatoes. The addition of the pessimist is what really makes this salad so dynamic and great. The nutty, sweet, and slightly sour flavors make me go back for more.  The Mango and Thai Sticky Rice is seasonal so I always feel extremely lucky whenever they let me know that they do have it that day! The mangoes they use are always sweet and ripe from my experiences! The rice is also nicely sweetened with the coconut milk and sprinkled with sesame seeds.

The flavor is authentic and fresh. Food was delivered 30 minutes after I ordered, when I was quoted 1hr-1.25hrs for delivery and was definitely still hot! They also properly packaged the food which I truly appreciate so I wasn't greeted by a soupy, wet mess that one has been accustomed to when it comes to deliveries.

Let me start by saying that I live in Hyde Park where there are quite a few Thai restaurants that I frequent often. Opart Thai stands above the rest before of the sheer freshness and unique flavors of its entrées. For appetizers, my friend and I dined on two orders of Tiger Cry (it's THAT good), Shu Mai, Spring Rolls and Cucumber Salad. The Tiger Cry is a dish of thinly sliced pieces of beef fried in an addictive sweet and spicy sauce. Don't dine there without trying it! For dinner, I had the Pad Thai with Shrimp. The noodles were fresh with a hint of sweetness, the cabbage was crisp and the shrimp was big and succulent. Dare I say it was the best I've had.  Now dessert absolutely blew my mind. My friend told me I had to try the Mango and Sticky Rice. I truly am glad I did. Maybe it's because I'm 9 months pregnant, but darn it, I do believe I am in love.

2015-09-15,2.0,Disappointed at this Thai establishment! Thai food being one of my top go to food and since I have been craving for some good thai food every since I moved to Chicago - I thought to give this a try since they had such high rating. Totally disappointed :(. So first to mention the good things - they have a free parking lot at the back of the store which is great for some one who sucks at parallel parking. They will substitute tofu as protein for any of their dishes. The soup tom yum broth was really flavorful and tat is where the good things end. They don't have soft tofu and they use this tofu which they semi fry but the texture is really tough and taste like old tofu which has been sitting around for long. The basil fried rice was not spicy nor tasted or smelt of basil. The Pad Ped (Normally my fav Thai Curry) had no gravy/sauce and the veges were still left raw so they had no flavor. The fresh roll does not taste or look like a fresh roll - it is a semi fried veg roll with tofu and sauce poured over it. The tofu satay with peanut sauce and cucumber salad tastes weird - again I think becoz of the tofu they use...Over all still looking for a good Thai Place...any recommendations?,0.949,0.805,0.131,0.064,0.5080816714150048

Anyways the Khao Soy had all the things that I would typically enjoy; coconut curry, onions, egg noodles, chicken, and lime. Sounds like a winner right? It wasn't. I don't know why I didn't like it, it tasted one note. We got our dish ordered hot on the spicy scale and the spice completely overwhelmed the subtlety of the dish. So that's on me I guess. But my wife loved it soooooo. To each his own I guess. The Peanut Sauce Lover was great though. The beef was nice and tender and the sauce was silky and velvety. The cashews add some texture which was welcome. Definitely have it with rice, otherwise the dish isn't enough to share. Speaking of rice, they only give you a small portion of it here. About half of what is the norm for Asian restaurants. Although the prices were phenomenal so you can't really complain, $19 for two dishes.  All in all this is a pretty safe bet if you want some local Thai. But if you're thinking about driving 20+ minutes to eat here, you can probably find a place just as good next to you.",0.9967,0.736,0.241,0.024,0.5936748436748437

I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai and requested it Extra Hot, but nope it wasn't spicy at all. The taste, despite lacking the spiciness, was good. I also got the Tiger Cry, which was pretty good, but to me the meat was a little bit hard. Their Thai Iced Thai wasn't too shabby at all either. One of my friends had the Khao Soy (Boiled egg noodles with chicken in coconut curry soup topped with crispy egg noodles, onions and lime) which was not too bad. Overall, it was good food. Couldn't say it's great, or the best in Chicago, but it wasn't disappointing certainly. Their location is definitely convenient, located just a bit outside of Chinatown, and in the South Loop area. Their place is well-decorated with a lot of authentic Thai headdresses on their wall. The waitress was pretty good in handling our big party's order as well.

The tiger cry (appetizer) came out first. It tasted sweet and sour, but good. After it, I kind of had high expectation for rest of our dishes. However, our other dishes were not good. It seems like the cook putted sugar in stead of salt in the dishes. Everything was sweet and sour.... Our Tom yum soup was very light which was not like tom yum we had in other places.  The worst are our main dishes. The larb is very sweet and sour, and it came out with a 1/4 of lettuce. My friend has to cut it with a spoon.  My curry dish is very very light, and it was not like curry at all (which should be creamy). The menu said the curry has coconut milk and I wonder how could you make such light curry with milk. I just doubt they didn't put any milk in.

Recently we had it delivered and it was only a slight delivery fee.  We were quoted 45 minutes and had a knock in 30.  I will say the only disappointment here was that the delivery driver smelled strongly of cigarette smoke and the brown bag that the food was in even had a bit of a smoke smell after he left (something to address here Opart!).  However, the food tasted delicious and they are now our go-to Thai here in the loop.   (Small warning, they run a bit more spicy than some others so you may want to go a step less spicy and add spice if needed!)",0.9276,0.851,0.108,0.041,0.5238690476190476

2015-01-26,4.0,"My sister and I came here for lunch. She was craving Thai food. We read a bunch of the reviews and almost everyone mentioned the Tiger Cry so of course we had to try that. It was good but extremely salty. It came with the sauce and the sauce was very flavorful but also very salty. The meat came on top of a piece of lettuce. My sister and I split the lettuce at the bottom and put the meat on top and rolled it up so it could help balance the saltiness of the meat. The cucumber was very good. It also helped to balance all the flavors. We also ordered the Crab Rangoon. This was very different from Chinese restaurant versions. It was folded differently, almost like a little bag, so all the stuff inside would ooze out when you bite into it. The skin was extremely crispy. The filling was flavorful. We loved it. This was our favorite here. My sister ordered the Gaeng Pet Ped (Red curry with roasted duck, pineapple and tomatoes). This was different. We usually eat duck when it is roasted, with the skin crispy, but this particular dish had the duck drenched in the red curry. It wasn't bad. I ordered fried catfish with green beans and red curry paste. It was very spicy. It didn't hit us in the beginning while we were eating. Both dishes were good.

2014-07-09,3.0,"Being underwhelmed sucks. It's a simple fact of life; The higher your expectations, the higher the odds of you being disappointed.  After reading dozens of Yelpers extol the spicy virtues of Opart Thai House's curries and the famed Tiger Cry, I tried to order delivery to my residence 2.5 miles from the restaurant, but was informed that they refused to deliver to where I live. Still, I decided to take a trip to taste what people have described as the best thai restaurant in Chicago.  As described, the decor is quite nice, and it is a surprisingly clean, well-kept restaurant with a large staff and a busy, bustling atmosphere, even in the middle of the week. I think the service may suffer as a result of their popularity, however; It took 20 minutes after I was seated for anyone to talk to me or ask if I wanted anything to drink, while the table next to me was seated at the same time, and received their food before I could even place mine; It's not a good feeling when you're hungry! I ordered the thai iced tea, Tiger Cry,  and a Green Curry with shrimp, which came to roughly $24 before tax and tip. The thai tea was good, but had an overwhelming amount of condensed milk, making it cloyingly sweet. The Tiger Cry is, as many have described, char-broiled beef served with a tangy dipping sauce, and represents a unique dish to this thai restaurant. However, I would argue that it is remarkably similar to the Bo Luc Lac you might find at a good Vietnamese restaurant, with the exception that I believe the Vietnamese version is more tender, and sometimes cheaper.  The green curry I ordered was nicely balanced, with a good amount of vegetables and basil, and a hearty, creamy coconut broth, although I was disappointed with the portion size and the spice level. Despite ordering the dish with a spice level of 8/10, I hardly got any spice in my dish; I can't tell if their food is generally watered-down on spice or if my server didn't take my request for 'pretty spicy' seriously.  Overall, I think Opart is OK. If I could get fast, no-hassle delivery from here, I most certainly would, but I've had much better thai food in my life, and I just don't think the food here is in any way remarkable or exceptional, so I'll keep searching for a spot in Chicago that really blows me away.",0.8963,0.787,0.113,0.1,0.5274099883855983

2014-07-03,5.0,"Overall, great food at even greater prices. APPETIZERS - Fresh Spring Rolls: I really wanted to like these after reading the great reviews, but I hated them! Yes, the peanut sauce is amazing, but the rolls themselves are awful. The wrapping is not fried or steamed from what I can tell. It just tastes weirdly raw. - Egg Rolls: This is what I expect when I order rolls. These ones are filled with ground chicken + vegetables, and they're pretty good. They are fried, but I was feeling a bit unhealthy. The sweet and sour sauce is a little too sweet for my taste, but have these with their amazing peanut sauce and it is absolutely amazing. ENTREE So far, I have only tried the Panang curry. I order Panang at every Thai restaurant, so I would like to think of myself as a bit of a connoisseur. And, the Panang here is absolutely amazing. It has the just the right amount of the peanut flavoring. The consistency is perfect - not too thick, but also not watered down. The curry here as a lot more basil, but I think it adds a nice kick to the entire curry.  PRICES The prices are amazing. You can easily get a meal less than $10. I believe the Panang is ~$9 and the appetizers are somewhere between ~$5-$7 - extremely reasonable. This place is also a great option for delivery. They deliver within the hour, the food is still hot, and their delivery fee is only $3.",0.9963,0.681,0.262,0.057,0.6825300430563588

This place had a good rating and it wasn't too far away, and I thought I would be more likely to find a parking spot around here than in Chinatown. For an appetizer, I had the fresh spring rolls, which come in a super delicious peanut sauce. So good, if it came in a bottle, I'd be tempted to drink it! We ordered the sole fish soup (can't remember the name of it!) which was delicious! Tangy lemongrass broth, succulent fish, yummy straw mushrooms. Very good and it comes in a really neat warming bowl that is decorative and keeps it warm for a while at your table. Also ordered one of the Lad Nar options with peapods and baby corn. Though the noodles weren't what I expected (used to thicker noodles and these were glass noodles, very very thin and delicate), they were still delicious. The ""gravy"" is delicious, sweet and smoky and the vegetables were just right! We had come in during the Sunday lunch rush, but they were still rather speedy. Perhaps not a good idea if you need a quick lunch break from work, unless you order ahead, but still the wait was negligible considering all the people in there! The service was good, very nice people who welcome you in and thanked you as you leave. Also a very beautiful atmosphere with interesting Thai décor.

For an appetizer, we started out with the fresh spring rolls- those are the best I've had with the peanut sauce.  Not too filling either, a perfect setup for what is to come.  For the entree I'd try the pad thai or the curry chicken fried rice.  Those are my go-to dishes here.  I like a good amount of spice and these dishes definitely bring it, but not too much that I'm sweating.  Truly the perfect amount of spice. The best thing about the fried rice is that it wasn't greasy, I hate fried rice that is too greasy that you can't even taste the chicken or vegetables in it.   Also the soups looked really good too!  I've never ordered them myself but one of my friends did and he enjoyed it.   If I find myself in south loop again, I'd come here in a second.",0.9949,0.768,0.232,0.0,0.5204545454545454

FOOD: Menu was huge with many pictures of their signature dishes. We started with an order of egg rolls, which were tasty.. We ordered their curry chicken fried rice which tasted pretty good, but was lacking in salt. Their panang chicken curry was really good as well and it came with a small side of white rice. We also ordered their pad ka prow (spelling? but it's their ground chicken dish which there is a picture associated with it in their menu), which was the best dish. It was mildly spicy/sweet ground chicken ontop of white rice. The juices from the chicken was captured by the white rice and it tasted sooo good!  SERVICE: Our waiter was not attentive and rarely refilled our water. She seemed inattentive and annoyed. We also had a second server that later refilled our drinks. We asked her if we could get a to-go box and the check, but she does not speak nor understand English. She promptly went to go bring someone else that did speak English, which was nice.  OVERALL: very satisfied with their Thai flavors, disappointed by our waiter's lack of attentiveness. Good portion sizes for their main dishes. Will definitely return to try their other dishes,.

I'd really been craving Thai food, noodles and a flavorful soup were what I wanted.  The one redeeming thing is that the service was good. Nice person on the phone and they were prompt to ring me up and give me my food.  I ordered egg rolls to start, bami moo daeng and tom ka chicken soup... The egg rolls were OK. I'll give it to them that they don't use the usual fluorescent pink sweet and sour sauce.  The bami moo daeng, which are egg noodles with BBQ pork, were dry and didn't have much flavor dimension. It was nearly as if the noodles had been cooked and set aside in advance.  The tom ka chicken soup had WAY too much coconut milk in it. I could taste the coconut milk and not much else -- and I'd ordered it at medium spice. The chicken in it was tough and bland. And that's all that was in it, broth and chicken.

Pot stickers were surprisingly good and the spring rolls too if your a vegetarian. Oh and Thai iced tea is bomb too.,0.9161,0.758,0.184,0.058,0.7749999999999999
2013-12-16,2.0,"My friends and I decided to eat good Thai food that is nearby, mostly because I never ate Thai food before. My friends recommended either the Pad Thai or the Pad See-Iew along with some appetizers. For appetizers, we had the Chicken Satay and Egg Rolls. I love the Chicken Satay. The chicken skewers were grilled nicely - tender without being dry. What made the skewers tasty was the peanut sauce with its richness and subtle sweetness. The cucumber salad was deliciously sweet and worked well with the chicken satay with peanut sauce. It refreshes your palate after the richness of the peanut sauce. This appetizer is so delicious that I would enjoy eating chicken skewers with peanut sauce over rice as an entrée along with the cucumber salad as a side. The Egg Rolls were not impressive to me. Along with their sweet-and-sour sauce, it tastes like any other fried egg rolls I had in a Chinese restaurant. I decided on the Chicken Pad See-Iew. I was disappointed. The dish was too sweet for my taste even though it was stir-fried with sweet soy sauce. It had a really mild bitter aftertaste after the sweetness.  I did not realize what flat rice noodles were until my food came. I do not like these noodles. Flat rice noodles become really soggy as it soaks up any liquid and clump up; it is like eating mashed rice with a slight resiliency with each bite. Because it was soggy and clumpy, it collected all the sweet soy sauce and made the dish really sweet for me. There wasn't much textural contrast besides the chicken, which was slightly overcooked and the crunch from the Chinese broccoli. I would prefer my chicken overcooked and firm in this dish because it makes the textural contrast from the soft noodles more defined. However, the chicken was still slightly moist, probably from all that sweet soy sauce. Aside from the food, the ambience is good. The décor is beautiful, especially the wall of traditional Thai headgears. The service was great. What was different about this restaurant compared to other restaurants that I liked was the fact that our glasses were filled with water along with a bottle of water so we can refill it anytime. I like this because I do not have to ask for water if the service is bad. Overall, I may come back to this restaurant if I am craving Thai food; however, I do not crave Thai food often. If I do come back, I would definitely get the Chicken Satay for appetizer; however, I would not recommend getting the Egg Rolls or the Chicken Pad See-Iew unless you like egg rolls in general or if you like the texture of flat rice noodles. I rate this place with two stars; it would have been less if it was not for the Chicken Satay.",0.9973,0.796,0.177,0.027,0.5793055555555556

Until I'd taken the girls from work it was always just the two of us and the service was great. Adding that third person to the mix killed the service. I know they are busy, so maybe hire someone in addition to help out?  I took the girls from work and we got the tigers cry - it's as good as everyone says, trust me. We all really loved our meal, but again, the service just tanked. I ordered basil chicken to take home for dinner and they forgot to place it.

The potstickers were  so freakin' strange. At first, when I opened the package I was really excited because they were so huge.......but once I bit into them it was an entirely different story. The ""deep-fried"" skin around the potstickers was abnormally thick and chewy, which made the meat inside of the potstickers lukewarm and bunched up. Like, literally.....the meat inside looked like a gray, upchucked cat hairball. And every time I bit into a pot sticker, the ball would just slide out of the slimy, chewy shell and I had to keep putting it back in the potsticker skin. So gross. And the pad-see eww didn't even taste like pad-see eww. I finished about 1/8 of it and  had to throw it away because it was so sour and strange tasting. My noodle dish was still piping hot when I threw it in the trash. That's how much I couldn't stand eating it. The only reason why I'm giving this place an extra star is because the delivery man seemed friendly. Maybe the sit-down restaurant experience is different here......but dude.

Wow it's full of so much flavor. Charbroiled strips of tender steak marinated it the most delicious sweet and tangy sauces. The tart lime dipping sauce is off the charts. I also love their shrimp fried rice. They add an abundant amount of egg which to me is a plus. The pad tai is decent a bit too soggy for my taste but nonetheless very tasty. The fried BBQ pork with white rice topped with gravy is very hard to swallow. The pork is way too dry and I didn't taste the barbecue sauce. The gravy was very dry and the flavor was sort of a bird seed cardboard box mix. Not pleasant at all. The fried banana dessert rolls are very taste. It has a plantain and cream cheese filling and the fried roll is coated in honey and topped with sesame seeds. Very yummy ending to a delicious meal.  Don't get me started on the wait staff.

Best eaten at the restaurant, rather than delivered. The hotter the better.  I stick to Khao Soi as an entre for the most part. It can get very spicy, but the sauce is executed so well and if you order veggie style, there are plenty of veggies to soak up the sauce. Great hangover food.  I see that a few other reviews have pointed out the flawed service. I must admit, I've had some pretty rude service here. I once asked what Thai Coffee was, and was told ""It's coffee!"" with a very snappy attitude. I now know that it is not just coffee.

I also had the green curry with eggplant, green beans, and basil; I ordered it with tofu.  I think this is my favorite green curry in the city.  Sometimes, the eggplant will be a little undercooked, but yesterday it was perfect and exactly what I wanted.  I am pretty hard on the Thai restaurants in Chicago and I think, currently, this one in my favorite.  I am planning on trying their green papaya salad next time and maybe the tom yum soup.  I will definitely get delivery from here again.",0.9859,0.832,0.16,0.008,0.5268115942028986

Food came out quickly and at proper intervals. (Granted we weren't there at a particularly busy time.) Portion sizes were good, but not huge.

As for food, nothing outside of what others have said. The Tiger Cry appetizer was really good. Tender and came with a delicious home made sauce. The crab rangoon were forgettable and they were out of the peanut sauce spring rolls, which I can imagine are very good.  I got the Lard Nar Talay  flat rice noodles stir-fried with shrimp, squid, crab stick and Chinese broccoli, topped with homemade gravy. This is risky when eating with a big group. I felt like I should have gone safe with the pad thai, which looked really good by the way with big shrimp. But I took a shot and was pretty pleasantly surprised. Seafood was good and big portion. Excess sauce was equally satisfying over white rice. I'd order this again.  Do yourself a favor and try some Thai Iced Coffee. It's kinda like a drink from Starbucks and hits the spot.

To start off we ordered the sampler appetizer, soup, basil chicken and fried rice. 10 minutes later we get our appetizer.  It was ok, nothing outstanding, then not even 2 minutes later we get our soup and then the main entrees. It is as if we were being rushed with one after the other.  Was she trying to make up to us for taking 20 minutes to get to our table?  The fried rice was good, however the basil chicken was cold the rice was not at all fresh.  When the waitress came back I asked her if the Basil Chicken was supposed to be hot or cold.  She said hot, I advised her it was not then she said it is, really?? Then she asked do you want it warmed up, well if I am asking you if it is cold or hot what do you think? The server comes back with the dish which you can clearly see she had microwaved the dish because the way the basil had shriveled and only the center of the entree was warmer than before. After that our phantom server vanished again.  I was truly expecting more from this place since it was recommended from a friend but after yesterdays awful food an bad service I would rather go out of my way and go to Thai Pastery on Broadway and Argyle where the service is more attentive and the food is fresh and hot!.   Again I do realize that they were a little busy but there is no excuse for the service or food.",-0.4284,0.873,0.077,0.05,0.5688034188034188

I have been occasionally returning to Opart since my last review, mainly because it has convenient parking and a comfortable interior. But each time, I find myself disappointed more and more by the quality of the food. The pad see ew is disgustingly sweet and the pad thai is so bleh. I don't usually judge a restaurant on anything besides the quality of the food. But I guess the meal was made even more monotonous by how terrible the service was. During this visit, I made sure to tell the waitress to make my pad thai ""hot please""/""extra hot""/""really hot""/""remember...hot."" Four times - because last time they forgot as well. If your pad thai is going to be boring, I'd prefer some spiciness. I guess the waitress couldn't beleaguer the cook to add a pinch of chili. When I brought it to her attention, she slammed a pot of dried pepper on the table and told me to do it myself. Well... great restaurant you are.

They were doused in peanut sauce & totally not what I was expecting - normally you get the sauce on the side for dipping & the rolls were cut in half already.

2012-01-27,1.0,"Went to Opart tonight hoping to get some Thai before going to the movies. It was a HUGE mistake. The place maybe had 10 tables occupied, which for a Friday night is not very busy. We were seated with out any verbal connection to the waiter. She just put the menus on the table and walked away as if we knew we were to follow her.  We sat down and within a few minutes our order was taken. This is where the experience really fell apart. While waiting for our food to arrive we noticed the table next to us (who arrived long after we did) had their appetizers and we hadn't seen anything related to our order. We started looking toward the kitchen to see if anything connected to our dinner might be ready. After glaring at the waitress for a few minutes she came to our table and acknowledged our food would be out shortly -- apparently due to a lot of carry out orders. No big deal, we figured. We still had time before needing to leave for a movie.  A few minutes later our first dish arrived and were told the second item would be out momentarily. But, as one might imagine, it wasn't on its way out. Next thing I know, the table next to us -- the one who arrived after us and had their appetizers before our food, was served their main course. Still no sign of the waitress or our food. We literally had to grab her as she walked by to ask where the remaining dish was.  Upon her return to the table after visiting the kitchen, she explained it would be out in a couple minutes. Yeah, right. Heard that story already. We instructed her to cancel the order. We were out of time.  They didn't charge us for the never delivered dish. But after having totally ruined our dining experience (have you ever sat in a restaurant watching the person across from you eat, while you're expecting your food to arrive?) they charged us for the entire meal.  The service was bad enough. But then actually charging the $10 for the privilege to watch the other person in your party eat is a total insult.  I'm never going back. If you want inconsistent service, so-so Thai, and staff that doesn't know how to resolve a problematic experience, then this is the place for you.  For me?

2011-12-17,4.0,"Thanks to fellow Yelpers, I visited this restaurant while staying at the McCormick Center Hyatt, an area where restaurant choices are largely limited to what is in the hotel or convention center unless you get into a cab and head into the loop. I notice that a lot of people like to pontificate on the authenticity (or inauthenticity) of an ethnic restaurant in their reviews, and this always puzzles me a little. I'm Italian,  and any traditional meal cooked by my native Italian family members will be prepared differently, presented differently, and -- taste different!  So, I confess, even though I've eaten at many a Thai restaurant, I have no clue what ""real Thai food"" is. Shocking, isn't it?! Stop reading right here before I corrupt your culinary sensibilities!  What I *do* know is that my husband and I enjoyed our meal at Opart Thai. I had the Pad Prik with shrimp, and my husband had green curry chicken. Both dishes were flavorful, seemingly made with quality ingredients, and served promptly. Shrimp is always a risky order in any small restaurant, but mine was cooked nicely. Our waitress was a woman of few words, but she gave us nothing to complain about. The decor is unremarkable, tables are fairly close together, and the noise level was a little too loud at times. This is a casual, no-frills restaurant, but the food was good and the prices were extremely reasonable.

Not the best thai restaurant in Chicago, but I was really happy to find great thai food south of the loop. i like that this is a place that would work for a casual but nice date, a dinner with friends, or a dinner with family. More detail: Went there with the bf, and we got crab rangoon, tom yum goong (spicy soup with shrimp), pad bai krapao with chicken (ground chicken stir fried with basil and jalapenos), and khao soi (spicy curry with chicken over egg noddles, with fresh onion). Everything was great, but standouts were the tom yum and khao soy...ordered both at the ""spicy"" level and it was just right. the krapao was tasty, but we ordered it at a ""spicy"" level and it was lacking in that. Order a side of rice to spoon into the tom yum and it'd make a great meal instead of a side/appetizer. We ate till we were stuffed, and still had leftovers of khao soi and pad krapao. Which by the way, goes great on top of leftover Thanksgiving mashed potatoes as a late-night, got the alcohol-munchies snack. Take that, KFC potato bowl.  I was really amused that you can get a caipirinha and mojito at this thai restaurant. i got a lychee martini instead, it was just ok, perhaps i'll just stick to the beer next time, and you can't beat a special of 2 Chang beers for $5. also random note, i misspelled caipirinha the first time and the yelp spell-check caught it, but apparently doesn't recognize mojito...weird!

I said no he repeated shrimp, but interestingly enough he didn't write it down.  He seemed impatient to get the order and he didn't seem genuine enough to care about the mistake.  Instead of insisting or offering to take it back he brought us a side of the shrimp instead, and I had to mix it in with the noodles myself.  I couldn't believe the laziness.  We weren't trying to have 3 chicken dishes.  I'm not trying to say that the customer is always right, but don't make it feel like a hassle to make us happy.  The food was very tasty, and I was able to get my friend to like a new dish that I have always liked.  I will probably not sit inside again, but will order carry out and delivery based on my dine-in experience.",0.9755,0.847,0.114,0.039,0.5979158467794833

Next I got adventurous and had the red curry with duck.  It was in a coconut sauce and was suppose to be spicy, but I think they forgot to put the heat in as it was overly sweet, and I couldn't really enjoy it as much as I would of liked to.  I think if made correctly it could have been fantastic, but I still ate most of it so it wasn't too bad.        So the soup was bad, entree's decent, but that Tiger cry appetizer saves the entire review for this restaurant and will definitely keep me coming back for more.",0.9844,0.781,0.158,0.062,0.5185714285714286

Seriously, when grocery store instant pad thai is better than your restaurant's pad thai, you are doing it horribly horribly wrong. It was a squishy mess of noodles that tasted like it had been dumped in an overly sweetened unidentifiable orange muck. I paid a dollar extra for the driest, blandest chicken I've ever had. The boyfriend's panang curry with beef was the most minimalist curry ever: it was exactly curry sauce, beef, and rice.

Originally, it would be rated five stars, but I realized that Opart isn't the best Thai restaurant and that I need to find another. I will tell you though, their Pad See Eew is out of this world. It's the best I've had in Chicago. Your initial impression of the dish will be that of a boring, brown noodle dish, but wait until you taste it. There is no sauce, but the noodles are savory thanks to the sweet soy sauce. The Chinese broccoli is crisp with a little bite (it is part of the mustard-green family, after all). Pad See Eew is a delightfully simple, but delicious dish. I strongly recommend ordering it here. I've had their Pad Thai, which is also good. A little dry for my liking. My boyfriend has ordered many curry dishes and all are pretty stellar. I don't think he has had anything he disliked. At Opart, if you ask for Thai spicy, they will make you hurt.

I am now on the look-out for a new Thai restaurant where food is good and authentic (as it can be) and the service is a little more personable. I prefer taking my business to a place that remembers me (and there are places that do, even after one visit - read my review on Ben's Noodles).

The pros: the tiger cry is the best dish, maybe the best beef dish i have ever had. Wonderful dipping sauce, very tender beef, and the most yummy grilled beef ever. Pad see ewe, sweet and sour fish, spicy sweet garlicky squid and shrimp dishes are the best. Chicken sate and peanut sauce are perfect every time. I love crab rangoon, and theirs is very tasty, but it's often raw in the corners, undercooked. Just ask for it well-done and it will be fine. The food overall is superb. I've worked at Thai restaurants and have had excellent, authentic Thai food, and this is some of the best around. Also, weirdly, rice comes with the dishes, but it's extra at the northside Opart, despite the prices being the same. The decor is also nicer here as compared to the northside Opart. The cons: i've ordered takeout often. Once they used a smaller container for the pad thai. I complained and they gave me a credit on my next order. Several times the rice had weird pink chunks cooked into it. I've seen this when the rice is rotten. I complained, and they sent out more rice, at no extra cost. Some of their servers are wonderful. Some of them try to clear you out of the restaurant within 1 hour, regardless of if you're finished eating, have ordered more food (no joke), even when the restaurant only has 3 other tables. My biggest complaint is the surly servers who never smile, just grunt at you, and make you feel like they're doing you a favor letting you into the restaurant. I see this at other Asian restaurants too, and i always make sure my tip reflects how they make me feel ( I usually tip over 20% for normal, uneventful good service, more for better service).

I was visiting Chicago so I can't go back until the next time I'm in town. But, my friend lives near Chicago and she's already planned to go back, lol.

The things I order are consistently excellent...always chicken satay, and (I don't remember the name of that beef salad that is unbelieveably good) and curry fried rice. Last time BF got a squid dish that was beautiful and (he said) delicious. The food here is always so fresh and nicely presented. The place was packed and noisy last time I was there, but service was still very good...I've been in there when service was just a *bit* slow, but that is really the only thing I can see wrong with this place.

We got the rest of our food to go including soup which we never asked to be packed. After that we started driving, I noticed a fishy smell in our car and I wondered if it was the food. So I lift up the bag to see if the smell is from the food and the bag breaks away from the bottom spilling every morsel of food in the boxes in the bag which formed a slow leak and soaked the bottom of the bag. The culprit, the soup was packed upside down, the soup we never asked to be packed to begin with. It cost me 2 hours on a Sunday night to clean up the car after getting home at 9 pm! All could've been avoided if the half-with waitress packed properly or just listened to what we wanted to take home.

The dish needed a little more flavor.  My cousin ordered the chicken pad thai with no bean sprouts.... the chef cooked it with bean sprouts and the waitress asked if my cousin would be okay with it? My cousin said no she doesn't want the bean sprout... Ten minutes later she still don't get a new dish.. Maybe 20 minutes later it finally arrives. It doesn't take that long to re-make a pad thai dish especially when at least 10 other dish has gone out before than.

Let's start with the following observations -- Note that many of the positive reviews below include phrases like ""I'm so pleased that I am branching out beyond pad thai"" and ""I don't eat much Thai food."" Those folks love this place - maybe that ought to tell you something. After a year of hearing how great this place was, I finally tried this place for dinner last night. A frequent sola diner, I am cognizant of the fact that the bills for single diners are less than those of larger parties. So I try to walk the line between ""Who cares - I have a right to eat out, too"" and ""Let's make this worth the effort for the servers."" In other words, I always order some kind of beverage, an appetizer, and an entree. Still, you would think that my Monday night dinner at this place was like asking the server to rub my feet. As mentioned in another review below, the server never smiled. She barely spoke to me at all, and instead said such brusque things as ""You ready?"" and ""You done?"" Classy. Also not cool - apparently they charge for rice here. WTF? It's already a moderately priced entree at $8-9 a place. Now, oh by the way, it's another dollar for the rice. And that, as far as I remember, isn't indicated anywhere on the menu. And, my server never asked what spiciness level I would prefer. But when I got my ticket, she had assumed ""mild.""  The whole thing was super-annoying. I both eat and cook a lot of Thai food. And what I was presented with at Opart Thai was not that great. Coupled with the poor service and attitude, it just left me with a very bitter taste in my mouth. * Spring rolls had been sitting around for too long and were a bit chewy. Also, filled with minimal ingredients, so not very flavorfull. Finally, they were DRENCHED in oily peanut sauce so were no longer a healthy option. * Someone was too heavy handed with the fish oil in my curry dish, and the eggplant and green beans (but especially the eggplant) were seriously under-prepared. I like crisp vegetables, but the eggplant was so crisp that I feared for an upset stomach later and simply stopped eating it. Too bad, since it was a good 1/3 of the dish. In all, a very disappointing experience. I will say that the setting is really nice and the location is convenient to both bus and train lines.

The person who answers the phone for pick-up/delivery is always always always EXTREMELY rude. Talking to him pisses me off and it's a shame since the middle-aged man who delivers is usually the sweetest guy. The food is mediocre. All their curries taste the same (a friend ordered for me once and picked the wrong one--I genuinely did not notice until my friend realized her mistake when the order was already on the way). When actually going there to eat, the server is almost non-existent. Comes in once to take your order, then one more to take your money. With the exception of the one delivery man, everyone else is ridiculously rude. I'm usually not this catty in reviews, but honestly their rudeness makes me feel less guilty about this review.

I know it's lame and somewhat unadventurous, but when pad Thai is done right, it's like crack. I always switch it up a bit, adding shrimp or tofu or chicken and requesting extra cabbage, carrots, peanuts and lime. It's always so fresh and tasty. My boyfriend wasn't aware he liked pad Thai until he had opart's.  Their tiger cry is marinated beautifully and always delicious. It's a signature dish and does not disappoint. The sauce they serve on the side isn't my favorite, I just love the meaty pieces dry, Mmm. I always order the staple mini eggrolls- deliciously thin crispy shells & crab rangoon- more cream cheese, not so much crab, but still yummy.  One of these days I will branch out because they have an extensive menu, but I will probably order the pad Thai as well because its so darn good. Plus, their prices are a downright steal.

I have really nice, friendly neighbors and one pair struck up a conversation with me because I reminded them of their daughter, and recommended Opart for Thai food near us. I've been here a couple times now and they make some pretty good food. So here's what I've had thus far: Pad lard na: skip it. It's really saucey, the noodles are drowned in the sauce. They use asian black beans in their sauce, I'm not a fan of the flavor it gave the dish. I would never order this one again.  Pad see ewe- oh yeaah they do it pretty well here. Not too dry but not too saucy for a pad see ewe and the noodles aren't all mush- they know how to handle and cook the noodles. I ordered it with beef and it was nice and tender AND this is one of the few Thai places that use chinese brocolli in their pad see ewe- no regular brocolli here, yay for effort! Lard nar talay- this is basically lard nar noodles but with seafood; shrimp, squid, and imitation crab. This is a very saucy dish but not too thick, seasoned just right. I like this dish so I've ordered it a couple times now. It can be a hit or miss. Curry fried rice- this was also pretty good but borderline getting on the salty side. We ordered this with beef and the beef was not at all dried out and chewy- yaaaay someone back in the kitchen knows how to cook. Good job. Lastly, crab rangoons- I'm usually not a fan of these things but I was with a friend that loooooves crab rangoons so we had to try Opart's rendition. It was pretty good, the pastry shell they use is a lighter version I like better and it's plump with a lot of cream cheese filling.  I've dined in and done take out here. It's my go to Thai place close to home. They have an iddy biddy parking lot that is almost always packed and annoying to try and get out of so street parking is usually the way to go, and there's plenty of it. Am I so useful or what????

A few things I've noticed: -all the bad reviews on Opart were left by people with zero friends.  Nice try, other Thai restaurants. -if you look up Thai food on Yelp, Opart has the highest rating given the quantity of reviews.

But it's so good. Not too sweet like many other places but very flavorful -Larb - great combination of ingredients that has a refreshing taste without being too heavy -Pad Kra Praow - spicy ground chicken or pork with basil - really spicy with basil, just the way I like it -Tiger Cry - super tender and flavorful appetizer - a version of Korean Kal-bi on crack with a dipping sauce to die for. -Pla Dang Rard Prick - sweet and sour fried whole snapper (need I say more?) -Curry fried rice - I love fried rice and it doesn't get much better. -Mango and sticky rice - not on the menu and available only in season.

I got the Pad Kee Mao with tofu (they call it something else here, but I was assured it was the same thing) and it was spicy, but otherwise completely bland. Vegetable spring rolls? Even blander. Fool me once... and I'm an idiot who will most likely go back again. So I did. This time I got the Pad Thai (I was previously under the impression that doing Pad Thai wrong was impossible). BUT.. the tofu pieces were measly and the whole thing made me ache afterward. I suspect that sneaky effer MSG was involved.  Oh well.

Not too much and not too little. I wasn't a big fan of the pad see ewe but it's not one of my preferred Thai dishes in general. The tofu was appetizing as well, but nothing outrageously great. We also ordered soup when we had Opart Thai for the second time and that was delicious. The restaurant decor itself was really nice, very elegant but casual as well.

It comes in this cute hot pot but they actually give you a substantial amount of soup. It's so flavorful and not like any other tom yum from other thai restaurants.

2010-05-15,1.0,"On my first night of a week long business trip to Chicago I made arrangements to meet an old friend at Opart. The restaurant was nearly empty when we arrived so we asked to be seated at a table for four since we knew we were going to order several dishes and split them and the tables for two were too small for that. The waitress was clearly irritated by it, but we were polite and thanked her for accomodating us.  We sat there for at least ten minutes before she came back to even bring us water, and tried to escape from the table when she brought it without taking our order. We caught her before she ran off and ordered an appetizer, a salad, and two entrees (although she tried to just get our appetizer and salad orders and then ""come back for the rest of your order when I bring it out""). We said no, let's order everything now and just bring the two courses first. Not sure why we had to suggest/explain this to her.  Being that we are both vegetarians we ordered the tofu satay, larb tofu, pad see ew and some other dish, both with tofu. We were busy catching up so we didn't at first notice how long it was taking for us to get our appetizer. The satay finally showed up and again, since we were busy talking, we didn't really examine the dish (didn't think we had to). I took the first bite and realized it was chicken. I was telling my friend just as she took the first bite, and her eyes got huge when she bit into it. We weren't able to catch our server's attention (this would become a theme for the rest of the meal), so we weren't able to tell her about the satay until she brought the salad. She gave a perfunctory apology and said, ""You ordered everything with tofu"" and took the plate away.  We ate the larb tofu while we waited for the satay, and the flavor was very good although the tofu was soft. I've had larb tofu at many Thai restaurants all over Washington, DC where I live and the tofu was always served semi-crispy. Also, Opart is the only Thai restaurant where the larb was served with a wedge of lettuce as opposed to sitting on a bed of lettuce. Not having knives at the table made splitting the lettuce a messy endeavor.  The tofu satay came toward the end of the larb and it looked like mozzarella sticks with peanut sauce on the side. No presentation whatsoever, and isn't the definition of ""satay"" that it is served on sticks? Unless it was dipped in the peanut sauce it had no flavor. As a side note, tofu satay is a menu item, it wasn't a substitution so one would think that it would look a little more appetizing.   Our other two dishes showed up and were put on the table without the empty plates being picked up, including our appetizer plates. Again comparing Opart to every other Thai restaurant I've been to, the place settings are usually one small plate on top of a dinner plate. Opart gives you one plate. Since our plates had peanut sauce and larb juice all over them we had to (again) make several attempts to flag her down, and when we asked for clean plates she once again made it clear that she was irritated. She brought the clean plates but still left the empty appetizer dishes and now also left the dirty appetizer plates, so our table was overrun with dishes. We tried to flag her down to come pick up the empties but since more tables had filled up and she was all the way across the restaurant at the bar talking to the other servers it was an exercise in futility.  I should say here that we were not in the slightest bit rude to her at any point during the meal. Maybe because my friend and I hadn't seen each other in so long that we didn't want our evening to become about the terrible dining experience we were having, but it's also because we're nice people who have both worked in the service industry in the past.   The pad see ew was very good. The other dish, a mixed vegetable plate with tofu, was very bland. We had ordered everything ""hot"" and the only slightly spicy dish was the larb. I had to request the spice set for the rest of it, and at first I was brought soy sauce. I've never even seen a bottle of soy sauce in a Thai restaurant before. I flagged her down (again) and asked for the rice vinegar with chilis. She brought it out but rather than the small green chilis it had sliced jalapeno peppers (!) in it. That wasn't hot enough either. She never once came to refill our water.  We finished the meal without letting the horrible dining experience put a damper on our time together. We declined dessert although I would have loved some sticky rice and mango. I just didn't want to go through what it would have taken to find the server to order it.  I'm something of a Thai food addict and I was looking forward to ordering from Opart again during my stay since I'm staying at McCormick Place and my options are limited not having a car, but my experience there last night was so bad that I am not going to risk ordering delivery from them since there's no telling what will show up",0.9514,0.882,0.066,0.052,0.48468849206349207

During my first pick order, I asked how much it would be to put pineapple in my pad thai with chicken, the lady said $1.00.  Okay, that's fine and the food despite not being spicy when I asked it to be was fine. Also the lady gave me part chicken part pineapple, which was fine with me, as she only charged me $1 and gave me less chicken.  Fast forward 2 weeks where I put in the same order.  Not only is the portion a lot smaller, there's less chicken 4 pieces of pineapple, and I get charged $3.00. ($1 for chicken and $2 for pineapple). When I called in, the lady said the person last time must have charged incorrectly, it's $1 for meat to be added to pad thai and $2 extra for anything else. Unfortunately for her, I still have the receipt which clearly marks the part pineapple part chicken and I asked last time how much it would cost.  I would have been completely fine with it if she charged me an extra $1(I wouldn't have asked for pineapple ever again being how little they gave me this time), but since she wants to charge whatever they want whenever they want, I just won't go back. Also, it's extra for no ice Thai Ice tea(which makes sorta sense as you get more liquid), but for $3, I should have just asked for less ice.  Maybe I should let it go, but I hate it when the restaurant changes what they charge on you ,without telling you. Their pad thai wasn't even that great(It's a wet version, but the noodles are clumped together) so it's really no big hardship to avoid. I think I rather go back to Yummy Thai.

2010-02-17,5.0,"I like Thai food, but a lot of places don't make it well. The flat noodles are either too thick, and clump to each other, or uncooked, or the peanut sauce is more peanuts than creamy sauce. This place was amazing. A couple of my friends got the tofu pad Thai, and that was great, but I loved the peanut sauce lover's special. The only complaint is that their notion of 'very spicy' isn't spicy. But to be fair, this is a complaint that is endemic across a lot of restaurants. I guess I need a 'Yes! I *really* can handle ultra spicy food' sticker on my forehead. We were a large group and got a bunch of shared appetizers, and sampled each others entrees. I think that usually works best because then you get to try different things and are more informed next time you come.

The catfish is cooked perfectly, with a sort of flour breading. Even though it's in a sauce it's still nice and crispy. Also, if you're a carnivore, you must order the Tiger Cry. It's morsels of beef, slightly charred on the outside but juicy and tender. Strange name, tasty dish. We came on a busy Friday night for my mom's birthday. It was a little confusing to figure out how they were seating people, but it didn't take long before we had our own little spot. Since it was mom's birthday, we indulged in a few drinks. The house drinks are a little too sweet for my taste but they are fine. (I should have just got my standard gin and tonic.) They also have the requisite Thai beers.

At the suggestion of other Yelpers, I tried the Tiger Cry, and it was excellent.  Spicy beef with nice salsa-like seasoning was awesome.  My Thai favorite, Pad Gra Prow, was also awesome, made extra spicy with the little hot red seeds with nicely ground chicken, this dish was a winner. Unfortunately, the pad thai was not so great.   The noodles were small and not flat, nowhere as supple and tasty as the since-departed VTK.  Also, the chicken chunks added to the dish were a bit too large and dry.  One more thing.  In picking  up my food, I did not receive service with a smile, but more of a ""what do you want? we have lots of customers, can't you see I'm busy?"" The girl who took my order also did not manage expectations well.  I can deal with a little longer wait to pick up my food, but when you say 20 minutes, make sure it's 20 minutes, don't make it 30.  For pickup, I always thought a restaurant aught to be conservative...if it's extra busy and it's 30, that's ok, but don't make me wait an extra 15 minutes when I get there.

We also had The Moo Ping, succulent and tangy pieces of pork on skewers which had us frothing at the mouth. For an entree baby girl and I had our world rocked by the shrimp Pad Thai and the Rama Chicken. My homegirl had the Pa Ped Pla Dook ( I love these names), the fried catfish which came with a sweet and spicy dipping sauce. The service isn't top-notch--you have to ask for things repeatedly and it's sometimes hard to understand the servers- but they are very friendly and will do what they can to accommodate you. The State Street location is very beautiful and modern, with a full bar and nice bathrooms. There's plenty of street parking and if you're lucky, you can cop a free space in the back.

Lots of straw mushrooms!) -the Tiger Cry  (When they say ""tender"" beef, they really mean it -- perfect! Love the sauce too.)   - sticky rice (I love to make little rice and Tiger Cry balls out of it.) - cucumber delight salad (Great combination of sweet and vinegar plus a jalepeno kick. Good for resetting your palette and cutting the spices in the other dishes.) - pad see-iew (This is my Thai equivalent to mashed potatoes. I order it when I just want comfort food, but I never like it sticky or bland -- theirs is neither.) - pad king (They use really fresh ginger which makes a big difference.) - pad ped tuah (I love the green beans and Thai chili in this dish.) - pad ma moung him ma pan  (The cashews and onions are nice and savory.) - gaeng keow waan (Not usually the biggest fan of green curry, but I love this one!  Eggplant, green beans, coconut milk... tasty) - gaeng gari  (Sweet potato and coconut curry, two of my favorite things in one dish.) - anything with peanut sauce! I think their portions and prices are great.  I don't want mounds of food. I want a good amount at a good value.  My favorite way to go to Opart is with a group, so we can sample a bunch of different dishes.  I can never decide on just one!  I usually like a full-bodied wine, but for Opart, we bring sweeter whites as our BYO.  Selections that we have found that pair well include: gewurtztraminer, reisling, muscado, chenin blanc , etc.  The sugars help to cut the spice in the food.   I wish I could comment on the desserts, but I have never left enough room! Note: I actually frequented both Chicago locations.  I didn't notice much of a difference in food quality, so I just chose one to post my review under.  I think the one in Lincoln Square has a little more intimate, datey vibe and it is so convenient to have the liquor store next door for BYO purchases.  I like the bright, group and family-friend vibe at the State St location too though.  Different, but both good depending on your preference.",0.9976,0.764,0.202,0.034,0.5191993464052289

Based on reviews I wanted to try the Tiger Cry (beef that melts in your mouth) and cucumber salad (a staple of mine). Both were more appetizerish but huge portions let me have left overs for the next day. My husband had the pad thai (his staple) and it too was delicious and we had leftovers of that as well. Hot jasmine tea was only a dollar and perfect for the rainy night we went on.  Prices were surprisingly less than expected for the amazing food we had.

So when I got the call that said ""Let go grab dinner, how about Thai?"", I thought twice about going out.  But all that changed when we pushed open the door of the Opart Thai House. First of all- this place is cute. Deep green ceilings and walls, painted murals along one side and light boxes on the other showcasing decorative urns, hardwood floors and dark wood tables.  Nice.  Our server took our order and soon we were drinking beer, and catching up over Shu-Mai (shrimp dumplings) and Moo Ping (pork skewers). Both were great!  For our entrees- we each ordered our own as my dining companion likes his food ""Very hot"" (they let you choose the heat level of certain dishes) and I am more of a ""plain Jane"" when it comes to Thai food.  ""Very hot"" did not describe his Penang Green Curry with beef. This dish of beef, coconut milk and basil served with rice was HOT! Yikes! Needless to say- one taste was all I needed to know it wasn't for me but he liked it. As for me- I went the safe route with Chicken Pad Thai which looked great on the plate with the peanuts, carrots and cabbage separate from the noodles and chicken. It was very good and there was enough for me to have another meal another day.  Street parking is easy on this stretch of State (pay at the box) or check out behind the restaurant. There is a sign posted on the door that there is parking back there. Service started slow but fell into place as our evening went on.  For as much food as you get, in a cute environment, this place is cheap. Dinner for two with drinks was only $37. A deal if you ask me.

I think their Crab Rangoon and sauce are good (I think the best I've ever had).  Spring Rolls are a little disappointing, but not terrible. It's just that I really love the Spring Rolls (and sauce) at Noodles in the Pot back when we lived on the Northside and haven't been able to be satisfied with others.  Make an informed decision regarding the Fried Chicken Won tons, you think it's going to something like a gyoza the way it's described, but it's really just a piece of crispy won ton with BARELY any ground chicken in a small section of it. The first time I got it I called to say I got plain fried won tons, but they said they didn't have plain wontons, so I looked closer and saw there was a little part that was supposed to be chicken.  Cucumber Salad is pretty standard, pretty delicious.  My brother loves the Thai iced tea.

I think I've had better curries elsewhere, but they are still pretty good. They come with rice and sometimes I wish they had a noodle option. I always get an extra order of rice, too, b/c there's always extra curry leftover with just the one rice it comes with. Peanut Sauce Lover's Chicken is also very good.  Curry Fried Rice is also very delicious.  PORTION comment: noodle dishes are slightly smaller than other Thai places, but good with the Crab Rangoon (I think there are 8). Also, we always get an extra order of rice whenever we get curry.  DELIVERY tips: if you want Thai hot sauce, you must ask for it or you won't get it. If you want chopsticks also, you must ask for it.",0.9986,0.74,0.25,0.01,0.5822804232804235

2009-05-03,3.0,"3.5 stars for both dine in and delivery. Both experiences were delicious. I've pretty much come to terms with prices for Thai food. For a while I felt Thai food overall in Chicago was overpriced. I was always comparing it to similar dishes that can be gotten in Chinese restaurants in Chinatown.  The couple of curries I've gotten when I dined in seemed a bit on the small side. I think they look smaller than usual because there are no filler veggies. The noodle and rice dishes seem larger, especially for the price. The spiciness level is adjustable and unless you like super spicy, lean on the careful side. I usually go for medium and it's pretty darn spicy.   + Tiger Cry $6.95: Tender, good char, and flavorful.  + Curry fried rice with beef $5.95: Solid curry flavor, great with the beef. + Catfish with red curry $12.95: The sauce was amazing but the catfish seemed a tad too breaded and over fried. Luckily the sauce soaked into the fish.  + Pad Thai with chicken $6.95: The sauce the noodles were cooked in was delicious. I could have gone for a bit more red cabbage and some fresh bean sprouts. I usually like this dish with a noodle that is flatter and a bit wider. The chicken breast could have been a little moister. However, I still liked the dish.  Overall: This place is consistently good and pretty reasonably priced.  We had 1 app, 1 noodle dish, 1 rice dish and 1 entree plus delivery and tip = $44.",0.9916,0.802,0.184,0.014,0.5588235294117648

The staff is really friendly.  It seems to be the same three girls every time we go.  They are nice and all good servers.  It seems the very few bad reviews on this place reference terrible service.  We have been here many, many times and never experienced that.  There is one server that is not the happiest lady but knows how to do her job.  The place has a full bar and a 'Sangria' type special drink which isn't bad.

Mild is mild and hot is HOTTT, but medium ranges in between and skews towards hot.  Their hot is much hotter than most Americanized restaurants. Design/Decor: ** Because there are no booths, dividers, or private spaces, the single room feels a bit like a cafeteria.  The chairs are tiny and uncomfortable (typical for many restaurants).  Dim the lights, install a few comfy booths (perhaps elevated a step or two), and add ambient music to make it cozier. Service: ** Food arrives quickly and the servers are normally pleasant, but they can be inattentive even when idle.  (Keep my water glass filled, and when I ask for water, fill all the glasses on the table!)

My one complaint is that there is no appetizer sized tom yum soup!  I don't need 9 bucks worth of soup.  I don't have a fridge.  Way to make me feel lonely!  JK.  But I did want some soup and they said ""no soup for youuu"" I combed a ton of menus -- my choices seemed to be deep fried catfish or a whole snapper.  EEEW, I don't like fried and i don't like bones.  I just wanted a stir fried white fish.  So, I ordered the  Pad Kra Praow Pla- Sauteed sole fish with Thai basil and Thai hot peppers.  Well, it wasn't spicy AT ALL.  And I asked for it spicy.  Maybe I didn't sound like I could take the heat.  AND the fish was definitely fried and not sauteed.  But whatever, my rice noodles soaked up that greasy fish and sauce really nicely and it was all yummy in my tummy.  I'll sleep like a baby.  In fact, I'll probably order the same thing tomorrow night, but order it pet pet and see what happens.   My delivery came super fast....I was actually wandering around looking for some kind of uncaffeinated beverage when the delivery guy called me.  I had my food within 20-30 mins, not the 45 quoted.  Which is awesome, because it was still hot!  Wooo hot food.

During the entire meal, no one came by to check up on us.  The staff was too caught up in trying to close up to provide proper service.  At the end of the night, I finally realized why the server ignored our request for separate checks.  She raped us on gratuities with a whopping 20%.  Having worked numerous years in the hospitality industry, I understand charging gratuities for larger parties.  HOWEVER, I think it was pretty damn presumptuous to charge 20% (when you provide service that deserves 10%). I'm not a cheapskate - I tip 15% for shitty service, 20% for good, and 25% for great service.  But the tribe has spoken, even though the server didn't deserve it, she would get her much undeserved tip - albeit $0.76 short of her projected figures.  But she actually had the gall to come yell at us about being shorted $0.76.  This is where we had a much heated (at least on her end) and very entertaining (on my end) debate about proper restaurant etiquette and the rocket science of proper gratuities charges.  ""I punched it in the computer and it came out 18%""  Quite the genius this one - 18% charge POST TAX (W-T-F).
