You won't be coming here for ambiance or service, but you will come here and be coming back for the unique Nyarit-style (spicy!!) seafood. Like other reviews detail, it's a cramped, simple joint that serves big, bold flavors. I recommend not getting distracted by the appetizers and just focus on the massive platters.  As to not be repetitive, here's some brief highs and lows of the food:  HIGHS: -complimentary ceviche tostada -habanero sauce (not the one in the bottle, but the homemade one)  -Horchata (perfect beverage to cool you down) -platters (crab legs, Charola Mixta) come in ginormous portions and punchy flavors LOWS: -shrimp cocktail was watery and flavorless -fish ceviche (still delicious, but the same mixture that's on the complimentary tostada) All in all, I've been consistently blown away by this place.

At first, we were seated at a real small table and my date and I both looked at each other like ""this ain't gonna work!!"" We knew we were going to order the combo platter and it would.

One night, I had family stop by during a long layover at O'Hare and we decided to check it out. There were only three of us. Yet, we decided to order the Famosa Mariscada (which feeds about 4-5 people) because we have huge appetites. The waiter warned us that we're getting a massive amount of food. While we were waiting, they brought us ceviche to start. The ceviche was pretty good so we figured the actual main course would be better. We were wrong. Everything on the platter was mediocre at best. The breaded shrimp were salty, the bacon wrapped shrimp were either pre-cooked and then microwaved to reheat or over cooked.  Either way, it was bland and chewy. The lobster was lacking flavor. The fishes were alright. Don't even get me started on the spicy shrimp and whatever else was mixed in the seafood (Chapuzon Del Mar??). We ended up taking two HUGE trays of leftovers home (and gave it to our friends). They didn't like it either. Additionally, while we were waiting for our food, an unsupervised little girl (around 3-4 years old) was wandering around, while licking the top of a shaker, and just eyeing other patrons from table to table. GROSS! Saw that salt shaker put back on the table next to ours. The platter (at ""market price"") + 3 sodas turned out to be $175. Joe's Crab Shack would've been a better choice!

He gave us great recommendations and was back to check on us regularly.  We ordered the 2-3 persons seafood platter (prawns, dungeness crab, lobster, potatoes, rice) we also got octopus, and mussels. everything was amazing, the seafood was so fresh and tasty, the sauce probably has some crack in it bc its so good and addictive.

That is one of their known dishes and we usually order them whenever we go but this time they were over salty and we couldn't enjoy as many as we liked.  The fried snapper is usually good as well. It this time we ordered it with a sauce on top and it just ruined the taste of the fish and the crunchy deep fried skin. The same sauce that made the longostinos salty made this sauce salty as well.  The cocktail we ordered was the best dish of the night and it was prepared fantastically. I wish we could have just had that cocktail and it would have made the night great.

I get it it's not their table but it's the rude way that they responded that was annoying and has me upset.  You would have thought that I was asking for something free or asking for a kidney. I had a $150 dollar bill and still left them 18% so it was $177 total. Yes even with the horrible service  I still left a tip.

I have heard about this place before and our friend recently shared their page on FB showing all their seafood they were cooking up in the kitchen and we thought it was time to give it a try. We are both seafood lovers, so our expectations were pretty high. When we arrived, we didn't realize how small the place was. We noticed servers going upstairs, so unsure of how much room is up there, but from the looks of the downstairs, it's hard to come with with a big group. First, you get some fish civeche, complimentary, with some house salsa. It was decent, the salsa was super spicy! I can handle spice, but boy, that made my eyes water. We didn't know what to get, so we ordered some variety seafood items. When it came, it definitely made a scene. These group of ladies stopped our server so they can take a picture of it! As the server headed towards our table, I seriously was hoping that didnt belong to us because that was way too much food for just two people. I noticed each seafood item had a different taste to each of its sauce. One was more garlicy, one was more spicy, and one was more of seafood flavors. So what I did was peel my seafood and dip it I my favorite sauce before eating it.  The one star is missing from a 5 Star rating because I thought every seafood item we got was overcooked to my liking. You can tell because it was was more rubbery and hard.

My friend went with the grilled chicken that came with cheese quesadillas, rice, salad and fresh guacamole. Both dishes were fresh and cooked to perfection that came to table pipping hot.

Cliff notes: This is the worst quality seafood I have had in my entire life and the worst food I have ever eaten in Chicago.  DO. NOT. BELIEVE. THE. HYPE. I don't think yelp has ever steered me this wrong. I came here tonight for my friend's birthday. We ordered the Alegras Special which was supposed to be an assortment of shellfish with garlic bread, rice, french fries, and salad. This was supposed to serve two. What arrived was a platter, so large it could have easily fed four, that was a mixture of OLD (smiley, mushy, stange smelling) cold lobster that was stuffed with what looked like lo mein. Inside the lo mein stuffing was INTENSELY overcooked shrimp and octopus. Everything else on the plate was also very cold the crab smelled like it had turned...I kind of got the impression that this food was leftover from Friday night and they reheated it for us (Today is Monday). They also only served us rice  and salad and not any garlic bread. The best part of the meal was the rice. Never in my life have I left seafood on a plate! Tonight we both left 95% of this ginormous platter on the plate and left feeling dirty. They basically served us trash. Also, the worst part it was $119 (which we found out after we ordered). NEVER AGAIN. This is not a good deal and this is not good seafood. I really should have sent this food back, but my friend is super mild mannered and I did not want to make a scene on his birthday. The experience was so bad that my friend felt bad for me and  he insisted on paying for the meal even though I had been planning to cover the tab since it was his day.

As for our Entree, we took our servers suggestion and ordered the Camarones Huicholes with a side of fries. We sat waiting for out entree to arrive for a prolonged period of time. When it finally arrived, it was delivered solo without our side of fries that we ordered; which then also took another 5-10 minutes to arrive to our table. Again, portion size was more then generous, but as far as flavor....we were very disappointed by the recommendation given to us. The shrimp were very dry. We suspected that they could have been sitting underneath a heat lamp too long which could have overcooked them. Not only were the shrimp dry and not enjoyable, but the veins were left in them which is unsightly and adds an unpleasant grittiness to each bite. We joked to each other as we polished off our plate of fries stating that they were the highlight of our meal.  The server noticed that we hadn't touched our entree and asked if we everything was OK. My boyfriend (who is Spanish speaking) explained to her that we did not care for her recommendation. She was very apologetic (is what I was told).

I've been working in service and hospitality for a decade now and the number 1 cardinal rule in this industry is to make sure that people leave happy (and full). Paying full price for something that we barely touched and didn't enjoy left a bad taste in our mouths (literally and figuratively).  On top of of being charged full price on our tab, they charged my boyfriends card the wrong amount and had to go back and fix it (which is still overcharged by $5).

2016-05-29,4.0,"Taste could be better but the portion size was very big. It's a one of the best value seafood in Chicago. I went there with 5 more friends. We ordered Langostinos Estilo Nayarit (Prawn), Filete Perla (Fish with seafood on top), and Alegrias Special (mixed seafood platter). These were enough for 6 people (with 2 people ate a lot less than others), and we paid about $34 each. It took some time for the food to arrive. Luckily, they had a free appetizer which is a minced seafood on a tostada. It's good. But I wish there's be more flavor. The dishes that we ordered were good too. I like the sauce in Langostinos Estilo Nayarit (Prawn) but it was overcooked and a bit cold when they arrived. The Filete Perla was different. It is like a fish with tasty seafood on top. The Alegrias Special was very special indeed. It consisted of 3 main parts, the prawn (just like above), stuff lobster tail, and crab legs. The lobster tail's stuffing was similar to the fish dish that we got. But the way they prepare was very different. It was more spicy here. I really like this one. The crab leg is good, but I think it's not as fresh as well like it to be. Also I think the sauce was just salt. The service can be slow, but the servers are very friendly. It can get loud inside because most tables were large groups, so you can try to sit at their patio. One of the alternative to this could be the Asian Cajun or the Angry Crab. P.S.

That's ok though, I gave my friend the garlic bread that came with my shrimp fajitas (along with rice and french fries).  I worked in restaurants for years, so I am generally extremely forgiving for off service or a not-so-great meal.  But this was an outstanding display of terrible service and equally bad food.  Good luck guys, hope you get your sh*t together, but I'll never be back.",0.9965,0.723,0.191,0.086,0.5043231074481075

Langostinos Estilo Nayarit aka Prawns Nayarit Style.  The sauce again makes this and the prawns have a nice crunch to them.  We got a full tray yesterday (12).  They look large but this they go quickly.  They are not that large after you remove the shells so if you're looking to get full, probably not worth the order.  Very tasty though. 4.)

The reason for our negative experience is principally due to what we think is a shady business practice we felt like we had been prey to. You can read my appraisal of the actual food, service, and ambience below. I came with a party of 12 other medical students to celebrate a friend's birthday. Our waitress told us that we should order a platter that was designed for 10 people, ""although it will feed 12 just fine."" She did not tell us the price or point to the cost on the menu (although retrospectively, I see that the menu simply says ""Market Price"" for many of the platters, which further obfuscates what the cost will be).  Although we certainly share blame for not asking our waitress how much it would be, we couldn't help but be appalled by the food we got and the price. There is no way a party of 10 or 12 could finish the platter (our party was not a push-over in terms of eating ability). This platter could have comfortably filled 20. We were shocked to see our bill was over 600 dollars. In my mind, I can't imagine that an individual in most parties of ten would be okay with paying over 60 dollars for a meal here. (I'll upload a photo of the meal so you can judge for yourself if my concerns are valid, and I will discuss below the actual food quality). At most I could imagine our meal deserved 30 dollars per person (and I would begrudgingly consent to that). I didn't want to make a scene at the restaurant but called thirty minutes after leaving to speak with a manager; they told me to leave my contact info and the owner would call back. Shortly afterwards the manager called back and simply told me they would offer a discount for my next visit. I don't care much for the discount, I simply wanted to talk about this business practice because I felt it was unfair. While the female manager I talked to validated my concerns and told me she too felt it this was an unreasonable price and practice. However, she did not respond to my concerns that this would happen to customers again -- and if you peruse Yelp, you will find I am not the first customer to raise this serious concern. She simply said I should call back before my next visit, and I would get a discount. (As an aside, she was unable to tell me what the discount would be -- only that it will depend on what I order. I can't help but mention how useless that is. Even if the discount is 50%, as I wrote above, that would really not be worth it for anyone in my party, personally. And who knows what the discount would be, we'd have to order before knowing?? I certainly can't make use of this otherwise good-willed gesture). The call was pleasant enough though. Congratulations for winning a star back. Ultimately, we felt cheated, like the waitress had pushed this order on us and we ended up being prey to arbitrary pricing. As for the actual restaurant and food, we were seated in extremely cramped quarters (I literally had to crawl under my table to use the bathroom -- we were abutting another table directly, and there was no way to squeeze through). The tables are cheap and covered with a plastic wrap. Our cups were small white styrofoam, and we served ourselves our own water out of a pitcher. The plates were cheap and light with antiquated design, sort of like grandma's plates. Some of the plates were styrofoam. Really, this is all par for the course for a seafood restaurant with this sort of overall atmosphere, so I'm not upset about it specifically. But it does directly conflict with the price tag of our platter, which would make you think like this was some sort of Michelin starred high-end dining experience. The food itself is certainly not bad. Somewhat overseasoned, but some people like that. The fried fish was dry and uncharacteristically underseasoned compared to the rest of the meal. The shrimp were quite overcooked, but when eating at an en-masse seafood restaurant like this where everything is cooked relatively together in tin-foil, it's to be expected. Again, it is simply not commensurate with the price, and I would caution people eating here.",0.9886,0.838,0.103,0.059,0.42845405767940975

The tostadas were a nice touch over traditional chips and salsa, which was also offered and delivered. Made with habanero peppers, the salsa is sure to please any ""chili liker.""

Madeleine ordered the shrimp in Nayarit sauce, and I took the plunge with the hot Diablo sauce. This was a great meal for $13+tax. A good portion of shrimp and well-prepared accompanying sides.

A large horchata to share (or two if you don't intend to share) 2. the Mojarra, in the Nayarit style (I am 90% sure this is Tilapia, but if it's going to bother you if it isn't then you should look it up) This will be sufficient, unless you are very hungry, in which case you can order something else additional. When the platter comes to your table, it is HUGE. A single platter takes up a full two-person table. The fish in the Nayarit style is soaked in Nayarit sauce, which I would buy on its own. It's a great combination of spices that is flavorful and yet somehow not too spicy (unlike the salsa that they bring you before the meal, which should carry a warning). Don't forget to eat the fish cheek (it is fatty and delicious, sort of like pork belly), and don't forget to flip it over and eat the other side. They bring out a ceviche on a chip for you as an appetizer before your meal, and it is good but a little dry; the salsa, as I mentioned, is terrifyingly hot and I like spice. If you are going to eat that salsa, make sure you have horchata on hand. When it comes down to it, though, criticisms aside, for all of this food you pay something like $15, and it is a TON of food, and it is very satisfying. A whole fish! Who wouldn't be satisfied. I also think that this is a variation on the typical Mexican restaurant. Their focus on seafood is commendable and makes everything more interesting. ***They did get our bill wrong at the end, so double check before handing over your card. ***Outdoor seating available.",0.9921,0.825,0.135,0.039,0.5690759637188209

WARNING (and I wish someone had told me): they give you a shrimp salad/ ceviche taco once you sit. With it comes another salad in a little bowl that looks extremely deceiving. You're supposed to put some of that onto your taco and then eat. It was INSANELY SPICY- like biting into a whole habanero pepper. Pretty much close-up- your throat kind of spicy- which can be really dangerous for a first-comer. My mouth, throat, tongue was burning - and I eat lots of spicy food. The food WAS delicious, but some warning to a few non-ethnic customers would have been appreciated since we had to ask help with the menu which was mostly in Spanish.

While everyone were waiting near the kitchen entrance, it was very tempting to see all the huge plates waitresses carried out every other minute. The smell from the kitchen was also very nice. Finally, we were seated on the second floor, which we didn't realize they had one. We ordered a small order of snow crab legs, a 7 sea soup, and the Chapuzon de Mar, which is a mix of octopus, oyster and shrimp. The food finally came after about 20 minutes. So right away we started working on the seafood mix and the soup. Right away I can tell I'm very disappointed. The soup taste like they just put different varieties of seafood all in with water and some vegi. The worst thing is the crab leg was COLD. It got cold after 5 minutes. That's ridiculous. Two of us paid $100 including tips. And this is the most disappointing $100 meal I ever had. All I can say is they look better than they taste.",-0.5709,0.876,0.055,0.069,0.6819727891156463

The food came with a ceviche-topped tostada, which had I known I probably wouldn't have ordered a separate ceviche. However, the shrimp ceviche was amazing. It was super fresh and had plenty of shrimp. The crab and the prawns were in this amazing sauce that was so good I wanted to drink it.

We were still charged, we mentioned it and they took it off the bill no problem. It happens. They tend to bring out whatever is ready - so we received the crab legs, than the prawns 10 mins later. No big deal since we were all sharing, but could be frustrating if people order individual entrees.

But it was good, also the complimentary marlin tostada is excellent. Real sauces are available, be careful with the green sauce on a bowl . Great service and  friendly staff. Everything is clean. Parking in the street is easy. Cons: Not significant ones really. Well I did get a bit disturbed by a live lobster whose arm was off and laying by itself in the center of the tank.

2014-07-28,3.0,"3.5 but had to choose 3.  Went  with a date Friday night. We were both looking forward to it based on the stellar Yelp reviews. Here's how the night went:  It was pretty average temps outside for a summer day but if you don't have AC going indoors during a day like that, you'll be sweating balls of fire. We walked in and immediately walked out. It was a fire pit in there, like literally take out marshmallows and chocolate because it was burning up. Fack!  We opted to sit outside instead. I'm on low carb and couldn't drink but I know my date wanted to have a few . Once we sat outside and were attended to, we were told there was no alcohol allowed in the outdoor seating area. Wtf?  Anyways, fast forward to the food.... The first thing they bring out for your table as an app/pre-course is crunchy tortillas and six random mussels. I guess it's their version of bread ? It was odd. Good but odd.  We ordered the grilled seafood mixture of shrimp, oysters, and octopus (pulpo). It was really good. Too spicy for this Cuban's taste buds, but good nonetheless. It doesn't come with any sides so it was just a giant plate of protein. If I ever go back, I will NOT be on my low carb diet and order rice to go with it. I'm sure it would've been a hundred times better with the seafood. My date was a gentleman by not tempting me with fattening sides and patient with the no drinking thing but he seemed to have been pleased with the main course too. The service was definitely a cluster F. Slower than una tortuga pero bueno, patience is key at these small joints, I guess.  So consensus is: hot as shit inside, no alcohol outside, carb-y sides a must.  Try it out. Still the best seafood option I've found in U Village.",0.8997,0.781,0.12,0.098,0.47921146953405025

When I lived in Ukrainian Village, we often went to Mariscos for red snapper, fish tacos, crab legs, and the delicious seasoned fries. We happened to be in the neighborhood, so we stopped in to check out our formerly 5-star favorite Mexican seafood place after too long of an absence. Our experience was surprising. The name on the menu is now different, all of the smiling pictures are off the walls, and the staff is no longer helpful. I'm surprised that the Yelp page is totally the same, honestly, because it seems like the restaurant is under new management or something (and it shows). The service was atrocious. I ordered a bottle of coke that never came (had to ask twice) and when the meal was over, we waited 10 minutes to receive our check after flagging down the waiter, and then he never came back with our change that we asked him for. We had to find him downstairs after waiting another 10 minutes.  The atmosphere is also very different, especially in the upstairs room. The room they had us seated in was nearly empty, no furniture no people etc. It smelled like a hamster cage and the other table in the room, a group of obnoxious college kids, was so loud that it was hard for us to hold a conversation at our own table without raising our voices. It was just a very weird place to eat dinner.  And the food -- the red snapper was still cooked very well, but the fish in my tacos and my fries were not so well done. There also didn't seem to be enough sauce on the snapper, which is quite frankly the best part!  The fries were soggy and darkly colored--someone needs to clean the fryer it seems. Just a disappointment and not what we're used to at this restaurant. We'll not be heading back. It's just not the same place anymore and we were very disappointed. Mariscos used to be a stand by that was consistently good with great service to match the delicious food. We're going to have to find a replacement now!",0.99,0.766,0.154,0.081,0.5154315886134069

It's sad how much I was actually looking forward to this place having heard how amazing the food is. Time: 8:30PM Date: Saturday, May 17th Party: 2 I don't even know where to begin...My guest and I walked in around 8:30 and waited in line with 2 other couples.

We were so fortunate enough to be seated at a misplaced table tucked near the back which could have been easily mistaken for the supply table where the napkins, cups, and utensils were stacked. Upon being seated, we were promptly served chips and salsa even before our menus were provided. If only our food came out as fast as those chips and salsa, but it was a whole another story. Our order was taken probably 10 mins later than the other 2 couples and all by the same waitress might I add. We ordered the ceviche, empanadas, and the crab legs. I don't know about you but ceviche shouldn't even take that long, but it never came... More than 30 mins have elapsed as I watched the food arrive at the other 2 tables of the couples we arrived with. I decided to mention something to our waitress that we have been sitting here for quite some time if you could please check on our food. She quickly defensively stated how busy they were and that she would check on it. 10 mins have gone by and our waitress CLEARLY sees us just sitting there eying her, but she didn't seem to want to make eye contact with us at this point. By then I was pretty upset, I mentioned to one of the serves that we have been sitting here for almost 45 mins now with no food out yet. He looked puzzled and concerned, which was the look I was hoping for, and quickly looked up our order. NOTHING WAS IN THE SYSTEM! OUR ORDER WAS NEVER ENTERED!!! He then grabs our waitress to express our concern and the situation. Again she was defensive and begins to go on and on about how it is the kitchen's fault.

They've raised some of the menu prices since my visit half a year ago.  A tray of crab legs used to be 6 sets for $40.  But NOW it's 5 sets for $46, and 10 sets for about double that price. Overall food is still fantastic in quality & quantity.  I knocked down a star since it was so cold in here.  I was here on a 20 degree night, and it seemed like they didn't have any heating on.  I was still shivering while I had on a heavy sweater and down-filled jacket, and sitting in the corner furthest from the doors.  Maybe some better insulation for their set of doors?",0.9743,0.886,0.114,0.0,0.5046825396825396

My dad wanted to try something new, and both my parents wanted seafood. So I called ahead of time thinking that's the responsible thing to do. So I called. It was kind of loud in the background. I asked the young man who worked there if they took reservations. He said only in larger groups. Cool. So I asked if the restaurant might be busy later, since it was Valentine's Day. That's a pretty good question to ask I though. He said he wasn't sure; he had to wait till later. Okay. All this sounds reasonable, right? Well here's the problem; this person was very short with me. It was as if he was exceedingly annoyed that I was calling. He seemed in a huge hurry to get off the phone.  Okay. I understand that you're busy; I'm an understanding kind of girl. But if it's THAT busy, then tell me that! That was my whole point for calling. To ask that very question. I wanted to know if it's too busy for my mother, who gets uncomfortable in certain situations in restaurants.  I WANTED to give this restaurant my money instead of sending my parents to Red Lobster. But I was very put off by my phone conversation. Then he hung up after I said ""Oh okay."" No bye, or thank you for calling. If that's how a phone conversation goes, I'd rather wait to send my parents somewhere they've never been and their server will be the same way. Hoping that this year, I get to go and actually taste their food.  TL;DR VERSION Phone conversation; Person was very short with me and was not helpful. I was planning a special occasion.

2014-02-09,5.0,"Mariscos El Veneno is unarguably my wife's favorite restaurant in Chicago, and second place is so far in the dust that Usain Bolt is wondering how far back that sucker done be.  As for me, I'm in a love-hate relationship with their complementary salsa. It's quite possibly the best thing I've ever eaten that sets my mouth ablaze, and despite the quarter quell brewing in my stomach, I gobble bite after bite down. There was a short-lived show on Food Network called Heat Seekers with fun Aaron Sanchez (not that button-downed dude on Chopped) I used to love. I would have paid Aaron and his partner in crime Roger Mooking good money to down this sauce. I'm drooling just typing it. Oh, but back to the wife. Her bag is the Crab Legs Nayarit, a heapful of crab clusters (expect 5 to 6 per plate) doused in a Nayarit sauce that looks spicy but tastes quite mild. It's an absolute steal for just under $40, and easily shareable by two people. Once you break off a big piece of crab, dip that sucker in the sauce, and sprinkle a little of the aforementioned salsa atop. It's like a little bite of heaven. I also recommend a side of rice, which tastes excellent on its own but is simply delightful with some sauce dripped on top. The food is finger-lookin' good, and it's not limited to the crab. The prawns (langoustines are sliced in half and are just as highly recommended. Although we always go crab, I won't lie: my eyes have strayed. An octopus dish is calling my name, if only I could get my wife to indulge, and other dishes like the whole fried snapper and pineapple bake look equally amazing. If you're salivating right now or dying of salsa burn later, Mariscos El Veneno has the horchata or Mexican Coke and Jarritos to quench that thirst. Of course, the cherry on top is that it's also BYOB, meaning you should most definitely get that six-pack or wine bottle chilling in the back of your fridge. A top-notch michelada order is available; me, I prefer the horchata. The place gets packed in peak hours, but service is fast and friendly.

The shrimp was delicious, but we paid almost $1 a shrimp, which is ridiculously expensive.  The fish was extra dry and lacking in flavor.  The chilled soup appetizer thing was supposed to be octopus + shrimp, but instead, we got raw oysters that tasted kinda funky with shrimp in this cold tomato based soup thing.  The fries were fried in the same oil as the fish, so tasted fishy.  In general, the food was severely underwhelming while priced on the level of some of the places on Milwaukee.  Instead, the staff speaks next to zero English, the restaurant the decor of a cheap takeout spot, and the food is just not that great.  I don't understand why there are always so many people here, but I won't be back.",-0.8897,0.873,0.034,0.093,0.40497481684981684

2013-06-12,3.0,"Mexican Seafood. It's a thing. Its gotta be, there are several places around town like this. The menus are the same and you usually come for the crab legs or the snapper. There are no tacos There are no beans. There's definitely no cheese. There's seafood. And that's it.   I guess you either love it or you hate it. Or, like me, you're somewhere in the middle. I love seafood, but I also love a well-rounded menu. In an attempt to order appetizers for my table, I quickly realized the only options were either shrimp emanadas (p.s. they were bland and dry) or shrimp tostadas that they bring out as an amuse (I use that term insanely loosely) anyway for all guests.  So, basically, you are really there to order an entree, eat that and leave.  It's no frills and that's cool, but lemme tell ya, the crab is WORK. Real work. Peeling, cracking, digging, sucking and then repeating all of those steps for what seems like an eternity, for teeny, weeny, meeny pieces of crab.  It's kind of exhausting. But delicious. But exhausting.  I'm still not sure it's worth it. King crab legs, pre-cracked, aside drawn butter and fwantzy lemon in that little cheesecloth thingy seemed like Mecca after this.  Take me to Mecca. Oh!  And be warned: the salsa they bring you with the complimentary chips is really just glorified habanero juice.  My mouth was en fuego for 6.5 hours after eating it.

If you're a crab fan, do not pass go and do not collect $200.  Just order ""the crab legs.""  Don't even bother with the rest of the menu.  I'm telling you, you won't be disappointed.  Actually, you may be disappointed if you're searching the menu for tacos and quesadillas.  They don't serve that.  It's strictly a seafood affair. What was delivered to the table was arguably the most obscene amount of huge, luscious, steaming hot crab legs (still attached to huge knuckles) swimming in a spicy, butter sauce.  You're given a prehistoric leg cracking device and a plastic basket.   You dive in. You start groaning uncontrollably because this crab is the shizzle. I'm not going to kid you: Eating monstrous crab legs is no easy task.  It's a lot of work to get to that sweet meat.  But it's kind of fun.  Consider it a food adventure.   Then you pay your laughably cheap bill of like, $39.99 for this entire plate of crab.  You retreat to your home where you take a full-body shower to get all of the crab juice and such off your body.  I found crab shells in my bra.  I had smears of butter sauce on my thighs.  Definitely found some spots of crab meat on my shoes.  It's a totally messy affair.   Do it.   Oh, and did I mention it's BYOB and they don't laugh at you and your party for bringing in a case of Coors Light?",0.9304,0.795,0.127,0.078,0.6226010101010101

2013-04-04,5.0,"Drrrroooooooooooooooo [pause] oooooooooool! There's not too many restaurants that I visit 4 times in the span of 2 weeks.  But Mariscos El Veneno definitely is one of those places.  You walk into this small establishment and it is always crowded during their dinner service.  I've been there on different days of the week and there's always a good amount of people dining.Their decor reminds me of the ocean with little knick-knacks hanging from the wall and ceiling.  It has a very chill and laid back atmosphere.  They have live music on a regular basis, but not every night.  Fridays during Lent can get rather crowded with wait times up to 30-45 minutes.  They do have an upstairs section that they open during these busy periods.  On to the good stuff... Crab Legs - Holy smokes, Batman!  Dare I say the BEST crab legs ever?  The crab is cooked so perfectly often times you don't need the crab cracker to get into these bad boys.  The crab meat is always so juicy and tender, never rubbery or mushy.   Langostines Nayarit - This whole Nayarit business that they have going on here is amazing.  The langostines are cooked perfectly.  Tender and full of flavor.  There's so much going on with the Nayarit sauce that they submerge and pour over the langostines.   Capuzon Del Mar -  Crack.  Yes, like crack cocaine.  This dish is super addicting.  Before you know it, you have eaten the entire dish.  The seafood in this dish, octopus, shrimp, and oysters.  It is truly a dip in the sea!  The flavor is so impactful in this dish.  The various types of seafood in this dish add different layers and textures to the already amazing sauce.  Tip: Add some of this to your salad.  You won't regret it.   Red Snapper - Huge. Ginormous.  They don't cheat you when you order the fried red snapper.  As always, throw some Nayarit sauce on it and you're set.  The fish is fried nicely and to your specifications.  The flavor is always amazing and the fish is already tasty by itself without any Nayarit sauce.   Tilapia - Very very very good!  Unfortunately the red snapper outshines it in my opinion.  The fish is cooked really nicely and the price point is on point!  Stuffed Fish Filet - This dish was good, but there was a little too much going on.  Everything was cooked nicely and had a nice flavor, but the cheese on the dish seems to overpower and mask a lot of the flavors that they have going on. 7 Seas Soup - It was good, but a little on the disappointing side.  When I think of a traditional Seven Seas Soup, I think of an overwhelming amount of seafood pouring out of the bowl.  There was a very modest amount of seafood to be found in the bowl.  The flavor was okay, but there is so much more they could have done with the soup.  Perhaps we came in on an off day, but I'll definitely have to retry it. Their habanero salsa is amazing.  Such great spice, hotness and flavor!  Add it to any dish to enhance the spice.  If you don't like spice, just add the tiniest amount or just simply stay away from it because it will definitely burn your mouth.  Don't forget to add an horchata to your order as well.  It's so delicious and definitely hits the spot.  It also cools down your mouth nicely. The staff is always super friendly and helpful.  They tend to be a little slow with refilling your water glass, but if you get their attention they will be right there to help you. I have no idea what exactly comprises the Nayarit flavor, but I am absolutely obsessed with it.  Come in a group and share your food!  This way you get to experience more of the deliciousness that comes from their kitchen.   #hellaYUMMS",0.9994,0.762,0.215,0.023,0.5873283198283199

What I didn't appreciate was that they weren't really accommodating. It was disappointing. They had the tables set for only 16 people and when I asked the server for more chairs, he simply looked around the room and said there were no more chairs available. When I looked around the room, there was a 4 top not being utilized. My cousin and I grabbed the chairs ourselves. Not to mention, for the size of the party, we were short about 2 tables. It seemed like everyone was rubbing elbows and knees. Why take a reservation for 20 people if you're not going to accommodate the whole party?  As far as the food is concerned, my cousin and I ordered the platter of langoustines ""nayarit"" style. We received about 8 langoustines, halved and baked. And although the flavor was there, they were overcooked and overpriced. Not worth $5.00 a langouistine ($40.00 plattter). We also ordered 2 sides of rice. The amount of money paid and the amount of food that was received, it just wasn't worth it.

Yes, I realize that this is the third review today in which I've stated that, but it's true for each restaurant for different reasons and it would be unfair to quantify that title conditionally.  Better to just state flat out that it's the best and use the subsequent sentences to explain myself.  How the only two Mexican seafood restaurants I've ever known ended up right across the street from each other is beyond me, but make sure you go to this one.  Mariscos El Veneno:El Barco::A Bug's Life::Antz.  They're both Mexican Seafood Restaurants/cartoons about bug's but they are not equals. Mariscos El Veneno goes through waves of popularity.  There have been Thursdays when the wait is an hour and a half long and Saturdays when there is no wait at all.  Obviously the opposite is the more likely scenario, but I'm trying to highlight that how busy the place is seems to be independent of any pattern I can decipher.  But it doesn't take reservations so you should at least prepare to wait. The food is outstanding.  Before you even order they will give you a delicious tostado with ceviche and a bowl of the hottest dern salsa you've ever tried. The menu is in English and Spanish, but they chose to only translate the names, and not the descriptions, so you're still forced to ""translate"" what such things as ""Nayarit style"" is. You should order at least one Stuffed Lobster for your table.  Just point to the picture on the back of the menu.  It seems to range in price, I've paid anywhere from 30 to 65 dollars for it, but it easily feeds 2 and even at the top of that scale, it's a bargain.  Also get at least one order of Mummy shrimp.  The main guy will try to talk you out of it, but don't listen to him.  It's Shrimp wrapped in bacon with some cheese in the middle.  Unshockingly, they are delicious.  Also every meal comes with rice, some salad and fries.  The salad is just some lettuce, a tomato wedge and zero dressing but both the fries and rice are surprisingly good.

Don't be afraid to pop your bottles or cans in any corner of this place and relax while you wait So with that aside this place was well worth everything I endured and described above. Everyone here was fantastic and most accomodating while we waited and during our meal. The food that kept passing us looked delicious and smelled wonderful. The portions were huge and the people were eating like there was tomorrow. I am way excited to see what all this fuss is about. Susana was our waiter and she did not disappoint. Originally, we all were going to order this and that and then the birthday girl decided to ask for recommendations for the table and she offered up some favorites and recommended we waited to order anything else because it was a ton of food. She also said she didn't want us to be full before the mains came out. Talk about service! Before we ordered, they brought out these tortillas wth ceviche and the habernero salsa. I am not sure how I did not know about this beforehand, but this stuff is SPICCYYYYY. It had people at our table in tears and fits of coughing. Both were quite tasting and a nice start since by this time my insides were turning in on themselves. So we ordered the following items: Crab Legs Nayarit Style (crab in a Mexican red sauce of spicy tangy) -  hands down some of the best crab I've ever had. I mean it was fresh, steamed to perfection. I get all excited just thinking about it. Guacamole - Again, fresh, fresh. I thought it was pretty tasty and one of my dining pals thought it was salty. Pico De Gallo - I am CONVINCED they put watermelon in this or the veggies were so fresh it must have jaded or something my taste buds. I could just eat a plate of this! Langoustines- quite tasty! It kind of compared to eating a lobster. Veryyyyyy good! Red snapper - This was the whole filet (bone-in) and it was less than exciting. Maybe we'll try it Nayarit style next time. The rice was quite tasty though! Chapuzon Del Mar (octopus, oyster, shrimp) - Just what it says. Not my favorite after trying the crab, but it didn't disappoint. Nothing was overcooked which is always appreciated. Total bill for 8 FULL adults with tip $213. We ate like rockstars, were served like kings, ate crabs and mariscos with our hands, and enjoyed our BYOB that chilled in a HUGE bucket. What better experience can one ask for? We are already planning our trip back for crabs, rice, guacamole.. and we'll bring mimosas and have us a classy brunch!  This restaurant is not for the dainty or faint of heart.

The first two were accomplished immediately because my friends are amazing and this place is BYOB so we came prepared! We were a group of 8 and the spot is teeny tiny (less than 50 seats), so despite calling ahead we waited just under an hour to get seated. Some of my party got anxious because it was super hot inside and the wait was long, so they wanted to jump ship to Barco Mariscos across the street (which I also heard was fab). However, being the birthday girl... I held firm to waiting it out and enjoyed a couple of glasses of our choice while we waited. That's the beauty of a low key, BYOB location!! Over the course of our hour wait we realized that EVERYTHING looked and smelled AMAZING! When we did get seated, Susana was our waitress. Despite the menu being in Spanish and English (both languages I can read), I opted to ask Susana for suggestions for the table. Like I said, everything looked awesome and everybody eating before us basically told us we couldn't go wrong, but asking Susana, the pro, was the way to go. 1. Crab Legs - So here's the thing... I'm from the DMV area (DC-MD-VA if you didn't know!!) and Maryland crab is the real deal. However, up until last night, my all time favorite crab was from a place called ""No Signboard Seafood"" in Singapore. Yup, Singapore. Here's the distinction I've decided to make... NSS has the best crab in Asia... hands down. Mariscos el Veneno has the best crab legs IN NORTH AMERICA... HANDS DOWN. Yeah I said it! They were that good. 2. Prawns - I'm a shrimp lover but I thought they were just ok... likely because i wanted to devour all of the crab legs so I kept losing focus! The rest of the table were believers though! (Update: These were delicious as day two leftovers!!!) 3. Red snapper - Ok, but not a fave. 4. Chapuzon Del Mar - I enjoyed it for leftovers again this afternoon!! It was a mix of shrimp, octopus and clams. 5. Guacamole - OMG... I almost missed out on this because I just wanted my seafood. It was sooooooo delicious. Like for real. Try some. 6. Pico De Gallo - I unfortunately DID miss out on this for the same Guacamole reason but according to my friends that was a bad move. i heard it was delicious. So my third criteria for my birthday evening was good food and Mariscos el Veneno definitely made that happen for me. I will definitely be back. On my order will be Crab Legs (of course), Guac, Pico, and a different dish that Susana recommends! Things to know for YOUR visit... (1) look for the painted blue store front and address not the name, (2) there will probably be a wait, but it's worth it, (3) try the crab legs and (4) the salsa they give you when you get seated is FIRE... and this is coming from an African who only eats spicy food!

2012-04-03,1.0,"I really cannot recommend this place at all. I went here with my girlfriend because I had a craving for ceviche. It's small with tacky decor, but I don't necessarily view this as a bad thing.  After looking over the menu we decided to order a dozen oysters on the halfshell and a mixed seafood ceviche. As we were ordering, the waitress encouraged us not to order a dozen - that a half-dozen would be enough. Her english was broken, but we were able to decipher that they did not have the oysters on the menu, but had ""California"" oysters instead, which were larger and more expensive. We agreed to a half dozen. When our order came out, we got a dozen oysters after all, and they were absurdly large. They were the size of buttermilk biscuits which, needless to say, is a lot of oyster to try to fit in your mouth at once. They didn't taste particularly good or bad, but the size made them terribly unappealing.  The ceviche was no better. It came in a large goblet and was easily enough to feed a family of four. It contained a variety of seafood, but the quality was disappointing - particularly the imitation crab meat. Because we were presented with far more food than we anticipated we decided to suppress our gag reflexes and choke down the oysters, saving the ceviche for later.  It ended up being thrown out after not even the cats would touch it. To sum up:  If large portions of sub-standard seafood is what you're into, then this is your joint.  Otherwise, steer clear.",-0.9671,0.801,0.068,0.131,0.46987967229902716

2012-03-10,4.0,"I found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. There were a few things you should note: 1) The name of the place has changed. While the menus still say Mariscos El Veneno, the awning outside has a new name. Same restaurant however. 2) I went on a Friday night with 5 people. We expected a decent wait. The wait actually turned out to be 1.5 hours, which we were okay with. Having said that, the place is SMALL. They have an upstairs for 3 tables but you cannot really stand anywhere comfortably to wait. People were in the stairwell drinking beers (it's BYOB) and the other people were standing crowding the diners. We left and came back as did other people. The hostess had limited English proficiency and we saw she misinterpreted people leaving after putting their names down as signs they were going elsewhere. We spoke to her in Spanish and fortunately were reserved a spot in the queue. Even when we were done dinning at 11pm, there were people waiting for tables. The people who dine here are very eclectic. Lots of locals and the infamous foodies. We ordered a number of dishes and they were all delicious. The sauces were spicy and unique. For seafood, they were bold flavors but no so overwhelming you could not taste the subtle flavors of the seafood. One of my friends does not like seafood. They do not have any non-seafood options FYI. I won't lie, I eat really really really (can I add in another ""really"") spicy food. I ignored the warnings of the habanero salsa and loaded up my tostada with it so it was near soupy. I paid the price...that and the next day. It was good but insanely HOT. It is to be enjoyed in moderation. Overall, our bill was about $30 a person and we went all out trying different things and eating till we were bursting. That does not include drinks as this place is BYOB.  In summary, this is a place you go to for the food. The ambiance, wait, and service definitely have room for improvement but that is also what gives this place it's hole in the wall feel.

2012-02-04,4.0,"I could easily see myself becoming a regular at Mariscos El Veneno. I suppose El Barco is ""nicer"" looking, but this restaurant is a lot more fun and the food is definitely superior. Plus, it's just a fun place to go. Loud music, big groups of friends or entire families sharing huge communal meals, and friendly service make this a wonderful experience. And of course, there's the food. Everyone's meal starts with a basket of tostadas and crackers, a plate of lime wedges, a decent tostada with ceviche, and, of course, their infamous salsa. I thought the salsa was incredible. While the habanero certainly burns, the salsa also has a nice citrus flavor with a bit of sweet red onion in the mix; there are subtleties here that deserve your attention. It's certainly the kind of condiment I could easily imagine being served on a beach in Mexico and is a compulsory experience for anyone who appreciates spicy food.  I decided to order the mojarra frita, Nayarit style. It's less expensive than the huachinango (red snapper) and is served with rice, salad, and reasonably good fries. The fish was tender, perfectly cooked, and really more than enough for one person. The final bill was $12, not including tip (BYOB certainly helps in that regard). This was a ridiculous bargain. Now I just have to go back and try the shrimp, langoustines, octopus, and everything else.  I can't even imagine how busy Mariscos El Veneno gets later in the evening. I was here at about 5:45 on a Friday night and it was already packed. By the time I left, there was a solid crowd of people waiting for a table. Even so, the staff made sure to provide anyone bringing in beer or wine with buckets of ice and, in the case of those who chose to mix their own margaritas, whatever else they needed for the process.  This is a great neighborhood restaurant. I can't really think of any reason to go back to El Barco in the future when I can head here instead.",0.9982,0.757,0.235,0.008,0.5427294927294928

I ordered the breaded shrimp with rice and fries.  The shrimps were more like rocks, probably leftovers from the night before. Rice extremely undercooked with a sticky consistency. Even the fries were disgusting! How can an establishment mess up an order of fries!??! We also ordered a tasteless shrimp cocktail, no flavor at all. We used up all the ketchup to bring flavor to it. Unsuccessful! Basically we ordered octopus and shrimp swimming in plain water! I did not eat the plate, I just took it in a doggie bag to throw away, because that food was just plain disgusting!

2011-09-28,1.0,"I was not a fan. However, my boyfriend was. I'll give you both of our sides, but since this is my yelp account, I can't give it more than one star.  They place on your table some unappealing looking contraption of a whitefish(? - I really have no idea, purely a guess since the waiters hardly speak to you) tostada that lacks any flavor at all. With it comes a red salsa that looks incredibly innocuous, but was by far the most offensively spicy salsa that I have ever had in my life. I have a high tolerance for spice, but my head and throat were on fire for about 15 minutes after one single bite. Strike 2. I remained open minded and ordered the shrimp taco, one of my favorite Mexican dishes. I'll grant them this one as a win - the tortilla was warm, flavorful, and the shrimp was well seasoned. Although, I would have appreciated some sort of warning of a mysterious sour cream-like topping on it, but that's neither here nor there. I also ordered the guacamole.  Unless you love onions, I wouldn't recommend it.  It lacked any flavor other than the 60% composition of red onion.  I was severely disappointed.  Even $3 for this is an outrage - I'd say it had less than half of an avocado in it, so being generous, this probably generates a 200% profit ratio for them. My boyfriend's meal could not have had more polarized opinions between the two of us - he ordered the shrimp and crab mixture with noodles in a red sauce.  I think it was the Huicholes Shrimp.  I thought it was terrible.  It was lackluster in flavor, runny, and had little to no seasoning other than the sauce.  He, on the other hand, thought that the sauce was one of the ""top 3"" marinades he's ever had.  I don't know.  I'm just the messenger. Overall, I really wouldn't suggest this place.  The service is shotty, the ambiance (if you can even call it that) gives me the shivers, and I am positive that you can pay the same amount, if not less, for a meal that is 235023 times better.",0.9383,0.761,0.134,0.105,0.4100360750360749

Crispy fried skin with firm fresh meat.  Pretty much free of bones and beautiful.  I dipped the fish in the sauce with squeezes of lime juice and this kept the grin going.  The place is busy, loud, festive.  Mixture of dates and groups, so everyone should feel comfortable.  Someone had a birthday and it added to the festive atmosphere.  This is a place every Chicagoan owes to themselves to go to at least once.  Oh, and all of that food was around $40.  Nuts!",0.9968,0.749,0.216,0.035,0.6042606516290727

2011-07-22,4.0,"Most of the salient points in each review on here are quite accurate - the room is small, the staff is friendly but frustratingly inattentive at times, and the food is glorious.  My wife and I dined at Mariscos yesterday evening. As we entered we noticed that every single one of the tables was occupied. Fortunately for us, we were the first people in line to be seated. With the temperature over 100 degrees outside, I was a bit disappointed that the air was not turned on, but didn't think much of it because it added to the feeling that I was dining in Mexico. After a couple of minutes we were seated and then greeted with the world's largest menus. Because of their size they were pretty awkward, and the vague descriptions therein leave something to be desired. I know what crab means and I can figure out that fillet of fish means I get a piece of something that swims in water, but I had no idea what the different flavor/sauce options were and did not know I could actually choose what kind of fish to have. They should definitely look into more detail for the food options instead of using tons of space on pictures and large font.   We started with the Marlin Ceviche, which was super tasty. On a hot day it hit the spot - it was cool and not overly fishy, and came accompanied with fresh vegetables. I splashed it with some lime and enjoyed it immensely. My wife ordered the garlic shrimp (after being told that they ran out of prawns). She raved about it and wished she could air mail it to her mother. The smell of garlic on her breath hours after we ate and even in the morning only confirmed how flavorful they must have been. I had no idea what to order and the waitress recommended the fried fish because it had a little bit of everything. I still have no idea what kind of fish it was, but it was magnificent. It was surrounded by a barrel full of octopus and shrimp and covered in melted cheese. I ate until I felt like I had to burst and in between each bite sighed in amazement at how good it was. Both entrees came with salad, rice, toast and french fries. Super big portions.  So, as pointed out, the fact that the food here is out of this world more than made up for the size of the room and the somewhat unmindful service. Don't expect glitz and glamour or pristine service, but definitely be prepared for an awesome seafood experience.

The menu is physically large (especially for your limited body space) and somewhat confusing.  I had heard the langostinos, shrimp and crab legs were all awesome.  Unfortunately for our friend has an allergy to shellfish, he wans't able to partake in the shrimp and crab feast.  He did get the fillet of tilapia ajillo style with a garlic sauce and it looked amazing. Hubby and I decided to split the crab legs after our server recommended them.  I was going to get them regardless but I heard the plate was large and we had no idea how much they were.  On the menu it said $29.99 but mine had a sticker over that saying $19.99 and Bryan's said $39.99.  I love this style of doing business.  (It ended up being $39.99 so good thing we split it.  Yes, I'm cheap!) They were delicious.  Swimming in a spicy Nayarit sauce (assuming that's where the second name comes from) which I would have sopped up with the side of bread I ordered which never came.  So I stared at it longingly.  Wondering if it would look odd if I tried to slurp it up with my straw.  Or ask if I could take it home and dip my own damn bread in it. It's a messy meal.  From the sauce running down your arms and the immense sweating and swamp ass going on from the humidity in the place, you better be friendly with your dinner mates and as our friend pointed out, not have any body odor issues.  Also, be prepared for questionable service.  Our gal was great at the beginning, she brought over some complimentary marlin ceviche tostadas (seriously one big one for each of us).  I warned everyone the habanero salsa was alarmingly spicy but no one seemed to heed my warning which made the sweating issues even more intense.  Hubby ordered a fish taco on the side of the crab legs which never came.  He ordered again when I ordered my side of bread and finally got the taco but no bread for me.  Sad. It took a good 20 minutes of us sitting with gigantic plates in front of us before anyone came by to offer the check.  If it wasn't so goddamn hot in there and there wasn't a schoolbus that dropped off a full load of hungry looking children who were pressed up against our window, I wouldn't have minded so much.

Amazing flavor and the sauce (i have no idea what was in it) was spicy and a party in the mouth! Also loved the red snapper - entirely fried. Delicious!  The service was meh, but it's a crowded hole in the wall, so don't expect much on that end.

I tend not to eat at restaurants where there are pictures of my food on the menu, but for El Veneno I will make an exception.  El Veneno has fresh, flavorful, reasonably priced seafood served up in a relaxed atmosphere, with friendly service.  It is BYOB which proves that the food stands on its own and also allows you to keep the tab reasonable.  Anything you order that is stuffed is stuffed and overflowing with seafood and if you order spicy, be prepared for spicy.  The entrees are large and can be shared and while the seafood is the main attraction, the bread is heavenly.  The chef once created a great baked pear dessert for my birthday which wasn't on the menu.  I would have a hard time picking just one favorite, but if forced I think it would be La Copa Veneno & Patas de Cangerjo Estilio Nayarit, Camarones a la Diabla......I could go on forever and eventually list the entire menu.  The stuffed pineapple & stuffed lobster are fabulous and will serve two.  If you go with a group you can order the seafood special for six people at a great price that will provide enough food for more than six.

I'm not even sure what we had.  One person ordered for the table and things started arriving.  I believe we had crab legs nayarit style and a heaping plate of shrimp.  That was enough for four.  Portions are prodigious.  And the flavors are unlike anything I would have expected from Mexican seafood.  Get a couple of orders of fries, because you WILL want to sop up all the marvelous sauces.  I probably looked like a lunatic at the bar several hours later, as I kept smelling my fingers and smiling.

2011-04-10,5.0,"Mariscos El Veneno was hyped up on Yelp and for good reason. We stopped in on a Saturday night around 9 PM with beers in hand (BYOB YES please) and expected a long wait for those deliciously reviewed langostines I had been seeking out. While waiting and periodically cleaning up the saliva dripping from my mouth, it became crystal clear that I would have to try the fried whole red snapper (and obviously get a comparison from my friend as to how it fared with El Barco, the rival across the street). We were quite happy to be called to our table after waiting a mere 20 minutes (roughly 2 beers). As promised, immediate delivery of the eagerly awaited FREE ceviche tostada, which definitely hit the spot after waiting in the warm ""crowded"" waiting space [what would you expect from a little, really tasty hot spot]. I read Bob D.'s review (at least the portion that showed up without being maximized on the screen of my phone). What I negated to do was read on, The following line is as accurate as can be so ill just quote Bob D. ""Served with a tongue biting habernero salsa that was a perfect accompaniment."" Quickly i realize that this sacrelicious orange salsa is habenero (DUH) and I break into a pretty meaty sweat. Considering the relatively tight quarters, i felt kinda bad for the other diners, but no one else seemed to care, notice, or break away from their otherwise raucous entertaining evenings too mind, so BONUS! We all agreed that the ceviche was an excellent way to thank us for patiently waiting and certainly increased the alcohol consumption, which everyone else in the room seemed to also have decided was the most appropriate way to accompany their evenings. In the room on this particular evening, I noticed magnum bottles of high grade vodka, top-shelf small batch Tequillas, and beers/wines or a variety of flavors and countries of origin. Needless to say, the atmosphere is lively and full of energy. The staff really seems to enjoy themselves and are quick to offer help with the all Spanish menu. Tip: I saw what appeared to be regulars sending shots of tequilla back to the chefs, and it appeared to be well rewarded from a gustatory standpoint. To start, of course, we ordered the langostines nayarit. In minutes we were delivered a beautifully spiced, semi-oily garlic-chilli concoction of pure clean crustacean flavors. These things really hit and of course we ate the middles, inners, outters, and heads of these bad boys. This also gave the large pile of napkins on our table a great workout (not for the tidy eaters out there, but definitely a benefit to the seafood enthusiasts).   So far, so good, and I am getting more and more excited for the snapper. I did not have to wait long (roughly half beer, or 5-7 minutes in lay terms). And their she was, in all of her glory, with the classy fried red dress on. My snapper had arrived, piping hot, perfectly fried, and I couldnt wait to dig in. But where to start, hmmm, yes of course, go for the gold, the eyeball, served by me to me on a bed of thin crispy fried tailfin. Immediately obvious was that this fish was cooked perfectly, not to well done, not to soft and mushy. A nice firm fluffy, lightly oily piece of delicious clean snapper. Served with rice and  sauteed onions, it all seemed to work just perfectly,  So how was it compared to Barco? Well my buddy said that the fish at Barco was larger and therefore meatier, but the flavor profile was clearly different and the sides were different, so he couldnt say which was better. This whole review and Im telling you I dont know which is better, kinda  LAMe-O. Just try them both, but Im not sure i can go across the street knowing that Mariscos El Veneno is smiling from across the way.",0.9994,0.755,0.224,0.021,0.5793928093325684

The best way I can equate this restaurant to something people might understand would be to compare it to LONG JOHN SILVER and I find that sad! Keep in mind everything is fried and everything is seafood, without any substitutions or eliminations. I won't gripe on that too much since I understand the trouble that it causes the cooks just wish they had a little something more to choose from flavor-wise. Keep in mind this is NOT a place for vegetarians. Got the stuffed fillet that was just ok and nothing I would attempt again because the fish it was stuffed with was super chewy and overcooked. My friend had the garlic shrimp and really liked it but it was a very basic dish at heart. It was TONS of chopped garlic poured on to small (previously frozen) shrimp with butter. I could make it at home if I wanted to keep vampires away. The gross-ness came when she was able to make a stacked pile of garlic by the time she got to the end of the dish. Atmosphere is terrible  and service was blah. Fine, I expect that with how the place looked but I guess I had just hoped for more. The good aspects were the decent (only decent) ceviche served when you arrived and the no corkage fee.   As it might be evident through my yelp reviews, I love a good byob restaurant, but sadly this won't be on my revisit list.

The Chef came out and said hi to me,  he introduced himself to the family,  he was under the impression I was a regular,  I did nothing to deny it.  I guess if you have a beer and a twelve pack you look like most people on Ashland. The langostines were amazing,  if you are a fan of sucking the juice out of crustaceans heads these will put you over the edge.  They are just like a shrimp with bigger heads and smaller tails,  cooked in an absurd amount of toasted garlic and chilies and finished with lime juice these little mud bugs were inspirational,  the fight was on!  My daughter had red juice up her cheek,  my sons hands looked like he just performed a liver transplant and my beer was covered in shrimp whiskers!

Very affordable and tasy food.  Awesome! My friends and I walked to Mariscos El Veneno on a Friday night surrounded by blizzard aftermath, we had a bottle of wine and a bag of beers.  We were ready for the 45 minute wait but we were extra polite and super lucky and only had to wait ten minutes. Ricky, the busboy who is more like the maitre'd was amazing, chatting us up and getting us a corkscrew and glasses for our wine.  He was really personable and a true asset to the restaurant.  It's rare to receive service with a smile that seems sincere and caring anymore.  Ricky's service was amazing and really made the experience special. We received our delicious ceviche amuse` and cracked some beers.  We learned that the salsa they serve is just unbelievably hot and spent some time seeing how much we could take.  I am a person whom loves hot food and this was just way too hot for me. Reading the reviews before visiting let me know that we should try the shrimp empanadas.  We did, they were delicious.  Right as we finished our empanadas Ricky came out with the Crab Legs we ordered to share between the three of us.  Yelpers... you were soooooo right to recommend them. Huge stack of Crab Legs perfectly cooked and bathed in a pleasantly spicy sauce.  We all learned very quickly to soak our crab meat in plenty of the sauce to really get the full experience.  We had a fun time chatting and cracking and shoving crab meat into our mouths as fast as we could.  We all joked about how we all felt a little self conscious about how we were cracking and tearing and making a huge mess sucking our fingers off before using napkins and noted that it didn't matter because we didn't look up from our plates to see each-other the whole time. $40 to feed three people delicious sea food.  Yeah the music was weird and the room was small but it all kind of worked together to make a memorable night out.  It was like dining in someones home, it felt pleasant.

While the service and ambiance are great, its the food was what prompted me to review - it was amazing!  My boyfriend and I shared the shrimp empanadas as an appetizer ($5) and the crab leg entree ($30) as a main.  Thank goodness we had the foresight to share because there were at least 3 full crabs on the plate.  We both have large appetites and didn't finish it all.  The sauce on the crab was delicious - a little spicy and very flavorful.  I would happily pay twice what we did for a meal of that quality - less than $40 for dinner for two (pre-tax/tip, including my horchata :) is a killer deal. Everyone we were with enjoyed their meals also, and appeared to be very generous portions.  One note of warning - the salsa served with the ceviche tostada to start is incredibly spicy.",0.9977,0.678,0.287,0.035,0.6733597883597884

I certainly can't prove that I got food poisoning from here, but I'm 99% certain that the shrimp entrée I ate here did a number on my GI tract. In fact, I'm so certain that I'd wager a testicle (the right one; I'm partial to my left). Not only did my ""faucet"" begin to mysteriously leak for an entire week straight--starting approximately 24 hours after I ate here--but so did that of the lovely lady who dined with me. Coincidence? Not likely. Now I know that I'm hip to the point of everybody (including small fuzzy animals) wanting to emulate me as much as possible and all that, but usually not to the point of blasting a dookie once an hour. So the next logical conclusion is that the shrimps are what gave me and my date the runs. If the food was stellar, I feel certain that my anus could forgive this affair, but frankly, my dinner was bland. So bland that I'm shocked by the positive reviews of this place. I mostly find myself wondering if it's due to a case of misguided white people thinking they've found an authentic gem of Mexican seafood, so therefore, the food must be great. Or maybe the side of fries that comes with every entrée has fooled everyone into thinking this food is somehow tasty because, as we all know, a heaping pile of fries can turn most anybody into a believer.

My sister loves food too and we decided to have a lunch just the two of us.   We batted ideas back and forth but ultimately decided on Mariscos El Veneno since it was a new place to us, we love seafood, and I religiously scoured the reviews on Yelp. Parking was easy, we were seated immediately, and received ceviche on a tostada all in about 5 minutes.  I was not exactly sure how to eat it but karate-chopped it in pieces with my fork and picked them up with my hand.  Pretty yummy especially with a bit of that extremely hot salsa/pico de gallo stuff.  We ordered the langostinos and the crabs Nayarit style. The langostinos came out first with rice, salad, and fries.  I picked one up that had been nicely halved and thrust it in my mouth.  WTF.  I was so shocked at the buttery sauce, the lovely heat, the sweetness of the flesh, the graininess of the head...perfection.  I pretty much stopped talking to my sister (who did the same) and could not eat these things quickly enough.  Also worthy of noting are the fries - I wish we had a plate of just these.   Then, this huge platter of crabs arrives and I'm thinking everyone in the restaurant is seriously doubting that we can put even a small dent in the massive amount of food we acquired.  Little do they know that these two Asians can EAT. My sister is way daintier about cracking the crabs.  I picked them up, ripped legs off, broke shells in half with my bare hands, fished out pieces of that succulent sweet meat, and dipped it in the sauce.  I went through many napkins but those dead trees sure had it good.  We tore through all the langostinos and one half of a crab was left.

Instead of the usual chips to accompany some pre-dinner salsa, the server brought us each a tuna tostada and one of the more fiery salsas I've tasted.  We ordered the shrimp empanadas, fish and shrimp tacos (which I didn't try, but they were apparently tasty), and the shrimp fajitas.  The latter were served on an enormous platter that had an almost confusing array of sides - undressed salad greens, delicious savory rice, french fries, and cheesy garlic toast. Perhaps I don't know enough about fajitas, but I was expecting some soft tortillas with the dish.  I made do with the basket of tostadas instead, and the savory, saucy shrimp and rice more than made up for the difficulty of eating them off a crispy, flat surface.  The inevitable leftovers from such a huge platter were almost as tasty the next day. The empanadas were also delicious, each topped with a slice of avocado.

2010-03-29,1.0,"After looking for a casual seafood restaurant I was excited to find Mariscos on Yelp. The reviews are great and it looked like it would be a fun time. My GF & I arrived at 7pm on a Friday and took the last open table in the restaurant. We had brought wine and a minute after sitting down a wine opener and glasses were brought out along with the menus. The tuna tostadas with a very hot salsa a few minutes later. The service was off to a great start. I ordered the fish special and my GF marinated shrimp. The waiter brought out my fish and a few minutes later a breaded shrimp for my GF. When we said that was not what she ordered he said that he knew, they were out of marinated shrimp and this was the closest thing. It took a minute or two arguing with him before he ""got"" that if they are out of something he should let the customer pick the substitution. In the end my GF ordered garlic shrimp as a replacement, when it came out it look like the shrimp were 50ct (tiny). Nothing like the size of the shrimp on anyone else's plate around us. I assume they didn't want to use anything but the cheapest option after having something returned. My fish was good and the shrimp was fine other than the size. The whole experience killed the mood though. We didn't see the waiter for the rest of the meal. We had to ask the hostess for our check which took 20 minutes to get. Between the check and second meal we were running very late so I paid cash which rounded to a large tip and ran out. I understand that a restaurant runs out of some foods and don't mind making a substitution. Not having a say in that process and getting something that was not at all wanted is crazy. Had the waiter just asked, my review would be very different and I'm sure I'd be a repeat customer.",0.8397,0.887,0.077,0.036,0.4652350427350427

We came here on an early Saturday night, about 6:30pm. It was probably one of the best things we did. One of.  The place was packed by 6:47pm and a crowd hovering over all the tables. Mouths watering. Lips smacking. Hungry for what we were about to order. What would that be? Seafood. Not your sushi grade tuna, but what I think of as Mexican seafood. We're talking shrimp, prawns, octopus, lobster, marlin. Nothing fancy, but just done straight up good. Our order? A plate of shrimp civeche, shrimp empanadas, a half an order of plantains and guacamole. Oh and to drink? Cava. Not theirs, ours. It's BYOB here. Music to our ears.  What else is a symphonic harmonious blend to sooth our senses? Men singing Mexican music with accompanying guitars being strummed. Friendly, energetic and cheerful servers. Ricardo was ours and he made sure we had a blast.  But the food? What about the food? Was it good? Was it tasty? Did it make stomachs smile? Yes! Yes it did. The food was darn tasty and a lot of it. But what wasn't a lot was the bill. $32 for all that we had, well that and it left us picking up our jaws off the floor.  The decor is simple. The food is fairly straight forward. But that is something you put off to the side, because it is good. Real good. I will say watch out for the fire educing ""sauce"" they bring you. The simple combination of habanero, vinegar and a little onion will make you break out in a sweat and cry for mercy. Unless you kinda like that stuff.  Oh. I do.

When it came time to order, we were baffled by the huge amount of choices, and decided on the langostinos, which had been recommended to me, and the lobster nayarit.  Both were huge servings, tons of seafood - but in my opinion, they were both way overdone and too greasy.  The langostinos were tough and overcooked and swimming in butter; we did not finish them.  And the lobster platter was good, but again, very greasy and overdone.   I've had cheap seafood before at dives in San Diego, and they were prepared fresh and succulently.  I think if this place would cut the cooking time in half, they'd be better off. The service was fine and amiable; and the decor was casual and appropriate for the kind of place it is. If I was in the neighborhood, I'd probably order from them more.  But I don't imagine that I will go out of my way to eat here again.",0.9841,0.815,0.159,0.027,0.5804444444444444

Mariscos el Veneno was my choice.  I wanted BYO, I wanted someplace a little bit different, and this seemed to fit all my requirements. Almost entirely seafood, this menu was daunting at first.  I really wanted the langostinos (prawns), because I love that sweet meat, but the whole legs still on it made me shy away.  Not to worry, this birthday girl was lucky enough to get someone else to order them and pick out the meat for me.  Delicious.  And perfectly spicy.  I think I would just suck it up and figure out how to deal with the little eyes staring at me for my next trip. Let me take a brief diversion to the whole spicy issue.  The sauce on the table bruised my mouth.  Never in my entire life have I experience a searing pain from a salsa until that fateful night.  But the best part, now that it's over, is that we ALL experience it, and we all were laughing and crying our spicy tears together.  And the ceviche brought for the entire table at the beginning of the meal contained the perfect neutralizing tomatoes and refreshing seafood flavor that calmed our sore mouths.   I went with the crabs, Nayarit style (Pacific coast of Mexico).  It was a massive plate of crabs, drenched in sweet butter sauce.  (See here:  static4.px.yelp.com/phot… )  No bibs or crab-crackers here, so my crab companion and I created our own bibs and basically immersed ourselves in the buttery goodness in front of us.  I eventually gave up, my arms immersed in butter to my elbows, I was full of delightful crabby goodness. Also enjoyed at the table was the stuffed pineapple.  A half pineapple, stuffed with shrimp, octopus, and other seafood delights, it was enormous (and looked yummy to boot).  Another specialty was the huge platter with shrimp and octopus.  Spicy and delicious, this was yet another thumbs up dish from the table. Guacamole is a fabulous deal, $3 for a MASSIVE plate, perfectly chunky and perfectly spiced.  It's the perfect accompaniment to the spiciness of some of the dishes. No corkage fee here, which is a nice touch. The service was outstanding.  They stored my lovely cake in the back while we ate dinner and brought it out to a birthday song with candles, which was a lovely treat.  Plenty of water was provided, especially after the incident with the ""veneno sauce,"" and we never felt like we were rushed to leave. Loved it, even though my mouth hasn't fully recovered.   Hasta luego, Mariscos El Veneno.",0.9988,0.701,0.237,0.062,0.6646226415094338
2009-09-28,5.0,"I'm a San Francisco girl. Born in SF, raised in Northern California. Needless to say as a California girl, I've always lived where there is never a shortage of quality seafood and exceptional culinary talents.  So when heading to Chicago this past weekend and asked if there was a place I had to go back to (I lived there for about 2 years in college), I said no. So a friend took us to Mariscos and said, ""Just sit back, I'll order."" And order he did. Platters of heaven just kept coming and coming. (Thank you Sakid! I owe you one for this.)  The langoustines have been on my mind ever since. They are drenched in a delicious buttery sauce and served butterflied, making them messy and delicious. I have found that messy foods always seem to taste better and the langoustines were no exception. (Exhibit A - Ribs)  Mariscos is BYOB, a great and missing feature to SF restaurants. Your dinner comes with complimentary ceviche served on a tostada shell and plenty of limes (so bring Coronas!).  We also ordered the red snapper (comes with head and all, meaning that you get to eat the best part, the cheek. yum!), rice (full of flavor), and the octopus. The octopus was breaded and fried and served in a slightly spicy sauce. Everything we had was incredible but the langoustines were by far the biggest hit.  Rumor has it they have some incredibly large lobster here as well. And next time I'm here, I'm ordering the crab too. It looked and smelled great. The service was excellent even though it was crowded. There's also a cute little patio area that is covered and has romantic lights and greenery everywhere. If you want to add to the romance, a mariachi band did come around. :-)  Mariscos is by far the best place I've been in Chicago to date. I will definitely be back. And I'm now officially on the hunt for some delicious langoustines in San Francisco.  ps- If you do not know what langoustines are they are like very small lobsters, or very large shrimp. They are also called ""Norway Lobsters"". And being Norwegian, I think we have a connection. A really deep one that I should explore daily.  pps- did I ever tell you that sometimes I become obsessed with certain foods? It used to be dim sum, sushi, ice cream, etc. Right now, it's langoustines. Thx Mariscos, you may have created a monster. Oh! One more quick thing, they have lots of hairspray in the girls bathroom if you need it. Random but interesting.

So the cokes came out after 40 MINUTES. We asked about our guacamole--that came out 15 minutes later. The waiter said the service was always this bad. He blamed the kitchen, but the last I checked the kitchen doesn't make the coke there. Our empanadas finally came out and they were super nasty. Not to mention, that the dough wasn't fully cooked. The couple sitting next to us actually got their entrees before we got our appetizers and they were seated 15 minutes after us. They actually felt so bad they offered us some of their food.

I'd say great considering it's complementary. They also gave us a bucket of ice to hold our wine and beer in. I took the advice on yelp and went easy on the salsa which is, as everyone else has said, pretty hot. They give you a bunch of tostadas to break up and use for the salsa which is a nice touch. Honestly, since the salsa's so hot, don't bother going nuts on the tostada/salsa combo. Because they give you a lot of food... We had a half dozen oysters, guacamole, the prawns, and two shrimp dinners.  Oysters: Solid; nothing too special. Guacamole: Really good and they give you a heaping plate of it. No joke, for $3, it has to be the best guacamole deal I've ever seen. Prawns: They split these big suckers in half and loaded them with a brown sauce that was unbelievable. Everyone at the table agreed that it was one of the best-tasting sauces we've ever had. The two shrimp plate people kept on dunking their shrimp into it and we couldn't get enough. Shrimp dinners: Huge plate of food and the shrimp were pretty good, but not unbelievable. It was my birthday and the chef brought out this mango ice cream cheesecake type-deal with, I think,  a raspberry sauce over it. It was a little different at first but then the flavors and coldness went really well together.  At the end of it all, everyone had a great experience.

While I was in the bathroom (which was reasonably clean) I was unable to warn my friend about the hot sauce that is innocently presented as salsa. I came back to the table to find her eyes watering and her quickly consuming more tostadas and fanning her mouth. She loves hot sauce, but this stuff truly is INTENSE. You literally only need a few drops to feel the burn. Since I wasn't feeling super hungry, we decided to split a dish. We also ordered Pico de Gallo, since it is a favorite of hers. We were quite surprised when we were presented with a HUGE amount of food! We had the garlic shrimp, which came with rice and a small salad. The shrimp was cooked perfectly with an amazing garlic sauce. The rice was also very good, and the dish was just overall well-done. It was the perfect amount for two people.

Overall, the food here is amazing. For all the food we got, the total was only $13 - great for feeding two people with leftovers. The only downfalls are: 1. Brush up on your spanish, because the menu is a little confusing and is heavy on the Spanglish and 2. The service is kind of slow. First they tried to give our food to someone else.

There was a veritable flavor explosion in my mouth. I have just gotten home and had to unbutton my pants.  My (now ex) boyfriend and I went there for our ""break up dinner"". Don't ask. We're weird. Anyhow, when you sit down they give you tostadas with ceviche and a plate of limes. That alone was impressive and delicious. We split the fried whole snapper with a garlic pepper sauce and it was amazing. Simply amazing. It came with a really flavorful rice, cajun fries (think 'rallys') and salad. We also ordered two fish tacos. They were also the best I've had in Chicago and the sauce they put on them is perfect. The shrimp empanadas were a little to deep fried for my taste, which I never thought I would say since I'll eat anything deep fried. They were just a little too oily. That still doesn't take away from the 5 stars.  The place isn't fancy. It's a nice, noisy, fun, vibrant atmosphere. More a dinner for fun, laughs and good food. Not so romantic but definitely great if you want to impress a future love/fellow foodie.  Now that I'm single....who's gonna go with me next?",0.99,0.749,0.213,0.038,0.5518162393162394

And whoever doesn't appreciate the mariachi band that comes by is definitely someone I would never want to party with.  As soon as we sat down they brought us a delicious, large tostada covered with a seafood ceviche and a side of limes. (and yes, the house hot sauce is def liquid fire, I won't mess with that again no matter how tough I feel). My friend and I decided to split two dishes, the crab and a shrimp recommendation from the waitress. She brought out the shrimp diablo which was cooked in a spicy red sauce and served with cajun fries and rice. The crab was next and was so fresh that my friend and I joked that it looked like it was going to walk off our plate! We also had a fun time getting messy and cracking them open to pick out the meat. Portions here are huge (the people next to us ordered a seafood gazpacho that was served in punch-bowl sized goblets!) so I'm proud of the fact that we ate everything except for two of the crab legs.

2009-03-05,1.0,"ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK! I live near by and thought I would try the place out.  I went there with my girlfriend on a Wednesday night.  First I will say I will never go there again.  The place is dirty and cramped.  They try and shove a 5 person Mariachi band in a restaurant they might only seat 20 people.  When I left the restaurant, I felt I lost my hearing.  The service is extremely slow!  I waited 15 minutes before they even took my order.  Considering it was completely dead in there, that is unacceptable.  We started off with the homemade guacamole which was good.  Just as we finished up that and were waiting on the entree's, low and behold a cockroach comes crawling across my foot.  After that I got up and told my waiter that we were leaving and never coming back.  He said he would comp our meal, but I said no and I paid and left.   I have heard rumors that if you go around back you will see tons of trash that is left out for days.  They do not have access to an alleyway so they pile the trash up on the back porch.  I can only imagine the disease infested rodents and cockroaches that are having a field day back there.  I would suggest to everyone that they stay away from this place at all costs.  I just called the city food inspector on them and I can't wait for the article in the paper that they were closed down.",-0.8833,0.93,0.008,0.062,0.3561111111111111
2009-02-17,4.0,"Ended up here on a monday evening with a friend in search of seafood and i wasnt dissapointed.  Walking in was a little awkward because we had to walk through like a 6 piece mariachi band that was blocking the door. Once we got in we used hand signals to communicate with the hostess and grab a table. As interesting as it was, the mariachi band was a little annoying because i just wanted to catch up with my friend on a chill monday night.  But, the food and value def made up for it. We ordered way too much food and still only managed to spend $40 plus tip. We got the shrimp ceviche, half order of oysters, langostines and garlic shrimp. The only thing i wouldnt order again is the oysters.  This is a real basic, almost kitschy place with blowfish and nets hung from the ceiling, and the people that work there are nice enough, but this is by no means a fancy date place. Go for good food with an adventurous friend. oh, and its BYOB.",0.9459,0.826,0.134,0.04,0.6395833333333334
2009-01-16,5.0,"If you are a seafood lover you will definatly love the food and the value you receive at this joint, My first visit was at the Pulaski location. It is quite larger than the space on Ashland and they even had a three piece band. On our first visit we had the langostinos and champueza del mar. The flavors were amazing. The champuza is a blend of shrimp, octopus, and scallops in a rich butter type salsa. The second time we went with intentions of having the ceviche. When we walked in we noticed a table with a stuffed lobster tail and decided to order the same. It was amazing the lobster was fresh, sweet, and perfectly prepared. My only gripe about this visit was the server.  He was drunk as a skunk.  He was behind the makeshift bar taking shots of peach shnapps or mad dog not sure but he should have not been on the floor. It was entertaining yes, but I felt bad for the women working with him that evening. he was not doing anything but dancing and drinking. Third visit we had the coctel and seven seas soup. On a cold day this soup is perfect. It had oysters, shrimp, crab legs, scallops, marlin, and other various shellfish. It was so hearty and delicious and served with a side of soft buttery garlic bread. Amazing. After the soup we went back three days later and had the pina relleno. So so good. It is a hollowed out pineapple filled with a blend of shrimp, scallops, crab, pineapple, and papaya. The salsa is a mushroom cream salsa which seems strange for a mexican restaurant, but it is so yummy. The food here is amazing and the value is the best thing about it.

2008-12-13,4.0,"This place was great. We went on a Thursday night and it was packed. The free ceviche tostada appetizer was delicious, but not particularly mind-blowing or anything (it was reminiscent of a citrusy tuna salad). We also got guacamole and scrimp & octopus cocktail.

It was wonderful! The sauce was great. It came with fries and rice and veggies, and they were all good too. Surprisingly good seasoned fries. The rice looked like it wouldn't be that good, but it was. We were also visited by the chef--twice!-- asking how our dinner was, and thanking us for coming. It was a very festive, fun atmosphere.

So the food, oyster aside, was palatable - like I could choke it down, but simple favorites like fries and guacamole were flavorless and flat.  However, their langastinos are quite tasty.

But the red snapper here is as good as if not better than any I've ever had from El Barco.

I didn't know if I felt helped after or not, but we both ordered the fried red snapper.  and we were very happy.

2008-08-05,4.0,"The decor is not going to wow you but the food blows the ""boat"" across the street out of the water. (Sorry, couldn't resist). The food is based on recipes from the Mexican state of Nayarit, which is known for its seafood. Bring some beer and ask the waiter if they can make some cerveza preparadas (something like a bloody mary made with beer) which is great after a long night of overindulging.  My favorite dish is the Nayarit-style langostinos (prawns) which has the most delicious seasoning. They do require some work and using your hands so you might want to skip them if you're a ""dainty"" eater. I also recommend the shrimp aguachiles verdes: butterflied raw shrimp covered with a lime and jalapeno sauce with cucumbers and tomatoes. Very very spicy!  The huachinango (red snapper) al ajillo is another great dish - its absolutely massive and really delicious!  I wasn't a fan of the seafood cocktails here since they're a little bland but everything else I've had was delicious.  The chef/owner is really sweet and often comes out to greet the tables.
