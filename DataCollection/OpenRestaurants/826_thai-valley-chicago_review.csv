2017-06-25,2.0,Food was ok.  Service was poor.  We have to look for the server if we needed something.  I ordered a pad Thai and asked for it to be made spicy.  When we got the pad Thai it was too spicy to the point that it's inedible.  I told the waiter and he gave an attitude saying that if I order spicy you would get it spicy.  But it was so unbearable.  They did replace it though but the whole incident just made our dining experience bad.  I would not go back to this restaurant.,-0.7351,0.911,0.017,0.072,0.4333333333333333

I was attracted by the reasonable lunch price, only to find that it was not for carry out. I dined in, with the service of a nice, though inattentive waiter who kindly removed my largely inedible food and discounted my bill by half. I ordered chicken wings, which were too  huge, had a nice crispy crust, yet a dangerous red bleeding flesh. I was shocked! The most oily  crab rangoon ever cooked, soaking up old grease in a super large wonton wrapper drowning bland, stingy filling, I picked at them trying to find a happy moment. The soup was spicy and interesting, though NOT Tom Yum-my. The rice was undercooked leaving me with a scoop of crunchy grains surrounded by a ""special sauce"" of ketchup. No imagination, creativity, or even proper execution of the basics. It's in my hood...though I will likely not return.

Their fried rice is hands down the best friend rice I have eaten anywhere in the US. I've lived in LA, in New Orleans, and a few other smaller cities, and Thai Valley's fried rice is the one I compare all fried rice to. And, none ever come close. It could be a combination of my taste buds and their unique recipe, but whatever it is, it works. If you try this place out, start with the fried rice and then work your way out. The fried rice with the wonton soup: my family's classic combo. I guarantee that you will be satisfied with this combo.

Some weeks the food comes out fresh and fast, other weeks, we have to wait 25 minutes just to get our orders in.

Other times, we're the only ones there and end up having stomach growling contests before we even get to speak to the waiter. When I say 'the waiter' I really mean, the one and only waiter. Again, regardless of how busy the place is, it's always just this one guy! I don't get it! The food itself is also hit or miss, but for $6, the lunch special (soup, appetizer and entre) never fails to satisfy.

I have been to a lot of Thai restaurants.  Lots.  It's a favorite ethnic go-to... Chicago has made me sad in this regard.  Most places just don't cut it and all of these 'fusion' asian restaurants just spread the mediocrity around the various style so that they all just suck.  But I digress: I have been to a lof of Thai restaurants and have never heard of this FRIED Pad See Ew.  I mean, the dish is actually named ""Fried with Soy Sauce"", so FRIED Pad See Ew sounds redundant, but there it was next to regular Pad see Ew for a dollar up charge. Oh my, what a novelty.  I could see myself buying this from a stand at some local festival while I watch toddlers scream for funnel cakes. Yet a novelty does not save a restaurant from its myriad other failures. First order was take-out.  Ready in 30 minutes the fellow on the phone said.  I headed over there and announced myself at about 25 minutes.    It wasn't ready, but no worries, I'm 5 minutes early or so.  Not sure why it takes THIRTY MINUTES to make Coconut Milk Soup and Curry that you already made hours ago and just have simmering on the pot waiting to throw in whatever meat I choose, but whatever. The inside of this place was odd.  In the front near the windows facing the street was the dine in area, which seemed fine.  But in the back sitting area which doubled as the waiting for pick-up area was a large TV.  So if you were in the dine-in area, you got to hear it but not see it.  Cozy. So when I got there, the TV was on number 15 of the countdown of the TOP TWENTY STUPID DAREDEVILS!  Quality television for the discerning intellectual. Before my food was ready, I got to watch the rest of the show in its entirety.  I was even prepared to get mad when I got to see the number 2 STUPIDEST DAREDEVIL but then get my food and leave, never knowing who had the dubious distinction of being number one.  Because that's how it always works. Except this time.  I got to finish the show.  For anyone that's counting, this puts me in the restaurant for FORTY FIVE MINUTES.  So what the guy on the phone really meant when he said 'ready in 30 minutes' was 'ready in an hour and ten minutes'. Anyway, took that home and had some bland Thai food, not at all inspiring.  Sad sad sad.  Except for the Fried Fried with Soy Sauce.  That was fun. So why did I go a second time?  Because the first time may have been a fluke.  Head Chef might have been out sick that night or who knows?!? Yeah, lightning strikes TWICE!  Bland, boring, not properly cooked, poor presentation.  'Fried rice' that was just white rice with sauteed vegetables thrown over it.  The Tom Kha was OK, but how do you mess up Tom Kha? Anyway, sorry for you guys that think its great.  I pray for your palette.",-0.9843,0.769,0.095,0.136,0.49241717150370995

I don't know whether you guys who gave this place better than 2 stars have had Thai food outside of Chicago (because so far Chicago thai restaurants are FAIL) but this half-assed garbage does not even rate. Ordered the tom ka, papaya salad, basil fried rice, and pad see ew. Tom ka we ordered with tofu but got it with chicken. Nothing special about it, tasted like they heated up a can of coconut milk and threw in some chicken. Papaya salad was actually decent, though nothing special. Basil fried rice...well I don't know how they can call this fried rice because there is nothing fried about it. I got some sad wilted basil leaves, mushy steak and a mess of  bell peppers and onions (supposed to be hot peppers) over plain old steamed rice. Absolutely not fried rice by any  stretch of the imagination. Even for what it was it sucked. Pad see ew- Yuck. A meager smattering of overcooked broccoli  and dry chicken accompanied overcooked noodles that were baaaaaarely sauced and certainly not sauteed to a nice caramelized glaze like they're supposed to be. Tasted like they dunked old noodles back into tepid dirty water, chucked in old chicken and broccoli cooked yesterday and called it a day. We ordered take out and I guess if I had ever set foot in the place beforehand I would never have ordered from there in the first place...place smells of stale cigarettes and they have a TV blaring in the back while people in the front get to eat to it as background music.

2012-08-31,1.0,"I hate doing this. It's my first review ever and I wish it was a good one, but after a series of bad experiences with a place that used to be one of the few good places to eat withing walking distance from my place I feel like I have to say something.  We moved to the neighborhood a couple of years ago and had so many bad experiences with the restaurants in the area, but when we found Thai Valley we were very excited. We would go there or order food every other day and although there was no consistency with the food, it was always reasonable. Sometimes it was actually amazing. While the prices are good, the service has always been a problem. I could be wrong, but I think they only have one server working there, because I've never seen anyone else working there. Which is fine, the guy was always very nice and we would just avoid going on busy times. But the last couple of times we've been there we were very disappointed with the wait for a menu, for someone to take our order, for the food, for the check... Finally we had it, when after waiting for like 15 minutes, the waiter came to take our order and I felt like trying something new but wanted to know more about the dishes. The guy got annoyed and said we needed more time and he would come back once we were ready. Fine, whatever, I can decide on my own. But another 15 minutes went by and no sign of the waiter. We got up and left, hungry and very frustrated, and I sworn to never come back.  Anyway, tonight, after a 12-hour shift, I thought I didn't feel like cooking and I thought I would give them another chance, so on my way home I placed an order of panang curry, with chicken and shrimp, and broccoli added. This is my standard order and I've never had problems with it before, no consistency, but it was never bad. So I sit to eat my dinner and as I serve myself I notice that the panang curry didn't look normal. The broth was weird, like that was too much water or something, and all I could taste was the fish sauce, barely no coconut milk. The broccoli was extremely over cooked, like frozen broccoli that you heat up in the microwave, and it tasted like a sponge. Finally, I realized I had paid $2 to add the shrimp, but I could only find 3 units. 3!!!  So, inconsistency, bad service and now bad food. Good-bye Thai Valley.

The pad Thai is up to par, a bit wet though.    When you get the panang it will take some time to prepare, but it's done correctly. Simmer using low heat. If you eat enough Thai curry you will know what I mean when the curry is prepared correctly.

2012-07-11,1.0,"Ok, ...a lot of people seem to like this place, but we weren't so excited by it, so I'll share our experience. I tried the ""crispy"" Pad See-Ew based on some yelper's opinions of it.  Not knocking their love of it.  But I personally found it horrible.  So bad I didn't eat it. Let me preface this with the fact that I love deep fried things.  I don't dab the grease of my pizza with a napkin, I'll eat an entire funnel cake by myself, I think deep fried twinkies are amazing. But this crispy Pad See-Ew was yucky.  Each of the noodles are deep fried, in theory this sounds wonderful.  In practice, I think their oil was about 100 degrees too cold.  Those noodles soaked up so much oil.... when you bit into the noodle you got a mouth full of oil.  Also, the ""rest"" of the dish tasted like it had no sauce.  So it was deep fried noodles with tofu and egg...and it tasted like deep fried noodles, with plain tofu and plain egg. My husband got the pepper and garlic tofu.  He also was unimpressed, he added a bunch of crap from around the house and made it tolerable for himself, but we both looked at each other and decided we never needed to try this place again. We tried to get the pot stickers, but they either don't make or were out of veggie ones.  So we got the spring rolls.  I didn't have any major complaints about them but my husband thought they weren't good, so I guess it worked out well.  I ate the spring rolls for dinner because mine was awful, and he ate his doctored pepper and garlic tofu. If you're thinking about trying this place for the first time, maybe don't try these items... I bet the WHOLE menu isn't awful, but our opinion of these were so poor, we don't feel the need to (potentially) waste more money trying.",-0.9248,0.767,0.102,0.132,0.5649769585253458

It was a different type of noodle from what I've ever experienced and there was no taste at all. I thought maybe they forgot to add seasonings to it and just gave us the cooked noodles. There is no way that was pad thai. It was so bad we didn't even eat it. The bass was pretty gross. They serve it whole, which doesn't scare me. My family eats whole fish all the time, with head, tail and all. The problem here is that they did not scale it well. All the scales were left on the tail, head and sides of the fish. I know it's deep fried, so maybe that doesn't matter, but who wants to eat fish with scales on it? The taste was ok, I've had much better. It did come with a nice garlic sauce.

This is a little different from most lunch specials which include those. We settled on Basil Leaves over rice with chicken, and Noodle kee Mow with Beef. And at the last minute, we threw in some Crab Cream Cheese appetizers. Those were a little cold upon arrival and just OK. The entrees were excellent ,and the layers of flavors done very well, with the heat at medium, as requested. The beef dish had the perfect mix of sweet and hot. Portions were moderate.  The thing which impressed me most was our server's hair. He was a latino chap with the smoothest hair I'd ever seen.

I usually get the pad thai lunch special, which also comes with a bowl of tom yum soup and vegetable tempura. I am always so full when I leave, and I always have money left over. The lunch specials are under $7!  I love their pad thai; noodles are always cooked nicely. Their portions are large too. I also recommend getting the crab rangoons. They're always so crispy and with the right amount of filling. No frills here. Don't expect top-notch customer service, but know they try their best. You walk in, choose your place to sit, and if the waiter is a bit busy, you can always grab a couple menus at the front desk yourself. Everyone is really friendly!  If I'm starving and craving great food for reasonable prices, I never go wrong by going here.",0.9742,0.804,0.159,0.037,0.5138655462184873

Of all of the Thai restaurants that I've been too, Thai Valley's papaya salad is my favorite. Most places you get a mix of carrots and papaya, but their salad definitely doesn't fall short of the amount of papaya you get. (That's how a papaya salad should be!) I love the dressing.. it's not too sour, not too sweet. They give you big chunks of tomatoes and half to whole roasted peanuts. I always ask for spicy!  I also like their basil beef because of the flavor of the gravy. Some other thai restaurants barely have any sauce to go with their beef. Thai Valley gives you a good amount and I like the way that they slice the beef. It's just the right thickness.

We were frustrated because we were hungry, tired, and cold, but mistakes happen - we weren't upset with them - until they tried to charge us the difference between the pad thai and the pad si eiw!   We're talking about $3 here.  They f****d up our orders, we had to go back out into the freezing cold, and they want to charge us more?!!  I politely disagreed with them at first, but then when the owner started yelling at us, that was the last straw.  I told him I'd be sure to write a scathing review (too bad I'm a few months late), and he threw our food at us.  Thank goodness that the food was already out of the kitchen, at least.   Never again.  I don't care if it's a mom and pop joint.  If you feel like you can't afford to comp someone a measly $3.00 after you screwed up their order and inconvenienced them, you don't deserve to have good customers.",-0.5983,0.825,0.08,0.095,0.5608888888888889

Fyi: 1 order of Crab Rangoon 8 pcs.  Cream cheese is plain, not sweet.  Good with the provided S&S sauce or hot sauce. Dine-In: Dining room is adorned with a visual smorgasbord of Thai dcor.
