2017-08-18,5.0,"This is a lovely Mexican Cafe on Bryn Mawr which is their second location. My girlfriend and I always sit at the bar and are frequently served by Jose, who is delightful. The food is fresh, superb and authentic Mexican. Their tortillas are great, warm and tasty. I especially like the shrimp dishes, but no one complains about the quality or the portion sizes. Visit here when you are hungry. I prefer lunch time because they have excellent, value priced specials and $3 margaritas. The decor is attractive with an appropriate south-of-the-border feel. Parking can be a challenge, but we live close by so we ride our bikes there. I frequent the restaurant at least twice per month and have never been disappointed with the food quality or the service.

It would have been cheaper for me to order 3 tacos a la carte so I thought at least the special would come with rice and beans like the other dinner specials. When I asked the waitress about it, she barked at me that it was 3 tacos and then stormed off. Service was terrible and I had to ask multiple times to get some water.

2017-06-27,1.0,"What a poor excuse for Mexican food!!! The décor was cheesy, and the food lacked anything that could be considered good. The chips that were brought to the table were extremely stale, and the salsa was chunky, but it was pretty much a cold tomato soup. It lacked anything that could be considered spicy. Everything that was served at my table had the consistency of wet cardboard, and had around the same flavor. If you want better Mexican food, there are other places in the area that will serve better food, at half the cost. If you are allergic to flavor and spice, and feel like paying too much money for that poor excuse for food, then this is the place for you. Also, there was a group of people that had two kids, that kept running around the restaurant, and at one point, were punching each other.

The margaritas were good, and the guac tasted good, but it was really, really small. My fiancee ordered the pork tacos, which were very over cooked, very bland, and not even served on corn tortillas. She describes the pork as being like cat food. I had a steak taco and a chorizo gordita. These were both way oversized, and also not very good. The taco had a good grilled flavor, but no other flavor in the meat, and could have been much better served with just onions and cilantro. The chorizo on the gordita had no flavor whatsoever, and was extremely greasy. If I am going to pay over $50 for tacos, they had better be the best tacos that I have ever had in my life, and not these bland things I had tonight.",0.9741,0.787,0.172,0.041,0.5846581196581195

I ordered the shirmp and peppers - cardone (or something like that). Omgahhh it was so basic. I mean, the shrimp were definitely of the frozen variety. The rice at the bottom was mad overcooked. The shrimp were overdone. And the sauce it all sat stewing in had a cheap taste to it, as well as a stank after-taste.  Then, to add insult to injury, there were random pieces of corn and peas mixed in here and there. The tortillas were warm, but chewy. How sway? How are tortillas chewy?

It was simple - I was craving Mexican but didn't want to sit at a divey taqueria, or pay $20 for enchiladas somewhere fancy. The Cafe hit that middle ground in almost every respect.  Large seating area, bar, decor... They threw a few bucks at this place, giving it a warm festive atmosphere. The service was on point from start to finish, and very friendly. Great margaritas, and though there are no micheladas listed on the menu, they were happy to make me one. Ordered the steak and chicken fajita combo, also not listed, but again the Cafe was more than accommodating. Nothing stood out about the food, but didn't disappoint either. There's something a little strange about being neither impressed nor dissatisfied, but the reasonable pricing certainly played a part in me not getting overly critical.  Will I be back? Yes, but only because it's right by my place. In order for this establishment to hit 4 or 5 stars it'll need to up it's fajita game. To be honest, the chicken and steak tasted pre made.

Our drink orders came pretty quickly, as did some chips and salsa which was a nice touch. One thing about the menu that stood out were the prices; they were quite high. I ordered two chicken tacos, and a side of rice. My boyfriend ordered the chicken burrito. Once we ordered, service became a little slow. We waited about fifteen minutes for our food, and it came out warm, not hot. My boyfriend requested no lettuce and sour cream in his burrito, but he cut into it and it was bleeding sour cream. It took another few moments to flag down our server -- he was at the front conversing with the host -- and swap out the dish.  The service got a little better after this. Our server brought our first drink refills, and the second burrito came out quickly and hot. The chicken in both dishes were phenomenal. Marinated with what tasted like lime and just the right amount of spices. I would have liked some hot sauces on the table, but didn't feel like flagging the server down again to get some. My only quibble with the food would be the side of rice. The portion was minuscule, and it didn't taste authentic at all. It kind of tasted like an Uncle Ben's Ready Rice version of Mexican.

I stopped in at about 3:30for lunch today seeing as though they promote a 2-6pm special at the bar on appetizers & margaritas. The bartender greets & offers a drink list & menu with no mention of the feature in the window (which is ONLY served at his bar). I get a server from the floor who kind of hybrids as server/bartender at this odd hour. I like to try these happy hour menus out first with these happy hour places to see what kind of food & service is offered. When you're practically giving something away & you still hold the hospitality standard it shows me I should frequent you on more of a regular dining level. Not to mention I live down the street & could potentially be a regular stream of income for such a place. I ordered everything off the bar menu because I saw it in the window, still no mention. At this point, I'm just doing it to see what will happen. The food was decent. Safe in flavor aspects to appease the spineless spice less crowd (why they even eat Mexican is beyond me). The margarita was flat & lifeless. I expected the bill to reflect normal pricing as it did. When I mentioned the bar menu pricing, after pretending like I they didn't know what I was talking about I was told ""because I didn't ask about the special, it wasn't the special"". I don't know another place on earth that boasts a special & expects you to play detective without mention that you're in a game with them.

While it's not the cheapest Mexican food you'll find in the area, it's tasty and it's a very comfortable environment to have a sit down meal. Also, their guacamole is top notch and made tableside. I think $8 is expensive for guacamole but this guac is so good it's worth it!  The one dish I had that I was a bit disappointed in were the duck flautas made of sweet potato tortilla. The ""tortilla"" was super thick and didn't really have much flavor. I wish it was thinner and they had more duck inside. It came with a side of rice (which I love here) and papaya salad which I was really excited to try but ended up not being much more than some papaya and mango sprinkled with queso fresco on top. I expected there to be at least some dressing or have the fruit tossed with something but really it was just a side of fruit :( They have a pretty decent Mexican buffet brunch on Sunday mornings for $11 and it includes guacamole and a whole variety of your typical mexican dishes.

There was no cheese or sour cream, but now there were no potatoes. This sorry excuse for a black bean burrito consisted of watery tasteless black beans and onions. They beans weren't even flavored with anything. They want $13 bucks for this?!? I didn't want to send it back again, fearing that someone would spit in my food. I tried to eat this over priced garbage. So, when I told the waitress about why I was still upset she was ready to tell me again how terrible the kitchen staff is.

I went with my family on a Sunday looking for a breakfast spot, and when we saw they were all ridiculously packed, we opted for this great little Mexican restaurant. But luck hit us well finding this spot. They had a buffet going that was out of this world. Everything I loved was offered, from Chorizo and potatoes, to guacamole, to skit steak and chicken, even fresh orange juice and cranberry juice. All of the ingredients were FRESH! I absolutely loved the quality and great taste everything had. I also really liked the fact the entire staff was Mexican and that there was a very real authenticity to this little mexican cafe. The atmosphere reeked of authenticity, from true to life Mexican decor adorning the walls and ceilings, to the classic Mexican music being played. -1 STAR My mom was the only one out of the whole family who ordered anything off the menu, which was a burrito. It was one of the worst burritos I have ever tasted.

2013-01-20,4.0,"I've been to That Little Mexican Cafe II twice for dinner. At my most recent visit, we were greeted very enthusiastically by the hostess with a ""buenas noches"" and seated immediately (only a party of two). As a person who deals with customer service issues on a daily basis, I was a bit taken aback by how authentic and happy the hostess seemed to be. My partner and I were then greeted by our server, who was very kind to make a few recommendations for us. She was a bit playful/touchy with my partner, but I figured she just wanted to be friendly and help him trust her recommendations. We ordered the freshly-made guacamole, which is a must. They  bring over a cart with fresh ingredients and prepares the dish in front of you, asking whether or not you would like a few key ingredients (e.g., garlic, chili, etc.). Staff were consistent in making sure we had enough chips available to enjoy our guac, and refilling our waters on a regular (but not *too* regular) basis. My partner ordered the duck taco dinner - for which he was very happy. I ordered the Azteca salad, which was very tasty, but I was disappointed to find that the extra fixings seemed to be lacking - such as corn. To give my salad a little more body, I ended up stealing some rice and beans from my partner's dinner. Overall, the service at TLM Cafe II is very good. Our food came in a timely manner, and it always boosts my confidence in an establishment when they have an open kitchen, like TLM, for all to see what's going on behind the scenes. In other words, they don't have anything to hide when it comes to cleanliness and food prep practices. We didn't have to wait forever for our check, and they also didn't plop it in front of us prematurely, which I find tends to happen in a lot of restaurants in the States. Many of the staff made it a point to wish us a good evening as we left the cafe, which gives an added feeling that they truly care for our business, and make it a point to make us feel welcome so we return. The biggest downside of TLM Cafe II is that if you're driving, street parking is either LAZ metered or you end up spending a lot of your time driving up and down Winthrop and Kenmore to find free parking. The best way to get there and home would be to take the Red Line, especially if you plan on enjoying a margarita or two.",0.997,0.781,0.18,0.039,0.48151418026418025

Well, with El Norte gone, Taquiera Uptown being just ""meh"", I decided to give this place a try - also because I felt like a drink.  Inside the place is spacious and well- decorated. The food ( I had the chile rellenos) was good and a HUGE portion, even the salsa was spicy to my standards - salsa is made with habaneros, though likely de-seeded so its not too spicy. The drink I had (The Enchanted - agave nectar, lime juice, mezcal - I LOVE MEZCAL!) was pretty good, although it was a bit too sweet (chill out with the agave nectar please) and was also served in a martini glass -didn't see that coming.  So what's wrong with this place? THE SERVICE! Describing the service as slow would be a compliment. It was awful. Ordered the drinks. 10 minutes later they decided to show up - after we finally ordered, the food came out quickly, but not by our waitress, so that's probably why. Our waitress was friendly, but attentiveness was not here thing.

Weird, and inappropriate. Portobello fajitas were good, but not for the money. Not even close. One order was wrong; it was easy to fix. It wasn't fixed. Sure, maybe--as our server said--the kitchen screwed up. Perfectly understandable. But no one from the kitchen carried it all the way across the restaurant and outside, and never checked it against the order, dude.

Our waitress brought our drink in a metal shaker, from which she pored both of our drinks. I asked her, ""Is this the mini?""

The list of negatives continued on from there. * Chip refills did not happen at the same time as salsa refills leaving us with dry chips. * We didn't get napkins or utensils until after our 3rd chip refill. * The nachos took about 20 minutes to show up. When they finally did, the three of us took 1 bite each of the chewy soggy mess that showed up and gave each other that OH HELL NO look. $9 for 8 chewy stale chips with a dollop of cheese sour cream and guac. Really? We had the server take them back immediately. (Bonus point for having them removed from the bill without us asking. I would have gone ape shit otherwise.) * The margaritas were fine but she never asked us if we wanted more. She should be pushing those $35 pitchers like no tomorrow. * We got maybe one water refill the entire time after we had to ask for it. * The entrees were good as usual.

I live a block away from the place, so my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try yesterday night since we didn't want to go far. At first, a male bartender greeted us at the bar; he was very nice, but unfortunately another bartender (female)took over. Surprisingly they have a very extensive tequila and wine menu. Aside from that their margaritas and other cocktails are very mediocre. I had the Acai mojito, which didn't taste like acai at all. Trust me I know what acai tastes like. The bar management  should be aware of this fact to avoid misleading customers into thinking it is an acai mojito. The mojito had a very low level of alcohol. It tasted more like a well done lemonade with a pinch of mint, it was pretty much a non-alcoholic mojito. I asked the bartender about it, and she started talking about antioxidants and nonsense talk that didn't answer my question about why my mojito tasted awful. I noticed she kept on talking and never understood my concern. Nice thing she gave me a free shot of rum saying it was because I didn't know what I had ordered!  On the other hand, my boyfriend ordered the Porfirio's margarita, which had a high content of alcohol-the only good thing about it. Aside from that it was not too cold, and the bartender left the cocktail shaker standing there, which at the end was only water. You never leave the shaker there! By the time my boyfriend wanted to pour more margarita into his glass, it was only water. Fortunately, the first bartender came back and my boyfriend ordered a second Porfirio's margarita to see how his compared to the previous bartender. It was much better, well done and this bartender did know how to pour all the content of the margarita into the glass and didn't leave the shaker standing there.

Food was pretty good - guacamole lives up to its reviews - very flavorful! Good size portions - brought food home with us! I wasn't a fan of the salsa - but that doesn't mean it was bad.  Just a little more oniony than I prefer.

You get the picture. It didn't happen. Then I saw there was a Groupon Now, and available on one of my rare days off from work. Perfect! I made the trek to the Bryn Mawr historic district after skipping lunch so I could really fill up with yummy Mexican food. The place is really cute, well-decorated, dimly-lit so that it seems intimate and not dark. Service was quick and friendly. But the meal?? . . .  I ordered vegetarian enchiladas in verde sauce. Presentation was decent. The enchiladas were accompanied by about a half cup of rice (looked exactly like a half cup measuring cup was used to serve the rice) and black beans. The enchiladas were not hot, merely warm. Enchildas were filled with carrot and potato. I like that they use veggies other than the ubiquitous cheese, but boy, that made them heavy. Well, I was pretty hungry, and it was what I had chosen to order, so I ate. The verde sauce had almost no flavor. I can equate it to the Target brand green sauce I bought a couple months back. I ended up throwing that away.  The beans were almost lukewarm. That's not good. Now, I was there early, before 6pm. There were only a few tables occupied. There is no excuse for serving food at an improper temperature. I can't imagine the waiter left it sitting in the window for long, as he seemed to be prompt, efficient, and certainly not busy. I think it wasn't prepared properly in the kitchen. I dislike writing reviews that aren't favorable, but part of Yelping - at least, I think so - is helping other people spend their hard-earned money in places where they get value. It's like friend to friend. So, My Friends, if restaurant decor and service are very important to you, you may like That Little Mexican Cafe. HOWever, if you also think your hot food should be served hot, and there should be good flavor, you should go elsewhere. Would I go here again? Yeah, I'd probably give it another try, if someone else was paying. On my own, though? I work too hard for too little money, even using a groupon. There are many, many other Mexican restaurants that have better food. That's where you'll find me. P.S. I tipped 20% on the original cost of the meal, NOT on the price after the groupon was applied.

Service was incredibly slow and I had to ask twice for napkins.  The food was mediocre at best which is weird to us because we usually enjoy the food at the Evanston location much more!  We opted for their steak enchiladas and my son had their taco plate with a plate of the nachos.  The nachos were sparse and the guacamole didn't taste as fresh as it should. Even though we had a Groupon, I tipped 20% for lunch just because I typically feel bad for businesses that don't get much business unless it's for a coupon.  Not sure if we'll be back at this location again - I'd rather stick to the Evanston one.",0.9068,0.852,0.1,0.048,0.546783625730994

Not to mention their own website doesn't have a menu, which is unhelpful. Meanwhile, what my partner in crime ordered, was not what she got, which kinda sucks. Not a big deal but when you ask for mole and get verde isn't the best of outcomes. For appetizer, the empanadas with goat cheese were awesome, straight up. If you haven't had an empanada before in the style of that little mexican cafe think a deep fried pierogi. Given the seasonings, it was awesome.  As a main course, I had the chile relleno con chorizo, which seemed like a very unique combination. I don't think I've seen many places that do that combo. Plate came steaming hot and excellent.  So overall, food was good, but absolutely not worth paying what is probably a 50% premium over other decent mexican restaurants. (15-20 a person on dinner alone).

2011-07-02,3.0,"Seems there's a lot of hate on this place, so maybe the management has some work to do. Yes, it's way more expensive than El Famous Burrito and the like, without actually rising to the culinary excellence or even ambition of a top-line place.  And yes, TLMC does have its origins in Evanston, not generally considered a hotbed of fine Mexican cuisine. But the food seems to be mostly attentively prepared, and there are some nice fresh touches. And the margarita doesn't taste like it was sloshed out of some big chemical tank. Is it my first choice for Mexican? Well, no. But I'd be very willing to stop for a drink or have one of their lunch specials, or brunch,  if I was right there at the right time.  So lunch. The Groupon unfortunately wasn't good for the $8 lunch/$4 margarita specials, so we ended up ordering off of the regular lunch menu. We were pretty underwhelmed by the stuffed jalapenos  appetizer. While it was nice in theory that they weren't deep-fried like the poppers we get other places, all the dish was was about 6 lightly broiled jalapeno halves with a blob of melted cheese on top, circling some ick ranch dressing. And since it seems like they've all but bred the heat out of jalapenos these days, it was six bucks worth of bland--at the very least, they need to serve it with a more creative dipping sauce.  Fortunately the entrees were better. I had the fish tacos. For the $10, there were only two of them, but each was crammed full and served on a double tortilla. The thick tortillas appear to be hand-pressed, which is a very nice thing.  The grilled fish had good flavor, with a bright hit of lime. The accompanying beans weren't really worth eating, so I didn't, and the rice was nothing special. Still, even after mostly disdaining the sides, I left full. I'm told the chicken fajitas were good.  Again, served with super-fresh tortillas. I tasted the (shaken, not stirred) margarita, and I thought it was pretty good. The salsa was ok, though very mild.  The restaurant itself is large, spacious and slickly attractive, and the outside seating area looked pleasant except for the 40 mph wind gusts blowing that day.  We had good service, even if the final encounter was with someone who whisked away our remaining chips and salsa about a nanosecond after asking if we wanted to be brought more. Update: I had bought a second Groupon based on my reading that they were going to have weekday breakfasts with a menu that included huevos motelenos (a fave of mine), which they discontinued almost immediately after the Groupons were sold. So we went for Sunday brunch buffet. Buffet the day we went included steak fajitas,  tamales, tilapia, chicken enchiladas, huevos revueltos,  cheese quesadillas,  guacamole, OJ, cranberry juice (I was hoping for jamaica, but CJ is OK), green salad, jicama salad, a few salad toppings, fruit, really tasty flan and a bit of cake.  Probably a couple of things I'm forgetting, too, in addition to beans and rice. With the exception of the eggs and the juices (pretty much the only concession to the ""b"" part of ""brunch""), the selection reads more lunch than breakfast. It would have been nice to see some chilaquiles or something, as the revueltos were one of the less strong offerings.  I thought the buffet overall was a little less good than the Evanston version--I would have really liked for them to have the squid salad I like so much.  But it was okay.

2011-05-10,4.0,"This is the upscale Mexican restaurant for the Edgewater neighborhood and a local Chicago chain with 2 or 3 locations. As such, it is a little more pricey but offers a wide range of drinks, great shelf selection of tequila, good selection of wine, and a greater variety of dishes. They take a liberal approach to many dishes, like chile rellenos stuffed with chorizo, much of the standard fare is adapted. They also have a variety of sauces for different dishes, like green sauce for the scallops paired with papaya salsa, which always impresses me when many Mexican restaurants stick to the basics. I've been a big fan of their tamales, which are always perfectly cooked when available and come with both a mole and green sauce.  Overall, I may be a bigger fan of their atmosphere and service than anything else, and will be the first to admit it. I know some friends who have been unhappy for a lack of authenticity. It comes off more as Cali-Mex or even New Mexican, like a fusion between San Francisco and Santa Fe. The ingredients are fresher; meals are a bit less greasy and there is more openness to experimentation. Those are the reasons I would honestly say it is NOT Tex-Mex or traditional Mexican, both of which I am highly fond of but tend to be heavier and more predictable.  I have to say, the fresh-made guacamole is awesome. It's not the stuff that comes with meals, it is made at the table. I loved their carne asada burrito the last time I was there. I had been craving it for weeks. It was served with rice and refried pinto beans. One note, blended margarita fans will sure to be a bit let down and the severs will advise you to steer away from them. I have followed that advice and never failed to leave the place without a warm feeling! A pitcher is about 8 drinks normally served with low-balls.

The guacamole is not spectacular, and the house-made chips and salsa were underwhelming.   Each of the four of us ordered a different meal: Mahi Mahi tacos, burrito, flautas, carne asada.  Each cost $13 or more.  The fish was not seasoned, the mango salsa was flavorless, the burrito hardly merited the price paid, the carne asada was served with neither rice, beans, or tortillas.  The flautas seemed just fine. Dessert failed to rescue the meal.  The pastel tres leches was quite dry and not as spongy as it should.  Our friends tried the sopapillas, and they were ok, but also quite unimpressive.

2011-03-19,2.0,"As a resident of Edgewater I want to see local businesses succeed. So it is with trepidation that I write a negative review about a local place. I am saying what I need to here in the vain hope that someone from the restaurant will read my words and make changes accordingly. Let me start with the good aspects. Margaritas: clearly the strong point of this place. They have a variety of styles, and a large list of tequila to choose from. The result is a solid, if not fantastic margarita. The menu indicated that the margarita that I wanted (the one without sugar added) was served in a Martini glass. I dislike martini glasses for anything not containing a true Vodka or Gin Martini (sorry, its the purist in me) and so I asked the waitress to please serve it in a Rocks glass. Apparently this was a problem for her, as she balked at the request, and said that the amount would not fill their rocks glasses. So I asked her to please do what she can to make that happen. So she said she would give me a ""double"". Fine, I say. Whatever...the drink was good and I was planning on having more than one so the fact that she made me buy a double to fill a single old fashioned glass didnt completely bother me. The fact that she balked at a customer request however was my first clue that something was not right here. Im not one of those sticklers for service in a restaurant. If the food makes it to my table, still hot, and intact from the kitchen, and has been unmolested (no spit, no hair,etc), in a timely manner, then Im happy. The service at ""Little Mexican Cafe"" is, in a word, overkill. My friend and I were involved in a conversation throughout the meal and our waitress, along with at least 2 other people from the wait staff came to our table to make sure things were ""OK', ask if we wanted more of anything, bring more water, offer desert. It was intrusive to say the least. I started to get the impression they were trying to rush us out of the place, but there were plenty of unattended tables around us, so I cant imagine that was the problem. I looked around and seemed to notice that they were doing this to all of the other tables. Very annoying. I was almost ready to tell them to pull up a chair and join us, since they seemed so interested in what was happening with us.  As for the food: I was not that hungry so I ordered some Guacamole and some Nachos, while my friend ordered the Tamales. (Sauce on the side, because she is like that.;) The food was OK. Honestly, I have made better Guac in my life, and Im pretty sure the order of $7 guac consisted of one HALF of an avocado, and the rest was tomato, garlic, onion, cilantro, lime, etc. The nachos consisted of about 15 tortilla chips with a whisper of cheese, a lot of sour cream and pico-de-gallo. My friend liked the Tamales well enough, so no complaints there, but for this repast we paid a whopping $85, including tip. It seems to me that this is exorbitant for a simple ""Mexican"" meal, plus 3 drinks. Not sure why things cost so much here, but its clearly not the ingredients of the food itself. I got the impression that I was a tourist in my own city, being fleeced as such. They must pay high rent? who knows. Bottom line is between the intrusive service, the mediocre food, the tip jar on the guacamole cart...oh and did I mention the place is very loud? And the ceiling has these strange orange tiles that look like they belong on the set of a Star Trek episode.

Strike 1:  The margaritas were BAD.  I could empty a sugar packet and lime juice into a glass of water and make a better, stronger margarita.   Strike 2:  When we mentioned to our server that we'd had the margaritas before and enjoyed them, and what we had in front of us ""tasted off,"" she simply stated, ""No, it is the same...I will ask the bartender.""  *leaves, comes back 10 minutes later*  ""Yes, he says it is the same.""  *walks away* Strike 3:  No apology.  No offer to replace the drinks.  No effort to make the situation better.  Nothing. I didn't expect them to bend over backwards, I just wanted a margarita that tasted like every other margarita I had there before.  Instead, I got terrible customer service accompanied by a glass of iced lime water.

2010-10-30,3.0,"It's everything as advertised by fellow yelpers. Decent food with questionable service an irrational prices. I used a groupon to check this place out.... here's my take. Table side guacamole: good, but a little wet. Made with lemon and lime juice. Pretty yum, but not anything I'd go out of my way for. Did i scarf it down? nope. but still preferable over the tableside salsa (toooo drippy) Pork and pinapple tacos: a hot mess. Proportions are terrible. Way too much of everything. Too much meat. Too much grease. Can't really mess up the pineapple. Again. Tastes okay. But overloaded with cheese and lettuce and extras and grease. Not so pleasant to munch into a taco with everything spilling out everywhere. Tamales with mole and verde sauce. Terrible proportions. You could eat half way through one and never get to the meat until you reach the other side.  Sauces were okay, but they were oddly heavy on the mole sauce. Nonexistent with the verde. So much cornmeal, and not so tasty. Pretty dry. Rice and beans. Nothing special. Prices: $8 for guac without getting extra chips? cuh-razy. $2.50 for a jarritos?? jewel's got them for 70 cents.  Service:   A joke.  I was crossing my fingers. We were seated fine. The host ended up taking our drinks. A minute later our server asked for drinks again. Didn't take long for our food to reach us. Actually right after our guac was served, 30 seconds later our entrees arrived. Not so much of an appetizer, eh? We were never asked how the food was, after the food was set on our table. Isn't this kind of critical? Like a minimum expectation?  As a result, my boyfriend's tea was never refilled. The rest of his dinner was eaten dry, our server MIA. We were never checked on again. Well.  Not until we were sitting for 20 minutes with food completely untouched.  After our food was taken away, another 15 minutes for our check to arrive. After 10 minutes from being given our check, we gave up. We walked up to the host's stand with our check.  The host goes to the back kitchen to find our server, who had been occupied with other workers in the kitchen. Our server comes up to us at the hosts' stand to finish our receipt with us.   Awwwwwkwaaaaarrrdd.......  It's a terrible pet peeve of mine when other diners come in 10 minutes after us and are somehow able to leave 20 minutes before we do. The saving grace is the decent food.

I went here with a couple friends this past Thursday night wanting a bite to eat. At first the service was fine. Prompt and attentive. We ordered the $8 tableside guacamole and when the cart came over, there was actually a tip jar staring us in the face! How tacky can you get? Not to mention $8 for 1 avocado worth of guac. We ordered, the food came relatively quick, we ate and then waited....and waited...waited some more for our server to come by so we could ask for the check. 10 minutes later, after she finished her 5 minute conversation with the table next to us, it appeared we were finally going to get the check...but no. She goes to the kitchen and seems to be starring at tickets on the line. 5 minutes later nothing. Then we catch her again and she says she is going to get our check, Then she goes back to the line and I see her counting her tips....yet another 5 minutes after having a mini melt down in my booth and about ready to just get up and walk out, she finally brings the f;ing check. There is nothing worse than having to wait over 20 minutes to get your check when you are tired and just want to get home and are instead held hostage. It ruins the entire experience.

Both the drink and the food were crisp and fresh, even though they were a little pricey. The service was not great though - we sat around for 15 minutes waiting for someone to take our order, and then no one came around to take our payment for a similar period of time. Despite that, the server could not have been more kind. She apologized for all the delays (blaming the confusion on some mix-ups among the staff), and gave us some free guacamole (yum!) to go with the chips and salsa (which were also delicious). So skip to the second visit. This time, same service problems (and more!), but the server was completely disinterested (or confused). My friend ordered veggie tamales, but when she was cutting into one, a large chunk of something brown was inside. We all tasted and inspected and decided it was maybe pork. Not veggie. The server came over and we pointed it out, asking if he knew what it was. He asked my friend to put the large chunk on a plate. He took it to the kitchen, returned a few minutes later without the plate, and said it was cheese. A large brown block of cheese. Oh well. Either way, we were expecting him to ask if she would like something else, or if he could replace it somehow. Instead he just walked off. Anyways, after several more discussions and more confusion, we got our server to ask the manager to take 50% off the tamales.

I'll start out on a positive note.  The place is really charming and clean and I honestly thought walking in here that we may have found a winner; but of course, for the first time in my life ;) I thought wrong.   The wait staff was nice, but you could tell that the bus-boys and gals didn't speak English except for knowing the word, ""HI,""- which to be honest, was the only authentic aspect of the restaurant.  The food was very plain and ordering the quesadillas, I walked away feeling like I could have bought a bag of tortillas, cut up some leftover steak and melted some cheese over it in my microwave at home instead of paying the $12 price tag on this plat of blah.  Honestly, a quesadilla is not hard to screw-up and charging $12 kind of sets the bar high for taste... The bar had been dropped and buried in this case- sad, but true.  My friend that joined in this boring meal was not impressed by his burrito at all.  He basically said the same thing, very bland and boring.  I trust him when he says this, because he is a Mexican food fanatic and knows what's good and what's not when it comes to this genre of food.   Honestly, it's just not a great place.   The place is cute and catches your eye when walking down Bryn Mawr, but it's just a lady with a lot of caked on make-up that will bore you the second she opens her mouth.  When you see her....

After our food arrived, delivered not by our waiter but instead by one of the busboys, we were ignored for the most part. Our waiter paid little attention to us, never offered to refill our iced-tea and seemed annoyed when we requested salt and pepper shakers (all the tables surrounding us were without). At one point, another waiter or busboy stopped by and asked how our food was and cleared our plates away - probably because he noticed our waiter hadn't come by in about 10 minutes.  When it was time for the bill to come, our waiter finally showed again, but was cold and seemed ready to just get us out (especially after we declined dessert like we did those appetizers).

Jim had the tacos and I got the tamales; tamales were homemade in corn husks and absolutely delicious. The atmosphere was great; good music and a mix of families and couples there.

I hate to admit it, but I almost always order the same thing, unless they have their mahi mahi tacos on special, those are just awesome.  It's always two Porfirio Margaritas, guac, and a tinga burrito.  Sometimes I get it ala carte, which is a great deal or as a meal so that I get the rice and beans, which aren't anything special, I'll admit.  So go ala carte.  The hubby always goes for the modelo which isn't anything different than any other modelo, but he likes it.  He also gets the Enchiladas Mole, one chicken two cheese, which they are always more than happy to do even though he sounds picky.

Cutesy Mexican-themed things hanging from the ceiling: very necessary since without them you'd never know what kind of food this is supposed to be. I know enough about Mexican food (have lived there more than a year) to realize that most of it is not supposed to be really spicy. Mexican restaurants offer all kinds of salsa for people to add to put a little bit of chili heat in their food, if they so choose. The problem here isn't that there's too little chili (although there indeed is too little chili) but that there's too little flavor. Too little salt, too little fat, too little garlic, too little of all the things that make mole great. It's like food made for someone in a hospital. And with restaurants like this, high prices are key. Why? Because too many of the regulars are skittish about eating in a ""Third World"" restaurant and rely on high prices--ridiculously high, given the quality of the food--to reassure them that this is a clean, pleasant place.

We ordered the guacamole to be made at our table and it was standard. Nothing very impressive. I ordered a margarita and he ordered the tequila flight which we both enjoyed quite a bit. However, we had not yet looked at the ridiculous prices on the menu. $14 for a 2 (or 3, I'm not positive) taco dinner does not a little Mexican cafe make. And that was the least expensive thing on the menu. The 3 enchiladas were about $16. It's cheaper to order your tacos a la carte, which is what I ended up doing. My boyfriend went with the enchiladas.  When they came out, not only were the fillings wrong, the tortillas left plenty to be desired.

This place, by comparison, is Cancun: homogenized and safe for the tourists. You'll have a fine time in Cancun, but when you head back Stateside, you can't honestly tell anyone you visited Mexico. Because you didn't. Credit where its due: table side Guacamole preparation (make sure you have a couple bucks to tip this guy, its expected) was excellent, fresh, and allows you to dictate the heat level. Grilled calamari salad was amongst the best I've had, anywhere. Papaya salad was also great, as were all the side sauces. Amazing flan. Friendly service from everyone and bright, airy room with lively decor. Downsides? Margarita mix as opposed to fresh lime, which halves the flavor but doubles the hangover (great tequila selection though). Cochinita Pibil (usually one of my favorite dishes) fell flat. Rice was cooked without chicken stock and the beans without pork- concessions to vegetarians (I love my veg friends and fam but sometimes they make me shake my fists at God) surely... but its why they don't taste authentic, or even that good.",0.9961,0.707,0.261,0.032,0.5555555555555556

From the outside it looked like no one was in there but once we entered there were several tables taken.  Both of us are ""bar"" people and there were empty seats so we plopped down and ordered up some margaritas.

Again, pretty bland, the Masa moreso the pork a little more flavorful. The Masa also didn't seem to be cooked properly and was a little wet, doughy or whatever, the texture just wasn't firmed up all the way through.   The Chicken Quesedillas were pretty good, but the actual temp seemed to be the its drawback...so again, kids, consistency is not always a virtue.  A few positives that bring this to a 3 star as opposed to a 2.  The ingredients were incredibly fresh and the rice and beans were nearly the highlight of the entire meal.  It seems all the ingredients(literally and figuratively) are there to make this place a solid 4 star but the execution was just off imo.  Will be back to see if that was just an off day or if they continue to consistently miss the mark.   A final downside: a bit overpriced.  $12 for two tamales?!  A $10 burrito?

(don't ask) They smothered the poor little bound and gagged chilis in an unidentifiable sauce... so you couldn't see that they left the bondage gear on. I had to pull one or two out of my mouth while eating. I dug through my meal and removed the rest... turning a semi-nice plating into carnage.

I'm just saying.  Our waiter wasn't the most personable person, but he made sure we had our food and that we weren't without drinks.  It seemed like he was taking it personally that we didn't want appetizers or dessert (err, that our dessert was more drinks!).   For my entree, I ordered the enchiladas verdes (cheese) and managed to eat everything on my plate, and I'm usually a doggy-bag kinda girl.  The sauce was delightfully tangy, and I thought their rice hit the spot.  My friend ordered the chicken gorditas.  She seemed satisfied with them, even if they were a challenge to eat without making a mess.   I'd go back here if someone else suggested it.  However, I know that I can easily find Mexican food that is just as tasty for way less money.",0.9854,0.832,0.148,0.02,0.6087777777777778

We did not make a reservation but arrived at the restaurant around 7ish and were seated within 15 minutes. I would recommend calling ahead of you plan to arrive any later because it filled up within the hour and a line had started to form by the time we got our appetizer. The Food Authentic, good (medium-sized) portions for an average price.  We had the chicken taquitos for an appetizer and the Skirt Steak and Mole Enchiladas for entrees. The steak was tender and juicy while the chimichurri sauce accenting the steak was flavorful but not overpowering. If you're looking for a good steak without too much starch on the plate, I highly recommend this entree. My partner had the mole, which was large in portion and he actually didn't finish the whole thing. The mole was adequately spiced but the rice was bland and could have been left off the plate.  All-in-all very authentic and fantastic service. We've found a place to take out of town guests that is sure to please without breaking the bank. Our dinner with non-alcoholic beverage, an app and two entrees was just under $50 and worth every penny.

I did like the overall atmosphere of the place and since I only live about 3 blocks away decided I would give it another shot for dinner. So last night a friend and I went back for dinner and that is where I give TLMC a 4 star rating. Everything from the service to the food was awesome.

We got the guac where a cart is rolled to your table and they make it fresh right in front of you. It was soo good. Chips were good as well. I ordered a margarita on the rocks and it was okay...not the best margarita I have had but it was definitely potent. For my entree I had the Mexican Fire Roasted Salad which consisted of fire roasted carrots, zucchini, polano peppers, red peppers and onions, queso fresco and a vinegarette. There is nothing the smell of fire roasted vegetables put down in front of you and the taste was yummilicious.  My friend and I shared a dessert. We had the Bananas Flamaedo. Oooh it was good. I could have had the whole plate to myself but since I'm trying to controll my portions...grumble, grumble. It was two bananas cut in half, drizzled with this yummy sauce and a scoop of ice cream.
