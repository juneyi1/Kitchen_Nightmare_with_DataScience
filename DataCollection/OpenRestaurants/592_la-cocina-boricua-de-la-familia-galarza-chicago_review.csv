It was a gloomy Wednesday afternoon and the restaurant was almost full house. We were greeted and seated immediately by an energetic waiter who I assume was the owner of the restaurant.  The food - Delicious. I started off with an order of their Canoa which is sweet plantain filled with beef, great starter. My main order consisted of a steak jibarrito and steak cubano. The jibarrito was definitely the highlight of the meal. Plantain was crispy and steak was full of flavor. The cubano on the other hand was just meh, nothing spectacular. All orders come with puerto rican rice and soup.  The price - Very affordable and big portions. An order of appetizer ranges from $3-$6 and entrees range from $8-$12.  The service - Great service, our server was always attentive and checked up on us just enough. She was also very friendly and seemed to know everyone in the restaurant.  Decor & ambiance - Plenty of seating, pictures and decorations everywhere for visual appeal. The atmosphere was very family like, our waiter seemed to know everyone and lots of regulars were dining in the restaurant.  Overall - Great establishment, great service, delicious food.

It was his first time experiencing Puerrto Rican food outside of our home and I was embarrassed when we asked for a pork chop dinner and we were told that they were out of pork chops. We settled for something else on the menu since we had our daughter with us and she was hungry. As dinner went on, I would admit that the food was good, but wouldn't you believe it, we asked about dessert and they were all out. It was only 8 PM. How do you run out at 8 PM on a Saturday? Makes no sense to be honest. We finished up and took off to Margie's Candies.  Cocina Boricua is a nice place, but only good when you show up early enough to get what's on the menu.

2016-05-25,5.0,"Muy Sabroso! La Cocina Boricua de la Familia Galarza is one of the most legit Puerto Rican restaurants around. As many have said, it is family-owned and, as a result, is very homestyle, cozy, and comforting.  Stopped by here the other day with my S.O. As soon as we arrive, there is a full table of 10 unvested, on-duty Chicago PD detectives and police officers. All of them packing heat and staring intensely at us. If that ain't true Chicago-style, I don't know what is. You know the food is good when all the cops roll up to eat at the joint. And NO DUH... The food is good here, dummy. Their jibaritos -- a Puerto Rican x Chicago sandwich made of two pieces of flattened, fried green plaintains as the bread with some type of meat filling, sliced tomatoes, mayonnaise, melted white American cheese, and lettuce -- is seriously so darn juicy and honestly almost flawless. Not too greasy, not too salty, not too anything. The arroz con gandules (aka P.R. Rice), that comes with it, is a perfect blend of rice, sofrito, tomato sauce, Sazon, and pigeon peas. If I can get real for a second, I will say that I like it even better than the one at the original source, Borinquen Restaurant (now El Nuevo Borinquen) on California ave.  We also shared one alcapurria and one pastel as an appetizer. Both of them had a nice, well-seasoned, not-too-dry chicken filling. I've never had an alcapurria before, but theirs was pretty good. It was like a large, green plaintain-based croquetta. And the pastel? Damn... I love me some pasteles. Theirs was flavored with the banana leaves they wrapped it in, and the mashed green plaintains that made up the masa base was soooo mouth-melting soft. I often wish that pasteles would be available at other times other than Christmas. But if you come here, you don't gotta wait. You can have it year-round, baby! Note: The only bummer was that they seemed to have taken the mofongo off their menu. C'mon! Where is my mofongo? Bring that back!",0.9855,0.856,0.117,0.027,0.5546010296010296

I've never had one before, and I'm glad I ordered it. The fried plantains were perfect and the Puerto Rican rice was delicious.

Once upon a time it was an establishment that seemed to of been taken very seriously, but for some reason it has downgraded with not only service, but more importantly food. I am not a fan of food that is reheated and sits at the counter for more than ten minutes before coming to the table, especially when there are only about 5 patrons in the whole restaurant.  I was once a regular here but know for a fact that since owners have changed, the downgrade is evident. What ever happened to down home cooking and just plain and simple howdy you do when you come into an establishment. I just think that the aura of the place has changed. Mind you, the food at best was mediocre compared to what it use to be. Did they change chefs and/or since the other people working here are no longer here, did it just completely change altogether? I would hope that it would stay the same but alas, it is most indubitably different. (Insert sad face here)  Chicago has always been welcoming to the Latin cuisine and for that I am happy due to my culture always being represented with food and seasonings, but this time around I can't say it is so. The change is evident and the food has suffered tremendously. I shutter to the fact that although it was not crowded, it took forever to even get a glass of water (and did I mention the glass of water had pink lipstick stains, heck I don't use that shade of pink).  I think that was definitely the last time I come here due to the fact that there are way more Latin inspired restaurants to try instead of coming to a place that has since lost its fizzle.

2015-06-01,5.0,"Let me start off by saying if I could've give more stars I would! Yesterday the wife and I just got done doing some errands and was hungry. We were going to cook and had all intentions of doing so. We both decided we wanted Hispanic food, wasn't sure which one but we wanted it. We googled places to eat near by and every place was closed! I know it was Sunday and around 6-7pm but we couldn't find anywhere! Then my wife came across this place, so I told her lets go! What's the worst that can happen? It doesn't taste like real Puerto Ricans food and we never go there again! As soon as upon walking in the door we were greeted with a smile and told to sit where we would like to. We sat down and got water then an AMAZING bowl of their house soul! Omg!!! That soup was amazing!!! Then we were greeted by Patty, she had asked us if this was our first time there and what we ordered and we had told her a shorter version of this story lol. She immediately had a huge smile and said we made great choices. I ordered the Carne Guisiada and my wife had a steak jibarito and tostones for an appetizer. Now I've never like plantains as a kid as my mother would make me eat them (I'm half Puerto Rican lol) but once trying these I was amazed! The food was so amazing I had to order extra for my father to try because I knew he would love it! (I'm sure he misses my mothers cooking lol) needles to say we tried their home made flan as well and OMG! That melts in your mouth! Our whole experience was amazing from walking in, eating and leaving. Everyone there were sweet hearts and very helpful! We're going to make this a monthly stop no matter what! We would go weekly but we only eat out once a week lol. So we'll make this a 1-2 times a month place for sure. I'm going to take my inlaws here as well because I know for a fact they'll love here! You feel cozy and the decor makes me miss Puerto Rico so much more. Actually planning a week vacation now because of this visit lol! So thank you Patty and your amazing cooks and staff for our experience. See you all soon!  Carlos",0.9972,0.741,0.197,0.062,0.5887301587301588

2015-05-18,5.0,"Finally found a place somewhat close to LP for our Boricua food fix! There are a good number of Latin restaurants, but this one is amazing that is not in Humboldt Park and is strictly Puerto Rican. We sat ourselves and we instantly felt like we were at Abuelita Elena's. If you don't feel the love in a Puerto Rican or most Latin restaurants, then it is not legit. We get complimentary cups of chicken noodle soup and bread. That soup was delish and could have had so much more of it! Seriously heartwarming. Being newbies to the restaurant, the boo and I ordered everything, so we know for next time. We got two pasteles, a mofongo, a lechon jibarito and a chicken guisado (both with arroz con gandules) and a side of yuca al mojo. The pasteles were pretty good and definitely satisfied my craving. These are similar to tamales and had pork in them. The mofongo was quite good as well, as the accompanied sauce worked well with the garlicky pork plantain mash. I also enjoyed the jibarito (plantain sandwich) and this was pretty massive. We had to take half of it home. The arroz con gandules was very satisfying. The flavors were definitely there. The rice was just a touch over. The chicken guisado was definitely one of the highlights of the night. The sauce was a little different from what I'm used to but it was amazingly tasty. The chicken was super juicy and falling off the bone. Portion was also very satisfying. The mojo sauce was addicting and could eat that with everything. I asked for a plastic container to bottle up the remaining mojo, but the lady brought over two mojo filled containers instead. Score! The owner stopped by and chatted us for a bit. Everyone was super friendly and helpful. Didn't have to wait too long for anything.  Definitely coming back and trying some other dishes, in addition to some favorites.

2014-06-20,5.0,"I just read an article yesterday morning on the worst kind of people when it comes to eating.  Apparently being the person who always wants to share, even when the other party isn't planning on it, is frowned upon.  I wouldn't know.  I pretty much always get my way. Anyhow, that article made me think of all the wonderful dishes I would have missed out on if I didn't always SUGGEST sharing.  I mean, I would never flat out say ""you get that and I'll get this and we can share"".  Alright, I would, because that's typically how it goes down, but it almost always pays off. I tried half a steak jibarito and half of the lechon and both were exactly as I'd hoped.  I don't like to give Mark G credit for pretty much anything, but his review where he describes the cheese as a chihuahua/mozzarella type is spot on.  It's creamy and thickish, yet melts wonderfully, and I have no clue what it actually is.  While jibaritos are one of my favorite foods, the American cheese they put on it typically makes me gag.  Way to switch it up La Cocina!  Way to switch it up. Even though it wasn't my special day, I ordered like it was.  That means when I heard ""I want guachitos, you'll like them,"" my mind was thinking ""blahblahblah, papa rellena"".  Look, you either need to come here starving, or come here looking for two meals from one.  The portions are pretty big, especially when you consider the prices.  Additionally, they give you chicken soup and bread.  Before the jibaritos even came out, I was basically full and ready to go home and put on sweatpants.  I didn't though.  We still had beer to drink and it would be a travesty to have two types of jibaritos placed in front of you and not try them fresh from the kitchen.  Both meats were very tender and very flavorful.  The nice thing about La Cocina is that instead of making one giant jibarito and cutting it in half, they make two smaller (and I use that word loosely) ones.   The only thing I wasn't crazy about was their arroz con gandules.  I might be spoiled from growing up with a Puerto Rican best friend whose grandma makes the best rice I've ever had, but theirs had a weird taste I couldn't put my finger on.  It wasn't bad, it was just too noticeably different for my liking. La Cocina is definitely one of my top spots for jibaritos, and the fact that it's byob is pretty sweet too.",0.9761,0.756,0.143,0.101,0.5700758142084673

Yeah, it just a chicken soup but come on, some restaurants in town cannot even provide any decent chicken soup. This was delicious. My main entry, it was really tasty and the amount was perfect. My 4-year-old daughter had chicken empanada. I had some bites of that and that was also great. It was decent size with big pieces of shredded chicken. And oh boy.... I fell in love with the sauce! I guess, it was chimichuri sauce? Lots of, yes, lots of garlic, cilantro, oil, etc... this sauce was a killer to me. I even put the rest on my steak and finished all : )  It's BYOB.

2014-03-05,4.0,"After searching through yelp I came across this place, and saw the pretty awesome reviews. Being pretty familiar with the area I decided I would try it out and see what all of the fuss was about. I came on a Sunday evening around 6pm, and there was a fairly decent crowd. The place is self-seating style, so of course I chose the seat closest to the kitchen to smell all of the deliciousness!! The restaurant has a very cozy feel, with lots of Puerto Rican memorabilia hanging around on the walls.  A few minutes after sitting down, we were greeted by a very friendly waitress who asked us if we had any questions about anything on the menu. After asking for more time, she came back a few minutes later with literally the most amazing chicken soup I've ever tasted. Generally I'm not a fan of chicken soup, but this was amazing! So after my indecisiveness started to kick in, I decided to practice some Spanish and ask for some suggestions. The look on the waitresses face was priceless! It was like ""este moreno habla español?"" Haha. But back to the review.  I ended up ordering the Combo Caribe (Pork Chop/Chuleta, Tamal, Tostones, and arroz con gandules) along with ""Guachitos"" for an appetizer. One word.....DELICIOUS!!! The guachitos (tostón, guacamole & salami) had the perfect blend of flavors! The combo caribe gave me everything I wanted (definitely use the salsa de ajo on the tostones...AMAZING)! I must say that I am now obsessed with ""tropi-coco"" (a carbonated coconut drink). I literally went out and bought a case after I left haha.

Their soup is super good as well and would be good for a hangover as well.

They also serve complimentary chicken noodle soup and bread when you dine.  I thought it was a nice touch.  Dinner has never been this inexpensive for us in the city - only $20 for both of us!   There's a huge cooler of sodas, including Jarritos (they have pineapple!) and Mexican non-alcoholic sangria. Don't worry about the mouthful of the name of this place.  La Cocina's menus are in Spanish and English.

But it's so hard to choose, with the insane amount of restaurants to choose from. So it became one of those random point on the yelp map picks.  So after a quick ride down the Fullerton bus, we arrived at Cocina Boricua. The place looks like any other cute mom + pop owned place- lots of random pictures all over the walls, a small waterfall in the corner, and a cute little bar. We were immediately greeted by a bunch of smiling faces as we walked in, and the place was not very crowded at 7pm on a Sunday. The place is BYOB, and as soon as the waitress saw that we had a bottle of wine she brought out two glasses and a corkscrew for us. So nice of her :) She was patient with us as we debated over the many tasty options on the menu. We started off with some empanadas (beef and chicken), they were good, the chicken was one of the best empanadas I've ever had. I finally decided on what was recommended by many yelpers: the steak jibarito. The boyfriend ordered the pork with plantains. She brought us out some bread, but none of the soup that everyone talked about.  Our food came out quickly, everything was hot and delicious. The jibarito was amazing (you actually get two sandwiches, each a full meal for me), every bite melted in my mouth. The plantains were crispy and the rice was good. The pork was really good, nice and tender.  After we finished our meal, paid our check and left a tip, we still had a bit of wine to finish so we stayed and talked.

We were on our way to a show downtown and were not able to go to the nearby place we had planned to because we didn't think we'd be able to get out fast enough. So we drove down Fullerton a couple of blocks and ""settled"" on the Puerto Rican place that advertised the best Jibaritos in Chicago. What's a Jibarito?  A sandwich made with fried plantains (tostones) instead of bread.  As my wife and I love tostones - we lived in the Dominican Republic for a while and grew to love them - this was like a dream.  I ordered the lechon (roast pork) jibarito while she went for the Cubano -with roast pork, ham and cheese. Oh my! The roast pork was amazing.  With cheese and a sauce flavoring it perfectly, and large tostones sandwiching the meat, the flavors oozed out wonderfully.  Both sandwiches were amazing.  And they came with soup and rice.  (The chicken soup was definitely home made, with a great stock, lots of chicken, and plenty of noodles.  Great tastes.) Before we got to the jibaritos, we had appetizers - I had a chicken empanada, with a nice crunchy crust and a good homemade filling.  My wife, showing her love for both tostones and guacamole, chose the Guachitos, They were wonderful - a heaping serving of guacamole on top of a fried plantain chip, topped by one of the best tasting slices of sausage I've ever had. (Yeah, we shared.)  This was a generous order - 3 pieces with guac overflowing the entire chip We brought our own beers to the BYOB restaurant, which looks like a divey diner inside.  This place is nothing fancy, but the home cooking, and relaxed serving by the owners, is a great find. We didn't have time for desserts but the next time we stop in, we're going to try the flan. The rest of the menu looks great - with a number of choices of steak (carne asada), pollo, lechon, and seafood (mariscos).  Combinations look great, and we're looking forward to going back.   Oh, did I mention that the prices are amazing with nothing more than $14 on the menu.  This place isn't fancy, but its very good.",0.9969,0.804,0.186,0.01,0.6625417175417175

I frequent another popular puerto rican restaurant (on california) and had my doubts about trying some place new. Boy was I wrong.  To be on the safe side I went with the jibarito and an order of tostones and decided I would gage my opinion of La Cocina Boricua on that. The meat in the jibarito was very tender and everything about it was great! Unlike some other reviews I don't need the plantains to be greasy. I actually prefer if my hands aren't dripping with oil after taking a bite. Having said that the tostones were also great. The fact that they give you a side of the mojo instead of slathering the tostones in it is great. I can control how much oil and garlic goes on each piece.  The atmosphere is as others have said very comforting and has a ""grandmas house"" feeling. The sweet older woman greets you and makes sure you have everything you need. I ordered for take out and was pleasantly surprised that my order was ready in 5 min! By the time I walked over my order was ready. I'm used to waiting 10-15 minutes for jibaritos. Overall I would have to say that this place definitely has beat out my previous favorite. I will be coming back here (seeing as its walking distance for me) and plan to pass the word.

Not to mention, I love that I can enjoy a Malta with my meal and the arroz con gandules (Puerto Rican rice with pigeon peas). Scooooore!

I also plan my excursions at night, so I don't have to worry about pesky inner-city traffic gobbling up precious minutes as I speed home to eat my jibarito while it's still hot. Fresh meat for the taking, indeed! Next comes the seduction. I grease my server by leaving a fat carry-out tip (I consider 20% for carry-out fat, anyway) in plain sight before she even places the order. Now the waiting begins. :::::fast forward fifteen minutes::::: I get home and assemble the prizes with the precision of a surgeon - for maximum pleasure, all the components must be properly plated, napkins galore should be at the ready and by now you've changed into comfy clothing you don't mind mussing. Show time! Start by minding the accessories - in this case, small nibbles of the flavor-packed Puerto Rican rice and scoops of the super chunky guacamole (wow) on a chip or three. By now, I'm warmed up and ready for the pièce de résistance, my hunky jibarito. I bite, I chew, I'm... I'm.. I'm......!*%$@... hitting about an 8 on the pleasure scale.  What keeps this jibarito from being a perfect 10? There's just not enough garlic... I like a palpable presence and save for a few bites, garlic was a no-show. But, the meat was really impressive (they don't skimp and it isn't fatty) as was the proportion of cheese and mayo. And the plantains? They were cooked to a nice crisp and held up quite well, down to the last bite. Actually, this is a jibarito you could eat in the presence of the opposite sex without much worry of lookin' a fool.

The first time I came here I had actually already eaten dinner, so I just got the appetizer Canoa, which is fried sweet plantain with ground beef and cheese. Despite already being stuffed, I ate the entire thing. It was DELICIOUS, and everything else I've eaten there since has been delicious too. But before I get off track, let me start at the beginning. This is a real family owned restaurant. I'm talking local and authentic. A super homey atmosphere as soon as you walk in. They have a few booths up by the windows in front (prime seating), a bunch of tables, and I believe they even have a patio in back. It is BYOB (major cool points) and they have these awesome owl wine openers that totally remind me of that Hungover Owls website. But I digress. They start you off with fresh bread, butter and delicious chicken noodle soup (for FREE!). Their appetizers are all good. Canoa, as I've mentioned, is my favorite. The tostones are also yummy. Going on to main dishes, their steak is phenomenal. I've had the steak dinner with onions - amazing. My boyfriend had the steak with cheese - to die for.

2010-09-19,2.0,"I walked into La Cocina Boriqua de la Familia Galarza one quiet Saturday afternoon, and I really did feel like I was a guest in someone's home. I ordered canoa (sweet plantain filled with beef), a jibarito with ham and cheese, and banana bread pudding --TO GO.  While waiting for my food I used the washroom. Walking passed the kitchen, I noticed this place truely is family operated. The ambiance of the place is one of comfort and time honored tradition --very welcoming and clean. My carryout food results, on the other hand, weren't so pleasing.  I envisioned the ham and cheese jibarito to be a toasty warm sandwich with a bit of grease on the grilled plantain stuffed with grilled onions, melted cheese and semi-charred toasted ham. What I actually received was dry and tasteless pile of loosely put together ingredients. The plantain 'walls' of this sammy were cold, dry and tasteless with a stale crunchy texture-- as if they had been taken out of a package of highly preserved pre-made plantain 'chips'. The remainder of the jibarito consisted of mayo and shredded iceberg lettuce + 3 pieces of lunchmeat ham and a slice of semi-melted non-descript white cheese product. Huge disappointment. The canoa was better than the sandwich in that it was really greasy. Never thought I'd commend a dish for being greasy, but after that ultra dry jibarito, the moisture in this canoa was pleasing. Although the beef wasn't seasoned enough (if at all), the grilled plantain had a nice natural sweetness to it. I hear there is some sort of mojo sauce that everyone loves. I wasn't given any mojo (perhaps because I wasn't dining in), but I can imagine a garicky oil drizzled on this canoa would have complimented the sweet plantain well and offer flavor to the beef. The banana bread pudding slice was a well assembled bread pudding, but would have been better served warm with a drizzle of custard than cold and dry.  If I return to La Cocina Borique de La Familia Galarza, I will dine in rather than take out, order steak or pork jibarito instead of ham, and be sure to get a taste of that mojo sauce everyone is drooling over.",0.9918,0.832,0.146,0.021,0.5619544997486174

HA!), so I'll blame the mouthwatering, make-me-love-you jibarito sandwich at LCBFG. Of course. My secrets come spilling out... He dared to pick the restaurant for perhaps the second time in our ""courtship."" The first? Chez Joel in Little Italy LAST September. Well done, and thus he was entrusted again.

It seems to be the case. Let's eat. With real wine glasses, and all that stuff.  But, you say...this isn't a review of Knew, is it? No, in fact...it is not. I'm sure there are no jibaritos on the menu at Knew.  In this case, we did go INTO Knew...and had forgotten a bottle of wine (BYOB for the record). Noting the somewhat stuffy undertones, we skipped a few blocks east on Fullerton to Bucktown Liquors, and meandered past La Cocina Boricua de la Familia Galarza. Mmmmmmmm, jibaritos. Of which, he'd never really tried. Could this be true? An entire year with yours truly...and not one voyage to jibaritoTOWN? Remedy this, we shall...yes?  And I won't get any sappier than that. We traded a classy dinner over a medium priced bottle of red at Knew for plastic table clothes, neon signs, a friendly Puerto Rican mama/owner, a 6-pack of beer (BYOB and Bucktown Liquors is next door, obvs), a split jibarito sandwich (A MUST TRY) with all the glorious sides and a batch of lottery tickets.  He called it a Puerto Rican Big Mac. (happily) I called it cheaper than a ""real"" Big Mac. (comes it at around $4) We won $14 in lottery tickets.  They cost $20.

She and I needed to get some grub in our bellies prior to heading to Quenchers for BAS. This place was in proximity, had great reviews, and as an added bonus, also served fried chicken. Done and done.  This place is no frills, which is one of the things I like about it, and it's family owned and operated.  We both got fried chicken which came with rice on the side, and free soup to start. The soup was good and really flavorful.  I enjoyed the chicken as well. At first I was dismayed at not being given a breast as part of the four pieces, but in the end, it was more than enough food to fill me up, and at $8.95, the price was right. It was just the right foundation for the drinks that were in our future. Service is casual and friendly, and you definitely feel like you're in someone's kitchen.  They serve both Coca Cola and Pepsi products in cans. To me, nothing tastes better than Coke from a can.  3.5 stars.",0.9499,0.831,0.125,0.045,0.5398214285714287

I came in with my sister the other day for lunch and we ordered the steak jibarito with arroz con gandules.  We also ordered the pasteles with white rice and beans.  For dessert, we both had the flan which was really good.  As for the jibarito, it was ok, but needed more mayo and seasoning on the steak to offset the mellowness of the plantain.  However, the steak was very tender and the onions were great.  If they had brought out some garlic and oil to dunk our sandwiches into because we absolutely love mojo, then we would have been in absolute heaven.     The pasteles were delicious and those definitely get 3 stars.  Our biggest issue was ironically with the rice.  The white rice and the arroz con gandules were surprisingly dry compared to the first few times I came here which was years ago.  The reason for the 2 star review is even though some components of our meal were quite tasty, I have to judge the meal in its entirety which unfortunately was just average.   Having had Puerto Rican food many times before, I'm used to their rice being more of the medium grain variety and offering more of a denser mouthfeel to it, rather than the loose, lighter, longer grain variety, which reminded me more of a Mexican rice.  If you're not sure what I'm talking about, El Ponce Restaurant which is about 3 miles west of La Cocina Boricua (also on Fullerton) offers arroz con gandules and white rice with beans.  Their rice is more of the medium grain variety and when mixed with the beans, the steamy rice absorbs all the delicious beany, garlicky, saucy goodness. We were offered free soup and bread at the start of the meal which was great.  The soup was delicious with noodles and veggies in it, but the bread that was offered wasn't warm.  It was very crusty and I think if it had come out warm, it would've been absolutely delicious.  I've been to a few restaurants that actually toasted their bread, buttered it up and slathered it in garlic which is awesome.  If La Cocina Boricua did that, they would definitely get 2 more stars for it. Overall, the restaurant is absolutely charming, the service is wonderful and the owner is just a beautiful lady inside and out.  However, the food unfortunately, was average at best and I hope that if the owner visits Yelp and sees this review, that she knows that this long time fan of hers hopes that she can bring her restaurant back to what it once was.  Back in the day, no other PR restaurant could hold a candle to La Cocina Boricua.  I guess we'll all have to just wait and see.   Winner, winner, I'll give it a few months before I come back for a jibarito dinner!",0.9994,0.741,0.228,0.031,0.5031062635540249

I am talking about the jibarito!  The jibarito that I fell in love with, with the choice of either being socially included or exiled from any human interaction because of the rich thick delicious smell of garlic so thick you feel like you are eating garlic still, as well as the recipient, that comes from each and every exhale.  Now that is the jibarito that I know of, and I loved it! This my friends is a good jibarito but its not the one that made me get excited at the thought of a jibarito.  Yes it had excellent and I do mean perfectly fried plantains, crispy just excellent.  Yes it was dripping with its own juiciness, aka grease.  And the steak was great, tender, nicely cooked.  I was excited and took my first bite only to feel empty and disappointment by it.  It was missing that key ingredient that made this special.  After two bites, the waitress brings out diced garlic in oil and the light bulb went off.  This was why!  So the jibarito was great afterwards but still the sandwich just wasn't drenched in garlic as it should be.  That every bite you know that flavor of garlic will linger on your tongue and that was what it was missing.  Yes the garlic was there but it aint on my breath nor do I taste it now like I had before.  Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but this is my experiences with jibarito and this is what I expect in my jibarito. So I would say I enjoyed it but wasn't blown away or enjoyed it like i would have hoped. I also chose to get the PR rice and it was sooooo dry to the point where my friends and I were mixing the rice with the leftover grease on our plates, the salsa, and the garlic to put some flavor and moisture in it. Well other than those points, we did get complimentary chicken noodle soup (kinda bland), salsa and chips which was great.  And we also got flan which was pretty good, but there was a bit of a crust that was soggy, either way it was still good and tasty.

The mofongo had good garlic flavor, BUT was WAY TOO OILY- way too oily-I ate about 1/3 of it...  It was just too greasy too keep eating-to the point where I pressed down on the mofongo and it oozed oil-NOT good eats.   The red beans were lacking in the flavor-very flat taste -almost like they didn't season it at all.  My friend had maduros, arroz con gandules & the fried king fish.  She is also familiar with good PR food and thought that the maduros were awesome, BUT found the rice was dry and the fish was just ok, not seasoned enough and that she's had better : (   All in all - if you are looking for an awesome, just like mom used to make PR place-this is not it and that is why I will not be coming back here.  If you are not familiar with dr or pr food you will probably find it sufficiently tasty-but if you know the real thing and are looking for it - you will not be happy here.  So I will continue the search for a ""good & tasty"" puerto rican restaurant in Chicago...to be continued. PS- I am a fan of the dominican restaurant ""Tropical Taste""- it has a very limited menu and is a hole in the wall, but it delivers the flavors that are dead on dominican (a good thing)- well seasoned, flavorful, juicy meat.  My favorite thing to get is the roasted chicken with the steamed yucca topped with grilled onions...tasted like my mom or grandma made it! yum...",0.969,0.834,0.12,0.046,0.5302267573696144

Here is why: The cheese. Most other places use american Kraft singles, and it really butchers what would otherwise be a great sandwich. But La Cocina uses white cheese. Something along the lines of Chihuahua or mozzarella, and it makes for a kick ass sandwich. Another thing that makes this place better are the portion sizes. One jibarito here is is about the same size as two from other places. It's huge! And they definitely dont snub you on any of the ingredients. Also, it wont leave you smelling like garlic for three days either.  Service is quite friendly here also. I believe it was the owner and his daughter as I came in here a little after 12pm.

One of my oldest friends was in town and I wanted to take him to a cool spot that was pure Chicago but not hip.  He was staying downtown, so I first thought I'd have to work my magic in the loop.  When his sister showed up with her truck, I knew it was on and poppin' in Bucktown.  We descended on the spot on a slow Sunday night.  There was only one family in the dining room when we arrived.  We walked in, our waitress greeted us with a smile and nodded us towards a booth.  We slid in and started to drool. I knew from reading past reviews that whatever we ordered, I had to have some of that garlic oil.  More on that later.  Our waitress (I am blanking on her name; forgive me!!) was very friendly and talkative.  She brought over some chips and salsa (I know) and suggested some great appetizers and humored my Spanglish and terrible accent.  The one thing I didn't need help ordering was a beverage: Pineapple Jarrito and keep 'em coming! A short while later, we were greeted with sugary fruit soda and our apps:  an order of the appetizer combo platter (natch), the garlic oil, a plate of fried pork (on the house) and an order of guachitos.  What are guachitos?  They are what will change your life and set you free.  Picture it: tostone, topped with guacamole (don't trip) TOPPED WITH SAUSAGE!  My friend and his sister almost lost fingers trying to reach for them.  I wasn't playing around.  And the garlic oil.  Words fail.  Dunk it, drizzle it, sop it...do whatever.  You can't go wrong.  How something so simple can taste so good and make everything it touches pop with flavor...masterful.  The waitress walked up, laughed at us eating and attacking each other, conversed in Spanglish and told us our meals were coming up. I ordered a Chicken Jibarito (w/a side of rice) and it was the best I've had.  Really.  When she dropped off the food, my Texan friend (tall, red head, very Irish looking) said, ""Gracias.""  She then responded in some rapid fire Spanish none of us caught.  She smiled, then looked at me sorta crazy and said, ""You don't speak Spanish??!?""

Puerto Rican food is not that spicy, and more like Spanish food than Mexican food (note all of the garlic and olive oil I mentioned above).  It's hearty, homey comfort stuff - it doesn't leave you feeling gross when you are done and is probably a little more healthy vs other cuisines, albeit super caloric!

The empanadas were made to satisfy and they did. They sure did. They were nice, big and filling.  The service was great. Our server was super friendly and attentive. It was BYOB so we finished off a bottle of red wine and conveniently enough, there was a liquor store next door. Our classy friend, Sean, returned with a 6 pack of Miller Lights. Yesss!  Our server kept them nicely chilled in the fridge and served up a new ML whenever necessary.  The chips and salsa were delicious. The salsa made my eyes water and throat burn. It's one of those pleasurable, tasty pains. I can handle. Great service, BYOB and great value for the food. TWO THUMBS UP! The location was a bit out of the way but our classy friend, Sean (Miller Light 6 pack man) is moving 4 blocks away so we will return! For dessert--try the flan.

For an appetizer, we ordered tostones (double-fried plaintains with garlic).  If you haven't had these before, they're not the sweet plaintains, but the green ones that are unripe.  I love the chopped garlic in olive oil that comes with the plaintains.  Really good stuff!   For only $20 for 2 people, the tostones and the steak jibarito meals (which comes with rice, soup, and bread) was a great deal.  And everything was delicious!  It's also BYOB.",0.9839,0.795,0.194,0.011,0.5928571428571427

Both came w/ PR style rice w/ pigeon peas. All entrees come w/ soup and bread or chips I believe.  Of course we finished off w/ a flancito.  We ate and drank like kings and the price was very reasonable.  (By the way, it's BYOB and there is a lovely liquor store next door).  My husband made friends w/ the lady who cooks, who like him is from Ecuador. The second time we got the carne asada and grilled pork chops again. The waitress remembered my husband and wasn't mad when I spilled beer all over the table (what a clutz).

Puerto Rican Heaven! :)  BTW, when we get to heaven, there will be Salsa music and La Cocina Boricua.  Just thought I would let you in on that secret.  I just moved to the Chicago area and I tried a little Puerto Rican place in Elgin.  It was good.  Nothing to complain about.  BUT... then I went to La Cocina Boriqua today and FUHGETTABOUTIT.  I will drive all the way in to the city for this place, probably a least once a week.  My cousin was w/us today, visiting from the Bronx.  He gets great Puerto Rican food all the time... and he was more than impressed.  Well, actually... he was soooo full from shoveling it down that he literally had to unbuckle his belt while we were still there in the restaurant.  Caramba.  It took us back to childhood. FANTASTIC, OUTSTANDING FOOD!! ***PS: I highly recommend the Bistec encebollada (Steak & onions), the Puerto Rican rice (arroz con gandules).  I also highly recommend their pasteles.  If you don't know, pasteles are a similar concept to tamales but instead of masa, we use yautia, potatoes & plantains.  Pasteles, in my family, are the end all and be all of all foods.  Holidays aren't right, without them!! :)  Their grilled chicken was awesome, too.  And the platanos!!  Dang.  My grandmother made great platanos, but I believe that la Familia Galarza has her beat... especially w/the garlic that comes with it.  Omigosh.  I'm getting hungry again.  Thank God my brother forgot to take the frozen pasteles (that we got at the restaurant)  w/him, when he left.  I think I'll go eat.  :)",0.9948,0.796,0.198,0.006,0.6351841269841269

2007-05-28,5.0,"If you truly knew your food, you would know that no matter what the snob foodies say about finding the best dining experience at places at Alinea, you go home to Mom to re-discover gastronomical nirvana. Where else are you served comfort food so good it tugs at your heart en route to your digestive tract, with impeccable service that includes free second (and third) helpings and reminders to eat your greens? If moms were on Iron Chef, ""love"" would be an ingredient they'd have to work with. Instead of fantasising about your next meatloaf or laksa (Singaporean noodle dish in light coconut gravy that my mom embellishes with lavish helpings of seafood), perhaps you can indulge in Norman Bates moments at La Cocina Boriqua. Now, I'm not sure why it's listed as Cocina Degalarza Inc. on  yelp.com  -- Degalarza is the surname of the family who run this Logan Square storefront, but the signboard is clearly La Cocina Boriqua (you may be trying to find it on  metromix.com  as La Cocina Criolla -- it's the same place).  All confusion aside, familiarity sets in when you take your seat as matronly ladies come by and serve you chips and salsa and tomato-based chicken soup for the soul. They happily explain anything you might have questions about on the menu, and recommend the good stuff -- maybe you might find it pushy, but with that smile and gentle insistence, it's like my mom asking if I'd like braised oxtail for dinner, but with undertones of ""Yes, we're having braised oxtail for dinner."" They take turns coming by to ask if everything is OK, and as I vacuum up the yellow rice (rice Puerto Rican style with saffron and peas), offer to bring me more rice on the house. We shared an appetiser combination platter of tostones (fried savoury plantain), canoca (sweet plantain filled with beef), relleno de papa (potato filled with beef), empanada, maduro (fried sweet plantain), and mofongo (mashed fried plantain). For my dinner, I had cabrito en fricase (baby goat stewed in wine) and (hopefully future Yelper) Caroline S. had a pollo jibarito, grilled chicken sandwiched between two pieces of fried plantains. Our selections were heartily applauded, and when we couldn't finish our appetiser platter because our gluttony was spent on our entrees, it was insisted that we take leftovers to go even though we had declined a couple of times already. Everything was so good I'm afraid to tell my real mom about this place -- I don't want her to feel slighted or envious. Now, we were full, but there's always room for dessert. Although my default Latino dessert is always flan, I was open to exploring other items that I'd seen floating around the room and in the fridge -- things that involved tall sundae glasses. However, the surrogate moms said to have the flan because it was home-made, you know. Mom knows best, and of course she was right. The flan was delicious and if I saved room for dessert as well as I did for my IRA, I'd be wealthy by now.",0.9968,0.835,0.14,0.025,0.5245509607351714
2007-04-01,5.0,"Off the beaten track, this family run Puerto Rican restaurant exudes warmth & hospitality. The small dining room is inviting, romantically lit & adorned, with the feel of actually dining in a local eatery in P.R. The two women who run it, one apparently doubles as Cook, are friendly & attentive making you feel right at home. As soon as you are seated, a complimentary tasty bowl of meaty noodle soup arrives with bread. The Menu is classic P.R. (carribean) fare, with many pork & chicken dishes, stews, & grilled steaks. But, don't skip the appetizers, esp. the Combo for $7.95 - includes oh-so-tasty Empanadas, Alcapurria (deep fried mix of ground plaintains, taro root, & ground beef), Maduros (fried sweet plantain), Tostones (plain fried plaintain), and delicious Relleno de papa (potato filled pastry with beef in the middle). Also don't miss the homemade hot sauce accompaniment. For main courses, our choices of Carne Guisada (Beef Stew) and Carbrito an Fricase (a stew of baby goat cooked in special wine sauce), were wonderful & perfect for a snowy Chicago night. Main courses are very reasonably priced from 7.95-9.95. Popular with the locals, are sandwiches, including steak, chicken, roast pork, & ham & cheese for only $5.95. Best of all, it's BYOB.
