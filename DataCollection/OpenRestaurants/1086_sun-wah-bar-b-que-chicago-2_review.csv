2017-08-23,3.0,"Maybe I should have tried the Beijing Duck Feast, but I just wasn't impressed with Sun Wah as I wanted to be. Fearing that the duck feast would be too much food, I ended up trying the Roast Duck, BBQ Pork, and Roast Pork over rice.  I found the duck to be too salty and lacking the tenderness I had anticipated. The BBQ pork was good, but just on par with other places I've had. The Roast Pork was okay - definitely not the best I've had.  My fiancé was more impressed with his Beef Chow Fun. I tried it, but I didn't find it to be that great. Perhaps my standards for Chinese restaurants are high, but I tend to compare the Chinese food I have in the States with the Chinese food I have in China. Obviously, I don't expect China quality, but I do expect to be better than just okay. Would I try Sun Wah again? Sure. But I'm not going to be running back on a future Chicago visit.

They were out of the BBQ pork, any duck dishes and pretty much anything other than soy sauce chicken and roast pork. The roast pork was good with crispy skin. It had lots of fat marbled in which I wasn't a huge fan of, and parts of the skin felt a little tough under the crunch indicating not as fresh. The overall flavor was still pretty good though and salty. Tried friend's soy sauce chicken which was pretty much boiled chicken with soy sauce, and felt no need for a second piece.  Also ordered the beef stew noodle soup, which I will state is NOT a stew. Do not get misled like I did. The stew refers to the beef being stewed - which had an odd flavor and was mostly tendons and fat. Noodles themselves were the thin egg noodles and soup was pretty light. Wasn't a fan.  I can see Sun Wah having potential if I get in early enough and can order a variety of BBQ meats, but from my first experience, wouldn't expect it to blow my socks off.",0.5373,0.877,0.063,0.06,0.6150641025641025

First off, I am not a duck fan. Had some duck dishes in the past and didn't like it. Tried many times, but its a bit too gamey for me. But then I tried the aforementioned dishes and they were all very tasty! But the roast duck with the bao, daikon and the sweet sauce - YUMMY!!! Okay, the gamey taste of duck was a bit diluted from the bao and stuff, but it was a delicious combination. The accompanied duck broth and duck fried rice was also tasty and freshly made. Service: In a word: Efficient. The nice young lady who served us (and burnt her fingers, bless her) expertly and quickly cut the duck in many slivers, then the wings and other portions so we can easily eat them. She was also friendly and seemed gung ho on doing her job, with many refills of drinks and made sure we were okay. Misc: Its kinda like a shared open space, like a cross of being in a warehouse and a large and well furnished place, like Bob Chin's. Its functional, without too much on decor, but that can definitely be excused because I came to eat, and not for the atmosphere. Okay, its a bit loud here, but that's why its so good and popular. Takeaway to home is also very much an option as we had quite a bit of leftovers (also yum too!). Paid parking is available on the streets, and had no problems with the neighborhood despite I was there rather late at night (11pm). This one is definitely a place to come back too!

The manager I spoke to apologized but didn't seem to understand the seriousness of the situation--I had to explain that after handling hundreds of dirty dishes with their bare hands, including ours, then boxing up our leftovers with those dirty bare hands it seriously compromised the leftovers with potential contamination from any of the other customers dirty dishes.

I was appalled at the managers lack of understanding of BOTH how her restaurant staff functions and basic hygiene. The bus people clearing tables are not in a position to go wash their hands and return to a table to box leftovers, they should not be touching customers food.

Your restaurant is not just simple Chinese take out place anymore.  You can't provide below average service to your customers. Please have some respect and appreciation  for your customers.   Last week I had most ridiculous experience ever occurred to me in my dining experience.   But unfortunately this is also not the only time or first time this kind of experience happened to us at Sun Wah.  One of the food runner ladies brought us large plate with duck. Unfortunately she was poorly trained, and literary dropped plate on the table, and spilled duck juice/sauce all over the table, and without a single word just left us.  Amazing !!!!   We understand, accidents happens, but DROPPING/TROWING  a PLATE spilling sauce all over, and just rudely    walking away??This is  just too rude, too bad, unacceptable .  I called her afterwards, no response !!!    Again, OMG she turns around with most angriest look on her face and yells at us WHAT ??? WHAT YOU WANT?  WAIT !! and ads some profanities on Spanish.  I couldn't believe my ears, but also couldn't believe this kind of things tolerated by management of restaurant.  If she can say something like this to customers, that means Management allows them to do so??? Or doesn't have an any idea what's going on on  their restaurant floor.  And this is not the only occasion, we've had several rude encounters before, food runners and busboys, busladies are always angry  , very rude. Always.  One look at them and you just want to leave this place for a happier restaurant experience. This is why I come here now may be once or twice a year.  I am always afraid to  ask them for something extra like sauce or rice on side.  Because of the look and hated mumbling they give you every time. Please work on /do something about your service, hire a professional service trainers or something.  You have great food, but embarrassingly bad service.   If you care.

Yum, these two items are always good. I sometimes order the curry shrimp here, but I'm not always satisfied because they don't give you that many pieces of shrimp. So I typically go for the 1/4 duck on rice with Chinese broccoli and an egg. It's so good and filling! Especially when you add the two different spicy condiments they give you if you ask for it. One has tiny green Thai chilies floating in soy sauce and the other is a red chili paste with seeds. These sauces compliment any rice order you can get at Sun Wah, so make sure you get some!",0.9355,0.868,0.106,0.026,0.47655228758169926

You might want to get multiple ducks for larger parties. You may fight over who gets the drumsticks.  Service was on par of maybe a Chinese dennys. The servers are there. Walking around busily tending other tables. You might have to flag someone down for service, but at least you have yummy food to chow down on while you wait. And they don't have attitude. They are polite and courteous. Just very busy and may not notice you.  Chili peppers unfortunately are not very spicy. Luckily we brought our own.  Bartender was nice. Very nice actually.

I've also had their BBQ Pork and Chicken Over Rice, Beef Fried Rice and Salted Egg Congee. All very delicious and highly recommended. Keep in mind that the food portions are really big. You could feed 2-3 people with their serving sizes but if you're one with an appetite, I say go big or go home :)  I gave this place a 4 star rating because though the food is incredible, service could be a little better. Just today, my family and I had to wait at least 20 minutes for them to bring our to-go boxes and get us the check.

2017-04-17,5.0,"First things first - this review is only regarding the Beijing Duck Dinner meal at Sun Wah. That is because in the 15-20 times that I've visited the place, that is the only thing that sticks out as memorable. And oh what fond memories they are. Sun Wah BBQ is not a fancy establishment. They don't have the nicest decor, or the best waitstaff. Their bathrooms are pretty dirty and usually lack hot water. They've been shut down from time to time, probably for health code violations. The parking is often hard to get since it's on a busy street. Yet none of these things matter, not even remotely. That's because Sun Wah does one thing very very well - roast a duck. Here's how that experience unfolds. You walk in to Sun Wah, and you wait around till someone notices you and gets you a table. You are given a few menus - feel free to set them aside. The next time an employee walks past your table - inform them that you'll be having the duck dinner. If you're inclined to try something else with your dinner, go ahead. You probably won't remember it anyway. A few minutes later, someone wheels over a roasted duck to you. They proceed to slice and dice it to carve out thin, crispy pieces of skin and juicy duck meat on to a plate. This is your moment to instagram, to snapchat. In a few moments, your fingers are going to be covered in duck grease. Once the duck is on the table, someone drops off a few hot asian buns and vegetables. You lather a bit of hoisin sauce on the buns, add some veggies and some meat, and take your first bite. You're in love. You don't understand why the duck tastes this good, and you don't question it. You experiment by changing the ratio of duck:veggies:sauce, maybe you even add a little chili oil to your next bun. You think this is it - your $40 was worth it.  Then out of nowhere, someone drops off a fragrant dish of duck fried rice right in front of you. You panic. You weren't ready for this. You look over at the remaining duck - did you leave enough to eat with the rice? Does it matter if it's already duck fried rice? Should you stop eating these delicious buns? You risk it all and take a bite out of the fried rice and are immediately transported to duck heaven. You notice that your entire group has fallen silent, and are solely focused on downing this delicious meal. You don't complain. As you're making your way through the fried rice, roast duck, and buns, someone drops off a steaming bowl of duck soup. This confuses you. Shouldn't soup have come first? You try to connect the dots, realizing the duck bones in the soup came from the duck they carved up in front of you. It doesn't matter. You finish your rice, and then take a sip of the soup. By this point you suspect that you have crossed some sort of invisible duck line, that there is only so much duck you can have in one meal. As the hot soup flows down your system, you realize that once again, you were wrong.  The duck soup is cleansing. The duck soup is refreshing. The duck soup washes away all the duck fat that had built up, and leaves just enough taste to remember. You sense the creation of your first fond memory of this place. You know you'll be back again.",0.957,0.867,0.08,0.053,0.48034337544541617

The duck is mostly fat and chewy now, the oysters are market price, and the wait staff and owners have rude attitudes (minus Chuck) ;-)  I could see why one would be drawn to his place.. it's the theatrics of the presenting of the Peking duck. The Peking duck itself is better than the roasted duck. However, the accompaniments are awful. They take the carcass and make an inedible bland soup, non-existent duck in their duck fried rice, and you have a choice to get Pam fried noodles, which are incinerated.

2017-03-03,1.0,"Sun Wah used to be my go-to place. For years, I never had bad meal there, then they started getting inconsistent. Now they are downright terrible and I just ate my last meal there. It had been awhile so I hoped they sorted the kitchen out. I ordered two dishes that have always been outstanding: Steamed Oysters with Ginger and Scallions and Eggplant Stuffed with Shrimp.  The Oysters were dirty, gritty and sandy. Not only was it disgusting to eat but they clearly weren't cleaned! That's incredibly unsafe to serve and I'm really glad I spit out the only one I tried, because I could well have ended up in the ER from eating dirty seafood. The eggplant with shrimp used to be glorious umami, savory, shrimpy goodness. Now it's greasy, bland, salty and the shrimp stuffing was weirdly...crunchy. Honestly just terrible.  And the service.--it was always brusque but that was part of the charm because it was fast, efficient and delivered delicious food. Now it's slow, surly and rude.

I made sure to finish every bao we got because they didn't give you very many.  Glancing at the table next to us, I was a little appalled that the party next to us had left so many untouched when they were done with their meal.  T_T My least favorite dish was the fried rice with duck. It was quite dry, making it really hard to swallow. The soup was handy to have, but it did contain lots of bones from the duck, so I wasn't a big fan of the soup either. Downside is that this meal does come with a hefty price, but we did have leftovers for a meal the next day.  Keep in mind this specialty meal is not even on the menu (not when I was there). Sun Wah BBQ was a quick walk from the train station.  The place was packed when we arrived, so there was a bit of a wait.  While there, I remember a homeless person kept coming in and outside of the restaurant, drawing attention to himself.  What drew even more attention was a staff member yelling at him to stay outside.  The incident made me feel a bit weird in how the situation was being handled.  Food and staff were great outside of that incident.",0.7099,0.893,0.061,0.046,0.46356554967666086

It seemed like they only had 3 - 4 servers for the packed house that were literally running from table to table.  We waited close another 40 minutes before we got our food. It was near impossible to get the attention of any of the servers when we needed to order more food or even get a water refill. Was the food good?  Yes and no. I really enjoyed the peking duck when I first came here and, even being a little frustrated with the service, I still thought it was very good. Our group also ordered the salted pork and the salt and pepper squid. The salted pork was okay but was hard to eat since it doesn't come with any steam buns or rice, which we were hoping to use from our duck order which came out at a much later time. The salt and pepper squid was not good and way over-salted.  At the end of the day, it is worthwhile to come here just for the peking duck. For the price, you do get a lot of food. Unfortunately, the service last Saturday was just so terrible that it is to give this place anything more than 3 stars.

2016-09-13,1.0,"We made a 8pm reservation for Sunday night for the Beijing duck.  We showed up at 810, were seated right away.  Inquired about the duck, they were out.  Ok, things happen.  We decided to stay because we were all starving and hadn't eaten since late breakfast.  Restaurant was not really busy, everyone in there was pretty much already settled and had their food.  Couple large tables and maybe a handful of small.   Standard Cantonese noodle house style fare.  We went with order of eggrolls, wonton noodle soup and five spice beef tripe lo mein.  We had our heart set on the duck and since they were out, we were going to grab a quick bite then eat elsewhere again.  Our quick bite, which in Seattle, would have taken no more then 5 minutes to prepare what we ordered, took almost an hour. After we ordered, it took about 20 minutes to get our eggrolls.  I make eggrolls myself and even if you had to make from scratch and wrap, it should be about 10 minutes then a couple minutes in the fryer.  I'll always order eggrolls when I'm starving because it's a sure bet to come out fast, except here. Typical Chinese restaurant, no service, water was only refilled once our whole time here, and that was when the eggrolls were dropped off.  We sat some more and waited.  They close at 9, it was about 850 and all around us jars were being refilled, chairs being stacked.  At the point I was ready to ask for the check, I saw the lo mein come up.  About 3 minutes later, we had our bowl of wonton noodle soup.  Needless to say, they got $0.00 tip.  First time ever.  I've worked in all kinds of Chinese restaurants too, dim sum, full service family, casual, and we still own one, so I know you got to F*** up pretty bad to get zero tip.   Eggrolls - They look big, but because they use the thick wrapper, they are very doughy.  Filled with meat shred and some veggies.  Not worth the $2.00 each Five spice beef tripe with lo mein - dry dish, served with soup on side.  This is actually the beef innards mix - tongue, intestine, tripe over wide egg noodle.  One of my favorites normally.  Okay portion size, good for one really hungry or two to share.  Everything was SOOOOO SALTY!!!!   Beef tongue was old/stored overly long in freezer.  Had a weird mushy spongy texture.  Tasted like they poured a bottle of salt and some more.  The broth is the same they use for won ton noodle.  Slight dried shrimp taste, also really salty.  My son, raised on American diet, loves broth and salt and sugar and all that good stuff, but he couldn't even finish the small bowl of broth.  They drizzled oyster sauce on top, which was overkill I think.  The best part of this dish was the plain noodles. Won ton noodle soup - I was too focused on eating my food because I was so hungry that I didn't ask how it was.  Smaller portion sized, looked like about 4 or 5 wonton and a small bunch of noodles.  I think they said it was really salty too, but again, we were starving. I'm always one to say, you go to a Chinese restaurant, don't expect service...to a point.  This place was just horrible, staff and service.",0.9927,0.861,0.106,0.033,0.462604250739844

Fortunately, Sun Wah delivered in every aspect, and we couldn't have asked for a better meal. Like others have said, you need to pre-order the Duck Dinner ($40) which comes with the bird (sliced at your table for your entertainment), duck fried rice, and duck soup. Reservations were fairly easy as this restaurant is the size of a warehouse. Perhaps we are used to the quality of service of my people, so it didn't bother us too much. In fact, we had pretty good service IMO! As for the duck, yes... you will be marveled at how it's sliced, plated, and served in front of you. If you're new to eating Peking Duck the American way, grab that fat bun, smear it with plum sauce, add some slices of duck (not forgetting the crispy skin of course), and garnish with daikon, Take one bite and you will see why everyone raves about duck so much. We also ordered a round of Heineken ($5 a bottle) and some Chinese spinach because we need some greens in our lives. Between the three of us, this was definitely enough!

The service is atrocious and the associates don't care about what you think of them at all. We've been here twice and we'll never ever come back to this Chinese Restaurant. Not to mention after doing some research this place was shut down multiple times for RODENT INFESTATION.  We arrived for approx. 30 mins before they came to take our order. A Chinese couple (probably related or a community figure) came 20 mins after that and received their meals in full about 15 mins after sitting down. That's about an hour and some change of us waiting. By then we had been waiting over a hour before we even got our first dish. Our waiter, who didn't refill our drinks once wouldn't allow us to leave until we gave her a $2.00 tip. She even lied to our face at first that it was for the duck carver guy, and then said it was because she packed our food to go for us. Thinking about this place outrages me. The most disappointing factor is that I'm an Asian-American 2nd generation US Citizen. And from my cultural upbringings there should be a sense of morality and pride in our work. We're taught to not haggle and beg for money and to work hard for our fruits of labor.

I would highly recommend that you make a reservation on a weekend as it gets pretty busy.  The Peking duck here is one of the best I've had in the states. although the duck skin can be a bit crispier, it was really tasty. The bun is nice and soft and goes really well with the meat.

Duck (10/10) 2. Fried rice (7/10) - nothing special but will give a high score for the portion they gave  3. Soup (6/10) - nothing special, but do ask for more scallions for the soup, tastes better  The second time I came (2 of us) we ordered the bar b q pork and some veggies on the side. Obviously ordered too much and regretting it as it sits waiting in the fridge.  The bbq pork wasn't that good it was cold, too - don't recommend.

As my boyfriend and I were up in Wrigleyville for a Cubs game, we decided to take advantage of being so close and venture the couple of miles to Argyle and Sun Wah. We arrived early on a Friday night, and the restaurant was busy but not completely packed yet. We snagged one of the last open tables and fortunately, did not have to wait. The dining area of Sun Wah is pretty huge, and for the entire restaurant to be packed, this was a very good sign. We were greeted with menus, waters, and as expected with any Chinese restaurant, a swift and curt ordering process. I love wonton soup and the congee on their menu looked appealing, but my boyfriend is not a huge fan of soups, so I stuck to ordering my favorite Cantonese dishes, some of my requests were even off-menu but they made them anyway! We enjoyed the following, which was obviously way too much food for the two of us: -BBQ Combo: BBQ pork, roast duck, soy sauce chicken -Beef dry flat noodles -Peiking spareribs -Salt and pepper squid The thing I love about this place is that many of their dishes come in two sizes, so we opted for a smaller size on most dishes. We would  have been wasting much more food had we been subjected to the normal full-size Chinese family servings.  There's things this place does very well, and things that are done not so well. Firstly, their BBQ is fantastic--the duck, chicken, BBQ pork--all of it was fantastic! The salt and pepper squid was good but not the best I've ever had. The Peiking spareribs were also good although slightly too sweet, and finally, the beef noodles was the worst dish of our selection--some noodles were burnt, most had fallen apart, and the flavor was not all there.

2016-04-03,4.0,"After reading that the Chicago Tribune food critic had named this as one of the best 50 restaurants in Chicago and recommended the off-the-menu Peking Duck, my son (22) and I headed there on Easter. Our reservation was for 3 pm and it was very busy. I think the entire time we were there the take out line never had less than 20 people in it. The restaurant, which is nothing fancy, but does post a sign that they passed their health inspection (always something you want to see) was about three quarters full and only seemed to have two servers. It took a very long time to get our food and even longer to get our check. The drinks and appetizers came right away but I would estimate that it took an hour for us to get the duck. It was fine because we weren't in any hurry.  The server we had was pretty funny. We ordered the duck and an order of egg rolls along with two drinks. We continued to look at the menu and she told us that was plenty of food for two people. We took her word for it and she was not lying. More than we could possibly eat. Even though it took a long time to get our order and our check we could see that she was working her butt off. I think she had half of the restaurant tables by herself. She was very personable and there was no language barrier at all.  The guy brought out the duck and carved it quickly and efficiently. He said that was probably the eightyth duck he had carved and would probably do 80 more ducks by the time they closed. He told me some days he does a couple hundred. The duck with the duck fried rice and the buns were awesome. The soup, not so much. It was pretty flavorless; it just tasted like parsley water. But the duck, oh my. There is plenty of food. We were stuffed and enough left over for each of us to have another meal. It is amazing that you get all that for $40.  It was really a lot of fun and I would highly recommend it. Just have patience and a lot of time to kill. I took off one star for the long wait.

2016-04-03,3.0,"4 stars for chicago suburbs; 3 stars for the general chinese/peking duck restaurant. Great with a group of friends - very large restaurant. I came with a group of 5. We ordered peking duck, tofu seafood casserole, cha siu, chinese broccoli, and black bean clams. Peking Duck ($40) - This is what they are known for. It isn't bad but it's also not really peking duck. This is more of the bbq duck chinese people buy as a dish for regular dinner. Peking duck has much crispier skin due to the way they cook it. (drying out the skin and roast it until super crispy). I'm probably being picky but it's an improvement area. It comes with buns (pre-bought and steams) plus garnishing. The duck also comes with duck fried rice and duck soup. This probably serves 3-4 people. Black bean clams - flavor and taste is decent but they give you a handful of clams and mix in pork. Since clams don't have a lot of meat, this dish usually gives you a big pile. Sun Wah is pretty stingy here and I guess they mix in the pork to balance it. Chinese broccoli - standard. Cha siu - a bit dry.  Tofu seafood casserole - don't order this. The seafood is likely frozen which fine. But the squid is pretty poorly cooked. There isn't a lot of seafood but a lot of tofu. It's supposed to be a lighter dish but it came out pretty bland. I would consider going back when I miss eating authentic Chinese food but I would probably order differently except for maybe the duck because it's hard to find that around here.",0.9778,0.866,0.11,0.024,0.4625228937728938

I don't know why I waited so long (3 years of knowing about it/living in the area) to explore the vast, delicious, unique, largely affordable offerings at Sun Wah Bar-B-Que. Maybe it was that I judged from the looks that Sun Wah was really only a sit-down, eating-a-huge-duck-with-multiple-people kind of place.  Clearly, Sun Wah is this, too, and it's an experience I have yet to try, but recently I have started ordering takeout for lunch, and oh my god.  Oh my god.  This isn't actually helping my physical health (but I won't deduct any stars for that!!), but the BBQ pork fried rice, the roast pork + tofu, the roast duck, the beef chow fun, the five spice tripe, the egg rolls...oh my god.  This food is so good. BBQ Pork Fried Rice - massive amount of food for $7.  Flavorful without being too greasy.  Crunchy and firm small veggies (carrots, bean sprouts, peas) and egg.  Do the BBQ Pork, it seems like it is meant for the fried rice (better than the shrimp which was admittedly underwhelming, and the duck, which overpowered the dish's main flavor). Roast Pork + Tofu: the roast pork is crispy, melt-in-your-mouth-y, rich, packed with flavor...the tofu, which other reviewers say is made in house? is firm and also flavorful.  Together they come in a brown savory sauce with some Chinese greens.  SO GOOD. Five Spice Tripe - when I order it to go, they often by default send it cold, and recommend heating it on the stove, but this isn't usually an option for me as I'm taking it for lunch or dinner at my office, microwave only.  Ask for it warm and they'll be happy to do it!  I love tripe, so this item was a no-brainer - it's perfectly seasoned with a sweet and savory spiciness that goes well on its own, with rice, and/or with veggies. Beef Chow Fun - a few times, I have accidentally received plain chow fun rice noodles (thick noodles), with beef and broccoli with gravy on top.  For me, the actual Chow Fun, stir fried noodles, is where it's at!  Just specify :)  Perfectly charred, perfectly flavored. The egg rolls - clearly made in-house (yes yes??).  Crispy wrapper, BIG, full of red meat and good veggies - so fresh and so filling and so good!! Other things I have tried - never anything un-tasty, some stuff I like much more than others, and sometimes certain things (conch special, which portion-wise is even less than the $6 fried rice, was marked at $25 /=  ) can be expensive.   Staff is GREAT!!!  Everyone is friendly, everyone is helpful.   I love Sun Wah.  Thank you guys.",0.9994,0.712,0.274,0.014,0.5224300831443691

Didn't end up getting the peking duck, as it is $40, with soup and fried rice. I just wanted the concept of making your own peking duck, didnt care about the soup and the rice. Truthfully, real peking duck is wrapped in thin crepes, not buns. We did ended up ordering a small order of roast duck($7.50) and it was quite good. The sauce goods very nice over rice. $1 for small side order of rice, $3 for medium and i think $4.50 for large.  Also got the wonton noodle soup. $5.75, the broth was very tasty, so were the wontons.  We wanted to try their lo mein, this was our least favorite. Though you are getting more authentic style lo mein, because in chinese style cuisine, lo mein literally means noodle mixed with a sauce. You get that here, bit the noodle was not very good. I could have replicate the same Noodle with my own dried noodle i have bought. Our lo mein also came with beef tendons and some you choy.  Some language barrier issues, but they are pretty advanced on their checkout system, uses ipads and is not sketchy in just writing out what you ordered by hand.

I'm not talking about (just) the food, but the service here by our waitress was probably a miracle that she did not end up horizontal by the people within our party.  When we order something, you not only didn't describe the dish(es) and proceeded to put down your variation of the dish, but upon when we receive the dish, you try to correct us and put words in our mouths, saying that it's what we ordered, when it clearly was not? Then on top of that, add in that because the food was already made, they wouldn't send it back (we didn't even request this, the waitress just flat out said it), and suggested we order an additional dish and keep the wrong dish as well (without discount or waived charge).  Of course, this is Viet town, it's the city, old schoolers, this isn't the burbs or a hospitality driven location, however, then let's proceed with the food. How does anyone mess up egg drop soup? You might as well have put in water with eggs, no broth, no salt, and call it a day. You call what you served us fried rice?? How again, does someone mess up fried rice? I'm not sure if the cooks happened to be blind or lack any sense of taste but damn, this is pathetic. I wonder who the random waiter was that took our sauce while we were eating, right off of our table, and didn't even give it back or anything?? Strange. I laugh though, the place must be hurting. Finally, on top of other dishes that were subpar at best, WHILE in the midst of paying.. our same waitress comes up to us as we are in the process of putting our money out, to say, ""Hey, are you done paying?"" Not even a minute after we get the bill. So did we leave a tip? We sure did, here it is: Go fudge yourself. Plenty of other damn good Vietnamese places in Viet town, but this place isn't one. Such a shame, the place is in a great location and had potential, but perhaps to this particular waitress that looks as if maybe she needs to get bent, made it go downhill without hesitation.

I myself had a roast duck / pork rice plate and a fried fish ball app. The BBQ rice plate was a steal at $7!!! Hopefully the owners won't see my review and raise the prices :p Roasted pork had crispy skins, which I don't take for granted after many bad prior experiences.  Duck was fine, nothing special to me, solid taste but not better than other places I have gone to.  The pork was one of the best I have had in my opinion because of the perfect crispy skin, even though I only had a few small pieces, I savored every bite!  I was also relying on the veggies that come with the rice plate to meet my veggie quota, but that was almost non-existent, so I recommend ordering a side veggie if you do want to eat some greens. As for the fish ball, it was an disappointment.  At $9.50, this was not cheap.  Portion looked huge, but that's because they added a thick coating before they fried the fishball.  I have never in my life had fried fish ball with such thick coating!!!  Without the coating, upon frying, the fish cake will expand and the fishball will temporarily become inflated and also gives a nice feel to the outside skin.  in order to eat the rendition here at sun wah, I had to painstakingly remove all the coating, and eat the remaining fish ball that's half the size and more like fishball in soup without the fry factor.  Tragic.

I have also had their Peking Duck and thought it was good (though I make better Peking Duck at home). Tonight we decided to order some of their non-BBQ items. What a mistake! With one exception, it was dreadful. This is what we ordered:     1. Chicken congee. Congee is a simple dish: rice is cooked with stock until every grain of rice swells and becomes ten times its size. It is usually rich and delicious. This stuff tasted as if it had been cooked with plain water. There were a few pieces of dry chicken. I tried to zap it up by adding chicken stock, fried onion, coriander, chopped green onions and soy sauce. Didn't help. Still bland, with an unpleasant under-taste.     2. Roast duck strips with chow fun noodles. I should have asked more questions about this one. I thought it would be a simple dish of roast duck strips and pan-fried chow fun noodles. Instead, it was mostly vegetables. some duck, and on the bottom, bland chow fun noodles that didn't look as if they'd ever seen a saute pan. They had a waxy taste. The sauce was so bad, I can't even describe it. I took one bite, spat it out and said, ""This is vile."" My husband agreed.    3. Spareribs in Black Bean Sauce. Usually a favorite of my husband's no matter where he orders it. This version had a thick brown gravy with none of the rich, fermented tang of black beans. He couldn't eat it.    4. Steamed Fresh Chilean Sea Bass. The fish looked more like snake! A thick skin, to which clung a layer of yellowed flesh. It seemed to have been dried, then frozen, then reconstituted, then dried again and cooked in broth. It tasted anything but fresh, My husband loves fish and is pretty tolerant if something has a strongly ""fishy"" taste, so that wasn't the problem. It was just unpleasant. He didn't want to be in the same room with it, where he could smell it, and asked me to take it to the kitchen and toss it.    5. Potstickers. The only halfway decent thing we ordered (though filled with chicken, not the traditional pork). Not good enough to redeem the rest of the food, by any means. We ate a few potstickers, then tossed everything in the trash - no exaggeration. The weird thing is that I believe one of the sisters who owns Sun Wah is a culinary school graduate.

2015-08-30,2.0,"I've always loved Sun Wah's barbecue pork. Way back when, I used to stop here for a pound and cook a variety of dishes the rest of the week, each made scrumptious by it. Five stars for the pork. Not so much for my soup today, or my experience in the restaurant. I've always loved wonton soup, especially during the time I lived in San Francisco. I would often go to lunch late, and a group of 4 - 6 of the restaurant staff would sit at one of the tables in the dining room, each wrapping wontons with a big bowl of ground pork and shrimp between them. The wontons were delicious, bathed in a broth built-up from a meld of delicious flavors. Whatever meat was on top added to the flavor. Sun Wah's soup was the opposite. Delectable BBQ pork, but with a broth that was as listless as... well... someone meandering through a grocery store, not remembering what to buy. Only when I added some of the hot sauce on the table (soy sauce with serrano peppers?) did the dish come alive, like turning watery broth into... watery broth with spicy soy sauce. The wontons were much more flavorful, with just a hint of spice inside. The menu picture showed a decent amount of greens. There were a few, and they were good, but the dish would have benefited from more. The service was blasé from when the moment I walked in until the moment I left. Even worse, I saw a server asking a diner for her order, when she clearly had her nose deep in the menu. That's a big (Great Dane-sized) pet peeve of mine, like when you're just inside a door for takeaway, and they immediately say, ""May I help you?"" ""Actually, let me help YOU understand what it looks like when a brother has just started looking at a menu. It looks like I do, right now."" Also, on the service side, no credit cards for bills less than $14. Really? In 2015? There was one thing that added a much hoped-for personality to the place. A few of the staff had gotten some treats from Superdawg for their own lunch. Note to self: a Superdawg made with Sun Wah's BBQ pork. I'm sure that Hot Doug would bless that idea. Until then, I'll have to come back with friends some evening to try the Peking Duck that Yelpster seems to be raving about.",0.9943,0.836,0.144,0.02,0.47975056689342394

More than any of the places in Chinatown, even, I recommend this as the best Chinese in Chicago. It's so good that even for people coming from out of town, visiting from abroad or anywhere else in the US, I recommend this. It belongs on the list of off-the-beaten-path things that you really should make time for if you're in the city. And here's why you should come here: the duck. Call ahead and make a reservation for a duck. This is the first step. Yes, you need a reservation. A single duck feeds three people (which is a STEAL at around $40/duck!), so if you have four or five people you can get an additional dish or two and share all of it (All the other stuff on the menu is good too; pick what you want, and you'll probably pick right). They will bring the duck out to your table, then proceed to make a show of carving it in front of you. These guys are masterful. It is incredible. I've had so many delicious ducks, and every time I watch them cut it up at the table and it's equally great. It's not just about the show, either -- this duck is perfect. It's crispy fried on the outside, there's a delicious sauce, and the duck itself is fatty and flavorful. Then, they will bring you little bao and vegetables and sauces, and you can make your duck pieces into little sandwiches. This may seem sacrilegious to the plate of pure, wonderful meat sitting in front of you, but it's not -- make the little sandwiches. They're incredible. The show is just starting, because now you will be brought fried rice and broth soup from the carcass of the duck you have just seen cleaned before your very eyes.

As you're stuffing yourself silly, you'll also receive duck-flecked fried rice, as delicious as ever, and duck soup that makes use of the bones.

2015-04-01,4.0,"So I found this place after doing a search for the best Peking/Beijing duck in Chicago - this was a dish I had never tried and I figured it was about time to rectify that. My yelp search revealed that this place had some very divisive reviews (including concerns about being shut down for health code violations) but I figured that it was worth giving it a shot, and I'm very glad that I did.  I made a Saturday dinner reservation a few days in advance and also told them I would be ordering the Beijing duck (as requested by the restaurant website). Once my date and I arrived, the restaurant was very busy, mainly with larger groups, but we were seated immediately and served hot tea.  The restaurant is bright and open, but without a lot of character - a bit more banquet hall than fine dining. Also, be prepared for birthday parties - the kitchen staff came out and rang a gong behind me unexpectedly. Before I figured out what was happening I though that Pinhead from Hellraiser was about to emerge.  Luckily the only thing to emerge was our duck, which was carved tableside. The duck meat, which was fantastic, was served with pancakes and vegetables, allowing us to make duck tacos of a sort. The remaining carcass was taken back to the kitchen and made into a duck broth and a fried rice dish, which came out shortly thereafter. All of the food was fantastic, and it was way too much for two people. Not a problem, since all of it besides the broth could go home and be easily reheated, but I would not hesitate to go back in the future as a group of four and order the same thing.  The bill for such a unique experience was very affordable - the entire duck dinner was $40 for the table, and we brought our own wine, which added a $10 corkage fee (still a bargain when drinking something from Trader Joes, when wine from the menu starts at $30).  I would certainly come back in the future to Sun Wah - nothing about the restaurant raised a red flag on the cleanliness front, and the somewhat anonymous ambiance was more than made up for by the price and the quality of the food.

An inspector for the Chicago Department of Health showed up at the Uptown restaurant at 5039 N. Broadway Monday after receiving a complaint from a customer who reported seeing a rat in the restaurant near the bar, city records show. The inspector found approximately 250 rat droppings on top of food containers and storage racks as well as ""gnaw marks"" in various bags of rice, dried fish and bulk food items, the report said.  The Chinese restaurant has a history of health code violations. It has failed health inspections at least eight times since November of 2010, according to city data.  When an inspector shuttered the restaurant after finding 10 live roaches on the floor of the restaurant in 2013, among other health violations, the restaurant's co-owner, Kelly Cheng, told DNAinfo Chicago that they ""just weren't vigilant enough."" Reached Tuesday, Cheng declined to elaborate on the latest inspection at her restaurant, which is known for serving up whole Peking duck that employees carve table-side.  In addition to rat droppings, the inspector Monday also found 10 or more mice droppings everywhere from under a fish tank to inside the women's bathroom on the first floor. The report said food was not protected from contamination, and an inspector witnessed employees cleaning dirty floors with cleaning product that splashed directly on partially cooked whole pigs, which were hanging from the ceiling about 3-4 inches from the floor. Also found at the restaurant were open containers of cooked food on the floor of the walk-in cooler and potentially hazardous food kept at improper temperatures, according to the city. The city has cited the restaurant for the latter violation multiple times, according to city data. Failing to keep foods at proper temperatures increases the risk of foodborne illness caused by bacteria that multiply in improperly stored food, health officials say. There was also no hot water in the sinks of the men's and women's bathrooms, the city said, and sinks in the kitchen need to be repaired. It's unclear when the restaurant will be back in business.

Three course dinner. it's pretty much good for 3 people @ around $15 per person.  1) You start with some dude coming by with a plastic wheely tray, a huge butcher's knife, and a crispy duck. He moves his hands and the knife and suddenly, you are left with slightly thin slightly thick, perfect cuts of steamy, warm, moist, juicy duck on a plate. They also do you a favor and leave you the duck butt. Hilarious. While the dude cuts the duck, waiters/resses bring you delicious, fluffy, bao buns... There is an upcharge to order more... Please add green onions, carrots, and delicious delicious duck sauce (hoisin and whatnot). 2) They take the duck to the back. Who knows if the rest fo the course is made with the same duck but who cares. Duck FRIED RICE. They use the rest of the carcass meat and make you delicious, oily, fatty, MSG fried rice. It's great. I learned most recently that you can ask for noodles instead... I've never gone back to rice.  3) Duck soup. The least favorite part of this 3-course dinner... but nonetheless the perfect end to a greasy, oil, duck-filled meal. It has a bit of bitter melon in it and tries to end your night on a bright, clean palette..

Once we got a table, we ordered the BBQ combination, Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, and rice. And I got the ginger mojito. The BBQ and broccoli arrived and tasted good, but it was merely lukewarm. No rice. When I finally saw our server and told her about our missing rice, she was very apologetic and said she'd get it. Well, she eventually came with the bill, but the rice never showed. She apologized again, saying she asked another woman to bring it. It didn't ruin the dinner, and the server took it off the bill, which I appreciated. And I get that this place gets very busy, and I am impressed with how quickly and efficiently they seat people.

Oh...kay...  The menu is fairly expansive, so we took a little time to make a decision, and apparently during this time completely eroded her already anemic store of patience, because every other interaction we had with her was curt and unfriendly.  (Before the cries of, ""It's a cultural thing!!!"" commence, our server had no accent, spoke flawless English, and was obviously brought up here.  Also, I have eaten at dozens of Chinese places in this city and this was the least-friendly service I may have ever had.) We also had to track her down (with difficulty) for things like refills on water, our check, etc.  This place has Godawful service. Bad news on the roast duck, guys.  It was (pardon the pun) bone dry, but somehow still greasy.  Also, the only flavor really present seemed to be five-spice.  It's all I smelled our entire meal.  No one was really happy with the duck.   As for the shrimp with pan fried egg noodles, it was in theory prepared correctly (tender shrimp, crispy and also soft noodles, crisp veggies), but unfortunately had no flavor whatsoever.  Have you ever taken a salt shaker to a plate of Chinese food?  Me neither, before now.  Also, it was $11 for a large plate, comparable to something that would be $8 or $9 at most other restaurants I've been to.  Not worth it. The saving grace here were the eggrolls, which are freaking amazing.  However, we ordered two orders and only received one, but it didn't seem worth it to track down our server so we just went with it.

2014-07-21,4.0,"Definitely the most solid Chinese food you can find in Chicago. The Peking duck is perfectly done, served with an amazingly flavourful broth and fried rice. This is pretty much the most authentic Peking duck you're going to find outside of China. Been here a number of times and never been disappointed by the duck. The other dishes are alright - enough to supplement the duck if you go with a group with particularly big appetites. That being said, the quality of the other dishes are about the same as average Chinese food in Chicago - unremarkable bordering on disappointing. I don't really blame the establishment though - they're mainly known for one thing, so I have NO idea why anyone would bother coming here if they're not going to order the duck. Considering how busy they are most nights, service has generally been speedy and efficient. I recommend ordering ahead of time if you're going with a big group, but if you're only ordering one duck, you can usually just walk in. The kid who cuts up the ducks (it's always been the same guy - that poor kid must have not had a vacation day in years) does a great job. It's an authentic Chinese restaurant though, so don't expect to be wooed by your server; I'm happy as long as they take my order, bring me food, and refill my tea.",0.9108,0.832,0.115,0.052,0.44666666666666666

They have a variety of other Chinese dishes and drinks, but virtually every table was here for the poultry.  My friend and I ordered the most deluxe version at around $40 total. It was a single roasted duck and the server sliced it at the table expertly. It also comes with a fun of the white buns. I prefer to make a mini bao/sandwich by putting the meat inside the bun and adding sauce and vegetables.  Anyways, the duck here is melt in your mouth good. The skin is perfectly crisp and the meat is tender and moist. It's not too oily and the flavor is spot-on. The portion is humongous, I couldn't even finish my half.

We were seated towards the back of the restaurant and it was impossible to get service, the entire back section of the restaurant was empty and no one bothered to look our way. One of our orders was also wrong, but we share the blame. I asked for pea leaves, which they have listed as pea tip and gave us snow peas instead.  But the main reason for the poor service review is that the Peking duck is supposed be carefully cut, as the crisp skin is one of the reasons the duck is so good. The slices of meat are supposed to be thin. On this trip the duck was hacked to pieces at our table. Poor service aside, the food is still very good.

After hearing about the popularity of this place (my friend told me he had to wait 3 hours for a seat once), I made a reservation a week in advance and also pre-ordered a duck (one duck is enough for a party of 4).  Upon entering, I was surprised to see how big the establishment was. The interior isn't particularly nice, but it's clean and far from bad. In addition to the duck (which, by the way, comes with the duck slices/pickled vegetables as well as soup and fried rice made with the leftover meat and bones), we also put in an order of chinese broccoli.  The duck itself was great - flavorful and juicy, and the buns were also soft and plushy. They barely gave us any pickled vegetables at the start, so we had to ask for more (which they do charge for, but not much). The soup itself is very clean tasting, which is a nice change from the rich flavors of the previous course. Finally, the fried rice isn't particularly special - probably the least unique/flavorful part of the 3 courses, but it was still good. Especially with the order of Chinese broccoli, there was MORE than enough food - we ate till bursting point and still had leftovers. I would even say we could have squeezed in one more person and still ate till we were at least satisfied. Definitely worth your money (I think our bill came to about $60-70). Service wasn't amazing but it was pretty efficient.  This place is also BYOB. I did not partake, but noticed the signs.

We noticed that he wasn't wearing gloves, as we approached him to ask him to put on gloves TWO COCKROACHES came out. One from under the pig the other from under the serving table. We freaked out and told the server, he saw one and HE KILLED THE ROACH WITH HIS BARE HANDS  AND THEN  CONTINUE CUTTING INTO THE PIG TOUCHING IT WITH THE HAND HE HAD JUST KILLED THE RAOCH WITH. We told him to take the pig away and that we didn't want it, but he didn't understand english only spoke spanish. He walk away leaving the pig there and then came back with gloves and continued to cut away. We looked for a manager and finally someone came and told him to take it away. The waitress told us that they would take the pig off our bill and would give us a 10% discount, what was shocking was that she was so relaxed about the whole thing, and was acting as if it wasn't a big deal almost as if they deal with this all the time.  Even more disappointing when we go the bill we got our measly 10% discount but they STILL charged us for the deposit on the suckling pig!

I'd like to think i've eaten a decent amount of chow fun, but Sun Wah totally shifts the paradigm; I have had plenty with ""wok hei"", the charred texture/scent that comes with freshly stir fried noodles. But the chow fun here has both wok hei and an added dimension of slightly crispy, almost crunchy, and yet soft noodles, along with tasty beef, spring onion, and sprouts. Here I was, thinking Hot Doug's, deep dish pizza, and Italian Beef were the pinnacle of Chicagoland food, and some random Chinese place that isn't even near Chinatown amazes the shit out of me.",0.9853,0.836,0.164,0.0,0.4093750000000001

The duck meal is a TON of food, even for my family with all the boys!  We only had 2 boys with us, (son #1 was away at college and son #2 had to work), and there were lots of leftovers.  We also had some peppered shrimp and I had some szchewan chicken.  We figured we could eek another meal out of leftovers and we could do that. Everything was tasty and they kept coming by to check on us.  They weren't that busy when we were there, so that was a good thing.  We had so much food they had to pull up an extra table next to us for all the dishes.   Now as far as the place, it reminded me of eating at a banquet hall. There were several empty tables, but they looked like they needed a good wipe down. It just looked like it needed some TLC.  Overall, it's nothing fancy and the sound probably carries a lot when it gets busy.  Maybe I'm getting picky as I get older, but I thought the bathroom was a little dodgy.  You know the difference between when you use those wipes to clean vs. when you get out of the cleaner and really scrub?  I felt like it could use a good scrubbing.  It didn't really affect my experience, but it is part of the package deal.

2014-03-07,4.0,"I have two major things to say about this place. First of all, the food is AMAZING. It was absolutely the best duck that I have ever had, and before this I was not a huge duck fan. We had a big party, around 16 people, and pre-ordered 4 ducks. We probably could have gone with 5, since everyone loved it. We also ordered the fried rice (excellent), the lo mein (also excellent), and bone marrow soup that I did not love but the rest of my table did (if you don't like bones in your soup, it's probably not for you either). However, though the service was excellent as well, I am only giving this place four stars because the restaurant itself was a little...bright. I felt more like I was eating in a food court than a restaurant. Also, they had our 16-person party separated in to two tables of 8, which was awkward. We eventually asked if we could move the two tables together, but then 4 people ended up eating awkwardly (myself included) in the ""cleavage"" of the tables, so essentially back-to-back with someone else. There were plenty of rectangular tables in the place, and it would have been nice if they had thought to put us in a long row instead of at two separate tables. Other than that, I highly recommend. It's BYOB, which is fantastic, but if you finish of your bottle of wine or your six pack and are still thirsty, they have beers on tap. How awesome!!",0.9853,0.792,0.153,0.055,0.7107971014492753

Chock-full of ingredients and great flavor  Mixed vegetables with tofu: the tofu blocks were a little chewy, but the sauce was good  Cashew chicken: Delicious take on this very American dish  We may have had one other dish -- TONS of food for the amount of people eating it.  They have a full bar, but also let you BYOB for a $5-per-bottle corkage fee, which we took advantage of, twice.

This restaurant seemed to have a very large caucasian clientele (usually a red flag for me when I go to Chinese restaurants), and I know these gelatinous rice balls are not always popular among those who did not grow up eating it - so maybe they were tired of throwing away uneaten gelatinous rice balls?

A person comes out with a whole duck on a cart and carves it in front of you at the table. They are really only giving you the crispy skin and a little meat in order to make little sandwiches. The meat of the duck really goes into the duck fried rice and the carcass remains to make duck bone soup. It is a really filling meal that can easily serve a table of four. The whole duck dinner will run you about $40. Beware: extra pancakes and veggies cost extra.

Shrimp Fried Rice:  Soo good!  Small chunks of shrimp throughout the rice.  It was super flavorful and packed with veggies.  Recommend!! Won Tons:  Filled with shrimp and pork.  Not too much filling.  More of the outer shell instead.  Not very good. Fried Shrimp:  Big shrimps, battered and fried.  Served with a sweet and sour sauce.   Chicken with broccoli:  A little soupy.  The broth was an oyster sauce type deal.  There were strips of chicken breast.  Lots of broccoli stems to fill the dish.  Flavor was ok.   Chicken Meat with Curry:  Good flavor.  Once again, a little soupy for my taste. I'm used to more of a reduction that sticks more to the meat but I can tell this is super authentic.  This dish also has sauteed onions.   There were other items that we got, however, I didn't have a chance to eat.  Overall, the place is good.  The flavor makes it authentic and definitely worth trying at least once.  It was super convenient.  I will check back with them on my next trip to get more of that fried rice!",0.9929,0.859,0.133,0.008,0.4508367128902844

We decided to order a shrimp appetizer that was dipped in egg yolk and topped with bacon, then pan seared.  Bacon and any seafood is winning combo in my opinion, and the egg, as strange as it may sound; only added to the flavor profile of the dish.  We then were served the meal we had come for, the Peking duck.  The server skillfully carves the bird tableside and prepares a platter of golden, aromatic duck.  It is served with fresh carrots and green onions as well as a deep red sweet and tangy sauce (which I would drink by itself).  You are also given a plate of bao bread to make little sandwiches.  The bread is a light pillowy fluff that is very different than any other bread I have tried.  The perfectly prepared duck with a little carrot and green onion...

We had made reservations a couple of days in advance requesting the Beijing Duck Feast which very much seems to be the draw and go-to for this restaurant. It really is great and lived up to the hype. We enjoyed watching them carve up the duck and the first course with the buns is just excellent. The fried rice and soup as others have mentioned are not the tastiest, but they are complimentary to the overall experience and with a little of the hot and spicy table side sauces, the fried rice got better. The duck was extremely juicy and the skin nice and crispy. The hoisin sauce that comes with it is possible the best hoisin sauce I have had and I love me some hoisin sauce. Draping it across the steamed bao was the perfect addition to the pickled daikon/carrots and raw carrot/green onions. Wrap it all up with the freshly carved duck and it was a party going down. I really liked the atmosphere and overall decor. It has a San Francisco China-town feel to it at the front with various carcasses hanging in front of the window. Once you walk in pass that area, it is a very open space with some exposed brick interior, high ceilings, part of which has large windows letting in a load of natural light. The broccoli in oyster sauce was just ok and it was our attempt at adding some vegetables to an otherwise near vegetable-less meal. I am not sure if it is customary for them to bring the tofu/ginger esque soup upon completion, but while we appreciated it, it was not to our liking even though I am a fan of ginger.

Affordable. Good for Groups. Amazing food. A ""duck dinner"" consists of one whole roasted duck (yum!) - sliced and served with some gua pao, duck soup, and duck fried rice. If you order two ducks, they'll give you noodles instead of another rice. They literally use the whole duck and you get your money's worth (~$40 for the whole thing).

Most of the other dishes we ordered were very good though and redeemed the restaurant. It seems Cantonese food is their forte, which we kind of thought it might be when we first looked at the menu and wondered how Peking duck was offered there.

It seems only the privileged gets to order the peking duck feast because it's not stated on the menu or posted up anywhere in the restaurant.  It's not like this is their best selling entree.  But just ask anyone that works there, they all know about the special.  We ordered: Eggplants Stuffed with Shrimp: this was surprisingly good.  You get a burst of flavor from the eggplant that's drenched in a black bean sauce while having that crunch from the fried shrimp in the middle.  The sauce is what makes this dish delicious. Peking Duck Feast:  - Sliced duck with steam buns, green onions, carrots, and hoisen sauce: they brought out a whole roasted duck and started slicing it in front of us.  I liked that we could see that we get the whole duck for our money.  For the most part, I thought this dish was just ok.  The duck was a little dry and kind of tasteless, but the skin was roasted to a nice crispness.  I had to add the onions, carrots, and hoisen sauce (which was watered down) to give it more flavor.      - Soup: didn't like this at all.  The tasteless duck didn't give this soup any type of flavor.  Add salt people!!  - Duck fried rice or noodle: omg this was the worst dish of the night.  It was dry, cold, and bland.  Enough said. I don't know if the cooks back there know what they are doing, but the whole ""feast"" lacked flavor.  I thought this place was known for their peking duck, but this was a huge disappointment.  Service here was not that great either.  The waiter hovered over us while we were looking at the menu and kept on asking us if we were ready to order.  It wasn't like they were busy, why were they trying to pressure us to order right away?  Also they charged for everything that is normally free like extra sauce and extra rice.  I don't see myself coming back up here again or would recommend anyone else to try this place.",0.9805,0.806,0.127,0.067,0.5511526832955405

We also ordered egg rolls, and they were huge.  They actually had meat inside of it as well, which is a major plus for me. I'll be back for the Duck soon!",0.9606,0.794,0.17,0.036,0.6576068376068377

2013-06-30,5.0,"Have you ever eaten a cloud? Have you ever licked a rainbow? That is the experience of eating at Sun Wah. There are plenty of ways to enjoy Sun Wah, but the open floor plan and huge round tables make this place ideally suited for celebrations with friends and family. BYOB or grab a shot of ginseng infused vodka from the bar, then sit down and order the duck. Yes, you have plenty of amazing menu options: the wheat noodles in the soups are chewy and satisfying and the Hong Kong style Lo Mien will blow your mind, but I'm betting that Peking Duck is probably the only food served in Heaven. And Sun Wah's Peking Duck is the best - and most authentic - I've ever had outside of Beijing. It's served with cloud-light steamed buns which you fill with duck, plum sauce, and a garnish of thinly sliced carrots, cucumbers, and scallions, to make a sandwich that should be considered a national treasure. As soon as I tasted the first medallion of crispy skin, I immediately sought out the manager. She obligingly showed me to the drying ducks, brick ovens, and after received my compliments with deference, coaxed me back to my seat in time for Duck Fried Rice and Duck Soup, which are made with the remnants of the carved bird. These dishes are included with your order of the duck and perfectly round out the feast. I must admit that every time I go to Sun Wah, I over order and end up bringing these dishes home. Is this an accident? Maybe... But what's better than leftover duck fried rice and duck soup for lunch? If you decide to try something other than the duck, you won't be disappointed. The other BBQ specialties are all fantastic, but menu includes some more familiar Chinese dishes such as Beef and Broccoli, Peking Style Spareribs, and Mo Po Tofu. The authentic, but perhaps less familiar, dishes are definitely worth exploring. For vegetarians, I strongly recommend trying the Eggplant Sautéed with Garlic (off menu) to experience the perfect interplay of texture between the rich garlic sauce and crisped strips of eggplant. Or try the Tofu with Straw Mushrooms for a flavor so earthy is seems to fill your whole mouth. For seafood lovers, the Blue Crabs with Black Bean Sauce is the sort of savory experience that makes your jaw ache with pleasure at first bite, and the Fish Fillet with Stir-Fried Ginger and Green Onion manages to deeply satisfy without leaving you feeling weighted down. You won't go wrong at Sun Wah. It is a restaurant that requires many visits and is best experienced with friends. The staff work extremely hard, but seem genuinely pleased to serve groups that have chosen to celebrate in their restaurant.",0.9988,0.753,0.218,0.029,0.5297705314009661

I ordered a week ahead two special dinners for 13 people who'd be eating them. Two of us ordered off of the menu. We also got an order of Chinese broccoli and one of bok choy. Two ducks with the sides were just enough; we had one bao and a scrap of duck left.  The staff was expert with the carving of the duck at our table--dinner and a show.

2013-06-13,5.0,"Terrific for large groups.  Make a reservation in advance and order the Peking  Duck Dinner and / or the Roast Pig Dinner depending upon how many guests there will be. The Duck Dinner includes the Roast Duck and one bun per person and one soup per person and one plum sauce per duck and one dipping sauce per person as well as a choice of Duck Fried Rice or Duck Noodles.  Be prepared to be charged for each additional bun and sauce that is ordered.   The Roast Pig includes the whole roast pig and some sauce, the pig skin fried and cut into pieces, and some additional items. Pescetarian, Vegan or Vegetarian guests can order from the menu after you get there. Be sure to order additional vegetable dishes to share. This is a nice place to go for a Sunday evening group celebration around 6-6:30 PM because the restaurant isn't overwhelmed with other parties. I highly recommend bringing your own box of wine to share to avoid multiple corkage charges. Street parking is available, but may require a search. We've been to Sun Wah twice:  once with a group of 11; once with a group of 12. Both times our service was excellent.  The duck and pig were ready for our group when we all arrived and service began shortly after we were seated.  The additional vegetable sides, and the additional seafood entree arrived at our table when ready.  The flow of the meal was excellent, the water goblets were refilled regularly and used plates cleared as necessary.

2013-06-03,2.0,"Went there after the restaurant was highly recommended by other friends. I live closer to Chinatown so BBQ King House is where I usually go to satisfy my roast duck cravings! I went on a Sunday evening around 7.30pm and the place was crowded, had to wait 5-10 minutes for a table. Once we were seated, we were served by Lily who didn't speak much English. I ordered the Soy Chicken and Roast duck combination ove rice while my friend ordered the Chicken Fried Rice. Turns out Lily messed up my friend's order by bringing Roast Duck over rice instead of the Chicken Fried Rice. I started to eat my food since it was getting cold but I was almost done with my meal before the Chicken Fried Rice showed up. We stopped Lily a few times - either she ignored us or when she did see us, she told us that the Kitchen is busy so we have to wait for the fried rice (are you kidding me??? Kitchen is busy during dinner, isn't that supposed to be good? What's the point of going to dinner if you can't eat a meal together??). Anyway, we spent more time than we intended over dinner  because of the mess up and the servers didn't even care. Brought us our check and sent us on our way. Overall, the food was good, though I prefer BBQ King House (and they are so accomodating when I make slight changes to my order like extra green onion sauce or no soup, etc) - due to the despicable service, I would probably not go back to Sun Wah unless it is was with a much bigger group and we were doing the Duck Feast meal.....",0.6132,0.873,0.072,0.055,0.4232666666666667
2013-06-01,4.0,"This review is being written under the influence of Casillero del Diablo - Cabernet Sauvignon de Chile, which was a perfect compliment to the tender, savory Beijing Duck Dinner we had at Sun Wah BBQ. Upon entering the restaurant, we were first overwhelmed with the size of what seemed to be a little hole-in-the-wall from the outside. After taking in the smells and sights of the open kitchen near the entrance we were seated quite promptly. (Even though we arrived almost 25 minutes before our reservation).  If it's raining, be careful! The floors are slick! The Beijing Duck Dinner is a prix fixe menu. Unfortunately, the duck comes out first. The technique and skill of our table-side carver was mesmerizing. Before we could have another sip of wine we had a plate of duck, a dish of hoisin sauce, and some garnishes. A few minutes later the server returned with a plate of bao, some fried rice and a big bowl of soup. The bao made an excellent vehicle for the hoisin (or any of the other sauces on the table) as well as the duck. The fried rice, while delicious, was a little under seasoned for my tastes. While I was reaching for the salt, my boyfriend, Brian,  was reaching for the Sriracha.  The soup, in and of itself, was quite tasty. It had nice body and was aromatic, but after the rich duck and fried rice, tasted akin to nothing. This meal would easily feed four people with a moderate appetite, three hungry people, or two boyfreeends. (We ate everything but the soup).  The dessert was some sort of sweet gelatinous substance with candied ginger. Brian's had the perfect amount of ginger. Mine had way too much.  The service was fast, friendly, and overall a good experience. Would be happy to come back and order the same.",0.992,0.848,0.147,0.005,0.5295454545454544
2013-05-28,4.0,"As a South California Asian that landed in the suburbs of IL, one of the first things that crossed my mind was where I would find some good chinese BBQ. What can I say? I love my fatty roast pork and duck. So when I heard of Sun Wah BBQ, I nearly crapped my pants. Too bad it took me TWO YEARS to finally try the place. This joint is HUGE, un-suffocating (I'm making up words to here), and almost industrial. Very atypical if we were to compare to the normal chinese BBQ place. I don't feel as anxious or rushed at SWBBQ and appreciate the setup. There are these ginger mojitos that are absolutely fantastic. The bartender was generous so these babies packed a punch to them. Fresh ingredients contributed to a nice refreshing taste. SWBBQ has some super fat egg rolls. Substantially stuffed with pork (if I remember correctly) and cabbage, they are pretty darn good. They also have this bacon wrapped shrimp that wasn't anything mind boggling and taste just as you'd imagine if you read at a elementary school level. Hell, with all the techy IPADs, tutoring centers and ADHD meds out these days, I'd dare say kindergarden level. You can order a roasted duck meal were they carve out a whole duck in front of you and serve it with the fluffy buns, green onions, carrots, and this really good dark sauce. After, you get a soup and duck fried rice. Parties of 4 or more I'd recommend going HAM and getting two orders. Roast pork roast pork roast pork. Whether it be from the cholesterol or the flavor, I part of me dies every time I eat this. But honestly, its a price I'd gladly pay...until I reach about 35.

2013-05-27,2.0,"The service was absolutely terrible, but the food was great.  We preordered our ducks (two) for 6pm today (memorial day) and arrived about 5 minutes earlier. We were swiftly seated and I was so excited to eat because I've heard great things about the place. However, about 5 minutes after we were seated, we were told that they don't have any ducks ready and that we would have to wait 30 minutes for our ducks. We told them that we preordered but the waitress named Lily was obviously stressed out and was being very attitude-y and rude to us. Basically, we waited 35 minutes and still no food came out. Nothing. We called our waitress again (who NEVER came to our table to update us on our food) and she said that we have to wait another 25 minutes. This is when we started getting very annoyed. We already waited 35 minutes for the food we PREORDERED and still 25 minutes more? We complained about the wait to our waitress and she basically said ""it's not our problem"". No apology, just a ""everyone else is waiting too"".  We asked the waitress if we could talk to the manager but she murmured something and went away. We realized she never went to get the manager so we asked another waitress who was very nice to get her, and the manager came straight away.  We complained to the manager about how it is unacceptable to have to wait an hour or more for the food we preordered, and she also said that there wasn't anything she could do about it. She literally said ""if you want to leave we can cancel your order"". Oh, and no complementary anything. She said ""no, there will not be anything complementary"" Then I asked ""so there was no point in preordering the food. Why couldn't you have told us we would be waiting for an hour?"" and she basically said ""it's impossible to estimate wait time"". No, it is clearly possible but the disorganized process in the restaurant was the problem.  Oh, and she also mentioned that there was only one person working in the back or something and one waitress for the entire back of the restaurant. On a holiday? They should be ready for all the families that would be eating out. I actually saw a customer getting into an argument with another waitress in front of the restaurant and the man ended up leaving the place looking very angry. Terrible service.  Food.  When the food came an hour later, honestly, we were all so hungry, anything would have been very good. But the duck which was cut right in front of us was delicious, moist and perfectly cooked. It later came with the soup, fried rice and noodles that were made with the leftover meat and bones from the duck. The buns were quite heavenly. Oh, on the subject of the buns, we ordered another tray if buns but it never came so we had to ask twice. Another negative on their service.  Overall, I would come back ONLY for the food because the service was terrible. All restaurants should know that we are paying for the food and service so we should not be met with delayed food and rude waitresses and manager.",-0.5333,0.773,0.109,0.118,0.5806011904761904

I love me some Sun Wah! There are some principal things to know about Sun Wah. 1) this is a duck place. Fans come here primarily for duck.  2) not all duck are equal. sidestep BBQ duck or BBQ anything (BBQ pork is bad). 3) ORDER Pei Par Duck & Peking Duck. you will become addicted. Note that Americans will like both, but likely the Pei Par even more. It's a silghtly fattier and more ""American BBQ-y"" flavor (not in BBQ paste/taste, but in richness). The Peking is also awesome (my personal fave), but less fatty tasting. It's a bit more ""natural"" tasting, a little bit earthier, more duck-y. 4) read my TOP note. I compare WITHIN the city. I've read some other reviews noting how their duck isn't special, but for Chicago IT IS! Compared to Washington DC, the duck is above avg, by no means terrible at all. BUT I'm not comparing to DC, I'm comparing to Chicago. That being said, what else is there to say? Looks like a typical Asian joint. It's an ok area, not great not bad. This place is also CHEAP. You can get Pei Par Duck or Peking Duck over rice for $6-9. Super cheap. You can get a whole duck for like maybe $25-35 (can't remember), and it can feed like 6.  A lot of people come with friends to enjoy a whole duck. I always order an extra side of Peking and Pei Par to go ^.^ It's not close to where I live, and I always crave some a few hours later. NOTE- this place is very, very popular, and it is NOT unusual to wait FOREVER for seats around 6-8.  It's a good idea to get reservations, OR avoid these hours (what I usually do).

2013-04-28,5.0,"""If I were on death row, this would be my last meal request before execution."" These are the morbid words my fiance uttered a few bites into the Beijing Duck Feast during our first visit to Sun Wah. At the end of the meal, I had to agree with him. The two of us devoured the entire feast (duck soup, duck fried rice, duck wrapped in bao, the remaining duck meat, tofu pudding dessert) and ordered some BBQ to go. I have to note that the portions are generous, we are overeaters and were starving at the time so I think the feast can easily satisfy 3 or 4 normal appetites. The duck skin was perfectly crisp, the meat succulently juicy, and there was just enough fat to make every bite savory but not greasy. The baos were light, pillowy, and slightly sweet. I've had richer duck soup but this soup was the perfect accompaniment to the rich meal, light but still flavorful with tender wintermelon, fragrant cilantro, and duck egg. Refreshing tofu pudding with sweet fresh ginger topped off the delicious meal. On top of the amazing food, our waiter was friendly and attentive. We also really enjoyed the upbeat but relaxing atmosphere. The bar, exposed brick, and high ceilings gave the place a lively urban vibe. On the other hand, the round banquet tables and open kitchen out front with hanging meats reflected the authenticity matched by the food. Being a Peking Duck fanatic and new to Chicago, I researched extensively for the best Peking Duck in town and naturally Sun Wah came up in every search. Because Sun Wah is a bit out of the way, I tried a few spots in Chinatown first but was always left wanting more.

2013-04-22,5.0,"Duck feast: you have been conquered. After months of hearing how great the duck feast is at Sun Wah BBQ, a few of my friends and I decided that we needed to experience the greatness. We made a reservation for 6:30pm for a party of four on a Friday and I was eagerly counting down the days until we could partake in the duck feast. Upon walking into Sun Wah, it has a very cafeteria-esque seating arrangement which is a bit odd. Regardless, we were promptly greeted by the host and hostess and shown to our table, after walking by numerous hanging ducks and suckling pigs. This may be a bit... scarring for some, but it just got me all the more excited for what the evening had in store for us. When our entire party was seated, we put in our drink order for the evening. Sun Wah provides a limited drink menu (mostly Goose Island drafts and ginger-based alcoholic beverages) but they are also BYOB. We noticed that many of the other patrons around us had brought their own wine and hard alcohol, so I'd recommend doing this in lieu of ordering from the restaurant. Mixed drinks were steeply priced around $10, and the draught beers were standard at about $5-$6. After our drinks were delivered, we placed our order. The waitress recommended getting extra bao buns as well as a side or appetizer. We were definitely up-sold on the side/appetizer recommendation as we had more than enough food for our party of four with the duck feast alone. Although, that being said, I'd definitely agree with the waitress in getting the extra bao buns. About ten minutes or so after we placed our order, the duck carving station parked itself at our table and the duck was expertly carved in front of us. Pieces of juicy meat and crispy skin were artfully placed in a platter, as we all drooled over the enticing aroma. We quickly assembled our baos with duck meat, topping it with the sauce (plum?) and the fresh and pickled veggie assortment. I don't want to beat a dead horse here, but the meat was both crispy and juicy, providing a delicious balance of flavors and textures. This is undoubtedly the best duck I've had in my life, and everyone at the table agreed.  After we put a healthy dent in the duck, the duck fried rice and soup arrived next. The duck fried rice was good, but it paled in comparison to the baos and freshly carved duck. The soup was definitely the loser of the evening. The broth wasn't seasoned and tasted watery, and the duck in the soup was the remains of the poorly chopped up carcass, meaning it was bony and difficult to eat. Lastly, our appetizer of eggplant stuffed with shrimp and Chinese broccoli arrived, making it seem a bit out of pace with the rest of the meal. The eggplant was a bit soggy and mushy, and lacked in flavor as well. We were all incredibly stuffed at this point, so the idea of anything besides duck seemed offensive. The Chinese broccoli was decent, it was properly cooked but it had a bit too much oil for my liking. All in all, the entire bill came to around $100, which wasn't bad for our party of four. You could definitely keep the cost down by sticking strictly to the duck feat and partaking in the BYOB policy. The staff and hosts were very friendly, and I definitely see myself coming back here when I'm craving an amazing duck feast!",0.997,0.814,0.145,0.041,0.42994908655286007

Whole Baby Pig - Yes, I have been here on a couple of occasions where we've pre-ordered a whole baby pig.  They need about 72-96 hours advance notice.  Bring about 10 or more people and you have a really cheap meal.  The pig is always cooked nicely.  The skin is crispy and the meat is always moist and tender.  This is a great solution for my lechon cravings!

2013-04-02,5.0,"I certainly didn't originally come to Chicago with the intent on eating Chinese, particularly since NY has a pretty extensive Chinatown. That said, it's very difficult to find Peking duck that is prepared in the same wholesome manner as it's done in the homeland - so when my fiancee saw that you can order the entire duck, getting lunch was a priority. If you are interested in the duck, do call ahead the day before just in case, as they do end up roasting the duck for a long time before it gets carved up. The space itself is just a couple blocks over from the Argyle L stop, and it's a very spacious restaurant that had plenty of free seating on a Saturday afternoon. It's definitely nicer than most of the grungy spots that I've usually encountered in Chinatowns in other cities. Service is pretty standard, although I will say that you do have a good selection of Goose Island here - quite the upgrade over Tsingtao. The duck itself is prepared right in front of you on a cart, with the usually accoutrements - sliced carrots and celery, hoisin sauce, and buns - served with it. The meat is as juicy and smoky as Peking duck should be - it is so delicious and tastes just like it did in Beijing, albeit with less things you can put on it. You are also served a gigantic plate of duck fried rice (which I think is made with different duck) and a bowl of duck soup. The fried rice is what made me stuffed, but it was overall pretty solid, if standard. I actually liked the duck soup a lot here; it didn't have the heaviness that most duck soups I had in China were like. It's very refreshing when you're taking a break from making yourself tasty duck rolls. Perhaps the best thing is that the shebang (duck, fried rice, and soup) comes out to a little over $30, which is not a bad price at all - and, if I remember correctly, pretty comparative to what it costs to get a similar meal in China. The duck is phenomenal, though, and by far the best I've had in the U.S. anywhere. If duck isn't your thing, there's a very extensive menu that serves numerous other Chinese dishes...but if you are coming here, getting the Peking duck (not the roast duck) is pretty much required. Make sure to bring a friend or two, though, as this is not a small meal that one person can handle on their own.",0.9959,0.838,0.151,0.011,0.5159054097829607

The new location is simply amazing.   The owners must have scraped together decades of profits to pay for the remodel of the industrial space.   They clearly raised the roof and added a skylight which bathes the huge dining room in natural light. Another ancillary benefit of the new location is that there is ample parking on this stretch of Broadway as it is sufficiently far enough away from the melange of storefronts on Argyle. But you don't come here for the atmosphere (or at least I don't).  You come for the food.   The amazing food.   The owners clearly haven't forgotten what brought them to this amazing location and continue to put out top-notch food. Duck.   Make sure you get the Peking duck.  Most restaurants require 24-hour notice so they can prepare the duck (it takes that long).  Sun Wah sells so many of these that they make them every day knowing full well that they will most likely sell out of them the next day. The duck is not just a dish, it's an experience.  Someone brings the whole duck to your table (so you know you're getting a full duck) and proceeds to skillfully slice it up and present it on a serving tray to you.   The duck comes with duck sauce, scallions, carrots, and bao (little doughy buns) with which to make your own little duck tacos.   The skin is super crispy and the flesh savory without crossing over into the realm of salty.  Perfect.   Also, you get a large bowl of broth made from the carcasses of previously butchered birds as your carcass is taken away to the kitchen for further use in the broth.",0.993,0.853,0.143,0.004,0.5475064231161793

We ordered our food and here is where the primary issues come in.  When my date ordered a drink and asked for a slice of lemon with it, the waiter didn't know if they or the bar had lemon.  No biggie, when he said he'd check with the bar but there may be a charge it seemed kind of odd.  Seriously?  Charge for a drink garnish?   Now's where the fun begins after you order everything.  It's a crap shoot as to what comes out when.  I ordered a soup and the BBQ combo over rice, he ordered a similar BBQ dish and a small fried chicken.  Surprisingly on this visit both entrees came out together (very quickly I might add).  However the soup, which I consider more an appetizer, did not come out.  After several minutes the soup came out, and then the small fried chicken.  The 'small' soup is large enough to serve 4, but no small bowls provided.  A few minutes after everything was out the waiter bought some smaller bowls and soup spoons! I have to laugh because it's so inconsistent.  I've been here once before and had the same experience with the randomness of food arriving.  I half expect if I ordered dessert I'd have that before the entrees. The last thing, which was definitely a minor issue was when we split the bill.  One of us was paying cash and the other on credit card.  When we handed the waiter the money we asked the waiter to put the difference on the card.  He responded that he couldn't because the credit card minimum was $14.  Where did $14 come from seemed kind of random?  We took the cash back and had it all placed on the card.   It kind of felt like a restaurant you go to for bad service in a way, but I know that's not the case.  If you don't mind the little minor inconsistencies I mentioned (which I don't) and want some phenomenal, reasonably priced food in good sized portions check it out.  If you're someone who wants to eat your appetizers first then you might want to go somewhere else.  Regardless check it out you can always get the takeout.",0.9276,0.887,0.064,0.049,0.4097751322751323

Granted I don't eat roast duck that often but the point is that the duck here is really good. The combo that involves an entire roast duck, Peking style (but including the meaty chunks that true Peking duck dishes often leave off) + duck soup + duck fried rice + dessert is quite the deal.  The roast duck was cooked to perfection with the crispy skin and meat that was soft, chewy, and tender. The buns, scallions, and other usual Peking duck condiments were of great quality and put together, the flavor was really something else.  The soup was a great flavorful but simple blend of duck, wintermelon, ginger, and salt. Probably a couple other ingredients in there that I can't remember right now but certainly no slouch when held up next to the roast duck itself. I am a little partial to soup though and love a good one to go with my meal.  The fried rice was fairly ordinary and like most other fried rice at Chinese restaurants. A little too greasy for my tastes but certainly the filling starch that's needed.  I'm not a huge dessert person so I let my buddies eat the dessert. We also ordered a plate of roast pork and while tasty, it was a little too salty. A plate of solid greens rounded out our dinner. Service was quick once we were seated, which is the real (non)issue with the restaurant. It's hugely popular and even with a rather large seating area, we had to wait a good 45 minutes on a Saturday night.

2013-01-15,4.0,"It was the night before Christmas, 2011, and I was looking forward to my first visit to Sun Wah with a bunch of friends the next day. I took out the trash to the dumpster in the alley, as is the tradition of various cultures on Christmas Eve. I decided to take the patio stairs back up to my apartment and when I was half way up the first flight of stairs I almost stepped on something sitting on the stairs. It was covered in fur. Not the dark fur of many local sewer rats, but the light fur of a small dog, it's hair tied in a ribbon. My reaction was pretty common: ""What the f****?""   I didn't know what to do, so I picked up the dog and took it to my apartment. Keep in mind I had just adopted my dog Billie, who was still a puppy, albeit twice the size of the little dog. And the little dog was so mean to Billie, I had to keep them separate. Who would leave their bratty dog outside? Is she even local? Or he? I didn't even bother turning him/her over to check for genitalia. That's just creepy.  I went through my building and knocked on doors. One door emanated the sound of drunk people partying. I knocked. Nothing. I knocked harder. Nothing. I kicked the door and finally some drunk woman answered. ""Can I help you?"" ""Are you missing a small dog?"" ""Uhhh. HOLY S**** is she small and blonde?"" ""Indeed she is."" So I brought the dog down to the party apartment and the girl was so happy and relieved, although I'm sure the relief was fake, seeing as she didn't even realize her dog was missing.  I went back up to my apartment feeling good that I just saved the day. I sat down to watch some Christmas Story when there was a knock on my door. It was the chick from downstairs bearing a gift. A bottle of wine. And what was on the label of the wine? A duck. Mallard. It must be an omen.  I brought the duck wine to Sun Wah the next day, seeing as they're BYOB and it was gone before I could even drink any of it. That was my miraculous Christmas story. The end.

2012-10-03,1.0,"I had such high hopes for this restaurant as it's ""off the menu"" Peking Duck has been widely talked about in the tourist mags. What I got was $37 duck that was mildly flavored and had soggy skin. It came with a large bowl of duck fried rice (But you wouldn't know it was duck by the taste of it) and duck soup (the one shining spot in this otherwise dim meal). They also gave a tiny side of julianned scallions and carrots. Seriously carrots? I've eaten Peking Duck across the USA and in Beijing, China and never have I been given carrots. When I asked for more scallions I was told it would be $1 extra. $1 for about 5 tiny slices of scallions?? All of that is a minor complaint though, compared to the soggy skin and flavorless meat. Peking Duck by definition should have sizzling crispy skin. When I asked the waiter why the most popular item on the menu is not on the menu he gave a strange questioning answer that maybe it was created after the menu was printed. When I asked another waitress why, she said it was because duck has a fluctuating price and they don't want to put it on the menu because it is constantly changing. I call B.S. It's not on the menu because it's a gimmick. People (like me) will be intrigued by this ""off menu"" meal and order it. Somehow it gives the illusion that it's more authentic. Sadly, since there's not many Peking Duck restaurants in Chicago, the locals and the gringos won't know the difference. They'll think it's the best duck they ever had. And they will be completely snowed. Speaking of snow, the staff is also completely un-personable and pretty much adhere to the view that the customer is always wrong. I will not be going back here the next time I am in Chicago. Save your money and head to Chinatown for something more authentic.",0.8315,0.899,0.058,0.043,0.47156682027649777

2012-09-29,2.0,"I'm in a prisoners dilemma with this restaurant..  Its in my best interest to come back to this restaurant and its in their best interest for me to come back, but will I do it?  My addiction to their duck will have to overcome my hatred for their management and their service in order to do so.   First off, I have had 3 very enjoyable experiences here.  Their duck is addictive.........I need it once every two months, and if a visitor  comes from out of town, their duck is a must and Greenmill is the ultimate follow up. However, heres the problem.  I go there tonight with my wife and a friend of hers whos in town all the way from Korea  We sit down at 8:50, the duck comes out at 10:00.  Now, I don't mind waiting, I got my drinks, good company I'm fine.  However, when the duck finally comes out its COLD.  I mean, cold, like its been sitting out for a few hours.  Its not only the duck is cold, the rice is cold, the buns are cold, and the soup is cold as well. In this situation,  I do what any reasonable human would do and see what I can get what I paid for, a duck that is hot, and not still quacking. The manager comes to my table and rather that actually empathizing with me, becomes defensive, doesn't apologize, and starts arguing with me.  She tells me thats thats the best she can do.  Really, the best you can do is serve a duck thats been sitting on the counter for two hours?   I mean, WTF.  She's gotta know a bit more about the service business than this right?  She continues with this fight for 10 minutes before agreeing to knock only 10% off my bill, but never apologizes.  (she must think she's steve jobs during antenna gate) Anyway, heres my dilemma.  I know I shouldn't ever go to this restaurant again and frankly I don't want to.  But when they actually do serve a duck that is hot, its f*cking amazing.   I honestly don't know what to do here.  I feel like I'm stuck in an abusive relationship.    I",0.9488,0.754,0.142,0.104,0.6059149029982362

Came here for my birthday this year, had a blast. Party of 15 was handled as best as they could. We dined family style with a collection of rare beers that would have any beer nerd envious (love the BYOB factor). We sampled standard items like their Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Seafood Soup, Crab Rangoon. All decent, but nothing worth repeating on a revisit.  The stars of the show were their Hong Kong Style Pork, Walnut Shrimp, Chinese Broccoli, Eggplant, and who could forget their simply stunning Peiking Style Duck. The skin on the Pork snapped like glass, the broccoli was slightly salty and very tender, and spicy eggplant and garlic (whoooooooh it's good!!!).  The Peking Style Duck is simply a must. It's hard to find, you have to order it ahead, the presentation is awesome, and everything works incredibly well together. The crunchy vegetables, tender duck with it's slightly crispy skin, topped with rich hoisin, all sandwiched between their fluffy steamed buns. Don't forget about the great soup they hook you up with after your finished with the Duck.  Sun Wah has a lot to offer on their menu. The restaurant is huge so it can facilitate a party of any size. Just about everything on their menu is worth ordering, I recommend going with the items everyone raves about.

I have definitely seen hanging meat before but it just did something to me. I actually walked in/out several times. I stopped people to get feedback and the regulars had only good things to say about the food, especially the duck. I decided to get some ribs even after reading Johnny T's glowing review. I know I cheated myself but I felt I needed to play it safe. The ribs were very tender. There was nothing fancy or spectacular about them but they were seasoned just right. They are served with a small container of soy sauce instead of barbecue sauce. It worked though.

I'm sure that I'm doing myself a disservice by not having tried any of the other dishes here, but sometimes when you find something that works, you stick with it.  I was fortunate enough to find something that works right away - the Duck dinner. As part of an anniversary celebration, I had made reservations about a week prior -- and judging from the people milling about at the entrance, reservations are definitely encouraged -- and specially requested the duck, which must be ordered at least a day or two in advance.  With that I will echo concerns below that Sun Wah is a large, warehouse-type room that is neither particularly romantic nor suited for those who need to speak up on a regular basis. But back to the duck.  The sweet sweet duck. Before either of us had dented our glasses of wine (byob for a $5 corkage fee), the duck was wheeled over to our table and sliced before our eyes.  Crispy, juicy, and full of everything I had hoped.  It's served with a plate of bao, a delightful hoisin sauce, daikon, and carrot for freestyling duck goodness, or mini duck sandwiches.  Later, the rest of the duck was brought back in the form of duck fried rice and an underwhelming soup with wintermelon (whatever that is) and lemongrass.  Throwing some siracha in it makes it more interesting, but even so, when compared to the other two courses, it didn't stand up at all.  The bao/duck ratio was a bit tough to manage, and required another plate of bao, but it was still worth it. Service was quick and friendly, and the duck dinner was reasonably priced and delicious.  There is really very little more that I ask of a restaurant...",0.993,0.835,0.15,0.015,0.4794953194953195
2012-05-22,5.0,"This review is only for the duck dinner, because I've been here three times and that's all I've ever eaten.  My first two visits involved me ditching my family and hitting Sun Wah for Christmas dinner with my friends.  It was worth all the huff I endured from my mother.  This most recent time was for my one year dating anniversary.  What Sun Wah lacks in romantic atmosphere, it makes up for in deliciousness.  And BYOBness. Sun Wah takes reservations and if you want the duck, they're required - you have to order it a day in advance.  For Christmas we ordered one duck for every 3 people and that was about perfect.  For the two of us we were able to take home leftovers (that the boyfriend snagged...he's lucky he's cute.)  As far as ambiance goes at Sun Wah, there isn't much.  It's one giant room with tables and sound bounces everywhere.  Particularly when that sound is a shrieking child.  Of which there were several.  Each of the times I was there servers were quick and attentive, even when the restaurant was slammed.  They worked quickly to open wine bottles and take orders and the duck arrived at the table within minutes. The duck feast starts with your browned, crispy duck being wheeled over to the table on a cart and carved in front of you.  The duck slices are plated at your table and served with bao, hoisin sauce, daikon and garnish.  This is my favorite of the duck courses and I always polish off a truly embarrassing number of bao (Fortunately, you can ask the servers to bring more.  I always do, though there is a charge.)  The next two courses are duck soup (not my favorite - to me it's really watery and bland) and either duck fried rice or duck fried noodles.  The rice is the standard - if you want noodles you have to be sure to tell your server up front.  I've had both and of the two I prefer the rice, but they're both phenomenal.  All of that goodness comes to you at the super reasonable price of $37/duck.  The corkage fee is $5 per bottle for wine, but if you forget to BYOB, Sun Wah also has a full bar.  I really, really like Sun Wah's duck dinner, and I don't even normally like duck.  It's something you have to try at least once and seems like it would be a fun ""Chicago-y"" experience for out of town guests and hard to please parents.

We came here for my Grandpa's birthday on saturday with two tables reserved seated right next to the kitchen. The service was typical for a chinese restaurant, you pretty much had to tackle them for any service. No rice, no water, not enough plates, not clearing any of the finished plates, we stacked the plates to get space cleared on the table.... and even after making the job easier for them they still did not take the empty plates. Unfortunately, my Dad could not join us for dinner, so we waited in the line at the front of the restaurant to order the Roast Pork for him to go. We were very specific about getting just the ribs... of course that's the tastiest part of any pig and that is why they charge you more for it. We saw the butcher cut it and weigh it, but what happens behind the counter when he chops it, you really can't see. When we got home, very surprised to see there were no ribs in that box. The butcher replaced it with all bones and a few pieces of meat! Ok, I could give them the benefit of the doubt that maybe it was a mistake (although it's hard to mix up if you are only taking one order at a time). This has happened to us multiple times already!

The reservation was made (I am told a reservation is good practice if you plan on ordering the duck) for about 5 people. On arrival (Wednesday night), I realized that the place was mostly empty and questioned myself as to why I needed to reserve in the first place. In any case, we ordered the duck meal (there were 6 of us in fact) and supplemented with some additional sides (Roasted Pork, Garlic-fried green vegetables and an additional noodle dish). I'll focus on the duck meal -  Perhaps my expectations were set a little too high. Being from Toronto (Canada), I am proud to say that I think we have amazing Chinese food. The one thing about the duck meal that was perhaps my sticking point was the buns they used. I am used to the larger, thin and flat rice paper skins that are used to wrap the duck and condiments; so when I saw the buns used here, I was a bit sad. I found that with the thicker, smaller wrap, you couldn't get away with stuffing more duck in your wrap due to the smaller size of the bun - and subsequently, when chomping down on it, you don't get that overwhelmingly delicious taste of duck - it is taken over by the thick bun. Otherwise the food was good - duck tasted very well. Chinese restaurant service is.. well, as expected - so no positive or negatives to mention there.",0.9536,0.872,0.095,0.033,0.4666447811447812

It's a huge restaurant and they did seem to be quite busy with a large group in the back. It took them quite awhile to get to us and to take our orders. We asked to have an additional duck added to our order. After about 20 minutes (some people had food already) they came out to inform us they had no extra ducks. This would have been fine if they had told us this initially, but at this point we were all quite hungry after watching some of our friends finish their food. When the ducks did finally come out they were delicious. It was my first time with duck and I really enjoyed it - particularly the fried rice. It's BYOB but with a corkage fee as they have a full bar there. Aside from the service issues, the food was all quite good and I will go back, but with a smaller group and ensuring that we requested the exact number of ducks ordered.",0.9779,0.859,0.134,0.008,0.41904761904761906

THEN came duck fried rice and duck soup? YES. my thoughts after: when can we go back? i'd probably bring one or two more people to share this delightful duck with. so maybe we can order some sides and try some of their other things too... again, we eat a lot of duck. :/",0.985,0.796,0.165,0.039,0.5629800754800756

You may need more buns for the duck though.  We ran out of buns but still had duck meat left.  It was great that they cut up the duck at the table before serving it to you. Everything is super fresh! Service was great and the prices were good too! The Peking Duck (which came with the fried rice and soup) was about $37. Split between 8 people, thats about a little less than $5 per person.  Totally worth it!

Paper plates with specials taped to the wall, yes. Big cavernous dining room, yes. BYOB, yes.  Make a reservation and pre-order the duck. As far as I can tell this place is always packed and you want to make sure you get your fists on this animal. We ordered other dishes as well but in my mind that's not why you visit here. They're far over shadowed. The bird is carved at your table. DO NOT IGNORE THE SKIN. Eat all of it. Make sure you use the duck sauce. Make sure you come hungry so you get every last morsel.

2012-04-05,4.0,"Seriously, you can't get better value for your money. Came here last night with a group of 9, had a crazy good meal, drank plentifully, and enjoyed good company... it came out to just under $20/person. Left stuffed and didn't drop a fortune. I will for sure be back. This place is authentic as hell and in my opinion, one of the best Chinese places outside of Chinatown. (Food for thought: because I'm Chinese, should I just call it town?) But really, I've had Peking Duck in Beijing at the self proclaimed ""creator of the Peking Duck"" and I give Sun Wah my approval. We started with plenty of apps. My friends are white so they got the chicken potstickers. Not really impressive and store bought. I have a big qualm with Chinese restaurants that don't home make their food and instead order it from an outside vendor. Skip these. They were greasy anyways. The butterfly shrimp appetizer was damn good. Although expensive at $13, it was a large order of butterflied jumbo shrimp with bacon on top and sauteed in a delicious sauce. Although the bacon was not too crispy, the flavor with the shrimp and sauce was spot on. So good, definitely get this.  They were out of the stuffed peppers (with shrimp) and were a bit confused when we ordered cuz it's not on the menu (or is it?) and we were disappointed. We opted for the squid. This was pretty good too but not too memorable. Crispy and good flavor. A little rubbery but it's squid, last time I checked they don't just melt in your mouth.  Obviously, call ahead and order the duck. They carve it table side and the skin pretty much melts in your mouth. For $37 (shared by 4+), this comes with steamed baos and pickled daikon, carrots, green onions, and duck sauce for you to make delicious sandwiches. You can also eat the succulent duck over white rice. You have your choice for them to make fried rice or noodles with the leftover duck meat and since we ordered 2 ducks we tried one of each. The noodles were far better. The bones are then cooked in a soup. Also comes with 2 scoops of strawberry sorbet. Again, so good for so cheap.  Take Sun Wah for what it is... a busy Chinese restaurant and not Next/Alinea. Meaning the service will be quick, the servers will often be rude and rushed, and they probably won't speak much English. i.e. they were putting up chairs while the restaurant was still packed and the lady at the cashier had her baby in her arms while working the register... Only at a Chinese restaurant! It's true, the service is not great but the food speaks for itself. Plus, last time I checked nobody went to a restaurant and said 'that place was great, the food sucked but the service was incredible!'  Note: Sun Wah is BYOB but charges $5 corkage fee per wine bottle and $2 PER bottle of beer. Don't bring a 6 pack... grab a couple 40's or tall boys if you insist on beer.

It's very informal and many families and large parties come to dine here, so don't expect any quiet peace to yourself. Overall, it's good times. The food: I'm pretty new to Sun Wah. I've only been here three times and I've only ordered small variants of the same thing each time. Peking Duck + Some Pork over Rice. It's $6. Why wouldn't I order that every time?!? It's $6!!! It is nowhere--I repeat NOWHERE--near the best Chinese duck or pork, but dammit I will not turn down a rice plate at Sun Wah. Mix that in with that bargain of a deal, and the food is just elevated for the value you get. The duck is typically produced en masse, and sometimes you get a better specimen than other times, but it's good nonetheless. I think I'm a bigger fan of the roast park than I am the BBQ pork now that I've had both. The rice is nothing special--in fact one time it was a little stale and hard. Nothing that mixing the rice with the juices dripping off the meat won't fix, however. The service: Could be better. It's a large dining area, though, so hey, I understand it may be a little difficult to see a tiny table off in the corner. No biggie. Other: Credit Card is $10 minimum from what I remember.

Duck bursts with flavor and is, thus, awesome. So, an entire meal based around duck has to be incroyable, n'est-ce pas? Oui. Ouuuuiiiii. Why am I speaking in broken French? I have no idea. Wait. I do. It's the duck. Duck does stuff to ya, man! Come for the duck feast. Call ahead. Gather up some friends. Wish you had a Yanyao in your life and get ready to grub. The duck comes out, perfectly crispy and ready for some eatin'. Not only are the preparations delicious, the gist of the feast is to eat the entire bird. There's no (or, little) waste. This is conscious consumerism at its most literal... and satisfying. So, do you like your duck: 1.) Carved off the bird, served with hoisin, scallions, daikon, and carrots and with as much bao as you can stuff in your mouth; 2.) Made into a soup with veggies and spicy broth (don't skimp on the rooster sauce); 3.) Folded into noodles with carrots, mushrooms, onions, and pea shoots; 4.) Stir-fried into rice with tactile pleasures a'plenty; 5.) Eaten alongside bbq pork and water spinach (put this in your bao sandwich); 6.) Complimented with a ginger liquor drink that gets the job done and compels you to slap tablemates? 7.) Served with the barest bones of service -- which is not a problem. Take a look around: you're at Sun Wah, not Next. Enjoy the experience for what it -- and the price point -- is. Do you enjoy any of the above? If so, do the feast and roll around patting your belly and smiling for hours after eating. If not, seek Jesus and get your life right. You have problems.

Note: additional baos cost extra, I think ~$3.50 for 6 - The soup (Asian-style, very brothy) was alright - the wintermelon was interesting and the cilantro can be strong for those who don't like. - The fried rice was good and ordinary - I was told that the meat would be used in the rice, but frankly, we couldn't find what they did with the rest of the duck.  - The sorbet was some sort of mango/ginger? It was hard to distinguish because it was very freezer-burned. - On the side, we did get water spinach which was very good and added the green to our meal.

We also tried a couple of appetizers, including the tofu and mushrooms, and egg rolls, which were OK but not great.

2012-01-04,4.0,"Sun Wah is definitely tops for a high quality, interesting inexpensive meal. If you go, definitely order their signature dish, The Beijing Duck Feast. For just $37 (per duck, not per/person) you receive a whole duck prepared three ways: With steamed bau and hoisin suace, duck fried rice, and a duck broth based soup with wintermelon. It is fun watching them expertly carve up the duck tableside for the first presentation. I was dining with two friends and there was the perfect amount of food for three people to have a feast (four could share one duck if not overly hungry). We asked our server if he recommended that we order anything else, or if the Beijing Duck was sufficient; he suggested that the only a la carte item we add was the Chinese Broccoli so we had a vegetable accompaniment. We took his advice and this worked out great.  FYI it is highly recommended that you order the Beijing Duck Feast when you make reservations; it is off the menu and is not guaranteed to be available if not ordered in advance (reservations are only available via telephone and not on Open Table). If the Duck Feast does not sound appealing, there is an extensive a la carte menu available featuring a variety of Chinese cuisine with staples such as sweet and sour chicken all the way to exotic options such as the rice soup with pork stomach, kidney and intestines.  Sun Wah has a very large space and a casual, laid back atmosphere. There is ample street parking (metered parking on Broadway, but free parking on the side streets if you do not mind a short walk); the #36 Broadway bus takes you right there and the Argyle red line stop will get you close. While to food is as good as you can get for a cheap eat venue (and better than many moderately priced restaurants), do not expect upscale ambiance or service. No complaints about the service or ambiance, but just kind of plain. All three presentations of the duck were great, especially the first presentation (with the steamed bau) and the duck fried rice.  The Beijing Duck Feast also includes a small dessert; two scoops of homemade sorbet (ours was strawberry). The dessert was the only oddity of the night. Apparently irregardless of your party size they bring out two bowls, each with one small scoop (and the sorbet though good, was frozen solid; we had been discussing Grant Achatz over dinner and I joked that they must have poured some liquid nitrogen over the sorbet). It would be nice if they would bring one bowl per person (or at least offer extra bowls for a nominal surcharge). The sorbet comes with the bill and is also accompanied by fortune cookies (apparently I am supposed to be very cautious of my friends)!  Adding to the incredible bargain, Sun Wah permits BYOB for minimal corkage despite having a limited bar. According to their website the corkage is $5 per bottle of wine and $2 per bottle of beer, but our server must have really liked us as we were not charged a corkage. They definitely keep you well hydrated as in addition to ice water, you are also brought a pitcher of hot black tea soon after you are seated. The final tab (including tax and a fairly generous tip) came to just $20 per/person for the three of us; an amazing deal and quite painless (especially after a recent meal at Alinea where the tax alone far exceeded tonight's total bill)! This is the type of venue that would appeal to just about anybody and is well worth traveling to from other parts of the city.",0.9976,0.829,0.15,0.02,0.5464486921529175

It's a nice tradition of dining at a Chinese restaurant for Peking duck on Christmas that's been shown everywhere from A Christmas Story to unofficial yelp gatherings.  The ambiance is very cafeteria, VFW banquet hall, or church meeting room. Unromantical, crowded, and banal.  The service is very abrupt and cut and dry.  With the Peking duck service you get: Teapot. Duck carved tableside with little buns and veggies and a fantastic sauce. The sauce was very good and the crispier duck skin was aces. Duck soup and duck fried rice. The soup was a bit bland but we liked the broth and veggies. Ice cream I didn't eat any but my guest didn't like it and that's saying something since he likes ice cream so much he built a shrine to it in his freezer. I was pleased they served us family style even though dining on Christmas alone would indicate we are from broken homes. I was not pleased by the $5 corkage fee and when I asked for extra veggies and he  nodded then brought back a mountain without saying that would be $4.50. $4.50 for sliced carrots?! Um if you mentioned it when I asked I'd have skipped it. That corkage fee is (besides illegal, but openly accepted) a scounch high.  The duck itself.

2011-12-20,5.0,"Can any restaurant with 500 yelp reviews qualify for a best kept secret in Chicago?  Perhaps I am simply late to the party, but this is THE place to go for whole roast duck.  As an aficionado of duck and a long time visitor of Andersonville and Uptown, I am somewhat embarrassed that I have only just eaten here.  But I will atone for my time spent in the wilderness by returning here again, and again, and again. Begin your odyssey into duck as follows - call ahead, make a reservation, request a whole roasted duck.  Shortly after you arrive, a server will come out with a whole roasted duck, and expertly carve that duck for your pleasure and entertainment.  Viewing her work is a mouth watering experience that is still somewhat of a blur, like the freefall the first time you go sky diving.  But unlike skydiving, after it is over you have a juicy, crispy plate full of duck waiting for you. Now, that would be one HELL of a business plan.  But I digress. When it comes to whole roast duck, this is simply the best I've had in the city.  Not only for the price, which is the definition of value, but for the quality.  This duck has ridiculously crispy skin, oozes with juices and melts in your mouth. The duck order also comes with warm sticky buns, julienned carrots, green onions, and pickled daikon.  Save some of the duck for do it yourself sliders, and you may just bite into one of the best sandwiches ever.  Soft, crispy, juicy, all in one heavenly bite. But there is more -  the duck option also comes with two huge sides to share at your table, both of which are served - counter intuitively - after the duck: a big bowl of duck soup and a heaping plate of fried rice.  However, you may substitute noodles for fried rice, and I strongly suggest you do so.  Aurore L. clued me in to this option, and it is superb - the noodles are stereo wire thin, somehow both chewy and crispy, and infiltrated with duck meat, carrots, pea pods, mushrooms and onions.  It would have been the best duck dish I have ever had, if I didn't just have it the course before.  The soup was excellent as well, but somewhat of an afterthought for us, as it was served last, and feeling gluttonous, we ordered egg rolls and the fried soft shell crab in addition to the duck feast.  Both were also ridiculously good - in particular, the fried soft shell crab has a glorious kick of heat mixed in to the soft flesh.  Amazing. Sun Wah has a limited wine selection but is also BYOB, and your best option is the latter - pick an Old World white, like a dry Riesling, Vouvray, or Gewürztraminer,  You'll want the minerality to stand up to the fat in the duck and the other fried side dishes and the fullness to cut the heat.  Given how little you'll spend on dinner, you can easily spend $20 - $30 at the wine store, but a $10 Languedoc white from The Disco served us splendidly. So what is the catch?  Atmosphere and service.  You are eating in a cavernous cafeteria, and service is textbook lassez faire.  In our case, the duck arrived before the appetizers, but I don't mind because it all came quite fast.  We got our wine glasses quickly, which was most important, and were left alone for the remainder of our dinner.

The Peking duck dinner is $37 for a whole roast duck, carved in front of the diners and served in three stages:  1) The duck skin and meat are carved and laid out on a plate. Add these to the steamed bun wraps along with scallions and carrot pieces.  2) The rest of the duck meat is made into a fried rice dish.  3) The remaining bones are made into a soup with winter melon and cilantro.  Crispy skin, tender succulent meat, and they serve $4 beers. I'm used to wraps that are more like pancakes, but nothing wrong with their slightly sweet steamed bun wraps. They also give you some radish as a side dish and sherbet for desert - sour stuff helps all the food go down.  Your clothes will smell like food afterwards but it will be well worth it. You'll likely have some leftovers too.",0.9696,0.883,0.11,0.006,0.465432098765432
2011-11-30,4.0,"Our group of 5 dined here for their infamous Beijing duck dinner. I dutifully made our reservations and reserved the duck dinner for the table. Tuesday night at 630 and the place was pretty empty, but by 7pm it was starting to quickly fill up.  Along with the duck dinner we ordered some Chinese Broccoli and a seafood dinner special.  Once all the food arrived at the table, it didn't look like there was going to be enough. But at the end of dinner, we were all satisfied and I was the lucky recipient of our duck leftovers. Leftovers! Our meal came to about $15 per person.  Not too shabby. The duck is delicious. It's a fatty fowl, but delicious and flavorful. The crispy skin adds some texture and crunch and is soooo worth the splurge.  The fluffy white buns you get to make little duck ""sammies"" with are wonderful.  It's like bao dough only BETTER. It's as good as my mom's siopao dough and that's saying a lot.  Add some daikon and plum sauce and it's a delectable treat.  The duck soup and the duck fried rice were just OK. I'd rather just eat more bao and duck sammies the next time I visit.  Or get the noodles--I've heard the duck and noodles are out of this world.  Chinese Broccoli was very fresh, well steamed but not overdone at all. I like the place--airy and open with lots of exposed brick.  Our original server was OK, but she disappeared on us leaving us asking another server and a busser for all our needs.  Eh, they ended up taking good care of us in the end.",0.9967,0.735,0.225,0.04,0.5501587301587302
2011-11-21,5.0,"Full review blogged: E-mails to Sun Wah BBQ are responded to promptly and signed ""quack quack!  kelly"" - I mention this not only for the humor but also because it is important to know that e-mailing or calling is a good idea since the enormous restaurant fills up quickly and in order to guarantee one of the off-menu ""Beijing Duck Feats"" a reservation is more or less required.  Oh sure they take walk-ins and the menu tops one hundred items, many of which both look and sound delicious, but honestly I just can't imagine going to Sun Wah and not ordering the duck, a $37 three course prix-fixe easily large enough to feed a group of four, especially after a full night of dining at Alinea et al. and breakfast at Bleeding Heart Bakery and Café. With our waiter seemingly serving at least half the restaurant it would be a short delay before he would return - this time with a large pot of black tea, glasses of water, and ready to field questions and take any additional orders despite his warning that ""the duck is very much for three"" - a warning we clearly ignored opting for two more plates of the twenty or so that sounded unique, appealing, and shockingly low priced and with black tea poured we sat and took in the scene as plate after plate and bowl after bowl streamed from the kitchen. Rather expecting our additional courses to arrive first since I really had no idea how long it takes to prepare a proper authentic Peking Duck I was surprised when a mere twenty-five minutes after seating a cart rolled up next to our table and a two plates of steamed bao, pickled daikon radishes, celery, carrots, and hoisin sauce were delivered by our server.  Greeted with a smile and ""hi"" the next five minutes would be a tableside show well worth the price of admission as the young woman in charge carefully cleaned the duck setting the skin on one side of the plate and the meat on the other while discarding the fat and preserving the body of the bird with a great degree of skill.  Smiling as she delivered the plate to our table and subsequently returning the cart to the kitchen it was at this point that I first realized our server was absolutely right - even without accounting for the other courses this was a whole lot of food. With the duck now on the table and each of us tasting the slightly sweet and entirely crispy skin before gathering up the bao and garnishes I can only speak for myself when I say that although not the ""best"" or most ""prestigious"" duck I've ever tasted this dish instantaneously committed me to putting more ethnic restaurants on my travel agendas in the future.  Crunchy and savory, sweet and moist, and all the better with a slathering of the sweet hoisin and some vegetables on a pillow of bao. With the second duck course being prepared our two additional items would arrive along with bowls, spoons, and more silverware making me suddenly realize that the ""table for six"" I'd originally seen was barely enough room for three with all this food but all things being equal considering the price and quality of the food I was okay with an overabundance, beginning first with a ""small"" order of ""Mike's Fried Chicken"" that seemed anything but small unless compared directly to the duck and although largely similar in texture to the duck  a dish I was glad to experience due to the flavor unique flavor notes of chili and onion permeating the skin along with a slightly funky sweet undertone that I couldn't quite place. Moving on to our second bonus dish I decided to order something with Fish Balls as I'd heard great things about those at Sun Wah and on discussion with my dining partners we opted for a bowl of Fish ball and Shrimp dumpling noodle soup, a clear broth teaming with dried seafood flavors and large well cooked pieces of celery, bok choy, and onion plus a handful of ramen style noodles, four large Har Gow, and at least six ping-pong ball sized fish balls teaming with the flavors of what I believe was cod but infinitely smoother, a texture something akin to a hardboiled egg yolk but vastly more delicious. Working slowly on the duck, soup, and chicken and realizing that we were either leaving leftovers or taking some home for later the second course of our Beijing Duck feast would arrive in a portion nearly twice that of the first with a bowl of duck broth, parsley, and winter-melon containing at least a liter of fluid and a plate of hearty duck fried rice with bits of dark meat, bamboo shoots, plenty of soy, and small chopped scallions that easily topped three cups in cooked size.  With both nicely prepared and plenty of duck flavor to be noted I have to say that I felt somewhat bad sending much of the broth back to the kitchen and boxing up nearly 2 cups of the rice simply to save capacity for dinner later but at the same time I hear from my sister that it reheated quite well two days later for lunch en route back to Ohio and that it tasted even better as leftovers.",0.9989,0.833,0.145,0.022,0.4680981505752147

I called to see if I could make a reservation for 35 people for a Friday night and get details on any minimums, deposits, etc.  The woman who ultimately took my reservation was a little hard to understand and later, when I called back to add 3 people, she didn't seem to be able to find my original reservation (but took my new res again).  Confused, I stopped by in person a few days later and talked to Kelly to confirm the event. She was wonderful! She said that they actually have a policy to not take reservations for large parties on a Friday night (*note to readers!) but since I'd already made the reservation she'd make an exception. She then told me to email me the food I wanted to order a week or so ahead of time so they'd be sure to have enough. I perused the menu with my fiance (mouth-watering the whole time) made calculations and considerations and finally emailed our order to Kelly. Less than 24 hours later I get an email back from her not just to confirm my order but also to make suggestions on where I had too *much* food or too similar dishes! Who does that???

We had a reservation, got seated early, but waited oh a good 20 minutes before someone took our order and mind you the place wasn't crowded. We were greated by a grumpy old man as our server. I placed the order, he couldn't fully understand me. I resorted to pointing at things on the menu. I asked for this sauce that goes along with the roast pork dish. It's oil, green onions and something else. Well he brings that out and it's ice cold. It's clumped together so you can't even dip anything in it. So out comes the pork accompanied by duck...duck which we didn't order. The food was brought out by someone else. Our server comes around, all testy and says, NO YOU ORDERED DUCK and points at duck at the service ticket written in Chinese, which I can't read because I'm not Chinese. Umm, well that's not what we ordered. He said, well take it and leaves it at the table, so we really don't have a choice. RUDE. I ask him to warm up the sauce that is ice cold and he gives me the DIRTIEST look ever. Are you freaking serious? Dude, if you hate your job, quit. Comes back and kind of chucks it at the table. Our dishes slowly come out, one by one brought by everyone BUT our server who doesn't check on us after that whole episode with the sauce. Bitter old man. What is messed up is we get our check, the duck is on there PLUS 15% gratuity. Are you serious? For that service? We didn't even have a party of 6 or more and the jerk put that on there. It was also an inconvenience to have our food wrapped up for us. We didn't order the duck, so we had to take that home...we paid for it. We had pork to take home, we asked for sauce...WELL WE HAVE TO CHARGE YOU for it. That's fine...the guy packing up the food then rolled his eyes. If you don't like serving people, don't be a server.

Friday nights expect to see lots of tables reserved for those that have pre ordered their Beijing Duck. You do need a reservation if that's what you're interested in. The duck is served with rice, veggies, various condiments, and bao. It's carved table side and then the carcass is taken back to the kitchen and made into soup.

Portions are huge so I usually get one of their ""Barbecue Over Rice"" plates which consist of a generous portion of meat, rice, and some bok choi. I love their Chinese Broccoli, so one order of that with 2 ""over rice"" plates makes a great meal for two. All for about $20.

Progress is being made. This place was bustling at about 6:30 with many people waiting for take out at the entryway counter. You can see the ducks and pigs hanging in this area and being portioned out for orders. We had to wait a short while for the table so we passed the time watching the cooks ""hacking and packing"" pork and duck for the take away customers. We started out with a small order of roast pork. Very good. Tender pork pieces with the crunchy skin attached. Very nice. I love stuff like this. I have been to China many, many times for business in the past and this type of restaurant and cuisine brought back memories of some pleasurable dining. The Chinese know their way around duck and pork roasting for sure. My wife and I shared the Beijing duck dinner for our main course. It has the duck carved table side, and comes with some steamed buns, spring onion and carrot shreds, sauce, etc. You take a bun, put in some of the duck meat, crisp duck skin, spring onion/carrot shreds and some of the dark sauce and........enjoy! The duck was so moist and full of flavor. This was a tasty duck for sure.  This dinner also comes with fried rice and soup both made from the remnants of the ducks after carving. There is a lot of food there and we wound up having to take some of it home with us, which is OK by me because it makes for some tasty treats the next day. One other note: We had some Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce which was cooked just right. They also serve Tiger beer. An Asian favorite. Try it if you have never had it before Atmosphere is not much, but it is really exactly as it should be for a Chinese BarBQue spot if you know what I mean.  Service was good and efficient.

Haha, you dirty birdy.  It was a beautiful almost-Autumn day when I made my way to Sun Wah. I had a bounce in my step and a breeze of happy surrounding me. I was going to see the wonderful wizards of fowl. Because of the wonderful things I heard they can do with my favorite poultry, duck. I've been let down by others. Their duck either being too fatty, dry, or sickeningly juicy. Oh, how I yearned for a place that could deliver a tender, succulent duck with a crispy skin. Yes. I did yearn.  I yearn no more, dear reader. Sun Wah came through when they put their duck down on me. I was with a group and we ordered duck o'plenty. The ducks were expertly carved and served with side dishes and a soup. So, you get these doughy rolls --the kind bao are made with. Then you layer on some veggies they bring, and some duck, and then some sauce, and more duck. Then you devour. Grrrrr! Yes. You growl from how tasty it is.  I honestly can't tell you what the side dishes were called. It was some watercressy dish in sauce and some noodle dish in sauce. I can tell you it all became happily acquainted in my bell-ay. The people serving us were cool. The lady at the bar was a doll. My bottle of ginger pop was only $1.50. Joy. You must let the wonderful wizards of fowl put it down on you, as well. I want more, and to try other things. I'm now a Sun Wah groupie. I am not ashamed.",0.994,0.813,0.16,0.027,0.6306481481481482

2011-09-06,3.0,"The new incarnation of Sun Wah is a pretty decent Hong Kong style barbecue house.  However, I do miss the original Sun Wah, or rather, the food that the Argyle shop offered. For example, pea pod tips were on the menu (although not always available), and the Hong Kong pork came with almost 1/4 inch of actual fat and rind. The menu of the new location is somewhat less varied than that of the old location. In particular, the seafood selections are a little bit diminished. The Argyle shop had lobster, crab and snails, as well as various fishes, shellfish and so on. This restaurant on Broadway is quite good. The menu selections are augmented by a dozen or so daily specials. As at any barbecue house, you can order carry-out meat directly at the grilling station where it is cut to your order. Presumably the intestines, ears, kidneys and other pig parts are available there too. Service is very good, far beyond competent. The serving staff cooperate, and look after each others' tables. The manager is always walking the floor and double checking what's going on. Every now and again, the manager serves, or helps serve. When we ate there one time, our order was primarily meat, vegetables and soup (our decision). A busboy later dropped off a small bowl of rice, gratis, and right he was. A little bit of rice complemented our meal very well. How did he know? The staff --- all of the staff --- is paying attention to the customers. The dining area is relatively new. The skylight gives it nice light. The Broadway store has a larger, cleaner, brighter and less cluttered dining area than did the Argyle store. Price. Prices are very reasonable, almost inexpensive.

At one point, one of the people at my table walked up to the main counter and brought back two pitchers of water.

The duck was fantastic, though admittedly one duck probably isn't big enough to serve nine people. They bring out little bao buns, sauce, and little vegetable strips to make mini-duck sandwiches that are great. Also, don't forget to get some of that crispy duck skin. I also love how they roll the duck around and carve it at the table - it's a wonderful opening number before the main attraction. But the rest of the food we got to go with that duck?

I had been to the hole in the wall on Argyle St. it had been before it expanded into the new place on Broadway. I wasn't much impressed with it back then. I'm still not impressed. Lord knows I wanted to be, but after two visits, I can pretty much state unequivocally that this place only does one thing well.  It serves really good duck. It sucks at serving actual customers. The servers cut an entire roast duck at the tableside with a skill that I just plain envy. My own bird-cutting attempts end up looking like the aftermath of a crazed killing spree. I've only had one bad dish - and it is consistently bad: the fried rice. It is treated like an afterthought, and overcooked until bone-dry. The service - judging from the other reviews is and always has been poor. Servers wander from table to table, either unassigned or without discipline (which I specifically blame on crappy, uncaring management). Each time I have been there, I've had at least three different servers. Most of them are sullen, like they would much rather be somewhere else, or simply dislike having to serve the customers.  Case in point: the last time I was there, we two different servers (since the first one appeared to have forgotten us) asked for extra buns (I call them ""foldy"" buns, as they look like little coin purses, able to hold food), the server came back and told me that they were only for people ordering the whole duck. I understand portion control, but this seemed stupidly stingy - one can walk down the street to Tai Nam Supermarket and get an entire bag of frozen ones for less than $2. The first server actually came back with buns and an older Chinese woman (the mother of the owner, I later learned) stormed over and yelled at the server in Mandarin.  In front of us. And the rest of the packed restaurant. My dining companion told me that the woman was complaining how he was wasting food on people not buying the whole duck, and that she was going to charge us double for the buns, how our server was stupid, etc. I was aghast. We quickly finished our dinner and left. My friend and I took a moment to speak to one of the owners (Kelly, i think) about the issue, and the young woman seemed to - succinctly put - not give a rat's ass. She looked bored when I explained the problem, and angry when my buddy told her that he spoke and understood Chinese, and what the older woman had said in a corded restaurant was incredibly embarrassing and shameful. Kelly turned and left without a word. Clearly, the management of Sun-Wah is far more interested in clearing tables than actually keeping them filled. Yes, the food is good (except, as noted before, the fried rice), but what good is that if the service is punctuated by an indifferent, disorganized wait staff governed by an old woman who treats them like slaves and managed by her two kids who have zero customer service skills? Thanks but no thanks. There are plenty of other Asian food places in this neighborhood, and they manage to offer pleasant service. It gets two stars because the food is good. Their demeanor is their downfall.",-0.9852,0.75,0.1,0.15,0.4747600008016674

The only thing that detracted was I thought the soup broth should have been more aromatic, with a little more attention to seasoning. The barbecue is fantastic and I highly recommend the restaurant just for the duck but the spare ribs and salt baked chicken are worthwhile too. This is definitely an everyday restaurant for everyday budgets, so don't go expecting the kind of service you'd get at a place like Charlie Trotters. They are just attentive enough, but can seem a bit indifferent.

2011-07-04,4.0,"I heard about the Sun Wah BBQ from a friend in North Carolina who had seen it on the Food Network and told me about the Peking duck feast.  Upon returning to Chicago, I immediately looked up this restaurant and waited with anticipation to visit with a friend in town. As I learned from my research, I called ahead to reserve a table and reserved a duck.  We had read how the duck feast was enough to serve 4 or even 6 people ... so we really had little interest in filling up on anything else on our visit.  The place is very big.  It's casual and it's sort of a no-nonsense place.  After a group in front of us lining up to see the hostess left because they hadn't called to reserved a duck or table, I was happy that I had. Another great thing is that while Sun Wah serves some beer and wine, BYOB is welcome and we stopped an purchased a nice bottle of Pinot Noir to pair with our duck feast.  We watched the servers prepare the duck at the other tables and got increasingly hungry and excited ourselves.  Finally, our duck arrived, beautiful, crispy and golden brown.  The server had obviously cut a lot of ducks in her life and a lot that night.  She was methodical in carving the duck and placing the pieces in a beautiful and deliberate display on the serving platter. Soft rolls, pickled roots, and a platter of duck and she was off with the carcass to return to the chicken and we went to work on the duck.  You eat the soft rolls with duck, pickled roots, spices and sauces to your tasting.  There are also little cut pieces of crispy, duck skin to enjoy.  It was AMAZING.  I am not exaggerating.  Then the server returned with the duck fried rice which was fabulous (personally I like it with a lot of soy sauce and we determined that the hot pepper infused oil and soy made a great combination on the duck fried rice).  And the remaining carcass is used to make a duck soup.  The duck soup was fine, but in all honesty, nothing special.  It's really just a light egg drop soup with some duck bones in it.  But everything else was wonderful and beautiful. I've already promised to bring my other friend the next time he's in Chicago.  On my first visit, without any other appetizers or food ordered, two of us (we pushed ourselves) pretty much knocked down the whole duck feast.  We planned to have a lot to take home but had none.  So, next time if it is just the two of us, I will get the duck but possibly order an appetizer or two ... I'd really like to try the BBQ pork that many rave about. I love this place.  I am so glad I heard about it and went and truly consider it a Chicago treasure that everyone should experience just once (and by experience, I do mean call ahead and reserve a Peking duck feast because that's what makes this place special).  Bring a bottle or some beer ... and enjoy a relaxed, casual, AMAZING duck feast!",0.9982,0.8,0.183,0.017,0.5998252442002442

Even after we were seated, we had to wait about 20 minutes for our food. The servers, while very efficient, are not particularly friendly. It can be hard to get their attention, and you will likely have to wait a few minutes to get your bill at the end. But none of that matters, because this is the very best duck I have ever had! Order the Beijing Duck Feast. It's not on the menu, but if you just ask for the duck dinner they'll know what you mean. This incredible meal comes with three courses. 1. Peking duck, freshly cut. It's served with steamed mantou buns that are RIDICULOUS good. So much better than the lame tortilla-things that most restaurants serve with Peking duck. This part is by far the best of the meal. Perfect crispy skin, savory duck, amazing plum sauce, perfection! 2. Duck soup, made from the bones of your duck. Be careful not to swallow the bones! But it is oh so good! Some of the best broth I have ever had. 3. Duck fried rice. This is the weak link of the trio, but it's still very tasty.  More than enough to feed three people, and it only costs $37.

I mention to him that I saw a place with hanging ducks by the window and its always packed. So I sparked his curiosity and we decided to give it a try. I have to say we went on a busy night because  the wait line was huge and the place was super packed. So after a 30 minute wait, we were excited to try this duck. The first time we ate there we had the Peking Duck platter, which was pieces of Peking Duck cut into stripes over white rice and it was also served with a duck egg ( just half of it). That dish was $5.25. We also ordered fried scallops which were also great and that was $8.50. Our bill with taxes and tip came out to $25. Now the second time we ate there I invited my parents and we all shared a whole duck. Now you have the option to just order just a duck for $17.95 and you can order additional side dishes, but we ordered the whole duck course which included: A whole Peking Duck, A big bowl of duck broth soup, fried rice, pickled onions with carrots and 6 steamed buns. All of that was enough for the four of us and that came out to $46 with tax and tip. I so recommend this place for its delicious food.

Beef chow fun was fine, although a little greasy.  I definitely wish there were more vegetables in this dish like I have had at Chinese restaurants in NYC and Philly. The ha moon mai fun was ok, but a little too salty for my taste.  Would definitely ask in future to tone down the sodium. Finally the walnut shrimp....we both did not like this dish at all.  However, for the sake of complete disclosure, my boyfriend and I had no idea what this dish was when we picked it. We were a little surprised to see a dozen huge lightly battered and fried shrimp drenched in a savory, custard looking sauce with sugared walnuts on the side.  We just couldn't get past the heaviness of the sauce and the strange texture difference between the fried shrimp and the sauce.  I would definitely recommend asking for the sauce on the side.",0.9979,0.672,0.31,0.018,0.4645261437908497

The roast pork here is especially great for the fact that the meat is actually flavorful but not overbearing with the bean paste.

The staff is all very nice and attentive and they are so efficient....they done this so many times.  They are famous for their peking duck and you definitely should make reservations, otherwise you will have to wait, unless you get there before 6pm. The Peking duck feast is where they roll out a cart to your table and they carve the duck beautifully in front of you.  You get a platter of duck and skin and 6 buns with 3 side dishes of hoison sauce, thinly matchstick carrots and green onions and a dish of pickled vegetables to put into your buns.  They take the duck carcass back to the kitchen and later will bring out to you duck fried rice and duck soup.  The duck feast is $37.   Ordered extra white buns for $3.50 and it was worth it because we had leftovers for the next day. I've been to many Chinese banquets and eaten Peking duck lots in the USA, but I have to say that this is the BEST!!!  It had crispy skin and tender meat and so delicious!   The beef chow fun noodles and Chinese brococoli were both  delicious and one of  the BEST I've had.  The won ton soup was very good too, but I found the broth a bit salty for me.

2011-05-15,2.0,"This is one of those places where the customer service makes the otherwise good food taste like a wet sock. Been there twice and, unfortunately, was served by the rudest server (Chuck) both times. The first time we met him, about 10 minutes into eating our food, he asked us if we wanted boxes and kept coming back to ask the same question ... even after we told him that we need time eating since we did order quite a number of dishes. We felt rushed and unnecessarily so,seeing how there was no queue of people waiting for a table. But we laughed it off telling ourselves that he probably used to work at the Container Store and thus is obssessed with boxes/boxing stuff. The second and what will be my last time, we asked for the peking duck and bbq'd chicken but was told that since it's almost closing time, he cannot serve us anything bbq'd. Ok, understood. But after seeing a couple who came in after us being served bbq'd chicken, we asked another server who confirmed that yes that IS bbq'd chicken and yes they are still serving it. When we asked Chuck about it, the two of them talked in Chinese, concluding to the other server retracting his previous statement. We were annoyed but, oh well, wouldn't let him ruin our dinner.

After I asked Chuck about it, he said 'oh' and offered me the to-go dish that my friend ordered for her husband. Seriously. To offer me another person's food as a peace offering is just demented, a simple apology and an effort to check kitchen for wonton soup would've been more appropriate.  Yes, the food is good.

I can't say I've had the pleasure of being at the old location, but from what I hear, it wasn't that pleasant but the food was good.

I'm a fan of most things on the menu here...just not some of the fish...I'm picky with my fish, and that's not Sun Wah's fault. It's also cheap and that's great if you want great food without the price range to go with it. They are AWESOME for big groups so bring everyone you know and most likely they can accommodate you. And yes! They have beer! I can go on and on about the many dishes here, but I'm not because the only thing you need to wonder about and order every time is the duck. GET THE DUCK. Get. The. Duck. Do you hear me?? It's awesome, and I don't consider myself a duck eater usually. But here....oh my gods you'll be full for days if you eat enough of it. And they slice it right in front of you, so if you have only veggie eaters with you, you may want to have them look away. And not only do you get sliced pieces of heaven to eat between Bao-like buns, they take the remainders of the duck and bring you duck fried rice and soup made with the bones! Yes, that last part sounds disgusting, but NO! It's delicious! The bones flavor the broth, and holy crap is it good. Just don't be alarmed if you somehow find a piece of spine in your soup. I would also call ahead and reserve one if that's what you plan to eat. And you will, because I said so.  The staff is nice and quick and amazing and friendly.

Great spot for parties and groups as long as you make reservations ahead of time. We ordered their famous Beijing duck dinner (only $35 total) and boy oh boy was that TOTALLY worth the CHEAP price!  I think this is one of the best peking duck  i've had - the meat is really tender and juicy with amazing flavor and perfectly crisped skins.   But what I REALLY loved was the Mantou bread that came with the dish to make it duck ""sandwiches."" I think this is some of the best mantou i've had in chicago - it was really soft, flavorful with perfect amount of moisture from steaming. We ordered a second tray of mantou and i ate my fourth mantou without any duck in it!  A broth soup came afterwards that reminded me of the Taiwanese meatball soup that my mom always make - it's very comforting, light, and helps ""cleanse your palate"" after eating all of that duck and manto.  Lastly, a fried rice was served - that was just ordinary chinese fried rice.

They carve the duck at the table side and left so much meat on the bone that even my 17 year old daughter noticed and made comment. The waiter said that they use the rest of the duck to make the soup and duck fried rice which is included in the hefty $38 price. However, it appeared that much of the remaining meat left on the carcass did not appear in the fried rice or the soup. The Peking duck was good but is not actually made with the real Peking duck cooking method, the duck broth tasted like it was made with a boullion cube and the fried rice was nothing special and tasted like any other type of fried rice. We would have been better off separately ordering their roast duck which at least one could be sure was the entire duck for $16.75 with all its meat still attached to it and actually served on your table instead of next to it and then wheeled away, a plate of fried rice and soup. We also ordered beef chow fun and they put spicy green chilis in the dish. Really? The normal, authentic recipe for chow fun is NOT spicy. While the waiter apologized nicely, he made no effort to make up for that error. It's still in my refrigerator and no one will touch it. Ever since this restaurant moved from its former, humble storefront around the corner on Argyle, they have gotten farther and farther away from authentic, economic Chinese dishes.

The duck is awesome (just be sure you aren't on a diet).  They leave juicy pieces of fat and skin on the meat slices, which go well with the freshly steamed gua bao (love the bread) and condiments.  Be sure to go with at least 2 others, as the duck can get salty after awhile but can be avoided if you have enough mouths.  Try to be one of those that claim one of the leg pieces.  The duck fried rice and duck soup is pretty good too, not nothing to drool over but a nice schtick for a duck-based meal.  If they give you the choice between rice and noodles, go with the rice unless you want salt-induced high blood pressure from duck noodles. 4 stars because the noisy crowded atmosphere reminds me of HK, 3.5 based on food alone.  Also, there always seems to be a group of white ppl that order the suckling pig (go big or go home?) every night.  Props to them.",0.9548,0.83,0.106,0.064,0.5617526455026455

Slow! not their strong point, expect to wait & drool over your neighbor's food. Entertaining. 3. Describe the menu. Holy load of choices. Big four color photos. Laminated. So many good options, favorites are the peking duck, and the veggie dishes. You'll over order and leave stuffed - but it's totally worth it! Wide selection. 4. What was your favorite dish? The calamari & lotus root veggie dish. Daffy. Quack-quack. Peking duck in those yummy buns! Duck and more duck. 5. What recommendation and/or tip would you provide to friends about Sun Wah's?  Get there early. You will have the best luck with the duck. Snack on the fried chicken skin whilst waiting. Order the duck and make a reservation in advance.

2011-04-12,4.0,"WARNING: I seriously have no idea what I ate at Sun Wah last night, but I'm going to do my very best to write a review.  So bear with me. It's all about the duck here, folks. I'd like to start out by saying that I'm not a fan of duck.  It's too gamey and just never tastes good to me.  I'm just not generally down with the duck. My mind was changed, though, at Sun Wah BBQ. I knew when I walked in that duck is what's up at Sun Wah because there are tons of BBQed ducks hanging like ornaments in the front windows.  A little creepy for this super-Caucasian, but once I took stock of my surroundings (total Asian ethnic overload in the Broadway/Argyle area), it seemed perfectly normal.  Enticing, even.  Dare I say I was DTF for some duck? My duck schooling started with some kind duck sandwich.  I'm sure there's a name for it, but it consisted of sliced BBQ duck, some veggies and a sauce nestled in a very soft bread.  I was hesitant for sure, but I was like, ""Whatever.  I'm just going to eat it,"" so I dove in.  Um... I now like duck.  Or at least this duck.  Whatever Sun Wah does to the duck skin is magic because it's super crispy and flavorful.  Seriously.  Go get some duck. Because I was at Sun Wah for some other food website's award ceremony (yes, I cheated on you, Yelp, and I feel guilty), we were treated to a huge Chinese food feast, so my eating didn't stop at the mouth-watering duck.  What can only be described as enough food to feed a small African country was served to us.  Platter after platter of food was presented.  I felt like a princess! Mystery soup (some kind of chicken soup) was really tasty.  A platter of meats like pork belly, brisket, squid, tongue and probably some other things I couldn't identify came next.  I'm kind of weird about fatty meat, so I didn't really eat much of this course, but you can bet your bottom dollar I got down on the dover sole and fried chicken when they came out.  The fish is slightly crisp on the outside and perfectly mild and tender on the inside.  The fried chicken is actually a whole chicken fried similarly to the duck.  Don't expect a thick, bready coating.  Expect a thin, crispy skin encasing a super moist and tender chicken. I know there was more.  Cabbage rolls stuffed with veggies.  Pork belly with jicima.  Tofu with veggies.  Pan fried tofu.  Rice.  Fish balls.  All strange for this usually non-Asian loving palate, but they were all delicious. In the end, my loyalties still lie with Sun Wah's duck.  It's what they're known for and it's what they do best.  So what are you waiting for?  Plan a field trip to Uptown and get some duck!",0.9979,0.768,0.182,0.05,0.5662378167641324

As expected, all of the beers (312, Lolita, Fleur, Sofie, Madame Rose, Pepe Nero, Juliet, Matilda, Pere Jacques) were tasty.   Although this was a special event, all of the dishes prepared can be ordered off of Sun Wah's menu regularly. Food courses in order: 1.  Minced fish nuggets with iceberg lettuce:  In concept this dish sounds a little suspect, but as someone who grew up eating all types of weird minced mystery meats, I can tell you that Sun Wah's minced fish nuggets/balls were deliciously flavorful and not the bad kind of fishy at all.  The sauce was great and the lettuce was refreshing.   2.  Sauteed bok choy:  You can't mess this up!  Delicious. 3.  Pan-fried shrimp with bell peppers, onions, & thai chiles:  One of my favorites of the night.  Shrimp, with its shells on, were pan-fried to crunchy perfection.  It was excellently seasoned. 4.  Beef chow fun:  The noodles were perfect.  This used to be one of my favorite dishes growing up and it's really easy to mess up if the noodles aren't the perfect texture and size.  Sun Wah's is really close to perfect. 5.  Stir-fried tofu medley:  I enjoyed this because I like tofu.  If you don't, I wouldn't order this. 6.  Roast pork:  I judge every Hong Kong-style BBQ place I go to based on the execution of this dish.  The meat should be flavorful but not dry, and the skin should be crispy and not chewy.  For the most part, Sun Wah does great. 7.  Peking duck:  The mini sandwiches came completely prepared already, which is understandable since this was a set dinner.  But the duck and the steamed buns got cold really quickly.  The Peking duck is normally AMAZING, and I would definitely suggest going to Sun Wah for its signature dish.  That being said, I still enjoyed it and the Matilda paired perfectly with the duck! 7.5:  Duck fried rice (made with the leftover Peking duck):  We weren't expecting this, but it's awesome that they don't let anything go to waste.   8.  Chicken with bittermelon in a black bean sauce:  I was not a fan of bittermelon when I was a kid and I am still not a fan of it.  What does it taste like?  Like a squash that has a bitter taste that somehow lingers even after you've swallowed it.  Sorry, but not my favorite. After the meal ended everyone was super stuffed and you could tell that the entire restaurant was considerably louder due to everyone being nicely liquored up from the beer.   Bravo Goose Island & Sun Wah BBQ!",0.9992,0.725,0.244,0.031,0.6483670329670329

I came here on Saturday night.  We had 6 people allowing us to order a bunch of food.   Crispy pork came out to start.  It was crispy, and tasty, but a little too tough.  Granted, we ate every last bite. Clams with black pepper sauce, and oysters with ginger and scallions, were the next items to wash up onto our table.  The clams were great, and I'd certainly order them again.  The oysters were fine, but a little boring to my non-Chinese palate.   Somehow the gailan (Chinese ""broccoli"") found its way to our table. It was done right, but if a Chinese restaurant can't figure this one out then you better find a new place. We had two duck combos.  One came with fried rice and the other with noodles.  The fried rice was boring.  The noodles tasted fine but were nothing special, but I count those as extras. Our ducks came out separately, and were carved table side.  They had the mandatory crispy skin, but they were cooked inconsistently.  I would say the first was cooked perfectly, but the second was overcooked to the point where a couple of pieces were bordering on what I'd consider burnt.  The second was also drier, but to this point we had already shared the entire first bird, so we were not too concerned about it.   The duck was served with weird steamed buns, unlike anything they'd ever serve with Beijing Kaoya in the Middle Kingdom.  This must be to fill up our fat bellies in the Beautiful Country.  The trouble with these bland rice flour buns is that they mask the subtle flavor in the duck skin that comes through better with the traditional paper-thin wraps.

My friend and i decided to eat at The Sun Wah later in the evening, and the place was mildly busy, which we took for a good sign, however, it was misleading. The service was mediocre, the food was ok, and the atmosphere reminded me of a large dining hall or a cafeteria. I could not help but overhear that the couple sitting next to us, who were there when Julien and i came in, had not even gotten their appetizer yet. I had finished my meal before they were brought theirs. The worst, i think, was when the staff started putting up the chairs and mopping the floors before anyone sitting near us had even had the chance to ask for a desert option. (not to say that i had any plans to do so, but our food was still on the tables.) Sun WahT were you thinking. Sorry.",-0.0204,0.85,0.084,0.066,0.5207792207792209

With a focus on roast meats (aka BBQ), this place is a welcome change from the usual Chinese. The Peking duck here is outstanding. No visit is complete without one. The roast chicken (soy sauce chicken) is out of this world and so is the roast pork, although get a larger portion of the latter or skip it as smaller orders just get you boney little chunks.  The beef chow fun, walnut shrimp, stir-fried Chinese broccoli with garlic, stir fried bok choys (both versions), and Chinese eggplant are all delicious as well.

The Peking duck was actually not all it is cracked up to be in taste, however the experience is cool.  They bring out an entire duck and cut it in front of you, so you know it is super fresh.  It comes with these super fluffy pieces of dough and sauce to make little wraps.  The duck was a little dry in my opinion and they leave the skin on.  I enjoyed the very similar duck dishes much more at Japonais and Tao, however it is WAY cheaper here.

Michael's Art & Crafts is down the street after all... anyway, back to how I earned my Ph.D. (Pleased by Having Duck).

Service was fast, but I do wonder if it was in part to my lady friend speaking the local lingo. Either way, I was impressed with how quickly everything came out and how attentive all the servers were. And it was a good thing they were quick, because we were hungry and the food was fantastic! The duck was not the greasy duck I was accustomed to eating. It was juicy and flavorful without being slimy. And the skin, oh the skin. So crisp and flavorful. It topped my duck and steamed bun perfectly. A couple times, actually. The noodles were the second best at the table, with the pork leaving a lot to the imagination. I suppose you can't win them all. Oh the soup! How could I forget the soup! Made from the bits from our duck, or maybe that table's duck over there... with broth and veggies, yumm-o! Perfect for a very snowy, cold and down right yucky Monday night.  Oh a side note, I was put to shame on a number of conversations, including not knowing an old guy who used to be in the ""pictures"" in the 1920's, and my pitiful culinary skills. You see, the wait staff's abilities to perfectly carve a duck in under two minutes brings out the Iron Chef in Sun Wah's more comestible-inclined diners. Men beating their chests at the prospect of going toe to toe in a contest of saffron-slinging, parsley-pureeing, and duck-confiting pride and glory. My table was no different.

2011-01-05,4.0,"I decided to ditch my family's Christmas day dinner this year and head out with a gaggle of duck hungry yelpers for a gathering at Sun Wah. That might sound a little odd but is two straight days of family mayhem really necessary? I think not.  I was expecting a Christmas Story scene at Sun Wah and surprisingly that was not the case at all. SW was hustling and bustling and seemed to be at maximum capacity. There was a short wait (even with a reso) but I didn't mind because after admiring the glorious roasted ducks in the window...I knew it would be worth the wait...and it was.  We were a table of about 10 or so and ordered two of the duck dinner which is served three ways - roasted & carved table side (what a treat!), ducked fried rice or noodles and souped. Since we we ordered two dinners...we got an order of a rice and noodles. We also ordered up some chinese broccoli for good measure. The carved duck was served with steamed buns, shredded veggies and hoison and in a word is DIVINE. The noodles were off the chain and the broccoli was surprisingly good.  SW is BYOB (corkage fees do apply, $5/wine $2/beer). We were well fed and therefore very very happy. The cost for this feast? EIGHTEEN DOLLAR including tip! Merry Christmas to us! I wouldn't hesitate to do Sun Way for Christmas dinner...Easter dinner...Thanksgiving...St. Patrick's...or for no other reason than just wanting a plate of the delicious skin from that glorious duck.

So that's exactly what we did. But being a special occasion, we had to call ahead for their two duck dinners. They use every part of the duck to make wraps, fried rice, soup, the works. When our party arrived, we looked over the menu for other entrees. We wound up ordering like seven other entrees, veggies to meats. We had all covered. Everything, and I mean everything, was awesome.

Pros:   Quick Seating - Waited 2 - 3 minutes and were taken to our table. Food Came out Fast / Large Amounts Many Menu Options - Combo Rice was awesome Seating Arrangements were great and can accomodate large parties Cons: Food was slightly bland.  I am not a huge fan of salt but a couple of pinches here and there added some needed flavor. Wait staff was not very friendly.  They know what they are doing process wise but miss the customer service aspect.   Overall good if you want Chinese food in the city and they were doing a brisk take out service if your an eat on the run type of person.

The front of the menu reads ""Hong Kong Style"" Chinese food, but there's nothing Hong Kong about the style. The food was horrible!!! We ordered a barbecue pork dish, the skin of the pork was so hard!! It was so difficult to eat. And then we ordered a vegetable dish, the vegetable was supposed to be stir fried with garlic and salt, if it's HK style, the dish would come out crisp with not too much sauce at the bottom of the plate. But the dish came out with lots of gravy like sauce, so the vegetable was soaked in the sauce which made it so soft and affected the texture of the vegetable.  We also ordered the peking duck due to numerous good reviews I read here, I'm sorry to say but the Phoenix restaurant in Chinatown makes this dish 10 times better than Sun Wah. If you haven't tried Phoenix in Chinatown, please try and compare.  They took the duck meat from the peking duck and made two more dishes -  a soup and fried rice. The soup was bland and tasted like salty water and the fried rice was cooked with too much moist. Basically, all the dishes I tried there were bad and NOT authentic HK style at all!!!

2010-12-19,5.0,"First off, the Peking duck here is outstanding. We just got back from a trip to Beijing where we had Peking duck at one of the top duck restaurants in the city at DaDong. The duck here at Sun Wah gives DaDong a run for its money. The duck here seems to be prepared 100% authentic, with very crispy skin, juicy meat, and roasted to perfection. Each bite was amazing. We had 5 people at our table and ordered one large duck and the was enough, although we did have 4 other dishes, soup and an appetizer. Keep in mind that when you order the whole duck, it also comes with a plate of buns, small plate of radish, scallion, and carrot slices, and duck fried rice and duck soup.  The other dishes we ordered were excellent in and of themselves...  Singapore rice noodles - Authentic and had a very nice spicy curry flavor and plenty of shrimp and scallions.  Mapo tofu - Flavorful bean sauce with plenty of minced pork, water chestnut and onions. The dish wasn't as spicy as I would have liked, but it went great with some white rice.  Soft shelled crab appetizer -I thought the batter they used was a bit too thick, however the crab was surprisingly large and they had cooked it perfectly...one thing I absolutely hate is overcooked soft shelled crab, but they were careful to retain the all subtle flavors of the crab meat at Sun Wah.   Hot and sour soup - Awesome. I think the way you can tell a good soup is by the texture/thickness. It can't be too watery, nor too thick. Sun Wah definitely got the thickness right and the spiciness was superb. A+ Duck fried rice - This was superb. Very light with plenty of beef and pieces of duck leftover from the duck carving. Not as much of the egg flavored fried rice, but not oily either. Very nice light and tasty fried rice. Duck soup - After the more intense flavors of the duck and other dishes, the soup seemed a bit bland to me, but I can imagine some people loving the subtle flavors of this soup. Overall, we had an awesome dinner at Sun Wah. We walked right in at 7pm on a Saturday night (albeit it was 16 degrees outside and the place is massive).

Pricing was $5 for a small, $8 or $9 for a medium I think, and can't remember the large.  We ordered a medium, and could barely finish this along with the rest of the food. As a note, we ordered the three items (duck dinner, butterfly shrimp, and BBQ pork) and ended up with leftover rice, soup, some duck, and a few pieces of pork (that we just couldn't finish).

Definitely worth checking out if you are craving chinese BBQ in Chicago!

2010-11-19,5.0,"Of course my mind would go to Sun Wah BBQ as I prepare to write my very first yelp review, ever.. it is, simply put, THE best Chinese restaurant you'll find in this extraordinary city. It's what you call, a ""gem"" in an otherwise sea of abject wannabes. You don't have to have grown up with daily East-Asian meals to know what I mean. When you have the hankering, how difficult is it to find really good bbq pork friend rice? -Or really good stir-fried noodles? It's darn near impossible to do, with all the corner food-to-go's replacing good old fashion sit-down restaurants that once served jasmine tea at the table and condiments not irritatingly sealed in impossible-to-open plastic packets. In a city that boasts an increasing number of award-winning restaurants, where does one go for a cheap eat that's worth the splurge, but doesn't require it??   In comes Sun Wah. The menu selections are seemingly endless, but accessible with the help of colorful depictions. Prices here are unbeatable.   Particularly notable is the peking duck dinner -comprised of a whole roasted duck, carved at the table and artistically served with warm sticky buns, spring onions, fresh carrots, and delicious hoisin sauce. It's served not once, but transformed into a second winter melon duck soup and a third duck friend rice.   If gluttony had a name, thou would'st be called ""Sun Wah!""  On several occasions, my boyfriend and I have attempted to tackle the entire meal between the two of us. It's no surprise, our attempts have always been to no avail. For anyone out there interested in a highly memorable culinary excursion, give Sun Wah a try -and don't be afraid to break out last year's pair of stretchy pants -you'll thank me for that later!

My only problem with Sun Wah is the service.  The few times I've been there, it is worst than any other restaurant service I've ever had, where we had to wait forever.  No other place would I tolerate a 2 - 2.5 hour meal waiting around.  If you are willing to put with subpar service, this place is worth eating at.",0.9702,0.732,0.211,0.057,0.5778309409888356
2010-11-15,3.0,"A place like this comes with a HUGE hype behind it. I have seen this show reviewed on TV before and it seems to be the talk of the town at times. We called the afternoon of a Saturday to try and get reservations for that evening. The host that answered the phone was playful and fun and said they were overbooked and can not take more reservations but she promised to have duck (which they are known for). She said she estimated a 30 minute wait time. We arrived to the restaurant about 7pm and it was packed, as expected, and we were told it would be a 1 hour wait for 11 people. After waiting a bit we decided to order from the to-go counter and take it back home with us. The restaurant is BYOB so we had some beers while we waited for our food. However, they charge $2/beer corkage fee and also a charge for wine. This seems pretty hefty for BYOB to me.  The wait for our to-go food was about 20 minutes after ordering until we all received our food. We decided to try a variety of dishes and share them amongst us. I ordered the BBQ Combination in an effort to try different meats. It had good flavor but the real drawback was the small bone pieces of different sizes that I would bit into. This really turned me off and the great taste of the meat couldn't fully be showcased.  We also tried a duck rice noodle dish that was fairly good but nothing I have to go back to try again. As I am a big fan of Thai food, I just feel that taste could not keep up and not much flavor was infused.  Overall it was a decent meal and the meat was good. The bones just ruined it for me and I would be better off getting a nice Thai meal closer to my house.

We had the Peking Duck (comes with the sliced duck & buns, rice, and soup), lobster, steamed clams, bbq pork, roasted pig, and steam chinese broccoli with oyster sauce. Tamia and Tia loved the bbq pork, duck and broccoli, so that was a big plus because they are finicky eaters. I loved everything we ate. You get to build your own nifty duck sandwich. They take what's leftover from the duck after carving it, and turns it into soup and fried rice. Nothing really stood us for us beside the Peking Duck. I guess the big plus for me is because it doesn't look so dingy inside as it does Hon-kee. Sun Wah is definitely worth trying. It's byob. Very inexpensive.

I tried to have lunch with a friend around noon. After some discussion about menu items a waiter took our order and read it back to us. We ordered 3 dishes - an appetizer, a noodle dish and a small roast pork. After 5 minutes, he brought a small bowl of roast pork like we had ordered and also a small bowl of roast duck (which we had asked questions about but ultimately had not ordered). We told him that we did not order the duck. He told us we ""had to"" take it. At first we thought it was a language barrier thing. So we sat for 5 minutes arguing back and forth that we had not ordered it and then he said he was going to check with a manager. It was so strange!  He went up to talk to a woman at the counter and then they had a waaaay too long conversation about it. There should not be a discussion at all -- we had not ordered the item, so take it away from the table and let's move on, right? Apparently not. He came back to the table to report that she too said we ""had to"" take it.  At this we put on our coats and went up to the front to pay for the tea we had consumed. We had not touched the food.  We had an odd conversation with the woman at the front desk he spoke to who did not really seem to understand the situation. We told her we just wanted to pay for the tea and leave and reiterated that we were not going to be strong-armed into paying for food we had not ordered.  She waved us off and said not to worry about the tea but she never apologized or tried to fix the situation.

Burger or a 3-course duck dinner where the skin gives bacon a run for its money? Hmm... 2. Great for groups.  Aside from the price and ability to share a whole roasted duck, it's BYOB and has seating for large parties in it's (relatively) new location. 3. Authentic. I just did my Peking Duck quest in its birthplace. After trying duck at a few places in Beijing, one being the fancier DaDong restaurant too (one of the top 3 peking duck spots, though disputed just as much as a restaurant would be for deep dish here in Chicago), Sun Wah still gets high marks for actual presentation and overall deliciousness when I compare it with the Chinese counterparts.  I actually thought Sun Wah's duck might be more moist and the skin more savory than the duck I had at DaDong.

As soon as we got here I knew exactly what I wanted, the roast pork.  I wanted that salty porky goodness along with the crispy skin of the pork inside me ASAP.  We also ordered barbequed pork as well as an order of shrimp gyoza soup.   I have to admit as soon as our order came out, I had to try to play it cool.  Because if I didn't I would have ravaged the food because it looked so good.  The roast pork with rice and greens was simplistic... exactly the way it should be.   With a little bit of saltiness and sauce dripping off the pork, it was definitely a spot that I hadn't hit in my appetite in a loooong time.  The barbequed pork was awesome as well.  This order came without rice but still a heaping portion of pork.  The sauce was great on it and my friend would say it was an even better choice than my roast pork.  Maybe that is true... maybe it isn't... you should go and try them both.  The shrimp gyoza soup was good as well.  The soup base was okay but the dumplings were some of the better ones I have had in Chicago so far.

Christopher was sweet enough to take me even though he does not eat duck.  When I saw the extensive menu I thought it would be a piece of cake to find some good food for Chris.

We tried to doctor it up with the abundant condiments on the table, but it really didn't help. The sweet and sour pork had a standard sauce, but the pork was extremely tough.  I, on the other hand, opted for variations on duck. I had the combo over rice. It was good, and portions here are certainly ample. I also had the duck and shrimp dumpling noodle soup.

2010-09-18,4.0,"I have now come here several times in the last year. Sun Wah has been around forever and actually recently moved to their current location from around the corner. Eating here is like eating in Chinatown without having to go to Chinatown. They specialize in their barbecue dishes, but have an array of other choices. FOOD: I have ordered everything from Fried Rice, to ""Something over rice"" dishes, and, of course, the barbecue. Everything I've had so far has been, for the most part, excellent. The Yang Chow fried rice is a personal favorite and I end up ordering it almost every time I go here. It contains a combination of meats, vegetables, and some egg. There isn't a whole lot of soy sauce, but that's the beauty of the dish..that it still comes out with such a good flavor. The barbecued duck has to be my most favorite of the barbecue dishes. There is an option to have it served alone or over white rice with a side of Chinese broccoli. Either way, you're in for a treat. What I like about this is that it is bursting with flavor. I check my shame at the door because when I have my duck here, I enjoy all of it =) SERVICE: The servers have been attentive and friendly lately. My glass of water has been kept full without me having to ask (which, by the way, is a HUGE indicator of service for me). Also, the food comes out extremely quickly...so if you come hungry, your food is just minutes away! APPEARANCE: Sun Wah's new location offers an open, clean, and modern look. The high ceilings with exposed beams are a nice touch and set this restaurant apart from the other Chinese restaurants in the Chicago area. I've never had to wait for seating here because there are just so many seats available. FINAL THOUGHTS: If you're looking for authentic-tasting Chinese cuisine, this is definitely a place you should check out.

We had to come up with a Plan B. FAST. Before I ate the faces off of everyone around me.  I remembered Sun Wah had reopened around the corner and even though we had dim sum just this morning, my Dude was kind enough to go with my suggestion of a second Chinese meal for the day.  I used to get takeout from the old Sun Wah when I first moved to Andersonville (good lord... was that really 12 years ago?!) and vaguely recall going there with the family when I was a kid. But I haven't been in in years and was curious about the new space.  It's really modern and open... so un-Chinese restaurant like! There are tons of tables so we were seated immediately.  So, now that I've read the reviews and watched the duck cart go around, I'm getting it next time. But tonight we went in uninformed so we just ordered a small hot and sour soup, duck/roast pork combo over rice and a small hi moon Mai fun.  The food came RIGHT away. Bless you, Sun Wah waitstaff.  The small hot and sour soup is more than enough for two people. It's fresh and hot. Yum.  The roast duck and pork and the Mai Fun arrived shortly there after. I liked the duck a lot but found some of the pork pieces to be UBER fatty. Now before I start getting hate mail, I'm aware that roast pork is supposed to be fatty, I've been eating it since I grew in my first teeth. But this was pretty fatty tonight. It happens so I'm not gonna hold it against Sun Wah. My favorite part about the roast pork/duck plate was that it was served with half a salted egg. I could seriously eat salted egg and rice all day long so I was jazzed.  The Mai Fun was also delicious. My grandma's Chinese restaurant had a dish pretty similar to this back in the day that I've had badly done elsewhere... and this was just as good as Grandma made. Well... as good as her chefs made anyways.  We were stuffed and had leftovers... and our bill was $17.00 exactly. My Dude remarked ""Sh*t, this is almost cheaper than grocery shopping and making our own meals!"". No kidding!  We had ZERO issues with service. They were really attentive, we always had water and when we realized our meter was almost up and we had to hustle outta there, the waitstaff got our check to us quickly and boxed up our leftovers in a flash.  We will most certainly be back!

The new Sun Wah has moved into grander digs around the corner on Broadway, and its borderline upscale space is about 4 or 5 times bigger than the original. Many of the old-school staff is still there, but since the place is bigger there is also some newer staff. The menu is a heavy document with a bit of their history printed in it.  While I do like to order the chow mein to go, I talked my friend into dining on the Peking duck recently. For only $35 this duck-licious meal is designed for 4 persons, though I think ideally this would feed three (since there were only two of us we had a decent amount of leftovers). If you are not sure about ordering, take a look around - there is bound to be another table ordering Peking duck. The duck is served and carved tableside, along with delicate veggie sides, the spongy white breading that is used for steamed BBQ pork buns, and the duck sauce. While feasting on the duck, the carcass is then used to produce duck soup and then duck fried rice. The soup is OK with lots of bones so you know it's the real deal, and the duck fried rice is good, but the main duck course is lights-out delicious. We then had a tiny dollop of ginger-like ice cream for dessert along with fortune cookies. Peking duck at Sun Wah - just do it!",0.9816,0.878,0.113,0.009,0.5797870004391744

2010-09-04,4.0,"I said it a few times already, and I will say it again: when you have a Yanyao in your life, life is good. And you won't ever go starving. Ms Nom-Nom had promised me a duck way back in the Spring  to celebrate my birthday. She stayed true to her word. Back from her foodie marathon across the country in lovely San Francisco where she admittedly left her heart like all of us (and probably our flat stomachs and overall good figures too), she called Sun Wah, reserved a duck (poor little thing) and soon enough we were on our way in the first cool day of the summer to indulge. Tip #1: if you are not a fan of crowds and are brave enough to have dinner at 4pm - this is definitely the time to go. The place was EMPTY. We perused the huge, double-sided menu, just for fun and decided to add to our order bbq pork and water spinach (so.....kinda like broccoli rabe but thinner and the stem has a hole in the middle. Delicious). What can I add to all that has been said already?!?!? This Peking/Beijing duck is just ridiculously good. Carved table side, it is a marvel with the warm, sticky buns, the julienned carrots and green onions, the pickled daikon and the hoisin sauce. And don't skip on the crispy skin. This is the BEST PART BY FAR. So effing good. Tip #2: ask for the noodles instead of the fried rice, and stay firm about it. Served with duck meat, carrots, pea pods, mushrooms and onions it is out of this world. And dudes, don't let the service bother you. Your waiter/waitress may not speak perfect English, he/she may be slow and not overtly nice but seriously who cares?!? You are not coming for the service but the food. Eat and be happy.

Based on Yelper insights we considered other dishes to sample more items, but our server told us the duck would be plenty. Given that there were only two of us and we and our potential leftovers would be heading to the Green Mill before going home, it was the right decision to just stick with the duck. It was as incredible as everyone else said. The fat was perfectly rendered, the skin crispy without being burnt or chewy, and the meat silky. Also loved the bao instead of the more-familiar-in-Chicago pancake. As for the service: we encountered none of the problems described by other reviewers. I think it helped that our reservation was early, at 6:30, and we arrived and they seated us even earlier. Given that we didn't order apps, our entree (the aforementioned duck) didn't take any longer to arrive than it would have anywhere else. Just enough time to have a nice conversation with my husband (yep, we do that) over a Tsing Tao for him and a sauvignon blanc for me.

After watching our duck get carved at the table, we stuffed medallions of barbecued duck in little bao wrappers and filled them with carrots and hoisin.  We then slurped our duck soup, which tasted more than anything like those little bowls of broth you get with Korean BBQ, and finished it off with duck fried rice. The first course was the best, I think, with each subsequent one being a little blander (which makes sense given they're scraping less meat off the duck with each course).  Since they cooked the duck so perfectly, it was easy to stuff mouthfuls of meat into my mouth without worrying about it being tough and degenerating into an unchewable mouthful.  The soup was clear and refreshing, but dangerous with lots of little bones.  By the time the duck became fried rice, it was kind of oily and bland.  I would rather have had it made into congee, personally - congee makes even the scarcest amounts of meat delicious! When the onslaught was all over, we were given little bowls of mystery ice cream that, if I had to take a stab at it, may have been mangosteen and anise flavored.  No one liked it but me so I got to eat three bowls.  Yay!",0.9856,0.794,0.144,0.062,0.5712719298245614

For people who have moderate appetites, it can be good for 2 meals. But of course for me, why go over the trouble of bringing home a doggy bag when you can eat your nice meal right there.  A lot of people can get mesmerized by the fancy dishes in this place, such as the $30 duck platter. Trust me, go for the $5 duck over rice, its the same duck which is a generous portion for one and you save more :)  If you're in the mood for some soup, the shrimp wonton soup is absolutely the bomb! Generous sized wontons filled with ground pork and a nice plump shrimp is served over noodles and a tasty broth. And yes, its less than $5.   O yeah! before I forget, don't forget they sell their bbq/ roasted goodies to go! (Plus its a few bucks cheaper than the dine-in menu) this is a good place to grab a quick take out for company at home. My absolute favorite will always be the roast pork and duck!",0.9969,0.769,0.207,0.024,0.6150396825396826
2010-06-26,5.0,"I live 2 blocks away from here and this is probably hands down my favorite place in the Argyle Street area. The duck is a must have.  I can usually split 1 duck with 3 other people because they give you so much with it, though if you are really, really hungry you could probably split one with another person.  They carve the duck at your table and then take the carcass into the kitchen and make soup with it.  They give you dumplings to eat with the duck and you also have your choice of fried rice or noodles.  If you want veggies you have to order that separately but everything is so reasonably priced for what you get.  The skin is just so crispy and well seasoned and flavorful. I'm making myself hungry now.",0.5567,0.934,0.046,0.019,0.4070987654320988

I remember their old place being... ech let's not talk about it. This new place is very large and open and clean (which, frankly, is hard to find in most Chinatowns).  The service might not be SUPERB, but you can't expect too much. We got all our things in order eventually with a bit of flagging down two waiters, and our food came really fast. But then again... it was Monday noontime. I like ordering the plates over rice. The portions are good enough for two people, they're plated very simply, and they're very satisfying (and cheap!). My mom ordered the fish and tofu over rice and it was melt-in-your-mouth happiness. I ordered the beef curry, and the flavors were fantastic. This place isn't over-Americanized and for the flavors and price, I highly recommend it. Don't go sweet and sour, orange chicken, blah blah anything. Be adventurous!

The flavors of the steamed fish and scallions was right on. #2) Soft shell crab, pretty good - its a blue crab during molting stage battered and fried. Served with wok seared peppers and onions. #3) Fish ball soup with watercress. The fish balls are home made ( non-freezer kind) and broth made from bone vs bullion.

2010-06-04,4.0,"I'm just going go ahead and say that if I want good (I'm talking mind blowing Asian food) Chicago wouldn't be my first stop. Aside from the countries themselves, you'll get the best Asian food on the west coast. There I said it. I mean find a person that will tell you that you'll find better sushi in Chicago than you will in LA or better Chinese in Chicago than you'll find in San Francisco's Chinatown. I highly doubt that you'll find someone.  With that said, basing everything just in the state of Illinois, Sun Wah Bar-B-Que reminds me of the Chinese restaurants I grew up going to in Vancouver's Chinatown. First and foremost, the bbq duck, chickens, etc hanging in the front window of the restaurant is how all good Chinese restaurants should be. Either that or they have a giant fish tank with lobsters, catfish or crabs in the front. Either way, I take one of two things to be a sign that a Chinese restaurant will be good.  The menu had every one of my favorite childhood dishes like salted fish fried rice, pan friend noodles (extra crispy of course), white fish with black bean sauce and more importantly roasted duck that is served as multiple courses. Based on reviews, I definitely didn't want to go and not try the duck. I ordered the roasted duck and bbq pork over rice and it was everything I dreamed of in Chinese food. My husband ordered the duck over pan fried noodles and it reminded me of Hong Kong style chow mein with the outer noodles so crisp and the center noodles drenched in the amazing sauce that covers mixed veggies, as well as your choice of meat. But the best part of it all was that not only were the portions well beyond an individual serving size (and my husband ordered a small), but the menu items were SO amazingly cheap. My huge heaping pile of food was only $4.50 and the small pan friend noodles, which covered the entire dinner size plate from edge to edge, was only $5.00. The 2 entrees, one appetizer and my Tsing Tao beer the grand total with tax came to.....$19.05!  I was truly amazed/impressed. The service was great, and I was expecting it to be bad based on reviews, the food was delicious and the individual servings are big enough to take left overs home. All in all, I finally found a good Chinese place in Chicago that didn't feel Americanized or a glorified version of Panda Express....More importantly, I finally found a place that didn't rely on orange chicken to be on their signature item.",0.9951,0.834,0.149,0.017,0.4932561728395062

I've avoided eating you for years and years because - well, you're cute and I couldn't stand the thought of someone cooking you up and hacking away at you. Nevertheless, I was tempted to try you at Sun Wah back in February, I craved you ever since, and finally I can now say without a doubt: I WANT TO EAT YOU, YOUR FRIENDS, AND YOUR FAMILY - but only if the masterminds at Sun Wah prepare you.  Sun Wah deserves five stars just for their delectable duck, however, as many reviewers have already mentioned, their service is terrible. My family and I went on Mother's Day, so there is room for leniency considering that the restaurant was much busier than usual - but seriously, the service shouldn't have been this bad. The waitress seemed annoyed while we were taking our order and asking questions, it took us three times of asking three different people for glasses of water (which didn't come till we were about halfway done with our meal), and it was absolutely impossible to get our waitress' attention (or anyone else who looked like they could help).  Complaints aside, Sun Wah has great food.Tonight we ordered fried oysters,black bean mushroom tofu,  wonton soup, and the duck meal.The oysters and tofu were both flavorful and cooked to perfection and the wonton soup was actually comparable to Honkee's on Argyle (which I think has the best bowl of wonton soup in the city). The only thing I have to say is that the broth was a bit too salty and there wasn't enough shrimp in the wonton. On our last visit, we ordered their clam in black bean sauce and their shrimp in lobster sauce which were also rather delicious.  Now on to the star of the show. The second that cart came strolling down our way and I saw that  beautiful steaming bird ready to be sliced into delicious pieces, my mouth watered with excitement. There's something about the combination of succulent duck, hot buns, pickled radish, scallions, and hoisen sauce that sends my taste-buds in a frenzy. When delicious food is in my mouth, it's like my taste-buds hit the play button on my mind's radio and I can't help but dance.

I believe this restaurant is simply trying to sell the fact that the duck chef went to China for training, but after a brief conversation with her, I learned that she wasn't really trained and ""learned"" by watching people do it at restaurants. It's decent food, no doubt.  But I feel there are far better Peking ducks in the city.  Traditionally, the duck is served with pancakes but their buns were tasty and fit the bill as well.  I liked the fact that they're freshly steamed.

2010-04-21,4.0,"Here is an updated edition after trying dinner at SunWah. I have added one star because the Peking duck did not disappoint. The good: The Peking duck was good. Not excellent if you compare it with HK, Beijing but let's face it. We are in Chicago, the wilderness of Chinese cuisine.  The buns (served with the duck) were soft, moist and warm. The not-so-good: The assortment BBQ plate disappointed.  I want to stress that their Cantonese roasts should be quite good. It is just that diners should order individual items (siu-yuk or roasted whole pig skin-on, char-siu, duck or chicken) rather than the assortment. The assortment dish served us consisted of char-siu, soy-sauce-chicken and roast duck. I had thought it would certainly have siu-yuk in it but disappointingly, no. The meats were not the best cuts and worst of all, the presentation was awful. The plate was too small. The meats were just put on the dish without any thought as to esthetic or culinary consideration (the meats should not be piled on such that the sauces and juices of each mix). It (the presentation) would be acceptable in SunWah's previous location but SunWah is now a serious sit-down restaurant, not a hole-in-the-wall Cantonese roasts joint that just sells take-out meats. We ordered other dishes: fried oyster, pan-fried Chilean sea-bass(expensive but well executed), fried soft-shell crab (inexpensive at 4.50 each and pretty good), beef and bitter gourd and others. On the whole, the dishes (besides the Peking duck) were average, nothing to write home about or to recommend in particular. My recommendations: 1. Peking duck. 2. Order individual cantonese roasts and do not order the assortment dish. Previous review: The Trib did 3 articles on SunWah in the past few months. That certainly created a lot of attention for them.  Because of this I would like to review it in some detail.  I have never dined in their old location but had been a regular customer buying Cantonese roast products (often referred o as Cantonese BBQ) until about 3 or 4 years ago. It wasnt because there was anything wrong with their foods but I just stopped going to the Argyle area after our favorite Pho joint changed ownership. The recent Trib articles made me decide to go back to SunWah.  The Peking duck review will have to wait as I made a reservation for later this month with a group of friends. This past weekend my wife and I tried lunch there.  The good:  1.The roast whole pig (the skin-on kind, known as siu-yuk, not to be confused with char-siu, the roast pork without skin) was good.  2. The soy sauce chicken was also quite good although not outstanding.  One of the ""choppers"" ( the guys who select your BBQ cut and chop it up for you) still recognized me as a former regular customer and greeted me warmly. That was a nice touch.  The bad:  1. The char-siu was sub-par. Wonton Express at Milwaukee/Deerfield easily beats SunWah at least on this occasion. I was quite disappointed because SunWah made pretty good char-siu in the past. The cut I got ( I am sure the chopper who recognized me did his best to find me a decent piece of meat) was dry and therefore a little chewy. Being a specialty Cantonese BBQ joint, Sun Wah should really make sure their char-siu is up to quality.  2. Forget about their wonton. (Again Wonton Express makes better and more authentic wonton.) SunWah's wonton stuffing seemed to be all meat. Authentic Canton/HongKong wonton should contain some chopped shrimp. The texture of the stuffing was also too firm. They were like meatballs in a wonton wrapping.  3. The ho-fun (flat rice noodle) in soup was not cut into thin strips as they should be. We ordered this with the wonton. When ho-fun is served in soup, they should be cut into 1/4 inch wide strips. The wider strips should be used in fried ho-fan.  4. Fish ball was not authentic. It was our mistake to order this in the first place. Outside of Hong Kong we have yet to find the Chiu Chow fish ball that is so unique in its taste and texture. Not even in NYC, SF or Toronto.  We will be trying SunWah's Peking duck soon. Will post a review then. It is quite remarkable that they actually went to Beijing to learn the preparation of Peking duck.

Food = love. Anyway, one of my friends turned a year older and I promised him duck to celebrate. We ended up ordering a Beijing duck and then I got a little too excited and added on: crispy skin roast pork, soy sauce chicken, bbq spare ribs, egg rolls, garlic pea shoots, stir fried lotus root. This, plus a duck soup and fried rice, is a lot of food for 4 people... but since Chinese celebrations always involve large extravagant meals, I felt this was appropriate. :) Everything we had was wonderful. - This is a Chinese BBQ place so you can't go wrong with any of the items. The soy sauce chicken is one of my favorites, my friend said the spare rib was one of the best ribs he's ever had, and crispy pork skin? Do we even need to discuss this? - Egg rolls deemed by egg roll expert Mr. N to be the best he has ever had. - Garlic pea shoots because you need to eat your greens. Don't worry, they go down real easy.  - The stir fried lotus root dish blew my mind. Vegetarians be warned, there is BACON in it. And snow peas. And wood ear mushrooms.  - The duck itself is pretty much the same thing that you would get in Beijing. (Believe me, I eat about 10 ducks by myself every time I go home). The only difference is they serve it with soft, warm buns instead of the thin pancake. Fine by me. The buns are more filling away.  So, yeah, this was a fantastic birthday meal. Stuffed to the brim, leftovers galore, perfect. 5 stars now because somehow it has managed to remind me of two places when I am homesick: Beijing and Hong Kong, and successfully too! What a feat. Bravo Sun Wah! Some tips: - They are now in a much bigger space than before, on Broadway. - Don't be fooled into thinking you can just waltz in and get a table though. The word is out about this $32 duck. This place is PACKED on weekends with most tables eating duck. Call ahead and make reservations and order your duck.

2010-03-28,1.0,"Sun Wah has always held a special place in both my heart and my childhood. A few of my distinct memories from growing up includes trips to New Chinatown (i.e. Little Saigon) with my Mom. Making pilgrimages out to Viet Hoa for groceries, and then stopping by Sun Wah on our drive back into the suburbs to ensure that our BBQ purchases would still be piping hot by the time we ventured back home. Granted this was back in the day when the restaurant/BBQ joint was no larger than a grounded double-wide trailer. Where when you first walked in you were engulfed with the chaos that were Asian men and women calling out their BBQ orders, all vying for the choicest and freshest bits in the ""butcher/BBQ"" portion of their place. All the while as they all trampled upon cut open cardboard boxes that served as ""floor mats"" in a crammed little space which resembled a hallway where the only thing that separated you from a gluttonous haven filled with hanging ducks and pigs was their stainless steel counter. It was dirty. It was dingy. It was chaotic. The food was delightful. Now let us fast forward to their new location, chefs and owners. The new restaurant off of Broadway is easily 5 times as large of a space. My family and I went for lunch on a weekday to celebrate my birthday. None of us had been to New Chinatown in years and we wanted to see what it had developed into. The restaurant was much more open, with the skylight taking full advantage of the sunny day. It was aesthetically appealing with the exposed brick walls and dividers. It still had the traditional ducks lined up in front of the window, and I appreciated how it had not gone completely modern and commercial. We were seated immediately and in a matter of moments a waiter was there taking our order. My mom ordered in Cantonese, which may have returned us with better service, (our water glasses and tea pot never ran empty for longer than 2 minutes -- contrary to many other posters and their gripes) and even then I give it a 1 out of 5.  Chinese food is meant to be devoured family style, which is why they bring out plates of food as soon as they have been prepared, as opposed to the American way of ""each person orders their own plate"". Obviously the BBQ food came out first. We had Roast Pork and Spareribs. The roast pork was over cooked and extremely salty and tough in some places - a far cry from the moist and succulent pork that their namesake would create. The Spareribs were meatier than BBQ King House, yet the flavor bland and did not penetrate the meat quite as well as their competitor.  We also ordered Beef with Bok Choy, Tofu stuffed with shrimp, Chow Mein, House Fried Rice, Sweet and Sour Pork, a special squid dish as well as a few other dishes.  Everything was under seasoned and borderline bland. The Noodles in the Chow Mein were literally burnt, as if they had been scorched - destroying the flavor of the dish. The Fried Rice was bland and tasteless, and the squid was actually undercooked.  My mom and my grandma still went out of their way to order more BBQ to bring home to eat for the week. My Mom ordered half a duck and the next day found that it was inedible. There wasn't any meat, and what was there was dry and tasted strange.  It was an incredibly disappointing experience. My only wish was that I could have left my childhood memories where they were, in happy times reliving family moments at Sun Wah. I do not recommend this place and wish that I could give them negative stars. It was a waste of a birthday lunch and quality family time that I could have happily spent somewhere else.",0.9544,0.857,0.086,0.057,0.4562801484230056

Get a reservation, this place is super busy on the weekends- and reserve a duck. 1 duck for 3-4 people is perfect. its 33 bucks and well worth it. Start off with the egg rolls- I know it is cliche, but do it anyways. I don't know what made them so tasty but it doesn't matter. Mix the sweet and sour sauce and the hot mustard on the table that dip them in it.  While you are waiting for the duck- order some BBQ pork. It was kinda sweet, not dry at all and perfect to snack on while waiting for the duck deliciousness to come out. And you will wait. As with many Asian places- the service is terrible. You will wait forever to get drinks, so do yourself a favor and drink Kirin beer here as they come in extra large bottles. The duck is great- they carve it right at the table, so just be aware of that if you have squeamish friends. They put it all out on a platter and give you fixins/sauces to make sandwiches with. All super tasty. And we had a Mexican guy carving our duck. Mexican guy carving Peking duck is exactly the reason I love Chicago. Then they bring out duck soup. It is really more of a broth, but still good. I didn't expect to finish my bowl but I did.  After the soup comes DUCK FRIED RICE. Seriously, the duck fried rice was amazing. Maybe it was all the Kirin beer in me, but it was so good.  Definitely a good time and great for big groups. They have a few 10 person tables complete with lazy susans.

The venture to Chinatown is about an hour or so by El, so lucky for them, we decided to try it at Sun Wah. During our first visit, like many other Chinese restaurants, we didn't expect service to be superb, but at least somewhat okay. And it was just ""meh"". Not fast, not slow, just okay. The Peking Duck was carved right in front of our eyes. Very nicely carved and then all of our other dishes came out. The Peking Duck was eh...average. I've definitely tasted better in Chinatown. And on top of that, they gave us FREAKING 6 buns. One whole duck and just 6 buns. I had to literally rip each bun in 4ths just to eat a portion of the duck....and when I asked for more, they ended up charging me $3 for it. UNNECESSARY MUCH?! I mean, I don't mind paying for good food, but when it's just insanely not that great, I will have a problem with it. The duck bone soup was actually pretty good. The other dish that came with, was just okay. Nothing out of the ordinary. And I'm guessing they forgot our third dish? But it was okay, we decided to give them another chance and another visit. Our second visit, it was understandable that it was a really busy Saturday night, but our waiter was super rude and just zipped past us like there was no tomorrow! We wanted to get the Peking duck again since I was craving it...but surprisingly the waiter dissuaded us. He said that it would take 45 minutes for it since they had a lot of parties. We said we were willing to wait. but he simply refused to let us order it. We found that a bit weird so we asked for him to give us a few minutes while we chose another dish. He flatly said NO. My only expression was WTH!? NO?? Come again?! And then he stood there as we awkwardly as we decided what to eat. We ended up ordering two fish dishes..one was white fish and the other as sea bass. They were both very, very good. That's my 1 star. But my experience destroyed the rest. Oh and this one time, the waiter swung by our table, asked us something REALLY REALLY FAST, and before we could up and even answer, he ran off with one of the sauces from our table. I even caught it on VIDEO! LOL. That was super awkward. So yeh, we won't be venturing out to this place even if it as right next to our building! Our trip to Chinatown must continue on....

This place is called Sun Wah Bar-B-Que, but it can hardly live up with any Bar-B-Que standard, in my opinion.  The BBQ roast pork was too lean and dry, this is because they weren't using the right kind of cut, the pork butt to make the BBQ roast pork; instead they substitute it with a cheaper cut of meat.  Then come the roast pork, dry and tough with no flavour whatsoever. Aside from having the (2) Peking Ducks for dinner, we also ordered other dishes, sadly they were basically cooked like ****ing Chop Suey!!!  Maybe we have forgotten to ask the waitress to inform the cooks that we are real Chinese diners.   Let me begin with the two vegetable dishes, stir fry Chinese broccoli and stir fry baby Pak Choy, which both can be tasted with burnt wok aroma and were soaked heavily in gravy.  Tell you he truth, stir fry is never meant to be having excess gravy and cooking dishes with a burnt wok is just dead ***ing wrong!!! The Beef and Chinese broccoli chow fun (wide flat noodles) was simply ****ing Chop Suey style. A steamed Sole, OK but nothing excited about it. Now, here comes the Peking Ducks.  Firstly, they were inadequately seasoned and hence tasted bland.  Secondly, Peking Duck is served with steamed buns, so that you can wrap the crunchy duck skin and meat inside to eat.  The duck is a good size bird, yet they only provide you with (6) steamed buns to every Peking Duck order.  So, the end result was a lot of duck meat left but no buns to eat with!!! Then come the dishes that were included in the Peking Duck dinner, a soup made from the duck carcass and a stir fry noodles and fried rice made with the leftover meat from the duck carcass.  The soup tasted just like boiled saline water. The stir fry noodles and fried rice were both extremely salty, and they looked and tasted exactly what you would get from an Americanised Chinese restaurant, ****ing Choy Suey style!!! The noodles was cooked just like Chow Mien and the fried rice was cooked with ****ing soy sauce!!!  Again, we must have forgotten to ask the waitress to let the cooks know that we are real Chinese diners!!! The only saving grace from tonight's dinner was having family and good friends as company. So, there you have it, after my second time with this place, I don't think I would be back anytime soon.  But, if you're looking for Chop Suey style Chinese food, Sun Wah Bar-B-Que is your ****ing pot of gold!",0.7171,0.861,0.073,0.066,0.41724257884972177

2010-02-21,1.0,"COMEDY OF ERRORS.  First of all, we went to Sun Wah when it was in its original location and thoroughly enjoyed the duck and the service. We recommended the place to numerous friends and were looking forward to our next trip.  We were extremely disappointed with our last visit.  In most restaurants-- including dives-- there are some basic elements we all have come to expect: namely, some semblance of organization. At Sun Wah, it was chaos. We showed up for our 8PM reservation and here is what we saw: hoards of confused people crowding the doorway, no apparent host or manager escorting people to tables or taking names, open tables waiting to be cleared for 10 minutes at a time, and numerous parties waiting either for their food or for their check. When we thought we found the ""host"" and inquired about our reservation, he told us to ""talk to the guy in white,"" of which there were three or four workers fitting that description scattered across the restaurant.  It turned out that the ""guy in white"" we needed to speak to was also filling in as a bus boy, kitchen manager, server, and cashier. When we finally got his attention, we realized that their reservations record and walk-in management system consisted of a checklist written on the back of a scrap of cardboard. After standing there for another 20 minutes, despite our reservation, we were finally taken to a table that had not been cleared or cleaned; we were still grateful given the 30 people still standing by the doorway. Things did not improve from here. After 20 minutes of sitting unattended, we flagged down three people and finally had a server bring us water and uncork our wine. We again tried to make it clear that we had called in advance for the duck, and the waitress seemed boggled. Around 8:55PM, nearly an hour after our reservation, our ""man in white"" came by to assure us that we were ""second in line for duck."" When we asked what that meant, he became  hostile and defensive, telling us that there were 8 parties behind us and that we should be grateful that we were getting duck-- or his generous update-- at all.  Five minutes later, we flagged down a woman we knew from our previous visit to be an owner.  Our intent was to ask how long it would be until we would get our food. She clarified that ""second in line"" meant 25-30 minutes. Her tone was rude and defensive. She made a big fuss about how ""everybody in the restaurant wants duck tonight"" and ""we don't have enough people to cut it."" Sorry, but you're surprised everyone wants duck? That's the sole reason anybody comes here. Incredible nerve. We left at 9:15PM, cutting our losses, and went across the street to Tank Noodles for a prompt, wonderful dinner.  Unless you have three hours to kill and endless patience, don't go to Sun Wah.",-0.0395,0.876,0.067,0.058,0.431881313131313

2010-02-14,5.0,"It was a treat coming here for our first meal (feast might be more accurate) of the Chinese New Year, courtesy of our nephew.  I can't imagine a better Peking Duck, and for reference, I've had it in Beijing, at the famous place by the Emperor's Summer Palace (I had to look it up out of curiosity - Quan Jude).  Sun Wah's new location on Broadway is really nice for an authentic Chinese place - spacious, clean, comfortable with big tables, and with maybe the largest dining room in either of our two Chinatowns.  Dining room has a modern loft feel to it with exposed brick walls and ductwork.   BBQ chicken was also uniquely tasty - with deeply marinated BBQ flavor and crispy skin, and juicy white meat underneath.  The highlight though was the duck, which was expertly carved tableside by Kelly, the senior sibling co-owner of Sun Wah.  The crispy skin slices were expertly thin with meat attached, making for a lot of duck portions for our buns.  I only know her name is Kelly because of the Tribune's timely article on the place this week.  I'm assuming I won't be fined by Yelp for posting this third party link: chicagotribune.com/enter… Ok, service was a litle slow on the duck, but the place was packed, and I think you have to factor in the value aspect, which was excellent as we had several other excellent courses as well.  So overall, I think the value offset the little slower service on a packed New Year's Day Sunday, so I still go with 5 stars. We'll defiinitely be back.   This place is another example (like Chi Cafe in old Chinatown) of how Chicago Chinatown dining is rapidly changing for the better with the times.     ps - Besides street parking, and at least on the weekends, there are a couple of narrow parking lots nearby on Broadway you can pull into (sign is labeled employee and visitor parking).",0.9771,0.88,0.102,0.018,0.4848695286195286

2010-02-11,4.0,"Duck... duck... duck... GOOSE! Wait, no, I mean DUCK! Ok, I've noticed a theme in all these Sun Wah reviews, but honestly, you gotta call a spade a spade. From beginning to end, this place is all about the duck. We were first intrigued after driving by the storefront day after day and seeing the glistening ducks roasting in the front window. Thanks to a couple glowing Yelp reviews, we made our way to Sun Wah on a chilly Friday night to check it out for ourselves. We looked past the ""Corporate Offices"" signboard and made our way into this sprawling, exposed-brick location. Having the glass-walled kitchen in the front was a treat and we licked our lips as we read the chalkboard specials: duck, roast pig, lobster, crab. Amazing. After being sat, we sipped on $3 Tsing Taos (awesome) and wandered through the extensive menu, never really pulling our eyes away from the roast duck. We finally ordered some wontons, fried rice and other tasty side dishes to complement our 'medium' roast duck. We tried to order a couple ""small""soups but our waiter looked frozen when we ordered two - and with good reason. A ""small"" soup filled each of our bowls three times over. Thanks to him for correcting our egregious mistake. A word of warning, you don't really order in courses here. You just order what you want and it comes out when it is ready. The first thing to arrive at our table was actually the duck - precut and glistening. We tried to wait for the accoutrement to arrive, but no doing - we had to dive in. And it was delicious. Fatty and crispy and flavorful. The other items arrived and everything was far better than your usual Chinese takeout, but nothing, NOTHING, really upstaged the duck. We realized that if you order the 'large' duck, that they bring the whole bird to your table and butcher it for you. We plan on doing so when we have more bellies to fill in the future. Overall, the food is delicious, the prices are more than fair, the service is somewhat slow and infrequent (but who cares when you have a pile of delicious waterfowl in front of you) and the duck is the best I've ever had.

2010-01-26,4.0,"Once upon a time Sun Wah Bar-B-Que was located on Argyle. I remember telling my friends when I was younger that this was a place with some plexiglass up because they would chop roasted duck or pig with such force that hunks of meat would go flying in every direction. That Sun Wah while dingy served up some of Uptown's best eats. We have always gotten roasted pig and duck from Sun Wah. As the years passed friends kept ranting and raving about Sun Wah and how awesome it was. Yes, I knew where Sun Wah was but the truth was I never remembered what it was called! Fast forward to the present day where I heard of the NEW Sun-Wah. I recall walking past while on my way to Viet Hoa to pick up rice hats for kickball and seeing it in construction and reading review after review pop in. Time passes and opportunity finally landed in my hands and a friend was hungry, hungry enough to go to Uptown and rock some Sun Wah! Wahhhhooooo!!! We came in and were stunned with the visuals, bright lights up above, brick wall, huge, huge clean locale with the traditional plexiglass still up to protect passerbys from flying projectiles of meat! We sat down my buddy ordered some Goose Island while I had some pop. I got some garlic chicken while my friend battened down on some shrimp tofu. While he did not know what he was ordering and confused it with some other dish, there was no confusion about mine: delicious, delicious, and YUM! While dining I became quite jealous of the other tables with duck being carved out in front of them. Resolved to go again, I did!

2010-01-15,3.0,"Everyone has heard the myth about the magic duck.  You know, the duck that with its throbbing flavor and juicy succulence can turn even the militant vegetarian into a meat eater. It just makes herbivores want to wrap their mouth around it and then put it inside of them - giving up their culture in the process (no more waving those broccoli colored flags!).  Well, this duck actually exists and it's at Sun Wah. Yes, I couldn't help but indulge in a *small piece* of duck as a group of us gathered on Christmas day. And, while I still prefer the company of a good veggie (maybe a carrot), it was the best thing I've tasted in a while. I salved my guilt of indulging in the flesh by the fact that Sun Wah doesn't waste an iota of the animal. After a brilliant display of knife wielding by a chef at the table to come up with a plate of wings and thighs, the meat closer to the bone is taken back to the kitchen and made into soup and fried rice. To see the look of glee on my meat eating companion's eyes as they ducked in was both scary and warm holiday glowy!  The orgy of duck is actually very decently priced, as was my dish for the evening - Lo Mein with ginger and scallions (which is apparently a native dish to Hong Kong). I was surprised by the amount of spice it contained though. It was one of the few vegetarian dishes on the menu (and just a warning, many of the ones that appear vegetarian contain fish sauce) but it was filling and just $4.00!  And pretty good so it fulfilled the old saying, ""good things come to those who wait."" And wait we did. I understand that it was a holiday and packed (as one of the few things open) but our server would disappear for 20-30 minutes at a time. Waters would not get refilled and the dishes for those who didn't get duck would trickle in one by one. In short, and I know this isn't in the Christmas spirit of that day, the service sucked! And I've heard this lack of attention isn't limited to the holiday season.  I mean, if they really want to convert me to the ways of the meat eater, they need to work on that. Wait.

Just as our stomachs were about to be heard over our conversations, the ducks finally arrived. They were a sight to behold. Our server went to town carving him up while we all eyed the plate greedily. Luckily, I was sitting on the end of the table with some figure conscious diners. That meant that I had pretty much all the wonderful, crunchy duck skin my little heart desired. Seriously, when I stuffed my bread with the carrots, daikon, green onion and plum sauce - the meat to skin ration was fifty fifty for sure. Yum! Since we ordered two ducks we tried the duck fried rice and the duck lo mein. Trust me, lo mein is absolutely the way to go. The soup wasn't my favorite - but soup isn't really my thing in the first place. We also did some veggie plates to share. The baby bok choy and the chinese broccoli in garlic sauce were scrumptious as well.  Now for the bad. The ladies bathroom was pretty icky. There was quite a bit of water coming up from the sewer. Heard it was the same for the men's room. Also, some of the diners with us came across some not so clean utensils. Also pretty icky - but at least it didn't happen to me :p  I was going to say that I held back on that 5th star because none of the waiters sang ""Fa Ra Ra Ra Ra"" to us, but since that wouldn't be fair - it'll just be for the lack of complete cleanliness.",0.9097,0.849,0.095,0.056,0.6420227920227919

We had the duck tasting menu. The Pekling duck was amazing. The skin was perfectly crispy and much of the fat roasted off. The duck fried rice was also delish.  The soup and lo mein duck were aveage to me though. So why only two stars? Well first there was a puddle in the bathroom. Secondly, I ran out of napkins and our waitress took forever to come back. Finally, one of the soup bowls had a slimy yellow stain on it. Three spoons were also dirty, one of which had grains of rice crusted on it. Seems like they have not changed much from their ways at the old location. Good food, but always make sure you get the fresh stuff and order to go.

I do love reading some of these reviews; ""got grossed out when my chicken had BONES""... or... ""pieces of cartilage."" Gee, you really must be fun at a BBQ or at a Lobster Bake. Do you eat anything that doesn't come from a box? or your mommy's cajoling you to ""open wide"" while she spoon feeds you? Your food comes from LIVING THINGS that someone killed to feed you. In some cultures (outside of your lily-gilded suburban existence)   they do not eat pre-packaged/ chopped/ pureed and formed meat substitutions (your McRib that you look forward to every year, doesn't come from an animal, but comes from a factory). They also don't have your mother on hand to ensure that you will never see a bone nor a piece of cartilage dare cross your lips. BONES are FLAVOR... you can order a DISH of cartilage (as well as tendon soup and even chicken feet) not only here but in many restaurants that feature other cultures and cuisines. Otherwise, if you firmly believe that ""life is short, so take a bite""... then you will dig this place. Sun Wah does Chinese food really well. How well? I'm not sure, I've never been to China, but I do see some authentic Chinese people behind the line as well as authentically Chinese people eating happily there, as well as some Gwai Lo (which does include me). This IS a family run place, staples like the Hot and Sour soup can cure the common cold (if enough chili peppers are added) and is delicious. They also do this steamed Sole dish which I do have to say, is OUTSTANDING.  Sole (some sort of lovely flounder/ roughy) is steamed with, Soy, Sweet Mirin style wine and Cilantro, finished with a sizzling drizzle of hot Chinese sausages, mushrooms and sesame oil.  Really good. I've had the dish COUNTLESS times, a one-time special that they make special for us when we come in. EDIT: It is now apart of their regular menu... still tasty! Even Chinatown staples like Sweet and Sour shrimp are rather tasty and very generous portions (the reviews that the portions here are ""so small : (  whah "" reminds me of why the U.S. is SO FAT). Beer here is cheap, authentic and cold. Be nice to your girl who seats you (probably one of the owner's daughters), be nice to your servers and these guys will take care good care of you.

Words can not describe how succulent the duck was.  The crisp, fatty skin dripping with the juices of the duck.  The tender, moist meat tickled my taste buds as I ate.  The buns with the radishes, scallions and carrots heightened the flavor of the meat.  I pretty much devoured those.  The soup with the left over duck and the duck fried rice came next.  We gorged ourselves on the duck that we hardly made a dent in the other two dishes.  We did try it and wow, everything was top notch.  And the duo sorbet of mango and raspberry really rounded off our rich meal.  Talk about getting three more meals out of it.  Definitely worth the price tag of $32.   We thought coming here early on a Saturday would have been the best time.  Although we had a great time chatting, we did have to wait over an hour for our duck and when the duck came, the woman who carved wanted to make sure our first time would be great.  The way she was talking gave us the impression that she may have been an owner or one of the owners.  We could tell the kitchen was slammed with orders of the Peking Duck.   Needless to say, the long wait and the lack of service did not deter us from discussing when we would be coming back.  And trust us, we will be back very soon!",0.9925,0.841,0.152,0.007,0.44022222222222224

We were waited on pretty quickly - so we put in our order for the Peking Duck, BBQ Pork, roast pork, and broccoli and shrimp.  Both pork dishes came rather quickly, then the shrimp.  The BBQ pork was very tasty, and lean, but a little too lean for my liking.  The roast pork was prefect - it came out warm - with just enough fat and skin that it complimented the meat.  The broccoli shrimp was stir fried w/ garlic and was prefect for the kids that loved shrimp and broccoli. Then we waited for the duck, and waited.  When we noticed that another table that sat down after us got their duck, at that point my mom lost it and went straight to the front.  What had happened was that the waiter forgot about it. When the duck did finally arrive - it was absolutely delicious.  The skin was crispy, and not dried out.  While they don't do the pancakes, they do have little dinner rolls (anyone that has Peking Duck @ BBQ King in Chinatown will know what I'm talking about) - which my 1 year old devoured.  The soup that comes w/ the duck was sweet and the family really liked the hint of cilantro.  The last duck dish was the remaining meat was used to make a chow men, which was also very good. Before we were ready to go, we also ordered carry out.  Needless to say, we waited and waited... then mom had to run up front again.  The next thing we see - the waitress running into the kitchen.  They forgot again.  From what we were told - they have yet to set up the computer system, so everything was done by hand.

Everyone raves about the peking duck from this place.  I do enjoy it and I think it's probably the only restaurant in the city that serves it up regularly.  Having lived in Beijing, I do not believe this is up to par with that style, but then again they do it Cantonese style, so it's not meant to be the same anyway.   However, when I come here, I tend to order the fish and tofu casserole (I know... just try it. It's surprisingly delicious); the seafood noodle combination; the clams in black bean sauce; the bbq combination platter; any of the veggies... the soups... Oh.. I'm getting hungry again.",0.9869,0.845,0.122,0.033,0.4724024526198439

Meat so succulent is melts in your mouth, the skin according to Ms. Vajayjay ""was out of this world and she would kill for it"". It was perfectly crispy and a flavor that you will never forget. You have to preorder it before you show up and the cost is $30 but you also get with it buns, your choice of rice or noodles (trust me go with the noodles), soup (made with leftover duck for flavor), and finally some watermelon and mango sorbet.

I wasn't really impressed, but get that they have to cut corners somewhere if they're going to charge only $30 for the entire duck meal.  The duck fried rice was awesome, though and my favorite. I'm definitely going back for the fried rice, you can guarantee. It wasn't as greasy as most places are and had a great, basic chinese take-out done well feel about it.

So, yeah, either get the duck or don't whine about your beef and broccoli. The duck: perfectly crisp skin, perfectly succulent meat. Not a hint of gaminess. The duck drumstick from Sun Wah is like the Platonic archetype of a drumstick. All the courses are great - the skin and meat on a bun with veggies, the soup and the fried rice. Just ridiculously good.  If you don't call ahead, there is a bit of a wait for the full duck meal, but that's pretty typical.

I come here for the duck.  If the rest of the food is anywhere near as well-prepared, it is amazing too.  But this is a review about duck.  Quack. The Peking Duck meal at Sun Wah consists of three courses: The skin/meat/bun course, the duck soup, and the duck fried rice.   Some people subscribe to a ""save the best for last"" policy, but that will not hold here.  The first course is the standout in an already excellent meal.  The waitress (who is extremely knowledgable and friendly) carves the crispy skin off of the beautifuly roast duck, and presents it on a plate, along with steamed buns, some carrot/scallion, and this amazing Hoisin sauce that they make themselves - it is a bit thinner and much more delicious than anything you will buy in a jar.  I'd drink a cup of the stuff if it weren't so awkward to ask for.  It is left to us, the diners, to assemble all of this into little sandwiches and enjoy.  It is an incredible flavor and mix of textures. While you are still in the midst of enjoying all of this, the servers will come out with a very large bowl of soup.  The soup consists of duck broth, duck bones (sounds a little weird, but it's where all the flavor comes from - so don't be freaked out!), some cucumber, and egg.  The soup is light, and is a great follow-up to all the meat and bread you've just eaten!  Next they bring out a giant platter of duck fried rice (made with your leftover meat), which is DELICIOUS, but difficult to eat much of at the time because by then I am usually full. The good news is that they will pack all of your leftovers up for you and send you home with boxes full of your leftover duck.  The fried rice reheats well, and I've put the leftover meat into dishes like duck risotto and duck nachos.   All of this comes for $30 per meal (NOT per person!).  Beer is cheap too.  I highly recommend this not just for the meal, but the entire experience!",0.9958,0.833,0.151,0.016,0.6080042016806724

Not only is it good, it's AFFORDABLE. This $30 Peking Duck, for us, fed my girlfriend and I to the brink and had leftovers for 3 people. Yes, it's massive. The dinner is surrounded by one whole duck. The waitress will cut you small slices of the duck then set it down nicely on a large plate. These small slices will be eaten with slices green onion, carrots, special sweet sauce, and chili sauce wrapped in a steamed bun. The duck here is very special. It is the most juicy Peking Duck I've had in Chicago and even the skin wasn't dry. Nothing, absolutely nothing was wrong with this duck. Even microwaving it and having it the next day proved this is one (damn) good duck. Then with the rest of the duck, the leftover meat is made into an excellent fried rice and the bones are made into a delicious duck soup. The result is food fit for 5 people. We attempted this with 2. This dinner started during Chinese New Year this year (2009) so it is still relatively new. Our waitress told us that it's been a great hit and they had recently been featured in the Chicago Reader. I found them through Yelp, but they are getting great exposure! The restaurant probably fits about 75 people max and is pretty dirty, but they are not paying much more for renovations because they will be moving just around the corner on Broadway for their new store.

The Beijing Duck is 4 courses:  first, duck meat ""sandwiches"" with bao and pickled daikon and carrots that you make yourself.  Then, duck soup made with the carcass of the duck.  Duck fried rice and sorbet round out the meal.  All this--with plenty of leftovers for only $30!  A steal!

Sun Wah is only my favorite Chinese restaurant in town, but my favorite restaurant on Argyle and my standby ""I am stressed and need to have my way"" restaurant. If I go on my own, I am moderately stressed. If I ask my wife to go with then I am really stressed. I have a lot of stories about Sun Wah and most have less to do with the duck, Hong Kong pork, or garlic fried ribs than I care to admit. Sun Wah is great family run restaurant that offers one of the top special dinners in town in the Beijing Duck special. For $28, you share a 4 course meal with as many of your friends as you choose.  You get first tableside cut duck in buns, then comes the duck soup, next is the remainder of the duck in duck fried rice, and finally comes house made sorbet. If you are lucky, you get a fifth course of radishes to start.  We love the owner's daughters who have so much energy, knowledge, and willingness to chat. The Duck special is great, but if you want to go off menu, try the Hong Kong Pork or Garlic Fried Ribs. If you want something specifically, I'd call ahead to make sure, you can get it as well.",0.9952,0.719,0.238,0.042,0.564021164021164

The meal comes w/ only 6 steamed buns but we were told we could order more at 50 cents each. Next comes the soup that they have used the bones to flavor, very similar to an egg drop type soup but with duck pieces and a few veggies. Really, I would have been satisfied w/ those two courses, but no, now you get duck fried rice. Honestly, it was nothing special; or it could have been that I was just overstuffed.

2007-12-21,4.0,"You get a BILL with the CHECK... Chinese barbecue heaven!  Is it a restaurant?  Or a carryout place?  It's BOTH.  And man, this place is like eat-every-nite GOOD.   The restaurant and carryout is Chinese, and most likely Cantonese style.  The carryout is most all meats.  And everything is very fresh - chicken and duck especially.  So what, you say?  Let's put it this way - a frozen chicken (rubber) or duck (superball) does not taste like anything I have ever had here.  This is the best Chinese barbecue in the city, unless someone can prove it to me otherwise. CARRYOUT - WHAT TO BUY - Chinese barbecue can be daunting for a newcomer.  Here is a quick guide: Char Siu (char-shoe) - Barbecued pork - the boneless pork flank is marinated and roasted in a sweet style, no smoky flavor.  This is typically of a 5-spice flavor, and is roasted all the way thru.  Use for cooking (fried rice, stirfry with favorite vegetable) or just eat on rice or just eat.  I think this is the best in the city.  It's lean, not too salty, and very consistent.  Start with a lb, I guarantee it will be gone in a day. Soy Chicken (soy chick-en) - soy chicken - sold by the half, this chicken is also cooked in a 5-spice manner + soy sauce, but boiled in this mixture.  The meat does not absorb the soy sauce, since it is cooked whole.  Again, eaten with rice, with some of the sauce included.   Roast Pork - Roasted pork with the skin, prepared in the 'lechon' style.    Crispy Skin Chicken - this is a crispy brown skinned (not breaded) chicken, with a tender interior. It is also sold by the half.  This chicken is prepared by sealing the chicken by pouring hot water over it, marinating and drying it, then deep-frying it to a golden brown.  It is served with a spiced salt and is great as a meal or appetizer.  You might get a head and feet in your order so also ask to exclude them.  That's right, I said a CHICKEN HEAD.  That's how you know you're getting a CHICKEN and not a DUCK.  Crispy Skin Duck - same as chicken but duck.  You will get a duck head in your order, unless you ask to exclude it.  Just a warning, it looks like a drumstick when you first pick it up, until you try to bite it.  Then you realize you have Daffy or Donald by the BILL, and your giving him a TOOTH NOOGIE.   RESTAURANT - WHAT TO EAT - Most everything on their menu is authentic.  If you are less adventurous, try the rice plates.  If you are an eating maverick, try it all!   PRICE - Reasonable.  Both for carry out and for restaurant.   PARKING - Street, and it's BAD.  Park a block away and walk. CAVEATS - If you are cholesterol challenged, there is a fish place around the corner.  If you're a vegetarian, join the fish person.  If you want to get RID of a vegetarian DATE, then THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU.

The interior of the restaurant is pretty plain, making it well suited for a cheap Chinese meal.  They're kind enough to put all the interesting specials up on the wall in Chinese and English.  Usually an English speaker has to merely wonder what the specials are. We ended up trying the BBQ pork, a pan-fried noodle dish, the fried rice, and one of the specials, the spicy fish-sauce chicken wings.  The BBQ pork was a bit on the fatty side, but I just ate around the fatty parts.  The pan fried noodles were delicious, but the fried rice seemed a bit dry.  The chicken wings were a great treat, and I would say some of the most interesting wings I've ever tried.  I'd definitely go back just for those.",0.9915,0.821,0.168,0.01,0.4568707482993197

2007-10-08,3.0,"My partner and I hit up Sun Wah after all the great reviews and talk about $4 dishes.  It was fun and the food was good.  It reminded me of chinese restaurants where I grew up and I was very comfortable in the space and excited about the dishes.  I got the soy sauce chicken over rice, which was very good... although I have a weird thing about eating meat off of bones, and my partner got the combination BBQ over rice.  Both meals were very delicious and we also got the fried wonton appetizers which I loved.  The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because we both got sick from the food.  Myself less than my partner.  I think it had something to do with a slightly undercooked piece of meat?  So while I would not eat there again, I would recommend it to others as I'm sure this was a rare occurrence.",0.9785,0.784,0.186,0.03,0.6887861811391224

The portions are HUGE -- I suggest getting a few things and ordering small sizes (which are not small and average around $4.00 per order).   Yes, there are dead-b-qued ducks hanging in the window, close your eyes is this is gonna freak you out.

It is so flavorful and tender, it makes me want to cry.  Ambiance: My experience eating here was wonderful. Be warned: No one would mistake this place for the height of cleanliness, the bathroom is as disgusting as a first rate Chinese establishment's john ought to *always* be, and the waitress/cooks in greasy aprons who bring you your food are a little absentminded. But on a Friday afternoon, the place was filled with Cantonese workers slurping down bowls of noodles, large groups of Asian families, happily yelling at each other, and lost but satisfied looking white people chowing down on beef and broccoli. The families made me so happy! Old grandparents making horrible sounding eating noises, always chewing with their mouths open, parents stuffing their kids with greasy food, and the kids in turn, furiously playing away at their handheld video game sets. The little girls with those horrible bowl cut bangs like I used to have... Reminds me of good, chaotic, festive times at home in California. Beer: $2.75 for imported beer? My god!

2007-03-13,4.0,"I love this restaurant - cheap, good food, friendly people, easy.  But I give 4 stars just because the meat is hit or miss sometimes. Sun Wah is very authentic and has lots of exotic meat and flavors.. and their description isn't always exactly clear.  I've had ""Marinated Chicken"", which sounds generic and safe enough, but the flavor was a bit... unfamiliar to my taste.  But don't get discouraged to try this place out!! Because their meat, no matter how they're prepared or what kind of sauce, is always cooked to perfection. Tender and juicy. No chewy, cheap meat at Sun Wah.  I usually get BBQ chicken on the way home - 1 pound of deliciously cooked chicken for $4.  Oh, before you go - they don't take cards for orders less than $12. And, especially if you're getting food for 1 or 2 people, it's VERY hard to go over that $12...",0.9299,0.769,0.16,0.07,0.669642857142857

2006-05-25,5.0,"This is a total hole in the wall joint -- definitely not a date place  (though there's a special place in my heart for women that like this sort of restaurant). Probably not somewhere you want to celebrate a special occasion. And definitely, definitely not the place to take your friends after the PETA rally, if the roast ducks hanging in the window weren't your first clue. Speaking of those ducks: I'll admit that I haven't tried the noodle soups or the seafood entrees, but there's a good reason for this. Flip the menu over, and feast your eyes on the barbecued items on rice. Seriously. The combination barbecue on rice, for four bucks (after a recent price increase[!]) has got to be one of the top five best bargains in the city. Your measly four bucks gets you a combination of BBQ pork, roast duck, soy sauce chicken, served over a veritable mountain of rice with a side of Chinese broccoli and half a pickled egg. Unless you have a prodigous appetite, this will be enough food for a reasonable dinner. (The hot tea is gratis.) The two hot sauces at the table (a chili oil and a soy sauce liberally mixed with chopped serrano peppers) will take your friggin' head off, and I mean that in the best possible way. The staff is a bit inattentive at times -- you'll need to flag them down to get a water refill most times -- but they are ludicrously friendly and helpful. This is one of those restaurants that I feel 100% confident just asking the waitress to bring ""whatever's good today."" Getting food to go is a quick and painless process, and you get the fun of seeing the staff hacking away at your entree with big scary Bugs-Bunny-cartoon style cleavers. Two notes of caution: while I've never encountered anything frighteningly unsanitary here, it's not a clean and antiseptic dining experience, so if your gross-out threshold is low, you might be unable to really enjoy Sun Wah. The other thing is that most BBQ items, while chopped into small morsels, like you'd expect at any Chinese restaurant, are NOT boneless. You get used to this pretty quick, but this might take you by surprise on your first outing. But more likely, your experience of your first outing will be like mine: experiencing a brand new taste sensation and then bursting into laughter at the teeny tiny bill...",0.9971,0.782,0.187,0.031,0.5302474452984656

2006-04-24,4.0,"From the outside, it looks like just your typical hole in the wall nondescript Asian place on argyle, surrounded by many more just like it. The roast ducks hanging in the window however only hint at the wonders to be found inside A short walk past the take out counter leads you into two adjoining dining rooms, both small and homey. As soon as you are seated you are given a teapot and a menu with choices enough to sate the curiosity of any gourmet. No dish is priced higher than 9.00 and a number of the dishes are around 4-7. My friends and I decided to order several items off the BBQ menu and share them, since we just wanted to grab a simple lunch. We ended up picking the roast duck, salt braised chicken, and BBQ honeyed pork. Under the BBQ section of the menu dishes are offered in small, medium or large size. Small is about a 1/4, medium 1/2 and large a whole portion of the animal in question. Portions are much bigger than you would expect them to be, and the 3 medium sized dishes we ordered could have easily fed 6. The salt braised chicken (medium), a specialty of sun wah was done perfectly. Incredibly moist and juicy, with a thin layer of skin all around trapping in the flavor of the garlic/scallions oil sauce cooked into the chicken AND served on the side. The roast duck (medium) was crispy on the outside, firm and chewy without being gamy on the inside, and served in a very small amount of juice containing some sesame oil and sugar...a little greasy to the touch, but not to the palate. another winner The BBQ honeyed pork (medium) was our third choice, since we had heard the above two dishes were both specialties of Sun Wah and wanted to see how their standard fare compared. We were far from disappointed. Just the right amount of sweetness to complement the saltiness of the chicken, I was alternating bite to bite in gastronomic delight. And how much did this delicious meal set us back? All that and a bowl of rice for the table cost 24.50 or about 9 dollars a person with tip, and we all had enough to be full and bring back some leftovers for a later meal. The one complaint I have is that this is a traditional Asian restaurant at Argyle: meaning, if you are not that particular ethnicity, you are going to have to be much more assertive to gain the attention, much less the service of the wait staff. We saw our server only twice and had to call for their attention both times, so be aware. So if you're in downtown Chicago, hungry, and broke, catch the red line down to Sun Wah BBQ.
