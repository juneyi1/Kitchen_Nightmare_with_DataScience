2009-08-14,1.0,"Great location but that's about all. The main location of this restaurant on the southside has great reviews & I know people who say it is very good.  However, despite the wonderful location on Chicago River, we  were very disappointed.  Food was spicy but not tasty.  Fried green tomatoes were just crust and mustard without flavor.  Nobody finished their meals.  Most food was too greasy.  Seasoning was initially pleasant, but became too much before we even finished our meals, and a bit offensive a couple of hours later (despite altiods chaser).   Drinks were very small plastic cups , only choices were oversugared lemoned Lemonaid  with undiscernable lemon & Sweet Tea.   Probably just as well the portions were small, to limit sugar intake.  Waitress was pleasant but very ditzy;  fortunately the spills did not land on our clothes.  We had higher hopes for a good local cajun lunch spot, particularly on the river.",0.9762,0.732,0.198,0.069,0.5693181818181818
