2017-07-27,2.0,Less then mediocre for the price.  This place used to be much better alas this is my last visit.  I ordered a pound of shrimp and not only was it expensive it seemed to have a lot of breading and they charged me extra for more cocktail sauce.  I went to Lawrence Fisheries recently got a pound of shrimp was much better tasting and extra sauce was not extra charge I mean the price was over 20 for both places but i was satisfied at Lawrence Fisheries,0.6858,0.877,0.089,0.034,0.5047222222222222

2017-05-27,2.0,"Great varity of fish, a bit pricy but the quality is top. Been going here for many many years. I noticed recently the shrimp were not so great, small and tasting of preservatives. Disapponting, last few times ordered. Not ordering Shrimp there now. The fish is great though still. I have noticed a few other issues as of late. I really love the fries but the portion for a small fry is rather chincy to say the least.   Also my Fish orderes have been seemingly very light. So the last few times I have been weighing when I get home. It's as  I feared as great as the  place used to be it's started a downward sprial, when start chincing on weight of fish and protion size of something as cheap and money making as french fries you know its going to be over. Both recent fish orders  were well under weight in the bag even!   The 1/2 pd I ordered tonight  was 7 oz. in the bag thats an oz and 1/2 light on 1/2 pd thats 2 or 3 pc of fish!  The full pound I got last month was 14.2 oz in the bag not too happy with.  I still love the food but this is not the way to keep my business. Orderes should be over an oz or two not under. The Shrimp should be  of a higher quality they taste low quality and no matter how much you over bread it you can't hide that.  Going back for a pricy meal to get comfortably full is now more of risk, if I'm spending a 20 OR MORE IT HAD BETTER BE GOOD!  Looking for new fish place :( it used to be 5 star all day.",-0.4355,0.768,0.117,0.115,0.45742424242424234

It's a small shop where you pick out your fish, either in fillets or pre-cut/battered pieces which they will fry up for you. Prices are by the pound for the raw weight of the fish.  Since it was my first time there, I figured I'd go with the cajun catfish nuggets, and a half chicken for the hubby. My dinner was cooked up, put in brown paper bags, and off I went. (This is a carry out place, so there's no place to sit and eat.)  As I drove home, the delicious scent of fried fish wafted through my car, and I found myself dipping nuggets of catfish into the tartar sauce. (No mean feat, when driving a stick shift). The contrast of the crispy, spicy batter and the moist, flavorful and tender catfish was absolutely perfect. By the time I made it home, there were only two pieces left, which I thoughtfully saved for the husband. I tried the chicken too, which was moist and juicy, but I thought the batter wasn't quite as crispy as I like. (I had been a bit concerned, fearing that they might use the same oil for the fish and the chicken, but my fears were unfounded.) You can get several sauces for your fish, and they have several kinds of sides, like macaroni salad, coleslaw, potato salad, 3 bean salad, and of course your choice of pecan, pumpkin or sweet potato pie.

My mom used to go here on lunch break from high school and now I go whenever I get the chance.  The food is great! Seafood is much more expensive than fried chicken so if you are looking for a cheap meal try getting a few of the rolls, and a small amount of seafood, some vinegar based slaw (my favorite), and some other assorted condiments, and make yourself some sliders. I have found it's a great way to fill up and save some money.  I have only had one or two experiences here that weren't up to par and that was beside they were training new people.

They have sales on different items almost every week, and they offer a Groupon that will save you $7 every now and then. First, you should know that this place is only to-go. There is no place to sit let alone very little room to stand when it is busy. You go up to the counter, order by the pound, wait, and pay. But you are rushing home because your car is filling up with that fresh fish and deep-fried batter goodness. My favorite fish is the Cajun Catfish. Lot's of flavor, perfect blend of spices, and flaky fish. Half a pound will feed two people if you get something else like fries (which are decent but nothing special). I like their scallops because they have this really buttery texture and slightly sweet taste along with the light batter on it. I like the shrimp. Though they tend to be a little heavy on the batter, they are crispy and succulent! Their tartar sauce is yummy, and I usually use 2 individual cups for my meal. If fried fish sounds like a delicious meal and you're not looking for anything too fancy, you have to try Fish Keg. It's a Chicago staple for seafood.",0.9846,0.832,0.15,0.018,0.5783208020050126

A few days ago I was comparing Groupon offers for two fried shrimp and seafood joints in the city, neither of which were near my usual travelings. My mom began to reminisce about a place her and my father used to go for excellent fried seafood in the 70s, Fish Keg, and wondered if it was still open. A quick search showed it was, so we made plans to hit them up for dinner yesterday since we weren't going to be far. Mom was surprised to see how nothing changed, and the employees said it was run by the same owners from back in the day.  We ordered 1lb shrimp, 1lb fish chips, 1/2lb clams, 1/2lb smelts, and 1/2 chicken fried out of curiosity since it was only $6. Most of the food was brought home to the burbs but I ha to try the smelt, shrimp, and clams first. Oh wow, I seriously have superhuman will power to not eat it all because it was damn good! While heating the food up a little in the oven wad the best way to warm it up, it wasn't the same. The seafood itself was fine but the breading turned a bit hard and did a number on the roof of my mouth. The chicken wasn't bad but if you want chicken specifically you'll go elsewhere, this place is first and foremost seafood. To the few critics I saw below, either you went on an off day or you're judging Fish Keg to lesser quality establishments. First, the prices are in line with other quality seafood joints of this caliber. I just checked 5 other popular places and the shrimp cost the same while a couple other items were higher or lower. None had anywhere near the number of options Fish Keg had either. Second, dried up and bland? No way, sorry. A couple people said the breading was too thick but I didn't think so, it was pretty sufficient and wasn't as much as some places that actually do get carried away with breading. Charging 49 cents for condiments is lame though, and it would be nice if they had a coupler seats.",0.9806,0.831,0.117,0.052,0.5256944444444444

Their 4 piece fried chicken is also a winner: light breading but still enough to give you some crunch. And at $5.39, it's not only a good deal, it's cheaper than the Popeyes a block over.

The hubby and I finally cashed it in last night and I have to say it was a Groupon well spent. What a gem! We ordered a pound of fish chips and a pound of hush puppies with a side of fries. Hush puppies were so tasty and just the right bite size. The fish chips were a delicate whitefish and the breading was crunchy. We also bought their tartar sauce and it was the right mix of relish and mayo. Yum Yum. We were worried the food wouldn't be crispy and hot by the time we got home but to our surprise the breading was just so it remained crispy and delish. It appears they use some sort of special brown bags to keep the food from tasting like brown paper sack and also grease? White Castle can take a lesson from this place.  We ordered when we got there and less than 10 minutes later our order was up. There were quite a few people here for 8pm on a Friday night, too. There are no tables here and it isn't the prettiest location, but we always get to-go so no worries.

She went to the guy that I guess is the owner or the manager and he says do you have cash? I said No I am sorry I do not carry cash. So he huffed and said never mind. I turned and looked at my friend with that Oh Gawd look. In my mind I am thinking OK he has a problem because the credit card companies are going to charge him for this 2.12 purchase so I said you know what how about putting my friends additional amount on my cc would that help? He said its one groupon per person per day. I said huh?

I stopped eating fries here awhile ago, when they changed from the excellent crinkle cut fries to the whipped garbage they have now (think BK's fries).  I always liked the fried chicken, though it's slowly fallen out of favor with me since the price has almost doubled since I began eating it.  This last order of chicken would have been a ripoff even at the original price.  Completely flavorless. However, that's better than the smelts.  I wish they had been flavorless.  I'd guess that I was the only person to order smelts within the last 3-4 days, because they tasted like it.  By far the worst fried smelts I've ever eaten. They don't put salt on anything.  ANYTHING!  The person before me ordered fries and was told that they don't salt them.  My order sure could have used salt, or anything that resembled decent flavor.  Service was friendly and the hours are great, but the food has become awful.

Used to be THE  place in the area to pick up great fried chicken, fish and seafood. Fine fresh fish too. Haven't been there in ages - just wondered what fellow Yelpers thought of the place (before I try it again... heh heh.)",0.8689,0.811,0.168,0.022,0.5740740740740741
