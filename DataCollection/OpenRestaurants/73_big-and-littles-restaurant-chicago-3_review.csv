The fish and chips here are $15 and the soft shell crab is $13. At Belmont, both items are $8. Tacos are also twice as much here. Also, boo for cash only.

2017-08-20,5.0,"RESPECT I've had the tacos here in the past but only at events.  I always thought they were good but honestly event food isn't the same as eating the food fresh at a restaurant. We walked in and noticed the menu board had some items missing from the online menu. The guy taking our order said he could make anything for us even if it's missing. That's called customer service. I wanted the Mack Diddy Burger which has two parties along with cheese, shredded lettuce, pickle and thousand island sauce. The girls both ordered tacos. My wife wanted to carry out but I insisted that we dine in because fries and fish tacos don't travel well.  As we were waiting I noticed that several people who had ordered food after us were all getting their food. It seemed weird that people ordering burgers and the same tacos were passing us. I sent my wife up to the counter to ask if someone had taken our food. They apologized to my wife and informed her that the owner was having my burger remade because it wasn't right and he didn't want to send it out. Unfortunately our trufffle fries, samurai taco and el pastor taco were sitting under the heat lamp baking. They decided to give her the food that was already done. If she didn't go up there then her poor food would have still been sitting under the heating element. The truffle fries were not totally fresh and that's because they were sitting. I'm a fry snob and never order them for delivery. I need them hot and fresh out of the fryer. Part of me wanted to say something but I hate wasting food and understand the costs of running a restaurant.  The girls started to eat their tacos while I waited for my burger. My burger was finally done and when I went up to get it they apologized for the delay. Again great customer service. The burger looked amazing. It was simply beautiful. All I could think is what did it look like before the owner made the chef recook it. I took one bite and I was in love. This burger reminded me of going over to a friends backyard party and your buddy was grilling burgers. Then you tell your friend that he needs to quit his job and open up a restaurant. That's the metaphor that flew through my head after my first bite. These moments don't always happen to me but when they do they are a magical moment. The patties were clearly hand packed and the char on the edge of the meat was just fantastic. The bun was perfectly grilled too. The shredded lettuce, pickle and thousand island rounded out this perfection on a bun. This is one of those burgers that will stay in my head forever. I'm afraid to ever order it again because I'm scared it won't taste this good. I'm going to need the owner to be here every time before I order this burger to make sure it's always this amazing.  While we were eating our food they sent over two tacos for us to try. They wanted to apologize for the screwed up on the burger and our order not coming out together. I can never get mad at great customer service. Things happen in a restaurant and when the staff recognizes it and apologizes then it makes the dinning experience incredible. This might have been a four star review but I have total respect for this place and they deserve five stars. We are all human and saying I'm sorry goes a long way. It makes everything taste better.  We had a great dinner. What a perfect way to end a long work week. Thanks to the staff and owner for having great customer service. Also thanks for making me a burger that will be dancing in my dreams for weeks. I almost thought I made a mistake by not ordering tacos but now I may never have another taco here again. The burger just blew my mind. Don't get me wrong the tacos are great but you've won me over with your delicious burger.",0.9992,0.738,0.206,0.056,0.6498253968253966

It was way too messy and I wasn't thrilled about the batter. My husband had a burger with an egg on top and we shared some truffle fries.

You enter not through the front door off the street, but off the side door where the parking lot is. The place is old, rundown, and can be mistaken for a dive bar. I was a bit intimidated once I entered. Being from SoCal I thought I stood out like a sore thumb staring at the menu for a long time deciding what I wanted even though I had already looked at the menu online before walking here from my hotel! Another thing that triggered an alarm in my head was probably the sign that said Cash Only. Coming on business, I was planning to charge the meal, but luckily for me I had extra cash on hand. If you don't, well, there's a ATM inside so don't worry. But back to the food. I wanted taco's, and that's why I was here, so I went with the Little Samurai, Big & Little's, and Spicy Pork. Two were fish, and the other a meat. Being taco's, 3 filled me up rather good. Each was flavored, stuffed, and done well. If I had to choose a favorite, it would of been the Little Samurai because of the Special Sauce, but the fish was nicely battered and flaky in the Big & Little's which was more traditional, and the spicy pork was tender and had some good char to go with it. Again, the spicy thai sauce they used on it was a winner. From the taco's alone, I'm a fan. I definitely want to try a burger, po'boy, and the fried seafood next time I have a craving. It's another staple to the long list of go to's in Chicago imo. I'm glad I made the 25 min walk from my hotel to enjoy this place.",0.9906,0.772,0.167,0.061,0.4952791461412151

It's easy to get to on the northwest part of river north on Orleans St.  just north of Chicago Ave. They have a convenient parking lot adjacent to the building which is awesome and rare for the city. It kinda looks like a dive on the outside and kinda looks like a dive inside, too.  Who cares if the food is good?!  While it does look divey, it wasn't dirty.  You order as you walk in (took a while for one of the five guys behind the counter to even acknowledge us. Once we had his attention he was very nice.) Prices are very reasonable. They call your name when your order's ready. Ours took about 10-15 minutes. We had regular burger, beer battered burger, fried egg burger and a fried egg cheeseburger. On the side we had truffle fries and Cajun fries. We also wanted to taste the deep fried grilled cheese. All that and one drink for about $40.  Burgers were fantastic!! As good as Small Cheval IMO! They're not huge burgers, but I wouldn't complain. Fries were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The truffle fries were addictive. The Cajun fries were well seasoned but not too spicy. We all preferred the truffle fries. The grilled cheese tasted like a donut surrounding a grilled cheese sandwich-- so nothing to complain about there, but I don't think I'd ever eat it as a meal. It's definitely a good snack like carnival food. Fountain drink (Pepsi products) to wash it all down. Would prefer Coke, but what can you do?

2017-03-15,5.0,"I love this place and I'm getting obsessed. I don't live in Chicago anymore so this is the first place I run to when I'm back. First of all, they are byob! For the awesome food that they have, it's a must to enjoy it with some great beer (or whatever your poison). The food is affordable and much better than what you might find in a bar/pub. You order at the counter and wait to be called when the food is ready. Cash only! Here are the following items I have tried: Softshell crab sandwich-There was a little too much samurai sauce on it which made the fried crab and the bun a little soggy and a little messy to eat as it was dripping out with every bite. I enjoyed it because I love softshell crab, but I like the po boy better. Softshell crab po boy-Excellent. I love this sandwich and the bread that comes with it. It's balanced with the sauce and lettuce. All goes well together. Pork belly po boy-They fill your sandwich with the porkbelly. This melts in your mouth. I wish I had a bottomless stomach to keep eating. I could only eat half, but I loved having the leftovers. The porkbelly was tasty with great consistency because they finish off by frying, so you get the crispy in your mouth.  Salmon poke taco-mine came out room temperature. I don't know if that's normal, but room temperature raw fish isn't completely comforting. I ate it, it was delicious, and I didn't get sick. You can tell that the salmon is fresh despite the temperature.  Fois Gras fries- Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. I love seared fois gras and it's hard to find it not in pate form. I was so excited about how delicious this was. The natural cut fries with the sea salt (guessing) was as best as fries can get. The fois gras melts in your mouth and overcomes it with flavor that you'll fall in love with (if you like liver food items). Truffle fries-solid, delicious, get them.  My next endeavor will be to try the fish and chips. It's so hard when I go because I want everything. There hasn't been an item that I didn't like, so I have a really hard time deciding between something I've already had or something new.  I tried their burger at their Lakeview location, and it was delicious. I would recommend that. I probably wouldn't order it again unless I'm specifically craving a burger because of all the other items that I like more. I've also been to their Wicker Park location and service was a little slower there. I waited longer than normal for the food and it wasn't crowded. I didn't really mind since I had beer with me.

2016-12-02,3.0,"Not sure what the big draw here is.  Granted, for a fast food joint they have a lot of interesting options for tacos, burgers and the like. I was excited to try it for the first time.  The counter girl was helpful in helping me pick something out from the myriad of choices and everything seemed hopeful.  But then... First, I don't like these kind of fries.  That's my issue, but for $4 for a huge basket of fries that are starchy and greasy kind of sucks.  Fries to me should have a crispy outside and be light and airy. These were potatoes dipped in oil.   Second, I asked for the burger to be medium well done. It's so good when the edges are charred, the inside is cooked through and all you taste is burger.  What I got was medium at best.  The further I got into it the redder it was. Again, maybe it's just me, but I don't care for raw hamburger meat.  Ok, the toppings were tasty with pineapple and fried jalepenos.  The pork belly was thick (albeit slimy/fatty in some bites). The cheese and the sauce complemented it nicely.  If only it were cooked.   Finally, the entire time I ate, two kids were running in circles around the entire dining area with mom every so often screaming ""Marco don't run!"" to no avail.  I'm not an ogre, I get it, they're  kids and I can't critique a restaurant for how a patron handles her children.  UNTIL dad comes out and it turns out he works here.  He didn't do anything to stop them from running around either. Around me.  Around other tables. Around and around and around.   Dad should know better or at least care to.

This spot specializes in seafood and meat tacos, with a couple of major standouts that have restaurant goers coming back for more. Two must haves when you come visit are the Soft Shell Crab Po Boy (I mean, LOOK at the photo. It's a giant freaking crab) and the Foie Gras Fries. All I really wanted was to play with the small crab that was laying in a bed of warm toasted bread. Its interior was soft and delicious, and a definite party in our mouths. As for the fries... man, the fanciest of ingredients plopped right on top of a bed of golden fries. Duck liver never tasted so good on top of spuds. Along with those standouts, we also ordered a bunch of soft tacos including the Salmon Poke (amazing sesame dressing) and some of the beef ones. They were all very good, so pick and choose whatever protein you like. I wish we ordered more tacos because it was all so good. Oh, and did I mention that it's BYOB!?

Big & little's unfortunately falls into this category for me... an A-Okay meal overall, but let's do this. 1st... CASH ONLY. Don't forget the billz. 2nd... I don't say this for many places in Chicago, but go for the seafood. Fish, crab, etc. What'd I eat? I did the MANGO CHUTNEY PORK taco ~ Seared Shredded Pork, Pickled Red Onions, Cilantro, Mango Chutney, the SPICY BEEF SHORT RIB taco ~ Seared Shredded Short Rib, Onions, Cilantro, Spicy Thai Sauce, & the MAHI taco ~ Fried/Grilled Mahi, Lettuce, Cabbage, Special Sauce*, Asian Sesame Sauce, Lime Juice. To share, we ordered Phil's Fries ~ 2x Fried Eggs on Truffle Fries. Fries were probably not necessary, but YOLO.  Verdict? The mango chutney pork taco I could live without the mango chutney sauce, if I come back again I would just go for the carnitas taco. The spicy beef taco was good, not great. Not much to rage about. The Mahi was my favorite. Surprisingly some really fresh fish and overall flavors. And lastly, Phil's fries... is there such thing as overly truffled fries? Initially the bites were good, but after some time I just could not do it. I think we barely got through half of the fries. Overall, not a horrible experience, but I question dropping just under $40 for two at a hole in the wall sort of spot. I'll have to give this one another shot and try the Big n Littles special taco & Softshell crab poboy in the future.  'Til next time, cheers!",0.9801,0.813,0.14,0.047,0.36915266106442574

The decor is plastic booths and aluminum tables - like a hot dog stand, and a dingy one at that. Not at all the type of place I'd pop into if I walked past. Although i wouldn't ever be walking past either - it's on a barren stretch of Orleans, surrounded by vacant lots & construction sites. (Groupon is what brought us there) But oh the tacos.  I am a bit of a connoisseur of tacos, especially fish tacos - a passion that began while living in southern California. And the tacos at Big & Little's can hold their own next to all but the very best I've had. (Here in Chicago they're on a par with Velvet Taco and not quite as good as Buzz Bait).  The Big & Little's is your classic fish taco - fried whitefish, shredded cabbage & sauce. Delicious! And 2 of them is enough for a meal, making it the tastiest $7 dinner around. (Buzz Bait's might be a wee bit better - more actual fish, not breading - but you'll also pay double). The steamed blue crab taco seemed like I was eating pure crab! Absolutely delicious. But since it was served cold, the shell was cold too. Ever eaten a refrigerated hard shell taco? Yeah, that was the one downside of this item.  The Mango chutney taco was an excellent pairing of pork & chutney. I initially pulled off some of the red onions, just because I always pull the red onions off. But then the flavor wasn't quite right. So I put it back the way the chef had made it, and all was right with the world again. Or at least with this taco.  Finally, the truffle fries. Didn't love em.

Big & Little's used way too much bread on this sandwich. The overall concept is for this sandwich to be fried shrimp with some form of remoulade sauce and lettuce/tomato on a bun. What I got was a big roll with a maybe 8 shrimps, wilty shredded lettuce as you'd get from McD's and a standard grocery store tomato. Nothing special at all about this sandwich. The bread dominated the scene and it was nothing beyond an Italian sub roll. I think this normally would be a travesty: covering up the delicate flavor of shrimp with too much bread. However, the shrimp wasn't all that good. I could easily replicate from the frozen section of my local grocer. Please step up the fresh and crisp on your shrimp.

2015-10-05,4.0,"I've never been big on fish tacos, but Big & Little's makes the suckers so good I might be forced to change my mind. I initially bookmarked this no-frills, cash-only establishment for its fish and chips, which are just fine but not why you should spend your greenbacks here. No, it's the tacos. My wife goes for the tuna poke and the samurai, while I favor the soft shell crab and a short rib. The former in both cases is the big ticket item. The poke is flavored well and tastes delicious, and the taco is really in-name only, an Ortega-like hard shell. The samurai, Big & Little's signature fish taco, is like a mini fish and chips, with a soft tortilla instead of fries and ""samurai"" sauce instead of tartar. Of the other flavor variations, the spicy Thai offers a nice kick.  On the meat tacos, everything I've tried is good. I'd probably rank the al pastor second, but something that standard is better done at a taco truck or even Big Star. That's why it's worth spending the extra coin for unique stuff like soft shell crab or poke.  The fries can be cajun'ed or truffle'd (both yum, I like the former). And if you're not a taco fan, you can get the goods in po'boy form. As a reminder, the place is cash only.

They have so many different type of burgers, today instead of my old faithful fish and chips I decided to order the Hercules burger which consist of fresh ground beef with lamb gyro and Tzatziki sauce which was really good. My son ordered the bbq burger and a Zeus taco which has a piece of fish with slaw jalapeño peppers and their special sauce. He loves the tacos.

2015-10-01,5.0,"Look - I love food. And that means there's a good chance I'll be scoping out the Food Network and the Travel Channel. And guess who's on the Food Network 50% of the time. Guy Fieri. The GF's not a fan at all, but I can't complain about some of the food that's shown on his show. Heck - I can't complain about Guy Fieri's food either, because I've never tried any of his restaurants (though there's plenty of folks that have gone off on that!). That being said, there's one place in Chicago he highighted that really caught my eye. More importantly, it's been consistently ranked as a Chicago favorite. I mean c'mon - pork belly po' boys and foie gras fries? That's right - I'm talking about Big & Little's.  I stopped by the New Orleans location, which hides a gem within a somewhat sketched out area. Once inside though, there's plenty of seating in the form of patio picnic tables.  Pork Belly Po' Boy [$8] + Fried Egg [$1]  I ordered my pork belly po' boy with a fried egg on top - cuz that's how I do. The over-easy fried egg didn't have a ton of yolk, but I'm all about adding up the cholesterol intake regardless. There was plenty of crisply fried and well-seasoned bits of pork belly to help that along. The crisp pickles helped to provide a small amount of acidic balance, but the drizzle of maple syrup aioli brought this bad boy over the top. The bread was nicely crusty, but eventually it became drenched in grease and maple syrup drizzle. Overall though, a solid bite, if you can get your mouth around it!  Foie Gras Fries [$16]   I was blown away by the foie gras fries though. A must order! A generous lobe or two of foie was on offer, with a nice caramelized sweetness that was surprising. The fatty foie drenched the crisp fries underneath, which were fried up in soybean oil. The spuds were seasoned well, with the pepper really coming through on each bite. Ridiculously good.  I had a chance to talk to co-owner Gary Strauss (the Big in Big & Little's) and it's clear he has a lot of appreciation for the accompanying explosion of business that came with Guy Fieri. Gary and Tony D'Alessandro (Little) were smart though and took their time before opening their second store. Still, business kept booming because they soon opened up a third location. In my estimation, that sort of exponential explosion can't be due to Guy Fieri alone. Consistency and quality are key and exemplified in the fact that they still work at all the stores and shop for their produce daily. They constantly rework the menu, but the classics remain. Because there's no reason the foie gras fries should ever '86ed!",0.9832,0.8,0.132,0.068,0.4432237554112553

The guy at the counter was also very friendly and didn't treat my family as if we were a bunch of pesky tourists like a lot of places did. Food - Most of my family got the fish and chips, which I was glad because I was eating into half of their meals because the breading on the cod is so damn good (if we weren't pressed on time I would have stayed and ordered seconds). The beer batter isn't heavy but still holds great flavor. If you are like me, when you see the massive piece of fish you may be expecting a ton of breading and hardly any fish inside. Here at Big & Littles there is no need to worry about being jipped on getting a good serving of fish. The fries that come with fish are also great. The tacos that they have are also excellent. While the blue crab taco is great, I don't think it's worth the money and would recommend getting two of their other tacos for the same price. Another thing I would also recommend skipping is the truffle fries. The fries are good but the truffle flavor isn't huge and isn't worth the $1 more than the regular fries that are just as good in my opinion.

These are my thoughts: 1. The pork belly itself was delicious. Perfectly crispy and deliciously fatty. It was overpowered, however, by the bread, the pickles, and the lettuce. Halfway through eating the sandwich, I realized I couldn't taste the pork at all for the other ingredients, so I scraped off the pork and ate it by itself. The bread, the pickles, and the lettuce served simply as filler.  2. The lamb-gyro taco was tasty, but they were skimpy on the lamb and the lamb was low quality. This wasn't lamb carved off the spit; it was pre-processed, uniformly rectangular. The Taziki sauce was great, but the taco, itself--meh. 3. It's hard to screw up truffle fries, and they didn't. They were delicious. But they could have been better. I've had truffle fries that were cut thinner, thus creating a larger French-fry-to-truffle-oil-ratio, and therefor , a greater truffle-oil flavor.

And to round out the menu are a variety of different burgers, po'boys, and their famous fish and chips. Fast food done right, this place is unpretentious and has some solid flavors.  I went with the Samurai Taco, Al pastor taco, and tried out same cajun and truffle fries. The Al pastor taco was alright; it was flavorful but a bit salty and expensive for the size($4). The samurai Taco($4.75) on the other hand was great. Large piece of fried white fish, large enough that it was across 2 soft tacos, and topped off with lettuce, jalapenos, and two different types of mayo-based sauces. If you aren't too hungry or are a small eater, this could probably be a meal in itself. As for the fries, both have a solid taste in terms of cajun spices and truffle, and accompany the tacos(or burgers) quite well. Definitely good to grab, or to share if you're with a few people. Verdict: Stick to the fish tacos, particularly the samurai(Fish and chips are probably also good) and the burgers if you're feeling them, and grab fries to share(or to fill you up if you feel like 1-2 tacos isn't enough).",0.9857,0.833,0.151,0.016,0.4685867895545315

It's cash only which is kind of annoying but they do have an atm inside which is nice. The guy taking your order is super friendly so they get a star for having someone pleasant as staff overall seems nice as well. We ordered a few of the ahi tuna and salmon tacos, a soft shell crab po boy and the truffle fries. The only thing that I liked out of the mix were the $4 truffle fries so they get another star for those, as you can actually taste the truffle oil. I kind of hated everything else unfortunately. The raw tacos at $7.50 a piece had shells that didn't taste fresh, they didn't have that super crunch and the fish itself was so so. What I was really here for was the soft shell crab po boy, thinking I would love it. My friends and I all thought they tasted super fishy, like I know you're eating something that came out of the ocean, but it shouldn't taste that way. I didn't like the breading on it, way too oily and it just tasted too fishy for my taste. So overall, the food just didn't wow me since the only thing we thought was okay were the truffle fries. Maybe if I just stuck to the basics like hot dogs and burgers we would have had a better foodie experience, but we were here for the stuff they are known for. Also, we wanted to sit outside but their were no paper towels nor ketchups out there for all the people who choose to eat outside. So I would suggest that they put stuff out there so people don't have to keep coming inside for more condiments.

2015-07-03,4.0,"Last summer I went to the Belmont location one and was blown away by the serving sizes, the quality of the fish, and how well all of the sauces and flavors mixed. However, the Orleans location was not as good as I remembered... Especially the size of the shrimp taco (4 small shrimp pieces maybe?) and the soft shell crab was so tiny (hence the 4 stars). Both locations are BYOB though, so that's always a plus. Cash only though! We came with a $20 groupon, so it ended up being a pretty decent deal for us. However, the sauces and the flavors were still delicious. I especially recommend the Banh Mi taco; it was everyone's favorite with the sauces and all of the pickled typical banh mi toppings. The full Samurai taco is decently sized and easy to share with two (comes with two chunks of fried fish). I like truffle flavor, so the truffle fries were good. I wish the truffle flavor was a bit stronger though. The soft shell crab taco was unique enough that even though it was super tiny for the price, I was glad to have finally tried it (the plum sauce was great). We were pleasantly surprised by how tasty the Japanese beef short rib was (even though at first glance it looks like the most plain taco). 5 tacos and truffle fries is a perfect amount of food for 2 people:  SAMURAI $4.75  Fried Whitefish, Jalapeños, Lettuce, Special Sauce, Samurai Sauce BANH MI $4.00  Fried Whitefish, Cucumber, Carrot, Pickled Jalapeños, Cilantro, Red Pickled Onions, Tartar Sauce, Lime Juice, Sesame Seeds SHRIMP $4.00 Grilled Shrimp, Lettuce, Tomato, Special Sauce, Cocktail, Lime Juice Infamous SOFT SHELL CRAB $7.50 Fried Soft Shell Crab, Lettuce, Special Sauce, Spicy Plum Sauce JAPANESE BEEF SHORT RIB 4.00 Shredded Beef Short Rib, Jalapeños, Onion, Queso Fresco, Samurai Sauce Truffle Fries $4.00",0.9929,0.824,0.161,0.014,0.5849944629014399

Those two areas don't have a lot of dining hot spots but conveniently enough my connecting bus to the blue line had a stop near BIG's and Little's which I bookmarked on yelp.  I wanted to try the ahi tuna taco but the price mentioned here does not reflect the price irl (to no fault of the owners), I'm not about to drop 7.50 for two bites of fish so I had to pass on that. I tried the banh mi fish taco and lthe spicy beef taco as well as a side salad. This was my ""lighter"" fare after eating very rich, heavy foods for days on end in Chicago.  The best was the spicy beef, the sauce was a fantastic addition but otherwise a fairly standard beef rib taco. The banh mi taco was interesting but it didn't really channel banh mi to me- I don't know where they're getting their banh mis but whenever I get banh mis the only thing that is pickled are the radishes and carrots, with fresh jalapeños. It wasn't terrible by any means but it was kind of like a salad taco with all the foliage and it didn't give me that Vietnamese vibe (maybe a little fish sauce based dressing instead of tartar sauce next time?) if you didn't tell me it was supposed to be banh mi I wouldn't have known.  My real qualm was the freshness of the foliage. I picked out a few slimy leaves out of my salad and slimy cilantro bits out of my banh mi taco.

The hard shell tuna taco was generously loaded with fresh, diced tuna and a soy glaze. At $7 something, it's definitely a tad pricey but each bite was seriously a mouthful. The banh mi taco contained a large piece of perfectly fried whitefish with all the standard banh mi fixins' and a spicy sauce to tie it all together. Yum. Solid fish taco.

2015-05-01,4.0,"My original intent was to visit the Big & little's on Belmont in the Lakeview neighborhood, nearby the CTA Belmont Brown/Red/Purple Line station.  I remember hubby and I went on a Saturday evening in late March.  The line was extended to a couple stores west to B&L's!  It made me wonder if all the hype about B&L's was legit after witnessing the snake-line phenomenon.  Since I purchased a groupon a while ago, there was absolutely nothing to lose for trying it out.  The groupon was worth $20 to spend on food and beverages and valid on both locations.  We chose the one on N. Orleans, close to the demolished Cabrini-Green.  There's customer-parking available in their adjacent lot.  Otherwise, it doesn't hurt to take the brown or purple line and get off at ""Chicago and Franklin.""   With Cabrini-Green no longer in existence, this part of near North side is thriving.  Lots of new developments are on their way to completions.  B&L's doesn't look, at all, attractive and certainly didn't ""scream"" delicious food to me.  The N. Orleans location is cash-only, yet an ATM is onsite if your cash was buried by a canny fox.   Luckily, our groupon paid for everything we ordered.  For exactly $20, we had the whitefish po'boy, the shrimp po'boy, and two (2) fountain pops.   Food came out pretty quickly.  I almost dropped that big-a*s piece of whitefish off the buns as I was carrying the food, because I didn't realize that a entire fillet of whitefish was used.  On the other hand, the shrimps on my po'boy were quite large.   Those shrimps were fresh, crispy, and flavorful.  My recommendation is to add some of the ""red sauce"" on the po'boy (the sauce can be found on each dining table).  The portion was generous.  For $8, would you rather have a small, bite-sized bagel sandwich or a wholesome, filling seafood po'boy?   Hubby enjoyed his whitefish po'boy.  He was very indecisive when visualizing the big menu written on the board, but the young man at the counter was friendly and ready to suggest.  I'm proud to say that B&L's is one of the restaurants I will return, with or without groupon.  I personally don't pay too much attention on establishments endorsed by those popular TV personalities or food critics, yet B&L's serves great food, at competitive price-points.  From a consumer's or a foodie's perspective, it makes SO MUCH more sense to patronize a quality local eatery.",0.9885,0.864,0.117,0.019,0.5096536796536796

2015-04-16,1.0,"I previously visited the Lakeview B&L location with my girlfriend in the summer and was unimpressed. Though the customer service was excellent, most of the food was overpriced and average ;the fish tacos were very generic whitefish tacos with an aioli, the raw tuna poke was delicious but incredibly overpriced for the portion, and though some of the meats were quite tasty, after ordering $35 of food--which is a lot for fast casual--my girlfriend and I both felt a bit unsatisfied. Nine months later, I decided to give B&L another chance, and ordered from the downtown location to my office. Three tacos ran me $20 with delivery, which is fairly steep, considering I can get pretty tasty tacos, plus a side and horchata, from many other places off grubhub. Still, I was excited for Japanese short-rib tacos. I LOVE Japanese short ribs. I recently read an article describing how beautifully plated food tastes better. Well, I got the opposite of that. A greasy ripped bag, no napkins or fork, and when I opened it, I discovered my tacos weren't even completely wrapped. With no napkins, the leaking mess was all over my desk in seconds. Already a suspect start. Also, let's be real, writing JAP as shorthand for ""Japanese"" is pretty poorly thought-out. Go ahead. Google ""Jap.""  The first result describes the word as ""...generally regarded as an ethnic slur."" I'm an Asian man. I don't like anti-Asian ethnic slurs written on my tacos. If you abbreviated ""spicy chicken"" as SPIC, people would not be pleased. So let's just agree that it's probably better policy to write RIB on your shortrib tacos, not a nickname xenophobes used for interned minorities. You feel me, my ninja? The samurai taco was served over multiple overlapping tortillas which made it awkward to eat, and it was under-dressed and fairly bland. The JAP taco was actually freaking delicious, but as noted above, very, very poorly labeled.

First off, if you are coming here for tacos, you will be disappointed unless you have been sheltered. This place is for the naive young crowd who don't know any better. I got a shrimp taco that was made by what I imagined was my grammar school lunch lady. I also got the amazing looking soft shell crab which was equally as pathetic. Very fun to look at though. In fact, made my brother jealous with a picture I sent him. Like your average trixie, looks are deceiving.  Someone in a previous review mentioned if the cashier moved a little faster, orders would be done sooner. The wait time is ridiculous. That's for sure. We had eaten and were picking up food for our friends. 50 minutes! Sorry, but that's unacceptable for average food. I also noticed that the cashier/owner basically talked to everyone. That's a good thing in some ways. But when you have people waiting and getting frustrated in line this can be infuriating. Even people trying to pretend they're big shots in front of their Botoxed girlfriends reach over the counter to slap the back of the owner as to say ""Man, I know people all over the city and I'm a super friendly guy."" I feel the owner has fallen into a trap of being so nice that now he has a million best friends. I can't blame him if he is doing it out of enjoyment and his business is doing well. God bless him if this is the case.  I haven't been so disappointed in a restaurant in so long. Want tacos? Every taco place in Pilsen is better.  My wife loved the carnitas taco. So there's that. But also my friends take order was 31 bucks and we were going to tip. She said she gave him 35 bucks and given only coins back. Just saying.",0.9835,0.667,0.199,0.134,0.5634050179211469

My partner in crime ordered the fried pork po boy - it looked fantastic, brimming with meat.   I had a bite of the pork which was tender and delectable.   It looked like it lived up to its expectation.    All in all the whole experience was topped off by being served by Little himself.   Amazing food, fast, casual, and affordable.  You can't go wrong with this place!",0.9936,0.713,0.245,0.041,0.7070987654320988

I opted to try the seafood items as they are popular.   I got these to go and were packed well.

It was greasy (yes i know its battered and deep fired. duh!) But i was mildly disgusted to see the oil and crab juices together..with a fishy after taste. The sauce was good and the toasted bread. Not entirely sure if it is worth the a la carte price. I guess if you got a craving, this will suffice...plus there are not many options out there.  - raw ahi poke tuna taco - this was worth it. Good flavor and quantity. It's smaller than the iPhone 6. I did question the freshness for a millisecond but I gobbled it up with gusto. Maybe I just prefer non deep fried stuff.

I was heartened to see the numerous fish taco options and expansion. I was disappointed at what arrived in the plastic baskets. I still hold on to the delicious Mahi taco memory from 4 years ago. The memory remains, but likely will not be repeated. This year's Mahi taco was maybe a quarter of the remembered size, completely dried out and nowhere near appetizing. Perhaps that explains the drop in price. The Samurai only fared slightly better because of its sweet and spicy contrast, as well as large size. Other than that, I didn't like that fried was tantamount to limpy and soggy. It's fast food, but I hadn't eaten something so sloppily put together since a Burger King fish sandwich run (i.e. poor decision) a couple years ago.

Each item was better than the last, but I'd say that po' boy and the samurai taco were the favorites. Next time, though, the lil' samurai would be more than enough because the larger version is HUGE. The tacos we ordered all had similar toppings, but they didn't taste the same at all due to the sauces used. We also ordered fries--cajun and truffle--because we weren't sure on size. You can definitely split one basket between two people. Our total came to around $30 and we had leftovers to take home.  Important things: cash only, BYOB, and free parking lot next door. The dining areas are pretty no frills with some picnic tables and old booths. Also, it gets busy so plan ahead. We went around 7pm on a Friday with maybe 4-5 groups in front of us.

Started small w/ the short rib taco - zesty, nice, perfectly cooked short rib meat - a little gelatin makes the world go 'round! Samurai Taco - geez, this has a full fish filet on it! Great breading, fried just the way it should be!  Fish & Chips - should be renamed the Moby Dick! - house made fries were good but, picking nits here; they were piled high but seemed to be made from the smallest potatoes that day - very short - seemed oddish. The Cod filet was huge - maybe 12-13"" long, 4-5"" wide and between 1.5-2"" thick. Breading not too thick - just right. AND COOKED PERFECTLY!   Heaven in a basket.  I. Love. This. Place.

There was maybe a total of 3 cubes of pork. Very disappointing.  I should have taken it back.   As far as the place...it's pretty much a dive.  We could barely hear out name called when our food was ready, the dinning room was loud with a group of ""kids"" that had a BYOB party of their own.

The most difficult thing was figuring out how to put the thing in my mouth (ha!), and I most certainly did not succeed.

Hubby already wants to come back to try the burgers. When we left there was a nice line. The only reason why it's not perfect is that the prices are kinda high, about $4 a taco.",0.9509,0.83,0.148,0.021,0.5007142857142857
2014-09-23,4.0,"Quite close to the brown line Chicago stop, this location was steady busy Monday during lunch when we went.  We waited probably 15 - 20 minutes to order and then perhaps another 5 or so minutes for out food to be ready.  Part of what seemed to be the hold-up with ordering is that you cannot see the menu until you are basically up tot he counter.  it's a large menu and the chalkboard doesn't have descriptions which I'm sure causes a lot of questions at the counter. After we ordered we noticed there were paper menus on the counter next to the cash register, two-sided with descriptions of everything.  It's not an exact match to the chalkboards and separate specials menu, but my TIP is if you are waiting in line and don't know what you want, run up to the counter and grab a menu so you can decide while you are in line.   We ordered a variety of items.  A pulled pork po boy, truffle fries, a spicy thai taco, the soft shell crab po boy, ad the shrimp bahn mi po boy.  My favorite was the shirmp bahn mi, unfortunately that's not what I personally ordered.  I got the soft shell crab which made for a great photo and was pretty tasty, but overall didn't have much of a crab flavor.  Definitely different and the sauce was great, but I wouldn't order it again.  The spicy thai taco was tasty also with excellent sauce.  The truffle fries were also pretty good.  Not crunchy, but they were fresh. I think if I went back I would order the deep fried grilled cheese or the ahi tuna bahn mi po boy. Not a place I would go out of my way to eat at, but if I was in the area I would definitely stop in here again.  Unique, good, fresh made, fast service, plenty big to find seating and prices are quite reasonable for what you are getting....   make sure to check if there's a Groupon.  That's what got me to travel all the way there and it was quite a deal!",0.9844,0.785,0.146,0.069,0.5455109126984127

I would pass on the cheese burger (nothing crazy) and try the shrimp banh mi po boy, instead of the traditional shrimp, which is also fantastic.

2014-09-15,4.0,"Big and Little's is a restaurant that serves delicious, pricy food in a very casual relaxed setting. The restaurant sits quietly on the corner, and patrons enter via a side door facing the parking lot.  The interior is function over all else, featuring picnic tables adorned with rolls of paper towels.  Each table has red and green hot sauce (the green is better) house-made vinegar and ketchup.  No need to wear a suit.  On to the important stuff. The food: The Ahi tuna taco was light and delicious.  Sushi grade tuna with a sweet sesame glaze served in a hard shell taco for texture. If you really like raw tuna, it's worth a try. The Hawaiian pork taco is great.  The pork is grilled well, just shy of excessive, along with pineapple.  I'm not sure what they do to this pork and pineapple, but I'm all about it.  If I had to eat only one taco at this restaurant, it would be Hawaiian pork.  That's saying something, considering how much I like breaded fish tacos. The Al Pastor taco was also delicious. Not sweet like the Hawaiian, the Al pastor featured tender grilled pork, onions, and green peppers. The Big and Little's breaded whitefish taco was the most bland item we had. A small piece of fish buried under too much lettuce and cabbage, I mostly tasted the roughage, with a small hint of a mayo-based sauce the fish had been coated with.  The ratios are off with this dish. The Samurai breaded whitefish taco is an elevated form of the Big and Little's taco.  The ratio of fish to lettuce and cabbage was wonderful, and in addition to the mayo-based sauce, there was a teriyaki glaze that added unexpected sweetness to the taco. The sizable portion of battered cod served with the fish and chips may very well best the best I've ever had. Light, buttery, cooked nearly to perfection with a well seasoned, crispy outer shell, it needed no vinegar or additional seasoning.  We requested truffle fries with our fish and chips and were were greatly pleased.  I am a ketchup fiend, but the truffle fries did not really require any. Possibly the best value in the restaurant. To sum it up, $3.50 is too much to pay for a single taco, but the ingredients used and the flavors created at Big and Little's dull the pain that your wallet feels.

Unfortunately, its kind of out of the way for us, and the hours are kind of icky. With our work schedules, it can be difficult to find a time that we could both meet up there. So when we were blessed with the opportunity to eat at Big & Littles one night, we jumped at the chance. We got there a few minutes before they were supposed to close, and Big and Little themselves were there. They didn't turn us away and were so very welcoming. (We still ate quickly so they wouldn't have to wait on us!) We of course had to get the fish and chips and the soft shell crab po'boy. They were worth every penny. The fish and chips are massive, and the fish was crispy on the outside and melted in your mouth. The fries were great too. The po'boy was also great, loved the sauce and the portion was decent (although I think it's basically the same size as the lower priced version at the location on belmont).

I picked up a half order of fish n' truffle chips. There was a line of about 15 minutes at the tail end of lunch hour, which I took to be a good sign. And indeed, the fish n' chips here are delicious. The cod is battered and fried to a crisp. As in, one end is dark brown, that's how crisp it is. It was flaky on the inside and fell apart nicely. The tartar sauce is made from scratch and has a little bit of spice to it; I couldn't tell what spices, but it went really well with the fish. And it went well with the fries. The fries here are mostly tender-fried, but you end up with a lot of crispy bits. Truffle oil makes it nice and earthy. It was a good choice.

2014-08-23,3.0,"Bummer that this place became a real business.  I don't fault them for it, because what they were doing was too good to be true and unsustainable so it was always only a matter of time. Back in 2010 at the time of my first review, this place was further up on Orleans, a tiny house, picnic tables outside, and stupidly cheap. They had to be breaking even on that crab tostada. Now, in 2014, they're down the street by Chicago, in a huge spot, pack out for lunch, have decent tacos and burgers, but nothing super special. My rating scale is to compare an establishment based on it's peers by class and price.  So $3 places are compared against other $3 joints.  At the cheapie price point, BIG and littles was best in class. Then they got some money, got popular, got a picker place, and moved into a higher price point.  And for the same type of food and a lower price point there are better options around the city. It's like the little boxer moving into the next weight class and being mediocre instead of awesome at the lower weight class.  Sorry BIG & littles, you're just not good anymore.",0.954,0.771,0.15,0.079,0.5078270388615217

Three things to note:  - no AC in entrance, AC in seating next door.  - it's kind of on the heavy side. If you're looking for fresh clean and healthy, this doesn't exactly match that. It's not a grease pit, some selections have veggies, but not exactly a place to eat if you're trying to avoid heavy foods.  - budget $10-20 depending. One taco won't really fill you unless you have a small stomach.

We had plans to hit the further north location later on, but, now, with an hour to walk there, seemed like a good idea.  Bam, power walking time. Get there with no time issues at all. *NOTE - CASH ONLY* Order up the fish and chips and a soft shell crab po-boy.  A very brief wait for the food, about 5 minutes, we take up residence outside on the picnic table and here we go. The fish is massive. I mean, like MASSIVE. It's very tender, lightly battered and is absolutely delicious with the tarter sauce you're given. A little extra shot of lemon, and we're in business.  When I say the fish was tender, I mean VERY tender. Fall apart tender, which isn't the best quality to have. The cod was very good though, good quality and still extremely tasteful despite the oil bath. 4/5 on the fish. Our order of chips to go with it wasn't the best. The fries were decent, but, on the soggy side of things. Definitely not the best chips I've had, 2.5/5 on the chips portion. Then, the po-boy. This was incredible. I'm a crab junkie and getting this was a dream come true. Perfect toasty crispness on the bread, amazing flavor from the chipotle sauce thing they put on there and a crazy flavor from the crab. The crunch and batter doesn't take anything away from the crab flavor and helps bring out the delicious saltiness from the deep fried crabbed bastard. Easily a 5/5 po boy.

2014-06-08,5.0,"Fried, truffle and foie gras sums up this place but wait... We are not talking about a fine dining restaurant but an amazingly divey hole in a wall. Why did it take me this long for me to find myself here is unexcused. Plus having friends that beat me in visiting not only this location but the latest Lakeview location that opened in Feb 2014 should never happen. The River North location can have lines out the door though it is somewhat away from everything. Still walking distance from train station they do have free parking available which is rare in Chicago. Picked up two tacos to try - BIG & little's Taco which is fried whitefish, cabbage, BIG & little's special chili aioli sauce, tartar sauce, and lime juice and Fried Shrimp Taco which is fried shrimp, lettuce, crabbage, BIG & little's special chili aioli sauce, cocktail, and lime juice. The fried scrimp in the Fried Shrimp Taco and fried whitefish in the BIG & little's Taco were fresh and fried to perfection. I could not resist so I ordered up a side of Foie Gras Fries to match which were amazing and priced just right. If the Foie Gras Fries were served at The Drake Hotel, we would be paying double easily. I had a few tastes from a friend on their Truffle Fries and you could easily taste the truffles unlike some places that serve Truffle Fries. You could avoid ordering anything fried since they have sushi grade ahi tuna to grilled shrimp for their tacos to po'boys. You quickly see the open kitchen as you walk in, a picture of BIG & little standing next to Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-In's and Dive, and either BIG or little working the counter. During my visit, I had the honors in having my order taken by BIG himself. I told him I wanted to buy a cup for soda but I'll order when the rest of my friends arrive. He told me to pay when I ordered which was cool of him. He was also patient with me as I had no idea what to order when I had to but helped out. This place is divey but that is not a bad thing. The food and service was spot on! They have community picnic tables indoors big enough to bring your friends. Expect to wait during busy hours.

The sesame sauce, and their secret sauce sweetened the taco, but offered a nice contrast to the crisp lettuce and bitter cabbage. However, that corn tortilla is a revelation. I don't even need the second layer of tortilla. The first layer can carry the heavy load.    By far, the mango chutney was my favorite taco. The pork was seared tenderly, and had a nicely charred exterior. The pork was lean and flavorful. The corn tortillas served as the perfect transport for the pickled onion, mango chutney, and cilantro. The mango chutney had a great balance of acidity and sweetness that broke through the char on the pork. Although, I was missing a heat component to the taco, granted I did not have time to add their sauce. I would have most certainty appreciated some jalapenos chopped into the chutney.

Going with Big's recommendation, the samurai taco was phenomenal and probably one of the best fish tacos I've ever had. It was a giant piece of white fish fried in a light batter. The piece was so big that it was bedded over two tortillas - definitely shareable between two people. The two sauces (spicy mayo and sweet soy) made it unique and made me wanting more.

First off, they don't take credit or debit cards, which in 2014 is actually kind of annoying. There have been several times I've wanted to buy my employees lunch from this place so we could all try it but I didn't have the $100+ in cash it would have cost and I wasn't going to go out of my way to get it during lunch, instead, I just picked another spot.  There's only one reason a business doesn't accept plastic in this day and age and it has nothing to do with cost.  They do have an ATM on spot but it's one of those shady little machines that I generally try to avoid. Anyhow I finally did stop in one evening to grab dinner and ended up getting the fish and chips along with a separate order of the truffle fries. The fish was ok.  It was fresh and the portion size was pretty big but it just tasted like a piece of deep fried fish. Nothing particularly special about it and it wasn't as crispy as I would have liked.   They put the fish on top of the fries, which made the fries soggy and the fish really salty. The few fries I could eat were pretty tasty, but the rest were so covered in salt that they were inedible and I ended up tossing them. The truffle fries tasted like regular fries to me and were again too soft for my taste. The service was fine & staff seemed friendly enough. It's close, so I'll be back to try something else and give it another shot, I'm still hoping I'm blown away by something on the menu so I can make it a regular spot but my expectations have certainly been lowered.",0.9898,0.821,0.14,0.039,0.4884987408424908

It is tough to find a BYOB place that has counter service and that serves burgers. The choices are endless here and you will see that right away when you see the menu. Ask as many questions as you want. They always explain their options to you as if it was their first time explaining it when you know they have had to explain it at lease 100 time that day. I have dabbled in the fish tacos and the burgers and both are great. The truffle fries are a must. They also have seltzer water on the fountain. Seems silly but i quite enjoy seltzer water so this is a nice perk for me at least. I think one of the biggest reasons that i keep going back is the service here. Half of the time the actual owners (big & little themselves) are taking your order at the counter, ringing you up and thanking you on your way out.

On the other hand, the portions are so small, you'll spend $19 for two for lunch and feel like you barely got started. We had to go to the dive Mediterranean joint next door for some schwarma & falafel to actually get full. Staff, including the owners, was meh. Parking lot is convenient.

Had the 3 items and 3 drinks from the fountain so the total was over $40. See item totals below. The Pork-belly Poboy was dry and if there was maple mayo dressing on it, I could not taste it. The sandwich tasted pretty oily. No side of fries are included with this. Not worth the $8. The soft shell crab was dark in color and tasted oily and also under dressed. No side of fries are included with this. Not worth the $8. The kitchen made a mistake in reading our ticket and served Fish and Chips instead of the Foie Gras & Fries. When the Foie Gras was served it was served 10 mins later than the other items above. I have had lots of Foie Gras and while this is the first time I have had it served this style, this item isn't particularly special. At $16 it is priced about right, it isn't a dish I would want often because it isn't particularly special and a bit beyond what I would want to spend regularly, but maybe that is the point. Overall, this meal was a disappointment. It is likely the oil is not cleaned or changed often resulting in darkened & oily products. The price point seems a little high for a meal without fries included. I came once because this store was featured on Triple D, it is likely that I will not be coming back again even though I am from the area. Further thoughts. I think there have been and will be lots of folks that frequent this place as a result of being featured on Triple D.

Their crab taco used to be just tart, refreshing limey cold crab meat (lightly dressed) on a tostada, but now they stuff it in a taco shell with mayo sauce, why change a good thing?!?  I did not like it as much and unfortunately would probably not get it again.  The meat doesn't taste as refreshing, I don't like the mayo sauce, and the taco shell doesn't do it for me. I also got their fried fish taco (the more expensive one) and again, it was stuffed with this rich mayo sauce which made it taste really heavy.  The jalapeno peppers and greens on top were key, to give it a freshness.

Keep in mind that it's cash only, no credit/debit cards allowed. There's even an ATM on site, with the obligatory $3.00 surcharge we all know and love. But for the laid back atmosphere, fantastic food selections, and completely reasonable prices, I think it's all worth it.  FOOD: FOIE GRAS AND FRIES  Whoever thought to take a greasy American side and combine it with one of the frenchest, snobbiest-sounding dishes out there--was an absolute genius. The duck liver comes pan seared and bursting with rich flavor. These aren't your average grease-soaked potatoes though. They're dashed with the perfect amount of sea salt, and also come available sans-Foie Gras if you're not into the whole eating meat thing.  SAMURAI TACOS  This is the Katana sword of fish tacos. Jalapenos, sesame seeds, and shredded cabbage/lettuce compliment the crisp but not greasy Mahi-mahi filet. Solid menu staple.  PORK BELLY PO' BOY  For those of you who don't know, pork belly is just uncured, uncooked bacon. At B&L's, it's tossed in Cajun seasonings and fried up, then tossed on a toasted baguette with the house sauce. (So essentially, deep-fried bacon on a bun.) And if that's not a slice of pure culinary genius, I don't know what is. But if you're one of those people that needs their bacon cooked crispy to the point its almost carbon dust, this isn't for you. This is thick, juicy man-bacon.*  *man-bacon not actually from a man.  AHI TUNA BAHN MI PO' BOY  The sandwich you get when Cajun and Asian collide. I'm coining a term right now. CASIAN (on second thought, that just seems like an abbreviation of Caucasian. I'll get back to you). The fresh jalapenos, cilantro, and onions give just enough zest to the sesame-encrusted tuna slices which are all still pink in the middle.  SOFT SHELL CRAB PO' BOY  This is a deliciously deep-fried crustacean on a bun (also available in taco form). If sharks walked on land in Louisiana, this is what they would eat. The crisp came from the batter, not from the shell, and the meat was sweet and juicy. Well played, Poseidon.  TRUFFLE FRIES  Best in Chicago. Crispy, salty and full of flavor.

Luckily, two guys behind me in line were excitedly talking about ordering the samurai taco (apparently a fried whitefish taco) because it was all sorts of delicious and they were in love with it etc etc, so I just thought ""sure, what the heck"" and ordered it along with the truffle fries, and my bf got a hawaii 5.0 burger (a burger with some special sauce and a big slice of pineapple). So glad I listened to those guys because the first bite was a flavor explosion in my mouth! Crunchy with a delicious sauce without skimping out on actual fish or toppings (lettuce, jalapenos, etc). Technically it's just one serving, but it came with two small flour tortillas and the piece of fish itself was big enough to cut in half, so I turned one big serving into two smaller servings and ate the leftover mess with a fork. The hawaii 5.0 must've been good too because it was already gone before I even finished half my taco. Definitely satisfying. The truffle fries were just ok, however. A lot more plain than any other truffle fries I've had. It's very affordable though!

I've eaten some foie gras in my life, so perhaps I was expecting a little too much for $16. Either way, it was still very good. Creamy, with a nice sear. I did find a stringy vein, but I can't expect a fast food joint like this to have the prep time to de-vein all their foie. The banh mi was excellent. Fried shrimp, cucumbers, daikon, carrots, spicy thai mayo, served on the loaves they typically use for their po' boys.

The white fish was cooked perfectly, it was buttery and battered perfectly. All ingredients/ sauces/ fish worked magically to create a flavor bomb in my mouth. Let's just say I had to order another one of these.  The tuna poke taco. This was a cold taco. Very interesting, def worth trying, as I never had a taco like this. The flavors were similar to a simple tuna tartar.  The foie gras fries. This was just foie fras on fries. But OMMGGeee, I didn't like foie gras until now. There was no weird taste, it was just buttery, lightly crispy on the outside deliciousness.  Sweet short ribs taco- korean style short ribs in a taco, can't go wrong The service was impeccable!

I can really taste the truffle oil they use, and you get a nice huge batch of fries. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Fish & Chips 4.5 / 5 The batter they use to coat the fish is amazing. It's crunchy and not overwhelming.  Now if only I can swap the regular fries for some truffle fries. =) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Mango Chutney Pork Taco 4 / 5 There was just enough mango to be sweet and not too sweet.

It was pretty good and I'd probably get it again, though I think there are a lot of things on the menu I want to try, so the soft shell crab might not be my next purchase. Though it was the best looking food I've ever had, it was probably not the BEST food I've eaten. After eating half the sandwich, it started tasting a bit dull. My friend commented that it tasted like a McDonald's McChicken after a while, and I think she hit the spot. I think it's because of the Mayo or whatever sauce that was in there. I think it could be enhanced with different condiments in the sandwich, but the crab itself was really good. Truffle fries: My friend purchased this for our group and I was in awe at how good this tasted. I've never had truffle fries before and each bite I took was a little party in my mouth.

I've never quite tried the burgers here(and maybe I will someday), but I've always stuck with the seafood items, the po boy sandwiches. Also the few times I've felt like splurging here, their fries aren't bad, including their truffle fries. And of course if you can get lucky and hear they are serving the crab tostada(and that it isn't sold out for the day), order it as it is that good. I've never had a bad meal here, from the various times I've been here both at the old(and now) BadHappy location, and at this current and bigger location. Maybe if I ever can get myself away from the seafood and po boy items(lol), I'll try one of the burgers here and see if it's perhaps a 5 star experience?

They have an extremely extensive menu but since they are on N Orleans Street, I decided to have the Soft Shell Crab Poboy and we all shared the Foie Gras Fries.  Soft Shell Crab PoBoy: It was delicious! Probably the best Po Boy I have ever had considering it didn't have anything except lettuce, spicy remoulade sauce and the soft shell crab on a french bun. The Crab was really fresh and even though it was fried, I didn't feel like it was super oily, which would have taken away from the sandwich.

2013-06-26,4.0,"My first impression of Big & Little's was underwhelming; the eating space consists of indoor picnic tables and rolls of paper towels, and the eclectic menus are scribbled on freestanding chalkboards.  Nothing about this establishment suggests anything other than another hole-in-the-wall greasy spoon upon initial inspection.  Newspaper clippings and other memorabilia plastered on the walls, however, testify otherwise.  Big & Little's has been featured on a number of shows, including (appropriately) Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives on the Food Network. Regardless of the trappings, digging into a plate of their food reveals that this little hole in the wall is truly special!  I've tried their burgers, pork po boy, hot dogs, fish & chips, fish tacos, and fries.  Everything was absolutely delicious; I wasn't a huge fan of the truffle fries personally, but their other varieties were quite good.  The fish was particularly noteworthy!  It tasted remarkably fresh and was cooked to perfection.  To top it off, one or both of the owners have been behind the counter every time I visited, cooking right along with their staff.  That's pretty special, even for an operation on this scale. When people ask me for casual dining suggestions in the River North area, this has become my boilerplate response.  Big & Little's has consistently delivered, and everyone I've introduced to this little gem has absolutely loved it! Note: as of my last visit, Big & Little's was still cash only (as they have been from the beginning); they do have a generic ATM on the premises, but if you want to avoid the ATM fee, it's a good idea to stop at your banking institution of choice first!",0.9892,0.804,0.16,0.037,0.45479242979242984

2013-06-20,5.0,"An amazing restaurant like this, which has earned a solid 4 star Yelp average based on its 540 reviews, really doesn't need a review from me.  It's almost a form of piling on.  I mean, what can I possibly say that hasn't already been said? Big and Little has been featured on Diners Drive-ins and Dives, Check Please,  WGN, and will be on Mystery Diners on the Food Network later this summer.  Big is Gary Strauss, the easygoing and friendly front man, and Little is Tony D'Alessandro, Gary's longtime boyhood friend and genius chef who once competed on the popular Gordon Ramsay television show Hell's Kitchen. If you've never been to Big and Little, you will first walk in and then go back out to check the address to make sure you're in the right place.  The single most unique aspect of this restaurant is that it starts out as a true shack.  It looks more like an old hot dog stand than a gourmet restaurant.  Seating is mostly at wooden picnic tables, adorned with rolls of paper towels to use as napkins.  Food is served in plastic baskets lined with wax paper, and utensils are plastic.  They take cash only, though they do have an ATM on site.  You order and pay up front at a counter, and your name will be announced over a loudspeaker when your food is ready for pickup. But what makes this Chicago gem unique, possibly in all the world, is that the food is gourmet quality.  Seriously.  Spectacular, in fact.  On the huge chalkboard menu you will find everything from fois gras fries (several generous portions of seared fois gras atop a mound of freshly cut fries that absorb the flavor of the fois gras juices), 10 different varieties of terrific burgers, fish and chips that rival the best I've had in London, the most luscious, crispy and tender pork belly po' boy I've ever had the pleasure of eating, a terrific soft shell crab po' boy. oyster po' boy, shrimp banh mi po' boy, grilled talapia, whitefish, fabulous fish tacos - and on and on.  In my opinion, Big and Little is an experience everyone should try at least once.  The anomaly of walking into a picnic table/plastic utensil/paper towel joint, having your name called, and then picking up food that is reasonably priced and pure gourmet taste bud magic, is truly an experience.  I have been back many times, and I love the place, but that's me.  I'm sure this won't be everyone's reaction, but clearly mine is a love affair joined in by thousands of other diners.",0.9871,0.85,0.121,0.029,0.5301262626262627

I blame it 75% on myself because maybe I should have just known.  I feel like when ordering they should say...""you know it's in a shell and fried over it right"". Nope that didn't happen. I learned that lesson and wont stray again.  My friends got burgers this time around and they said they were boring. Nothing abnormal from a regular burger which is disappointing.

It's the kind of hole-in-the-wall you remember eating in on Spring Break or some other vacation in Florida. The reggae music that is playing reinforces this feeling so well, you can almost smell the coconut oil on your skin and feel the cheap-beer hangover from last night.

I was all ready to pick one burger from among other burgers, but it turns out that they also have an extensive seafood menu as well as an extensive burger menu.

Well, I still picked a burger because that's what the Groupon was for, but I also made a mental note to return several times to sample my way through the rest of the menu.  Of course I got the one with the fried egg on it and the truffle fries, who you talking to? It came in that little plastic basket lined with paper, with another little plastic basket for the fries.

I ordered two tacos and I'm thankful I stuck with two because they were packed full of flavor and spice.  I think I had the Little's Big taco and another one that had a nice amount of spice to it.  (I definitely forgot the names of the tacos but order any/all and you'll be happy).  My friend ordered three tacos (of course I don't know which ones) and he loved each and every one of them. We were going to have a Big and Little's weekly night so we could hit up everything on the menu but i in order to maintain my figure, that was quickly squashedl.   The guys who work here are all super friendly, they know their stuff so if you walk in feeling overwhelmed, tell them what you like and they'll suggest something delicious right up your alley. This will be a favorite of mine no matter how infrequently I eat here as it is not figure-friendly for us ladies but it is certainlyw orth the splurge every now and again.",0.989,0.791,0.182,0.027,0.6407738095238096
2013-04-26,2.0,"Updated 4/19/13 What happened?  The first time I went here (Sept. of 2012) for the fish & chips it was out of this world, the second time, more like a different world!! I went later in the day, around 6PM, there was only one other person besides me and that was for a carry-out.  Not a good sign if you ask me.  The problem with the fish was that it was cooked too long and the crust was too brown.   Also, it occurred to me since it was later in the day they probably had been using the same oil all day long.  The fries were overdone, too brown, came out limp and tasteless.  Tartar sauce, small portion and too bland.   At $15 I  expected a much better meal than this...and while I'm at it, if you're going to charge this amount of money you could at least add some cole slaw as a side, to cut down on all this fat. One sad note, they've now added a tip jar, I guess they felt they deserve something for handing you your order and charging you for mediocre food!  BTW, the picnic tables are still there. Ughh! If I go back again, I won't be ordering the fish & chips. Disappointed!! .................................................................................................................... Wow!  I ordered just one thing, the fish & chips.   This thing was humongous, 2 pieces of crispy/crunchy cod lightly battered and fried to perfection and soft and chewy on the inside.  It tasted as if it was just caught, extremely fresh. Although it is pricey, $15, it is worthwhile.  Somebody mentioned Duke of Perth being better and cheaper, which I kind of doubt if the pictures posted on Yelp are any indication.  Quality always comes at a price, I'll stick with B&L's thank you! Just so you know it's counter service only, so you have to pick up your food.  You don't have to wait very long though, I only waited 10 min. I do think they could ditch the cheesy picnic tables in the main dining room though.  If you're going to charge higher prices you could at least afford nicer tables. But I did notice regular tables in an adjoining dining room.  Odd configuration, but you get use to it. Finally a BIG thank you to B&L for not having a tip jar next to the cash register!",0.9204,0.904,0.067,0.028,0.49847171347171343

We tried soft shell crab, fish & chips & fried pork belly.  They were all delish.  The fish was outstandingly moist, mild & flaky.  The crisp pork was boiled then fried long enough to melt most the fat.  The crab was hubsters fav!

2013-04-22,2.0,"This place has been on my Chicago Restaurant bucket list since I saw it on DDD months ago.  I'm not sure if my expectations were too high or if Guy led me astray, but this place missed the mark. The set up in the restaurant is strange and definitely not the best.  We waited in line for about 10-15 minutes at 1pm on a Saturday, and the line wraps around right in front of the drink station and between the restaurant and the door.  Needles to say, there are a lot of people shuffling around to make it work constantly, and could probably be easily solved if things were just reorganized.  Similarly in the dining room, the seats are really awkwardly spaced. The second issue is that there is one menu hanging above the register where you order that lists all of the items without any descriptions.  There are lots of named burgers and nothing tells what is actually on which sandwich.  This definitely led to a longer line to order since people had a lot of questions once they finally made it to the front of the line. I got the soft shell crab po boy which was good.  I think this would be good hangover food.  My boyfriend got the pork belly po boy (and to be fair, he hasn't had pork belly before), but it was just so heavy to eat and left him feeling uneasy.  We split the truffle fries which were good but SO salty.  I think maybe they've jacked up the prices since Guy made them popular.  This lunch really wasn't worth $34 for 2 sandwiches, 1 fry, and 1 drink.  On top of that, they only take cash.  They have an ATM in house which is nice, but the whole cash only thing is just a pain.",0.4958,0.787,0.113,0.1,0.5277089947089947
2013-04-22,3.0,"Went to B&L's for the first time early Saturday evening. My boyfriend and I had seen the restaurant on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, and we were excited to try it. However, we were underwhelmed by both the food and the ambiance.  When we entered the restaurant, there was an extremely long line waiting to order. Obviously, the restaurant's appearance on DDD has done it some good. While we waited in line, we looked at the chalkboard menu. Unfortunately, the menu doesn't include descriptions of the items, some of which have names that give no indication as to what ingredients they include. As such, we had to wait until we got up to the register to ask about some items. I changed my mind after we did so. It would be nice if they could get a menu with descriptions or at least include them on the website (which has been under construction for some time now). I ordered Little's Mick Diddy, a take on McDonald's Big Mac, and my boyfriend ordered the shrimp Po' Boy. Neither was bad, but neither was as great as we were hoping. I was expecting a gourmet Big Mac, but honestly, mine tasted not much different than a real Big Mac. The Po' Boy could have used more shrimp. We also got an order of truffle fries. The flavor was nice, but they were undersalted, and the fries were very thin. They were all like those small, crunchy, ""bottom of the carton"" fries you sometimes get at fast food establishments.  Also unimpressive was the decor. The primary color theme was not executed well. It looked like no one really cared how the place was decorated. Additionally, the place looked like it needed a good cleaning. Everything seemed a little dusty.

Fried Egg Burger, lets just say it was the only burger I've eaten that I couldn't put back down until I finished it. Fried Fish Sandwich, the key is in their secret sauce and the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) principle. They keep it simple, fish, sauce, bun, and a few extra lettuce and tomato items. Thats it. Simple a great sandwich.  Shrimp Taco, its a little pricy but well worth it. 3 pieces of fresh shrimp are hidden away in a delectable taco. Fries, if you're going to get some fries spring for the truffle fries. They're excellent and can be shared between 2-3 people. The great thing about these fries is that he uses shaved truffle and salt, not oil which makes the fries soggy. He also fresh cuts his fries and they're all cooked to order! Merkts Cheddar Cheese Dog, you think you've had a cheese dog before, until you've had a cheese dog with Merkts cheddar. It will blow your mind. Simply great good.

2013-02-18,5.0,"stevelerer.com On my final day in Chicago a few months back I was able to stop by Big & Little's Restaurant. This place was on Tripple D and I have been wanting to eat their food ever since. Big & Little's is a interesting blend of a corner burger place and a high end bistro. I was extremely excited to try what they had to offer. When I arrived a only had to wait in line for a short time but that was only because I missed the rush. Only a few minutes later and I would have been in the line out the door so lucky me. I was also lucky that I had some cash on me since they do not take cards. I ordered right from the dishes on the show, I mean who could pass up on pork belly and foie gras? I only had to wait a few minutes for my food to arrive and I used that time to charge my dying phone. Soon I was sitting in front of two awesome looking dishes. First on the menu was a pork belly po-boy. Overflowing on a bun were over a dozen pieces of pork belly perfectly cooked, fatty, and gloriously greasy. Each bite of pork was unbelievably flavorful and paired extremely well with the crunchy pickles. The lettuce below the pickles was also a good addition. Since the pork belly was decadent, as expected, the crisp lettuce helped to cut through the richness and allowed me to keep eating. Lastly, the bread was chewy and tied the entire sandwich together in a nice package. I think the best thing of this sandwich and the next dish was how generous they were with the expensive ingredients. With a pork belly po-boy I think I would have been happy with half the amount of pork they gave me but I'll never turn down more. Now if the richness of a pork belly po-boy was not enough, the next dish put me over the edge. I was literally sweating when I finished but it was so worth it to try the foie gras french fries. There were really only two ingredients in this dish but what a combo! Who would have thought that you could pair the decadence of goose liver with the humbleness of fried potatoes. Definitely a knife and fork kind of side dish. Basically, though the foie gras was served in large pieces, it made sense to smooth it out into some sort of a condiment for the fries. Ketchup just didn't seem appropriate. The look of it after doing that was not picture worthy but it surely made the fries delicious! This was my second foray into foie gras and definitely a much better experience. Big & Little's Restaurant is an unassuming little place with some big bold flavors. One of my all time favorite meals and no service or ambiance to bump up the experience. They rest on their flavors and that is definitely not a bad thing. I was more than happy to spend upwards of $30 for my meal of rich and decadent items paired with street food favorites. I would stop by again without hesitation and try their other po-boys. The oyster po-boy especially. Next time you are in Chicago or if you are there right now run to Big & Little's, you won't be disappointed!

It was a Thursday night about an hour before close and my husband and I were looking for a meal after an event where we get that much food.   I guess I should have consulted with my sister on the type of fries she got when she came. I ordered the truffle fries and they were just ok. I've had better. Thank goodness that was only the side because our food was pretty good. My husband (probably still having flashbacks of our honeymoon) opted for the Hawaii 5-0 which was a burger that had pineapple slices and chipotle peppers. He's not one to go on the very spicy side, but he was being adventurous and ended up taking out the two huge chunks of peppers. That doesn't mean he didn't finish it. He devoured the whole thing....the actual peppers was just a bit much. I decided to go for the oyster po'boy. The sandwich was pretty hefty with a good amount of oyster. The sauce they had was good. Hints of lemon maybe....well whatever was in it really brought out the freshness of the oyster. The oysters were really good and the batter didn't need to have any extra seasoning like I have seen at some other places that have oyster po'boys. Even though I couldn't quite close the sandwich I muscled through eating it open faced (and enjoyed every second of it).  I thought it was just a regular burger joint, but I was wrong. What I most  impressed with was the plethora of seafood choices they had. I really want to come back to try some of the fish tacos or even just the fish and chips. The staff was really friendly too.

2012-12-31,5.0,"I don't know why I'm bothering to write a review of this place, it seems everyone already knows it's awesome. And now that it's been on 3 TV shows it's hard to hide anymore.  I love fish tacos, I love them a lot. Big and Little's is bar none the best place for fish tacos in Chicago, I can't even think of anyplace close. They buy all their seafood fresh, which is not easy to do in the midwest, and it's expensive.  However the prices are quite reasonable considering the quality of the seafood they serve. I wish they had a website so I could share the menu, but it seems to change daily based on what they can get. That's a good thing.  Some standouts: The Mahi taco is one of my favorites. The soft shell crab taco. For real, they put that in a taco, it's amazing. Any of the poke tacos, it's like sushi in a tortilla. I really love the lamb gyros taco, I'm a gyros fan and I suspect this may be the frozen variety, but I can overlook that in a taco. On my last visit I had a sweet and spicy taco with spiced mahi and pineapple, with a homemade sweet and sour sauce.  I also love the crab tostada. It's served cold, but delicious. I really don't think you will be disappointed if you love fresh seafood that is cooked perfectly, stuck in a tortilla with delicious sauce and lettuce. I'm not sure what is wrong with me but I don't enjoy french fries very much. I know theirs are made very well, and they also have good sweet potato fries. But really, I'd prefer to order 3 tacos and make that my meal (2 are probably enough) and skip the fries. Some folks rave about the foi gras fries and I do enjoy eating foi gras, maybe they will make a foi gras taco for me. I would definitely have to eat that! This is a very casual place. The line can be long (having been on so many TV shows at this point) but if you time your visit before or after the lunch rush it's not too bad. I've always gone from work, not sure what dinner lines are like. I don't think I've ever stood in line longer than 15 minutes and the food came out in about the same amount of time.

I will say that the pork belly was made fresh to the point that I burned my upper palate after taking my first bite. The sandwich was full of flavor and the pork fat melted away like butter with each bite. The truffle fries I would not recommend to anyone, super salty and had a weird taste that was not appealing. This would be a great place to eat at during the summer months with large seating arrangement and free parking.  Pro- Lots of unique items such as mahi taco, foie gras fries, and soft shell po boy.

Whoa buddy was my first impression when I saw the size of the fish that accompanied the order because it was J.H. big. Big Big Big. Once I got over the size shock I forked it and peeled back the crispy, flaky coating which was great on it's own, and tore into the fleshy meat. Damn!!! It was hot, moist, and exceptionally tasty. Just came right off in huge chunks, not breaking off and falling apart like some overcooked Fried Fish, but whole and wonderful. Just great. Second, we split the truffle fries. These fries were fried perfectly seasoned, with tons of hints of truffle oil I believe. Sure they were a little steep, but they were good, good enough for me to go back again and try the ultimate, which are the Duck Fat Fries. Can't Wait!!! Third, we split the Pork Belly Po' Boy. This boy was filled with fried up pork belly goodness. So crispy, chewy and salty, and so good. Coupled with the sliced pickles, shredded lettuce, and some mystery mayo type sauce and you've got yourself one heck of a Po' Boy. Finally, we split the Cilantro Cucumber Taco. I was a bit hesitant on this at first, but once I took my first bite, I realized it was certainly my best decision of the day. The shell was basic and seemed store bought and lame, but the fillings of cilantro, sliced cucumber, pickled beet shavings and some sort of cool and refreshing sauce tied the whole taco together. It was just really refreshing mixed in with all the other food which was really rich due to the frying. All in all the place was great, and I never thought twice about the prices which can be a bit much for just lunch... Enjoy Suckas'!!!",0.9952,0.758,0.188,0.054,0.5308945105820105

This is just a nice chill casual place, where you can just pull in to its gravel driveway and park. Seems like a place that would be in California or Chicago, before all these River North areas were bulldozed for crappy town homes. I probably wouldn't go here if there were a line or crowd, but getting there at an off time I believe is key (say 2pm on a weekday if you can swing it). I could have easily ordered more items from the menu, but my sandwich was satisfying. I hear the fries, etc. are great. Fun to watch some of the hipsters come and go as well. Nice summer place to go, kinda outdoorsy, not sure if I'd want to trudge here in the winter.  But bottom line is they have good fried food, done well with good sauces in a picnic table seating, fun environment.",0.9936,0.676,0.274,0.05,0.6753086419753086

2012-09-24,2.0,"I was so very excited to try BIG & little's - after driving past it with some frequency and hearing everyone raving about it on Eater and here on Yelp, I couldn't wait to try it out.  However, once I actually got myself there, I was somewhat disappointed with my dining experience. My friend and I came in straight from the office on a Tuesday evening.  Happily, it was not particularly crowded, and we were able to order right away.  My friend ordered the foie gras burger, and I ordered a shrimp po' boy.  We also got a basket of truffle fries to split.  Our food came out fairly quickly, and we headed over to the south side of the restaurant to eat our food at one of the many colorful booths.  The restaurant was super quiet - I think we were one of two couples in the room - apart from the reggae music booming out of the speakers.  Sadly, our food was not really what we were expecting.  My friend's foie gras burger was a bit of a disappointment, with a huge portion of rather odd-tasting foie gras and a particularly crunchy bun.  My po' boy was rather frustrating and a disappointment to a particularly hungry me. Five heavily-fried shrimp were placed on top of a very thick and crusty roll, while an excessive amount diced iceberg lettuce and dressing sank into the bottom of the roll.  With every bite I took, no matter how I held the sandwich, my little shrimpies would fall off, leaving me with only bread, lettuce, and dressing.  I ended up eating only about half of the sandwich, ultimately choosing instead to consume the shrimp on their own.  The truffle fries were also a bit of a disappointment: soggy and entirely too salty for my taste. Again, I want very much to like this place.  Perhaps my friend and I didn't order the best things - or perhaps it was an off day.  For the price (a fair amount for dive-type food - and over $2.00 for a small [Pepsi-product only] fountain drink!?) and dive-y environment, though, I'm really rather disappointed the food wasn't a home run.  Regardless, I want to be fair and will plan to give this place one more try and update accordingly!",-0.3466,0.819,0.095,0.086,0.5785200216450216

2012-09-13,2.0,"Alright, so first of all, my dissatisfaction of this place didn't necessarily come from the food or the service.. it all sparks from being very, very misled. Let me explain.  I found out about this place through some late night local TV Chicago food show and looked it up on Yelp and thought this place was going to be my new spot! Everyone was raving about the fish & chips and their truffle fries and those are two things I hold dear to my heart. Well the show must've been outdated... so were the pictures I saw on Yelp. Yelp classifies this place as 1 dollar sign and the show + the pictures of Yelp showed a menu from when the place first started I'm guessing. I came to this place expecting to pay 7 bucks for some awesome fish and chips. WRONG.  I guess since then, they've expanded and have also been on Diners, Drive-in's and Dives. That's awesome for them, but after all this new fame they upped their prices! Fish and chips were 15 bucks!! Truffle fries were an extra 3! I was already there and in the mood for good food so I gave it a chance anyway and spent the 18 dollars. Let me tell you right now, the food.....not worth the price. It tasted fine but I'm a frequent goer of Duke of Perth which many of you know has some of the BEST fish & chips in town for 9 bucks (and all you can eat on Wednesdays), and Big & Little's fish & chips didn't even come close to how amazing Duke of Perth's was. If there's one thing that pisses me off more, it's paying big money for something you could've gotten better and cheaper somewhere else. So fair warning to all you first-timers: it's pretty expensive. I mean, I may be back because their menu had a lot of other interesting things on it... burgers, tacos and sandwiches which were all decently priced. Again the food and the service was decent...the guys that worked there were really friendly. But I get cranky as hell when I spend 20 bucks for a meal and didn't think it was all that great.

The burgers were pretty good. I got the Pork Belly Poboy after seeing it on TV. It was a huge disappointment. The process by which they cook the pork belly (as seen on TV) doesn't really give you the best product. I believe they boil it and then flour it and fry it. The result is extremely greasy and totally flavorless; although pork belly is obviously fat on fat pretty much, when cooked properly it is not greasy at all. I love how in the show they overflow the bread with pork belly but in reality you don't get half of that. The fries were pretty good as well, did not try to truffle ones though. After all these and sharing one drink, it came to almost $30, which is pretty expensive in my opinion, and they are not in the best part of town either.

Ordered the ahi poke taco the first time and the salmon poke taco the second and both were really good and you can tell the fish is extremely fresh. the taco shell which I'm 99% sure that it made in house is filled completely with the fish and there is a hoisin type sauce that lines the bottom of it. the po boys look huge and I was looking for something light so I will be ordering that when I am hungry and the fries look like they could feed 4 people. the Poutine fries for those who do not know what they are (I had no idea until I asked them) are fries topped with gravy and cheese curds traditionally. Their specialty Poutine fries have a variety of ingredients which sounds like a meal itself. Keep an eye on their specials menu board. The decor is minimal and there are picnic style tables both inside and out. the condiments and napkins are at the table and meant to be shared and moved around so if you're looking for hot sauce or ketchup and it's not at your table look at your neighbors table. parking is very easy because of the parking lot that it is attached to but beware of the giant pot holes that could eat a person whole.,0.9695,0.854,0.116,0.03,0.6429012345679014
2012-05-28,5.0,"TGIM! Thank God It's Monday because Big & little's is open again for business! I've been day dreaming of the last meal we had there, 48 hours ago.  It was almost painful to skip a day, but with the reassurance that I may return again today, I remained patient.  It will taste that much better anyway.  I ordered the ahi tuna poke taco and yes, it was mind blowing. Fresh, simple, and perfectly seasoned, dressed with a sprinkle of sesame seeds and scallions. The crispy corn taco shell was not too thick to remind me of Tostada chips (hate) or too thin that it just breaks apart on you when you take the first bite. I want another one. I also ordered a soft shell crab taco. Soft shell crab has been my BFF lately, and this soft taco is my homie.  Again, simple: one small soft shell crab, deep fried, on a bed of lettuce, drizzled with remoulade, with two soft corn tortillas. Simple, yet my taste buds yelled, spectacular! when I took the first bite. I couldn't help myself. I spied the rasta oyster pocket on the Specials menu and knew it had to be good. So I ordered it too.  You get a whole lotta huge, deep fried oysters in your pita pocket, along with shredded lettuce, mayo, and sriracha sauce, I believe.  While it didn't disappoint, the winners from the trio I ordered are the ahi tuna poke in 1st place and the soft shell crab taco ranking a solid 2nd.  My friend ordered the shrimp po boy and fries.  She was impressed.  At first, she was skeptical at how expensive everything appeared, but once she dug in, she marveled at how fresh and tasty it was, since its location was in the middle of the nitty gritty city.   Oh, and like the other reviewers advise, cash only. You may experience a bit of sticker shock since it appears to be a shack on the corner selling po boys, burgers, tacos, and fries, but that's where its grungy roots end.

2012-05-17,1.0,"SOOOOO, let me start of by saying we really wanted to like this place.....it looked so good on TV. As you can see by the 1 start rating, that's not what happened.  Myself, hubby, and our 2 boys descended upon BIG & littles after a trip to Lincoln Park Zoo. We were looking for a good lunch and not only had we saw this place on Driners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, but we saw the 4.5 star rating on Yelp; so we were thinking this place has to be a slam dunk! The environment was nice and laid back and we really liked the menu, it was quite pricey, but  we figured it had to be worth it. We ordered: a the shrimp po-boy, fish sandwich, and 2 ""deep fried"" grilled cheeses (yes, it's as bad as it sounds). NONE of the dishes come with french fries, so we ordered regular fries and sweet potato fries. Total: $46....I want to vomit as I'm typing how much we paid for what we got. Here's where it went south: Shrimp Po-Boy: There were about 7-8 shrimp on a very large bun. The shrimp tasted fresh and were a nice size, but the grease in these things was outrageous. I've had shrimp po-boys and fried shrimp at many different restaurants and I can say that these were the greasiest fried shrimp I've ever had. Fish Sandwish: This was a tilapia fillet that was fresh and a nice size. This was the only dish that was acceptable. DEEP FRIED grilled cheeses: This was just awful. I feel partly responsible because I ordered these blobs of grease for my kids, but for some reason I had higher expectations. So, these were literally hamburger buns with a few slices of american cheese in them, dipped in batter, and deep fried/soaked in grease. I can't believe they have the nuts to sell these things. I feel my arteries clogging up just talking about them. Consequently, we couldn't let our kids finish eating these things and we took them somewhere else. I feel much more comfortable feeding them McDonalds than these things (and we are NOT fans of McDonalds). Fries: I love fries and their fries just weren't good. The sweet potato fries were overcooked. We didn't even eat half of them. The regular fries just weren't good, my kids didn't even eat them and they eat ANY french fries. I think our high expectations of this place contributed to our severe disappointment, but we could have spent $20 at Weiner Circle and been MUCH happier.",0.9922,0.794,0.149,0.057,0.4885404965404966
2012-05-16,3.0,"I went to Big and Little's years ago when it was in it's old location and was happy to see they had expanded. On my previous visit I had a tilapia taco that was good, but not so amazing that I remembered to come back until recently on my walk home from work while craving some greasy food that wasn't McDonalds.  I was a bit taken a back by the high prices. I know, I know - better quality and a large portion equals higher price.  I just wasn't prepared for fish and ""chips"" (although okay, these taste nothing close to real chips) to cost me $15 at a place where I order at a counter. Instead I chose the fish sandwich which came with only one breaded fish filet (I don't think I could've eaten 2 like in the fish and chips portion) and a side of fries (not truffle) and it was about $11. The fish tasted fresh, but I couldn't pick it up and eat it as the actual filet slid right out of the breading and made a mess only a fork could salvage.  Maybe it needed to be cooked crispier to prevent this.  A pet peeve of mine is if I just want to drink ice water, why must places give me the tiniest thimble size cup.  I'm not just trying to scam free soda!  Please let me be able to enjoy my meal without having to get up every time I need to take a sip of water. Also they yell out people's names when their orders are ready, and since people were outside so they had to yell kind of loud it got annoying by the end of my meal.  Overall it was a fine fish sandwich, but for not being amazing, being a bit on the high end, and not my favorite location I will probably continue to look elsewhere for fish and chips that can satisfy me like the ones at Beachcombers in Ireland.",0.907,0.797,0.124,0.078,0.5088843537414967

2012-05-13,3.0,"Food:  3 Service:  N/A Atmosphere:  4 Value:  3 I don't normally review ""fast casual"" restaurants (thank you America's Next Great Restaurant for making this terminology mainstream), but when you've got one touting ""restaurant quality"" food from a Chef who was on Hell's Kitchen, DDD, and has 4.5 stars on Yelp, I feel a civic duty to weigh in.  Given all these accolades, my expectations were pretty high.  Unfortunately, it didn't quite hit the spot the way I had hoped.   I will give props to this place for having a ton of fish/vegetarian options for the kosherites like me and my friend who accompanied me.  After what felt like an eternity (not because the line was long, but because my indecisiveness was in rare form that night), I settled on the Whitefish Po' Boy and fries.  The $12 price tag was somewhat alarming, but given that I was recently in New Orleans salivating over all the treif po' boys my friends were able to enjoy, I couldn't pass it up.   Just like the nachos at Hub 51 (see my review), I quickly understood why it mandated such a hefty price.  This thing is bigger than Bobby Flay's ego, and twice as intimidating.  With the fish:bread ratio at about 2:1, I wasn't quite sure where to begin.  I summoned my inner Guy Fieri and just dove in head first.  The fish had a nice, crisp batter on it, and the traditional shredded lettuce, pickles and tomatoes mostly did their job to cut through the richness of the sandwich.  The grilled baguette had the right amount of flavor, but frankly just couldn't hold up to the weigh of the fish.  The mayo-based sauce (some sort of Chipotle aioli, I believe) was good, but there just wasn't enough of it to cover the fish.  As for the fish itself, it needed a pinch more seasoning.   The fries are also worth mentioning, as they are hand-cut in-house.  While I fully support this endeavor, it has to be done right to fully capture the extra love and care that goes into scratch-making these sticks of deep-friend deliciousness.  The taste, color, and size were there, but the flexibility of some of those poor fries reminded me of Gumby doing Yoga.  If this were some standard fast food joint, I wouldn't complaint as much, but given the high expectations this place mandates, I feel the need to be critical.  Like most things in life, a few more minutes in the fryer would have done the trick.   Overall, I would recommend giving this restaurant a try when you want some sophisticated, greasy, clog-your-arteries fast food.  Even with the 3-star review, I will likely return to try out some of their other items (Ahi fish tacos, Deep fried portobello mushroom sandwich, etc.).  It occupies a real niche in Chicago, and if it can make some minor changes, it could become a regular in my dining rotation.  It's just not quite there yet.   [Thanks for reading my review and be sure to check out my other reviews on Yelp.  My mission is to find restaurants that have great vegetarian, kosher, and vegan fare.  On every review, I rate food, service, atmosphere, and value on a 1-5 scale to give you quick and easy overview of the restaurant.  I love cooking, eating, and doing both with my friends and family.  I always welcome your questions, comments, and suggestions so contact me on Yelp or Facebook if you want to share ideas.]",0.9979,0.758,0.182,0.06,0.540202320448222
2012-05-12,4.0,"Q: How do you spend $57 at a fast food stand? A: Big and Littles.  The restaurant is a wonderful little dive with picnic tables on the inside and an open-air kitchen.   My complaints: the place does not accept plastic (only cash) and has a $2.75 charge at the ATM, also one person taking orders is problematic as the customer line is out the door. But let's be honest, these are minor inconveniences before enjoying truffle french fries, foie gras french fries, soft shell crab po' boy and a pork belly sandwich. To the compliments: the truffle french fries were yummy and with a wide selection of different hot sauces- any delusion of too much grease or salt can be easily mitigated.  The foie gras french fries were too good to be true. They were the standard truffle fries topped with two large chunks of foie gras.  Just try to imagine the delightful duck fat drippings pooling at the bottom of the french fry container; the french fries soaking up every droplet...  Slicing off hunks of foie gras and forking them in my mouth with french fries was well worth the price and the highlight of our meal! The soft shell crab po' boy came out beautifully prepared.  One large crab fried perfectly, placed on a bun with some fixings. It was outstanding. The pork belly sandwich was too salty at first, but after I had a bite of the sandwich with the sauce, the sandwich went from fail to great. Pro-tip: they cut the sandwich in half, so start from the inside and work your way out and add sauce the closer you get to the butt of the sandwich.

I was pleased with my selections, and when I'm in the mood for deep-fried awesomeness, I know I'll be back. Here's the details about my visit this weekend: My boyfriend and I arrived around 12:15 to make sure that we were in line to eat at a reasonable time, as I've heard the wait can be frightening, especially on the weekends. There were about 15-20 people ahead of us in line, and we had to wait until about 12:40 to order, which wasn't bad. Fortunately for us (ha) were able to listen to an awful variety of 90s music hits while we waited, which was amusing. We had a hard time narrowing down which items to order, as there was a unique range of items from gyro tacos to pork belly pockets. We put in our order at 12:40 and had our food within 5-10 minutes, and we demolished the food within another 5-10. We decided on the following: Gyro Tacos: I'd been jonesing hardcore for some lamb for the past few months, and this definitely hit the spot. The taco shells were soft flour, which was oddly reminiscent of pita, but was still a tortilla. The tzatziki sauce was flavorful and creamy, but not too cucumbery. There was just the right amount of onion, which complimented the meat and didn't overpower the taco. This was an outstanding taco, and I'm glad we decided to each get one, as I wouldn't want to share. The Fish and Chips: Uhhh, I didn't know tilapia (or whatever other white fish they used) could be this large! It literally covered the entire tray, with a more than generous portion of french fries underneath. The breading on the fish was nice and flavorful, and the dipping sauce was out of this world. Granted, these are no Owen and Engine fish and chips, but they're definitely some of the best I've ever had. My only complaint about this dish was that a lot of the grease from the fish made the french fries soggy, but they were still enjoyable. Lastly, a few more points I'd like to make. The service was a bit slow, but I realize that this is done intentionally so that everyone has a place to sit and so the food is served in a timely manner. Secondly, the place was packed with tourists on the weekend, so if you're looking for a more ""local"" scene, definitely come on a weekday. Oh, and Little was working the grill this weekend--it's always nice to see the owners/founders working at restaurants!

After being deep fried in the oil for so long, the moist pork was as dry as a raisin. The only good thing about the sandwich was the crunchy texture, the sauce, and the toasted bread -- other than that, it was very difficult to eat and finish. In regards to the soft shell crab po-boy, it was deep fried nicely but slightly overcooked and far from being the best I've ever had.

2012-03-05,3.0,"I liked Big & Little's. Their food is pretty tasty. But here's what I am not all about. The prices are ridiculous to me. This is a place I'd go maybe twice a year because I can't justify a lunch that expensive without having a nice place to sit down.  Big & Little's moved several blocks up from where it used to be so I guess this is good for them. Not that big of a difference in distance from work though.  I came by their new location (I've been to the old one before) to find that they've expanded. The set up of the restaurant is completely stupid to me. Seemed like a rushed opening and things were kind of thrown together. There are picnic tables inside lined up parallel to one another in long long rows. A HUGE pain in the ass to get in and out. HUGE. It was so tight that i swiped my pants against one of the benches while walking through and a huge chunk of wood from the bench stabbed me through the pants and my boot. If my boot had not been there, I'm pretty sure I would've been bleeding everywhere. Not safe. Especially for children. Surprisingly there were a handful of kids there so I was afraid some of them would be getting splinters. Second, I like their food but seriously it's overrated. I wouldn't be giving this place more than 3 stars. Here's why. The service takes AGES  - when there's a line, there is a freaking line. You wait triple the amount of time that it would take for someone to get through a Chipotle line at 12pm. And that, is a longgggg freaking line (Chipotle). After that wait, you wait another chunk of time to get your food. By that time, you've walked through those picnic tables at least one or twice trying to save some seats. Possibly stabbed yourself in the leg in the process. Not only that, if you feel like you want some tacos, you probably are going to spend a minimum of $10 for two tacos and a drink. (wtf?). I had their samurai white fish taco. Awesome - but seriously for that price? I wish they had a display case of their fresh caught seafood to show me it's worth paying that money. wtf. A shrimp po boy that I had the 2nd time. $13. I almost passed out. I can get 3 different dishes in Chinatown at 3am enough for two for that much. Yeah, it's Chinatown but they do seafood just as good as Big & Little's. Probably better actually. A lot better. I'm not trying talk sh*t here but I honestly think the prices are ridiculous. I don't get fries and a drink because its so damn expensive for a full meal there. For what reason?! You must tell me why. I want to know why I'm paying this much and waiting this long and spending time at such an unpleasantly decorated ""restaurant"" -- cafeteria/diner. whatever you wanna call it. The food doesn't taste that good anymore after knowing you spent that much. GUILT. You instill guilt B&L! People are crazy about this place.

The fish itself is tasty enough and gives enough texture alongside the lettuce and sauce that it makes a delicious dinner.  - Cheeseburger - The cheeseburger was really meaty but was balanced out by some tomatoes and and onions.

The Greek burger was a little better, though. The stars of the show are really the ocean derived items, so if you don't eat them, it may not be worth the trip down. However, I'm speaking from subjective experience, like we all do, and I wasn't that impressed overall with the land animal options...

There were still about 5 groups of people there - a testament that people will hike to B&L in a half foot a snow to get their grease on. And yes, everything is of the deep fried and oily variety. But oh so tasty too! You enter through a side door by the parking area. Decor wise, there's not much too it. The indoor space has three rows of picnic tables lined up so there is room to sit and eat communally. You order and pay (cash only) at the counter up front and wait for them to call your name. No frills or thrills in the actual space - the cash cow here is in the food. We had the fish n' chips, soft shell crab taco, oyster poboy and an order of truffle fries. Way too much food for two people! The fish n chips alone, would have been enough for two of us as the portion of fish was HUGE. The soft shell crab was delicious but not enough to fill one person. The oyster poboy was my favorite and a substantial size for a sandwich. Good value and good eats. I realize people have been harping on the prices and how they have inflated it. I won't speak to the price increase, but I will say that I really think the prices are reasonable given the portion size and that this is seafood. I wouldn't say it's a cheap eat, but it's definitely reasonable for what you are eating. Will I be returning?

2011-12-08,4.0,"4 stars for a ""fast food joint"" As is fairly common with my reviews, I've been to BIG & little's (B&l) twice now - once at the old location closer to Oak, and the new location just north of Chestnut. The new location is a HUGE improvement. They actually have places to sit, and it's a wide open space. The first place definitely had a problem with ventilation and air circulation, and it got really uncomfortably hot in the summer. I don't foresee this being a problem in the new place. Anyways, on with the food! FOOD: Samurai Whitefish Taco: more or less the signature taco on the menu. The first time I had it, I thought the fish portion was a respectable size. This time around? BIG. Maybe BIG made this one this time and little made my last one? Anyways, it came with your run of the mill pickled jalapenos and the same spicy mayo sauce that re-appears quite frequently on the menu. The whitefish was fried to perfection, and surprisingly not really oily or greasy. Overall, this taco works and it's no wonder it's so popular. So far, this is my favorite thing on the menu. Shrimp Taco: Ok, I think I had 2 pieces of fairly small shrimp in here. The shrimp was cooked admirably, but there seemed to be more weight coming from the lettuce than from the shrimp. This used the same sauce as the Samurai taco, and overall, I'm a bit disappointed with this one.  Lamb Gyro Taco: Yea, I don't know why I was expecting anything different than a run of the mill gyro. I thought they would have done something different, but this wasn't really special. This included a decent amount of meat, but save your money and get a proper gyro in Greektown. Actually, even fast food joints will have a better gyro. I blame myself for this one. There was nothing wrong with it, it just made no sense to get it. Special Ahi Tuna Burger: A delicious sandwich, and fairly priced at $15 given the fat piece of tuna in the middle. The bread is great, and this also makes liberal use of the spicy mayo condiment they cherish here at B&l. I think it was a bit overcooked for tuna, but I don't think that ruined any of the taste here. Definitely one of the ""healthier"" options I saw on the menu! No deep-fried cheeseburger here. Truffle Fries: I loved everything about these, and the claim to being the best truffle fries in Chicago? Probably true. They're just seasoned well and the truffle oil is there, but not overpowering as truffle oil'd foods often are. Not overly salted either, and cooked beautifully. Some fries are crispy, some a bit soggier, but I love that variation in textures in my fries. My friend that doesn't really eat fried foods sat there and kept eating them. At the counter she told me ""you'll be eating most of the fries."" Nope, I'm pretty sure she had the majority. All in all, a slam dunk. Foie Gras Fries: I had these the first time I went. Basically, you throw two generous pieces of rich foie gras on top of the truffle fries and voila! Foie gras fries. They're not $16 (I believe an extra dollar or two from before), but I think they're worth trying.    SERVICE:  This is an order at the counter and go back up when they call your name. There were only a few people in here tonight (around 8:30), but they got food out to you fast.  VALUE/OVERALL:  In general, tacos go for $4-5 and fries range from $3 for the regular, $4 for truffle, and $16 for foie gras. Fountain drinks are $2.50. Overall, a pretty decent value, but some things might be overpriced *ahem shrimp taco at $4* So for a fast food place, I think this ranks up there as a solid option. What kept it from being 5 stars? The mediocrity of the shrimp taco I had, and the gyro taco. Why is that even on there? But the Samurai Whitefish taco, fries, and tuna burger really are some of the best I've had at a ""fast food joint"", and since it's so close to home, I'll come back for more.",0.9986,0.803,0.161,0.036,0.45287918239725483

STRIKE #1: I began by ordering the pork belly po'boy.  When the sandwich came, it was deep fried pork belly, with no sign of any pork meat, only glistening cubes of fried pork fat.  I tasted one piece and gagged.  I took it back to the counter and told them i couldn't eat it.  The Big owner asked if i had ever had pork belly before.  My answer was ""yes, but there is usually pork meat in it"".  He was not to happy with my response, which was fine, because i was not too happy with the $11 po'boy.   Strike #2; The Little owner, to his credit, offered to make something else for me.  I asked for the Steak terriyaki, and offered to pay the difference, and he said not to worry about it.  This sandwich came piled high with deep fried who knows what and a few cubes of steak.  It was dripping in grease and some sort of mayo.  This I attempted to eat.  The bread was horrible, so i used a fork and picked at the toppings.  If only i had just left that po'boy and walked out. Strike #3:  My buddy Jay and I split an order of the truffle oil french fries.  The fries were skinny, tasteless and heavily oiled.  McDonald's does fries better. 20 minutes later I'm at Clark and Barlow and my stomach is spinning and I push my way into their bathroom just in the nick of time.  Up comes the little food i was able to put down at BIG & little's.  My stomach heaves several more times and the tank is empty.

The crab was not slightly warm and the tostada made it all work.  Am I expecting a little too much from a counter service place if they aren't friendly or talkative?

The Po' Boys here are fantastic as well.  Huge sandwiches.  The shrimp and crisp pork belly are my two favorites.

One order of fries is definitely enough for two or more people to split, and I have a feeling I could order them crispier next time. They also came thoroughly salted, which I appreciated.

It was wall to wall people when I walked in. Everyone wanted these delicious foods....I got in line to order. I knew I wanted tacos. I was debating between the tilapia and the mahi mahi, but I decided on the tilapia since the mahi portions were GIGANTIC. As in, a huge slab of mahi in a tiny tortilla. I also wanted a shrimp taco, because I adore shrimps. I shall have my mahi another day, though... Anyway, I finally got to the front of the line and ordered. And waited. And waited. And then I waited some more.  After all that, I finally got my shrimp taco and my tilapia taco.  O M G First off, by the time I got my food I was starving, so I ran out the door and immediately started eating the shrimp taco, like some kind of scavenger. It was not my most dignified/proudest moment. I falcon punched that shrimp taco. It was so good. Fried shrimp in a double layer of tortilla with (what I think was) chipotle mayo, tomatoes, red cabbage and lettuce. It was so fresh and delicious tasting. That staved off some hunger, and I ate the tilapia taco when I got back to work. The tilapia itself was smokey and flakey from the grill, and it also had the same combination of red cabbage, lettuce and chipotle mayo. Mmm, also very good.

It's fried pork belly on a toasted roll  with chili aioli,  lettuce, and maple glaze. you get soo much pork belly that the sandwich doesn't even close and you have to eat some pork belly off the sandwich first just to get it to almost close. It was def an interesting take on pork belly and I enjoyed every artery clogging bite of it. i can't say anything new about the fries that other people haven't. they were fried to crisp perfection and seasoned so well that youdon't even need ketchup. I loved my food, every bite of it however my friend did not. le sigh. she got the fish and chips and i tried a few bites and it just seemed like the fish soaked up some grease while frying...maybe a batter issue but i'm not a fan of cod anyway so I'm not sure on that.

This place, I'll have to say, is a place you definitely to go.  I ordered fish and chips (on a Friday) w/ substitution of truffle fries ($2 extra).  The rumor was that Big and Little's provides excellent food with very affordable price so I was very surprised that a plate of F&C cost $12. However, my doubt disappeared when I saw that gigantic, lightly battered and perfectly deep-fried piece of cod.  The batter wasn't overly seasoned, which allowed the flavor of the cod to come out.  The truffle fries was a little too salty to my taste but the aroma and the texture were great.  I will just need to tell them to put less salt next time. Fish and chips, shrimp and chips and foie gras and chips are the only items that are $12.  Everything else is under $10, including the fish sandwich.   The location was very accessible.  You can drive there with plenty of street parking or take the public transportation.  There is only one downside of this place.  There is very little seating in the restaurant itself but the turnover rate was fast.  Worse come to worst, you can always take-out and enjoy the food at home, on the street or somewhere of your liking.  I am definitely going back there again and try every single items on the menu.  Have I mentioned that the food was fantastic and CHEAP?",0.944,0.827,0.113,0.06,0.5382296466973886

The shrimp po-boy and taco are both great. The shrimp taste so fresh and fried and crispy. Great shrimp. I wasnt thrilled about the sauce on either one. I loved the tarter sauce with the fish but the ketchup-y sauce with the shrimp was mehhh. Despite the mehhh sauce, the shrimp are a must.

Since I had a personal recommendation to try the Mahi tacos, burgers, and truffle fries, all of those were definitely happening.  My girlfriend wanted a burger (I knew I would get half), and so the guy at the counter made a quick recommendation for the crab tostada.  Done. Each one of these were great.  The crab tostada vanished so fast even I wondered what had happened to it.  Real crab meat with a dash of lime and some zing all on a fried tortilla -- great.  The Mahi tacos come with a large filet of fish and a great scotch bonnet sauce that gives it some heat.  The burger is juicy and cooked simply.  You know it's good meat when they don't have to do anything crazy to it to make it taste good.  I am a sucker for truffle-anything, so the fries were a must order.  This was the only part of the meal that was less than perfect.  They were good, but my girlfriend and I agreed that they were a bit too salty, and I would prefer them a little bigger to hold up to the cheese better. This is not in the best neighborhood or very easily accessible, but that might actually be a good thing.  It will prevent me from eating there all the time, which is good for my health, and there was no line and open seating at 5 pm.

As a side note..the seating is stools with tables affixed to the walls.  There is just something about that kind of table setting.  Its not exactly social, but its prime time to enjoy the quality of the food in the mist of the illusion of solitude.  And obviously be prepared to carry the aroma of fried food as a parting gift.  Its inevitable dining in at a open kitchen restaurant..but as weird as it may be I enjoy it.

The toppings were fresh and discernible. The burger was well constructed. The entire affair was quite similar to a FiveGuys burger (a very good thing), perhaps not as greasy. I would have preferred a potato bun or brioche, or at least toast the bun. The fries were excellent, if not cut a little short. It seemed as if all the fries I had were little guys. But they were perfectly seasoned and I could really taste the truffle oil. It was not an extra $1.50 apparition. I'd definitely go back, post lunch rush or on the weekend to see if my experience is any different, but it is quite a well run operation considering the size of the place and the crush of customers.

Now today we wanted to celebrate at Kuma's for my buddys bday, but they were full. =( Be that as it may, we decided to check out our places we had bookmarked and opted to try out something new. After being unanimous, we made our trek over to BIG and littles. Now heres the thing w me when trying food at potentially delicious looking places. I go big. I always say, go big or go home. That being said, on my first trip I chose the soft shell crab po'boy, mahi mahi taco, and a basket of truffle fries. If nothing in that sentence entices you to check out BIG and littles...go to your nearest McD's and drown yourself in the joy of a big mac. First off, soft shell crab po'boy. Wow. Amazing! Great crunch from the soft shell crab, the sauce had a nice taste to it, all resting on some lettuce and embraced by a hot toasty bun...whats not to love about it! I was eyeing the soft shell crawfish po'boy as well, but I figured Id save that for another time.  Next up : mahi mahi taco. Now i asked for a fish taco, and the woman at the register asked me :""tilapia or mahi mahi?"" now for a dollar difference between the 2, I chose mahi! When this came out, I couldnt believe it. its pretty much a whole filet of mahi mahi, on tortillas, with greens and sauce. I HIGHLY recommend this to first timers, you will NOT be disappointed. Ask for some lemon, a little sprinkle on this delight doesnt hurt either. ;-) And of course, no meal would be complete without my favorite fast food side, fries. Not just any fries mind you, truffle fries. MmMm. I was looking at the foie gras and fries, but ask anyone whos eaten foie gras and theyll tell you its pretty damn heavy after it sits. So I left that for my next visit as well lol. Definitely get an order of truffle fries, the taste alone is worth it. In review, BIG and littles is worth checking out.

THE GOOD:  EVERYTHING!! we had the truffle fries which is a MUST-HAVE!! oh it was sooo good!  It was so flavorful and just melts in your mouth.  Don't order cheese with it though because it's not needed and you may offednd the cook.  We also had the crab tostada which was pretty OK.  Good thing it was a small serving because after a while, the taste gets a little old.  The Shrimp was really BIG and crunchy without leaving a ""too deep fried"" taste.  Another thing to try is their soft shell sandwich.  It was crunchy, tasty without leaving a fishy taste. THE BAD: there's not much bad thing to say about this place besides the fact that they don't accept credit card.  But after talking to the owner, he said that they're looking to install an ATM! There's not a lot of seating area. The place is kind of sketchy at night. BOTTOM LINE:  this place was pretty good... and FAST! Their truffle fries are a must have.

It took about 20 minutes to get my 'Fish and Chips' and 'Mahi Taco'.  The fish was very good, you get 2 pieces for $8.50, which includes fries.  The fries are greasy, overly salted.....the first few bites are very good, then the salt overwhelms you.  I'd have asked for a replacement of lightly salted fries, but once you have your spot at the counter to eat, you don't dare give it up.  The Mahi Taco was pretty good.......I say that because it was drenched in thousand island dressing.  There was a very generous piece of mahi, and the double tortilla shell is a great idea, I'll just ask for very light dressing the next time I visit.   The burgers looked good on the grill, and I'll try them again if I am in the area.   Fish and Chips, Mahi Taco and can of diet coke cost me almost $15.  A burger, fries and soda would probably be around $8-9. Overall, A-OK to me.......but with the parking problem and scarce room to sit and eat.....it won't garner 4 stars from me.",0.613,0.887,0.052,0.061,0.4792490842490842

In an area of the city where my mom insists on clutching my arm to the point of bruising with one hand and fiercely hugging her purse with the other, Big & little's is not a place that I would ever have noticed, let alone patronized. However, my friend Brian mentioned B&l's to me earlier this week and Yelp assured me that it was worth a try. We ordered an assortment of items and enjoyed them all. I had a mahi fish taco (special of the day) and a shrimp taco, my dad had fish & chips and my mom had a cheeseburger and we all shared an order of truffle fries. The fish taco featured a large, char-grilled piece of mahi mahi which was cooked to perfection and well seasoned. I didn't really feel as though the toppings or tortilla brought much to the table, so I just ended up eating most of the fish on it's own. The shrimp taco was just a little spicy (too much so for my Mom) and the toppings again didn't add much (especially the tomatoes--didn't make much sense to me). The fish & chips was awesome--the fish was breaded in a thick, soft but crispy breading that reminded me of a better version of the breading on the chicken fingers from Chili's that I was obsessed with in high school. The two pieces of fish are gigantic but don't taste too fishy. The accompanying fries are their regular fries--crispy, well cooked and perfectly seasoned. And the truffle fries...oh, the truffle fries. Cooked to perfection, deliciously balanced and in a giant serving. A $3 order of truffle fries was more than enough for the three of us to share, and my parents even took some home. My parents were like wide-eyed children as I told them the tale of the mythical truffle and I fear that they will try to order truffle fries from a suburban McDonald's later this week. All in all, the food was delicious and even my super picky father was impressed. The three of us ate for $27 (two tacos, a cheeseburger, fish & chips, an order of truffle fries and two sodas). Four stars because they don't have air conditioning. In 93-degree weather with a severe hangover, I was dying but the food was good enough that for the most part I didn't even notice.

The Yelp app led me here from my nearby hotel and on my third attempt to try it (first time: closed for the day, second time: closed for July 4, third time: torrential storms) I finally made it inside.

The sandwich came out of the fryer a few minutes later, topped with cheese, and remained almost untouchably hot till I was done terrorizing it. This sandwich is hot & messy (read: great) and the tartar sauce adds the perfect amount of zing! to it. It was crispy throughout, and a large enough portion that you could probably split it with a friend. I appreciated the soft sesame seed bun to help neutralize the amount of rough chomping required. Truffle fries were delicate and subtle, not at all overbearing with funghi flavour but the portion was huge even by my fry monster standards. This was also the first time in recent memory that I haven't had to salt my food (I salt fries by default) - they were perfectly seasoned. Cans of pop (called ""soda"" here) are fairly priced at $1 each.

This time I chose to have the fish sandwich, sans cheese, which was crispy, flaky and delicious. I had the pineapple & beet salad which was good but could have been so much better. It was made with canned pineapple and seemed like canned beets too- shame albeit a tasty combo/idea.

Luckily for me, B&L successfully exorcised those Pepto-inducing demons. I couldn't be happier about this place! For one, they've completely re-imagined the environment. What was once a fairly depressing and intimidating place, they've turned into (what I imagine) Key West on Orleans. While I was there, there was plenty of island music, the guys wore Hawaiian shirts, people drank brightly colored fruit sodas, and everyone seemed really relaxed. I knew, instantly, that I was in for a good experience. I know people rave about the truffle fries but nothing about truffle fries says 'Key West' to me. I went for the sea food.

Take note of this: delicious. Even though the portions are street food friendly, you'll eat enough to fill you up. In addition to the tostada, I got two tacos: shrimp and fish. The shrimp taco brought some heat. I don't know what they season it with but it has just enough of a kick to get your attention. The shrimp are plump, juicy and well-fit into the taco. Along with the seasoned shrimp, expect to munch on lettuce, tomato, onions, and a chipotle mix that reminded me of remoulade you'd get in New Orleans. Similar to the shrimp, the fish taco was sorta veggie friendly (red cabbage, remmy) and filling. For about $3, you'll get a flaky piece of fish served lightly battered and entirely delicious.

I never considered hopping off the bus during my commute home to stop at any eatery along this stretch - until now. I always knew good fish and seafood could make me elicit naughty noises - some things never change. I pass B&L's every workday on my bus ride; after reading the raves on Yelp, I hatched a plan to eat here. I pretty much skipped lunch the day of my visit to ensure I had the appetite to eat all I wanted.  The inside of B&L's is simple, just a cooler with beverages, the prep area and some seats along a bar on the opposite wall. You can eat outside though, which I did. It's not a very pretty area, just two tables next to the building, on part of a gravel lot that doubles as cab parking, but hey it's still outdoor dining. I ordered a shrimp taco ($3), crab tostada ($4) and a mahi taco on special ($4). The mahi taco was a-FREAKING-mazing! The fish was cooked perfectly and the portion generous. The cabbage on top and creamy chipotle sauce complimented it perfectly; it set the bar very high for my other two items. Next up was the shrimp taco, which was damn fine too; the shrimp was so fresh and tasty it was almost sinful. It was neck and neck for my affections, but the mahi won out. The only item I wasn't blown away by was my tostada. Despite the heaping amount of (cold) crab, it just seemed to be missing a little something.  As much as I wanted to return the following day, I was afraid it might send me into a downward spiral of addiction; I did return later that weekend (on Memorial Day) only to find that they were closed. Extremely disappointed, I wiped the tears off my steering wheel and sulked all the way home while plotting my return visit. On my next visit I can guarantee I'll have more tacos and try those truffle fries. They have more than fish-related items, they have burgers too, but frankly I think the seafood and fish items are too good to pass up - all that fresh fish and seafood for $12 was a deal!

From other reviews it looks like I might be missing something.   Now it can be a tad on the expensive side but you're getting better ingredients then you would at some whole in the wall burger joint.

Offering some interesting choices like the famous duck liver + fries and truffle fries for a bargain, I was hear for the fish n' chips! I heard there was a parking lot we could use but nothing was clearly labeled but we were able to find parking close by. Since there was only one cook, the food took a while to come out but that's okay. I liked that you can stand there and watch him cook while listening to some reggae blasting in the joint.  When I got my food, I noticed two large deep-fried goodies. If you dusted powder on it, it could pass as a funnel cake. As I forked it open, I can see the flaky fish steaming. The batter was on point- crispy and not caked on there like a pancake. Beneath the fish was a mountain of fresh cut fries- really not my thing. Tasted burnt with the skin on.  This place was neat but is it the best fish n' chips I've ever had? No. Not in a million years. I've had better from places on the Navy Pier.

This evening I decided to wander a mile-and-a-half away in search of a highly rated fish 'n' chips joint. The neighborhood got a little sketchy as I walked. I pulled my bag closer and mentally rehearsed a few of my newbie Jiu Jitsu moves in case. Three blocks later, I found myself in front of BIG & little's. ""I've never been here before,"" I said. ""What's good?"" ""Everything,"" a man I took to be BIG replied. I looked at him. He elaborated: ""Well, we're known for our fish 'n' chips and fish tacos."" ""And the foie gras is good!"" the guy who might be little chimed in. I have to say, I was skeptical. Foie gras in a fish 'n' chips joint in a sketchy neighborhood of Chicago. I went with the fish 'n' chips. What I got: a big styrofoam container of fried awesome with tartar sauce (and a couple of tiny lemon wedges) for $9. A few people left soon after I started eating, and a few people came in as I was leaving. The staff and patrons called out their hellos and goodbyes to one another. They must be regulars.

The menu may be limited, but everything we tried was tasty and fresh. The highlight of the meal was the crab tostada - it tasted like a crab ceviche (maybe it was?), really fresh-tasting crab with a bright citrusy note + crisp tostada. Nothing more, nothing less. The fish tacos were also good (though I wish there were an option for fried fish, not just grilled). Still, fresh, great slaw, slightly spicy sauce. Shrimp tacos weren't anything to write home about, but no complaints. Just a little bland in comparison with the crab & fish dishes. The price is right, too! Everything we had was less than $5. The only downsides are that there is very little seating area inside - a counter along the side wall that seats MAYBE 8 - and few other places around the neighborhood to just sit and eat on a bench. Also, because the place is so small, I can see it getting cramped/service getting slower if there are a lot of people.

We parked on the street and walked in to see that the place looked like your normal ""order at the counter"" restaurant.  Then we saw the menu.  You've got your normal assortment of food, then you have the fancier items.  We went for the more basic items--fish tacos and shrimp tacos.  Can you say yum? The last time I had fish or shrimp tacos this good, I was in Tijuana.  Sure, it was a different style, but these were magnificent.  The mayo was sooo good.  If I was hungrier, I would've gotten more.  That and we'd ordered chili cheese fries.  I think that just about explains itself.  My heart can be bought by chili and cheese.  Just sayin. The guys there were very friendly and shared that they have a private lot--which is certainly good to know as this stretch on Orleans doesn't look the nicest and parking can be hard to find.  We were also told that they open up a patio area in the summer when it starts getting warm...guess that means I'll have to go back in the summer, bring some beers (I hope it's BYOB!), snack on fish tacos and fish and chips, and get some chili cheese fries.  Sounds like an amazing summer day to me.",0.9961,0.774,0.205,0.021,0.5194444444444444
2010-04-17,5.0,"On the border of what once was one of America's 'worst neighborhoods' sits a quaint newly constructed mixed-use cinder block 3 flat which holds Big and Little's. This stretch of Orleans has been quite neglected compared to the surrounding blocks during recent history, and is still one of the few businesses on the block. At first pass B&L's seems like that neighborhood Vienna beef hot dog joint that may or may not be passing health code, and even pulling up to the place today I found myself deciding on getting the average fried shrimp or hot dog.  I found myself in a state of vertigo after taking in the switch between my previous apprehension and what was actually on the menu. Then, being a rather 'thrifty' person, I was completely floored by the prices. After a mental two thumbs up went through my head, I started questioning the aesthetic of the establishment. I'll put it like this.... Big and Little's is that gas station that appears on horizon after you've been pushing your car through a mirage of a desert highway. But it isn't considering that its only 1 39/100 of a block from Chicago and Orleans (which happens to have a gas station). It appears as a low budget hot dog joint, but their minimal menu is expertly executed. The entire experience is teeter-tottering between what seems to be a mob front and the best fast food you may ever have.  Big and Little's is a complex thing. The food is fantastic. The place is amazing. It makes about as much sense as R. Kelly's Trapped in the Closet parts 13-22-- you can't tell if the guys are marketing this place to be as peculiar and bizarre as it is or not -- but if intentional, is a true stroke of genius.",0.7546,0.843,0.079,0.078,0.453168044077135

Oddly enough it reminded me of a McFish - a familiar food made with the highest quality ingredients. My handsome companion went whole hog and tried the foie fries and fried shrimp. The foie was lightly seasoned and seared with the rendered fat used to drizzle the fries. Talk about decadence. It was unbelievable and well worth clogging your arteries.

I wouldn't put in up there with Paradise Pup, but it's very good in it's own right.",0.9647,0.727,0.25,0.023,0.7046938775510204
2010-03-05,4.0,"Just returned from lunch (fish and chips), first time visit, obviously will return: Fish - two portions, battered to order, very simple and tasty ; tartar sauce was very good, not quite great status (tartar sauce snob, sorry); for what you pay at the Elephant and Castles of the world, great value for $8, left full.  Still looking for the best fish and chips in Chicago, BIG & little's earns contender status.  Debating how well the fish would be if taken as carry out though.  Fries: appeared to be handcut there and honestly are some the best fries I've had in Chicago - shoestring style with skin on the ends, put on some kosher salt provided, opted against the malt vinegar - not a fan of it. Portion of the fries were huge. Would return just for these if it was more convenient. Both owners were there preparing the food at said visit, I trust this place in terms of quality. Tougher to get to than most loop spots, halfway between the Chicago and Sedgwick brown line stops. Decided to dine in on the rail, reggae-like music playin. Definately a gem, will return to try some of the other menu items...fyi cash only, one customer had to go across the street to an atm.",0.9171,0.816,0.12,0.064,0.5527694235588972

The so-called chips aren't proper British Isles-style chips, but I have yet to come across such chips anywhere in North America.  They're pretty good for fries, though, and the rock salt used to season them is a nice touch.  With a healthy lashing of vinegar, they make for a nice feed in and of themselves. The star of the show here is the fish, though, and for that, we can overlook the chip issue.  Fresh, flaky cod loin, it's well-battered and cooked to perfection.  The prices are very reasonable for the quality of food on offer and the fact that you're in downtown Chicago. Check out BIG & little's if you're up for some fish and chips.  No booze, though, so your beer will have to wait.",0.9836,0.787,0.196,0.017,0.583076923076923
2010-02-12,5.0,"After reading an article in the Tribune about this new restaurant, I decided to give it a try.  While I am not a fan of fried foods, sometimes I have a craving for it.  The last time I had fish and chips was in London about 8 years ago so it was worth a try.  I was not in the least bit disappointed with the fish and chips at Big & Little's.  The fish and chips were better than what I remember eating in London--fried to perfection, moist, fresh, tastey with tartar sauce, fresh lemon slices and packaged nicely. Two large pieces of breaded cod along with a large portion of fries (so it is really fish and fries--not fish n' chips). They use fresh cod (the loin part which is meatier) and bread and cook it right before your eyes.  I requested that they not salt the fries which they were happy to do.  The owners Tony and Gary are extremely nice guys and happy to answer any questions about their restaurant and cooking.  The menu is simple and they focus on fresh fish (cod, shrimp) and burgers and the cooking is done right there in the open while you wait.  The restaurant has a counter that can accommodate about 8 people but I would imagine the bulk of their business is carry out.  The restaurant, while simple is clean and welcoming with a yellow awning out front.  There is a free 25-car parking lot immediately to the north of the restaurant which can be accessed from Oak street.  The restaurant is located at the southeast corner of Orleans and Oak across the street from a church in a changing neighborhood.  It is a safe area with lots of new luxury condos to the southeast while low income housing in the region is diappearing.  Despite what others have said about its location, it is easy to get to--from LaSalle Blvd/Oak, go two blocks west to Orleans, make a left turn southbound and it's right there on your left.  The restaurant is only 3 months old and could use the support of the community.  I am happy that these dedicated restauranteurs are offering simple fare well-executed.  My suggestions would be to change the copious fries to perhaps cottage fries and add some home-made desserts such as brownies or bread pudding.  I will be back to try their hamburger made with angus beef and will bring some friends.",0.9932,0.844,0.136,0.02,0.48487012987012995
2010-01-31,5.0,"A workmate recommended this place to me - citing that it was given an enthusiastic thumbs-up by someone who had partaken of fish and chips in Australia (see a few reviews down) - and with it being so close to work...how could it have taken so many weeks to finally heed her advice? I am a damned fool. Dragging the (willing, though possibly slightly-skeptical) Husband along, we located this simple, hole-in-the-wall fish and chippery with limited seating and menu. This bodes well - I'd rather a small menu of specialties than an expansive one of rarely-mades, and I love the intimate, unpretentious space. So...where to start. Fish and chips - was it halibut? - in a fresh, light, crispy batter, slice of lemon, and melt in the freaking mouth delicious. Tartar sauce on the side. The fries - well, the 'chef' tossed those babies in a big silver bowl as, you know, proper chefs do - it was sexy to watch. Even sexier to unleash a brown malt vinegar torrent where it truly belongs...gosh I love/miss that stuff. They were amazing, those fries - the Husband had cheese on his, being American. Freshly melted cheese in a tiny stovepot, thank you very much. And the crab tostada? For $4? Yes, I love these guys, if only for they know exactly how to wield some lime. The tostada, the super-fresh and crunchy fish tacos (2 for $3? Either that, or they undercharged us), they brought a single tear. Everything made from scratch, right before your unbelieving eyes. Next time: squid taco? Grilled shrimp? Something else utterly delicious and somehow decadent? Made by actual chefs who care about quality of ingredient and flavour? For a really, really reasonable price? The word's spreading, so get there before you have to wait an hour in line (the joint's tiny).",0.988,0.817,0.145,0.037,0.5151178451178451

Nice!     2) Fish & Chips Another guy hand breaded the fish.  It was more like a fish roll since it was dense. 3)  Fried Egg Hamburger I had to get one and the first bite had yolk dribbling all over.  Good sh*t.

2010-01-05,5.0,"Holy fish and chips. So here's the story. I went to boarding school in an Australian beach town and my afternoons were often spent by the ocean. But NOT before stopping by the local chippy and picking up some piping hot fish and chips. Beach, fish and chips, and good friends. Life was rather sweet. Sigh... BIG & little's, you bring me back in a most glorious fashion. Your fish fillets are fried harrrd (just the way I like it, baby), TITANIC and juicy as all hell. Your fries form a perfect bed of hand-cut starchy goodness. Your homemade tartar sauce is smooth, tangy and beautifully white: the crème de la crème of all tartar sauces. Also, malt vinegar. Thank you for having the bottles available so I can properly abuse this privilege! What is fish and chips without malt vinegar? Exactly. We get each other.

My wife had the shrimp and fries which I think I should've ordered. The fries were still small but the shrimp were large and had an excellent coating to them.

2009-12-18,4.0,"Gourmet fast-food it may not be, but they sure do serve a mean chili and shrimp taco. My friend alerted me to this new hole in the wall a day before I read about it in The Dish. We are always looking for good cheap eats and this fit the bill. The menu is simple, one side has the fish dishes while the other has meat options. The three of us patrons ordered fish & chips ($8), Chili bowl ($5) and a shrimp taco ($3). The report on the fish & chips was positive, I stole a french fry to confirm. I ordered the shrimp tacos and asked for a side of chili to taste. Boy, for $3+ I had some real tasty food. The chili was down right nasty good, full of beans, tomato chunks, corn and meat. I'm a huge chili fan and this makes me want to go back for more. The nacho cheese topping added a little creative touch that I appreciated as well. Following the chili I attacked my shrimp taco with speed. The first thing I noticed was the light and zesty citrus sauce and lettuce topping. It really made the taco feel refreshing, even on a blustery freezing rain night in Chicago. After those two dishes you'd think I would be happy to leave with good food in the belly. Well I wasn't quite in the mood to leave yet so I turned around from the counter (the place has 8 stools for the counter and is 5ft wide) and ordered (per the suggestion from ""BIG"") the crab tostada ($4). I probably didn't need any more food but I wanted to give them business and try more items. What I really didn't need was the free course of fish tacos that ""little"" brought out for all of us to try.  Unfortunately I needed the fish taco even less because I didn't think it was nearly as good as the shrimp. There was a nice topping of bright purple cabbage that made the dish more fun, but it also came with a lot of orange spicy tartar sauce that I could have done without. And then, after all of that food, my order of crab tostada arrived. Needless to say I wasn't hungry anymore, but I did my duty to explore the menu. Again, I should have stopped after the shrimp taco. The crap meat just didn't seem to have much flavor of anything. It looked like it was prepared well, but I couldn't taste it. At the end of the day, I would go back (though it isn't the easiest place to get to) and recommend other people check out this cool outpost from a former Hell's Kitchen contestant. I may not have loved the fish tacos or tostada, but the chili was amazing and the shrimp tacos are second to none. I would try the fish & chips, chili dog or anything else. Check it out for lunch if you are in the neighborhood, or grab something on the way home. If I did not mention earlier, the value is ridiculous. Other critics have said they charge too little and I'd have to agree. Go now before they realize, or go now for good food.",0.9972,0.769,0.173,0.058,0.5268327952649986
