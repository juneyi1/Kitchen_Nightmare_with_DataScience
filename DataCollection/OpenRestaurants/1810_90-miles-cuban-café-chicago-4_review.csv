So worth the dehydration. I'm not really a mathmagician so I'm not going to estimate the mileage from Cuba to Chicago... but the fabulous Cuban flavors that have made their way over to this desolate stretch of Clybourn - in an old hot dog shack no less - have lost positively nothing in translation.  Take one step in the kitchy snack shack, then take a deep breath... Smell that? It's like liquid gold up your nose. Those scents of authentic dishes simmering away... plaintains, yuca frita, empanadas, pork, rice and beans transport you somewhere tropical and so far removed from Chicago, it's the best vacation you could ask for this close to home.  I'll go out on a limb and confidently say you'll enjoy anything you order here... there's something for everyone, even you hard-to-please picky eaters. Big highlights for me were all of the empanadas (especially the one with guava), the lechon (pork) dinner - so tender, so flavorful - and the bistek (steak) dinner with loads of garlic punch and amazing onions saddled up to the best and tangiest black beans I've ever had. My wishlist for the next visit includes a few of those famed sammiches... especially the Media Noche w/ ham, roast pork, swiss cheese, pickles and mustard on sweet bread. Shut Up! I die! Now, who's comin' with me?  And lest I forget to mention the service. Shame on me. It's amazing. Alberto, the owner, works the counter effortlessly in true salesmen style... not to say he's sleazy (not with those good looks, Darlin'), he's just incredibly personable, friendly, outgoing and 100% invested in the satisfaction and feedback of his customers.

What señor dueño needs to do is get better employees and a larger space.  The girl who took orders couldn't understand the request of No Onions/Cebollas.  She asked me twice if I wanted them, checked twice with my friend AND actually put them in another customer's meal.  She must have an onion obsession (maybe it's necessary for the Cuban authenticity, but they already prepare tender Ropa Vieja so who cares if there's no onions too).  Not to mention that both employees don't speak Spanish and pronounce every food item like pure Gringos.  I thought 90 Millas would have a larger seating area as in a restaurant, instead of being a 10 seat, primarily take-out joint.  I guess the Cuban wall decor makes up for it with wallpaper of Cuban newspapers and fun paintings on the exterior.  Oh well, it was worth the trip.",0.9836,0.874,0.103,0.022,0.4873626373626374

2008-11-23,5.0,"Now, THIS is what I am talkin' about!  No, ""Pan Cubano?  What's that?"" Or, ""Drink this nasty stuff we call a milkshake.""  No, 90 Miles is the real deal and nearly everything about it is incredible. It was a cold, drab and dreary late-Autumn day when I found myself on the way to 90 Miles.  I hadn't gone grocery shopping and rather than do it, I decided to get some Cuban food.  One Belmont bus ride later, I arrived at the small, but nicely designed restaurant.  The murals reminded me of Florida, the walls are covered in Cuban newspaper clippings and the blackboard has everything you need to know about that yummy food that awaits you.  Judging from my open mouth stare at the blackboard, the owner offered me a menu so as to concentrate on my order - and stop my drooling.  He didn't need to offer.  I knew what I wanted: a pan cubano and black beans.  He asked if I was cold from being outside (""yes"") and suggested some soup in lieu of the beans.  At the point, his wife (and co-owner) said, ""He wants beans!  You gotta have beans on a day like this, right?""  Since the onslaught on my senses had rendered me as open mouthed and immobile as Ralphie in the presence of a department store Santa Claus, I nodded and was directed to sit at the dining room counter (along with everyone else). I retrieved my Coke, pulled out my stool and started to take it all in.  CNN was on the tv, but all I could concentrate on were the great smells, refrains of Tito Puente-esque (yes, I know he's boricua) drumming, colorful menus and relaxed atmosphere.    Lost in my reverie, I almost didn't notice that my food was in front of me.  There it was: crispy white bread, ham, roasted pork, cheese, pickles and mustard, cut diagonally and pressed flat.  And a cup of black beans.  The sandwich tasted every bit as good as I remembered from my days in the Sunshine state.  The black beans were full of flavor, thick and rich.  I added some hot sauce to my beans for an extra kick.  I only needed a couple of drops to make it perfect.  As I finished my meal, I gave the thumbs up sign to the female owner, smiled, bussed my table and, trying to be suave whilst maintaining conversation with her, threw away the basket my food came in.  At least I saved the silverware from a trashy fate.  Just call me, ""Grace."" I'll definitely be back.  Next time, I am getting the lechon sandwich...and black beans.  Come to 90 Miles and get the BEST Cuban food in Chicago, hands down.  The decor is inviting, the music is great and the food is outstanding.  I do have one caveat you should know before coming: be prepared to preserve and up your sexy.  You do not want to roll in here with a baseball cap and your 'fat sweats.'  ""But, Johnny T,"" you ask, ""why not?  I am coming here to get a serious grub on.""  Yes, you are.  BUT the owners are both so strikingly attractive, you're going to want to look good as well - just to be in their presence.  Not since Brangelina took over the tabloids, have we, as a society, been faced with such a great looking couple.  Bronzed skin?  Check.  Jet black hair.  Check.  Great teeth?  Check.  Great attitudes, amazing food and gracious personality?  Check, check, check.  If we're stuck with 90 months of cold winter, there's no other place better than 90 Miles to bring some needed heat to the season.",0.999,0.772,0.192,0.037,0.5427808302808302

2008-11-20,5.0,"I saw a blurb on this place today and as I mentioned to a client and friend of mine about it, she stopped me in mid sentence and said ""Yes!! My boyfriend loves that place!!"" Well... that is about all the recommendation I needed. Hearing that they do take out, I decided to stop in on my way home. The place is small, but there is street parking and a small little lot to the side of the place. Walking in, the walls are plastered with articles, autographed photos, news clippings, money, comics and other mementos of Cuban life. If you do choose to eat here, the areas are small, more like a sit on a stool, munch on a counter place with bottles of hot sauce in front of you. No fancy tables or anything like that... 'cause you know what? (What?) It doesn't need it. The food itself is pretty damn amazing.  The owner is behind the counter, super nice and very friendly. I was curious about what somethings were and he was more the happy to explain them. I decided to get the chicken dinner, (chicken, choice of rice and beans and sweet plantains), and an order of yuca con mojo. Just under $14, I eagerly anticipated getting home. By the time I got home, my car was swimming in the smells of garlic and spices, but more or less my head was and stomach were spinning from my hunger pains and eagerness to check out my dinner.  I opened up my container, Sweet Jebus! There is a lot of food here for $14!! A large butterflied chicken breast well cooked, not dry but not super moist, (kinda how I like it), with a ton of sauteed onions on top. A huge helping of dirty rice, (I can be dirty sometimes...), and three slices of sweet plantains. The chicken was great, flavorful, but not overwhelmed with spices, the rice was the same, not too dry or wet, but full of flavor and the plantains were soft, but firm, sweet with just a touch of savory. Then came the Yuca con Mojo. The yuca really is a cassava, (think a really starchy potato), which you can get either stewed or fried, (I got fried), and came with a great garlic sauce. The sauce really is more like an olive oil with garlic in it and I want to say vinegar, but really be careful, there is enough garlic in there to choke a horse. Not like I would know... I like animals.. just sayin.... However I don't know if it is that strong yet, I haven't breathed on anyone yet... but just a warning. Besides the dinners, they have about 13 sandwiches, including some veggie options, (their veggie has Portabella, red and green peppers, zucchini, grilled onions, and Swiss cheese... um yum?), a large choice of side dishes as well as tropical shakes, (the drinks, not the involuntary body movement you have by the equator),  as well as hot drinks including Cuban coffee. Oh and a few breakfast options! Nothing on the menu is over $10, (at least not at the time of this review), plenty of options to munch on, friendly owner, really what isn't there to like?

I love that they have a little eating area on stools, and the décor makes you feel like you have stepped into a Havana quick bite spot! The big man and I came here on Saturday night whilst we were out on the town (a.k.a. on our way to Costco). We decided on the croquetas, and two sandwiches: media noche (ham, roast pork, swiss, pickles and mustard on sweet bread) and the guajirito (green plantains, steak, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions and swiss cheese) with the plantains serving as the bread. The media noche was tender, with succulent meats, and the mustard and pickles added something unique, along with the sweet bread, nicely holding the ingredients together, but flat enough to not be focused 100% on the carbs. I loved my guajirito, which was a nice combo of ingredients, with a nice mild flavoring. The only complaint I could see people having is that the meat is not flavored, and I could see people thinking that the sandwich lacks flavor. I, however, like that the flavoring is all natural, and not added with salt or heavy sauces. The plantains holding the sandwich together tasted like two big potato chips, not crispy, but firm yet flakey with that potato / banana taste. So delicious!!!! I love that they have plantain chips as sides as well. Although we both agreed that the croquetas were not up to par, the sandwiches were so delicious that they made up for them. Also, the owner was sitting right next to us as we ate and he is totally invested in making sure that his guests are happy. We took a bread pudding to go and ate it as a treat later on that night.

How the heck are they going to keep themselves off the American embargo of Cuba? So authentic that they must have found a way to flash freeze the food and have it illegally shipped to this place. Coming off my high of cemitas, 90 miles Cuban sandwiches are equally delightful. The minute I stepped into this place I wanted to see if my mom was back in the kitchen working. I mean just the aroma I smelled opening the door was instantly reminiscent of her cooking. I had the Cuban sandwich, a guava and cheese pastelito and a cafe Cubano. All of that was spot on to what I used to have frequently when I lived in South Florida. So there goes one thing I used to miss from living down there ... now what to do about the year long hot weather? The only knock I can give this place is that it is small and if you go when it is busy, you may end up having to take your food to go. Small price to pay when great quality food is available for less than what those fancy Cuban restaurants charge.

2008-10-23,5.0,"I moved back to Chicago from South Florida about 4 years ago, and in that time have only missed one thing about that godforsaken land - properly prepared Cuban food and coffee.  The offerings Chicago has had up until now have not only been disappointing, but borderline offensive (pickles and mustard do not a cubano make!) Not to mention that a few of the existing establishments were banking on the mojito crowd to be forgiving towards their cuisine. I recommend the Lechon sandwich; having tried a handful of items, this is the one I crave continuously. Is it the perfectly tender (and generously portioned) pork? That alone could carry the sandwich, but the sweet plantains are probably the clincher. The garlic sauce is just enough to keep the sandwich moist without being too overwhelming or saucy. This, paired with a frosty can of Ironbeer, is true comfort food. Last note, the owner is amazing. While in the shop last night, a young woman came in to pick up her first ever order from him. He was insistent that, should there be any problems with the food with it being a to-go order and therefore not presented in optimal conditions, she come back the next day to get a refund!

She doesn't like bananas so I ate her plantains. They were sweet and delicious. Soft with a bit of crispiness from the caramelizing sugars. It's a really cute place and the owner is very friendly.
