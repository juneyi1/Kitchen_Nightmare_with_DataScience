Stopped in and ordered two dogs with the works which is mustard, onions, relish, and the longest sport peppers I have ever seen. They were about 2/3 of the length of the hot dog. These dogs come with fries which you can see that they cut on-site. On to the actual food........such a disappointment. The skinniest hot dog ever on a bun that seemed a bit wet. The flavor was just not there. As for the fries.......a bigger disappointment. These were just greasy potato things that needed at least salt which they don't provide. To me, the sport pepper was the highlight. I just cannot see what is appealing about this place. I think because people may have grown up with these dogs they think they are the standard, which believe me, they're not. There are so many places that are better (and cleaner) than here.

2014-12-29,5.0,"In the world of Chicago style hot dogs, there are 3 places that set the gold standard for the all natural casing Vienna Beef hot dog- Gene and Jude's in River Grove, Nana's in Streamwood, and Original Jimmy's on Chicago's West Side at Grand and Pulaski.  There's these 3 places, and then there's everybody else- literally.  They are all Vienna Beef Hall of Fame members and for good reason.  All three places feature the ""other""  style of Chicago hot dogs, also known as the Depression Dog or Minimalist Dog.  This is not the original, drag it through the garden hot dog (i.e.  mustard, neon green relish, chopped onions, tomato slices, a kosher dill pickle spear, sport peppers, and celery salt)  served everywhere else.  This is the stripped down version of the Chicago style hot dog.  It consists of only mustard, relish, chopped onions, and sport peppers.  That's it.  And Gene and Jude's, Nana's, and Original Jimmy's are the quintessential examples of this style of hot dog.   All 3 places feature fresh cut fries that are wrapped around the hot dog to keep the hot dog warm.  But what makes Jimmy's fresh cut fries better than Gene and Jude's and Nana's versions are that Jimmy's fresh cut fries are FRIED TWICE.  Yes, you read that correctly.  They are fried twice, which gives Jimmy's fresh cut fries some extra crisp crunch.  More importantly, the extra frying gives Jimmy's fries some extra flavor, too.  And Jimmy's fries are fatter and bigger than the fresh cut fries at Gene and Jude's and Nana's.  They are crispy on the outside, and almost pillowy soft on the inside.  In the end, this is what makes Jimmy's fresh cut fries the best fries you will ever have anywhere in America, and the world for that matter.   Jimmy's all natural casing Vienna Beef hot dog is a little smaller than the version sold at Gene and Jude's and Nana's, but not by much.  It's excellent in every way, and you have to leave some of the fresh cut fries on the hot dog when enjoying a Jimmy's Vienna Beef masterpiece.  The place has been around since 1954, and it's standing room only.  There are no seats, and the best seat will be in the comfort of your car.  The neighborhood is pretty bad, but Jimmy's always has more than a few of Chicago's Finest eating either inside or in their squad car in the parking lot, so you will be safe and happy all at once.  Coppers always know where to get the best, classic, Chicago street food, and they identified Jimmy's as the best hot dog in Chicago many generations ago.  In addition, Jimmy's serves one of the best Vienna Polish sausages in the city at any given time.   The same family still runs the place, and they are ALWAYS there on scene doing what they do best.  They even sell Jimmy's t-shirts now for a mere $10.00 USC.  Places like Jimmy's are becoming fewer and far between these days, so it's important to celebrate them as frequently as possible.  Jimmy's has defined the intersection of Grand and Pulaski since the 1950s.  They are the ultimate example of the neighborhood institution, along with Johnnie's Beef in Elmwood Park and Gene and Jude's in River Grove.   And as always- NO KETCHUP at Jimmy's!  Jimmy's was one of the original members of the Vienna Beef Hall of Fame, and one bite into their legendary hot dog will prove to you why they are one of the founding members.  Good stuff.",0.9982,0.777,0.178,0.045,0.5925989345509896

Let's just be honest here.  You have to love a hot dog stand that publicly advertises ""No Ketchup Ever!"" on their t-shirts.  There is no doubt that Jimmy's is a dive and perhaps not for those easily frightened by an urban environment.  You pretty much have to eat in the car, especially if it is crowded.  Fortunately, they have their own lot and it is a big one.  Finally, they only have about three things on the menu, hot dog, polish, hot tamale. All that said, Jimmy's is a fantastic hot dog stand.  I don't know anything about the tamale, but the dog and the polish come wrapped tight with the fresh cut, straight out of the fryer french fries on top in a bag that will make you wonder where it came from.  It never says Jimmy's, and it could say just about anything else.  The whole thing is always to hot to eat right off so having a moment to enjoy the neighborhood is a pleasant treat.  Yes, that woman was probably doing exactly what you were thinking.  Don't look to long or she will come check you out too. Jimmy's is open late, has absolutely fantastic dogs and polish and the prices are very reasonable.  (Maybe it is the surplus bags they buy.)  And if you are worried about the neighborhood, I have seen a manger, who must be law enforcement somewhere, with his gun belt on.  I have been there many times after midnight and have never had a single problem.  Everyone is there for some good food, not trouble.  Give it a try.  You will not regret it.",0.9945,0.717,0.205,0.079,0.6066163375919473

The total with the drink came up to 7 dollars and some change. Which is slightly more than the Gene and Judes two hot dogs and drink total. Whatever. Walking to the car and got in, started to inspect my order. Fries are piping hot, look real good and the amount they give per hot dog is insane! Probably my favorite thing about Jimmys! Sadly, the hot dog bun seemed to be in the steamer too long, and the frankfurter had no snap per bite, and not as tasty.  To me, the hot dog tasted any other Vienna Beef hot dog stand, if it weren't for those fantastic fries. All in all, I was impressed. Great, but could've been legendary. To the folks at Jimmys, you guys need better tasting frankfurters! Cash only.",0.8777,0.861,0.088,0.051,0.7776515151515152

You can ask them to bag your fries separately if you don't want a squashed bun, I've done that. Yes, the price for the dog with that amount of fries is unbelievable.  The little Vienna dog goes down in no time and you'll end up spending most of your time eating those fries. If you are driving, you just might pick at the fries until they are finished. I'll eat practically any warm fry that has been cooked properly. Once it starts getting cold, forget about it, I throw them away.  Overall, I might eat the fries and they may be the best to some, but not a big fry person. I'd rather have two dogs or a double dog than all those fries. If your objective is to be filled up cheap, it works, the fries will certainly do it. The depression era days are back, Jimmy's is here to save the day.",0.9132,0.864,0.097,0.039,0.49719169719169715

2009-06-04,5.0,"I have so many childhood memories of eating at Jimmy's Red Hots, perhaps it was because Jimmy's was a family tradition.  My parents often went there in their youth and proceeded to take my brother and I to Jimmy's after a long day of fun in the sun or if we were suddenly craving hot dogs and really, really good (but oh so greasy) french fries.   To me, Jimmy's Red Hots serves the best dogs in town.  Sure, the fries will clog your arteries, but their fresh cut fries are the bomb.  Top is off with a large lemonade and you have a filling, but refreshing meal.  The prices are extremely inexpensive, for hot dogs, fries and a drink, you will be set back about $3.50 and to top it off you are out of there, with order in hand, in less than 10 minutes.  Why so inexpensive, perhaps it's because Jimmy's Red Hots doesn't invest in packaging.  There have been a few instances when I have received my orders in Burger King bags. Definitely, check out Jimmy's Red Hots if you are looking for a good Chicago dog, great fries and don't have time to waste. But a word of advice, don't dare ask for ketchup on your hot dog.  Not only is it a sacrilegious thing to do to a Chicago-style hot dog, there is a sign indicating to never ask for ketchup.

Jimmy's wins in my book for the following reasons:  1) AMAZING Red Hots made to order, with delicious seasoned fries that were fried to crisp perfection (Gene & Judes' fries were a little soggy...my buddy said the potato station might be ""rushed"" because the line was so long)  2) Absolutely NO wait. We went on a Saturday afternoon: in & out with grub in 45 seconds, no joke (G& J took around 20 minutes). 3) Jimmy's served the dogs in a Burger King bag, which made me laugh. I guess there's a variety of other restaurant bags they rotate. Hippies would say it's ""green"" because they're reusing. 4) An armed Chicago police officer was working behind the counter, not sure why, but it's always nice to see the force ""serving.""  5) Jimmy's is located in Chicago (G&J is in River Grove), so the drive isn't as long if you live in the city.

2009-03-27,5.0,"Woo hoo. Yelp review #100. I am going to step on some toes here. Jimmy's Red Hots has been in business for about as long as Superdawg [c.v.]. My uncle Willy [c.v.] was the person who first told me about this place back in the late 1960s. He loved its hot dog. But whereas Superdawg went the 'fancy-shmancy' route of selling the sideshow, Jimmy's adhered to the important aspect: The basic commodity. The menu at Jimmy's is _complicated_. I will explain it in detail. Try to memorize this. Here you can purchase =  Hot dog Polish sausage French fries Tamale Got that? I certainly hope so. (And there are also a lot of soda choices.) The hot dog is a size ten. It is cooked well, although it doesn't have a discernible snap to its casing. The onions and relish are chopped and fresh. You can also have hot peppers on your hot dog. (I believe tomatoes are not on the menu here. Then again, ketchup is unavailable for the fries as well.) What provides the major boost to the rating here is Jimmy's french fries. They are hand-cut, the medium size, and are cooked to greasy softness (even the odds and ends). I love them. They are also very, very salty. (YMMV.) There are _two lines_ here. One is at the north end of the business, perpendicular to its parking lot. (The door slams shut loudly.) The other is at the wider southern portion of the property, where you will likely enter if you came here on the bus. Both lines flow north to south; so if you opt for this second line, head for the center. If you persist at chatting on your mobile telephone while in the line, you run a risk of being skipped when it is your turn to order. There are no seats inside here. You can stand at a counter with views of the streets. The prices here have been reverse-calculated to total to easily-purveyed amounts. For example; the $2.27 hot dog and the 92¢ soda will accumulate to $3.50; two hot dogs are $5.00; two hot dogs & a soda are $6.00. A television program (local or national) is not going to send a camera crew here. If you want to see and be seen eating a hot dog, you will go elsewhere. But if you care about the quality of the hot dog, and you don't want to go into debt buying one, you will visit Jimmy's Red Hots. Transit options: The #53 Pulaski bus runs here all the time. The #65 Grand bus runs eastbound from here until 9:30 pm, and until 10:30 pm westbound. You are also two blocks south of the #72 North bus, which operates until 1:15 am every day.",0.9735,0.909,0.072,0.018,0.5228314028314028

2007-10-14,1.0,"Ew. Why do you people like this place? I visited Hot Dougs and decided it was so good that I would try some more local hot dog places. EW. Can I say that anymore ? The dog was like it was heated in a microwave. The bun was gross. ""EVERYTHING"" meant mustard , onions and sport peppers. What? Ew. The fries were beyond greasy. Not even good greasy, just dirty oil greasy.  All the guys that worked there just barked at you, ""TWO LINES , MOVE UP"" . I won't go back.  I realize if you've gone here while growing up its nostalgic. I just needed to review it honestly based on food and service.",0.8939,0.802,0.148,0.05,0.5545454545454546

I have been going there since a little girl.  When I came home from college, this was my first stop.  I now live on the opposite side of the city and I drive 30 minutes to get one of these.  When I'm mad at my husband he brings one home.  I can go on and on... I always order a double dog no relish.  The fries are to die for...Oh my gosh!  This is THE place to go to for a hot dog or polish. I've never had the polish but my friends and family love them.  Their hot dogs are never over cooked (lack flavor because they've been soaking in water).   You have go to go by here, you will not regret it!!",0.9236,0.816,0.127,0.057,0.5233333333333334
2007-09-02,5.0,"Chris H.'s review of Jimmy's is accurate to a T (tee? tea?  Whatever)!!! When I lived in West Logan Square and worked in the burbs, on the way home I used to drive down North Ave. every night and cut down Grand by Pulaski so I could get some Jimmy's.  I have had COUNTLESS discussions with people about ketchup on hot dogs and polishes and people seem to think it's normal for a Chicago hot dog to have ketchup!  These people must have never been to Chicago or are (again) Naperhole transplants from the burbs where food is bland and ketchup (in their world) is Tabasco. Jimmy's does have the ""we-don't-have-ketchup-so-don't-ask"" sign on the wall where you walk in, and rightly so.  It's very Soup-Nazie-esque like the Seinfeld episode...kind of like how you'll get cursed out by the ladies at the Weiner's Circle on Clark for not being able to order properly! If you carry a Goo-chee or Coach purse, don't go here.  You won't like it; and they won't like you (though they may like what's in your purse, unless there's no cash in it and said purse is all for show like many trendy purse-zilla sad Paris Hilton wannabees do).  But if you want a TRUE Chicago non-""Gold Coast Dogs"" hot dog, the trip to Jimmy's is worth it.",0.9614,0.849,0.119,0.032,0.6066358024691358
2007-07-06,5.0,"Best fucking polish you can find. It's in a little ghetto neighborhood but man is it ever worth the trip. The fries are delicious. I always get an extra order. I don't think I've ever spent more than 10 dollars at Jimmy's. And that's feeding multiple people. And are you looking for the latest movie releases? You can ALWAYS pick up bootleg DVDs in here. It's so freaking sweet. And the ""No Ketchup"" sign never ceases to amuse. You're in Chicago, folks. Putting ketchup on your dog is practically illegal.",-0.2718,0.725,0.132,0.142,0.48846153846153856

These fries have to be some of THE BEST I've ever had, aside from the duckfat fries at Hot Doug's.  Seriously.  I cannot recall a time in recent memory that such a delicious taste was on my tongue.  They must fry them in crack. The hotdogs are good too, I liked them better than the Polish sausage.  They're not huge but they come with all the trimmings.  This place is also cheap.  We got more food than we could possibly stomach for about $10.   Definitely check this place out if you want to get a feel for a ""real"" Chicago dog.  Don't let the neighborhood scare you.",0.8146,0.807,0.131,0.062,0.596920634920635
2007-01-03,5.0,"Jimmy's is the indisputable home of the greatest Chicago-style hot dog. By extension, Jimmy's produces the best hot dog in the world. My mother's been eating there for fifty years--my birth was celebrated by my grandfather driving out in a blizzard to pick up from Jimmy's. If you or any you know have never been, now is the time. Period. End of discussion.  Let us wax expository upon the entrance: invariably, a homeless person holds the door for you as you sidle into the line. Note the sign to your right: ""No ketchup. Don't ask: we don't have any. Don't even think about it!"" Kindly nod to the entrepreneur to your left, selling illicit DVDs of movies still in the theatres. Wipe your glasses as you approach the steamy tubs from which the handgun-carrying staff members draw the perfectly cooked Vienna Beef nectar known to all as the ""red hot."" Call out something other than ""with everything,"" and instantly all eyes burn with fury against you: declining any of the onions, relish, mustard and/or sport peppers is an affront--in my words and not my words alone--'punishable by banishment to the fucking suburbs.' Watch as those angelic, tatooed hands dump freshly lard-fried fries onto the wax paper; the effortless flick of the salt canister; the crispy cacophony as your hot dog is wrapped and deposited into the perfectly congruous United Airlines doggybag. Tip the homeless door-holder on the way out. Repair to a quiet location to enjoy your moment with the divine. Ahhhh. THAT'S a hot dog.",0.98,0.851,0.119,0.03,0.6455357142857143
