2017-09-03,4.0,"Came this past week on a weekday night at around 8pmish - and was surprised there were actually spots to sit!  After getting slightly bedazzled by their simple yet overwhelming menu, I set on getting the whole chicken (half seoul sassy sauce and half the crisp super spicy sauce) with a side of fries. Totalled to around $21 without tax, and I was sharing this with another person, so ended up being quite the deal! So much food...I was surprised how much they battered and fried each piece of chicken, I guess this is what they call Korean Fried Chicken, so different from the saucy wings I'd eaten before!  Seoul sassy sauce was a little too sweet in my opinion, and the fried outer coating was a little too crunchy for me (and much too oily), but hey this was my first time trying KFC so maybe thats just the way it is. The spicy sauce btw is no joke...I could barely swallow my second bite of the angry red battered wings, so definitely be prepared for the heat! Fries were on point.  Remember if you get the whole chicken, you are getting a whole chicken - so that includes the drier white meat portions too!",0.8182,0.882,0.084,0.034,0.47950937950937955

It's a small, casual spot in a Lakeview, sometimes it's hard to find a spot if you want to dine in, depending on the time and day you go. I typically get it to go, doesn't really alter the taste at all-still very crunchy and not soggy. I always get the Seoul Sassy and regular, highly highly recommend!! The wings are pretty big, def good portions, and they've been consistent here, never have one complaint. Buttt, in terms of parking, it's kinda in a congested area, if you could walk or take public transportation, that would prob be best. This place is a must!",0.9788,0.77,0.219,0.011,0.4024660633484162

I can't even count how many I had but I wish I had taken some to go! My friends enjoyed the sassy sauce very much but they were expecting the spicy wings to be much spicier- I didn't have any of the spicy ones. I stayed with what worked!

2017-08-31,3.0,Oaky so the fact that I'm Korean I had my skepticism about this place but I have to say it was good. I wasn't blown away by the menu but it was a decent representation of a traditional Korean street/fast food type of a restaurant. They're know for their wings so I ordered the Korean bbq with the buddha bowl. All in all decent food but nothing amazing personally I thought the wings were just drowning in too much sauce. Buddha bowl was good but I felt like I was missing something...... oh yeah that's right kimchi. You can't open a Korean restaurant and not serve kimchi . But too be fair this would be a good place to start for someone that's never had Korean food before and want to give it a try. One thing to note this place has bench style seating so if your not comfortable sitting next to a perfect stranger while getting sauce all over your face then you might want to go elsewhere.,0.948,0.778,0.156,0.066,0.5668154761904762

They all said the wings were pretty good so I'll give that a thumbs up even with my limited taste of the wings here.   Place can get packed, so if you're with a group, have someone maybe grab spots in the communal bench seatings they offer because it does get pretty busy and seating is limited.",0.9215,0.844,0.108,0.049,0.4705853174603174

Get ready to wait for a table if you want to sit inside after 5 pm, or really anytime on the weekends.  This place is always packed!  Also love the baby Buddha bowls.

What a difference! The chicken was crispy (aka Crisp!) and the sauces were really tasty. I got the suicide sauce and the BBQ. My mom got the Seoul Sassy. While the suicide was good, it wasn't as mouth burning as I expected. It wasn't bad, but I wanted more hot! The BBQ was my favorite and the Seoul Sassy was my second favorite. If you get anything out of my review, go with Seoul Sassy and BBQ. Get the BBQ hot if you want a bit of a heat challenge. They let you pick up to two sauces which is key.  The only downside is that the restaurant is really small and gets a little dirty quickly. It wasn't a deal-breaker for me, but something that was a little off.

I opted for the 6-piece boneless chicken strips, which honestly came out to be around 10 pieces (!!!). For about $11, this was a steal considering the portion size. I chose the Seoul Sassy sauce, which is a soy sauce, ginger, and garlic sauce. The crispy breading envelopes the chicken so that it all comes together in a green onion and pepper topped masterpiece. The more you eat these, the more the heat will come through and the salt, so have your water prepared. I appreciate how they provide sturdy plastic cups and a water dispenser for customers at the register.  My brother got the buffalo sauce wings, and when they forgot his order, gave him double his portion. Can't complain about that. These were tangy, dizziness-inducing, spicy wings. He really enjoyed them, and their fries are super thin, crispy, and delicious as well.  Free parallel parking on the street if you're lucky, but completely worth it.

It's two generous breasts (chicken...get your mind out of the gutter), battered and fried and slathered in your choice of sauce.  I like the Seoul Sassy.  Next is baby spinach, blue cheese crumbles, tomato, mayo, and the most excellent Atomic Sauce.  Marty's Magic Mushrooms, also with the Atomic Sauce, are an excellent starter. Seoul Steak Bowl is a great non-chicken  and is a strong competitor for BopnGrill on Belmont for the bulgogi and rice championship.  Adding the Atomic Sauce kicks it over the top!

My first visit I came mid day when it was empty and chatted up with the staff about what the best dishes are. The homey hooked me up with an extra wing, mad respect!  Their bowls are great too if you want something lighter. Big bowls and fresh crunchy veggies. I can't recommend the sassy sauce enough and you can increase the heat to your liking. The spiciest version has a great kick to it that builds up late. I feel like they could probably expand their menu with the concept even more. Korean pancake with a sassy sauce variant??? Please steal that idea. The only knock I could find was that the steak bowl was a tad bit too oily, I feel like it's missing something.  But that's not enough to knock a star because everything else is so good. (yelp still doesn't have half stars). Pro tip, if you're ordering take out just order from their website and pick it up. It gets very crowded in prime hours (add maybe 5-10 minutes on top of the estimate during peak hours).

The place isn't big and the tables are benches and community seating (which i wasn't a fan of at all, but I was at a table with some real rude and disrespectful people but hey). I had wings of course and I went with the Seoul sassy and BBQ. They were really good, both flavors (although Seoul sassy was a little better to me). I also had some of the Seoul steak bowl, it was good but could of been better (bulgogi wasn't the best to me)and they do offer like 5 different bowls and they all look good. Overall a really good place for wings in the city of Chicago (probably the best in the city actually), however they are nowhere near the best Korean wings I have ever had and being that I went to both Milwaukee and Chicago for this trip, they were last place out of three places I had for wings.

The staff is extremely friendly and gives great suggestions on what to order. We ordered a 10 wings basket and had half of the wings with Seoul Sassy sauce and the other half with Crisp BBQ sauce. My only complaint is that Crisp does not provide any sides with their baskets. However, $17 is a great deal for 10 chicken wings. We both thought the best sauce was the Seoul Sassy because it is a light and sweet sauce. There is a good amount of soy flavoring and it tastes very refreshing. The Crisp BBQ was also a good runner up because it had a good amount of spice and smoky flavor.

But it is also BYOB and there is a liquor store down the street which is clutch. They will give you glasses and a wine/bottle opener so no need to bring.",0.9378,0.76,0.177,0.064,0.6081481481481483

They're most famous for their fried chicken wings, but they also have bowls, burritos, sandwiches, etc. This place is really popular and can get really crowded. Seats are limited.  I've been here twice. The first time I got three chicken tenders (5.95) with the Crisp BBQ sauce. While a little pricey, the tenders were big and filling. They were fried to perfection with a Korean fusion BBQ sauce that is perfectly sweet/spicy. The second time I came to dine in. I ordered the five wings (8.95) with half Crisp BBQ and half Seoul Sassy, their two most popular sauces. The wings were so delicious and crispy. The Seoul Sassy comes with ginger, soy, and garlic and is subtly sweet while Crisp BBQ is a tangy sweet. They generously coat their chicken in the finger-lickin'-good sauce.  It was hard to find a table to sit at so we sat at the benches on the side. If you're visiting in peak hours I would recommend getting take out instead!

Ordered the whole fried chicken, half seoul sassy sauce and the other BBQ ($18 -12 pieces). I thankfully got to eat a BBQ drumstick before biking back. The meat was juicy and the skin around the ends were very crispy and flavorful. After getting home, I tried the Seoul sassy - definitely prefer this sauce. The wings were a good combo of crispy, saucy outside and juice meat inside. However, the white meat pieces (the majority of the pieces) were very dry and the pieces had more meat so the sauce was not sufficient. Also we ordered a whole chicken but each sauce flavor had 2 wings? Not complaining just confused what kind of chicken this is with four wings. What is special about their fried chicken is the sauce flavor and the thin, crispy outside. Of course making the idea meat either the wings or drumstick, but not the white meat as there isn't much skin or moisture. The white meat chunks could definitely be improved by being cut smaller so more area can be covered in sauce. Overall, this was pretty pricey for the quality.

I placed my order online and it was ready when I arrived- good thing I got it to go because seating in this place is extremely limited!  They were hot still by the time I got home, which is good. I got 2 sauces, the Seoul Sassy and something else BBQ- the chicken was immediately kind of dry and I thought they messed my order up because the ""sauces"" were more like a dry rub. The flavor was lackluster and underwhelming.  The size of the wing was great, which for $2 a wing, essentially, they should be this big! But the overall wing was just okay, that's why I'm giving 3/5.  The kimchi was excellent, spicy, and abundant! I really enjoyed it.

It seems seoul sassy is the most popular flavor but I actually liked crisp BBQ the best because I like my KFC to have a bit of spice to the sweetness.

2017-06-19,3.0,"I didn't love it. I think part of that was bad ordering on my part, so I'd try it again if someone asked me to go there.  I got the half chicken, sassy.  First, in what I believe is an effort to create uniform size pieces for even cooking their half chicken is more than 4 pieces. So that comes down to creative butchering (and unidentifiable pieces if you're sharing) and bones in bites you can't anticipate. It does create more surface area for the sauce though, and that's the upside. The bifurcated breast was realllly dry. I didn't finish those.  I read the wings were ""huge"". Well the half chicken is normal sized. Like a roasting chicken. So half is about 1.25# The chicken isn't breaded- not a problem for me but good to know going in. It's also a factor in why I could eat most of my 1.25# in a basket. (I got no sides. This was a taste test of chicken as I am on the hunt for the best fried chicken in Chicago. Sorry, Eater, Yelp etc, but I don't see how Crisp ranks so high) The Seoul Sassy sauce is tasty. It's a sweet sauce. If you don't like soy-based sweet sauces, you will be disappointed. But there are others to choose from.  On the table are some sauces too, but only one of the two housemade options was labeled. I didn't try them. I liked my sassy.  So yes I'd go back if someone asked me to. I won't seek it out myself though. And next time I'd opt for drumsticks only.  To the people who say ""but I only like white meat""... a) that's racist, yo. b) you probably also cook beef well done and pork to 165°, which means we can't be food friends.  But we can talk shit about people, and of course, ice cream.  So don't count me out unless you're vegan  Then I got nothin'.",-0.5746,0.804,0.093,0.103,0.6147953216374268

We got 15 wings (an order of 5 and 10) and split both Sassy Seoul and Crispy BBQ, and also got the steak burrito. The steak burrito is literally a small baby. It's huge. It's bigger than Chipotle burritos. If I ate the entire thing I wouldn't eat anything else the rest of the day. It was delicious though. I would definitely get it again, and also try the chicken version. It was essentially bibim bap wrapped in a burrito. Loved it. The wings are huge. It has the wing, tip, and drumette. Both sauces were tasty but the BBQ is saucier, and therefore I liked the Sassy Seoul better. They even throw green onions on top for a little extra flavor. My other sister had Crisp when she came to visit last time and raved about it and I understand why.

The Good ~ The Crisp BBQ wings had a really good flavor to them.  It was a good mixture of sweet and salty in each bite! ~ The Seoul Sassy wings had a good kick to it! Not too spicy not too bland. ~ The bathrooms are clean!  With all that sauce on your face that you can't lick off, the clean bathrooms were money. The Not So Good ~ It's a little bit inconvenient to eat and a bit messy.  There was a lot of licking of the fingers and sauce on the face. :) ~ The fries were just okay.  They kind of reminded me of McDonald's fries (which isn't entirely a bad thing since I love McDonald's fries) but I guess I just expected something different? ~ The Buddha Bowl was just okay.  I would stick with the wings rather than the bowl since I feel like I can just make it at home.  The portion size was pretty big though.

Don't expect your usual sauce flavors, they have a bit more zing to them, and are overall fantastic.

I ordered 36 wings (IMPORTANT: wing and drumette counts as one whole piece).  2 flavors: original and sassy Seoul sauce.  Crispy/original is my favorite of the two. It's very reminiscent of Korean bar food. It wasn't overly greasy and pretty crispy -- hence the name of the store (amazing. See that full circle?)  Seoul sassy sauce wasn't over bearing. The wings weren't drenched which is great. I hate overly saucy wings. Unfortunately, these wings didn't hit home for me. Mildly sweet and salty wings, there's a tang. Not much to it for me. Try them out but don't order a large quantity unless you like sweet wings.  Would I go again? MAYBE FOR DEM ORIGINAL WINGS only! Mmmmmmmmmm",0.952,0.807,0.156,0.037,0.7399159663865547

Seoul sassy vs BBQ is a tough toss up, but luckily, even just ordering 5 wings, the place will sauce both for ya. BBQ has a bit of the red pepper flavor that I enjoy and isn't that spicy and the Seoul sassy is sweet soy garlic. Both are delicious, but BBQ has a stronger flavor.

Reason why I liked the second visit better was because the last time I came here, I got the half-chicken and the meat was really dry, the fried skin almost completely separated from the meat. I guess their wings are the better, safer thing to get here. Definitely one of my favorite wing/Korean fusion places in town.

The BBQ sauce they use on the Crisp BBQ ones is smoky, sweet, and has a deep spice mix flavor. The Buffalo sauce they use ranges in heat from mild all the way to ""suicidal."" They don't lay on a ton of sauce (More on the dry side on the outside), but still have those napkins ready! I like to get the fries and onion rings as sides if I go for the Whole Chicken Deal. You get two sides and two cans of soda with that. Fries and onion rings always come hot, but are made extra awesome if you use that ""Alison's Atomic Sauce"" on them. Not sure what's in the sauce, but it would honestly go great with anything here.  There's also bowl-type and burritos on offer here, but I go here for a craving for wings, so haven't tried those.

What makes Crisp above and beyond the rest? For one, they are served Korean style, which means little breading - all the flavor is in the sauce and the seasoning. The lack of breading means no mouthfuls of grease that is typical of fried chicken. I got the Crisp BBQ sauce, which was EXCELLENT with just the right amount of sweet and spicy.

Although the bulgogi with the Seoul steak bowl is marinated in Crisp's sauce, I didn't find any essence of bulgogi in it. It was merely beef and rice.

Two main flavors you should go for: Seoul Sassy (tangy and a little spicy) and Crisp BBQ. Yes there are other flavors but really you only need to try these two. At first the prices seem pretty hefty, until you realize that each ""wing"" is AN ENTIRE WING (see pictures). My husband and I got 10 wings and the steak bowl, and we split that into 2 meals. Side note: the wings reheat pretty well too! Food aside, you need to be mentally prepared going in. It is CROWDED, tight, loud in the store. During meal times, count yourself lucky if you're able to get a seat. My advice: either take out, or be prepared to fight for a space at the table (literally).

I also tried their bulgogi burrito. It was ok.  Their side dishes like the radish kimchi and marinated veggies were good. They were authentic and reminded me of my mom's.  Since this visit I have ordered delivery from them. Two times, and the only two times, I ordered delivery, the wings were scrawny and overcooked. They were so overcooked that the meat under the batter was chewy and dry, like if you picked up wings that sat out overnight for 2 nights. It didn't taste like chicken, but just chewy chicken-flavored plastic. The sauce was also scantily put on the chicken. They weren't covered in the sauce, as if someone just sprinkled it, or tossed them in a bowl with very little sauce so it didn't cover everything.

As I mentioned, it was crowded and packed on a Sunday night, with a long line as well. Try to grab a table or share a table with other people, which is what I did since there were no other seats! Otherwise, you can just order to go which a lot of people did. It was a small restaurant space so it was kinda cramped in there. Food: I ordered 5 wings ($9) of the Seoul Sassy (ginger, garlic, and soy) and I also ordered 10 wings of BBQ wings ($17) to-go. The wings are freaking huge! These are not your baby wings that you get from B Dubs. They are double the size of a regular wing and they're filling! I only ate 3 of 5 wings because it was so big. I absolutely loved the Seoul Sassy sauce, which was sweet and sticky. The chicken was so juicy and the breading to chicken ratio was perfect.  Verdict: the space is small but it's okay to share a table with other people or take orders to go! The chicken wings are bomb and I recommend you try them if you haven't already.

We had a basket of tenders with all the sauces, and some additional bone-in wings and they were literally and figuratively the best I've ever had. Hot, spicy, crispy perfection of chicken, bone or no. The sauces were amazingly rich and flavorful, with the right combination of Korean marinades and fire to liven things up. Honestly, I am always a little hesitant to try these (sort of) modernist takes on Korean food. Like bulgogi tacos or kim chi fries or Korean bbq burgers (and wings are a relatively new phenomena, by the way). But of the places I've tried, I've been blown away by the sheer deliciousness of the flavor combos. Crisp is no exception and they truly excel at making excellent wings. In addition, we got Baby Buddha bowl and I was very very impressed by the authenticity of the flavors and setup. And the gochujang is spot-on in its flavors too.

2016-12-21,5.0,"Don't expect tiny wings because these are huge! One wing is basically the wing and the drumstick or thigh.  For wings, there are four choice for sauces but the only two that matters are the first two which is the Seoul Sassy and the Crisp BBQ. The Seoul Sassy is a non-spicy soy garlic sauce that tastes like a sweet honey glaze. Even though it is technically non-spicy, there is still a little kick to it which might be coming from the ginger. This is typically my favorite flavor at any Korean chicken restaurant. It's less saucy but mildly addicting. The Crisp BBQ is a sweet and spicy sauce that tastes like gochujang (red pepper paste). This one is definitely saucier and you might have extra spicy sauce at the bottom of your plate if you feel like dipping your fries into it. Speaking of fries, I love their Atomic Sauce which tastes similar to a thousand island dressing mixed with sriracha mayo.  Everything was super delicious but it can get quite messy eating especially since the Crisp BBQ leaves the sauce sticking all over your fingers. They have paper towel rolls on the table to wipe down your hands and they also gave some moist towelette wipes. There are two single bathrooms in the back to help aid in the washing hands department. Water is self-served and you get it from the water dispenser by the counter. Fun fact: they have bendy straws! The place is quite small and there are only about 3-4 bench tables as well as seating against the counter wall. You order up at the front and then grab a seat wherever you can. Most likely you will be sharing your table with other customers.

I was in town visiting the BF from Florida for a weekend & was too scared to venture out in the frigid cold for a night, so he suggested staying in & ordering Crisp. He raved about the wings so we got an order of those along with the Seoul Steak Bowl. Mind you, it was a Friday night on one of the first very cold nights of the year, so their phones must have been going crazy. They first quoted us about 45 minutes. After an hour went by, we knew something was up. We tried calling back to see if our delivery was on the way yet, but couldn't even get through after multiple tries.  After 2 hours and severely rumbling tummies, we were ready to cancel the order and order from elsewhere. Our call actually goes through the minute we decided to cancel the order. Crisp immediately apologized & decided to make our order free-of-charge & deliver it immediately! We finally got our food about 15-20 minutes after that call. I have to say the 2 hour wait was worth it for how absolutely delicious everything was. My Seoul Steak Bowl was dripping with sauce & I never wanted it to end.

I think I was just in love with the BBQ sauce because everything I added it to, I fell in love with it. The Seoul sassy wasn't as bold, but it was good.",0.9862,0.712,0.255,0.034,0.5968253968253967

I got to try both their buffalo spicy regular wings and their Seoul sassy which is a mix of soy sauce based. The wings came in pretty big portion. The Seoul tasted very bland and I had to dip them in the atomic sauce they had on the tables to enjoy them. The Buffalo was much tastier. I got their 2nd level which is called spicy...it was mild I would say. Their next level is called suicide but maybe you should get that if you want real spicy. There is also one level of crispness to the wings. Overall they were good not amazing, they felt different from other korean wings I had prior. The place is small, they have a couple of large shared tables and some seating by Windows. The staff was friendly.",0.9245,0.809,0.149,0.042,0.4276425954997383

We split an order of 10 wings and a small Buddha bowl, plenty for two people. The bowl was large enough and had enough veggies to make us feel like our meal was not just protein. They recommend 5 wings per person and that felt like a lot (depends on how much you eat I guess). We got half sassy Seoul sauce and half crisp BBQ. The sassy Seoul was sweet and more liquidy but still delicious. I would really recommend the crisp BBQ though because it was a little thicker and stuck to the wings better, so more flavor. Asked my friend and we both agreed--would definitely come back. Only down side is that there's limited seating, so it may be tough to accommodate a large group during busy hours. It seems pretty popular for delivery though since we saw at least 5 different batches of delivery go out while we were eating",0.9874,0.755,0.213,0.032,0.49296296296296305

2016-10-07,2.0,"Coming from a Korean who lived in Korea who loves Korean chicken wings, in the popular and standard way that they enjoy it there... Crisp fell pretty short for me, unfortunately. The chicken quality itself is great. Meaty, not dry, standard for what should be good. HUGE pieces. But the breading and coating were quick to get soggy. Breading was thin, no body. The sauces were also pretty thin, albeit still sticky; the soy based sauce was way better than the spicy (and that in itself is just... wrong). What should be the star, the sweet spicy sauce was way too heavy on the gochujang flavor-- just too much straight up gochujang, that really strong earthy flavor was too prominent. I could almost taste the clay pot. That sauce needs to be tempered with more garlic and sweetness to balance it out. On top of the chicken falling flat... they don't serve white radish?! What? That's like a staple, all you want while you're eating delicious sticky crunchy chicken is that crisp, sweet and tart, acidic white radish to cut the fatty and then make fried chicken sex in your mouth. Seriously, it was so sad, I got zero of any of this. I saw that they offered korean banchan but for $6 on the side, and uhhhh, no. We got the fried magic mushrooms instead and there was nothing magical about them, just your standard fried button mushrooms. Decent, nothing special, they don't give you any special magical sauces with it either, which I think would kick it up a notch, so we used the sauce that was on the table. The service was great though, the guy at the counter was very helpful and friendly. He even suggested I order my carry out order later as to prevent longer sogginess of the chicken (I understood very quickly what he meant after I started eating my made-to-order there, and decided against ordering any more to take home to my parents bc I knew they wouldn't enjoy it either). So... I'm a little surprised their name is Crisp bc I was lacking way too much of that at my first (and prob last) experience there.

I always have left overs which still taste great the next day. The only downside is that when I'm in the mood to sit down and eat out, I do not think of Crisp. I understand their space is small, but the picnic style tables are not the greatest. It's always hard to find seating when I've gone. That's actually the only thing that has stopped me from going the past couple months. I like sitting down outside of my apartment and enjoying a meal, but it's hard to do that when there is nowhere to sit.      That being said, the food is really great and if you love chicken you need to try Crisp.",0.9666,0.774,0.166,0.06,0.5218253968253967
2016-08-21,4.0,"The bird is the word! declares the awning of Crisp, your new go-to place for Korean fried chicken. One of the most memorable meals I've had near Belmont was the Korean fried chicken from Crisp. Only a 10-minute walk from the Belmont Red Line stop, Crisp is ideal for Korean fusion, whether that's the Korean-Southern fried chicken I had or one of their Korean-Mexican burritos, which all sound daaaank. On a Sunday afternoon, Maddy, Jeremy and I were having trouble finding seats, but the employees were genuine and courteous about helping us find somewhere to sit. They even gave me a free carton of sauce at the end of the meal, when I went back up to the counter to inquire about their miraculous Seoul Sassy sauce (more on that later). Maddy, Jeremy and I split a $16 whole Korean fried chicken, sitting in silence as we ravenously ate our meal. The whole bird was cleaved into pieces small enough to handle without me looking like a complete savage, piled on top of each other in a plastic basket. The chicken was fried to near perfection, gloriously crispy and well-coated in the Seoul Sassy sauce, made with the perfect balance of soy sauce, ginger and garlic. ASIDE: People seem to have mixed opinions about Crisp, comparing the restaurant's fried chicken to that of Dak, which I reviewed a few months ago. I've had both, and here's my verdict: Dak wins over Crisp for the texture and consistency of the fried chicken. Crisp's has repeatedly been a bit overcooked, resulting in a drier food product. However, Crisp is still absolutely worth going to because that Seoul Sassy sauce is BOMB. The flavor is 100% there, the perfect balance of sweet and salty.

The flavors were too sour/vinegary and despite looking like a classic bibimbop, did not taste like one. Minus one star. Overall though service is friendly, wings are amazing.

2016-08-09,5.0,"This is hard review to write, considering as of 8/7 they are no longer selling whole or half chickens. I am pretty upset, and wanted to give them three stars on those grounds alone, but in all good conscience, I can not, because this place is amazing.  A Korean fried chicken place no longer selling whole or half chickens..... ABSURD I have lived in Lakeview for 5 years and have ordered out and ate in here many times. Its absolutely fabulous. I always get a whole chicken, half classic crisp BBQ, half sassy seoul. I have never been disappointed.  But upon getting lunch there with my finance on 8/6, i saw the sign in the window which stated what i mentioned previously, no more whole of half chickens. I was genuinely shocked and confounded. How can a Korean fried chicken BBQ place, as well known and as popular as Crisp, stop selling their best item? When I inquired, I was told it was a ""supply"" problem; that they cannot secure a steady supply of the quality of chicken that they want, free of hormones, antibiotics, etc. I found it odd the person i spoke with didn't mention pricing as a factor. What he probably should have said was, ""we can't get the chicken we want at the price we want to pay.""  As a result, their solution is to stop selling their most well known, most requested item, which to me seems absolutely trump-esque debacle of an answer. Their menu online still list whole bird $15.95 for a 12 piece (with tax and tip it is usually $20); so I am not clear on what their profit margins are, but you would be hard pressed to find another bird in the city that costs $20. But many people, including myself, happily pay it because it is or was so good.  RIP Whole and Half Bird.",0.9816,0.737,0.163,0.101,0.568560606060606

Every part of each wing was fried uniformly--not too dry but also not overpowering. The sweetness of the rub was just perfect, and the skin was just crispy enough to give way when bitten into the meat inside.  I didn't think the Buddha bowls were all that special. They were like glorified salads with rice and a fried egg. Which isn't to say that they were bad, but I didn't think they were very worthwhile given the contents. It didn't taste much like a traditional bibimbap, so I wouldn't call it that--not all of the contents were cooked, and the majority of the vegetables were Western, not Korean.

My boyfriend and I used to live close to Crisp, so we never got delivery.  We would order in the store, wait, take it home and never have an issue (except for the one time my friend got raw wings, but the staff did a great job at remediating the issue...hence the 5 stars to 4).  We have since moved a little further away and have been ordering online.  I usually order the buddha bowl with brown rice, which has an extra charge of $1.50.  The last 4 times I ordered the bowl and paid extra for the brown rice I got white rice instead.  I was forgiving the first 2 times, but 4 times in a row?  Not cool.  The last time we ordered, my boyfriend got a half chicken and three of the pieces had almost no meat on them.  Again, not cool. When your order is right and you get good pieces of chicken, Crisp is great!  I hate to say it, but, given the last few delivery experiences we've had, our household is going to be taking an indefinite Crisp delivery break.",0.9678,0.84,0.126,0.034,0.4251002965288678

If you are planning to stop by Crisp for dinner, I would definitely recommend getting here as early as possible to save a seat for your party. There is not a lot of dining space inside of the restaurant: there are only a few picnic-style tables and a couple counters on which you can dine. Their wings are enormous and packed with tons of flavor. My favorite sauce would have to be the Seoul Sassy. It gives the wings a sweet flavor that is not too overwhelming or headache-inducing. In addition to wings, Crisp also offers rice bowls; however, I would not recommend getting them here. In my opinion, these bowls are not very good. There is simply too much rice and not enough vegetables in these bowls that makes them not enjoyable to eat.

Crisp was close and the photos surely looked delicious! Quickly made our way over and ordered. Between the 3 of us we ordered 15 wings (5 Seoul Sassy, 5 Buffalo, 5 Crisp BBQ) and the Bad Boy Buddha We came on a Saturday so it was pretty packed.. after ordering we waited around 10 minutes before being able to sit.  After we were seated, the food came out pretty quickly. Upon first glance, it looks pretty good. The Buddha bowl is basically a bibimbap with lots of veggies. My only problem with the bowl was that the rice was very soggy... it wasn't the normal sticky and glutinous rice that I'm used to in bibimbaps.  On to the wings! Crispy skin, perfectly seasoned, moist and juicy. Seoul sassy is such an appropriate name.. The sweet soy base with garlic and ginger really make it delicious.  My favorite wings were the Crisp BBQ though.. the bbq sauce had formed this sticky glaze on the skin which surprisinlgy was still crispy even after all the sauce was layered on top. Smokey, sweet and a little spicy. For those who know Korean cuisine, there I would assume that this base is gochujang (red pepper paste).. we also asked if they could make it a little spicier since we all enjoy some good heat!   The most disappointing thing and the reason why it gets 4 Stars is because of their buffalo wings. I'm a lover of classic buffalo flavored wings so I had to get some to try.. surely they could not be bad right? I found the wing sauce to be too buttery and acidic from the vinegar. Also, the wings were SOGGY! Don't know if it was just our order. Hey.. what should I expect ordering buffalo wings and a Korean fusion wing shop right?",0.9939,0.802,0.167,0.032,0.6135985288424313

My husband had the wings and said the Seoul Sassy and spicy buffalo sauces were equally good.  He didn't speak much while devouring the wings.  The wings are on the large side, and the guy working the counter recommended 5 per person (Crisp sells wings as 5 or 10-piece).  If you've got a big appetite, you'll be able to eat more than 5. We were here on a Saturday night, and it was uncomfortably crowded.  There were so many people packed into this tiny space that you couldn't tell who already ordered and was waiting for food, who was waiting in line to order, and who was just standing there.  There are a few tables, but they were all occupied.  We ordered our food to go and ate at a brewery nearby.

2016-04-20,3.0,"3.5 stars Having come from a location with more Korean restaurants than gas stations, I have been thus far pretty disappointed with the Korean options in Chicago. Heard good things about Crisp and wanted to see if it could fulfill the Korean fried chicken craving. Have had Korean Fried Chicken at the classic Bonchon among other KFC locations, and comparatively Crisp is good, but not any better I'd say. Additionally, ordered the  1/2 lb. of Korean vegetables and an order of onion rings to pair with the chicken. The Korean vegetables were essentially classic banchan, and included beansprouts, cucumbers, carrots, chilled spinach. For some small portions of vegetables we paid $5, which we probably we do again. Same can be said for the onion rings, which while tasty, at $6 an order were probably twice as much as I'd expect them to be.  In retrospect, would stay away from the sides next time. But what about the chicken? Got the full chicken which was  1/2 sassy Seoul flavor and  1/2 Classic Crisp. The Sassy Seoul we thought tasted better, but it could have been spicier. The classic crisp I suppose is their variation of a sweet soy ginger, but it seemed as if the sauce didn't permeate well through all the skin, and some pieces were clearly blander than others. Especially with the whole bird, some of the pieces of white meat can actually be surprisingly dry, though another dip in the sauce seems to remedy that.  Verdict: Good chicken, though the Seoul Sassy could be spicier and the Classic Crisp wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be. Additionally some pieces of chicken weren't as crispy as as others, though that might also be partly because we did takeout and waited a bit for the sauce to soften things up. Pricey sides that probably aren't worth it, though the Monday-Thursday Chicken Combo special might even those odds($22 for a full chicken + 2 sides + 2 sodas)",0.9338,0.883,0.08,0.036,0.5446843853820598

The seoul sassy sauce is delicious- savory and sweet! I personally can't justify only eating wings as a meal, so the baby buddah bowl was a welcome addition. I had four different types of veggies in my bowl (bean sprouts, carrots, spinach, and zucchini) and a fried egg with rice. Not the best bim bim bop I've ever had, but it's decent.

2016-01-18,5.0,"What a winner! We came in to crisp on a road to try a bunch of stuff on our day off.  I've been hearing about it for a long time, but never could convince anyone to come along - I should have tried harder as Crisp is delicious! There isn't a ton of Indoor seating here but tables are very wide and sharable between 2 parties of 3.  After ordering (quick and easy, btw) they bring your food out to the table for you. We ordered the Badboy Buddha bowl, 5 Seol sassy, 5 BBQ, and 5 buffalo spicy wings (everything but plain). The Badboy Buddha was very well presented and had a ton of different veggies - even though they all carry a similar pickled flavor they all have a special zing and texture.  Mixing in some of the Buddha sauce (a little like kimchi sauce) was tasty, but the white sauce was what really brought a ton of flavor to the party.  From the looks of it you can't go wrong for the price and taste on any of the bowls. The wings were all awesome.  They are huge too - so huge in-fact that my SO exclaimed ""Why did you order 10?!"" when they were bringing them to the table.  The orders are all wings and no drumsticks - but they include an extra piece of the wing that most places don't.  This makes your order of 5 wings much more like everybody else's 10.  I'm a bit of a wing aficionado and these had perfect breading, were perfectly cooked, and had delicious (though not too wild) sauces.  The sassy sauce is understated but sweet and tasty, BBQ is sweet but not really smokey (which works perfectly here), and the buffalo spicy were just the right amount of vinegar and spice - but if you like 'em really spicy you may want to go to the highest level. No doubt these are some of the best prepared and best tasting wings I've had. The drink selection looks really nice here with many sodas, flavored coconut waters, and it even sounded like someone ordered a mixed drink. With food like this Crisp when from on my list to way up my chart - I can't wait to go back for more!",0.9985,0.739,0.236,0.025,0.5296980255516841

Some things to consider: 1. One wing here is the flat and the drum, so like two wings anywhere else. Still a little more expensive than other places, though. 2. Seating - it is limited. Some picnic benches, some bar stools by the wall or window, and that is it 3. Of the sauce, I don't really find the buffalo anything too special, but I haven't gotten up the courage to try suicidal yet. The Seoul Sassy is very good, although not too hot. They have some spicier sauces on the tables, though. 4. If you go at peak hours, it will be packed. If you go at off peak hours, it will be crowded still. Get the fried chicken.

They have large plastic menus, with pricey options. 5 wings are $10. They do offer Yelper's who check in a whole chicken for $21.99. The employees are very friendly and helpful. The cashier advised me things to try as a newbie. I ordered the 5pc- 2 wings plain and 3 wings spicy. It took about 10mins for the order to be completed. I got them to go because the place was packed at 12:30pm with nowhere to sit. Got them to the car and they were nice and fresh. The wings are a decent size. The plain ones weren't anything special, they had a decent crunch, but no seasoning at all. The spicy were tasty and not too hot. But I wasn't WOWED. It definitely wasn't worth $10.

2015-12-27,5.0,"Crisp has been on my ""list"" for a few years now. After finally getting a chance to dine there I can say all they hype is well deserved. This place is AMAZING! We were there for lunch. There are only a few tables inside however we must have arrived at a good time as we were able to get a table right away. We did have to park a couple of blocks away as this is a busy area of town. The short walk was needed after all the food we ate. Since no one in our group had eaten here before they asked me to order. Yes! We pretty much ordered the menu. We had 3 orders of their wings, 2 of their boneless wings, a couple of bowls and a burrito. Oh my goodness. The boneless wings are pretty good but their wings are the best wings I have had outside of MN. I really love D Spot in MN as those are my favorite wings. The wings at Crisp are 1-A. My favorite is their Seoul Sassy which is an Asian type wing with garlic, soy and ginger. Their Plain Jane is their base seasoned wing which is still very good. Then their Crisp BBQ is their Korean BBQ which is a bit spicy with a little sweet. They also have a Buffalo sauce that we were not interested in trying. The wings here are giant. I don't wanna know the size of the chicken these came from. They are extremely crispy yet the inside is juicy and flavorful. We also had a couple of their bowls. The Steak and Chicken bowl. The steak is tender Bulgogi with perfectly cooked sticky rice. The chicken is all white meat again with white rice. Both of these were so good. My wife who does not eat much beef unless its hamburger was eating those bowls because the meat was so tender and tasty. The burrito we ordered was bigger than Chipotle's and had fresh crunchy vegetables to go along with some of that outstanding meat. We ate until we were full then spent time picking at the delicious food while we waited for the rest of our party to finish. We loved everything and have even returned and got some food to go a few days later. This is a popular place for take out too. As were were finishing our meal all the tables were full and there was a line out the door, so we did arrive at the right time. Service was fast and friendly.

The chicken was delicious, not too dry, amount of sauce was just right. I'm not a big fan seaseme seed, mostly because they use ALOT of it.  Service was good. You just go to the back of the restaurant and order your food. You can wait to pick up your good but I would suggest go to find seating because that's where you'll have a slight problem since they are so small. Food will come in a tray and you find a seat and enjoy.  The place itself is nice. Small and cozy. Seating is limited, you really have to just sit anywhere you can find a spot. Not recommended for big party but perfect for a couple. Shouldn't have problem finding seating for just 2 people. Also, after you are done eating you should get up and leave so others can sit. They are pretty busy, so people will just stare at you if you just sit there chilling.    Overall, food is good. Just didn't wow me.

2015-12-23,5.0,"Alright. This was the first place I ever had Korean chicken wings and at the time I thought they were the best chicken wings I'd ever had. However, my California friends would tell me that no, this isn't the best Korean fried chicken out there - I just haven't seen enough of the world yet. Well you know what, I live in California now, I've had the Korean fried chicken in California at multiple places, and Crisp still ranks at the top of my list. The other good asian fried chicken place in Chicago is Great Seas up on Lawrence, but their wings are a little different. They have lollipop wings that are delicious.  A couple of tips for coming here:  First of all, I always get a split of the Seoul Sassy and the Crisp BBQ. In my opinion, these are their two best sauces. The Crisp BBQ is spicy and the Seoul Sassy balances it out so your mouth doesn't stay on fire. I'd recommend that you get a split of the different types of wings so that you can try different ones. You can even split the 5 wing order into different sauces if you want - if I remember correctly.  If you're not a chicken wing person, you can opt for the whole chicken/half chicken. You get pieces of chicken other than chicken wings, like drums, thighs etc. They're just as good to me, though there is something very satisfying about eating a giant chicken wing. You can split the sauces for these too and try different sauces. This place is usually very crowded so if you come with a big group, I'd come either early or late so you can get a seat. Otherwise, you're left staring sadly at each other while you eat your chicken wings and sit apart in whatever section of the restaurant is empty.  Don't let your eyes be bigger than your stomach. An order of 5 chicken wings with other stuff, like the bowls and fries is usually enough for two people. These chicken wings are enormous.  For people who like boneless chicken, this is probably not the place for you. One of my best friends likes only boneless chicken and it wasn't nearly as good as the bone-in stuff. If you want boneless chicken go check out this place in Assi Plaza in Niles - called Do Re HoDoo DooRe Chicken. I know the name is funny but they do boneless Korean chicken right.  I've had other things at Crisp, including their bowls and their fries. I usually get the baby buddha bowl with beef and it's a nice side to the chicken wings, as well as fries. But let's get it straight, the chicken wings are the star of the show. If you don't like chicken wings and just get the sides, you will probably be disappointed with this place. But if you like chicken wings, I'm almost 100% sure you will greatly enjoy your meal here.",0.9978,0.802,0.177,0.021,0.6437724867724869

Crisp is crowded and it has counter service, but somehow everything ran smoothly. We had to wait 5-10 minutes in line to order, and we were worried about finding 2 seats.

I must say, the Crisp BBQ is delicious. A little sweet, a little spicy and with an asian zing you expect from Korean food.  At $9 for 5 wings, you're a little shocked at first. But, these are no ordinary wings. The wing in itself is giant. AND each wing is both the drumstick and the flapper, as well as the tip, leaving you with 2-3x the amount of a normal wing order.

If you don't believe, you'd have to try it for yourself. No, it's not anything fancy but I do love the idea of Korean comfort food that stands out amongst a city known for its cuisine. That's right! It's not the deep dish pizza nor is it a Chicago dog nor is it something from Thomas Keller, José Andrés, or even my mother's kitchen... it is something so simple yet complex in ingredients that makes the Seoul Sassy Chicken Wings my absolute favorite food [as of the moment]! The crispy exterior, juicy chicken meat, and savory-salty-spicy thin sauce is undeniably finger-licking addictive! The bright orange awning on Broadway St. in the Lakeview East area of Chicago is where you want to be the next time you're in the city. This cozy little restaurant offers a moderate number of Korean comfort foods your 'eomma' ('mom' in Korean) would approve, from their savory rice bowls like the Seoul Beef Bowl (Bulgogi with Rice) to another one of their popular menu items, the Crisp BBQ Chicken Wings. You can choose how spicy you want the Crisp BBQ Chicken WIngs and I say go for the 'suicide' spice level! It's spicy enough you'll have to pause between bites yet delicious enough you'll want to keep stuffing your face with Crisp BBQ Chicken Wings! Crisp in Chicago, IL is just amazing!

2015-11-07,4.0,"In short, the chicken wings rock. Ignore the buddha bowls and pretend they're not on the menu. It can be tough to figure out what makes Korean-style fried chicken wings so awesome. The often double-fried cooking. The light, super crispy skin. The size of the wing itself. Whatever it is, Crisp nailed it. At least, they nailed the texture. It's just as good as anywhere else.  The sauces, however, are a little limited. You really only get two options, the BBQ and Sassy Seoul (because you should never get the plain one). Both are great. But major missed opportunity on other flavors you'd expect from a Korean chicken wing joint. Where's the red-hot spicy version? The harder garlic with a kick? As for the buddha bowl, like I said earlier, pretend it's not on the menu. It tastes like rice salad (in the worst way). The veggies on bibimbap (the dish this is based on) aren't supposed to lack flavor. It's also not supposed to be cold. Ignore the bowl lineup. These aren't the bowls you're looking for.

Most people who visit a foreign country like South Korea for 7 days turn into an expert on the foreign land they visited with everyone back home. I am not an expert by any means. I never had kimchi prior to my trip to SK but loved it when I was out there. I tried buying a few caned types when I got back and have hit up several Korean bbq joints over the last 10 years and always order extra kimchi at each place. The kimchi at Crisp is what reminds me of the kimchi when I was in Korea.  Even though I have a beard and have been to South Korea I swear I'm not a hipster who is trying to talk up kimchi to be ironic.

That was really quick! We couldn't believe how big the portions were and we already knew that we were going to have leftovers. The wings were crispy and flavorful, especially when you dipped them with the atomic sauce, which is available on each table. The Seoul Bowl was also good and again I had put some of the atomic sauce in there to give it some heat. Yummm!

Ginger, garlic, soy, and green onions complimented the oversized crispy wings very well. I added a little of their atomic sauce to add some much-needed heat to the sweet, and it made them even better! Do not skip that sauce! The BBQ was fine too, but I'd go with the Seoul next time.  I also had the baby Buddha bowl and I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. I'm not a big fan of sunny side eggs, but mixed in with the rice and veggie mix, it was great. I did add a decent amount of soy and atomic sauce to give it some extra flavor. Along with a bottle of tea, for $20, the meal was a pretty solid value. I think the one thing I'd like to see is some fresh brewed iced tea. Especially with Asian food, some flavored teas would work really well.

One day while reading an online article, Crisp was ranked as one of Chicago's best place for wings along with my favorites. I immediately added it my bucket list of places to try.  While house sitting in Lakeview this week, I decided to try Crisp along with a close friend for the first time. We placed a to-go order of 10 wings (5 Korean BBQ and 5 Seoul Sassy) and 1 fry. I was a little nervous when we only ordered 10 wings and 1 fry for two because my friend can EAT. Sometimes I really believe this man has a bottomless pit for a stomach.  When we got back to the house and unpacked the food, all of my worries disappeared. The wings were very large and the fries were more than enough for two to share. We even had two wings left over when we finished eating! We both agreed the Seoul Sassy surpassed the Korean BBQ in taste. Yet the Korean BBQ had a kick of it's own. It was a bit spicy and completely different from my usual ""mild sauce"". Overall- Crisp gets a GO from me!

They did not have the texture of fried wings and was not one bit crispy.

2015-09-13,2.0,"The crunch has definitely gone out of CRISP... Not as good the second time around...I thought Crisp was much better the first time I went here, about a year and a half ago.  I thought, or, was it just my imagination playing tricks on me the wings were a little bigger?   This time around I thought they were smaller, tasted okay though, crispy and somewhat juicy inside, ordered the Seoul sassy sauce.  However it took much longer to get my order, had to inquire after I waited over a half an hour. The guy apologized, but when it was ready he didn't even hand me my order, had to maneuver my way through the crowd to get it.  Sorry I bothered you dude!  Annoying to say the least, glad I didn't put anything in the tip jar! Also, place doesn't seem authentic to me, not Asian-run. Couldn't help but notice the dinginess of the place too, that was the only thing that hasn't changed.  The ceiling even seemed too low, giving the place a claustrophobic feel to it.  All in all, was a lot busier though this time around, wall-to-wall people.  Had the choice of either sitting at a table, or one of the stools.  Luckily grabbed an empty stool.  Uncomfortable to say the least. About a week ago, I went to Crisps' newest competitor DAK on Granville and did a comparison.  Dak's wings were a lot bigger and also juicier and chewier.  Plus, Dak's space is newer, updated and better designed. No sloping ceiling.  Still kind of small though, but it felt more spacious than Crisp, a nice plus was it only had tables, no kiddie stools.  As far as efficiency goes, cashier/server brought out my meal in a timely manner and was very nice, no attitude.  Went here for lunch, restaurant filled-up very quickly, up to capacity.  This place definitely has an authentic Asian feel to it.  Gotta  go back!

2015-09-09,5.0,"My wife told me that she wouldn't have Korean fried chicken unless I took her to Ktown in NYC to Turntable.  Well on this trip to Chicago I wasn't going to pass up the opportunity to put up what is arguably one of the great KFC locales in NYC up to the challenge of one of the many award winning Korean places in Chicago. Crisp has won awards, sure.  Their titles of acclaim are on the front window and can be seen before you even enter the restaurant.  This place had collected a handful of accolades yes but how will you know how it is unless you try it for yourself?   Well I have to say that I dragged my wife here for one thing and it was Korean fried chicken.  We were staying in the Mag Mile area but I wasn't going to let a little distance get between us and having a try at a highly rated KFC place.  She as much as I have become in love with the KFC we were served in NYC.   We took the CTA Red line up to Fullerton and changed to the Brown line to be able to get off at Wellington.  From Wellington it's just a few blocks east to Broadway. The place only really has 3 bench type tables that fit maybe 6 people each.  Other seating is stool type at the front window and along the side wall where we ended up sitting because it was sort of busy in there. The prices you may think for wings is expensive as 5 wings are 9 bucks and 10 wings are 17.  It is NOT expensive and I will explain in detail why it's reasonable.   I had ordered 20 wings for just myself and my wife.  The guy there was telling me that if it's just us two to trust him and only order 10 wings and order more afterwards if we wanted more.  I'm a big guy and I can eat a lot.  This guy telling me to trust him and only order 10 wings for the two of us.  I had to go with his recommendation.   He went on to explain that these wings are NOT split in that the drum and flat are not separated and are fried attached.  So by definition these are WHOLE wings essentially what can be defined by others as 2 ""wing pieces"" in one big piece.  That explains that their 10 is other people's 20.  THEN you get to the fact that these wings are in fact JUMBO.  Honestly I have to wonder what kind of chickens these are to be able to grow as big as their pieces of chicken are.  These pieces of chicken were in fact not short of JUMBO as they explained on their menu as ""WHOLE JUMBO WINGS""... indeed they are that.   Think about it for a second.  I'm used to ""flats"" being around 2.5 to 3 inches long not 4 to 5 inches long.  Some of these wings are double sized.  Again, think about it... double the length is double the meat right?  WRONG.  Double the length is also double the WIDTH.  So what would a normal 2.5 inch flat part of the wing is now doubled in length, the width is also doubled so really Crisp's definition of ""WING"" is what can be as much meat mass as 8, yes as much as EIGHT wings to their ONE.  For the math inclined I'll break it down like this: Normal flat portion of wing I'm used to is for the sake of argument 2 chicken units.  These Crisp wings are roughly double the length AND width.  If you double the length add another 2 units.  The fact that they are about twice as wide, add another 4 units (2 for the extra width and another to to match up the extra length...) are you still with me?   To make your mind explode don't forget that their ""WING"" is not split so it's both the drum AND flat combined so if you take the above explanation and multiply it by two (flat and drum combined) that's freaking 16 units of chicken to a measly 2 units for a normal (wing or drum) sized wing hence the 8 to 1 ratio... My head is hurting to try to quantify how much you are getting to justify basically 1.70 dollars per wing.  If you can understand my math it's not expensive for the amount you get.  As these are both unsplit and jumbo at the same time.   Now forget the justification of bang for the buck and money to mass for a second if you will.  The flavors are over the top great.  We went with Plain Jane (x5) and Garlic Soy for the other 5 wings.  Normally I can't stand it when places go overboard with the sauce which is NOT uncommon unfortunately but I have to give it up to Crisp for keeping it CRISP and not drowning their wonderful chicken in sauce making the crispy crunch of their chicken wings go bye bye.  The sauce was just right, not too much, not too little but enough to make it look sort of try but enough to give flavor.  Kudos to that!  So many places I've gone for KFC think more sauce is better when it's not the solution. Crisp's chicken wings are not dry inside and are crispy and tasty.  The fact that the wings are not split are a huge plus.  I like the amount of flavor you can get by keeping them together.   Look at my photo in my review.  I took 2, yes only 2 wings and both of them covered my plate.  That is how big they are which is almost scary if you think about how chickens are not supposed to grow that large.

The kimchi was good but basically just like your standard kimchi, nothing particularly special, not too salty and not to sour. My main problem with this place was just the seating arrangement was very awkward and crammed. There wasn't enough space for people to stand, let alone sit, even though this is food that you kind of need to sit next to the people your eating with. The large cafeteria tables were very crammed together and packed, but I guess I went around dinner time on a Sunday. Maybe try to get delivery instead if it's going to be a popular time.

My friend moved back to the Philippines and he told me there is a Bon Chon in New York City. I Yelped Bon Chon in Chicago to see if they might have a restaurant here.  Instead of Bon Chon coming up ""CRISP"" came up.  I'm amazed that CRISP has been around for 7 years and today is the first time I have been there.  The wings are amazingly similar to Bon Chon and just as delicious.  If you haven't tried them and you enjoy eating great food you need to haul your buttocks (AKA Yo Ass) down to Bon Chon and try the wings.   My sister and I ordered a 10 piece order with 2 different types of chicken wings.  5 pieces of the Seoul Sassy.  This was a blend of ginger, garlic, soy, green onions & other spices. (Absolutely delicious). The other 5 were Crispy barbecue with a blend of American fusion barbecue sauce, a blend of spicy, sweet, prepared with fresh herbs & spices.   They also had a variety of condiments like Alison's Atomic Sauce (ancient family secret).  Gotta try this on your wings There are all sorts of other dishes on the menu which means I will definitely be going back to try them",0.9839,0.887,0.113,0.0,0.4926580621025065

My big complaint about Crisp is their furniture and set up. It is so dumb! They have these giant long, wide, heavy tables and then long, wide, heavy benches to sit on it's tiny in there. It's always crowded, so there is intense competition for the seating, and you have to sit awkwardly with strangers, which you can tell nobody likes. Once you've secured a spot on a bench near the wall, there is no getting up and you are trapped. It's just stupid. They should get some smaller tables so you can comfortably eat a meal. I hate getting food to go from here, too, because they put everything in styrofoam which is environmentally irresponsible. Went today, on a Monday at 2 pm, and it was a crazy shit show in there, so I can't even imagine how it is on the weekends.

I placed an online order to make sure my food was ready by the time I got there. As I paid, I asked my future husband if he still wanted to eat it there because it looked crowded. The cashier said with an attitude, ""We tell people we don't take reservations, so for you to place an order online and then sit here and eat it is very rude to the other diners here."" I looked at Mike and said, ""Well, guess we paid to park for nothing... Alright, thanks man.""  So, we left. I have no problem with the cashier saying it's against policy to place a to go order and eat it there. We'd actually done it twice before and were never told otherwise. But he didn't have to accuse us of being line jumpers. It's rude to others? The people behind us who were about to order would have to wait a good 15 minutes to get their food. By that time, we would have been licking our fingers and tossing the bones out. And we certainly wouldn't have been taking up any space after that.

2015-06-02,4.0,"Once upon a time, three girls trekked through the windy and rainy streets of Chicago on Memorial day in search of the most talked about chicken wings in all of the land.

Y'all, I can't tell you how happy I was to be able to try the deliciousness that were the CRISP wings. As a self-proclaimed chicken wing enthusiast, I would have to say the Seoul Sassy wings are some of the best chicken wings I have ever had. Maybe it was the sweet, salty, umami vibe I was getting from them or maybe it was the adrenaline rush from trying to find a seat in the tiny restaurant, but the overall experience eating at Crisp was fun, enjoyable, and exciting.  The guys behind the counter were very friendly and helpful when it came to showing us noobs what to order. We also got the fries and I would say they were okay - maybe equivalent to Mickey D's on a good day.

2015-05-26,4.0,"I lived in Korea for my all life before moving to Chicago last year. And there is no doubt that I love Korean food. I always went to look for good Korean spots in Chicago but it hasn't really been successful. Crisp, on the other hand, was one of the places that I told my friends about. There are a lot of Korean restaurants in Chicago but Crisp is definitely one of the restaurants where you should visit in Chicago. Their menu is very simple yet interesting. There are two big parts of their menu, one is Korean-style fried chicken and the another is Bibimbap(Korean traditional rice dish where they put rice and various vegetables, beef, fried egg and Korean chilly paste called Gochujang). For fried chicken, they have different sauces than what you usually get from regular chicken wing places in America. Seoul Sassy is soy sauce based sauce which tastes very similar to what you actually get at fried chicken restaurants in Korea. Grandma's sauce is basically sweet chilly sauce which also is very similar to how it is in Korea. Fun thing about their Bibimbap is that they named it Buddha bowl. Also, they have 3 different size which offers different kinds and numbers of vegetables. For your choice of protein, they offer tofu, beef, and chicken. I really recommend you to try it with beef while it's how normally we eat in Korea, but my friend who went there with me was vegetarian so he just ate it with no protein. He still told me it was best food he had in a while! I liked the food overall because it's still very authentic but at the same time they adapted Korean food to American taste. It has more of sweetness and saltines and it was definately less spicy. So I think Crisp good for someone who is not ready to get very exotic but still wants to try something different. It will be worth trying! Besides food, there were bad parts as they had good parts. I realized that the size of restaurant was little small for amount of people who were visiting. It was Thursday afternoon when I visited, but the restaurant was full of people and there were many people who were taking food for carry out. It would have been nicer if the space was little bigger. Although people working there were very friendly and nice, the restaurant didn't have any feeling of Korea. Since I am very interested in spreading Korean culture to the world, I'd expect such a good Korean fusion restaurant to show that their food is based on Korean food so that people can feel friendly about Korean food in the future. Maybe they could put more décor like Korean flag that shows it's a Korean restaurant or hang pictures of Korea with Korean letters!  Overall, I really liked that they had simple but good menu, and good sense of Korean flavors into it. For people who hasn't tried this place yet, I recommend you to try this spot to taste new sauces on fried chicken and I assure that their Buddha bowls will please you with new flavors and healthy balance!",0.9986,0.779,0.189,0.032,0.5067221967221968

Five wings here is more than enough for one grown man -- some people are full by their third one. The wings are huge! We tried the following wings:  BBQ: 5/5 -- Delicious delicious delicious delicious. I could take the sauce alone, pile it on some rice, and have a good meal. Sweet yet super-flavorful. The best of the night.  Buffalo: 5/5 -- Full of spice and full of flavor. What more can you ask for? BBQ was my favorite, but this made that decision very difficult. You cannot leave Crisp without trying both Buffalo and BBQ.  Seoul Sassy: 3.5/5 -- I definitely liked it, but it was nowhere as good as the other two chicken wings. You can't go wrong with this one.

The issues in delivery miscommunication range from simply not adding in a soda or extra sauce to leaving out an entire dish to getting the completely wrong order. My latest Crisp order, the delivery guy gave my food to the wrong apartment, and allowed some other tenant in my apartment to not only take my food but sign my credit card slip. I suppose the blame is split between the company they outsource to and the kitchen.  To be fair, I know it is a very busy kitchen they run, which is a testament to how great the food is.  Overall I would recommend Crisp, but I would recommend picking it up yourself so you can check your order.",0.9638,0.811,0.146,0.042,0.5484412698412698

Definitely dunk your wings in the sauces that are on the table, particularly the Atomic sauce. I've tried the fries in the past, and they were a somewhat lackluster.

I ordered a Beef bowl or basic bulgogi over rice for about $10.  My son had the same, and my daughter had the chicken version, while my wife had the bibimbap, along with 20 chicken wings (what they were known for).  So basically, this is an Asian fusion, Korean bistro that also has good wings. First on the Korean food.  Let's just say it's definitely very basic and simple.  The beef had no other vege (usually has onion and some shreded carrots), but all they have is bare slices of beef.  By the way, they were dried w/o any sauce.  Looks to be pre-made and sitting for awhile.  For such a simple dish, there were little flavor w/o the help of any other sauces that I had to add on. As the father, I usually have to eat the leftover from my kids.  So for my daughter who ordered the chicken over rice version, once again, it didn't have much flavor or should I say unique flavor other than the basic grilled chicken over rice.  For $10 a bowl, it's not really worth it. As for chicken wings, I would say this is what they are good at as the size of the wings are very big and meaty.  Forgot what flavor we had ordered, but it was tasty. Bottom line is that the Asian fusion or Korean food they have really is more like a 2 star.  Only reason for 3 stars was their chicken wings.  So if you love chicken wings, I would highly recommended.",0.972,0.884,0.093,0.022,0.5053876678876679

I do not have any thing to compare these wings to so for this reason I have to be fair and rate these wings at 4-stars. Of course, I can see from the other reviews that they are worthy of 5-stars. My niece said the wings are 5-star worthy. I trust her judgement. According to my niece, the joint was super crowded on a Saturday evening despite the frigid cold temps and service was average.

The actual restaurant is pretty small. And BOY it gets packed in there. But the chicken... I could eat it the rest of my life and die happy. Their Korean fried chicken is just amazing. The spicy flavors are good, but go with the Seoul Sassy. Trust me. I recommend the foodie's choice sandwich - perfect chicken sandwich. I've been getting in the bad habit lately of ordering it double - probably more food than my stomach was designed to fit, but WORTH. The chicken wings are awesome as well; probably the crispiest, crunchiest fried chicken out there that has so much flavor. Oh, and if that's not enough for you, the fries are thin and INCREDIBLY crispy. Perfection. Make sure to load up on the light colored ""Atomic"" sauce they have lying around on the tables - it's not too spicy, but full of great flavor.

They are huge to the point where eating 2 will make you full! My favorite is actually the Crisp BBQ for its smokey but sweet flavor. The Seoul sassy is more sweet and tangy so it's something I have to be in the mood for. Buffalo is pretty good too! I really do not think it's too pricey considering the jumbo size of the wings! Fries - The small is big enough to feed two people. By itself, there's hardly any seasoning on the fries but the dark red sauce they have on the table is the most amazing substitute for ketchup (but they have ketchup too). The red sauce is like a sweeter, less spicier version of gochujang which makes it not spicy at all for me actually. But the dark red sauce, whatever it is, is still mm mm yummy!

Only qualm was that we got delivery using Postmates, in which the fees and delivery was more than what I should have paid for. Anywho, boo & I each got an original bad boy buddha (bibimbap), one with beef and the other with tofu. We also got a half order of chicken, in seoul sassy and crisp bbq. I liked that they separated the rice and wasn't already mixed in with the bowls. I accidentally ordered organic brown rice for one of the bowls, and boy was it amazing rice, even though it cost more. It was great that all the veggies still tasted fresh and vibrant after waiting roughly an hour for delivery. Boo surprisingly enjoyed the bibimbap, considering he's a burger type of guy. While bibimbaps were good, they weren't outstanding and definitely have had better. The chicken though is where it's at. Perfectly fried with great crispiness outside without the chicken being dry. The sauces are what impressed me the most. The descriptions really described it perfectly...a little spicy, smoky, sweet, ginger and soy notes. I usually don't care for sweet and am all about the spicy/salty but they really did it right here. Also feel like Crisp is very good bang for your buck, as the original Buddha bowl or a half order of chicken is very satisfying for one person and costs right under or at $10.

I met a colleague for lunch here at her suggestion and I had trouble controlling myself. The sweetness in whatever they do to it is detectable but just vaguely out of reach - it is a note that is realized for a moment, and then its gone in a swallow of savory, perfect chicken. I ate bite after bite, chasing that note.  UFC in Queens has some of that pleasure, but not to the same degree.  The informality of the place is a plus.

I made the (happy) mistake of getting ten for myself (half Seoul Sassy, half hot buffalo), and I had plenty of leftover food to snack on later. I was very happy with my sauce choices, but used the atomic sauce on the side to give the Seoul Sassy an extra kick. My favorite thing at Crisp has to be the Not So Common Crisp. With the hot buffalo sauce, it is the best spicy fried chicken sandwich I've had, and I fully intend to try it with every sauce. For how popular this place is, there isn't a ton of seating, and when dining in, you tend to wait a while for the wings.

I like my Korean style wings crispy and sticky from the sauce, to me, these didn't seem to have enough Sassy sauce on them. Looking over at my gal JW's chicken, her's seemed to have lots of sticky sauce to it, so maybe mine just got a little ignored in the kitchen.  No matter, there are other sauces on the table to add a bit of flavor and I added a bit of the hot Buddha sauce and it suited me just fine.  JW shared some of her kimchi with me and it was very good too, crispy, spicy, tangy.

On this particular trip to Chicago, I stalked one of few people I follow, Jeffrey C's Chicago reviews.  I basically at least considered anything he rated a 5 star.  One of my other good friends Alexander W's 5 star review confirmed the visit. It's a decent ways away from our hotel but luckily it was pretty close to a rail so the trip out wasn't bad. When you walk in, it's a small restaurant with mainly family style tables and a few spots along the walls of counter space.  You order first then look around for a seat.  It just works out that by the time you get your food a spot usually opens up.  Most of the locals do take it to go which helps. We ordered 10 of the whole jumbo wings, and crisp bbq and seoul sassy as the sauces.  I recommend getting both sauces so that you can alternate wing flavors.   I enjoyed both a lot, you can't go wrong either way because the wings are fried really well.  Crispy and not greasy.  We also ordered an original bad boy buddha, which was their version of bi bim bap, we added beef to the bowl.  It was good, but definitely not a MUST have.  So make sure you get the chicken and you won't regret it.",0.995,0.802,0.198,0.0,0.5515849673202614

It's often a challenge ordering at these fusion places, you never quite know which ingredients and flavors will be retained in the dish. I enjoyed my meal though.

2014-04-29,5.0,"As other reviewers have commented, the place is a bit cramped, and surrounding conversations can be loud. Don't come here for a first date, or an important business deal closing. Come here to get down on some wings. An interlude on gluten-free issues follows, so you may skip this paragraph if that doesn't matter to you. I'm gluten sensitive, so my first question was about the gluten-free nature of the wings. Here's what I learned: the wings have a rice-flour based batter (yes, GF!); the wings are not cooked in a dedicated fryer, so there can be contamination. Cut to the chase, if you have Celiac disease, I'd go the safe route and avoid them, but if you just have a sensitivity and can tolerate some contamination due to the likes of some errant onion ring batter then its on to the sauces. The only GF sauces are their Buffalo varieties (mild, spicy, suicide), of which I chose the spicy. All others contain soy sauce, thus some amount of wheat. I also ordered the Baby Buddha with beef, which can be gluten free as long as you avoid some of the sauces on the table (the staff was helpful in letting me know what was safe). That's what I ate, so I won't comment on the GF safety of other items, as I don't know. The review: Food ordered: 10 wings, half with spicy Buffalo (GF), and half with the Seoul Sassy (I think, those were for my friend, not GF), and the beef Baby Buddha (bi bim bap). One note, 10 wings here = 20+ wings at most places because Crisp give you the whole wing, end piece and all. Had we known this we'd have halved our order (wait, am I complaining about getting to eat more of these wings???) Frankly, the bi bim bap was good, but not great. I'd have been very happy to eat it on its own, and would have recommended the place to others on that alone. The complicating factor was the wings, which made the bap seem underwhelming due to their superb nature. So, I won't bad mouth it. The veggies were tasty, the beef cooked well, the egg was perfectly runny in the yolk, and the rice made an excellent canvas for the flavors. I added some of the different sauces (sparingly, due to most not being GF), and I really liked their flavors. (Note, I didn't mix sauces, just tried bits of each). If you can't already tell, I think the wings are the star of the show. I ordered mine with the spicy Buffalo sauce, but I think I'd have been happy with the sauce on the side in order to preserve the crispiness of the wings. The sauce was certainly tasty, but it definitely toned down the crunch. That said, the wings were still much crispier than wings I can usually find. I tried my friend's Seoul Sassy (not GF) wings, and they maintained a much better crunch, and I loved the flavor of the sauce. Also, the meat on the wings is both substantial and tender. My friend and I basically spent the whole meal in awe of how good the wings were. Further evidence? Okay. This is completely anecdotal, but the people sitting next to us had driven in from 45 minutes south of Chicago, on a Monday at 7 PM, to eat these wings. That is the type of the commitment that only things like religion and college sports fandom engender. Price: Totally reasonable. For two people, we had 10 wings (remember, more like 20), two orders of the bi bim bap, and I got a soda. That came to $37.",0.9985,0.815,0.159,0.026,0.5578373015873016
2014-04-27,5.0,"Coming from someone who has no idea what traditional Korean food or flavors tastes like: 5 stars. This same person, however, is a grand lover of wings and this place is wing paradise.  I've only been to Crisp once, but the Seoul Sassy wings haunt my dreams. I ordered I believe ten of them and managed to get down about 4. I completely did not expect how large these wings were going to be (this coming from someone who eats 20-30 on 25 cent wing night at Finley Dunnes or Redmond's).  These wings are perfectly crispy, the chicken meat is tender, and the sauce is so delicious. My roommate ordered the BBQ version and those were great also, I just liked the slightly less sweet and more complex Seoul Sassy myself.  I can't speak to the bibimbop, but I can say that the people who work here are very nice and the atmosphere is laid back and fun. It's clear that this is a place where people just wander in with friends for good food without any of the need for social graces that come with going to places with waiters. That means, that while there are big picnic style tables to sit down at inside the restaurant, everyone (takeout and eating in) orders the same way: go up to the register, put in your order, wait for your name to be called.

2014-03-08,4.0,"I've been a huge fan of Crisp since they opened their doors and it's amazing to see that the quality of the food and the customer service has not diminished in any way.   My all-time favorite menu item at Crisp use to be the Seoul Steak Sandwich (Korean beef, sautéed mushrooms, grilled onions, shredded jack cheese, mayo, lettuce and tomato), which was so good my tongue would do cartwheels after every bite. However, I don't see it on the menu anymore so I'm not sure if they still have it...maybe I should do the normal thing and ask!   The chicken wings are definitely a must try when you visit Crisp. I like getting the wings with the Seoul Sassy sauce. It's definitely finger licking good.   If you like chicken sandwiches you can choose between the Not So Common Crisp sandwich and the Foodie's Choice Crisp. The main difference between the two is that the Foodie's Choice Crisp comes with baby spinach, bacon, bleu cheese crumbles and atomic sauce whereas the Not So Common Crisp has American cheese and no bacon. I recommend the Foodie's sandwich because I'm a bacon lover.   Crisp also has Buddha Bowls, but I've never tried those so I can't speak to how good/bad these are. I can say that my friend who is a picky eater ALWAYS gets the Original Bad Boy Buddha Bowl.   All said and done I am a huge fan of Crisp, but I'm giving it 4 stars because I hate the communal tables.

Seoul sassy = awesome sauce. Enough said. Their eponymous chicken leaves nothing to be desired with the satisfying crunch you get from every bite. This is probably as good of KFC you'll find stateside, certainly in the Midwest. I have mixed feelings on the size of the wing. I like that the wings are hefty and meaty, but it can be a little overwhelming to eat something so large when it's covered in sauce, even if it is awesome sauce.

I ordered 5 wings with the homemade Seoul Sassy sauce and a side of Korean pickles vegetables, and eagerly waited, mouth watering in earnest. Fried chicken is one of those things worth waiting to be freshly cooked, so a ten minute wait was more than acceptable. Now, to the chicken. The sauce, while tasty, was not unique from others at Asian fusion restaurants. The chicken sure was juicy, but the batter was just off. A little too thick and slightly overlooked, the batter was heavy and almost brittle- far from the perfection of Cleveland's Hot Sauce Williams (but that's a review for another page!). The vegetables were very disappointing, as they were over seasoned with copious amounts of salt and didn't really resemble the traditional preparation.

Had both Crisp BBQ and Seoul Sassy wings AND a Buddah Bowl I definitely do not suggest getting all of this food at once unless you're sharing and prepared to have TONS of leftovers.

It was decently priced at 8.95 for a giant portion, and the service was extremely fast and efficient because less than five minutes after I ordered, the food was ready! Now, these wings are huge and my favorite part are the wing tips, which I'm glad they don't trim off. The Seoul Sassy is reminiscent of teriyaki sauce for me. The flour coating for the chicken is very thin (unlike Harolds, for example!) so it lives up to its namesake. I didn't notice the chicken to be particularly juicy or dry either way, to me it was just good chicken. Gotta love that connective tissue, hey, what can I say? I had 3 wings and were already full, so I would say 5 wings is a generous portion. The french fries are a large portion as well, even when you order a small, and very nice and tasty.

Given the location in Lincoln Park close to Diversey on Broadway, there is lot and I mean a lot of foot traffic. Thanks to extreme cold weather, it was not as packed as it usually gets. The menu is very straightforward. You come here either for the fried chicken or the american version of BiBimBop. I had both. For the fried chicken we tried the Seoul Sassy and Crispy BBQ and they were excellent with and without the sauces on the table. The sauces I like were the one which said Buddha on it and it tasted more like chilli BBQ and the other one is more like mayo slept with Sriracha.  We each had the baby Buddha bowl and that itself was huge. The veggies were excellent and the rice was well cooked and moist. Next time, I may try the bigger bowls but if it were me alone, I will just try all the wings and go home a happy man. This place did look like it was BYOB. The prices are reasonable as well and for the quality and quantity, you get a lot of bang for your buck. Street parking can be a pain but I lucked out. Best way to get here is the L.

Sad days. But when you simply don't have access to fabulous fried chicken, sometimes you just have to settle. I came here with a party of 5 and we split an order of 10 wings and each had a bad boy buddha with the exception of an order of a korean taco. We all decided that after the meal we should've gotten ourselves just the chicken. Even though the bi bim baps were quite good, the fried chicken was just so unique and flavorful that we wished we had more. I was able to try one of the crisp bbq and the buds buffalo. First off these wings were fried perfectly and are infused with sauces. The buds buffalo was pretty good but the crisp bbq was fantastic.

I'm a fan, and the food serves as a wonderful way to absorb last night's debauchery sitting in my stomach. Though overpriced, the benefit of the greasy joy has outweighed the cost of shelling out a few extra bucks.  However, I gripe in this instance. I just ordered 6 chicken tenders, a large fry and a Big Boy Buddha Bowl for delivery. 25 minutes later, I get a call from the delivery guy and go and grab the grub. I anxiously rip open the bag and prepare myself for a hangover-curing, grease-filled meal.  I take out the chicken tenders and they look delicious, those were fine. I pull out the fries and it's a different story. Every single fry in the bag was soggy and ..moist. Crisp? No, the opposite. I then pull out the Big Boy Buddha Bowl and it's cold. The rice is next, which was so soggy that it looked like a Chinese food container full of mashed potatoes.  I usually just wing it in situations like these, so I threw the fries in the oven and the Buddha Bowl in the microwave. The rice, unfortunately, was unable to be revived.  I like Crisp, I really do. But if I'm going to pay $32.49 (+$4 tip) for a bag of fries, 6 chicken tenders and a bowl of vegetables, then I'd strongly prefer that they are cooked properly.",0.9712,0.836,0.132,0.032,0.43463203463203454

2013-10-03,1.0,"After hearing about this place time and time again from a friend whose opinion & palette I truly trust - we finally got a chance to order from here. Since we're actually 2 blocks outside of their posted $3 delivery range -   I was quite pleased to learn they'd deliver to us for a slight surcharge of $2 ($5 total for delivery). We were a big group so I ordered 3 chickens, but since I didn't know the sweetness or spice factor of the sauces - i decided to order two chickens plain with the sauce on the side and only one with sauce on it.  The order arrived timely, though I was a bit annoyed that my delivery instructions weren't followed with regards to the door to deliver to - Of course this wasn't a surprise since the delivery guy was also missing the charge slip for me to sign - so I basically had to write a note on the back of a piece of paper he was carrying telling them they could charge my card.  The delivery issues were a little annoyance that could have been shrugged off quickly had everything been good within the bags. Alas - upon bringing the bags upstairs to our house and unpacking them - we discovered we had no sauce. I checked the order form - the sauce was listed.  I phoned Crisp and informed them that part of the order was missing.  The guy I spoke with was the same one who had taken my order, and he apologized and said he didn't know how fast he could get the sauce to us but would request it.  We said ok, we'll wait - this was fine since our two orders of french fries were a soggy, steamed mess and we'd fired up our oven to crisp them back to life - we had time to wait. About ten minutes later Natalie called back from Crisp to tell us that she would not be able to send over our sauce.  She instead offered us a credit of $5 on a future order - To which we replied: we were not interested in a future order because we aren't very impressed with the rather dry plain chicken we received (nor the soggy fries ... though they did return to life rather nicely after 15 minutes in the over - perhaps they are best eaten at the restaurant).. My husband, son and I are all long time food service veterans and we were pretty shocked at the sad state of Crisp's customer service.  We understand glitches occur - bad nights happen.  You don't get all these great reviews or stay in business by  delivering  dry chicken repeatedly - but you won't have a chance to ever deliver a good chicken to my house because the way I was treated as a very good paying customer ($100 for 3 chickens, 3 buddha bowls & 2 orders of fries --- I think that's a fairly substantial order & a good potential customer - I know that Richie Melman would think so). So, if you're thinking of ordering from here - I'd say that there are lots of Korean chicken options and definitely lots of buddha bowl type Asian places where the management will value and appreciate you as a paying customer so I recommend rewarding those establishments with your hard earned dollars and skip Crisp - you can do better.",0.9873,0.776,0.138,0.086,0.5173809523809525

I'm not even sure the chicken at Crisp goes through the signature ""double fry"" that defines Korean Fried Chicken. But that's OK. Because Crisp is still dang delicious. If anything, Crisp tastes more like American KFC, only dunked in some awesome ""Seoul Sassy"" sweet soy-based sauce that goes oh so well with your favorite bi bim bap meat. Which is to say, it tastes awesome. The wings are huge, so don't go ordering 10 thinking you're getting yourself a wimpy platter of Buffalo Wild Wings limp-flighted pieces. A ""piece"" literally means the wing and the drum, so plan accordingly. The bi bim bap bowls (known as ""Buddha Bowls"" at Crisp) are surprisingly underrated, and a two-person meal consisting of both a bowl and some wings provides a nice varietal mix. It makes sense to get the Buddha Bowl (consisting of a vegetable medley) and add on the meat rather than just going for the meat bowl outright. You've got plenty of white with the wings, why not add some vegetarian color to your life? Also, fried egg on the Buddha Bowl equals YES. As for the drink of choice? Tahitian Treat.

The tastes were sweet and the crisp bqq had a bit of a kick to it, but not super spicy. The Buddha bowl was your regular run of the mill bibimbap, the rice was a little clumpy for my liking. I also got the beef added to it, and it was actually good.  Overall good eats, but not a WOW factor. Service was friendly and it's a cool atmosphere.

You can buy a jar of Atomic sauce, but it's so good you might find yourself putting it on everything.  Buy the big jar.

They promised within the hour and they made it just in time. $5 is pretty steep for one and a half miles though. I would have walked there if I didn't have Lollapalooza to get ready for. Food: The quality and portions are there. I had a Bulgogi Beef Bowl with an egg on top with extra meat.  I usually order extra meat otherwise they give you way too much rice and not enough beef. The quality of the beef is up there, but I haven't exactly experienced top class Korean Beef yet. It is not to sweet with a balanced amount of seasoning with tender meat. I like it! The rice is also very good quality, but I don't know what country the rice comes from, I still can't tell the difference between Japanese and Korean rice. As a rice eater my whole life, the rice here definitely makes me happy. The fried egg was pretty blehhh. Blandest egg of my life sadly. I really enjoy this dish though, and it will satisfy the hunger beast.  The Seoul Sassy fried chicken was a new experience for me. I really enjoyed the seasoning, but I feel the quality of the meat is not up to par with most respectable chicken establishments.

2013-08-14,5.0,"My boyfriend and I just moved to Chicago and we had heard great things about Crisp so naturally, we had to go check it out.  The fried chicken did NOT disappoint. First, I highly recommend visiting between Monday-Thursday with a friend/significant other because they have a $20 deal and you get a whole chicken with choice of 2 sauces, 2 sides, and 2 drinks.  Keep in mind that this is probably enough food to happily feed 4 people so if there's just two of you, prepare to be stuffed. When we ordered a 'whole chicken,' I thought maybe it would come out like a rotisserie chicken but it's actually large pieces of breaded and fried chicken (breasts, wings).  I don't know what I was thinking...  Anyway, the chicken is perfectly crisp (duh) and incredibly juicy!  We ordered the BBQ sauce and the Seoul Sassy.  Personally, I thought the BBQ was a little on the spicy side which my bf enjoyed.  As expected, I LOVED the Seoul Sassy - ginger, soy, and all around deliciousness.  The BBQ sauce was definitely thicker and his half of the chicken was more sauced up.  I wish I had gotten more sauce but you have to pay for that. For our sides, we ordered the kim chi and the white rice.  The kim chi wasn't that good - We only ate a couple of bites and tossed it.  I don't think it was very authentic.  My boyfriend enjoyed the white rice but I wasn't a big fan.  As a rice-loving Asian, I thought it was clumpy and not in the good sticky-rice kind of way.  It just seemed like it was steamed with way too much water.  Oh well, we didn't come for the side dishes.  Next time I'll order the onion rings because they looked huge and, you guessed it, crisp. While we were there, we overheard another diner say, ""How could anyone be a vegetarian?!""  My thoughts exactly. Tip: Do NOT come here on a first date because you will absolutely get messy - As in finger-lickin-sticky-face-I'm-a-carnivore messy.  Enjoy it and bring a wet wipe!",0.9892,0.804,0.144,0.052,0.5500373482726423

An aggregate rating of 4 stars after that many reviews was really impressive, which was why we decided to stop by after yelping for a place to eat in the neighborhood.  Crisp is also the first Korean restaurant I have been to that eliminates most Korean sounding names from the menu. Bibimbap? It's called Buddha Bowl here; Bulgogi? It's in the Seoul Steak Bowl; Ban Chan? The People's Choice Greens! Ok, I wasn't bothered by the menu as much as the hubby who has spent a couple years in Korea, but the lack of Korean sighting in the restaurant did send chills down my spine. So a Baby Buddha Bowl (sub brown rice for $1.50 extra) for me, a Seoul Steak Bowl for him, plus five whole wings to share. My ""bibimbap"" was plain, there was no sauce in or on the side of my bowl. The sunny-side up egg was lukewarm--poor thing must have been sitting there while the wings were being cooked. His ""bulgogi"" was sliced into very small thin pieces, very frustrating for someone who prefers bigger pieces of meat (which Bulgogi tends to be). He likened the taste to a teriyaki bowl.  Now the wings: they were whole wings (albeit on the bony side), which was not new to me since I had quite a few of them in the south. I am not a wing person, but would order them once in a while in a continuing quest for great wings that might transform me into a wing person and I am afraid these still didn't do it. I tasted very little besides the Korean red chili paste (Gochujang) and sugar in the Crisp BBQ sauce and the Seoul Sassy wasn't very memorable either. Yes, the skin was fried crispy but I would rather have my wings smoked or grilled, and seasoned well with some good spice rubs (like Jerk seasoning).    Don't come here expecting authentic Korean food and you probably will enjoy your meal more than we did.",0.9399,0.876,0.081,0.043,0.4844619353710263

No need to call ahead as they'll have your order done in about 5 minutes. I ordered the crisp bbq half chicken. It was amazing. The sauce has a little kick to it, but nothing too spicy.

I think Pecking Order has better wings, if you don't mind traveling a little farther north for them they are so worth it. The chicken bowl was interesting and way too much, you could easily split this. In my opinion there was just too much rice and sauce and not enough chicken.

It's usually slathered in some special sauce which leads to the flavor explosion of sweet, spicy, salty at the same time, while still managing to retain that lovely crisp. The wings at crisp are HUGE. They are the full wing, not just a drumstick or a midjoint. It's the entire thing.

There is a similar Korean BBQ / Chicken restaurant about half an hour from me, however they take anywhere from 30-50 minutes preparing the food. To be honest, the Korean chicken I'm used to doesn't even TOUCH Crisp's level of excellence. We ordered the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ flavored wings and two sides of rice. It was a large order and it took them less than 10 minutes to prepare. LESS. THAN. TEN. I cannot even explain the magnitude of that. When the food arrived I literally sat there in awe. It's a shame they don't have a twitter because even though I never use it, I would've hashtagged the crap out of them.  The wings were hot and slathered in yummy, yummy sauce. It's not like the wings you get at bdubs where the food is drowning in it, and there wasn't a messy disaster all over my hands and face when I was finished. I personally prefer the Crisp BBQ because it had that nice spicy and tangy kick to it, but both are absolutely delicious. Indoor decor was actually very cute as well. Lime green walls and humorous posters and flyers, I got a good chuckle out of them. It can get a little crowded though, but I went on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't too bad. Very good turnover.

However we didn't notice it, the delivery guys were walking in and out of the restaurant AND the door was open!! So we stood outside for a second and decided we thought it was very rude how they approached us. So I wanted to speak with them about it.   As I walk in the delivery driver runs up to the door and locks me out.  I said ""Can you please open the door I would like to speak with the manager"".  He says ""Oh No, it looks like the door is locked"". Really? Seriously! He finally decided to let me in. Within my first step some 6'4'' guy comes lunging at me saying ""GET OUT! GET OUT!"" he then told me he didn't care that they were being rude to us and to ""Go write about it on Yelp!"".  The only thing I could say in response to this kind of abuse towards their customers is ""Go F&*k Yourself!"" and then I walked out.

We devoured the food in a manner of minutes and I, who generally loathe skin and fat, for not just health reasons but also texture, scarfed up everything, skin and all. The fresh fries and fried mushrooms are pretty good too.  Most of the poor reviews are for either space (are you seriously coming here for ambience?!?!), packaging (who cares about napkins, just take it home), price, or over-frying. As far as value, I got the whole chicken deal with 2 sides so it turned out to be affordable for two people. Also, I can see what some are saying about the food being overly crisp. I definitely noticed pieces that weren't quite meat and likely were cartilage or soft bone, which were not easy to visually distinguish. But ignorance can be bliss and I ate them anyway. That said, I did not have any issues with the meat being dried out, even on the breast.   The place is pretty small so takeout is probably best. But kudos to the lady behind the counter because she was exceptionally friendly and helpful.  Lastly, a word to the wise: the food smells intoxicating (in a good way!) so beware if traveling far.

Korean BBQ chicken tenders: Your traditional chicken tender tossed in a combo Korean-American BBQ. The sauce is slightly spicy, tangy, and sweet. Had an interesting, almost gritty texture at times. Good, but not as mind-blowing as the Seoul wings. 3. Fries: Pretty typical skinny-sliced fries tossed with a bit of salt in a paper bag. All-in-all, a delicious and very filling meal.

The only problem with crisp is you have to get the Big Boy Buddha Bowl to get all the good stuff the bowl should have, and that's $10.  While the bowl at that point is so big, it will be leftovers as well, if you're getting more than just a bowl, the cost can get up there fast, especially if its on the weekend and the $20 deal isn't on.

Yes! 2) Seoul Saucey wings were very good and not super sticky and gooey. BAD CRISP 1) Original Bee Bim Bop was modest in size. Meat is extra. WTF? 2) 15 wings and meatless BBB to go came out to $37.  3) No napkins were put in bag. For $37 you'd think they could give me a big roll! 4) There were a couple wet naps. But when ripped open, they were bone dry. Verdict - because we were so pissed off to have to drive with sticky greasy hands (me and wife love to eat fresh fried wings while hot and crispy in car), I'll come back maybe once or twice a year. Wings are good but hate giving return business to stingy primadonna restauranteuers. The keepers are the ones who let the people eat and make take care of them when they are done.

The Seoul Sassy sauce is unbelievable, but the BBQ is spicier. The Buddha bowls (bibimbap) are also very good. BYOB, and this becomes the perfect spot to hang out on a Friday night.

2013-05-02,5.0,"No restaurant in Chicago has been on my list of places to eat longer than Crisp.  For four years (give or take), I walked or drove by this place telling myself I need to stop in sometime soon but never did.  The ""problem"" was that it was so close I kept telling myself I would get around to it next weekend or the weekend after that or the weekend after that.  That was a mistake.  Crisp is one of the best in-and-out places to eat on the entire North Side. I recently ordered the Original Bad Boy Buddha (Bowl) and five whole jumbo wings of the Seoul Sassy variety.  Initially I was going to go with the Baby Buddha and 10 wings but it turns out I made the right choice.  The Bad Boy was very large and surprisingly filling considering how many veggies are included.  The veggies are great but you also get plenty of meat and rice at the bottom of the bowl to mix it all together.  The Buddha Bowls are a fantastic option for anyone not interested in getting wings. But not getting wings when visiting Crisp should be a crime.  They are the best wings I've ever had in Chicago (Disclosure: I have not yet been to Jake Melnick's Corner Tap, winner of multiple city-wide wing competitions).  When I go to a sports bar with plans to order ""jumbo"" wings (think Gamekeepers, McGee's, Bird's Nest, etc.), I assume I'm going to need 20 wings drenched in sauce to be full.  At Crisp, 10 is the most I would ever consider ordering and that would only happen if I wasn't planning to eat anything else with my meal.  The wings are huge (some as big as a regular chicken leg), perfectly crisp, and only lightly sauced, just like God intended. The Seoul Sassy sauce, while tasty, wasn't nearly as inventive as I was led to believe.  You've likely had similar sauces several times throughout your career as a wing eater.  And the fries only serve as a nice change of pace for your taste buds between wings.  But neither of those things call for docking of points.  Crisp makes a simple promise and they absolutely deliver on that promise.",0.9901,0.803,0.14,0.057,0.5398843026891806

This last time, we went at about 8:30, and it was almost impossible to find a seat (we happened to get lucky!). There was a line to the door the whole time we were there.  Their chicken wings are some of the best I've ever had. 10 wings ($15.95) are equal to about 20-25 wings anywhere else. They're full wings, and huge portions. We got half sassy, and half BBQ. Both were wonderfully crisp on the outside with tender chicken on the inside. The sauces are amazing, and you can taste that everything is fresh. Their atomic sauce is also pretty phenomenal.  My one beef with this place is that they close at 9:30, and stop taking orders at 9:00. That's their choice, but they probably lose a lot of business by not being open later. They were still standing-room-only packed when they closed, and they turned a lot of people away.",0.8909,0.864,0.104,0.033,0.4971088435374149

2013-04-26,5.0,"You ever hear of the movie 'Midnight Meat Train'? Not the porn version -- I'm talking about the regular ole film version of the Clive Barker short story.  Don't worry if this piece of cinematic magic is news to you, the rest of the review will have nothing to do with this flick -- plus, I'm gonna spoil it for you right here: Reptile people + the tried and true lesson that when you see something strange going down on the subway, you just better mind your own damn business and keep on your merry way.  Where was I again?   So those two versions of Midnight Meat Train are the ones that the general public is more likely to know about, but MY midnight meat train is actually a train of thought where when it gets late and I'm alone, I entertain the thought of giving up the whole vegetarian thing I've been working on the past 5 or 6 years, and sneaking some bites of something that used to be alive. Something that's now taken on the form of fried chicken or bacon or beef jerky or anything that's really sh*tty for you and once had a heart.  To date, I've been able to resist purchasing my ticket to ride the midnight meat train of thought, but f*ck is it ever gonna be hard now that I've tasted the sweet, spicy sauces cloaking Crisp's fried chicken flesh. It's pretty much all I can think about, and that's not a good sign for my feathered friends.  Today was the first of many future visits to Crisp, thanks to tag-team combo of Danny W and the serendipitous running into of Matt ""Lollycakes"" L. Less any poultry fragments in the spoonful of sauce I scraped off Danny's basket-o-chicken bits, I refrained from hopping on the noon o' clock meat train, but that sauce... F*ck. it was so good. So good I literally ate it alone with a spoon.  For my meal I got the Big Boy Buddha bowl with tofu, which is pretty much a bibimbap blend of goodies. It was enough for lunch, second lunch while I sat in traffic for two hours on my drive back to the 'burbs, pre-dinner (or as Hobbits would call it, elevensies) and will likely last through my real dinner as well. At $11 for an almost literal trough full of food, I'd say that's a steal.  Inside is pretty tiny and they've got the whole communal table set-up thing going, which I definitely hate, but I guess when you're working with such a small space, it'd be hard to do anything but. All the napkins, chopsticks, etc are in the middle of the tables, and you have to share sauces with everyone else at your table (also hate sharing), so that kind of stinks, but what're ya gonna do? I lathered my bowl in sriracha, but I would've love to try their Buddha sauce. Unfortunately, it was across the table and when I weighed out my options and I decided I'd rather not have to make any conversation and not have the sauce, than have it, so perhaps next time I can better align myself to be on the side of the table that houses all the sauces so having to socialize is a non-issue.  The counter people were refreshingly friendly and they have Honest Tea in like eight different flavors so you know I was happy because that sh*t is good as hell. If you haven't had it, defo try maxin' on some white peach flavor.  I can't wait to go back... and attempt to resist boarding that meat train.",0.9849,0.808,0.117,0.075,0.4848047282829892

After ordering (two Seoul Steak Bowls and 10 Crisp BBQ Wings), I was told my food would be there in an hour. To my dismay, it was my roommate at the door ten minutes later. Lucky for him, he had food in his hands. For it was just two minutes ago that he had encountered the wonderful angel on a bicycle with a paper bag in his mitts. ""What a beautiful day,"" Corey thought of the sight. Little did he know that this would be the best meal of his life. After a brief discussion with the angel (read: Crisp delivery boy), it occurred to Corey that the food was for us, and he gladly accepted the gift from the heavens. Snap back to reality, ten minutes after Josh had placed the order. While running up the stairs only to see  his roommate and not the delivery boy, it was not but a moment until Josh understood what had truly happened. Like an invisible miracle, Crisp had delivered its offering into my home. One word: The Wings. Oh I guess that's two. One more word. Sublime. If you remember one thing from this haze, order the wings. What was once considered mere appetizer suddenly became the focus of our world. We had ordered the large, and we were glad that we did. The Crispy BBQ wings exceeded our lofty expectations. And this was only the first stop on a two-way ticket to paradise. The Seoul Steak Bowls were tonight's crowning achievement. After stopping ourselves from finishing the wings (Large order), we cautiously moved to the mound of rice and Korean Beef in front of us. After dousing it with what could only have been some form of magical juice, we dug in. And boy did we feast. After having half of the scrumptious beef soaked in salivating spicy (not that bad) red sauce, we decided it was time to take a break.  That lasted little over an hour -- we devoured the rest at this point.  Bottom line: Crisp was damn near an other-worldly experience.  Don't take these words lightly.

On to the fries.  Meh, is all I can say.  Thin and crispy, which I prefer to the overcooked skin-on things most places serve (they can't be arsed to fry the damn things twice, like they should be).  But like the chicken, inexplicably bland.  Poured some of the mystery sauce over them and it still didn't save the day.

It's pretty small, but it feels like a friend's cozy dining room with community tables (and a few stools placed by the windows). Kind of a hipster haven (which is fine by this SF girl).  Want a bowl of yumminess? Opt for the baby Buddha (plenty to fill your tummy) and you can add meat to any bowl size. Got a manly appetite? Opt for the bad boy Buddha. Or if you are insane go for the big boy Buddha and good luck! Want it all wrapped up? Yep, you can get everything in the bowl wrapped up in a burrito! Or if you're just feeling like you need to eat a half a chicken you can get some Seoul slappin' sassy wings!  The rice is sticky and perfect (and you can order organic brown rice too) and covered by chilled veggies (the number and type of veggies differ according to your bowl size). I ordered the baby Buddha and added the beef. I forgot to cancel the egg on top, but it ended up being pretty damn good. I really like dichotomies in my food: sweet and spicy, warm and cold, salty and sweet. The bowls provide an interesting layer of cold rice and veg, warm meat and a freshly cooked egg. And as a condiment lover, I adore the choice of sauces provided on each table. The atomic and the Buddha sauces are oh so good!  I can't wait to go back and try the chicken. Also, the beef was so good I might go for a Seoul steak bowl (meat, scallions over rice).  Downside - cash only, but they have an ATM onsite and charge a modest $1.00 fee. Upside: they deliver.

2013-03-04,3.0,"Just to add my two cents as a Korean American: First, I can't comment on the chicken because I'm vegetarian (actually a pescatarian).  On the bi bim bap (or Buddha bowls, as they call them): the bi bim bap is supposed to be spicy and a little sweet. However, their sauce is extremely sweet and a little spicy. If you add a lot of it to make it spicier, then your food just becomes super sweet. Also, the other sauce with mayo is not a Korean sauce at all. I don't know why they have it there. The rice itself is somehow lacking as well, in a way I can't describe.  On the presentation: It's terrible that they make you pay for your own side dishes. They don't promote the Korean dining experience at all. Korean dining is all about getting a well balanced meal and getting a ton of side dishes with your main entrée. At least the kimchi should be free. Also, bi bim bap always traditionally comes with soy soup, which is similar to the Japanese miso soup.  So yes, flavor is good, but you can have bi bim bap as good as this in other Korean restaurants in town (Cho Sun Ok or Sam Soo Gab San are my favorites) and get more for your money. If you're at Crisp for the chicken, you won't be able to get it at other Korean restaurants in town since it's specialized. The only other place I know that has it is Dak on Granville.

You're in America and there's a taste people here might enjoy more than the majority of peeps in Korea.  Anyways, the taste.  I'd order the spicy wings over any other sauce.

I hope they don't mess around with the quantity. I m still enjoying Crisp the next day for lunch.  Service  TOP of the line. Everybody was cheerful about helping me out with my order and also asking if I had enjoyed what I had eaten. Not many places do that.

Would love to try the rest of the menu at some point but to come here and not have the wings almost seems wrong. Be warned that these are SUPER JUMBO wings.

2012-09-18,4.0,"Here on business, I came to Crisp after browsing around places to try in Chicago. Korean, chicken wings, adventure all in one night? Sure why not! I took a cab from downtown Chicago, and arrived at Crisp in roughly 15-20 minutes with traffic. The fare was rather cheap, wrapping at around $15. Entering Crisp, you are in a pretty vibrant environment with bright colored walls, 3 park bench seatings, and also tray & wall seatings facing outdoors. Come in, look at the menu, look at their bowls, and look at all that yummy chicken you can order! What brought me to Crisp was the chicken wings, so that was on my #1 list on what to get. I opted to get 10 wings, 5 Seoul Sassy, and 5 Crisp BBQ. Asking the waiter what type of sides were good, I also decided to get some crispy fries with the whole meal. I waited by the window seating drinking my water. When they called my name, I came to get my order to realize I may have over did it. Why you ask? Well as a west coaster, when I think chicken wings, I think buffalo wild wings or wing stop. You know what's in common with these two spots? SMALL ASS CHICKEN WINGS. BOOM -- the Menu reads ""Whole Jumbo Wings"" -- *hits forehead* .. 10 of those bad boys were a challenge for 1 person! Two people may be doable, but I still think 3 would be on the safe side, however I went ahead and attacked those wings because they looked so delectible. First off, the wings were frieds & cooked to perfection. Such ""CRISP"" skin, and tasty. That's what I love about chicken wings first! Then the meat, which wasn't skimp and a lot for the money! For the flavors, the Seoul Sassy wings were sweet with some Korean spices and soy. It was marinated so throughly that the meat inside had some of the flavors found with the outside skin & sauce. These wings were rather glazed and not hardcore saucy like the ones I found on the Crisp BBQ. Those wings were like you were eating BBQ ribs. Saucy, and thick. It was spicy & sweet, and gave a little kick. Not overly done, just about right! Man so DELICIOUS! The fries were also good if you are into crispy fries. On the table they had these two sauces, one called something-something Atomic, and the other was called Buddah sauce. I fell in love with the Buddah sauce & rather use ketchup just layered my fries with it. Off the tip of my tongue, I knew what the sauce was, but even while I am writing this review, it still alludes me, but man was it g-o-o-d! Other things that Crisp offers are these bowls that looked like they were worth trying as well and also sandwiches. Being the ease dropper I am, the chicken bowl looked tasty. They also offer burritos which are what are in the bowls, but wrapped up, so if you want variety, there you have it. I left full, only finishing 4 wings, and half the fries. The smell of the wings in my hotel room right now makes my mouth water. Is it worth all the hype? As a out of towner, I think so if you are into Asian flavors and chicken wings is your thing! 4.5/5 Stars! I'll be back next time I'm in Chicago.",0.9945,0.852,0.117,0.031,0.5169997165532881

They make them fried and then coated in honey and sesame.. and that's all I could think of while eating at Crisp! Crisp chicken is tasty, but it doesn't scream Korean-flavors. We also go the Bad Buddha bi bim bop, which wasn't that good. The veggies were all American veggies, like cucumbers and corn. I kept expecting to have pickled veggies and more seaweed.  The thing I really liked about Crisp were the communal seating and stacks of chopsticks & sauces. It's always fun to eat Asian-low-key-restaurant style.  Overall, Crisp is pretty good. I think it definitely caters to the American taste buds and eases a newbie's way into a Korean meal.  Lastly, it just occurred to me... majority of Koreans are Christians.

At home,my sense of taste and touch was able connect with my sense of smell.  The torture was all worth it.  Crisp has FlavorFULL chicken, seriously finger lickin' good --they need to own that phrase from KFC (which doesn't come even close to Crisp).  Crisp does chicken the way chicken should be done.  Also had the steak bowl, bulgogi, okay.  I had a taste of it and kept it in the fridge for another time. I missed the traditional pickled sides that usually accompany Korean entrees.  I wamted to concentrate on the chicken.  I won't be able to stop thinking about or craving the flavors I was exposed to today. TWO DAYS LATER: So in the beginning I wasn't impressed by the steak bowl.  Looing at it, I thought the  rice ratio was too high.  But after evening church service today, I was starved and remembered the steak bowl in the fridge.  This time I poured over the so called ""Atomic"" sauce which I had overlooked before thinking it was just orange colored mayo. Immediately touching my tongue I knw why they call it what they do!  The stuff is just out of this world!  To think I almost threw it out!  The favors and textures added 100% kick to the dish and now I think the bulgogi rice ratio is just right.  Not only will I be returning to Crisp for their incredible chicken but for their steak bowl saturated with the Automic sauce!  I'm looking forward to trying all the other items as well.

Update: I went back and got the bad boy buddha bowl.  I added beef for just $1 extra and there was a lot of it.  The portion was huge!  I ate there to be sure the hot was hot and the cold was cold.  They serve it in what is basically a metal mixing bowl, full to the top with goodness.  Carrots, corn, fresh spinach, mushrooms, bean sprouts, zucchini and cucumbers which were both pickled, and Korean radishes over sticky white rice with a sauce and a fried egg on top.  I went in thinking a mainly veggie dish couldn't be that filling, but this was like a Man vs. Food challenge.  Thank goodness I had a mile walk home to burn some of it off.  I really couldn't be happier with this place.",0.9785,0.789,0.163,0.048,0.514236111111111

In fact, they even tell me cool stuff like about Crisp being delicious. So when my bestie suggested we try it...the prospect pleased. We went on an early weekday evening and it was busy. We ordered 5 wings in Seoul Sassy sauce, 3 chicken tenders in BBQ Spicy sauce, and a chicken breast sandwich in Seoul Sassy sauce. It's BYOB so while they made the order my partner bopped out to get beer. As soon as he returned the food was up and we got a table.  The wings and tenders were so great it was hard to chose which sauce was better. The Sassy sauce is kinda complex and sweet and a transparent glaze. The BBQ was sweet with a spicy aftertaste. They were both sooo meaty, huge, and tender. I found the two sauces and meat quality and portions impressive. He liked his sandwich since it had veggies on it to elevate the flavor profile. I know, I'd always choose the wings or tenders. That's just me, different views, Diary, some people like cucumber better pickle. Anyhow, I definitely recommend it, Diary, not that I think you eat.

Another capacity is this wonderful locale nestled like a baby chick just south of Wellington on Broadway. I have brought my family here, dates, anyone and everyone that I feel needs to experience how tasty these Buddha blessed wings are. A poignant statement was uttered in the back of Bobtail one day during a break-induced bender of Crisp chicken about how the chicken may not be the highest quality. However! This critique was complimented by the ring of all of the various Crisp sauces surrounding everyone's mouths. Each and every one of the sauces is so incredibly unique but absolutely addicting. I would eat it cold, warm, pipping hot, maybe even scalding. Coupled with some onion rings and Alison's Atomic sauce spells doom for any type of productivity regarding the scooping of ice cream or entertaining whoever I brought to this magical place. I also have no shame in putting the Crisp bowls in my mouth. The mixture is incredibly interesting since some of the ingredients are hot (the rice, protein of choice, the egg) while the other ingredients are cold (spinach, carrots). Swirling it all together is my go to method, but I'm sure you can eat everything individually if you like. I don't care; just get that bowl in your mouth! Make sure you take notice of a tall, handsome employee there that is clearly Irish.

I'm seriously salivating right now thinking about it.  *takes a moment* Okay, so since then I have tried their steak sandwich, which is weird and messy but really good. I get it with the cheese and stuff. However, my favorite at the moment is their baby buddha bowl. Its just full of deliciousness. Lots of zucchini and spinach and sprouts and I usually get steak added to it and ask for a side of Seoul Sassy sauce... and then I add a bit of Al's Atomic sauce... and it comes with an egg on top and the yolk oozes down and mixes with everything ... what? Its perfect that way I swear!!  Their onion rings are pretty tasty too.

2012-06-06,4.0,"Crisp is excellent, but there are some key things you should know before you walk in.  Observation the First: The menu is made of two main items, Fried Chicken and ""Buddha Bowls"". The Fried Chicken is incredible, I recommend the Korean Style. The Buddha Bowls are excellent for Asian comfort food. Meat/Tofu is extra, otherwise the bowls just come with just the rice, veggies, and a fried egg.  Second: Cash only, they have an ATM inside but it charges a fee. Expect to pay $8-$15 per person.  Third: The fries are not that great. I'd say skip them. Fourth: The menu is not on the TV screens above the cashier, I remember my first time here I was looking at some random Karate movie and America's funniest home videos waiting for a menu to pop up. I no doubt looked like an idiot, but whatever. The menus are printed and are on the counter where the cashiers are. Fifth: The hot sauce is NOT the red one, it's the pinkish one marked ""Aly's Atomic Sauce"" and it's excellent, this caught me off guard my first time.

No, I am not talking about Kentucky Fried Chicken. If you follow Toronto food scene, or any food scene around the world right now- KFC means Korean Fried Chicken. It all started in New York when Bon Chon made it's way to Manhattan. People were getting tired of regular deep fried chicken (which I still love) and wanted something different. And then KFC came along, with their soy sauce marinade that's sweet and tangy or spicy sauce with a kick. KFC trend is going far that you can randomly find it at hipster tapas place that is not Korean restaurant. Crisp is def one of the spin off from the KFC trend in America, they are known for deep fried chicken called Seoul Sassy and people from Chicago were all over it! I knew I had to give it a try. Crisp is a small place with as many seats crammed in as possible. By the time I went, all the tables were full except the side tables.  Since we were there for a quick bite, it didn't really matter and we just took the side seats. Also, it was a second stop after my first meal- my friend and I were already so full. We just ordered Seoul Sassy Half chicken for $8.95. Seoul Sassy is a 'subtly sweet sauce prepared with ginger, soy, garlic and spices'. Chicken takes awhile because it's made when you order. I think we waited good 20 minutes for it to come out, but it was worth it at the end. Their chicken is deep fried with very thin batter but it comes out super crispy. Then it is covered in sauce as it is cooked again so the batter soaks up most of the goodness so that most of it ends up in your mouth, not your hands! Chicken was fresh and the meat was so juicy bursting with flavor. It was a little on the salty side, just to be eaten on it's own. The sauce had really strong garlic flavor and it was topped with green onions as well. Def not a food to eat on a date.  Summary: Overall it was a good KFC, I just wish I had room to try other things off the menu like their Buddha Bowl which is basically a BiBimBab but with variety of vegetables you can choose from. If you love KFC, Crisp is def worth trying.",0.9941,0.855,0.127,0.018,0.5760821946415167

The Chicken tenders are nice too, but were a smaller pieces than I thought they would be.  As for the other offerings, the bowls are good, I like that their bibimbap has a good selection of veggies.   Their fries are pretty wonderful too--you get a pretty great sized basket when you dine in.  Lastly--I do have to say that the seating area confused the heck out of me the first time I went, I didn't realize that you had to just find a spot and sit down. It has a nice community feeling though. And don't forget that it's BYOB!

As the other 900ish people have said before me, the seoul sassy sauce is very good.  I also liked the crisp bbq sauce, because it was nice and spicy. I tried out the sauces on the table, alison's atomic and buddha bowl sauces, on some white rice out of curiosity. The buddha bowl sauce is so delicious. It's gochujang, which is a spicy fermented soybean paste that I'm obsessed with it.  Between the 3 piece strips, wings and side of rice, we were stuffed.  When I went up to ask for a to go box, the girl asked how I liked my food.  I told her that I loved the buddha's bowl sauce and everything we ate, so she just gave me a side of all three sauces.   Asian restaurants can be pretty easy to judge based on whether or not there are Asian people actually eating there.  Yes, there were some Koreans while I was there.  However Crisp isn't intimidating to people not familiar with Korean food, because the menu isn't full of dishes listed in Korean, the food has an American twist and the staff working the front, from what I saw, weren't Korean.  I sound judgmental, but once a hostess at a Korean BBQ restaurant frowned at my family once she realized all these Korean-looking people didn't actually speak Korean.  I'm coming back here so soon.

I love these new semi-fast food, quick counter Korean fusion places as an alternative to the sit-down Korean joints, even when the word ""belly"" is in the name. Food is fresh and creative. Service fast and enthusiastic, and It's real low-cost healthy fare. And fusion choices such as Korean Burritos (offered here) and tacos and hot dogs in some other spots.   We came here on a week night, a couple roomies and me, in a famished state. We all took advantage of the various Buddha Bowls. Audrey got a side of Korean veggies. I bought a side of Kim Chee for the table. Our little bellies quickly became bigger Buddha bellies by the time we left. With big sighs and an ""I can't believe we ate the whole thing"" consensus, we were only around $13 poorer, and we got more than our daily minimum of good fresh food.  The Kim Chee, which I believe is one of the world's best appetizers, as well as a side, was the best I've had in awhile. Since this place is smack in the middle of my weekly stomping grounds, I can see getting Kim Chee for takeout ($3.95) on a regular basis.  I like the casual and minimal space as well as the large common picnic tables where you can sprawl out and eat comfortably. And I don't even mind bussing my own table.

I order the Seoul Steak Bowl with brown rice. I should have gotten to get the Chicken bowl, but thought it would still be okay due to the Seoul Sassy sauce on the beef as well. WRONG. The meal in front of me was rice with shredded beef on top, simply. I was not happy and still hungry after six of so not great mouth fulls.  I then ordered the recommend (per yelp reviews) Seoul Sassy chicken wings. The two stars is only do the this: very crisp breaded chicken with juicy, tender meat. Tasty with a good presentation. Yet, the sauce just OK; nothing great. They made up for the bowl somewhat with the Seoul Sassy chicken wings My disappointment (and lost of one star) came mainly from the customer service.

Crisp, you are the first restaurant I KNOW that did not offer a refund or a replace order when the customer informed you they did not like it. Maybe there is a no refund sign somewhere...this was my thoughts on the ride home to give them the benefit of the doubt.  In addition, please check on your restrooms for cleanliness every hour or so. The ladies room was not kept well today. Overall, I will not be back and I feel they will not care.

Our group had two orders of Seoul sassy wings, and one order of the Seoul steak bowl and Chi-town chicken bowl. The wings came in six pieces per order. They were indeed CRISP and golden brown! Yummy! In addition, I also had the Seoul steak bowl and it was enjoyable. To sum it up, it was a bowl of minced bulgogi atop seasoned white rice served with Alison's atomic sauce.

2011-09-19,3.0,"Upon recommendation from a friend, we decided to try this place out. Being that I come from NYC, we have the likes of Bon Chon, Kyo Chon, Unidentified Flying Chickens, and Mad For Chicken. Crisp has high standards to live by, and because of this, I was intrigued to see if they can live up to their competition on the East Coast. The ambiance is simple, with 3 large picnic-sized communal tables. You order at the back, wait for your name to be called and eat at one the 3 large communal tables. If you like your privacy, I recommend taking it on the go, but you risk the chance of the wings not being as fresh and crispy. For our first visit here, we ordered the 10 piece whole jumbo wings ($15.95) with Seoul Sassy sauce, touted as a sweet sauce consisting of ginger, soy, garlic and spices. We also ordered the Baby Buddha Bowl ($6.95) with beef (extra $1.00), and a side of their Superfly Frites (Small - $2.25). In about 8 minutes, my name was called and my tray of wings and fries were waiting to be picked up. The Baby Buddha Bowl wasn't ready for another 5 minutes, but one of the staff members were nice enough to bring it over to us. The Korean fried chicken indeed lived up to its name. It was perfectly crisp, sort of like a twice-fried crispy french fry vs. a soggy once-fried french fry. The meat inside the legs and wings were so juicy and tender. Thank goodness for dark meat. But that Seoul Sassy sauce really took it over the top, sweet, savory, salty, with a subtle spiciness. No flavor overwhelmed the other, making for a well-balanced palate pleaser that had my taste buds jumping up and down. Crisp's fried chicken may not be as good as some of their New York City counterparts, but they make one darn good delicious wing that is a must try, especially for those that have never had Korean fried chicken. The french fries were fairly standard, extra crispy on the outside, though not very potatoey inside. They were good, but definitely didn't much for me. The Baby Buddha Bowl is where things fell apart. It is touted as a mini adaptation of a traditional Korean dish called bimbimbap, but it was so very far from that. It was not served in a hot stone ceramic pot that it is usually served in and there was no sizzle factor. The texture of the rice sort of felt like it came right out of the rice pot with no crispiness whatsoever. The fried egg and vegetables (spinach, bean sprouts, carrots and zucchini) were spread on top in bimbimbap fashion, but when mixed together, none of the ingredients really seemed to complement each other to make for a tasty concoction. It left for a rather timid dish that felt like the ingredients were carelessly thrown in a dish and claimed as bimbimbap. The Korean hot sauce, called Gochujang, which is better known as a Korean red chili bean paste, was not spicy at all. Even tasting it alone, brought barely any heat to my tongue. For any avid bimbimbap fans, I'd avoid the baby buddha at all costs, at it leaves nothing to be desired. After 3-4 bites, we wound up throwing away the rest. One of the cashiers I had ordered from was also especially rude. When I put in the order for the Jumbo Wings, he looked at me as if I were stupid and asked me impolitely in one way or another, ""You gonna tell me what sauce? or what?"" And as I was paying, he took a phone call. He ran my credit card and handed it back to me. I was waiting for a receipt but didn't want to be rude and interrupt his call, but he gave me a look and motioned for me to move over so the next customer can order. Crisp definitely does serve some delicious Korean fried chicken that is a must-try, especially for the uninitiated. For that I would give them 5 stars, but because I'm comparing it to some of their NYC competition, I'll give it 4 stars. But their fries and Buddha Bowls can easily be overlooked. I really can't believe how wrong they seemed to get the bimbimbap and why they would even bother putting it on the menu, but apparently quite a few people in the restaurant seemed to be eating it and loving it. And last but not least was their rude service, which really left me in a somewhat bothered state when I left Crisp.

The line was long, but the service was almost impossibly quick given the crowd. The food was almost uniformly impeccable; enormous chicken wings were fried to an impossibly perfect crisp without tasting remotely greasy. The sauces were perfect accompaniments; the seoul sassy was my personal favorite, although the barbecue was perfectly spicy and sweet without being remotely cloying (as is sadly the case with many Asian and barbecue sauces). The buddha bowl was also a hit; the beef was delicious, the vegetables were all perfectly cooked (I never eat corn, but I made an exception for this), and the rice perfectly soaked up all their juices. Mexican cokes were a really nice perk. The one knock on the food at Crisp was the fried mushroom side dish, which was only so-so. Still, the rest of the food was fantastic, and our entire order (which in these circumstances fed two ravenous 20something males, but would probably have fed 4 normal people) came out under $40.  In summation: an excellent and unique dining option. I already find myself in these parts quite often, but will likely make additional pilgrimages for the express purpose of going to Crisp.",0.9957,0.768,0.218,0.014,0.6963235294117647

The burrito is really missing that kick, that spice, that actual taste that makes you come back for more.

Then when we dove into the Seoul Sassy: oh man. I was very close to licking the inside of the styrofoam container clean. On the website, they say not to call it teriyaki. Why would you call it teriyaki? It's BETTER than that. The chicken's fantastic. And here's the kicker. We ate the stuff an hour AFTER it came out of the oven. Imagine eating it at Crisp itself.

2011-07-25,4.0,"Everyone knows I love hot wings so I keep hearing, ""Have you tried Crisp?""... well, now I can say, ""Yes.""  So here's my honest review... we tried the Bad Boy Buddha Bowl (w/ Beef), jumbo wings with Seoul Sassy sauce, and jumbo wings with Crisp BBQ sauce. Buddha Bowl - We got the one with 8 veggies and beef.  The size is generous.  The only veggie I didn't completely agree with was the corn... I haven't seen corn in the Korean version (bibimbap)... well... ever... but that didn't stop me from devouring it - and liking it.  The gotchujang (red hot) sauce was far from spicy, and it was almost sweet, which left me a little disappointed  If they're going to advertise it as spicy sauce, they should give the patrons an option for real ""spicy"" sauce.  Of course, they should keep the spicy version behind the counter lest some Lakeview patron unknowingly burns a hole in his tongue thinking it's ketchup.  Buddha Bowl = 4.0 stars Wings with Crisp BBQ Sauce - I believe they are trying to go for the Korean wing ""kkanpongi"" taste here, but it's been tamed down a little bit for the local tastebuds.  The Korean version is much spicier and contains more garlic.  This version at Crisp is good, but it could be better if it were a tad spicier and a little less salty.  But overall, I like it.  Crisp BBQ Sauce = 4.0 stars Wings with Seoul Sassy Sauce- I'm not quite sure what to make of this. It wasn't spicy.  And it wasn't really sweet.  And it didn't have much kick.  It just wasn't much of anything memorable.  I recall eating it, but not really being able to taste much of it.  And if I have to strain to taste it... well... ok.  If I were eating wings at a bar, I would say this would be close to Teryaki, but a very mild version.  So from my viewpoint, it wasn't all that.  Seoul Sassy Sauce = 2.5 stars Service and Establishment - Nice location in Lakeview.  Lots of foot traffic in the area.  Parking is spotty, but not impossible.  Several communal type bench seating areas and some stool seating as well (can get a little awkward).  It can get busy at times.  Helpful staff (plus a cute cashier is always a plus).   Good selection of drinks. Fast service.  You can tell this place puts in effort.  Overall = 4.0 stars. Total average rounded up to 4 stars. Eat at Crisp.  If choosing between Crisp BBQ sauce or Seoul Sassy, go with the Crisp BBQ.",0.9915,0.854,0.119,0.026,0.5076262626262626

No pretentious illusions, no corners cut, just veggies, sauce, a little meat and an egg on rice. Dolsot bowls are nowhere to be seen, which is probably for the best because most folks shouldn't be trusted to handle heavy superheated stone bowls.

The sauces are not particularly memorable, and I've tried both. Over $10 for a half chicken (and that's the smallest fried chicken order you can get, I even asked if I could get less than the 6 piece half chicken order and they told me no because it would screw up their inventory). Oh, and when I think of a half chicken, I'm thinking I'm going to get half a chicken, meaning that I would get ONE leg, One wing, One breast, etc., Somehow my half chicken had 2 wings, 2 legs, and 1 breast and 1 other indistinguishable piece. Interesting interpretation of what ""half a chicken"" is, my half has 2 legs and 2 wings? The eat in area is tiny and the atmosphere is for a dive-y kind of place that should charge far less. Don't get me wrong, I LIKE dive-y places, if the food is good and the price is right.

We graciously accepted the offer and our food arrived maybe 5 minutes later. This, people, is simple customer service that so many places just don't get. Very often, people's beef with a place here on Yelp has to do with poor customer service, and their issue could probably be resolved by an establishment making any kind of effort to right the issue.

Since I had time to kill waiting for friend to meet me I started being that creepy person who starts at other peoples food to figure out what they want to eat. The more I looked around the servings of wings the more delicious they looked. They have three preparations to choose from - no sauce, seoul sassy (soy sauce based) and a spicy BBQ sauce. We opted for the spicy BBQ and wow. They. Were. Fabulous. Nice crunch to the skin, the meat inside was juicy and delicious. The sauce was the perfect amount of spice where you taste the initial sweetness of the sauce and then it rounds out to a nice, but NOT overwhelming spicy end note. Again, as a non-wing eater I was really really impressed.  To go with the wings we also went with the Baby Buddha Bowl. The vegetables were crisp and delicious. If you're a vegetarian or just looking for light, refreshing meal this bowl is perfect. Portion is perfect.  I was extremely happy with Crisp.

The Big Bad Buddha, resplendent in a heap of veggies, fried egg and brown rice.  A bit of heaven there, you have there.  I'm not the kind of guy who's concerned about my individual foods touching and cross-pollenating flavors.  And, these Buddha bowls bring on a menagerie of mixed flavor, glued together with an over-easy egg. I beg you to tell me what sounds bad about that. Even the Chi-Town Chicken bowl with nothing but brown rice and some creamy, spicy sauce accommodating chunks of chicken is deceivingly yummy. When something's good, it's just good.  And, I swear that Atomic Sauce hits the spot. But, how you fooled me, Crisp. How you made me question if I really even know what it means to ""hit a spot,"" when I finally visited you today and tried your jumbo wings. PANG!  It felt like taking a frying-pan to the temple when I finally realized what I had been missing. The Seoul Sassy sauce, with a tangy-sweetness playing yin to the chicken's salty yang... the utterly perfectly crispy fried skin, which holds a satisfying crunch in spite of dripping in sauce and manages to melt in your mouth... the sheer size of these things, offering huge juicy bites to complement the crispy goodness. I don't know how else to say it any other way, these Seoul Sassy wings are black-out good. I'm no connoisseur of wings, but I'm guessing that you and I have BOTH had them in each of the following variety: tiny, dry, rubbery, fatty, bony.  I mean, I've lost so much faith in wings that I'm occassionaly slumming it and ordering them boneless. BONELESS!!   Well, no longer.  Crisp you have restored my faith in fried chicken. Let it be said that the Crisp BBQ sauce 'aint too shabby either.  It's that neon red kind of asian sweet sauce, but with a little kick of heat and smoke.  But, for my taste it was a little overpowering.  Kind of threw the balance of flavors off a little bit. Actually, it more literally took all of the accompanying wing flavors outside and curb-stomped them. Also tried the Kim Chee, which was great.  'Nuff said. 650+ Yelp reviewers can't be wrong.  Crisp is it.",0.9945,0.766,0.171,0.063,0.5771701388888889

It's so big that you'll end up eating your leftovers for (an extremely delicious) lunch the next day. *Disclaimer: This may have already been said, but I don't want to read over 600 reviews to find out, so I'm going to pretend it's a completely original thought.",0.8113,0.908,0.071,0.02,0.5708333333333333

Beyond all of that, well, the staff here is totally cool. I always feel welcome and recognized. Crisp once accidentally double-charged my debit card for a meal: Not only did they credit my card, they gave me my next meal for free. On several occasions, I've gotten 4 chicken strips when my order calls for 3. Oh, and seriously, these guys listen to the coolest music of any establishment in the neighborhood. Keep it up, Crisp.

I've had many different place's Korean style chicken, I was more inclined to compare this to Ssaboo in Niles, IL (which in my review noted that it is pretty terrible).  This blew a lot of my expectations away. What's great about this place is you get different parts of the chicken, not just the wings and legs but breast and thigh too.  My friend and I went and split the chicken deal with two sauces, Sassy Seoul and the BBQ (not the Bud's, that'll have to wait until the next visit!), I was far more impressed with the Sassy Seoul although my friend very much enjoyed the BBQ.  The fries are, well, pretty generic but I wasn't expecting anything extraordinary, the Myon Kimchi was great: not sour, not too fresh but still clean and tasty while not being too spicy. The chicken was great, pretty moist and plenty of meat on the bone.  The marinate was also very flavorful and certainly unique, I haven't had any Korean fried chicken that tasted like this. It's a very relaxed environment, friendly to pretty much anyone of any age and any race.  It's great to see traditional bowls be given a more modern or western twist to appeal to everyone, which is I think lacking in a lot more traditional Korean restaurants.  Pricing really isn't too bad either, I definitely say you'll get your money's worth. Parking certainly wasn't a problem at 4PM on a weekday.  The staff wasn't too interactive with guests (...except with women...seemingly...) but still had a great time.  They do have wi-fi but it's protected (and didn't have the password available, which was a little annoying but not necessary).

2010-11-16,4.0,"The Seoul Sassy whole chicken came with 8 pieces of chicken (I didn't count, but I presume there were 2 legs, 2 breasts, 2 wings, and 2 thighs) and is garnished with some green onions.  At $14 dollars pre-tax, I found the price of this chicken to be very reasonable and much cheaper than the other options I've had (I think the KyoChon whole chicken is about $18-19, and the Korean chicken at Momofuku is... well... $100 for the entire dinner (which is just two chickens)).  In terms of taste, I thought it was solid, but not spectacular.  The sauce was a bit sweet for my taste, and the garlic flavor is not as pronounced as other soy-garlic sauces I've had.  In terms of the crunch factor, the fried chicken could have been a bit crispier.  I'm not sure if they double fry this chicken - I don't think they do because it just wasn't as crunchy as places to do this, and once you add the sauce, you will lose a bit of crunch.  However, overall, the chicken did not seem overly oily or heavy, and the dark meat pieces were still juicy and good (the white meat breast pieces were a bit dry).  Overall, the chicken was solid - not as good as KyoChon, but worth coming back to again. Surprisingly, I think the bibimbap was the highlight of my meal.  Now, I'm not sure if that implicates the chicken as just being average, but I think it was more that this was some awesome bibimbap.  To me, this bibimbap was pretty perfect - they used bulgogi as the beef (which is far superior to ground beef), the egg is half fried and not too runny, and there was a diverse selection of vegetables, of both the crunchy and chewy variety.  After adding the hot sauce into this bowl and mixing it up, there just wasn't much else I could ask for.  At $9 pre-tax, I think this is a good deal, considering that you will definitely be full after eating one of these bowls by yourself.

2010-11-15,4.0,"My girlfriend and I went here on my 35th birthday since I wanted to have some good fried chicken. I had heard about this place on the Yahoo ""10 best chicken places in America"" article and thought Korean fried chicken sounded too intriguing to miss! Some of the BEST fried chicken I have ever had! We got the ""Funke Chicken Combo"" (which had a whole chicken, two sides, and two drinks), and a Baby Budda Bowl. All together it was a whole fried chicken, an order of deep-fried mushrooms, an order of onion rings, a side dish of Kimchee, a Baby Budda bowl, and 2 drinks for around $35! The prices are VERY reasonable considering the portion sizes and quality of the food.   The chicken is cut asian style (not whole pieces of breast or thigh but chopped into smaller sizes), and can either come plain (don't let that fool you, it is nicely spiced and very tasty), or coated with one of their sauces (ginger-teryiaki, bbq, and hot and spicy).   The Budda bowls come in a variety of styles and flavors, but it is basically stir fried vegetables over rice with a sauce and a fried egg on top, and comes in three sizes, baby, normal, and big. They also have excellent wings, side dishes Now, although the food is excellent, the place itself has a few issues that need addressing. First of all, parking is somewhat of a problem as it is street  metered parking only. Second, the actual dining area is TINY, with four picnic style tables and a couple of counters to eat at, which can make things very crowded if the place is busy. And finally, the place isn't a resturant, it is a counter order-pick up food kinda place, so don't expect service or for the food to be ready quickly, on the plus side it was very hot and fresh, so it is definitly worth the wait! Oh and when I mentioned it was my birthday and how I had been excited to come and try the place out, the guy behind the counter gave me a free coupon for a whole chicken on my next visit! All in all, a place for GREAT chicken, interesting side dishes, and good food, but not a great place for sit down dining during the lunch or dinner rushes.",0.9943,0.835,0.14,0.025,0.5869691524408507

2010-11-12,4.0,"I should have written this earlier but after trying the wings... I am definitely a fan and feel like an idiot for getting a Korean burrito here instead of the chicken the first time I went. The wings come in portions of 5 or 10... in reality that means 10 or 20 cause one wing is literally the wing of the chicken so it has all both types of pieces you are familiar with hot wings as well as the end tip of the chicken's wing... that was a little confusing with wing being used in that paragraph in many different ways. The Seoul Sassy chicken wings took me back to the Korean style fried wings that I am used and hold very dear to my heart but kicked up a little notch.  The combination and sweetness of the sauce and the crunch of the batter together go perfectly together.  Each ingredient in the sauce I feel really enhances and balances the flavors out.  Along with that and having to rip the three parts of the wing away from each other, the wings are really a lot of fun to eat.  The Seoul Sassy is definitely my favorite and would recommend it to everyone to try.   The Crisp BBQ wings are definitely Korean influenced and has a great kicked-up-a-notch sweetness and hot flavor from the red pepper paste.  Plus the sauce is messier than the Seoul Sassy and that's okay cause if the food isn't messy than it isn't any good.  The more the food gets on all over your face and fingers the better. If you are getting the Buddha bowls I would recommend you ask for at least an extra red pepper paste or two.  In my bibimbaps, I usually like the minimum amount of red pepper paste as possible, and the amount given here still wasn't enough for me.  There was a good variety of vegetables in the Buddha bowl, however I would have liked for there to be more of each vegetable and beef to be in there as well. The fries are very generic and unsalted.  No real flavor comes from them.  But hey that's nothing a little salt and pepper can't fix. Easy to suffice... the wings are the big draw here and for a very good reason: they're just that damn good.",0.9945,0.764,0.173,0.063,0.5164379084967321

I had the Seoul sassy which was amazing. Added fries and a drink for an extra 2 bucks which was worth it. It felt like the fries were endless because the fries were small but there was a lot. Similar to mcdonalds fries which is a plus in my book.  The next time i went i had the spicy BBQ. Not as spicy as i wanted but still very tasty and still very crispy.

So expect to way anywhere from 10 minutes around lunch time when it's not so busy, to as much as an hour on weekend dinners. Parking in the area is crazy, if you've been to Lakeview you know that. You'll be lucky to find anything close. Seating in the place is super cool. It's got group style seating with large picnic style tables in the middle of the room. Counter style stools in the windows and along the wall work great if it's busy or if you're alone. Oh yeah and best part about this place, aside from the food of course, is it's BYOB. So if you and your friends are dying for some bomb-a$$ food and wanna make it a party, Crisp is the place to be.",0.9956,0.8,0.172,0.027,0.5392390289449113

2010-09-16,5.0,"Now this is a story all about how my life got flipped, turned upside down. And I'd like to take a minute so just sit right there. I'll tell you how it came to be with this Crisp-y love affair... Okay okay, bad Crisp pun. But really now, folks. Crisp is for real. After the many reviews that I've read and the number of times that I failed to get there by their 9PM closing hour, I finally found myself standing in line to order some of the most delicious finger food ever. EVER. Now I've had my fair share of chicken, wings in particular. Crisp takes poultry to a whole new level. Something about the crunchiness, or ""crisp""iness if you will, of the wings makes them so divine...and they aren't, like, breaded or anything. Weird. But that's not all! Crisp offers three sauces. On this visit, which was also my first, my girlfriend and I tried the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. Out of all the chicken that I've eaten, the Seoul Sassy somehow manages to leap over almost all of the competition. It's a simple, but perfectly executed, sauce that consists of ginger, soy sauce, garlic, and other seasonings and is topped with scallions. Maybe it's the familiar flavors [I'm a Chinaman], but it definitely hits all the right spots, and then some. The Crisp BBQ was, how do I say this, unexpectedly hot. It wasn't over-the-top ghost chili pepper hot. But it did have an interesting smokey taste to it. Yeah, smokey. We also ordered the Baby Buddha Bowl with beef. The reviews are a little much on these bad boys. It's a real simple dish with rice, veggies, and your selection of meat. It's really hard to mess this one up... Now about halfway through the meal I began to think about how this review would turn out. I liked the wings, but the Buddha Bowl was just okay. Do I give em a four? Are they worthy of the five star status? The deciding factors were the chicken and............. SERVICE!! The guys here rock. They were very welcoming and offered personal opinions and fan favorites. The Crispy Men answered questions about ingredients and even made small talk to pass the time. Stellar service and delicious food. I'll definitely Check-in again.

I remembered that I wanted to try the Plain Jane and I knew that I loved the Seoul Sassy.  I must say, the Plain Jane really sucked. It wasn't as crispy and juicy as the chicken I had last time. The Seoul Sassy was definitely better than Plain Jane.  So it seems that the chicken tastes better when slathered with some sauce. This is not good in my opinion, but who cares what I think, this is one of the top 10 fried chicken spots in America, what do I know. I just know that I will try it again but only if it's saucy, oh and I need to try the wings.  Minus 0.5 for the yucky Plain Jane and minus 0.5 for the crappy note on the receipt from Mr. Crabby Pants, I guess I should have told him from the get go that I didn't have a menu, just a craving.

I believe a little drool may have even sipped out when I was looking at the wings...gulp. Anyway, we went, we saw and boy did we conquer!   The place is tiny and let me tell you that on a Friday night at 8:15pm it was pretty packed. They have 2 ""bar like"" seating areas and the rest are family style tables, so there really is no privacy for intimate conversations...aka, not good for first dates.   I have to say that we (the fiance and I) didn't even talk much since we were concentrating on eating almost the whole time. This off course in between, breathing, drinking, licking our fingers and commenting on the deliciousness. We had the Big Buddha bowl with steak (I got both sauces on the side, which was great since it was nice merriment of sweet and spicy) and we also got wings.  We did half and half - Spicy BBQ and Seoul.

The wings here are very big. And when they say 1 wing, they mean the whole wing: the mini-drumstick, the 2-bone piece, and the little piece at the end that most people don't eat. Not only that, they have a lot of meat on their bones. Other than their wings, they don't offer much else and the place can be a little pricey. Also, there is limited seating and the tables are communal dining style. Parking is scarce around the area as well.

I ordered the half chicken with the Seoul Sassy sauce thinking that would be a lot of food and I'd take some home. I laugh at my naivety now because the thought of leftovers is just ridiculous. I inhaled all of that chicken. All of it.  Since it was so good, and since I have limited self control when the discussion of dinner came up later and Crisp was thrown out again, I hesitantly agreed. Hesitant because I didn't want to go back there and let them know of my new Crisp addiction/problem! I needed a costume with a fake nose and mustache! This time however, I did not eat all of my food and really did have leftovers. Whew.  The following day I ate KFC but that's a tale for another day because the star here is Crisp.

I was a bit leery, knowing that the neighborhood isn't the easiest to park in, but figured what the heck. I'm glad we went.  So, last Sunday, we headed out to try something completely different.   Parking (metered street parking) wasn't as bad as I feared. When we walked in I was a bit surprised at how small the place was. I'd estimate there were about four large picnic-style tables and counter seating around the walls & front window. The place was pretty full, but we found seating without too much trouble.  He got the funke chicken combo (a whole chicken, 2 sides and 2 sodas) and I got  the Baby Budda bowl (brown rice ) with a side dish of Kim Chee (There's a choice of cabbage or radish style).  The Plain Jane chicken was great. Just the right amount of spice and very crispy, yet tender. The onion rings and fried mushrooms were awesome and I really liked the spicy mayo dip that came with em. The BF was VERY satisfied with everything too. I was also impressed with the Kim Chee and the portions were very generous.

Our friends also had us try the Buddha, a mixed bowl of rice, veggies and Korean flavoring.  Crisp's version of Bi Bim Bop.  Pretty tasty.  I favored the Seoul Steak Bowl, with Korean BBQ Beef (Bulgogi).  Similar to the way they cook wings, Crisp's bowls do well with their flavorings, portions, and special ingredients that help differentiate them from other Asian eateries.   The food gets 5 stars, but I'd give it 4 if I took into consideration the restaurant.  It's not a terrible thing, but it's small and gets rather crowded.  I've read there's often a line and no places to sit.  I do know it adds to the restaurant's character, so I'll give it a 5 overall.  Staff is super friendly and moves the line really fast.  And prices are certainly reasonable for what you get.",0.9956,0.748,0.234,0.018,0.5078497023809524

The following Saturday I decided to give it another go because of all the rave reviews I've heard.  - I've had my fair share of Korean food and chicken wings of all sorts in my life time, but I'm sorry these wings weren't impressive. I had the Crisp BBQ and the Seoul Sassy sauces. The Crisp BBQ sauce is basically the red chili paste sauce from bibimbop with some added smoky flavors. The Seoul Sassy sauce was alright - nothing crazy. I didn't appreciate the pool of frying OIL the wings were sitting in -- not appetizing. The meat on the wings was half tender and half dry/hard. Probably could be prevented if the wingette and drumette were separated before fried. - I will admit the size of these wings are fairly bigger than your typical buffalo style wings. I have left overs that I don't want to eat.  - I will pass on this restaurant and stick to the authentic Korean restaurants, Thai angel wings, and Great Sea's wings (on Lawrence and my fave). btw, dol sot bibimbap is 100% better than your plain bibimbap.

You pretty much get 10 drumsticks and 10 regular wings.  They're fried crispy, but not too crispy, and the sauce was very savory and sweet.  They really believe in big portions at Crisp, but I'm not complaining! =] Large selection of bottled and canned beverages was a plus.  They also have MILKIS - a milky, carbonated, soda - similar to Sprite Remix with a hint of dairy.  It sounds weird, but it's definitely my favorite Korean beverage - brings me back to my PC Bang gaming days of Starcraft and Counter Strike. The vibe of the restaurant was very casual with large picnic style tables (enough for a party of 8) and some stools w/ counters.  It's an order & pick up joint so don't go in expecting full service.  Strangely, I didn't see a single Korean employee working when I went.

And whenever I sit right in front of the window, I always see people going to the restaurant next to Subway. That made me wonder what kind of restaurant Crisp was.  When I found out that it served great chicken wings, I decided to look it up on yelp and see if it's worth checking out. Well, of course I checked it out! 1. My first visit didn't really WOW me except for the fact that the guy behind the counter was extremely nice. I had a half chicken plain jane and the guy gave me 4 sauces to try out because I was new to the place and didn't know what to get. That was very thoughtful. My boyfriend loved the sauces so I took some of them and put it in my purse for later usage. Anyway, the place was very picnic-ish so I thought that was cool.  2. Now, my second visit definitely made me start loving the place. When I got there, the dude behind the counter remembered our names already! I decided to try the Seoul Sassy wings and my boyfriend wanted to try the crispy BBQ wings. Oh. My God. We were both devouring and scavenging our plate. We wanted to have a conversation but to heck with that--we wanted to eat and eat and eat because everything was delicious. We had to grab a ton of paper towels because our hands were covered in the awesome sauce. Later that night, I was craving for more. I really do think they put crack in them 'cause they're addicting! 3. I visited them like 3-4 days in a row until my boyfriend told me that it wouldn't be a wise decision because I'd run out of money. The wings aren't dirt cheap and it's not really that expensive either considering we get big momma chicken wings. Compared to other places like Buffalo Wild Wings, the wings that Crisp has is definitely more expensive but MUCH more bigger.  4. And lastly I visited Crisp again yesterday after signing a lease with a friend, so we were like HEY! Let's spend our money and get some chicken. She hasn't been to Crisp before so I told her to look at the menu and see if she'd like anything. She wanted to get one of the Buddha bowls and I got the Seoul Sassy again. She liked her bowl but when I let her try my wings, she said she ""had an orgasm in her mouth."" She definitely loves Crisp and since she's moving in the area with me, she's coming back for more for sure! So overall, the wings are amaaazing. The service is fast and great.

Living in New York for the past 5 years, I've been addicted to Korean fried chicken: Kyochon, Bon Chon, Kyedong and UFC. Not to mention, I absolutely love bibimbop. So, of course, I've been looking forward to trying the food at Crisp. So, last month, I finally had the opportunity try this place. Three of us ordered the following: Original Bad Boy Buddha, half of the Plain Jane, and half of Crisp BBQ. I'm going to be completely honest, the Original Bad Boy Buddha and Plain Jane were just okay.  Granted, the Buddha was a different version of the Korean bimbimbop, but the three of us weren't impressed by it.  The Plain Jane was just okay, and we didn't really dive into it.  However, the Crisp BBQ had really good flavor, and we devoured it. Like I said, I guess I've been spoiled with NY korean friend chicken locations. The chicken at Crisp was WAY TOO greasy.  I know it sounds crazy, but the way the fried chicken is prepared at Kyochon, Bon Chon, Kyedong and UFC, there is HARDLY any grease. It's hard to believe, but until you try it, you'd understand. After eating a dozen, there are only some traces of grease.  However at Crisp, after eating the fried chicken, there was a thick layer of grease. My pros: Crisp BBQ had good flavor, service was FANTASTIC (no matter how busy, they would take the time to answer any questions; attentive and very polite), and the ambiance (I enjoyed the indoor picnic feel).",0.9837,0.816,0.144,0.04,0.569169660127107

2010-04-22,5.0,"There are always thousands of Yelp reviews to dig through from all of the different places my friends have gone ranging from the mundane, such as 7-Eleven or Starbucks to the divine, such as Crisp, Zed451, or Wings Around the World.  The first trek of my wing odyssey took me to 75th and King Drive out in the middle of the deep south side to Wings Around the World, where I had the pleasure to take a bite of Sweet Plum BBQ, Cheesy Buffalo, and Honey Teriyaki wings.  Rounding up the weekly lunch crew, we decided last week on swarming at Crisp to let them show us what they had. It was going to be an interesting experiment to say the least, as none of us had ever stepped foot into Crisp. Renowned for their Korean style fusion wings, my wing radar always detected good wings were in the neighborhood with every step in Boystown. Every time getting off the Belmont CTA stop, I lamented that I was so close yet so far. Parking around Crisp was a cinch at 2:30pm this Wednesday afternoon. We entered Crisp to find one other person outside of our group already waiting for wings and ample space all around to sit where we pleased. Approaching the counter, there stood an impressive display of all the various sodas all for the price of $1 with Vitamin Water for $2 including fan favorites such as Coke Zero, A&W Root Beer. Alongside the pop cans were the various house bowls featuring Bulgolgi and Bi Bim Bap combinations with the Bi Bim Bap serving as the main vegetarian fare for any potential non-meating-eating friends. Without any vegetarians on hand, it was clear that we'd all dive into chicken seventh heaven from wings to fully glazed fried chickens to chunks of chicken in bi bim bap bowls. Knowing that I would be getting a full order of 10 wings, I was surprised when they told me that they had more than one flavor for the wings. For some reason I thought Crisp relied only on the Korean sweet and sour recipe but saw they had BBQ and several kinds of Buffalo Sauce. I've had BBQ and Buffalo sauces from all over the place, so I decided to stick with the basics and go with the Seoul Sassy flavors and an order of fries. A can of Coke Zero accompanied my order, which is always a bonus because Coke Zero definitely doesn't taste like Diet Coke. My friends all ordered in lockstep various dishes and everyone had some wings on the way. I noticed the business card on crisp declared their head chef the house master of wings. Was it true? Could these wings be as magical as Wings Around the World? We sat down at one of the large tables and awaited our orders. As my basket of wings and fries was the first dish ready, I had the uncomfortable ordeal of waiting for everyone's else's food to arrive. I could no longer adhere to the rules of conduct of good manners and picked off a few fries while waiting since it was pushing 3 o'clock and I hadn't had a bite to eat all day! I saw some bowls of Bi Bim Bap materialize, a half of a fried chicken dropped in, and another full order of Crisp wings and then realized it was time to go to down! As with most wing eating experiences, this one was no different, the obligatory wing exchange was facilitated and I traded in one of my Sweet Sassies for a Crisp BBQ-flavored wing. All of the wings were properly fried hard and I found the texture of the wings both majestic and comforting. The Crisp BBQ flavor was less than impressive, with a clumsy taste akin to kim chee. There was heat on thse wings, but there was not enough sweetness, but I didn't mind trying one for the sake of trying. After the exchange ritual, I happily dug into my own set of Seoul Sassy and got the rush of flavor that I expected. Sweet and tangy with a subtle hint of spice, the magic combination dazzled my taste buds and even the little pieces of green onion served to heighten the experience. There is something to be said about Korean wing recipes, and there's no better food experience than tasting a recipe that tries to balance out the different taste sensations and savoring sweet success with every single bite.  The portions were massive and I found myself full after eating about five full-sized wings while another friend threw in the wet nap after four wings. In retrospect, taking pictures of all of the food before we all demolished all of it proved to be fortuitous timing. In the end, we had way too much food for our own good and thus went our indoctrination into the wonderful world of Crisp. It was a pleasant experience to say the least, not having fight off crowds and being able to enjoy a meal with friends without having to feel like the walls were caving in. Were Crisp wings better than Wings Around the World? It's a Tale of Two Wings and I don't think that's a fair comparison as they're entirely different beasts. Are mashed potatoes better than french fries or roasted potatoes? The world may never know, but it's best to try it all before it runs out!",0.9987,0.833,0.137,0.03,0.524049190633349

This place is also quickly becoming one of the favorite places for my friends and I to meet up during the weekdays to recap our questionable antics from the previous weekends. I personally enjoy the original flavor more as the crip bbq or the seoul sassy are both a bit on the sweet side for me. Tried the 10 piece wings for the first time during my last visit and the portion was definitely much bigger than I expected.

Buffalo - you can get that elsewhere.  Basically it boils down to a spicy Korean flavor, and a sweet Korean flavor...both of which are flavorful, unique, and addicting.

At some point I will have to try the chicken, as per other reviews here. Other perks: a huge selection of beverage options, from the mundane (canned sodas) to the less so (some of the weirder flavors of Vitamin Water) to the outright extraterrestrial (Asian drinks with non-English labels.)

Immediately upon entering, we were assaulted by the most incredible smells.  My mouth was watering before I even approached the counter.  They offer both communal seating and counter seating against the wall and against the front window of the restaurant.  I am also thankful that I was carrying cash as they only accept cash payments. I had a tough time deciding on what to order.  We ended up choosing both the Seoul sassy beef bowl and the chicken bowl along with drinks.  The counter person/ manager?  was phenomenal.  Truly, one of the best that I have encountered in quite some time.  He was friendly, quick and asked if he could call me by my first name.  If I owned a restaurant, I would steal him.  He was that good. Their portions are gigantic.  My son was crazy about the beef bowl and had 3 helpings.  Mid-way, he asked me about their fried chicken.  He is just like me; he wants to taste everything and is a big fan of small plates.  I approached the counter to place an order of wings.  We had hardly made a dent in either of our huge bowls, and I was already quite full.  The counter person/ manager? again went beyond and above.  He asked if I just wanted one.  I had already thought that he rocked, but when he gave it to us on the house as a sample, I was floored.  That wing, btw, was cooked with the Seoul Sassy sauce and it was not only huge but incredibly delicious! My son could not help but think that the counter person/manager? was the nicest guy in the world.  He asked me if he could give him a hug when we were leaving.  I didn't want to freak the guy out, so I told him that a simple thank you would be ok.

Anyway, I tried the Not So Common Crisp sandwich minus mayo, with the BBQ sauce. I got the meal which included a side of fries and a can of pop. I was actually ecstatic at their diet pop selection. Might seem like a small detail, and trust me, I'm a diet coke fan, but I just feel like everywhere ONLY has diet coke. Not Crisp! Diet Sunkist, Diet Root Beer, Diet 7-Up, Diet Dr. Pepper! Finally!  Anyway, I got home and I took a bite, and... oh my gosh. Definitely the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. The chicken, as other reviewers say, is amazing. It's perfectly moist and crispy. The BBQ sauce, to die for. The perfect blend of sweet and spicy. It was absolutely delicious and I can't wait to go back and try their other things. Next time I'll probably try the Sassy Seoul sauce (though it will be hard not to get the BBQ again).  One thing - I got the fries basically because I just wanted to try them. I'm actually not a huge french fry fan but I figured it made sense to get the meal for $2.00 more. Well, the fries could feed about 4 people (the small fry). They are huge. I didn't even eat 1/4 of them after the filling sandwich. They were good, similar to McDonalds, maybe a little less cooked... But they're not necessary.

While you can eat inside at the 3 or 4 very practical picnic-style tables, really you're here just to chow down on some good wings, not for a restaurant-style experience.  Like many people, I LOVE wings, and after experiencing wings at Crisp, I'm completely ruined for your run-of-the-mill buffalo wings. I've been here 3 times and twice for take-out, and the food has been consistently amazing. After some experimenting, my vote goes for the Seoul Sassy and the Mild Buffalo wings. Get ready to be punched in the mouth with flavor! Also, note that these wings are basically full-size wings, so for the price, it's pretty great.  One thing my friends have compared this place to is Great Seas, another Asian restaurant known for their Korean-style wings. I decided to go and compare, and after the amazingness of Crisp, I was left slightly disappointed. Great Seas wings are really good, and still tastier than regular buffalo wings, but they don't offer as much of a selection of flavors, and their wings are much smaller than Crisp's.

The 4 of us shared two of their ""dinner specials"", which is a pretty good deal. I believe it's about $20 for a whole chicken and you can pick the flavors. You also get two sides and two drinks. We decided to try the BBQ, Seoul Sassy, and the Buffalo. The Seoul Sassy was definitely my favorite, with a nice hint of sweetness (and it tasted the most ""Asian"" which was what I was looking for). The flavors were all relatively tasty but some of the pieces of chicken were on the dry side. For our sides, we got fries, onion rings, and fried mushrooms. They were all pretty good, but then again what doesn't taste good after it's been battered and deep fried? Overall food = good enough but not amazing. This is definitely not bonchon in NYC Ktown.  What I really DIDN'T like about Crisp was the fact that they have communal tables. The space is pretty small so I can see why they do it, but it's really inconvenient and cramped and compromised my experience significantly.

Perhaps I ordered poorly.  I mean the restaurant's name refers to fried chicken, and that being the case you would expect it to be good.  Given that Crisp has gotten so many good reviews I am compelled to go and try their namesake dish.  Hopefully my second visit will be more memorable, and for good reasons.",-0.9564,0.794,0.056,0.15,0.5428333333333332

Korean burrito does sound unnatural when first approached by it, but it's not whatever atrocity you may be imagining in your mind. Their version is basically bi bim bap in a tortilla w/o an egg.  And it's GLORIOUS!  Out of their ""You so Crazy! Korean Burritos"" (that's what is says on the menu) I've had the Seoul Sensation and the Chi-town chicken. They're basically the same except the Seoul Sensation is made with bulgogi.  It automatically comes with their atomic sauce, which from what my friend says who can handle their fair share of spicy is really hot, so if you aren't into the fire you should ask for their delish ginger sauce instead. I've also had the Greg's Grillmaster sandwich.  I've liked it all, but the Seoul Sensation is what I can't help but get every time I go back.

Instead of strict interpretations of Korean cuisine, Crisp serves it with an American twist (Korean burritos anyone?).  I tried the Crisp BBQ chicken, the Seoul steak bowl, and the Bad Boy Buddha.   The Buddha bowl was a pretty version of bi bim bop, with well seasoned vegetables.  It is a good summer dish, and the best of the 3 dishes. On the other hand, I was less fond of the BBQ chicken and the steak bowl.  I found them to be way too sweet.  The steak bowl, a bastardized version of bulgogi beef, had too much sauce.  I wished they had served me a bigger portion of white rice to balance it out! Decor-wise, it is well-lit, clean and simple.  Seating is fairly limited and communal, so hopefully you won't have to sit next to odd strangers! If you crave Korean food, Crisp is a decent and affordable choice.  However, from my experience so far, I will stick to the vegetarian Buddha bowl.",0.952,0.806,0.136,0.058,0.4772988505747126

It is relatively cheap (around 6 dollars for a baby buddha bowl which is korean style bibimbap- assortment of prepared veggies over rice with a fried egg and gochujang- spicy red pepper sauce.) I usually add beef (marinated korean style chopped up bulgogi flavored) which is $1 and exchange for a healthier brown rice ($1.50 additional). The portions are huge for the buddha bowls. I'm Korean and lived in LA for a few years, but this place is really good and fresh even though it's not traditional! I love bibimbap and all my non-Korean friends love this place too. The seoul sassy wings are excellent too. Very Crisp-y.  They also have the delicious korean drinks that I grew up with like the green grape drink or the asian pear drink. I haven't met anyone who doesn't love bibimbap!  (It's a very Vegetarian friendly dish.) This place is good for groups since they are huge tables even though it is kinda small inside.

(That, along with french fries, lobster, chaco tacos and popcorn.) And, I would definitely have Crisp provide them for me. The wings are big and juicy and very, very fried. Okay, so not the healthiest thing to eat but still mighty good! I opted to be boring and went with the plain chicken wings. They were anything but plain, but didn't really have sauce on them... which I like. I am a fan of buffalo wings, but didn't feel the buffalo mood that evening. I thought the flavors of the wings were perfect... not too salty but not bland, either. And again, they are HUGE! I don't like eating the drumstick parts so I just left those so I would have room for the other part of the meal. I also tried the Buddha bowl with bulgogi (bibimbop). Again, the portion on this was massive! You would have to share it for sure. I have never been a huge bibimbop fan, but for what it is, I thought it was tasty! It was a nice pairing with the chicken wings because it seemed a bit healthier. I also tried the Seoul Sassy wings and was really not a fan. It's not that it wasn't good, it is just that I am more of a salty person rather than a sweet person.  Overall, it was an enjoyable meal. They have communal seating and paper towels for their napkins. Totally casual and totally cheap. There were a lot of people getting their food to go which seemed like a good idea. I probably have to wait awhile before I indulge again in the yumminess of the wings. It's a little too heavy to be eating too much of.

My friend, Adam, turned me on to Crisp.  I remember him saying that when they first opened, he went there every day for a month.  My friends and I tend toward extremes, so I just sort of sloughed off his talk as sort of a throwaway remark.  Months later, we ended up in Crisp.  I followed his advice and ordered a ""Not So Common Crisp"" fried chicken sandwich.  (I just had a Freudian slip of a typo that read: ""sandwiSH.""  That's beause i *wish* I could have one right now.)

2009-04-13,5.0,"I have been looking for a cheap Korean restaurant with good rice bowls for the past three years and finally found it!  I went here last Friday with a group of friends after reading reviews on Yelp.  AWESOME CHOICE.  The place was a bit small (we had eight people) so we had to wait about ten minutes to get a table we could all sit at  but there was plenty of seating at the counters along the wall and by the window.  Overall not too long of a wait especially on a Saturday night.  There's no waiter service so you have to go up to the counter to order and pay.  When your food is ready, they call your name and you go up and get it.  However they do clean up the table for you after you're done so you don't have to worry about where to bring your stuff after. I got a Baby Buddha Bowl with beef (comes with four veggies and a fried egg), my bf got an Original Buddha Bowl with beef (comes with eight different veggies and a fried egg) and we split a five piece order of wings (Seoul Sassy and Korean BBQ).  Our order came out to about $25 ($7 for baby buddha, $9 for original buddha and $7 for 5 piece wing order)which is relatively cheap compared to other korean restaurants and we had a ton of leftovers!   I didn't particulary care for the Korean BBQ wings but the Seoul Sassy wings were the best wings I have ever tasted in my life!  Great Seas on Lawrence and Kedzie used to be my go-to-place for korean wings but I think the wings at Crisp far surpass it!  Theyre oh so deliciously crisp and flavorful!  And there was nothing ""baby"" about the Baby Buddha Bowl...I was starving when I got there but I didn't even come close to finishing it. I wish this place was close enough for delivery.....but its good enough for me to make the 15 minute drive from andersonville at least once or twice a week.  Overall good choice for cheap korean food thats GOOD :)",0.9946,0.814,0.157,0.03,0.54921875

2009-03-09,5.0,"Sadly I have to admit, compared to other big cities Chicago is lacking when it comes to great Korean restaurants.  Aside from Cho San Ok in Lincoln Square, this is the only other Korean (er Korean American) establishment I would recommend. My personal favorite is the Seoul sensation burrito. Unlike the typical rice burritos you find at Chipotle, this baby doesn't leave you feeling gross and heavy at the end of consumption. Filled with rice, marinated beef and a variety of vegetables, it not only tastes good but it's healthy too. The burrito also comes with a pink sauce which I will warn you, is very spicy. If you can handle it, i would strongly suggest you use it. But once again, especially to all the non Koreans out there, it's quite spicy. My second favorite dish is the Dakota steakhouse sandwich. Essentially, this is a Korean style cheese steak sandwich. If you're lactose and tolerant just ask the staff to customize this delicious sandwich. I think what makes this dish amazing is the bread they use. If I  get too full, I forgo the meat and at LEAST try to finish the bread.  The Fried Chicken is great too.  The Seoul Sassy is the most popular and my personal favorite but in general all of them rock!  On top of  great tasting food the service here is superb. Employees are eager to serve often bringing your order TO you and offering to clear your table afterwords. They are a friendly bunch, always smiling and wanting to get to know more about you.

2009-02-21,4.0,"This place is somewhat of an interesting establishment. I've lived only a few blocks from here on Pine Grove and Diversey some years back. Before it was called ""Crisp"", it was just a place with Korean food and sushi. Not to say of course that it was bad at all, because it wasn't. Prior to it's makeover, you could tell the establishment was fairly new and they were just getting used to their feet wet. Their menu had your general variety of Korean foods, pure and traditional in every sort of way. It was always funny to see the ol' man telling the Mexican cooks how to make the bulgogi with utter scrutiny. Can't blame him - he wants his customers to experience the real deal. I practically went here at least 3 times a week. I moved up further north and moaned the loss of such a reliable, tasty, and friendly establishment. I come back around the area shopping, happen to pass by and notice it's closed down, with all the windows covered up. They're renovating. ""Awesome"", I say to myself. They finally opened up, with a brand new menu selection and revamped decor. Oh how I was disappointed. One can never really figure out the circumstances behind any change a business makes. I can take a slight guess however. Diversey and Clark is drowning with your average variety of downtown workers who are in their 20's and 30's, living the life. ""Yuppies"" so to speak? Very american, very metro. It's definitely a customer base that has high expectations. So the new change? I get it. It is a business after all. Despite however you might interpret this review, I really like this place. They still serve some of the same meals they did prior to the make over. But then there's some of the new items that are off the wall and rather degrading. Yes, I refer to their menu section, "" You so crazy? Korean Burritos"". My grandmother would have a heart attack if she saw crap like this and knew even a lick of american euphemisms that stereotype Asians. Of course I don't take it seriously, it's all fun and all. I get it. But I personally don't think they had to go so far as to lose their dignity with silly concoctions i.e. Dakota Seoul Steak (Philly Cheese? Are you serious?? Philly Cheese and asian food stopped being friends when some idiot decided to invent the Philly Cheese Roll)? Ultimately, it's a tough call personally. What I did order, which was the Buddha which natives know as the Bi-Bim Bop, was very good. And the same folks before the renovation were still there, just as nice and hospitable as before. Go hit the place up. If you're looking for a fun time with an interesting introduction to korean cuisine, dashed with some awkward pairings of american recipes - it'll make your stomach fit right in. But if you're looking for real Korean food, think a little elsewhere.

I opted for the organic brown rice, which was a dollar or so more, and man, I have never had rice like that before. It was sticky and had a great flavor to it. The veggies and the egg on top were good too. At first I thought I might not have enough sauce because they just gave my one little tiny plastic container vs. other places where I usually get the whole bottle. But, it was plenty and it tasted great. The only downside would be the size of the place and the table layout. It is a small place with seating at the window and three large picnic tables. When we went one picnic table was taken by the owners (?) or managers (?) who were actually being quite loud and annoying- slamming notebooks on the table and talking loudly. Really, guys, not good for business. When we were ready to sit, there was one whole table free, so it was fine. However, you may want to plan to take your meal to go as there may not be enough seating. Overall, great place, good food. I would definitely go back.",0.991,0.801,0.18,0.019,0.5003501400560225

I also enjoy their fried chicken, usually the half-chicken is enough for a meal, or the lunch special wings and fries.  I prefer the Crisp BBQ sauce (seems based on the red bibimbop sauce) but the Seoul Sassy has a much more Asian feel and is still good. My other staple is the Original Bad Boy Buddha Bowl - the Bibimbop with a bunch of veggies and a fried egg, paying extra for beef and organic brown rice.  It's a little filling, but oh so good.

2009-01-06,2.0,"All this hype about some super duper crispy chicken. Let's get one fact straight first, the way I heard it, when they opened, their flavors were Korean style. Once they realized business was crappy, they changed their flavors to accommodate American palates. I wish I'd tried it when they first opened I think I would've appreciated their flavors a lot more. These new flavors are bleh to me. I live on the North side where Korean food is within an arms reach. Seoul sassy was the only flavor that kind of appealed. The chicken was so very crispy, many times throughout the experience it was said over and over by all that I ate with. I wish they offered Soju, since I'm used to having Tong Dak with Soju at Korean bars.  WTF is Northside pomme frites? It is NOT prepared like pomme frites, it's freakin' plain style French fries. That's it. I would've skipped the French fries had I known better. Their coleslaw, I'd hoped would be Korean style, it wasn't, it was like any coleslaw found anywhere, another wasted purchase. None of the sides were any appealing and the bowls were just bleh to me, as well. Like Luan N. mentioned, rice has an additional charge WTF? It's just sticky rice.. Brown rice ok, but sticky? The sides just don't make sense.. also at these Americanized joints, why do you have to charge for kim chi? EEssshhh 18!!  If I happen in here again I think I'd try the chicken plain and maybe try a bul kogi burrito, cuz bul kogi is bangin' and not something anyone can F up.  Fuck the fusion part, bring back the Korean style.  I found this on the Internet so for some of you that care, you've got the Korean names of this style of chicken; "" There are the battered wings, served plain (Dak Nal Gae, ""chicken wings"") or brushed with garlic, soy, pepper, whatever sauce (Mae Woon Dak Nal Gae ""spicy chicken wings""). Then there's the deep-fried whole chicken (Tong Dak, ""whole chicken""), cut into pieces, with the thin, crackly and almost transparent crust. "" Tong dak can be found at a few Korean bars on the North side.  P.S., from a person that's had a crap load of this kind of chicken, it does not carry out well.

I had been badgering Mr Man to try this place for ages, which is odd, since I am not really a fan of wings. However, Mr Man is a MADMAN for wings, and I thought he would like them. I know, I am so selfless.  We actually ordered takeout to bring over to our friends' place for dinner. This was a great idea, because it meant we got to try a BUNCH of stuff, yay! The guy who took our order was really helpful, and gave great suggestions on what to get AND how much to get for 4 people.  I believe we ordered a half chicken and 10 wings, so we got to try all 3 of the sauces. We also ordered a Buddha Bowl and a burrito.  The wings are really big here, because they keep all 3 parts of the wing together, instead of separating them. I really like the BBQ sauce, but I think my favorite is the Seoul Sassy! I like the sweet soy flavor! The buffalo was too much for me, but my spice-loving boyf really liked them. I just licked my finger after just picking up a buffalo wing and putting it on my plate, and that little lick made my tongue tingle! (OK people, get your minds out of the gutter!) By the time I finished eating it, my lips were numb. The thing I REALLY liked about all the chicken is that the skin was nice and crispy (hence the name!), even with the sauce on them. I hate slimy grody chicken skin.  The Big Boy Buddha bowl was OK. If you really like veggies, you'll like it. I thought it coulda used more sauce, and more rice. But I am spoiled and I prefer bibimbop in the stone bowls. It's just not the same without that yummy crispy rice on the bottom!  Surprisingly, we all LOVED the burrito! We got the Seoul Sensation, because Mr Man and I love Bulgogi! I was skeptical at first. I mean, seriously, Korean burrito? I'm all about fusion, but that just sounds silly!

2008-11-28,5.0,"Here are a few comments I see repeatedly written about Crisp that I'd like to clear up: 1. ""Ohmigod, the Buddha Bowl was LUKEWARM!"" - Crisp's Buddha Bowl is essentially Korean bibimbap. It is served cool/room temperature (like Crisp's) or in a hot stone bowl (dol sot bibimbap). It is supposed to be this way. If you do not like this, go to a Korean joint that serves the dol sot variety. Just because American food isn't served this way doesn't make it wrong- become informed about Korean food before criticizing it. 2. ""IT'S NOT HEALTHY!"" - Nobody is claiming this stuff is diet food. They're a Korean-American fast food joint. They are selling fried chicken wings, french fries, onion rings, and fried mushrooms. If you're concerned about your bibimbap having a little sesame oil in it, please know that  it contains vitamin e (an anti-oxidant), it helps lower cholesterol, and it also contains magnesium, copper, calcium, iron and vitamin B6.

I ordered the Bad Boy Buddha bowl and asked for it without oil. I thought this meant they would steam the vegetables, but apparently not. All (or most) vegetables are marinated in the morning and he can't make any exceptions/special orders (I'm sure he would but I would have to call very far in advance and pay a hefty service charge). I get my vegetables and there is oil on them and I ask him about it, he said he thought I meant the extra squirt they put on top before serving. No. So we had the conversation resuting in the info presented at the beginning of this paragraph. Still I ate it and it was good. What's an additional estimated 20-25 grams of fat with my veggies, anyway? And its sesame oil, not like, lard.

2008-11-15,5.0,"Korean fried chicken (KFC) is a favorite topic of mine. But KFC was the last thing on my mind when I started planning this trip until I started reading about Crisp on various food blogs and Web sites. So on our second day in Chicago, having tackled White Castle and Greek food the night before, I skipped out on the city's pizza, hot dogs, and Italian beef sandwiches and headed to Lakeview for some KFC. The essence of Korean fried chicken lies in its sauces and Crisp has three different offerings (Crisp BBQ, Seoul Sassy, and Bud's Buffalo). We ordered two whole chickens and went for the Crisp BBQ and the Seoul Sassy. The Crisp BBQ is a Korean sauce that's got a mild heat, which was nice because other spicy KFC sauces I've had have totally blown out my taste buds. If you're like us and like trying different flavors of KFC, then you'll appreciate that even more. The heat does linger on your tongue, and I love that. As much as we liked the Crisp BBQ sauce, the Seoul Sassy was our favorite. The ginger, garlic, and soy-based sauce was excellent, one of my favorite KFC sauces ever. This basket of chicken disappeared faster than that Crisp BBQ. Sauces aside, the most important thing about this fried chicken is that it lives up to its name. The chicken skin is crispy, despite being drowned in sauce, and it's juicy too. I'm pretty confident that most fried chicken fans could order the sauceless Plain Jane chicken and be very happy. We got a chance to talk to Jae Lee, one of Crisp's owners, and he was really cool. I told him that we don't have Korean Fried Chicken like this in the SF Bay Area and that this rivaled the KFC we had in New York. Jae told us that he went to New York as part of his research and sampled pretty much everything they had to offer. Because of our conversation, our next New York trip is going to feature a trip to Unidentified Flying Chickens in Jackson Heights. But if you're in Chicago, definitely check out Crisp if you're looking for some excellent Korean fried chicken.

For lunch, I took the Korean beef burrito with brown rice substitute to go. The burrito itself was huge, think Chipotle huge, and full of freshly prepared ingredients and tons of beef pilled high. The only downside was that the burrito itself was extremely sweet, and while I know most Korean beef is prepared this way, it was almost sickly sweet like a dessert. I was expecting it to be just a little bit more savory. The sauce placed on the side gave it a bit more kick and balanced things out a bit, according to my bf. My only other critique of Crisp is that there menu is a bit small with only about 3-4 choices underneath each category, but they do have a store front location on Broadway, and it's not really a sit down place.

I'm glad we got some plain, so we could taste the seasoning and not just sauce. Though the BBQ was very nice -- a little sweet, a little spicy. When we got there (about 6:30) the place was empty, and by the time we got our food, it was full.

Just so  you get the  full picture.   I decided to try Crisp today with a friend who had been craving some fried chicken.  I was game, why not-try something new, break the habits, experience life.  Ya, it was just lunch, and we can all do without another sandwich in our lives.    I ordered the lunch special- total of $6.97 with tax, and WAY more food than I could consume.  Three HUGE wings, fries, and a can of my preference.  Let me tell you, these were HEALTHY BIRDS.  They flew HIGH and LONG before their demise.  They had MEAT on their BONES.   Well, the BONES- they were a problem.  See, I am one of those persnickety eaters who likes to think that meat is manufactured at some factory, and never, ever wants to see bones attached. You could say that I have a FOOD BONE phobia.  I know the truth ( my grandmother owned a locker plant, I was often the city kid locked in back with the sides of beef and pork as a prank by my uncles, this may have something to do with my phobia).  Being polite, and somewhat hungry and curious, I was determined to attempt this food, bones and all.  To eat these monster wings, I had my choice of chopsticks (not an option unless someone wanted to get hurt), a plastic fork, and my fingers.  Um, nope, I could not handle my fingers, so the plastic fork was my tool of choice.  Ironically enough, Bryan Adams was belting out ""Cuts like a knife"" on the oldies radio- and the fork worked!! The chicken was tender enough that a plastic fork- for the most part- was able to tackle the job! I tried the Korean BBQ.  It was spicy and nice. Not too hot, and did not burn.  I had a taste of the Seoul blend from my friends.  It was good too.  I ended up consuming 2 of my wings, tossing one to my friend, and trying a part of one of hers.  All in all, a fantastic lunch. I do think I misordered.  They had some FANTASTIC looking bowl combos- with veggies, brown rice, etc.  Next time, I am heading for that, I am confident it will be good, and know that I do not have to deal with my bone phobia!",0.9908,0.84,0.129,0.031,0.6046991341991341

2008-06-05,5.0,"I came here to add another chicken joint to my list since this place has garnered some positive reviews, so I braved the hellacious parking in the area.  The service was very nice and friendly, set up is small, clean and communal, but perfectly fine if you are not super intimidated by strangers.  The spot seems mostly set up for take out at any rate.  They have coolers full of a wide variety of drinks for you to purchase as well. Alright enough of that, onto the chicken.  Crisp uses two sizes of chicken here.  For those ordering whole or half chickens here, they use small frying chickens, for those ordering wings they use the super large variety.  I sampled the plain, seoul sassy, and korean bbq varieties (hey I take this seriously).  The chicken is cooked very well, nice and crisp but not overdone, they do not come out very oily (which is a good sign since food only absorbs frying oil if the oil is not hot enough or if the food has run out of moisture) the oil used is very neutral.  The plain chicken is subtly spiced and has a nice light coating and crunch, I can't really place the spice, but it definitly has a korean twist to it, even plain.  The thighs here are cut into two pieces and the breasts are on the small side as well, so it makes for a very different eating experience than your standared fried chicken cuts.  I do suppose the small piece size aids in reducing cooking times and avoiding burning or undercooking when different sized pieces are cooked together.  The plain, reheats quite well, possible due to to its relatively light battering. If you order the ""wings"" here, you get the whole wing, all together, instead of just drumettes and flats.  The larger wings are cooked very well and are gargantuan, and a very good value for the price, whereass half/whole chickens are priced a bit steep considering the size.  The Seoul Sassy was my favorite sauce, its nice a sweet, with some nice flavor, the sauce is golden (reminiscent of glaze) and comes with some green onion bits as garnish.  The Korean BBW is a fiery red, it is also sweet, has a nice hot kick (somewhere between a medium an hot) and comes sprinkled with sesame for looks.  I have not sampled thier take on buffalo sauce yet, by I suspect I will sooner or later.  Impressively neither of the sauces ruin the crispness of the wings (at least when fresh), which is quite important with the crisp style of the wing. Other observions.  Had the mushrooms, they were good and plentiful, but not really exceptional, the breading is dense and sticks to the mushroom itself, which is nice.  Ordered a side of rice.  The rice is of the very sticky variety like Japenese sushi rice.  Very good.  I'm intrigued by the beef bulgogi on the menu (I love bulgogi), I'll be back to try that. All in all I give the place 5 stars for selection, sauce, and quality of the cooked chicken, specifically the wings.  If it was the whole chicken alone, then maybe 4 stars, but this place excels at the small details; packaging, service and selection all factor in to making this a 5 star chicken joint.",0.9979,0.772,0.18,0.048,0.6090388579674294

For those of you who know well the smell I speak of, you know there's nothing like it in all world. Even if I had just eaten an enormous dinner, I'd smell the eu de crispyness and say to my other half, ""Man, we've really got to go to that chicken place. It smells SO GOOD"".  So, finally we made our trek over their last week. I decided it was the perfect opportunity to partake in fried goodness, as I needed to 'lay a foundation' pre-Nisei drinking or, as the boyfriend calls it, 'harden my arteries'.

Not exactly the wardrobe choice for barbecue fans the world over. Not so much. Luckily, I decided to play it safe and just get their 'plain jane' wings with the sauces on the side. My shirt survived unscathed. Mike got the 1/2 barbecue chicken. Everything tasted good, but we both found the meat to be a little lacking. Now, this may be due to the fact that, unlike KFC, Crisp uses real animals when making their food and not genetic-mutant-headless-full o' meat-freak birds, but worth mentioning anyway.  I liked the communal seating, how everything was super clean, the choice of beverages, and the BYOB option. The owner at the counter was extremely friendly and nice, and offered to show us some of the orders coming out so that we could gauge what size/ type of item we should get. He also followed up and made sure to ask us what we thought of everything, which I really appreciate.

2008-03-31,4.0,"Fried chicken isn't really something I'm gonna eat on a regular basis, but I give major kudos to this place for creating a niche and doing it really well.  1) Don't go to this place if you have to, say, go try on clothes afterwards. The minute you walk in, you are saturated with the smell of the sauces, and it's gonna take a while for that to wear off.  2) The space is small but cute, with bright walls and communal tables. At 2pm on a Saturday, it was busy but we had no problem getting a seat. 3) The owners and staff are really helpful. Walking by the other day we stopped to look at a menu. A worker quickly came out with a to-go menu and let us know they also deliver. When we ate there our total was $8.12. We gave the cashier $10 and he gave us $2 even back (which of course we put in the tip jar). They now take credit cards.  4) It's cheaper to get fries and a drink added then to just order a side of fries. And they have diet root beer - bonus! 5) The food itself is damn tasty. We shared the Seoul Sassy sandwhich. The sauce was excellent, though I'd ask for no cheese next time (it didn't add anything to the flavor). At $8 for sandwich, fries and drink, it's a quality, tasty and inexpensive meal.",0.9796,0.798,0.146,0.056,0.4532451923076923
2008-03-29,5.0,"Today I came in and met Doug, who I presume to be an owner or at least a half-owner. I start my review by saying this because I think it's significant; your first impression of Crisp will be that it's a trendy type of place but is run by a very down-to-earth owner. He will ask you for your name and then for your order. I came in for the chicken wings, which were delicious. They're fried and covered in several sauces. Out of the sauces I had, the Seoul Sassy was tasty and on the milder side, while the Crisp BBQ was a lot spicier and bolder. The latter had much of the same spicy flavor you would find in kimchi (without the fermented taste, of course), but also had a sweet component like a BBQ sauce. I may have liked them a bit spicier, even, to balance out the sweet, but I think fans of BBQ wings will like these a lot. My fries were a little soggy by the time they got to my place, but that's just what happens to fried foods in transit. All in all, really great wings with inventive sauces. You can have a half or whole chicken done this way too. I think what Crisp has done well is pander to the crowd without losing its roots. The food is definitely Am-Asian, but the flavors which are put into their burritos and wings are those which are very reminiscnet of a typical Korean meal (at least from what I've had of that cuisine.) You can even get a bibimbap bowl (there called a 'buddha bowl') with their own twist. The combo of trendy modern with down-to-earth people and of traditional Korean flavors with familiar American cuisine is why this restaurant is such a success. The food is unique and different, yet still comforting. If you're in the area, this is a place to check out, especially if you're tired of eating pre-frozen wings in soul-less sports bars.",0.9937,0.839,0.149,0.012,0.5423076923076924

And that, is most definitely what Crisp is. Eight of us flooded the joint, among the other people in the restaurant, scouring the menus to find the perfect fried chicken option. George and I noticed as we approached the counter that the gigantic flat screen TV up front was listing meal options, so we immediately opted for the meal deals, but look quick! For the picture changes pretty rapidly.  Feeling like a professional, I walked up to the counter and ordered the Funke #2 (or was it 3) -- Five Chicken Wings (your choice of flavor/sauce) with the house-made potato salad and coleslaw. I opted for the Buffalo Bud's because I'm a whore for Buffalo-style chicken, and I got it ""spicy"" -- the middle option of the spicy scale at Crisp. The guy at the counter suggested I order the fries, because the potato salad is COLD, so I agreed and got the fries.  The food came out incredibly fast, and as Mike looked on, I bit into the chicken wing. It was spicy, more spicy than I was expecting, but interestingly, the spice wore off. Each wing after that that I ate just wasn't as spicy as that first one -- did I adjust? Was it just the initial shock of spice? Either way, after that, it just wasn't the same.  As oft-readers of Chavi know, I'm also a whore for coleslaw, and I usually gauge a restaurant by how well they can make a batch of coleslaw. I was expecting some alternate type of slaw, perhaps with an Asian flare or something, so when I got the coleslaw -- which, mind you, is completely pureed -- I was pretty disappointed. It had a good taste, it was your typical, basic coleslaw, but the lack of creativity and the fact that it was PUREED completely grossed me out. Coleslaw is meant to have a certain texture, and that is not one of puree. This, folks, is the result of a loss of a half star.  As far as the fries, well, they were your basic, greasy stringy fries. Nothing special, nothing unique. I know it's an Asian fried chicken joint, but I was expecting a dash of something. This, of course, is the result of the loss of another half star.  So I'm dishing out four stars, because the chicken -- the tour de force -- was really amazing, spicy or not. The joint is clean and crisp (har har har) and the staff was super friendly and amusing, not to mention that they listen to their customer's every want and need.

2008-02-27,3.0,Unfortunately I can't eat spicy things and the plain fried chicken didn't look so appetizing to me so I went ahead and ordered a salad and some fries.  The salad dressing is homemade dressing with a little zing and it was actually really good.  My fries came out kind of cold and that was the reason I didn't get the smashed tators cause they were cold.  But all in all my meal was good.   On that note I did sample everyone elses foods so that I could write an accurate review.  The coleslaw was some kind of ground up mess.  It had flavor and seemed pretty decent but it was the consistency of baby food.  Yuck!  The cold smashed tators were actually really good!  And I have a feeling that if you warmed them they would be sinfully good!  I smelled everyone's chicken.  Yes that's right smelled!  I can tell if I can eat something spicy by the smell and none of it I could eat!  It was all way too spicy for me and didn't even smell good but it did look good and everyone seemed to be enjoying. Service was nice and helpful but at the same time I thought a little over bearing. I was one of the first people to order and when I was standing there with my friend she ordered ranch to go with her wings and I thought the man taking our order was gonna die.  In the end he won and talked her out of the ranch and I don't think she needed it but still it was a 5 minute conversation on to ranch or not to ranch. I wish I liked this place more but I think what I really liked about it was the company and not the food.,0.9941,0.779,0.185,0.036,0.680873015873016

I started reviewing the menu days in advance to try to decide what I wanted to get.  When I finally arrived I finally turned to a pussy and ordered the plain jane fried chicken. The chicken was solid. It wasn't the greatest that I had, but it was above average. From hearing what others were saying, I probably could have taken the next step up in sauce without my spice-o-phobia kicking in.  We ordered a side of mushrooms and what can i say, they were fried mushrooms. What I really enjoyed were the smashed potatoes. They serve them chilled which originally stuck me as odd, but when I tried them, I was thoroughly impressed. I am not sure what they put in them but they were delicious, even served chilled.  I have a feeling that the owner was the guy taking the orders. He was very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. I was also impressed that he warned us about the potatoes. He checked up on us several times and made sure we were doing OK. He really went out of his way to be sure we were enjoying ourselves.He even changed the radio station when he overheard us saying what a crappy song was playing.  I sure hope they continue this habit of good service.",0.9826,0.731,0.179,0.09,0.6434729952587096
2008-02-26,3.0,"A bunch of Yelpers inspired by Rocky's ROTD decided to put this place though the paces tonight.  I thought about ordering the Seoul Sassy in honor of my birthplace but I ended up ordering the ""suicide"" Bud's Buffalo wings as I have a reputation to maintain (GO HOT HEADS!).   When I asked the guy taking my order how hot the ""insane"" was, he took a deep breath and looked me dead in my eye and said ""they're HOT"".  Some of my crew ordered the ""spicy"" and it looked and smelled good so I knew I was on the right track. The ""suicide"" wings looked like the ""suicide"" wings at Buffalo Joes in that they were topped w/ a healthy portion of sauce and jalapenos on top of the wings.  The ""suicide"", sadly, were not hot.  As a matter of fact, they weren't even spicy. Hot Heads: 1 Crisp: 0 Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals so that was a good sign.  I recommend you reading the other reviews if you want a non Hot Head take on the place.  If you're into spicy meals, you're better off looking elsewhere for your fiery delights. +1 for having chilled Bacchus D available.",0.9725,0.763,0.174,0.063,0.6413690476190476

2008-02-25,4.0,"Read about Crisp on the Reader and tried it last night. Happy to say that it was delicious! Plus Korean chicken joint right in my neighborhood? Even better. Ordered Crsip BBQ chicken, and Seoul Sassy chicken, the spinach salad and one of the 'buds'.  Their names of the dishes are kind of confusing, like... what the hell is 'buds'?! (They're dumplings). Not really sure where they got ideas to name their dishes, but non the less everything we ordered was good.  Crisp BBQ chicken is spicy and sweet. Probably closest to a typical Korean flavor, the sauce has 'go-chu-jang' which is the korean spicy sauce. I think the sauce was made with go-chu-jang and honey.  Seoul Sassy was very sweet. Think of any teriyaki flavored chicken wings you've had in the past. I wouldn't recommend ordering a whole chicken of one flavor. Go half and try a couple different flavors.  The best part, however, is the skin! My god is it crispy. I was biting off every possible little piece of skin attached to the bone. None of the grease, and all of crispiness.  The Buds are good as well, definitely one of the better dumplings out there. The sauce that comes with is slightly sweet and different.  Salad was... eh. okay. they cook the mushroom a bit with sesame oil so that adds a nice aroma and flavor.  Korean style fried chicken, when done right, is the best thing ever. It's never fatty, super crispy, and seasoned just right. Unfortunately, Crisp isn't it. For those who are familiar with Korean style chicken, you won't get it at Crisp. BUT Crisp is definitely good, so it's worth a try.  Bottom line, their chicken reminded me of Harold's, if Harold's was sauced. That's a good thing.",0.996,0.741,0.213,0.045,0.6008045440398382

2008-02-18,4.0,"So I ordered from here having no idea what to expect. I didn't know that Koreans had their own special niche of fried chicken. I also have no idea what bi bim bop is. But I do know that I seriously love fried chicken in all of it's forms. We got a half chicken of the plain jane, as well as some Seoul Sassy wings.  The plain jane is seriously, seriously plain. I feel like they should have a disclaimer on the menu : 'We mean it when we say plain - no really. Get some sauce with this."" The batter didn't have much taste to it, so it was my own dumb fault for not getting some sauce. The chicken comes in small pieces, not a whole breast and a leg or whatnot that you might be expecting. However - the chicken was perfectly cooked, and very yummy once I threw a little sauce on it. My only quam was that it was some tiny little bones in there. I'm just grossed out by chicken bones. My own weird thing. So if you're expecting some KFC out of this place, you're wrong. But in a good way. Now the wings- Oh my god, the wings. It's a whole, huge, giant wing. I'd hate to see the chicken this wing came off of, it must have been 6 feet tall. The wings were amazingly crispy, even after coming through a sauce bath. The 'Seoul Sassy'  sauce was awesome! It was sweet and spicy and tasted a little bit like soy sauce, and didn't leave the chicken dripping. Just the right amount of sauce. So so so good.  Also, the owners / workers / whoever was there are the nicest! They also seem to take great care in packing up the chicken so it stays crispy by the time you get it home. It was also really good, and still crispy, after I put it through the torture that is my microwave, for some late night seconds. I'll definitely be back here to try the rest of the sauces.",0.9809,0.768,0.149,0.083,0.6737475198412697

The owner, Doug, was super nice and outgoing without being pushy. As I  was eating, he asked me if it he could tell me about the chicken--he didn't just talk talk talk...he asked permission :) I was in the mood for wings, and I was truthfully walking down the street to Avenue Tavern. I took a peek at the menu in the window (the wording is slightly confusing to me) and went in. The ""giant wings"" are in fact the entire wing, all three segments. So an order of 5 is like an order of 10 everywhere else.  The breading is the signature here. Very very thin and very crisp. I usually eschew breading on wings, but this was very good. The wing sauce is unique here, not your usual half Franks Red Hot, half butter. This was more of an Asian chili paste-based sauce. Very good, even if it wasn't exactly what I had in mind.  I'll be back to try the other sauces, and also I want to try the beef bolgogi burrito. Yum.",0.9694,0.859,0.135,0.006,0.5393295019157086
2008-02-11,5.0,"This place provides a unique spin on korean food which was really cool to see and taste.  The Seoul Sassy chicken is excellent.  It was fresh, very crispy, and the flavor was awesome.  The same goes for the Crisp chicken which has a spicy/sweet flavor.  Having gone with a group of friends, we also tried Bad Boy Buddha, which is basically a Bi-Bim-Bap, which was pretty tasty as well, and came in a decent sized portion.  Lastly , I tried the Seoul Sensation burrito.  The bul-go-gi had an authentic and good tasting marinade and made my stomach happy.

2008-02-03,2.0,"I'm torn about writing this review. I really want my fellow Koreans to succeed, but this place really gives Korean chicken a bad, bad name.  The owners are so super nice and seem to be trying extremely hard (annoyingly hard as Nicole R mentions...).  I was so excited to hear that this place opened, but I'm afraid that it won't be in business for long...   The whole point of Korean fried chicken is that the fat is rendered out of the skin (please read my Bon Chon review) and still remains very moist and super crispy.  The is was not the case with Crisp's chicken.  It was super fatty.  The skin was basically unedible, and folks, that should be the best part of Korean fried chicken.  The sauces were sooo salty on the smaller pieces and super bland on the larger pieces.  I also had a big breast chunk that was undercooked. If you want the real thing, please head to NYC, Los Angeles, or Seoul.  I'm actually embarrassed for Crisp that they're putting the ""Korean Fried Chicken"" label on their chicken. I thought that I wouldn't have to travel for Korean fried chicken (KFC) anymore, but was I wrong!  I guess if you've never had the real thing, you may actually think it is ok - ignorance is bliss!!!",0.9909,0.689,0.217,0.094,0.5824324324324325

2008-01-29,3.0,"For anyone who has never had Korean chicken wings (or GASP! never had Korean food at all!), this is a good starter.  I could do without the cheesy names, but if a name like Seoul Sassy will get more people to try the perfect combination of sweet, salty flavors highlighting the fried chicken, then Seoul Sassy it is.  We had the Seoul Sassy and Plain Jane wings, with sides of the other sauces to try them all; Seoul Sassy wins by a long shot - Plain Jane really is plan and seems boring by comparison, although if you had it on it's own I'm sure it's fine -- nice and crispy, for certain. Service is friendly, and they've repainted and spruced it up since the Rice Box days, making it a more pleasant environment overall.  The owner was nice enough to bring us a plate of ""The Green and The Orange"" - but.... the veggies were soggy, not crisp or fresh, and the ranch dressing on the side was clearly bottled. I haven't tried other items on the menu, but it seems to me like they're suffering from too many choices.  Wings, sandwiches, burritos (a bi bi bop burrito?), salads, rice bowls and ""buds""  -- which can be steamed, fried or pan fried -- left me confused about what their ""specialties"" were.  (On a side note:  $10 for a bowl of rice and veggies -- essentially a veggie bi bim bop without the traditional fried egg -- seems like a lot for me -- and the meat is still extra...). Definitely come for the chicken -- and hopefully, given some time, they'll figure out the rest.

I loved both. The crust on the chicken was nice and light...not overwhelming at all. The sauce on both types was very flavorful. The spicy isn't the type of spicy where you need to be concerned if you aren't into heat. It's more of a tingly flavor. Along with our fried chicken we also received ranch dressing, celery and....korean potato salad. Woo the potato salad was yummy and a nice accompaniment to the wings. The owner was very friendly and welcoming. The restaurant itself is set up for communal seating. There are about 3 big picnic style type tables that will seat about 8 people each and then counters that line the wall and window with stool seating. I actually like the communal seating set up. We sat across from this lady that was actually the sanitation inspector for the place that came to check out the food. She was pretty interesting and we shared tips on other restaurants to try out that served spicy foods.  I'm very happy that this place is finally open. Granted I still will miss Rice Box but the owner assured me that there will be some items from the Rice Box menu that will show up on Crisp's.  He said his goal is to make korean food more friendly to the masses that aren't quite used to korean cuisine.  I can't wait to try out more of their menu. Look for a full opening later in the week.",0.982,0.869,0.127,0.005,0.5574404761904762
