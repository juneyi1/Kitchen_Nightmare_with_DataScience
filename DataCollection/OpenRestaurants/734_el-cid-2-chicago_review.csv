Glad they didn't go away with the old menu and old prices. I get it the neighborhood has changed and you gotta go with the changes but some of the items prices have gone through extreme price changes. I also get that prices in their ingredients go up so they have to charge extra. Totally get it but some of their dishes have gone up about $10 more than before. And not just over time but rather, over night. This used to be my go to spot with my friends then later with my husband and son until they changed their prices. Now it's only when I'm really in the mood for a shrimp cocktail or a sope. Otherwise, we have another great Mexican restaurant that we frequent now because their prices are very reasonable and have daily specials and it's just down the street.

2017-05-23,4.0,"While visiting the Chicago-Rosemont area this past week, a friend suggested we head over to El Cid in Logan Square, for some Mexican food. The restaurant itself is very easy to spot. They have an outside patio in the front, as well as one in the back (as I was told). Dogs are welcomed at this location, but if you bring your hairy friend, know that you are only allowed to sit in the front outside patio area only. The waitress we had was alright. Half of the time we were left sitting and waiting for long periods of time to get more water, napkins, etc. Anywho, the food was pretty okay as well. I ordered the Taco Dinner, which consisted of 3 tacos filled with cilantro, onions, cheese, lettuce, and chicken (Note: You can choose your meat and the toppings), and Spanish rice and pinto beans. The tacos were served on soft corn tortillas. I enjoyed the tacos. The meat was seasoned very well! The rice and beans were also pretty delicious as well! You must try the green salsa on your food. It is just the right amount of spice and flavor! The prices were very reasonable, especially for the quality of the food that is served. I would recommend if you are in the area. Oh and if you come with a group of I think 5 or more, an 18% gratuity is automatically added to your check. Also, if you are in a group of more than 5, you are only allowed to pay with a max of two cards. So if you are hoping to split the check, make sure everyone has cash available.

2017-05-15,4.0,"It was Cinco de Mayo, so El Cid I descend upon. I figured it'd be busy and it was. There's a decent amount of seating upstairs and downstairs. They have a front patio AND a backyard, but it was too cold for anyone to be outside. We put our name on the list and they said the wait would be about 45 minutes or so. Here I am thinking...that's enough for me to get a drink and probably even finish it and they opened up the bar upstairs for those who had their name on the list. Win! We ended up only having to wait about 30 minutes. Service was decent. It took a while for us to actually get our order in, but our server was MIA for a while. She had a massive table next to us that she was also serving. However, once we ordered, it was fairly seamless. So the crazy part was that it took a bit for us to get our house margaritas (on special for $5). The margaritas were pretty delicious. The food on everyone's table looked even better. I'm not going to lie, but it tasted a bit better than sour mix margarita, but it wasn't super spectacular or anything. I'd probably still get them here though. They had flavors too which looked pretty tasty. So, that's enough about the margaritas...I'm here for the tacos. I hear they are good. They are a good price AND they're a good size also. Their rice and beans are pretty good when you get the combo meal. The beans I would say are better than the rice. I really liked the two salsas that come complimentary...not so much the chips, but they're also pretty good. They were kind of just plain. The tacos tacos were a good size. Bigger than the super hipster, double tortilla tacos, and smaller than the Americanized tacos. They were a good size. I ordered three just in case and that was actually rather filling. They use corn tortillas that are able to maintain their structure, which was nice. I got al pastor, steak and carnitas (I think). The al pastor and carnitas I wanted to be better. The steak was delicious. I think some of it comes down to preference.  TLDR: it's worth checking out.

2016-11-05,4.0,"Over the summer, right after I moved to Logan Square, I talked to someone who waxed poetic about El Cid. He had moved to Florida and every time he came back to Chicago, he always had to eat at El Cid. And I can understand why. By no means is El Cid a trendy restaurant. Their menu is standard Mexican fare. Their flavors are not unique. Their restaurant design is not inspiring. From this, you would probably expect me to rate El Cid negatively. But I could never do that. Because El Cid is a fantastic restaurant. Right off the square, El Cid could've been a weird, hipster, fusion restaurant. But it's not. And that's what makes it amazing. It's standard fare in an unassuming restaurant. This is the kind of place where you can be a regular.  I've been here four times with four different groups of people and everyone has loved it. I love to try new restaurants but when someone comes to visit me in Logan Square, I try to steer them here. Their tacos are delicious, the enchiladas are delicious, their burritos are delicious, their quesadillas are delicious, their pico de gallo is delicious, and their salsa verde is delicious. Personally, I'm in love with their skirt steak quesadilla dinner. The skirt steak is flavorful in the way you want your skirt steak to be. Their queso blanco is melted perfectly. And all those haters who rant about their refried beans - I don't get you. It's yummy and it reminds me of home and I always clean my plate.  I've also had their margaritas and I have no complaints. The raspberry ones are great and so are the strawberry ones. I didn't get the top shelf tequila the first time I ordered them and I probably never will. Because they taste just fine the way they are.

2016-06-03,2.0,"So- I don't know why dogs are only allowed on the front patio and not the back. There's nothing being prepared in the back patio- I think it's just because they wanted to fill up the front and not have to send servers to the back today. But, ok. I'd like to see why that's a law- which is what I was told. You also don't have to pass through the restaurant to get there- you never go inside in order to get to the back patio. Whatever. Anyways, we waited- once moved to the front- about 10 minutes for a server. Then we ordered our drinks, guac, and extra salsa (the green tastes fishy to me, and the pico/salsa comes in a container that is about 1-2 oz- and I can go through that with about 3 chips). That salsa- the extra- came about a half hour later. We spent nearly 2.5 hours there. When we got there, there were 3 servers on duty as far as we can see, and others who were doing who knows what. There was one table occupied inside. Leaving at about 645pm, there were maybe 3 more tables outside with patrons. My friend had to go inside twice to ask for service- we were really hungry. We were never offered water (in 2.5 hours). The second person that came out- after my friend had to go inside to get someone to serve us after at least 20 minutes of waiting) came out and was- sweet, but also said ""you're not my table and I don't know where your server is but I'll get someone out here."" Ok- how about you find out who that is, out of the three of you, and send her out. I literally never saw the first server we had again. The second server we had (who, again, our table wasn't ""Hers"") ended up serving us. She was nice but.... this food- come on. It's quesadillas and tacos. You've already made that chicken, beef, shredded the cheese and cooked the beans. By no means should it take over a half hour for 3 tacos and a quesadilla. It shouldn't take you 10 minutes to get us another thing of chips and salsa (there were probably 15-20 chips in a basket- and again that salsa... hello,  less than 2oz? seriously?).  Did I mentioned the green salsa tastes fishy? And the guac is a quantity over quality situation. It's watery as all hell, and completely tasteless. It was like- an old onion, some kind of sad avocados with no flavor, and an old tomato- no garlic or lime- no spices. Bland as hell. This would be AMAZING if it was 2am and I was drunk and didn't care. But that wasn't the situation today as I am no longer 24 years old, FFS. If you have more servers than tables, please don't take 10+ minutes to serve us drinks, chips, or salsa- and if I ask you for extra salsa before you bring anything to our table- please bring it with the chips and salsa and not 15 minutes later when I have to ask you for the second time for extra salsa. JFC. It was my second time there- and good laws. Those signs in the back- you know- sassy service signs (if you want high quality, go somewhere else, or whatever the hell it says)- should have been indicator that the owners or mgmt doesn't care.  Never again! Also, those margaritas... it's basically the same taste and feel (literally, mouth feel is gross) as those hysterical, horrible margs at the boozy Taco Bell that I had once- because, well you just have to try it for laughs.

2015-08-13,4.0,"El Cid is a great neighborhood Mexican restaurant that is more tailored to the hipster ambiance of Logan Square than some of the more authentic and family style Mexican restaurants in the area.  A large interior and a huge back patio allow for plenty of seating and a fun and lively atmosphere.  There's even some sort of roof deck that was empty the day we were there but I imagine can be quite fun.  Oddly, they were playing 90s grunge music when we were there, which took away from the Mexican theme a bit, but I enjoyed it more than the typical Mexican restaurant soundtrack. They were very accommodating to seat us outside and make room for our newborn and his stroller.  And the servers were very friendly and kept congratulating us on our baby.  That's always nice to hear. The menu is complete with all the usual items and some fun specials.  We weren't super hungry so we opted for a few tacos and a few quesadillas.  The quesadilla options are pretty cool in that you can order mini quesadillas (the size of a taco) and switch up fillings instead of having to order a full order.   My husband had the al pastor, skirt steak, and carnitas tacos.  I had the al pastor, chicken, and skirt steak quesadillas.  All were great.  The al pastor was probably the favorite. Their chips and salsa add a fun flair since the salsa has a bit of mole in it to give it a really unique (and addicting) flavor.  They will gladly keep refilling you on chips and salsa, but I wish they served their salsa in a bigger bowl because we were going through it like crazy.  I can see El Cid being a fun happy hour atmosphere or a great weekend afternoon party for day drinking on a nice day.  We went randomly at 4pm on a Tuesday so it was fairly empty and serene.   This is a great spot in the neighborhood for a quick bite and a beer or a full dinner and we will gladly be back again.",0.9983,0.725,0.248,0.027,0.5029047619047619

Margarita. Salmon with arroz and frijoles. Flan. Food comatose. Although the chips and salsa were complimentary, the tomatillo salsa and the pica de gallo surprised me. The tomatillo salsa had a nice bite to it and I think the pica de gallo had a bit of mole in it. If you've had a mole sauce on meat at Latin America restaurants, you've probably wanted a smoke afterwards. Love the vegetarian chimichangas, stuffed with rice, tomatoes, onions, and cheese. The fresh guacamole that came with it was a highlight. The tamale was fantastic. The red salsa that came with it had to have been made with habanero sauce. It was hot. The plate of salmon with arroz and frijoles was a true winner. Glad I ordered this instead of the usual enchiladas or tacos. And then there was the coconut flan, smooth as butter, and tasty as bliss.

The food was greasy, bland and way over priced for the lack of quality that you get. We didn't even dare to order any drinks at that point. To top it off for the bill, I wanted to break a 10 into 2 fives for the bill and a tip. They said it was not something that they do. Just another reason I guess to carry exact change. I really use to love coming here but never again. I had experienced cold food and food that had wood chips from the grill in my eggs. I thought it was just because the place was having a bad day.

C'mon, this isn't four star dining.  - The bathroom is disgusting. There was only one bathroom open for some reason. It's in severe need of renovation, a new hand dryer, a toilet that flushes and all that practical stuff. Additionally, an employee should zip in there every few hours and give it a cleaning. It was a disaster. - I honestly wish that establishments would stop with the ""we only take 2 cards per table max"" trend. It's really annoying.

Its main feature is that it's a five minute walk from my apartment. The veggie burrito is pretty damned consistently good. However, splitting a check at El Cid is a freaking nightmare. I don't mind some restrictions on check-splitting because I know it's inconvenient, but it should not be this difficult to figure out when we write everything very clearly on the receipt. Also, why all the weird restrictions on where you can and can't have various sized beverages? Some places you can't have pitchers, other places you can't have smalls. Is it that complicated? I'm pretty sure all the drinks come from the same great drink in the sky and get poured into vessels in roughly the same way. The vegetarian options aside from the burrito are mostly so-so, and it seems to be a complete tossup whether you're going to get charged for things that supposedly come with your meal, or not. The owner (?) is very friendly as are most of the servers. El Cid is at its most charming in the summer when you can chill on the back patio with a pitcher of margaritas. The drinks are pretty great. The food is just ok, with the exception of the pico de gallo which gets a solid 5 stars - they make it fresh and you can tell, it's DELICIOUS. But for the most part, you go to El Cid (2!) because it's close and convenient and pretty good, but it's not really a destination.",0.9966,0.737,0.227,0.037,0.5998915989159893

Went on a random mid Saturday afternoon and got seated immediately in the back patio. Service was quick. Love their chips and salsa so that's a plus. The waitress was nice enough.  Big negative for me: went there immediately looked at back menu which had the 1/4 chicken served with rice/beans. Tortillas the whole fixings. Got deal and was dead set on that (was a previous favorite) as I went to order the waitress informed me that they don't do the whole chicken dish or any of the sandwiches anymore on the back menu. Unaware I asked how long ago they changed that. She informed me they changed it over a year ago. Though I did not say it but my question is.... Than why is it still included on the menu? Or at least inform me prior to ordering what things are not available. Hence my 3 stars.  The tacos we ordered were good but was disappointed with that.

The first time I went we shared chips and guac and I got the steak flautas for my entree. Sooo good. The second time I went we shared chips and guac and some appetizers....again, I cannot complain about the food.  The first time the service was terrible, as our server was not attentive and I had to look around for her and even though other servers could tell that I was searching for my server, they did not stop to ask if I needed anything or to let her know I was looking, which I thought was rude. The second experience was much better and our server was very attentive.  The second time around, the manager stopped by our table to check on us and chat for a few minutes.

2013-05-24,4.0,"""I want to eat tacos today."" I believe those were the first words out of my mouth when I woke up that morning. Fortunately, my partner in crime is always game for Mexican, so we turned to Yelp for ideas. Wanting to capitalize on the nice day, we chose El Cid 2 and we chose well. El Cid has two patios, a small one in the front and a large, nice on in the back. If you can, opt for the back - there are trees to blunt the sun and it's an oasis leaving you to forget you're a stone's throw off of Kedzie. We started out with a pitcher of margaritas, probably the only low point of our dining experience at El Cid. I'm not sure what makes these margaritas famous (as claimed on the menu), but they were downright average in my book and reeked of sour mix. We struggled to get to the bottom of the pitcher because the sweetness was overwhelming; considering the pitcher did nothing to slow down our afternoon of drinking, I don't think they were all that strong either. I would try a premium next time, to see if it's any better; otherwise I'll be sticking to cerveza. When I go to most Mexican restaurants, I'm like a kid with ADD in a candy store - I want everything; fortunately, my partner in crime was able to help me maximize my food intake. Based on our server's gross understatement about the size of their burritos, we went with a veggie for me and an arrachera for him. We also ordered one potato and one fish taco to split. While we waited for our meal we snacked on the chips and salsa; I found the chunky red salsa to err on the sweet side, but quite enjoyed the heat of the salsa verde. The food was good; despite ordering more than anticipated, we both cleaned our plates. Of all of the items I ate, the fish taco was my favorite. Grilled fish, onions and cilantro - simple, but so tasty; I would come back and get these as my main meal any time. The potato taco was good too, but didn't hold a candle to Zacatacos taco de papa; the potatoes overwhelmed every other ingredient on the taco. My burrito was good, but nothing about it made it a standout, not all that unusual for the veggie burrito at most Mexican places. I would take the L'Patron veggie burrito over it easily. He, on the other hand, ate his burrito with gusto.  Overall I'd give El Cid 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding up because the patio is hard to beat. I doubt you'll leaving claiming it's the best Mexican food you've ever had, but it is solid.",0.9916,0.81,0.135,0.055,0.45027534823453197

The manager came out and said that they couldn't get me a taco but they could get me a some more of the free salsa chips. I told her that I didn't like chips and salsa and that all I'm asking is for her to replace the one taco that her staff took away no need for the rice and beans. (They did sell tacos individually). She was hesitant but was eventually convinced and told me she would replace it. However, they never did replace my taco. I wasn't going to argue too much over a tiny taco but, needless to say I did not leave a tip if they were not going to correct their errors.

2012-12-15,2.0,"On Nov. 2, 2012, I called El Cid and ordered eight items and at the end of all this I added, ""and an order of chips."" This hopefully seemed logical enough, as two of the items in my order were pico de gallo and refried beans, which are difficult to enjoy without chips. I then went to the restaurant, paid (with tip) and collected the items. The woman who rang me out was the same woman I ordered from; the receipt specifies that her name is CARMEN. When I got home, my wife and I went through the order and the chips weren't there. This was an understandable omission, so I returned to El Cid and told Carmen, ""I was in here before; I didn't get the chips,"" thinking she'd just give me a bag of chips and I'd be on my way. Instead she started haranguing me that I hadn't ordered chips before. She asked for my name and excitedly started searching around for the receipt from my order, which she was going to show me to prove to me, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that I did not order chips; that there is no way the word ""chips"" came out of my mouth when I spoke to her via phone earlier in the evening, and so, thus, chips would not be going into my mouth - at least not on her watch. It was hard to get her to even stop this to allow me to simply re-order a bag of chips and pay two dollars for them. And even then, she couldn't just get me a bag of chips and hand them to me; she had to follow the formal chip ordering procedure. This had to go through the computer and the bag of chips had to be placed in another bag with more salsa and plastic forks and spoons and napkins. I understand that she just didn't hear me when I ordered chips before; that a waitress deals with a lot of requests in the course of a night and it's hard to get them all right. I get that. But it was absolutely beyond this woman to just hand a customer a paper bag filled with chips as a make-good. I've eaten at El Cid hundreds of times in the last 11 years. The place has improved in a lot of ways in that time; in some ways remarkably. But you want to know what will never improve at El Cid? The service. It's always going to be completely unpredictable and sometimes pretty poor. You know at a lot of Mexican restaurants they will just give you chips as complementary with a to-go order.",0.8503,0.901,0.057,0.043,0.5579931972789116

Long: I'm guessing it's pretty difficult to go out to eat with me, my poor lovely wife.  My suffering friends.  I'm a foodie. I want authentic everything.  I don't want Americanized anything.  I want salsa with obscure ingredients, little old ladies with visible gold teeth making my food, serving it, or double bonus points, making and serving my food.  I like the restaurants that are filled with folks of that given nationality... Mexican, Korean, etc.  And being from the East coast, which I constantly remind people even though I moved here in the late 80's, I of course only like thin crust pizza from a select few places (3 actually in all of Chicagoland if you were wondering), none of which deliver to my house.  But I also have two kids under the age of 7.  My kids don't seem to very picky about where we eat, so long as they can either have (a) a kiddy cocktail, (b) crayons and something to color on, and/or (c) desert they are happy.  Hitherto this has limited my options.  I've done what I can to introduce edgier places but they don't like it when I bring my own crayons. Congratulations El Cid, you guys made the cut, I like your food and my kids did too.  Watching my youngest happily work his way through some cheese quesadillas and a plateful of refried beans made me almost tear up... I now have a Mexican place that the crew likes.  I liked the steak fajitas, a very safe choice, but resolve to try other items on the menu next time.  I'll try to signal my desire for the real experience, you know, something much spicier and funky, preferably served by a surly grandma who pretends not to understand English even though she's been here since the 70's. But for now, huzzah! Your upstairs is nicely appointed.  My inner foodie in me yearned for rickety tables and faded linoleum, but my outer dad in me silently applauded.  My wife liked it too.  She's not a fan of places that proudly display gas station calenders, eating while sitting next to a gray-haired grandmama darning socks. So we'll work on this, we've got something going here.  I'll be back, along with the picky brothers.  I'll ignore the 30 something hipsters who were sitting at an adjacent table wearing matching flannel.  I'll instead savor the opportunity to dine out and have Mexican food again, it's been way too long.  Perhaps we can talk about El Milagro in Pilsen and a few ideas I have for my next meal.  Can I call you?  Gracias.",0.9955,0.808,0.154,0.038,0.4312310030395137

Hell, for my college graduation I took over the upstairs with my family and friends because it's where I wanted to celebrate.  That said, I continued to go to El Cid even after they raised their prices and the quality of their food was beginning to dwindle. I'm a sucker for convenience.

Everything else?  Nothing special.  The ritas are sugary sweet and more than likely come from a bottled mix.  You'll have to work pretty hard to get hammered off of these babies.  You're probably better off ordering Coronas.

2012-04-15,3.0,"El Cid has been a good restaurant since long before the Logan Square renaissance.  I've gone to El Cid (properly ""Ed Cid 2"") since I moved to Avondale twenty years ago.  It's always been a real restaurant serving a wide array of Mexican food, not just a burrito shack.  They serve tacos and enchiladas, but also steak, snapper, chicken, pork stew, grilled shrimp, nine kinds of soup, imported Mexican soft drinks, etc. etc. - the things you expect of a sit-down restaurant catering to patrons from all over Mexico.  Their food has always been good; prices always reasonable; service always friendly.   For years El Cid was the only business on the Kedzie north of Milwaukee and south of Irving Park opened late - the only place to eat I could walk to.  All that has changed; there are two good restaurants directly north of El Cid and two more directly south.  El Cid has changed too.  There's a patio out front; a huge patio out back; and a quieter, classy-yet-relaxed dining room and lounge upstairs.  (I use a knife and fork up there; picking up a juicy burrito would be out of place.)  They serve wine now; they serve brunch now; they've got vegetarian options.  It opens early; closes late; it's child friendly (that's the way the neighborhood's going).   Expansion notwithstanding, El Cid remains good, and reasonable, and friendly.  No longer the only neighborhood option, it remains a dependable, price conscious option.  It draws good crowds; you won't be lonely.  It is the hands-down ""dining out value"" on this once derelict, now destination block.  Believe me, you will spend a lot more at any of those four other restaurants.     I like El Cid.  Go there.  My personal recommendation - a chorizo burrito with a side of cebollitas (grilled green onions).",0.9887,0.845,0.134,0.021,0.5021428571428572
2012-04-02,1.0,"From other reviews I've read, it seems this place is hit or miss. Our visit on Saturday night (3/31) was very, very miss. I went with friends who had ordered out from El Cid, but never eaten in. When we arrived, they asked our party of 4 if we'd like to sit downstairs or upstairs. We said we didn't care and they sat us upstairs at one of the high-tops near the bar, which was a mistake right off the bat. The table area wasn't nearly big enough for the 4 of us to have drinks and dinner. There was barely enough room for our basket of chips, water glasses, and margaritas. Our waitress seemed rather quiet, which I don't really appreciate in waitstaff. I like my waitstaff to be outgoing and friendly and constantly checking on us. I'd rather be interrupted with a mouthful of food than ignored all evening. I can't even excuse her for being busy because it looked like she only had about 6 tables. We ordered a pitcher of margaritas which came out in a reasonable amount of time, and which were pretty tasty. But our waitress poured them for us (did we look incapable of pouring our own drinks?) and dripped from the pitcher onto me and the table. It wasn't a huge mess, but I certainly didn't appreciate sticky jeans all night. After we finished our chips and our pitcher, they sat empty on the table for most of the meal. Our waitress got two of our orders wrong--both a friend and I ordered cheese enchiladas and got chicken. The waitress said, ""I thought you said chicken."" I could hear my friend clearly say ""cheese"" and the waitress was standing right next to her! My fault was in saying ""I'll have the exact same thing as her,"" I should have clearly stated ""Cheese enchiladas"". On the menu, it stated that enchiladas came in 2 or 3, and with a side of rice and beans. We each got one on a plate, no sides. Clearly, someone screwed up. My friend and I both ordered a veggie burrito instead, which was much better. I have to say the food was pretty decent for a Mexican place. I'd give it another try for takeout, but I'd never eat in their dining room again. The service was terrible.",0.9751,0.752,0.146,0.103,0.49697751322751327
2012-03-30,5.0,"This place has everything a great restaurant should have: really good food and drinks, genuine and attentive service, and a rad painting in the bathroom. WHO DOESN'T APPRECIATE A NICE BATHROOM? The chips came out warm and the salsas were fresh, and different from most taqueria salsas. The pico was a little sweet, the green was the right balance of spicy, tangy, and salty. Maybe they have a unique recipe instead of shit from bottles? The Margaritas were nice and boozy and just sweet enough. I had the chicken Enchilada dinner plate and it was bomb. The Mole sauce was flavorful, chocolaty, silky and smoky, just like my mom makes. So many Mexican places miss the mark with Mole! The rice was a rare treat too: fluffy and aromatic, with green beans, peas, carrots, and corn. FLAVOR PARTY! My boyfriend (who ordered fish and al pastor tacos) sez: Sometimes when tacos have doubled-up corn tortillas it can be too much tortilla, even as they sog up and fall apart on you anyway. These tacos had just one robust tortilla, which was delicately fried and didn't fall apart despite holding up an abundance of meat. Our server was my favorite kind of server: casual, naturally warm and sincere, attentive, with a sense of humor. Sometimes a well-placed joke or two lets you know that the server is paying attention to your needs and to the vibe at the table, and that they understand good service contributes to a good dining vibe. Well played! You know it's a winner when the dinner conversation turns to descriptions of what you're each eating, followed by family-style plate sharing. We felt like we were on Check Please!, like on one of the good episodes. And there's a mural of the best Loteria card in the deck (EL DIABLITO)! Points.

2012-03-22,4.0,"I came here at midnight with 3 friends last night since we wanted a little snack and this is my friend's favorite Logan square Mexican place.  The downstairs section was completely empty and we were invited to sit anywhere upstairs or outside. We chose upstairs since we were concerned it might get a little cold outside.  Our waitress described herself as ""fried"" after a long day, which we could understand since it was st Patrick's day, and we appreciated that she was upfront with us. We ordered drinks (sangria and mango margaritas), and they took longer to arrive than we would have liked, but she stopped by to let us know the delay was because they had run out of sangria and were getting more. We all liked the drinks, and since we'd gotten the smaller size (still decently sized), they were only $4.75 each.  We also order some snacks - I got one mini steak enchilada with mole sauce (only $2 and super delicious!) and one chicken taco (only $1.95). Both were kind of small as you'd expect for the price and if I were there again, I'd skip the tacos and go with enchiladas instead since they were covered in cheesy goodness and the taco just wasn't as exciting, although the chicken was juicy and flavorful.  After we all told the waitress our orders, she repeated it back to us to make sure she'd gotten it right (we wondered why she didn't just write it down). When the food arrived, the order was correct except my one friend received a steal instead of chicken taco. When she told the waitress, she immediately took it back and brought the correct taco out soon.  There were, of course, free chips and salsa. They brought out two kinds of salsa, pico de gallo and some green sauce. I only ate the pico de gallo since I'm not into spicy things, and even that was a little spicy for me, but everyone else seemed to like the salsas, especially the green one.  My other friend got a tostada and it was pretty much the same size as the tacos but on a hard shell rather than soft tortilla and it also had refried beans, cheese, lettuce, and tomato while the tacos only had meat, onions, and cilantro. The tostada cost $3.50 or $3.75 or something like that.  Overall it was good food for a good price. And it was a nice environment to sit in an easy for us to talk since it wasn't super crowded. The full dinners cost what you'd expect ($8-12 on average) but its seems like an even better place for a late night snack/drink. I'd go back here for sangria or a margarita and enchiladas if I were in the area.",0.9963,0.82,0.149,0.032,0.5790378724589251

2012-02-21,3.0,"I've passed by El Cid 2 a few times on my way back & forth so one night I got a craving for some Mexican food and beer so I decided to stop in and give the place a shot. It was a Tuesday night; the place was fairly empty there were 3 college students sitting at the bar and another guy at a table.  The waitress was pretty quick to take my order and I just waited for it to come up. The Kitchen at El Cid 2 is pretty much right in back of the bar area so you can see all the food being handled and cooked.  I ordered Tacos that night and saw the food being cooked to order which was pretty nice.  The food didn't blow my taste buds away but hey they are Tacos and I felt I got a decent amount of food for the money. However I can't in good conscience give this place more than 3 stars due to the other food that was prepared in front of me.  There were a number of Main Dishes and Sides that were simply tossed into a Microwave and warmed up then handed off to customers to eat. I understand that this is pretty common place in the restaurant industry but most of these types of things happen in a backroom away from customers prying eyes.  And while the practice of making food ahead for customers and keeping things refrigerated then heating them up works great for something that takes hours and hours of prep-work, it's just laziness to grab a frozen/refrigerated burrito and toss it in the microwave.   If I had ordered anything more complex than Taco's I know I would've recieved a pre-made reheated something or other and I would've walked out feeling somewhat ripped off.",0.9443,0.896,0.083,0.021,0.5147142857142858

Their first floor is your average mexican restaurant and when the weather is warm they have a front and back patio. But if you'd like to take it up a notch you should try their second floor.

The food, for me it was just ok. Maybe having a Mexican husband and living in a Mexican household had spoiled my taste buds for Mexican food? But the flavor of the food was really blend.

They have a cute patio area so going on a nice day is recommended. The only thing that sucks about the patio is that they don't serve 'ritas by the pitcher, which is beyond me.

The papa rellenos are definitely made with instant mash potatoes, and not very good ones. Sauce on the side was absolutely french dressing with a kick of spice in it. Empanada filling was sparse and tasteless. Margaritas were 90% sour mix. Not sure if there was any alcohol in them at all. I could go on but you get the point.

The ""candy-ritas"", as one co worker referred to them, were like koolaid...and overload of sweet and sour mix and not even the slightest hint of a tequila taste. Were these made with wine? Tell me it was just a bad batch! We ordered two pitchers...they sucked so bad! A few people switched to beer , which one complained that the beer was totally flat....we ordered a mojito in which the bartender claimed they were out of....OUT OF?! Is this pre made Mojito mix? Disgusting....because are you really out of Rum, simple syrup, lime , soda water and mint? It looks like you have the majority if not all of the ingredients right there in front of me....I guess she only knew how to pour mixes. Later she said they all of a sudden have more mojito and served this brownish olive green drink to us....that tasted indescribable and not in a good way. That is just the drinks.Now for the food. Three of us got different burritos. They were so unsatisfying...not filling wise....I mean..a huge flour tortilla is going to fill anyone up. The burrito lacked any fresh or tasty ingredient. The chips and salsa..... Tell me, someone...do they make their Pico with Ketchup? We all agreed that it had to be ketchup in it....though both the pico and what i'm assuming was the tomatillo salsa were both unnaturally sweet with an aftertaste of something really terrible.

Rocks.  Lime.  With salt.   The chips are good.  They're chips that aspire to be tasty vehicles for bringing salsa or guacamole to your mouth.  They achieve this aspiration nicely.  Speaking of which, both the verde and the roja options are excellent.  The guacamole is tastye, but the portion is small (OK, so I miss CA guacamole portions ... I admit it). The food is yummy, and there are plenty of vegetarian options that don't suck.  The beans are good (this from my Chicana partner, who cares deeply about such things).  The shrimp ceviche is a crisp, limed up bit o' lovely.  This is food you enjoy eating for reasonable prices, and you go there because you are interested in actually hearing your dining companion's conversation (if you're in the main floor dining area), or to go on a date not over-populated with self-absorbed pretenteratti (if you go upstairs), or to sit outside surrounded by people from the neighborhood genuinely enjoying themselves (if you go to the back patio).  Heck, if you really *must* be seen, you can sit out front. Honestly, aside from the solid good food and good drinks, I think the thing I like the best about this place is that the doucheoise (tip o' the keyboard to Andrew C for that amazing term) often don't like it.  Because El Cid is not about them, praise the deity of your choice, and it doesn't cater to those expectations.  It's a good, solid neighborhood option with gems of it's own (like that on the back patio you are not allowed to order a small margarita -- only medium or large).  It's not the L & E  and it's not trying to be, and that is a good thing.",0.9982,0.763,0.207,0.029,0.5364448051948053

And those extra salty delicious fresh off the burner tortilla chips... you just had to ask for a refill, didn't you?

What I'm really saying is that I would only recommend eating that amount of salt if it's the night of Halloween and you're planning on going as a water bed. You won't even need a costume. People will just assume you're a waterbed or a double humped camel. You might even win a costume contest out of pure intimidation.

From what I recall, the drinks were never anything spectacular and the menu really wasn't very appealing. The first time I went with my friends, we sat on the back patio, which was a bit small but very bright and festive. I ordered a bowl of chicken soup which was, much to my dismay, filled to the top with chicken chunks and bone. I don't know if that's normal...but the sharp bones and entire severed chicken wing was painful and nauseating to consume. Along with the soup, the air that night was filled with the heavenly scent of rotted garbage. The fence that surrounded the back patio apparently stood back to back with the restaurant's garbage cans and every time the breeze kicked in, the diners were assaulted with wave after wave of putrid back-alley trash. I made the huge mistake of going there on Cinco de Mayo once. I believe we had a group of five people...which after the three hour wait boiled down to three. Finally being seated on the back patio, two very hungry girls and an extremely agitated guy waited quite some time for our waitress. After ordering, we waited an hour and a half for our food, noticing how many tables around us had already been served when they had arrived after us. At one point, our waitress hurried past, saw the three of us, gained a wild-eyed look of shock, and sprinted into the kitchens. Our food was quite cold when we finally got it. At the end of Cinco de Mayo, we sat on the back patio quite unhappily, our night ending with a huge fight between my two friends and absolutely no comment from the staff about the hours of waiting or the fact that the waitress had forgotten our food.

We were starving and in a hurry, and you can see this place from the bus/train plaza so we decided to give it a shot. The back patio was really cute, and the food smelled great - we were already getting excited while waiting for the hostess to find us a table.  The tables were so close to each other that we could hardly even sit in our chairs without elbowing the people at the tables next to us. (As it turns out, the food at this place is so bad that it wouldn't kill them to remove a table and make some breathing room).  We ordered a pitcher of margarita. We were brought chips - and just in time since I was about to starve to death! But the salsa really wasn't very good - quite bland - and after we scarfed down one plate of chips they took away the salsa (I like using it on my entree :( - and I could have eaten another plate of them). At this point, it just felt stingy.  I ordered the enchiladas with mole sauce. AWFUL. The mole was sweet and bland and there wasn't much of it. The corn tortillas were dry and the chicken inside was barely seasoned. The mexican rice was worse - it looked like they threw a bag of frozen veggies in the rice and then let it sit all day (the edges of the lima beans (wtf?) were crusty and dry). My husband had a burrito which wasn't half bad. The 2 stars go for his food as I would give it a 0.  The service was slow and the people around us that sat after us received their food before us. It took a long time to get our order taken and for the food to show up. The wait staff kept trying to clear our food plates before we were done eating.

2009-07-01,4.0,"El Cid may be getting 4 stars due to nostalgia, as my sister took me here once years ago when she lived in Chicago - but in all honesty judging by my and Theron's trip there last night, it deserves it.  The atmosphere is fun, colorful, and I was particularly pleased to encounter a mariachi band as we rounded the corner to the upstairs dining area. We sat a cross from the bar in a cozy, warmly lit nook at high tables and, while it did take *forever* for our food to come out, our orders were carried out to a T.  We both got the combination plate -  I with a chicken enchilada with verde sauce, a 'tostada' without meat, and a chicken soft taco.  The tostada should have been served on a separate plate and even come out sooner, as the shell was no longer crispy upon arrival.  The rice was a bit sweet for me but the beans were decent, the chicken meat was good - what you would expect of a typical Mexican place - and the enchilada was delightful, covered with white cheese. Theron enjoyed his 'quesadilla' but in my opinion doubling a corn tortilla and folding them over a bunch of white cheese is not a quesadilla. But, he liked it so who am I to judge? ;) We also ordered a fish taco - as everyone raved about them. I thought the flavor was really good (my friend liked it a lot) and loved the use of cilantro, but could only eat a couple bites because it was way too salty for me.   Let me also state that after initial wariness, the margarita I ordered (Herradura, cointreau, and fresh lime juice) was made exceptionally well. It was pleasant to drink but had an underlying strength to it that made waiting on our food to arrive much more fun. :)  The waitress also brought out gardinaire mix of pickled and oily jalapenos, carrots, and onions you get in some taquerias for me, since I love spicy food.

The restaurant is a very nice and cozy with color everywhere.  I love the orange of the walls and the other color accents everywhere.  Sometimes a lot of color can be disastrous (i.e. too crazy) but El Cid managed to appeal to my eyes.   Our server was great!  I think his name was Josh (we're horrible people for not listening closely!) and he was super funny and awesome.  He gets five stars for being funny and excellent.  He greeted us warmly in many languages and he was really laid back and fun.  My boyfriend's mom spilled a glass of water on the table right after he gave it to her and we started chiding her for being clumsy - he chimed right in!  It was really hysterical that he was playing along and being funny and friendly.  I really liked the service.  He was attentive and knew exactly when to come to the table when he realized we needed something.   Food was good.  I had a burrito suizo and, honestly, I thought the ""suizo"" part was going to be fake cheese but instead it was real, melted chihuahua cheese.  Is that a bad thing?  Not at all.  I love chihuahua cheese.  However, I guess I had just been looking forward to fake nacho cheese smothered all over the top and then it was kind of a let down.  Don't ask me why I like gross fake cheese more than real good cheese... I just do.  And the Burrito Bravo at UIC makes the burrito suizo that way.  And it was just a burrito - nothing exceptional.  It's pretty hard to make a burrito poorly, so it tasted like any burrito that I've ever had at a taqueria.  My family was super impressed with the food.  They really enjoyed everything they had.  My boyfriend's step-dad really loved his burrito suizo and my boyfriend and his mom had the flautas, which they said were excellent.   The salsa was the best part of the evening next to the service.  Seriously, I have NO idea what it was about that damn salsa, but it was so excellent.  I mean EXCELLENT.  The salsa doesn't just get five stars - it gets at least seven.  It is so amazing.  I cannot tell what it was about it that gave it a very particular, sweet taste but it was so good.  It was as if the right amount of each ingredient was present - it didn't taste too acid-y like tomatoes or too pungent like onions.  It was literally perfect with just a touch of sweetness.  Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm it was so good.  Our server even hooked us up with a pint of it to take home for FREE.  Amazing.  I'll be back for the salsa, just you wait.",0.9994,0.632,0.285,0.084,0.6631483199340339
2008-11-16,3.0,"I have been frequenting El Cid in Logan Square for some time... mostly because it's near my house and it's hard to find good fish tacos in Chicago (not fried). The food is average here, but the service has always been good and the patio is really nice when we are fortunate enough to have nice weather in Chicago.  The patio has always been a great place to hang out with friends.  Since the upstairs has been added to this place... my friends and I have really had real problems with the management at El Cid. The upstairs is nice, and when we first saw it, we were excited that our casual little ""let's grab some tacos and talk"" place seemed to be turning into a cooler place. Unfortunately, there are some major machismo issues going on with the management - and a ridiculous ""No Pitchers Upstairs"" rule. To make a few long stories short - there seems to be at least one particular male manager will argue with you endlessly (at least if you are female) until you are so insulted you walk out and leave. Once, a group of 14 of us left after complaining about the ""no pitchers upstairs"" rule. The manager scoffed at our questioning of the rule and offered us no solution/alternative. In my opinion, if, as a manager, you have an attractive and successful group of young women who come in to spend a lot of money at your establishment (also, most of us frequent the joint), you do what you can to solve the problem - and you don't talk down to the customer. We walked out after we realized we were talking to a macho-man. We decided to get pitchers of margaritas and food down the street and we all got to talking about how many of us have had bad experiences at El Cid ever since the upstairs opened. Seems that this has been a problem with a lot of people.  WATCH OUT for the rule ""No Pitchers Upstairs.""  It is really unreasonable.  They are trying to act like the upstairs is a different restaurant than the downstairs - it's not. It's the same exact food and drinks. They just want groups to spend more money on individual drinks, when upstairs. They say it is an issue of carrying the pitchers up and down the stairs - they have nowhere to keep the pitchers at the upstairs bar. The bar upstairs is BIG and they carry ALL of the food up and down the stairs, as well as the dishes, so there shouldn't really be an issue. They also say that they only have premium taquila upstairs... ok... so, charge more for BETTER pitchers of margaritas. Yeah right. The management is very stubborn and will not bend.   I'm disappointed that El Cid management/ownership doesn't feel that their customers deserve to be treated with more respect. They obviously assumed their customers wouldn't realize that they were being ripped off by their ""no pitchers upstairs"" rule. My friends and I miss our little sweet dive, with the patio. Even though the food isn't amazing, we felt like management was pretty down-to-earth and everyone there cared about pleasing the customer. Now, it feels like some guy just wants to make his upstairs the ""cool place"" and rip off people who don't have enough sense to walk out and complain about the unreasonable rule.  My friends and I are tempted to go to the patio when it's nice out, because it's easy and close, but then we remind ourselves of the macho-man who talked down to us for ten minutes and we quickly regain our senses.",0.9959,0.747,0.164,0.089,0.5070975056689343

I've noticed a raise in prices corresponding to the gentrifying Logan Square. I'm sure the upstairs addition is a sign of their success and attempt to catch some of those hipster dollars. But the somewhat lush lounge lacks the quaint feel, prompt service, and reasonable prices I love about El Cid2.

I make an executive decision to order two more LARGE margaritas next time I see her.  The chips and salsa were good. I started munching on them while resting my voice. More conversation (screaming) follows. Half of the people at the table did not get my name. I had to write it down on a piece of paper and pass it around. And these are my own people (aka, Indians). My name is not unfamiliar among my own people.  The food... I have had better Mexican food. I ordered the enchiladas suizas with chicken and verde sauce. You know it is bad when you have to request hot sauce to make it taste better. Yes, it was that bad. Or, I should say BLAND (oops, I am screaming again). The chicken tasted like it was boiled in salt water. There was no flavor to the entire dish. And, what's up with that salad? Wilted lettuce that looks like it is going to go bad tomorrow does not make a salad. The rice and beans completed the circle of blandness.  I am already on my third LARGE margarita by the end of dinner. Still no buzz. I am not a heavy drinker. I am usually knocked down after 1.5 margaritas at Tecalitlan. More screaming ensues and everyone finishes dinner. Overall, it was not horrible... but, below mediocre. Not worth going all the way to Logan Square. I feel sorry for the people eating there... you all should try Tecalitlan.  I'll stick to Tecalitlan for the food and margaritas. As I heard from my Mexican friends, Tecalitlan has the best Mexican food in Chicago (outside their motherland). And the margaritas are awesome.  I paid $45 for a below average dinner and weak drinks. NOT COOL. The only reason I stayed there is because I was meeting a group and didn't want to come off as a bitch (well, I am not sure if I accomplished that goal).  I love you Tecalitlan. I am sorry for cheating on you. Never again. P.S. Apologies for all the screaming in the review. I am still in ""screaming mode"".",-0.4984,0.821,0.091,0.088,0.5234607753357753

I was expecting a large slop of pico de gallo and refried beans, which would've been just dandy, but the black bean salad was a cute touch. The chicken kabob was in an odd BBQ like sauce, but it tasted fine. Shrimp were large and lovely...much enjoyed.  Corona Light, mmmmm. A summer evening in Logan Square....quite splendid.

Aside from the great food, the atmopshere is nice, especially in the outdoor section.  It is totally enclosed and gives it almost a European feel.  There was a guitarist playing classical flamenco guitar and singing songs in Spanish, which was not disruptive to conversation at all.

2006-09-16,5.0,"AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!  That's how I describe my first visit to El Cid II.  Just a great traditional Mexican restaurant.  It's everything I look for in a good Mexican place: diverse menu that includes many of the old stand-bys and great prices.   I started dinner with a mojito.  It was very well balanced, not a rum avalanche, like so many can be.  Nor did it have an overkill of mint leaves to clog the straw. HANG ON!  CALIFORNIA LOVE JUST CAME ON MY IPOD.  I HAVE TO GO BREAK DANCE WITH MY CATS! OK, I'm back.  So my dinner...Fish tacos.  Many time's I've ordered the Fish tacos in our fair city and gotten a Fillet-o-Fish taco.  But this offering was grilled talapia.  Expertly prepared and so tender and moist.  Fresh onion and cilantro were added, as well as cheese.  They were wrapped in the best flour tortilla I've had outside of New Mexico.  BETTER THAN UNCLE JULIO'S!   But the gold stamp of approval came from my Mexican wife when she gave her blessing to the rice and beans.  As she will tell me, they are the standard by which you measure a place.  If they suck, it doesn't matter how good the main course is.  Luckily, she approved the arroz y frijoles and we can return to El Cid II.  This is good news, because my folks visit us next week and they love Mexican food.",0.9971,0.709,0.27,0.022,0.45316804407713507

Nothing particularly SPECTACULAR about the place, but that's not the idea.  It's a stumble off the Logan Square Blue Line with smiley service and reasonable prices.   My only criticism would have to be the Mojito's which tasted ""neh"", and somewhat resembled ecto-cooler.  I usually prefer mine where you can SEE the fresh crushed mint leaves in the drink, rather than just assume there's mint because the drink is hyper-color green.  If you're looking for real-deal Mojito's go to El Nandu, or Coobah's or the tons of other places that I don't know of and am not currently reviewing.
