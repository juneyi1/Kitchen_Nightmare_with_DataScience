We had not experienced good Filipino cuisine since we moved from southern California. Everything we had at Ruby's met or exceeded expectations, including the lechon kawali, kare kare, shrimp dish, and desserts. Another indicator of the excellence of the food in this small restaurant is that they were busy preparing dishes for a couple of weddings. The icing on the cake was the friendly service.

2017-07-21,4.0,"I love their Tapsilog, the best one I've had so far here in the US. The tapa is cooked just right, it's really savory, they serve it with runny egg, and a hefty amount of fried rice. Just one taste transports me back to the Philippines. I also love their palabok, I could probably finish a whole tray all by myself because it's really good. What I also enjoy in Ruby's is their all you can eat deal, affordable and yummy. I'd give it 5 stars but sometimes the wait takes forever (even when we've ordered the food in advance over the phone-- ie. palabok was ordered days earlier, scheduled a time for pick up and all, but upon arrival we still waited for about 20mins or so).

I didn't catch the guy's name at the counter but I'm assuming he was one of the owners. He hooked us up with free Lumpia that if I bought that in Seattle would have cost at least $15.  Saved us money on cost of buffet as well.   Definitely wasn't expecting that which makes his show of hospitality even greater.   Highly recommend Ruby's for their great customer service and great food.",0.9897,0.711,0.289,0.0,0.6365432098765431

I've got to be honest, you have to be a little bold to go in here the first time. It's tight & the regulars know what's going on & you'll feel like you're in the way as you stand in line in the center of the little restaurant, which also serves as a buffet so people are constantly moving about its tight quarters.  If you're not familiar with Filipino, the food is different and will take some explanation. Luckily the folks behind the counter are the nicest people you'll ever meet & they'll walk you through ever dish and offer you samples (most food is already made on the buffet line).  It's a really great cultural experience & really great food.

2017-04-25,3.0,"Dropped by Ruby's on a Saturday for lunch and was super excited to try out the buffet! It was prime time and wow - the joint was crowded with Filipino families! Nevertheless, we were immediately pleased by the stamp of authenticity this crowd gave to Ruby's. Beware that the whole place might be crowded, with nowhere to walk, and no signs on what to do to get your order. So here are my instructions: 1) When you walk in, expect a long line - but note that the line is for take-out only. Wait in this line if you're getting take-out. Otherwise, go straight to the mini-buffet in the front and grab a styrofoam plate and utensils. 2) Help yourself to the food from the hot bar. For dishes with sauce, use a styrofoam bowl. There's no labels on the food, but it's probably safe to assume it's either fish, pork, or beef.. I wasn't too impressed with the food. I've had better pancit, and the meat dishes lacked flavor and all ended up tasting the same. 3) If you want the spaghetti, ask the guy in the back to scoop you a plate. It's delicious and one of my fav things here! 4) Eat and enjoy the food, though you won't know what anything is called 5) Grab a cup of water from water cooler because now that you've finally eaten, you can start taking care of your other bodily functions 6) Go up for seconds 7) Get dessert: which is either a fried banana lumpia or coconut soup with large mochi-like things (I'm completely butchering what it is.. sorry) 8) Pay at the register. It's about $9! Good deal IMO It was an interesting experience overall but a lot of my favorite filipino dishes weren't there :( so I won't be back for the buffet.

My go to is the tapsilog, cheap and always fills me up. They also have buffet style on weekends. A selection of around 12 dishes WITH DESSERT for $10; ya can't beat it.  The service never had a bad experience. They're always on time and the owner is starting to remember my name. Either he has good memory, or I'm there too often .......

Whenever I come in, there are always multiple Filipino families having their family lunches here and a long line for take out, which is a great sign. The buffet is roughly $8 something (cash only) and they have a different menu for Saturday and Sunday. I highly recommend getting the dinuguan and the lechon on Saturdays because if you're like me, and you love pork fat and pork skin, then you get to grab as much as you want without any guilt.

2017-03-25,5.0,"NOTE: Cash only. Small space. Order first then sit. Ruby's Fast Food was my first stop on my Chicago food tour 2017. I tried to order a little bit of everything, and boyyy, did I make the right decision! Coming from a town with a lively Filo community, but a lack of Filo restaurants, it felt like home when I visited Ruby's. The service was impressive. The man behind the scenes took orders, rang everyone up, and packaged the food continuously as people kept falling into line.  As a Filo myself, I have high expectations of Filo food; basically, it should be as good as my mom's cooking. Ruby's Fast Food delivers the best Filipino food outside of your nanay's kitchen! Everything was traditionally flavorful and pretty perfect. I almost teared up with every bite. It is worth noting that with the very affordable prices Ruby's offers, their portions are so generous! Ruby's embodies what Filo restaurants should be as far as taste and service go. It's disappointing that there aren't more places like this to show the world how fantastic Filo food can be. But, I'm happy Ruby's exists and is doing well- as it rightfully should be! I highly recommend visiting Ruby's Fast Food if you're in the area. If not, make a point to stop by sooner or later! It will not disappoint! Highlights: -Tapsilog ($4.75): The tapa was perfectly marinated and cooked. The egg was sublimely complimentary. The rice was a little bit of heaven with every bite. -Cantaloupe juice: Not on the menu or not that I saw. I saw some customers drinking, and I had to ask for it. So light and refreshing! -Bihon pancit ($5.75): This was an ENTIRE takeout box. The portion was incredibly large! -Two entrees + rice combo (forgot the price): Kare kare and nilaga were on point. Kare kare is my favorite, and I always love eating it with oxtail. Ruby's has theirs with pork belly, and that was just as good. The nilaga was good too; I wish there were more meat on it, though.",0.9982,0.735,0.233,0.032,0.5959988385598142
2017-03-18,5.0,"Grew up near this little gem, started out ordering the breakfasts topsilog, longsilog, etc which you should order ahead of time. They are huge portions and if you prefer smaller portions, can definitely share with another person. Comes with a good portion of whatever meat you chose with garlic fried rice, 2 fried eggs, and a side of vinegar to sip your meat. Yum! Great deal for under $6. I also get the 2 ulam and rice deal (2 entrees and rice) which is also under $6. The entree selections vary every day which is great so you can also order something different. This really saved me a lot of money and time when my dad went to the Philippines for 4 weeks and I took care of my mom while he was gone (and worked still). I couldn't afford to keep ordering out everyday and I could tell mom was sick of my cooking (I cannot cook Filipino food) so I would stop by Ruby's and order the 2 ulam and rice - mom loved everything I brought home.  They also have slices of Filipino desserts like casava cake, maja blanco, etc - which are very tasty and a good deal. I haven't done their buffet on the weekends but I'm sure it's good because the place is always packed during lunchtime.  A few tips for newcomers: cash only and you always have to wait in line, even if you call your order ahead of time and just have to pay. You fall in line with everyone else, only one person serving, ringing out, and answering phone orders. I don't know how he does it and manages to be a very calm and very nice.

I think it's too sweet but I don't normally like shaved ice. The worst part is that there are too many people and the service is really really slow.

I always like to see when locals eat somewhere, since that's a sure sign that they are preparing authentic food, at a good price, and good quality.  Despite the menu being exclusively in Filipino, the guy serving was more than happy to break it down for us, and not make us feel silly for asking questions.  We over ordered, since we don't know when we'll net be able to visit again, but we ate as much as we possibly could, and honestly didn't have a thing we didn't enjoy.  The lumpia were amazing, the buffet had some incredible dishes, including the best pork belly I ate in Chicago during my visit. The blood soup with pork and tripe might not be for the faint hearted, but the flavor is amazing - and I went back for more of that.  I'd go back for sure next time we visit, and that's saying a lot since we would be in a food-city, with limited numbers of meals we could fit in... So we'd typically always want to eat somewhere new each time, but this was good enough to warrant going back again for sure.  Pro tip - sit behind the door, it doesn't close properly, and people don't close it behind them, so it gets super cold - we were right there, so we'd keep closing it each time someone came/went.

Most places would not be willing to fill such a large order on such short notice. However, at Ruby's, not only were we told that it would be no problem at all, but they didn't even charge extra for the last minute order.  I would HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend trying it out.

Ruby's son (I forgot to ask his name), took the time to explain the canteen style food for me. He even volunteered to let me sample every menu item. We are talking about 1 inch cuts of meat here of salmon, pork, and beef, all in different sauces.  I was almost full from trying all the samples!   I'm bad with names but I got the pork cooked in shrimp paste, salmon with onions, and fried beef w garlic fried rice and two eggs. He knew I was a first timer, so threw in a container of spagetti and leftover beef sauce to eat with rice. Try the purple desert made of purple yam called ube. Homemade and delicious!! I've been in a rut lately with food, not really craving or enjoying anything, just going through the motions for sustenance. I think it was because the food is different from what I'm use to eating that I really enjoyed the food. Very refreshing to enjoy food this way again. This place is really great. I grew up in albany park and amazed that today is the first time I've heard of this place (the restaurant has been open for 19 years). I will definitely go back to try their weekend buffet, lumpia, and lechon. This place also caters, so I'll be getting a tray of lumpias from here, rather than my usual place.  The prices are very reasonable! I had a ton of food with all the freebies that feed 3 people with plenty of leftovers. Total was $16 and change.

There's a board on the wall that I ordered the Topsilog ( I suppose the rice box) and then there's the pre-cooked trays of food. I got in half an hour before closed and I thought, shoot, they ran out of food, but they cook the topsilog in the kitchen. I got half beef and half pork - the pork is way better, beef is cut thick and tough. Both are meat candy that can be offset with the vinegar onion sauce. The rice is fantastic and TWO eggs that looks partially poached and fried. It's two meals in ONE. I'm ok with the lumpia.

The garlic rice is delicious, and the tapsilog was definitely our favorite item. The tocilog was not my favorite- it was kinda dry and tough, but I guess I'm just not that into fried meat. Lumpia shanghai were good also. The dessert looked awesome but it was VERY much corn flavored, and I'm sure it's an acquired taste, but it's not my taste yet :) In the meantime, everything was at least good, and the tapsilog was great.

Not even a question.  Ruby's was my favorite restaurant in Chicago - over hot doug's, way too much chicago pizza, and others What to expect?  A small space with a community atmosphere and some amazing food (I've never had Filipino before so I can't speak on authenticity)  -- Food - 3 / 3  We got the Sunday Lunch buffet.  $8.45 for some of the most amazing food I've ever had.  So good, that I forgot to take pictures, sorry guys!  (Some) of the Food I loved:  -Seafood with mussels stew - really good and something you wouldn't expect from such a cheaply priced buffet  -Crispy pork (similar to the pata) - I was really bummed I didn't have time to order the crispy pata (you have to call a few days ahead), but this was a very good substitute -Fried chicken - Perhaps the best fried Chicken I ever had -think the adobo spices just worked -Desserts - Ernie and Arnie just threw this in for us for free because we were from out of town.  There was one cinnamon soup + dumpling dish that was like nothing I've ever had (a good thing) One negative: The tapsilog ($5.75) - maybe it's because I never had it before, but the meat was too dry for me.  -- Value - 1/1  Umm $8.45 for all-you-can-eat, filipino food that I can get nowhere else.  Enough said -- Atmosphere - 1/1  Ernie and Arnie were so nice and really contributed to the family /community atmosphere -- The other stuff:  This is the reason I wanted to start Yelping!

They usually have some hot trays of chicken, pork and tripe adobo rocking at the front and if you are in a hurry to get some food in you this stuff is ready to go. If you are in the mood for some tocino or longaniza you can order off the menu and this stuff is well worth the 5 minute wait to get it out to you. They also have all the other traditional filipino food on the menu so the selection is everything you'd really want.  The only downside of this place is that the inside is very very sparse. It has a few rows of tables along either wall and the inside is very compact. You could probably only fit about 25 people in here total at one time. That being said the food is still awesome.

That is why it's very difficult to find a seat to enjoy the $8.45 all you want weekends only buffet (try early when they won't be running out of food yet or early-late like 2:30, but that's not even a safe bet for seating at the communal tables.) From 3-5 you can find a seat, but they might be out of the beef and tripe stew with peanut sauce and that would be a shame, or running short of my very favorite: the fatty pork spareribs balanced perfectly with sour tamarind broth, green beans and potatoes. They won't be out of crispy pork belly, though, and you can always comfort yourself with that thought. Crispy chiccharon-like skin; tender fatty meat, served with a vinegar based sauce or a weirdly generically named ""all purpose sauce,"" that really gets the job done. If you want to simply choose ""ulams"" or single dishes from the buffet -- and the two I named are solid winners but so is everything else I've tried here -- with rice to go, that will set you back just 5.45 to try two. The counter service here is amazing considering how completely insane the line, the takeout, the constant phonecall orders and the one guy working the register and counter. Everyone knows Ricky's name -- he's one of the owner's two sons and he has a zen like calm you would need in such an environment.

2014-04-14,5.0,"I'm still dreaming about the tocilog I had last weekend at Ruby's Fast Food. It was a huge portion and I had to stop myself from eating the entire meal so I wouldn't bust at the seams. Upon arrival at this hole in the wall Filipino food spot, we were met with a super long line. We waited in line about 30 minutes before making it up to the counter to finally order. You place your order with a super nice guy, pay the man your money [Pro-Tip: Ca$h only], then wait for your goods. It then took another 15 minutes for our food to be ready. It's well worth the wait but I highly recommend going in non-peak times (ie opening & closing) to avoid the insane waits.  Once we got our food, we decided to take it to go as there were no seats in the small restaurant. I tried the: Tocilog $5.75 - This meal was mine, mine, mine! And I'm so glad. Absolutely my favorite thing I had. Came with a huge heaping portion of garlic rice, two eggs and a good portion of tocino (sweetened cured pork). Usually this dish is served with sunnyside up eggs but at Ruby's they do fried eggs. I'm down with it. Seriously so good, I could eat this meal everyday.  Tapsilog $5.75 - Same as above except substitute the tocino with tapa (dried meat). Honestly I preferred the tocino but still a very solid meal. My friend liked his tapsilog better than my tocilog so to each their own! Lumpia $4.45 for 12 pieces - Every Asian culture seems to have their own take on what we think of as an eggroll and lumpia is just that for Filipinos. At Ruby's they serve Lumpia Shanghai which are thin, long rolls filled with meat, some random veggies & spices, deep fried to make one strip of goodness. They come with sauce for dipping. Yum! Prices are insanely reasonable and considering how big the portions are, super cheap! Amazing value and even better food. I hate to do comparisons but Ruby's is WAY better than Uncle Mike's.

Place wasn't even open when we got there. At first, I thought the place was closed. I parked and walked up to the entrance. Place is scheduled to open @ 11:30a...  According to the hand-written sign. So, we waited in our mini-van since we already had an excellent parking spot. As soon as the door opened at 11:00a, people from out of nowhere started to appear and entered the restaurant. We hurried to get in there as well because we planned to dine in. I've visited before, with my wife.  During winter, I believe. My wife was turned off because there was no proper ventilation to vent out the smell of cooked food.  The smell of cooked food, as many Filipinos know, latches on to you and you take it everywhere you go. You'll need another shower if you're going somewhere else after Ruby's. This time around, summer, there's no change.  If you visit, you'll smell liked cooked food when you get out of there. Many who were there bought food To-Go.  Many dined in. There were many people who lined up for food! Place is small.  Be prepared to wait if you feel like dining in.  Or, get there early. Some even called-in their order so their food's ready when they arrive. We ordered, 1 - Tapsilog, 1 - Tosilog, 1 - Longsilog, 2 - Bangsilog, 1 - Sotanghon, 1 - Lechon Kawali, Ube and Cassava for dessert.

She's 77 and Filipina.  She knows when it's good/very good or not. The Bangus (Fried Milkfish) is too vinegary for my taste.  My Mom prefers Uncle Mike's small Bangus (Fried and crispy) instead. The Tapa, Tocino, and Longanisa is good.  Garlic Fried Rice (Sinangag) is very good. The way the eggs were fried, I like as well.  It definitely reminded me of how eggs were fried in the Philippines (Eggs were fried in kawali.  Eggs aren't fried in non-stick pans.) The meal we had lasted us 'til dinner time.  We're definitely full (busog) and it's how it should be when you eat Filipino food. The desserts?  It's one of the best we've ever had. It's so good, we're thinking about ordering some for my daughter's birthday in September. Another thing that reminded me of the Philippines is while I was eating, I was sweating at the same time. It felt so good when we stepped out of the restaurant. The fresh air felt like air conditioned air compared to the air quality while dining in the restaurant. Will I go back to Ruby's?  YES! I smelled like food after but I liked what I ate, I was full after, and I'd definitely try other stuff next time. As I mentioned, the place is small.  However, the place is clean, the food is freshly cooked, the portion's very good, food tastes good.

The M.B. soup is a hearty soup, with the tiny mung beans(think lentil size but not as grainy), small cubed tofu, vegetables, all infused with a fish type aroma and flavor. They must stew fish in the soup while cooking it, because it definitely had a nice and solid fresh fish flavor. Very good and very filling. I really liked eating it on it's own, and also pouring it over rice. As for the fish head. Me personally, I really like the head of the fish.

2012-11-22,5.0,"Quite a while ago I wrote a quite lengthy review of this restaurant and babbled on and on about all the reasons I love it so much.  Well, it's time to update my review and declare to the world that I'm still in love with this place!  I'll try and keep this update much shorter than my previous one and if you're bored and want to read for 5 minutes you can read my prior review, but this time I'll try to keep it a more reasonable length. If you're wanting true authentic Filipino food this is the place to go!  If you're wondering how I can say this with such authority you can check out my prior review to see how this American who's never been to the Philipines can be so sure of this fact. As far as the bang for your buck goes their prices are very low, they also serve up top notch flavors and the serving sizes are very large. When I eat at this restaurant it doesn't just put a smile on my face while I'm eating, it literally makes me happy for the rest of the day!  If you want to get yourself in a better mood then the flavors here will do it for you. I'll finish this update with a recommendation (although all of their food is excellent).  Try the Longsilog meal.  Or if you don't feel like doing the whole big Longsilog meal at least order 2 or 3 of the Longinisa sausages and dip them in their vinegar dipping sauce.  I love it so much that I like to order it and have it for a desert after my meal!  Yeah, dipping sausage in a vinegar dip for a desert may sound kind of weird, but their vinegar dip has other ingredients in it too and it turns a very good sausage into one that is literally better than sex.  Try it, you won't regret it unless you just really dislike vinegar in which case they do also have a red sauce that you may prefer. Thank you to everybody at Ruby's for the really awesome flavors that brighten my days and also for the extremely friendly service!!!!",0.9944,0.786,0.167,0.046,0.5015183792815371

2011-11-17,3.0,"At the risk of getting checked by Ruby (or one of her sons/nephews), I can only give RFF an 'A-OK.' It was alright. Granted, I didn't grow up eating Filipino food but over the past few years, I have eaten a lot of it (both homemade and at restaurants) and I feel as though my palate is suitably trained to discern what's phenomenal, great, ok, meh, and awful. This was 'ok.' As mentioned in other reviews, you aren't coming here for the decor. Things like this don't matter much to me in a relative context. If I were paying $$$ for food, yes, it matters. If I am skating by with a $, just be sanitary and we're cool. There are few tables and lots of people who want to eat. I suggest dividing and conquering. Have one person stand in line. Have the other stalk a table. Much like a vulture, wait for those who seem weak and vulnerable. It's likely that even after waiting for your table prey to give up the ghost, your line-stander will still be standing. Again, LONG line. Doesn't move very quickly. After I finally ordered, a nice lady gave me the advice of shouting in my order (if I was getting one of the 'logs) when I got there and then, by the time I made it to the front of the line, my food would be ready. I like her style. Since I got that tidbit after I stood in line and ordered, I needed to wait a while for my food to be prepared. Surprisingly, I was ok with that. I'd rather have fresh food than old food. My buddy ordered that tapsilog and I ordered the tocilog. Be prepared to eat because you get a nice stack of food and the rice was deliciously garlicky. I like it. Egg is always welcome but the tocino... the tocino was lacking for me. Again, as mentioned in other reviews, it wasn't that sweet and it made getting through a dish that I usually tear up... a bit of a chore. I don't know whether Ruby's was unfairly (to it) hyped in my mind but I couldn't help but to be disappointed in my tocilog. I thought I may not have come to the right place when I asked my buddy how his food was. At my usual Filipino spot, the response is panting, face slapping and halleluyers. Not so here. The response was polite and muted. That's the wrong response. 'logs are TRUTH and one should feel the holy ghost when eating it. Something.was.wrong.

Ruby's has the buffet lunch during the weekends, or you could just order items turo-turo style.  Since the resto was crowded and hot (no air conditioning, just a standing oscillating fan) we decided to order some items and take it to go, in other words, a cooler environment.  I opted for the tocilog. The dish consists of Tocino--sweet marinated pork, fried eggs, and garlic rice. My favorite Filipino breakfast food.

You better believe we're in a Filipino restaurant. I was dying to go to a legit Filipino when we visited Chicago last weekend because 1) there are no Filipino restaurants in Minnesota 2) I've heard this place has good tapsilog, and 3) THERE. ARE. NO. FILIPINO. RESTAURANTS. IN. FLIPPING. MINNESOTA.  I was kind of bummed that they weren't doing a la carte when I was there with my gringo friends because they had to finish a huge order. (Of course, trust Filipinos to put on big parties and order every single thing of Ruby's menu). So I was forced to eat their buffet...as if that's such a harder option to take. They had a pretty awesome spread from the deliciously safe fried chicken, to callos, to chicken in sour broth, kare-kare (I have no clue how to say that in English), and dinuguuan, or blood stew. I've never really been a fan of blood stew, so can't comment on that dish. I will say the chicken was perfectly fried and it goes so well with the jasmine rice softened by the kare-kare's peanut-buttery sauce. DAMN I really want that in my mouth right now. Seriously authentic kare-kare, I kinda wished I asked for a side of bagoong.  The rest of the smorgasbord were equally delicious, and I loved their sweet corn dessert. Nothing beats a cold, rainy day than a nice, steamy cup of corn with coconut. Gaah, writing reviews while hungry is a dangerous pastime. I must go now and cry into my pillow because I realize I won't get to experience great Filipino food again until I go back to a city with great Filipino restaurants or I learn how to cook Filipino food besides chicken adobo.

Based on prior experiences, I knew that I disliked two things: buffets and Filipino food.  But I was hungry and wanted to go somewhere different in my neighborhood, and all of the positive reviews on Yelp brought me to Ruby's.   First off, I have never known that there were so many Filipinos in my neighborhood... maybe it could be that they are all just flocking to this place.  That's always a sign of a good ethnic restaurant.  The place doesn't look like much, kinda dinky even.  But the buffet was pretty good.  I had a variety of dishes, none of which names I really remember.  Their lumpia was really good, and the pancit was delicious.  In addition, I really couldn't stop eating this green bean dish that they had.  However, I'm still not the biggest fan of Filipino food.  I have only had it once before (and reviewed on Yelp) and hated it.  This is the second time that I tried a peanut butter flavored dish, and it wasn't that great to me.  Also, the food is greasy and somewhat salty... good, but only occasionally.  So I really can't give it more than three stars, but I totally recommend it.   But I'm glad I decided to put my preconceived notions aside and give this place a chance.  I'll definitely bring a friend or two here.",0.9788,0.805,0.155,0.04,0.5510662177328844

Catfish - deep fried goodness. 'nuff said. Machado - meat and potatoes with a tomato sauce. Well, everything they have is good - I don't want to rant and get boring but if you're lucky enough to catch kikiam on the menu, go for it.  It's like a Filipino meatloaf - mmmmmm.

When I started eating our first dish - pancit (noodles) with a beefy stew, my first thought was that the pancit were oddly matzoh-like, and the beefy stew tasted almost identical to this Russian dish my Jewish grandma makes.  Which is funny because the Philippines is by no means a Jewish country.  I felt funny eating what, to me, was sort of comfort food, while trying a cuisine I've had almost no experience with.  Sometimes taste links are so random. We also ordered tocilog, a plate of seasoned rice with egg and this almost candied mass of pork.  You better like garlic!  I do, and I loved this dish.  It was actually enough food for two people - never mind the beef stew and noodles.  Only with a huge amount of effort were we able to almost finish both. And then, of course, we had to see someone ordering a mystery drink and we had to order it too.  It came out stuffed with red beans, white beans, nata de coco, jackfruit strips, coconut milk, and grass jelly, and was the perfect accompaniment to a hot day.
