2017-08-15,1.0,"Did I have dinner at the same restaurant that has four and five star reviews? Unfortunately the only thing good about my experience was the company I had dinner with. Alana was our server, I would cut her some slack for being the only server IF she would have shown some customer service skills or even faked them. However her response was ""sorry (shoulder shrug) I'm just a simple employee."" I asked about red wine that doesn't contain sulfites. She said ""oh yeah we have it, no problem"" and even pointed on the menu which wine it was!! After having a glass, we notice the back of the label in bold letters reads CONTAINS SULFITES. So when I asked Alana, she admitted that she didn't read ""the entire back of the label... it was at the bottom."" I almost fell out of my chair that she admittedly lied. Furthermore, what if I what into an anaphylactic shock?! Thankfully that was not the case. Would the response be, ""sorry didn't read the whole label... just a simple employee."" The children's pasta dish was ordered to be penne pasta, ofcourse if was not. She offered to change it, but we had already waited nearly an hour and a half for our other dishes to arrive that no we were unable to wait for a do-over.

2017-07-26,3.0,"Antica Pizzeria is just fine. It's fine. Just. I came here with friends early (6pm) on a Friday night. There were five of us, so I made a reservation, just to be sure, and the woman who called me back was very courteous and accommodating, with just enough of an accent to get me excited. The sign out front said it was the best pizza in Chicago, as rated by the ""Hungry Haund."" Might want to change that. The inside was nice and cozy, and our table was waiting. So far so good. Antica used to be BYOB, and that was probably a good idea. One round of drinks was made by the bartender, the other by our server, and both took forever to arrive. We were almost done eating when our second round arrived. I ordered a negroni, my usual, and something went terribly wrong. It was cheap gin, bad vermouth, generic campari, or all of the above, because what came out was a slightly alcoholic Kool-aid. Undrinkable. The food, fortunately, was better. We ordered a couple of salads, a couple of pizzas, and a pasta for me. The Anica salad had plenty of olives and mushrooms, and the pere e gorgonzola had plenty of pears and gorgonzola. I had the rigatoni with cherry tomatoes and mushrooms, and which it didn't blow me away, it was solid. That was the take on the pizza as well. I'd go back, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so. It's the only place in the hood with a true cracker thin crust, so that's a plus. The owner's a nice guy -- he greeted us on the way out -- which makes me want to like this place more.

I am no expert on what is or is not authentic Italian. All I know is this pizza is really good and I'll be back.  But let's start with the bread. It came out warm and actually tasted like something- unusual these days. I usually ignore the lame bread that restaurants throw on the table because they feel obligated to do so. Don't ignore the bread here. I didn't order one  of the salads, but some people near us did and I was a little jealous of because of how good it looked.  Next time I will be ordering a salad as an appetizer, if we can eat that much.  The wife ordered the margherita pizza and I had the porcini mushroom and sausage pizza. Both were delicious.  I have noted in other reviews that wood burning oven baked pizza is often burnt to a crisp.  Not here. Whoever is baking the pies here is cooking them perfectly, which automatically makes them better than 85% of wood burning oven pizza that I have tried.

One had 80% Italian 20% cab (very drinkable so be careful!), the other glass we had was 33% one type of Italian wine, 33% another Italian (both I cannot spell and will update when we dine again), and 33% syrah.

I've been to this establishment twice now, and can say both times I felt like I was back in Italy enjoying a really special pizza.

2015-04-02,5.0,"This is one of those reviews that I'm afraid to write. I'm fiercely protective of what is really our favorite neighborhood restaurant, but they deserve the business. So, here I am. We've lived in Andersonville for years, and this is one of the places we go to again and again and again. In fact, it's probably one of the places we've been to the most in Chicago, and that's saying a lot; we like to try new eats, and we don't often go back to the same place twice. However, several times a year--and when we have company in town--we often find ourselves making our way down to Antica. Why do we love it so much? Oh, let me count the ways. First, the service is OUTSTANDING. I mean, really, they fawn over you. The waitstaff is professional and kind and efficient. My mom dropped something out of her purse while we were dining there today, and our waiter came over to pick it up before she even had a chance to bend over. Also, Mario, the owner, is always there. He will great you with a smile and a buttery Italian accent as soon as you walk in the door, and he'll make sure you've had a good time. The vibe of the restaurant is cozy and homey and oh-so-welcoming. It really feels like a family-owned neighborhood restaurant. But the food, of course, is the real star. The pizza, which is fired in their large pizza oven, is my favorite in the city. The crust is thin and floppy, the edges are blistered, and the toppings are fresh. They also have the best Italian salads and pastas I've had in the city. Every time I go, I find myself saying, ""This is just like the Italian food I grew up with!"" They regularly change specials, have a large menu, have delicious homemade desserts, and are reasonably priced. Truthfully, I can't think of a bad thing to say about this place.  Just go--you'll have a good time and a great meal. And you, too, will be back!",0.998,0.771,0.217,0.012,0.4549729064972968

I just recently dined here last weekend, after not visiting for close to two years. The food did not disappoint yet again.  I did, however, become a little irritated about one thing. Since the place is BYOB, and always has been, they decided to start charging a corkage fee (the server said they started it about a year ago). This is not stated on their website, which is frustrating.  We had a table of six on Saturday night, so had a couple bottles of wine with us. They then stated that they charge per bottle as well, not just a one time fee for corkage. It is $15 per normal sized bottle, and $20 per larger bottle. I understand restaurants needing to do this since they are BYOB, but let's not get carried away now.  So our table ended up just opening up one of the bottles for dinner and took the other one back home.  You are a great restaurant, Antica, but please fix your new rules with your BYOB (that are not stated on your website either). Thank you.",0.9352,0.889,0.092,0.018,0.4871843434343434

As I sit on the table super high price on corkage fee was very surprising. 15$ for corkage fee is little too over priced in my opinion. Second very surprising fact of this night was the fact waitress trying so hard to talk to a point that I could tell she was not Italian, which is not a big deal, in fact nice that she tries for working at an Italian restaurant but this made it impossible for me to communicate with her. I got Spinach salad, which was to be honest interesting for the fact that it had some crispy walnuts. Pizza I ordered was Pepperoni and Red pepper Pizza. It was around 14"" good for one person or along with a salad can fill two person comfortably. Though, there were around 4-5 slices of pepperoni on the pizza in total so their pizza did not make me happy either.  Overall my experience with this place was not good. It's very discouraging to check new restaurants in my neighborhood with their rating nowadays since, I have no idea how, some restaurants get higher rating but provide more expensive, money oriented and customer satisfaction is not as important, as I had this impression.",0.9677,0.795,0.146,0.058,0.5156165099268548

We took a seat and realized we were the only patrons there, but it was near closing time. The place is beautiful, brick and low light. We ordered wine and food, and everything came out fast and absolutely delicious. I had shrimp penne, others had pizza and the filet and nobody had any complaints. The staff was very animated, talking in loud Italian and laughing and drinking wine themselves. We wanted to head out as not to keep the staff past closing, but they heard we were celebrating a birthday and brought us tiramisu with a candle and sang happy birthday in Italian.

2014-06-22,1.0,"F this place. Haven't been in for a while but always liked it because the pizza was excellent, they were BYOB and they were usually not too crowded. The staff was always pleasant, the owner slung pizza in the back, always visited the tables to check on patron's meals.  After having not been in over a year we came in tonight and brought some beer. We learned that they now had wine (fairly expensive) and beer (crap and Italian). We also couldn't get a straight answer about the fees to bring our own, other than an exorbitant $15 corkage fee for wine. Turns out there was a $3 per beer fee. We ordered, we ate, it was all very quick because that's how you go to restaurants when you have a 2-year-old. He was well-behaved, he wasn't screaming or yelling, he wasn't walking around, he wasn't throwing stuff. I'm not one of those halfwits who thinks their child doesn't misbehave, or who thinks every scream and yell should be recorded for posterity because it's so precious. But my son was not misbehaving. Towards the end of the meal, as we waited for a rather long time for them to take our check and give us change our son started to get antsy. He yelled a few times, so my wife took him out of his chair and he walked towards the front door where he stood waving goodbye to people, or rather persons because the place was pretty empty. In fact he waved goodbye to two people who left. At this time the owner was standing at the hostess station, leaning on it, looking not amused because a child was standing there really doing nothing. He frankly looked pretty annoyed. He was wincing like he was getting a rectal exam actually. My son let out a few more yells and that's when the owner decided that he needed to tell us that we need to keep our child quiet, because people were trying to enjoy their meal. He had made a few noises, I didn't see anyone complain and I think I would have known because there were only two other occupied tables and one of them also had a young child at their table. So my wife picked our son up and told the owner that we were just trying to pay our check, and the owner kept hounding us about keeping our son quiet. Again, I'm not some halfwit who can't recognize when my child is misbehaving. I'm not the kind of idiot who would bring a toddler to Alinea, or any kind of fancy, quiet restaurant. But this place has many high chairs, and often has many kids in the restaurant when we have been in the past.  I'm not sure if business is bad and the owner just feels like being a smug dick to everyone, but that's what we experienced tonight and it was unfortunate, because I would tell anyone I knew about how great their brick-oven pizza was, how it wasn't anywhere near as crowded as some of the other brick-oven places in Chicago, how they were BYOB and it was a very casual, friendly environment.  So in closing a big F you to the prick owner of this place, who is shown in the foreground of at least one of the photos on the Yelp review. Don't go here if you have kids who make a few noises during dinner because you'll incur the wrath of an asshole who seems mad that his restaurant isn't very full, or that people don't want to spend way too much money on his wine and bad beer.",0.9719,0.824,0.102,0.074,0.5467070707070707

There is nothing I can complain about except for the fact that the amount of toppings and freshness kinda leaves the crust too soft to pick up a slice without everything sliding off of it or it falling apart. This seems to be a natural part of the Napoli style, as it happened when I had some at Eately. The best thing to do is eat it with a knife and fork. It's that good! I will be back and might try the pasta, but the pizza is so darn good it's hard to pass up. The food isn't the only thing about this place that makes it so wonderful to visit.

We ordered two desserts: tira misu and cannoli. The cannoli had a harder shell than I'm used to, but was very tasty. Tira misu was great.

It's BYOB with a nominal corkage fee, which is completely reasonable IMO.  They open your bottles for you, pour the wine, keep the glasses re-filled and also provide glass ware - none of that comes for free to them... Also, they will keep your beer or white wines cold in the back until you are ready or bring beers out one by one as you need them, complete service! Last time I was in, which is admittedly too long, they were talking about starting beer and wine service, which I think will be fantastic.  They said they would still keep BYOB as option for customers, that's very nice.  I love the BYOB option, but sometimes just ordering what a place has is nicer and easier. We like the pizzas, and pastas, and the salads, and the fish, and the... well you get the point.  Grilled octopus is especially wonderful.  We can come for a multi-course extravaganza or pop in quick for a lite meal - the perfect neighborhood spot.",0.9913,0.786,0.214,0.0,0.5453282828282828

We were dining with a group of 15+ people. Several small tables were pushed together, buffet-style, with the last table butted up against the wall. A few members of our party were' no shows,' so the last table (near the wall) was empty.  Understandably not wanting to waste a table they could otherwise fill, a staff member suggested that we all move down a table to free up the unused seats. Several diners in our group wondered aloud why it wouldn't make more sense (and be the more customer-friendly, accommodating thing to do) to just move our tables away from the vacant table, rather than asking a large party to get up, change seats, move our plates, wine/drinks, etc.. The gentleman sitting next to me commented that he dines out frequently - and had never experienced anything like this. Despite our unified grumbling, the owner(?) still seemed intent on moving all of us, rather than moving a small. empty table. My husband stood up, clearly not too pleased - but prepared to move, and suggested that they might at least assist in moving everyones' tableware, drinks, etc. I'm not sure what the owner thought he heard, but he went balistic, waving his arms around - advising us that if we ""didn't like it, "" we could leave. He then suggested that my husband had been giving his staff a hard time - even though his interaction with the waitstaff had consisted of ordering a soft drink, requesting his own plate of olive oil for dipping bread (they don't have bottles of oil on the table, and the communal dipping plate during flu season didn't seem like a good idea), and a few general menu questions.

They bake the pizza in a fiery brick oven that's got to be twice as hot as a regular home kitchen oven, our table got three different pizzas and they were all delicious.  I scoffed at the combinations they ordered on their pizzas, but the pizzas were better than my pasta, I think the secret here is the crust.  Almost any combination would taste good on this pizza crust.  My pasta was good, a carbonara (which, if I'm not mistaken, is actually Roman, not Sicilian, but I'm not sure), the pizza is much better.  My recommendation is that you come here with a group of three to five, each order a different pizza, and share.  Make sure at least a couple of your choices are vegetarian, those were some of the best combinations.  I thought the service was overall, pretty good. On the negative side, this is a really loud space.  Our friends are good conversation, but in order to have a conversation, you really have to shout, I was hoarse afterwards.  The tables are small for a pizza place, it was a squeeze to have three pizzas on our four-top, it's going to be a bit of a challenge to take my advice and to get four different pizzas for a group of four.  The table size isn't a big deal, but the noise level is, I value my hearing.  I've been in quieter sports bars.

Our entrees were Risotto Con Funghi Porcini and the Pappardelle Con Porcini E Asparagi.  The risotto was a bit bland, but the Papardellle was delectable. We finished the meal with a tiramisu.  It was served in a large martini glass and was heavy on the cream; the cake was sort of drowned in a sea of it.  It was pretty average, but perfectly serviceable if you're in the mood for a tiramisu.

We decided to give it a shot. Bustling with locals as we arrived we knew it might have been a good decision to come. Manager, Racie, welcomed my soon to be wife and I at a table for two. She was very pleasant and personable.  Soon we were eating their delicious wood fired pizza for an app and  shared a very tasty shaved Parmesan salad. While enjoying the atmosphere of locals I noticed the proprietor, Mario, chatting up the regular diners and families as they entered. Waiting at the podium to greet arriving guests Mario's eye caught my Wife's napkin AS it was falling to the ground. Within seconds he appeared with a new napkin for my bride to be. I watched as this whole event transpired and was impressed. It was then that I realized this place cares about what they do. Serve good food and care for their guest like family.  I looked at my wife and said ""We should have our rehearsal dinner here.""  And we did. It was amazing. Our guests loved the ambiance and the food and had a great time. Racie  was a fabulous and attentive host.  Everyone loved her. Mario worked feverishly in the kitchen churning out a fabulous menu, and the waitstaff was on their A game.  Wood fired pizza,  calamari, seafood risotto, filet mignon prepared amazingly, fettuccine pomodoro with mushrooms, delicious crab cakes, chicken with capers and white wine, skate fish with assorted vegetables and, to top it off, Grand Marnier vanilla semi fredo made in house by Racie herself.  It was all delicious and we got so many compliments on our choice to have our special dinner here.

2012-05-23,1.0,"Last evening we had dinner at Antica Pizzeria. It was a birthday party for my sister-in-law, consisting of seven people. We had reservations for 7:00 and upon arrival around 7:10pm, we were seated immediately.  Two members of our party were delayed and the wait staff asked if they could use the additional empty table to accommodate other guests. Without hesitation said ""Yes"", since at that point our two friends still had not arrived. Eventually our friends showed up and were easily accommodated at our table. The waiter, came over and took their order, served their pizzas a short time later, and everyone was satisfied.  The service was good, the pizza was good, and my chicken dish was acceptable. The waiter was attentive and at the end of our meal brought over the cake that we supplied; an all chocolate mousse cake that was delicious. We lingered over the cake and the sparkling wine.  Finally, the bill arrived, with some activity over the bill that we were sorting out with the waiter. All of a sudden the owner shows up screaming and I mean screaming, to, ""get out of my restaurant and never come back."" At this point he walked away from the table and sat down behind us at a table of two patrons (apparently his friends). My sister-in-law went over to the owner, saying, ""that he was out of line."" He responded again screaming at the top of his lungs, to ""get away from me and get out.""   We never even had time to sign the credit card bill and leave tips. We all got up and started gathering our belongings, while the owner kept screaming, ""to get out and never come back,"" as he held the door open. One of our friends who is Italian, started speaking to him in Italian, in order to possibly calm him down and find out the real problem. He told her that he wasn't Italian, but according to a bio on line, he is a ""proud native of Sicily"" (?)  So another fantastic birthday party in Andersonville. We were all in shock as the owner stomped back to his kitchen. There is another review of this restaurant in Yelp, which has a similar theme.

2012-05-22,2.0,"Italian restaurants are always hard for me. 1. I used to live in Italy.  I've eaten at restaurants where their meats were probably alive earlier in the day, hanging out next to the vegetables they would later be served next to.  I've been lovingly stuffed stupid by families that don't understand the meaning of the phrase ""Piu? Non posso!""  Hell, even Italian fast food was pretty nice.  So yeah, I'm hard to impress at Italian restaurants. 2. I'm an above average cook, and the wonder of Italian food is in its simplicity.  With a little effort, and maybe a trip to a nicer grocery store, I can competently duplicate a lot of Italian recipes. So, for me, Antica was already at a disadvantage going in to it all. I ordered their grilled calamari with baby octopus, followed by the gnocchi in a Parmesan wine sauce with ham and peas.  The calamari was good, but not amazing.  From what I've been told, it's a step up from the fried version of the same dish.  The gnocchi was actually quite good, and pretty balanced as far as the dumplings/sauce/ham/peas were concerned -- not something that I'm going to rush back to try again, but enjoyable. By leaps and bounds, the Cappuccino Pannacotta stole the evening.  And I hate coffee.  If this is indicative of their dessert menu as a whole, save yourself and come by for dessert.  Or just the Pannacotta.",0.9206,0.803,0.126,0.071,0.4522727272727272
2012-05-22,2.0,"Vindication!  I reviewed Antica at 2 stars back in 2011 and was continuously bewildered by their positive reviews, both on Yelp and in real life.  I figured I MUST have visited on an off night, so I readily agreed when this was suggested as a restaurant for our BYOB dinner group. My first impression of Antica this time was it was loud.  We were seated at a table for 8 and there was no way I could hear anyone I wasn't seated next to or across from.  Antica has one of those rooms where sound just bounces off the walls.  It creates a sort of buzz even in a mostly empty restaurant, but I wouldn't recommend it for groups if you care to hear each other. The bread was, again, great.  Remembering my horrible experience with the fried calamari this time I opted for the grilled.  It really was much, much better.  So far, so (mostly) good.  Then I got my main dish.  I'd ordered a pasta special that supposedly had mushrooms and pancetta with pasta in a garlic white wine sauce.  What showed up at the table had a red sauce (and very, very little pancetta).  My friend, who had ordered the same, asked the waiter if we'd gotten the wrong dishes.  He went back to the kitchen and reappeared telling us these were the right dishes and the menu was inaccurate.  He then asked ""So what do you want to do about it?""  My friend and I both found the way he handled this odd and but off-putting.  We opted to just finish the dishes since our friends were, by this point, mostly done eating.  No matter the sauce, the dish was really bland and dull.  We both tried doctoring it with the parmesan cheese on the table (in a shaker, no fresh parm or pepper, which would have helped) but it was a lost cause.  It was edible, but in no way worth the $17 menu price. Antica was slightly redeemed with the truly amazing panna cotta dessert and then, as Ericka said, damned by the corkage fee.  Despite what other Yelp reviews have said and the fact that I can't find this disclosure anywhere on their website, they DID charge us corkage - I believe it was 3.50 per bottle of wine and 2.50 for my friend's 6-pack of beer.   My friend who made the reservation mentioned that they told her they were BYOB when she called for the reservation, and even then didn't mention the corkage fee. That's it, Antica.  You're well and truly dead to me.  Your poor customer service and overpriced, lackluster food have been confirmed.  Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.",0.561,0.747,0.133,0.12,0.4606557856557858

However, I should emphasize that the pizza itself was the best part of the meal. I was only impressed with a few other items I tasted and service was hit or miss. We arrived and either the reservation was under a different name or the hostess was confused. They didn't seem to have our party of 7 scheduled, which wasn't a huge deal as the restaurant was far from full when we came on a Friday night. They seated us right away and put our BYOB and BYOV on ice. Complimentary bread was served up quickly and I quite enjoyed it. They brought out a second helping and our end of the table was ready to order. We indicated that we would like to order appetizers, but when others in the group weren't ready he simply walked away and didn't return for what seemed like forever. We ordered grilled calamari and it took a while to come out. It had a strange smell as well. I didn't let it get to me though, and was pleasantly surprised by how delicious it was. We ate it quickly and then waited forever for the rest of the food to arrive. I had the Parma pizza and loved it. I did not love the price. I believe that was a $17 pizza, which is absolutely ridiculous. I tried my friend's specialty pasta with a ""white wine sauce,"" but it was overloaded with a red sauce and had nothing much going for it. We pretty much all agreed that the experience was simply OK and felt a little better about it when the Cappuccino Panna Cotta was brought out. Unfortunately, the points gained back with the sweets were quickly knocked off again when our bill arrived and we discovered we had been charged a corkage fee which they never bothered to inform us about. For the record, I have no problem paying for BYOB, but at least let me know to expect it.

The food here is great.  And it's not the typical Italian meal where you leave and feel 10 pounds heavier.  Somehow they've managed to make pasta and pizza lighter fare.  Maybe it's the normal portion sizes, but there's also something lighter about the noodles.  Maybe because they're so fresh?  Any of the dishes with italian sausage are great.  In fact, if your pasta dish doesn't come with it, I highly recommend asking them to add it for you.  I think it's made in-house.  So good. The light bread that they serve before the meal is warm, soft and fresh and perfect for dipping in olive oil.  The salads are fresh and very tasty.  I haven't had the pizza yet, even though I keep saying that I will.  I just keep returning to the pasta. Also, ladies - a word of caution.  The owner is very Italian.  You may just fall for him.  He's very friendly and tries to make everyone feel welcome and at home.  If you're lucky, you may get a kiss on the cheek when you arrive or leave.  Watch out jealous boyfriends!",0.997,0.737,0.233,0.03,0.5138383838383838

The three pizzas we tried out were the following: Caltagirone, with sausage, spinach, and eggplant (ugh, so good); Parma, with arugula and parmesan (lettuce on pizza - surprisingly great); and the Padania, with prosciutto that melts in your mouth and mushrooms.  My personal favorite was the Padania, which... is unsurprising...it's pretty hard to mess up prosciutto. Our waitress was fantastic!  Such style and class - open, friendly, and witty, a perfect blend.

There were only two servers for the whole room (20 tables), including the party of eight next to us which Mario (an owner) joined later in the evening. Our server was unable to answer any questions about the menu. She told my friend that they were unable to eliminate the pancetta from a pizza or separate the gorgonzola from the pear salad (""We're too busy tonight.""). She appeared to be overwhelmed, and to be fair, there should have been more servers. One of our party did not receive his entree which was crossed out on the order; the rest of us shared our food. The room was very poorly lit which made it difficult to read the menu, and the clatter of dishes being dumped from cleared tables only added to the high noise level.

2011-06-15,5.0,"When I first moved to Chicago, I lived right around the corner from Antica Pizzeria and watched them grow and develop significantly over the past few years. They have maintained the essence of small family Italian dining without losing the characteristic warm nature, family home-table setting, and kind attitude that sets their service and small restaurant apart from the others. Without a doubt, one of the most friendly staffs in town, look for the original waitress (sorry i forget names) that started it all off and she will make sure you leave satisfied and stuffed.  Mario Rapisarda (Cocco Pazzo, Spiaggia) and Faris Faycurry (Dylan's Tavern, Villa Nova) created Andersonville's first wood burning pizza oven at Antica in 2008.  A native of Sicily, Mario serves as chef and creates regional Italian fare from scratch with authentic ingedients, constantly rotating and changing specials according to market availability. I have tried just about every salad and wood-fired pizza creation they have come up with and they are all good (havent disliked anything yet).  For pizzas, TRY THE SPECIALS! , If they ever have one combining sausage, pine nuts, olives, and greens of any nature or variety, GET IT. The salads are always clean and crisp, never over dressed, and leave you not overly stuffed on greens but rather, ready to devour your ZA with a clean palate. I also highly rec. the Carpaccio di Manzo (thin sliced tenderloin,  with an arugula and mushroom salad, topped with shaved parmesan cheese and an infusion of truffle oil, served with homemade crostini). How could Antica get any better?  Throw in a $0 corkage fee (woo hoo BYOB) coupled with reasonable prices and great family atmosphere, this andyville pizza fave is a no brainer on any budget and will leave your tasty buds happy you dined. GREAT for groups under 12 (call ahead for more) but be forewarned, while i used to be able to get any seat, any day, any time in late 2008, Antica is no longer a secret spot. Fortunately, the killer wait staff shouldnt have you waiting more than 15-45 minutes on even the busiest of nights (especially for 2-tops as they are very willing to split tables). Couldnt ask for a a warmer dining experience with friends or for a semi-romantic date when the lights are dimmed low at night.",0.9876,0.8,0.139,0.061,0.5889055001845699

The only knock I'd give it is for ambiance.  In a foodie neighborhood with well thought through restaurant interiors (e.g., Great Lake, Acre, Antiprima, Hopleaf and Vincent), Antica sticks out as the slightly less polished neighbor with its fake brick walls and dropped tile ceiling.  But seriously, who's complaining when the food is this tasty and you can tote in a magnum to wash it all down?",0.9224,0.739,0.167,0.094,0.6099647266313933

Intro: The table bread comes out hot and is paired with olive oil for dipping.  Good stuff.  The bread was sort of hollowed in middle but by design I'm sure.   The Crust: Their wood fired oven is no joke.  It produced a crust that had that great almost charred markings which brings out the quality of the dough for appearance, texture and taste.  One thing to note is the crust also included a softer texture at times...depending on what piece you got.  This was a perfect balance to me because I like a thin crust that can hold it's own but is still forgiving to an extent. The Sauce: A little sweeter than expected but complimented all our pies.  They don't use a heavy hand when dressing the pizza as well so it didn't overwhelm the toppings or turn the dough into rubber. The Service: We had great service, although we went during the week and it wasn't too busy.  Very accommodating and all the pizzas came out at relatively the same time.

Except my meal here was entirely forgettable. I came here a few weeks ago with friends for dinner, and I cannot remember for the life of me what I had, other than that I know it wasn't pizza. I think it was chicken, but I couldn't tell you what kind or what came with it. I remember it was good - not earth shattering good, but good enough. Except not good enough to remember several weeks later, and that's kind of a bummer. To me, the mark of a really good meal is when you can't stop thinking about it. Good food is food that is crush-worthy, am I right? I also remember it was pricey. I have no problem paying for a good meal, but the pricing just seemed steep for what seemed to be a neighborhood joint. There were a lot of regulars when we were in here though, so I'm willing to admit I might be wrong. Oh, and the tables had electric fake tea light candles. It kind of cheapened the atmosphere for me a little bit. Why not just splurge on the real thing? A bag of tea light candles are what, a dollar at Ikea? Come on, Antica.

Alas, the ""cornicone"" is nonexistent and some of the pies are overloaded. It would also be nice to see them get a little more artisinal with their ingredients, which are generally of commodity quality.

Our server was on us constantly.  It is BYOB and she graciously opened our wine and handed out menus.  When we told her we just wanted to talk and catch up first, she walked away and came back literally 5 minutes later asking if we had made a decision yet.  My friend said (again), ""Actually we are just catching up so it might be a bit before we order"".  She walked away and came back again - no kidding - 5 minutes later.  So we ordered. Two of us had pizzas (one arrived unsliced), one had pork chops which he said were too small and dry, and I had spaghetti.  The two entree dishes seemed very small comparatively to other restaurants.  The spaghetti was a little TOO al dente and could have used more sauce.  No grated cheese was provided or offered, and I was surprised that nothing else came with the spaghetti - no bread, rolls, or even a sprig of parsley.  I ordered spaghetti and that's what I got. We had gone through two of our 3 bottles of wine and cracked the last one open.  Three of us were finished, but one was still eating his pizza and talking.  The server asked him three times if he was finished and each time he responded, ""Not yet, I'm eating and talking"".  Finally on the 4th time, my friend exhaustively said, ""Yeah, I guess I'm done."" The bill came and we continued to chat.  The server returned 5 minutes later.  We weren't ready to pay yet.  She left and came back again - 5 minutes later - this time picking up the check and looking around as if she was looking for money.  We asked her to come back.   The place was not crowded.  There was no rush to turn our table over.  We ate dinner early (met at 7) so I doubt we were keeping her from leaving.  And even if we were, we - as guests - should never had been made aware of that.  Not sure what the problems were all about, but I doubt we return to see if they get fixed.",-0.7494,0.889,0.052,0.06,0.3127777777777778

2009-05-25,3.0,"I really want to write a good review for Antica Pizzeria, but after visiting last night for a second time, I can't give the enthusiastic recommendation that my first visit would have precipitated.  On my first visit back in November, not long after the restaurant opened, I found their pizza to be fantastic. A great balance of ingredients on top of a crispy, delicate crust flavored with just the right amount of wood burned char. That time we had the Margherita and the Funghi (mushroom) pizzas, and the Margherita was the standout. Last night the balance was gone. We again ordered two Margheritas for three people. What arrived looked different, we could not see the basil leaves that last time had been placed on top. More alarming, both pies were swimming in red sauce with a heavy helping of mozzarella on top.  It was all too much, obscuring both the flavor of the basil and the otherwise sublime crust. On top of that, the pizzas nearly turned into a gloppy mess. Yes, Antica's red pizza sauce is very good and balanced in its own right, but was applied with a way-too-heavy hand.  Still a little hungry, we ordered a Funghi pizza to see how that compares to our first experience. Again, it was a disappointment. There was too much cheese by half, making for another sloppy, gloppy affair, overwhelming that poor crust. The mushrooms were poorly integrated into the pie, sitting on top, seeming mostly dessicated, rather than integrated into the cheese.  After our Margherita pizzas were consumed a gentleman came by to ask how the pizzas were -- I assume he was the owner or manager. I told him that there was too much sauce, and he responded to the effect that it customers are always asking for more sauce, and then he went on to tell me how they make their sauce with fine Italian tomatoes.  If it's true that the market is demanding more sauce--to the extent of drowning an otherwise excellent pizza--then I guess I'm way out of step with that market. I was excited to go to Antica Pizzeria again yesterday, but now I'll be less inclined to visit again. Instead I'll seek out some of the other wood-fired pizzerias in Chicago, even if they're a little further away from my Rogers Park home. I also have to say that the service yesterday was spotty, though I'm willing to give them some slack because it was a Sunday during a holiday weekend. It seemed like we had to beg to order another pie after eating two pizzas and two salads, and the hostess also seemed to have to fill in for the waitress to make sure tables were being taken care of. Another disappointment from the more competent service we experienced the first time around, on a Friday no less.  The salads we had, one based on arugula and the other with pear and gorgonzola, were both very nice and tasty. No revelations, but no disappointments, either. They get points for being BYOB, too. It's not too late for Antica Pizzeria to walk back from the edge of mediocrity. I hope they make that choice.",0.9912,0.799,0.136,0.065,0.4644077232883203
2009-05-10,2.0,"I read the glowing Red Eye review of this place and decided to take my mom here when she came to help me move and was actually embarrassed by how bad the majority of our food was. We ordered the bruschetta to start, and it accounts for one of the stars I've given Antica - the house flat bread was a nice change of pace, and the goat cheese was a very nice complement to the sweet tomato topping.  We should have stopped there. Then came our pizza (I forget the name, but it was listed as a house specialty and involved sliced potatoes), which was soggy, floppy and bland.  We're not talking New York-style 'foldable' here - we're talking waterlogged, this-pizza-has-been-sitting-under-a-tepid-heat-lamp floppy.   Between the three of us (me, mom and boyfriend with the stomach of a garbage disposal), we ate two slices.  The spicy spaghetti with prosciutto we ordered was just as bad - bland noodles, the oiliest sauce I've ever experienced, and tough chunks of meat. Our waitress noticed that we had barely touched our food and asked if everything was fine - we told her that we were disappointed and showed her how soggy our pizza was and she was very apologetic and offered us dessert.  We would have preferred to just have the inedible food comped, but she insisted on dessert and I'm actually kind of glad she did.  We had some sort of ice cream dome with one flavor on the outside and one in the middle (I don't know the name as she picked it for us)- delicious, and worthy of the other star in this review.",0.6966,0.862,0.077,0.061,0.5849116161616162

We ordered diet cokes and they came in tiny 8oz bottles for $2.50 each, I know they are trying to be unique but c'mon that is a bit much. The pizza were decent, albeit kind of unexciting, even though I ordered the most ambitious one including ham, hard boiled eggs, and peas. I found the prices to be a bit high as well for the atmosphere/amount of food.

2009-03-10,5.0,"... And I was starting to worry about Chicago foodies...  Let me explain. In the last several months, I had been getting to the point of wondering what the deal was with people in Chicago. I mean, I see New York restaurants and their diversity (price-wise, atmosphere-wise and food-wise), authenticity for the most part (I find that New Yorkers have a real appreciation for that which is genuine) and creativity (in both high end and low end ways). Then there's Chicago - high end restaurants struggle, creative restaurants struggle, foodies are so few as reflected by the fact that we find average dining establishments in this city packed because of who owns it and who's hanging there... and the list goes on. Don't get me wrong - I LOVE this city; it is afterall, my home.  But, I've been so concerned about Chicago dining and wondering why it was we could not get a decent neopolitan pizza experience in this city.  Then we dined at Antica last night... truth be told, I had been to Antica on 2 prior occasions and each of those occassions, I felt it was above average... such that I really had not been too interested in a return visit.  Then, last night, I was told by other foodie friends that changes were implemented recently and that the pizza was as good as one would get neopolitan-wise in this city.  That's a pretty bold statement... So, thus, we returned last evening.  My summary:  1. Stick to the pizzas, salads, grilled calamari and the simpler pastas and you'll be singing to the heavens. Antica does each of these almost perfectly. The pizza crust is tasty, chewy enough, charred just enough and is in all respects, wonderful. My fave pizzas are the salame and the fennel sausage with roasted pine nuts. The grilled calamari is to die for - enough said there. The salads (most in the baby arugula range) are italian simple - i.e. with just enough dressing, parmigiana, goat cheese or toppings as is necessary depending on which one you order. The simpler the pasta, the better there (i.e. I've had the ragu on 2 occasions and personally, it's not my fave there)... go for the rigatoni on the regular menu (with sausage and peas) and you'll really be satisfied.  2. Service is 5 star +!!!! I have absolutely no complaints and never have on this issue. The staff and owners are friendly, accommodating, warm and sincerely dedicated to having everyone enjoy their time there.  3. The BYOB thing is probably the one thing that Chicago people definitely get - good for them (I rarely see BYOB in Manhattan). I hear that the owners want to stay BYOB as their guests really love it. Big plus for Antica.  4. There's no espresso here; the drip coffee is tasty... but, Antica, I hope to one day grab an espresso after such a great meal.  5. For locals, coming on a week night is a must. Weekends are just too busy and packed; if you want a more leisurely meal, the week night setting is the way to go.  Antica is one of my new favorites and I simply can't wait to return.",0.9921,0.841,0.126,0.033,0.4709249218523412
