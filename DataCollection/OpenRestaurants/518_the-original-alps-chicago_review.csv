This appears to be one of those places, however some dishes are suspect. To mention any particular menu item is pointless if food is fresh and prepared with a modicum of care the meal will express that. That's what  I use as a gage to measure the true value of an establishment. Otherwise it's just not worth mentioning.

Why is the default cheese on an omelette american cheese? Sure it's cheaper for Alps to use, but why? It's not as good as cheddar. Also, prices for said omelette are high- over $8, but if you come weekdays before 9am, its on special. That's another thing too- they aren't very flexible on specials. If it says ham and cheese and you're vegetarian, they gave us a hard time about getting it minus the ham for the special weekday price (are you kidding?). Lunch is good, and priced way better than breakfast. I get a chicken sandwich with mushroom, cheese, and bacon, plus soup, and fries for the same price as the omelette.  The service tends to be very good most the time, there sometimes is a wait on weekend mornings which moves fast.

Last time I was there, my friendmade it very clear to the waitress that she is allergic to bread, and 4 minutes later the waitress plopped a basket full of bread right in front of her face. I guess you can't expect diner staff to be aware of food allergies, but come on. It didn't exactly inspire her to feel safe about her meal. The owner is a real crazy person, definitely the agressive macho type. What a jerk. I've seen him badger customers and employees. One time me and some friends waited a really long time for the server to even glance at our table. Finally one of us went to the front counter to ask if we even had a server because we were about to walk out the door. The server finally came over and gave us this big attitude, and she kept saying, ""what's the problem? I gave you this sign (sticks pointer finger in the air), like, one minute, I was telling you to wait one minute, what's the problem?"" The problem is we didn't see your hand gesture across the room, and we want service, not to attitude and ""one minute."" How rude and just plain stupid. The food is OK, basically the same thing you can find at many similar pancake houses. One thing I noticed is that, according to my taste buds, their food is seriously and consistently under-salted. That leaves everything just a little bit bland. Considering you can find this EXACT food at every other diner in Chicago, the prices are way too high. I would probably never would have gone here if it wasn't sooooo close to where I live. As it was, I used to eat at Alps about once a month since they opened, just for the convenience (worth noting that I always regretted the greasy expensive meal once I get the inevitable Alps stomach ache). However, I can say I will never, ever be going back after my last experience. It was just one thing after another and we ended up walking out and happily finding better food elsewhere. I was a regular, and they've lost my business forever.

I never got a chance to eat at the original Alps West, which is a shame because I've known about its existence way back in the day. How far back? Yellow school bus back. But as luck would have it, what ended up bad for WaMu, turned out to be good for Alps. Anyhow, back to the present. My friend and I stopped here for late lunch. We were both surprised how big the dining space is. I don't know how big the original Alps West was, but the place was very airy. The place was over half full of people when we arrived. Mainly regulars, who appeared to be on a first name basis with the staff. Still it was a nice balance of older, neighborhood folks, with young couples, and a few solo diners reading their papers or smart-phones. We were seated in a comfy booth by the window and promptly ordered coffee before the menus even hit the table. We both ended up having our standard breakfast fare. Pancakes, sausage links, scrambled eggs, and hash browns.  Our food came out super fast. The links were tasty, definitely more than a few steps above your generic diner special. The pancakes were slightly on the dry side, but nothing a few pats of butter and syrup couldn't solve. Eat your hashbrowns quickly, as they taste mushy when cold. But to our horror, the scrambled eggs were made from egg mix. Major downer in my book. Even the ""cheapest"" diners I've eaten at use actual eggs. On the other hand, the coffee was good. Yes, coffee is an important part of the diner experience and this one passes. The rest of the menu looks promising. My friend wants to try the pork chops, I saw a few sandwiches and omlettes that look appealing. We will be back. Pros: Wide menu variety, good coffee, reasonable prices, reasonable seating area, parking lot available across the alley behind the building, good coffee, friendly feel of staff and regulars, the ambience...it's weird sitting in place that a few years ago was still a bank. The interior still has a hint of WaMu in it. Cons: Tell me you did not use egg-mix to make my eggs! The ambience may be too new for some accustomed to old school grime on the wall diners.

Chorizo is a gift from the Mexican Gods that I rarely turn down. When my plate was served, I almost shed a tear. The Chorizo was bulging from the Eggy dish, and the hash browns were crisped to perfection. The meal tasted even better than it looked.

2010-03-24,4.0,"Hey, to me, a diner's a diner.  Basic, fast, cheap.  I have learned not to expect much.  And I actually had not expected much of the new Alps, but after going there twice and being turned away (one because the wait was around 45 minutes and the other because we didnt realize they closed at 3pm), I was suddenly stricken with the NEED to go there.  Sort of like this juvenile reaction to not receiving a desired toy... WANT, NEED, HAVE TO HAVE.  So finally, on a remarkably crap-tastic Saturday, with a windy, wet snow falling at a rapid pace, we took my out of town friend and attempted the Alps for the third time.   We were seated almost immediately and presented with a migraine inducing menu...so many choices!  I finally decided on their take of huevos rancheros, which came with warm corn tortillas and hashbrowns.  Not the most authentic dish, but prepared well and tasty.  The service was good and they kept us in water and coffee the whole time.  I also appreciated the design of the place, which was clean and modern and not pink and hokey like some diners I have been to.  I guess the third time really is the charm.  I liked the Alps and would not hesitate to return.  Also the fact that it is convenient to where I live is a big bonus!",0.9907,0.777,0.189,0.034,0.4033724340175953
2010-02-14,3.0,"I'm a bit biased as this is quite close to home, but it's a diner and is what it is. The people here are quite friendly, except the cashier when you block his payment line. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated on a Sunday morning. Getting our food did take longer, and I never did get my coffee. Also my ""healthy choice"" breakfast ended up having hashbrowns instead of fruit. But damn the egg white omelet was huge! We'll be back... maybe because we live so close. Maybe because the food is quite delish when you do finally get it.",0.5546,0.818,0.103,0.08,0.4857142857142857
2010-02-08,5.0,"Much better than WaMu.  I was really pissed when Alps closed down to be replaced by a dying bank, and I waited eagerly for a restaurant to open up again when I heard the news of Washington Mutual's death.  It's your typical family breakfast place and much more modern than the old Alps. I have yet to recieve bad food, bad service, or anything to complain about. They have a good early bird special, kick-ass location, balls to the wall poached eggs and it's quite possibly the best thing that's happened to the neighborhood in the last 3 years.",-0.5154,0.708,0.136,0.156,0.4270774976657329
2010-01-29,2.0,"This neighborhood desperately needs a breakfast spot, so when Alps reopened in late 2009, it was a blessing.  I am thankful just to have a place to walk to in the morning to get some quick eats.  However, the servers do come off as overwhelmed, and the kiddie pancakes were possibly microwaved.  My dishes were typical of diners, not that I care to admit I eat in them often, but the food was edible.  If you need someplace to go that's near by your house and it doesn't need to impress, then this is the place.  I would not ever drive to this place, nor suggest it to friends outside of the neighborhood.",0.5231,0.846,0.096,0.058,0.5785714285714285
2009-12-17,4.0,hrm... maybe they cleaned up their act? after reading some of the other reviews i was shocked at the comments about poor service and long waits. i've never had a problem with either. even on a saturday or sunday morning i've always been seated immediately and had fast friendly service. onto the important... they've got skillets and lots of em. the gypsy skillet is my go to breakfast when i can't be bothered to make decisions or try anything new.,0.2547,0.847,0.089,0.064,0.5911931818181818
2009-11-10,5.0,"I'm really surprised at all the negative reviews! We had a great experience here. We walked in early on a Sunday afternoon and were promptly greeted and seated by a very friendly woman. The place was 3/4 full and very clean.  We were immediately served hot, delicious coffee. Now, I know this doesn't do it for everyone, but I was really pleased they had flavored creamers at the table. Score.  We had typical breakfasts...an omelet and pancakes...and it was delicious. There was so much food, and it was all hot and fresh. The waitstaff was attentive and kept the coffee cup full. When the bill came, it was more than reasonable for all the food we received.  I am very happy to have this place in my neighborhood. But you should stay out. I don't want to have to wait in line.",0.9792,0.783,0.193,0.023,0.6955
2009-10-10,2.0,"Placed in a counter seat on a busy Saturday morning.  Waited 15 minutest for coffee and 35-40 minutes for my omelet and toast. When it arrived it was warm, not blazing hot, suggesting to me it had been cooling on a counter somewhere.  I'm pleased to see this location a restaurant again;  the neighborhood needs a good breakfast and lunch place.  But I won't hurry back.",0.7717,0.881,0.119,0.0,0.5583333333333333
2009-09-27,1.0,"Walked a mile to get here ... Was a lovely walk ... Only to be greeted with the inept ""keeper of the names"" ... She couldn't read her own list, couldn't advise on a wait time, and was just generally disorganized ... I know it's just recently opened, but the folks running this place look old enough to have been involved in an opening or two in their time ... Floor plan wastes space that could be leveraged for revenue (i.e. shorter wait times, etc) ... Will probably be successful because it's equidistant of two Golden Nuggets ... Might try again, might leave it to those who appreciate chaos",0.6956,0.826,0.107,0.067,0.5650000000000001
2009-09-25,4.0,"I have been waiting for MONTHS for this place to open, and finally they did!  It was crowded for a Friday morning, and full of children that should have been in school. We were served fresh, hot coffee and water right away. Our server, Jeanne, was attentive and sweet. It was her second day on the job, and some jerk at the table next to us was complaining about his toast incessantly. She handled it with grace.  We ordered the Veggie Skillet for my husband, and I ordered Ladies Special #1 (eggs, pancakes, and toast)! Our food took a while, but they were busy. I loved the extensive menu, and the bright, sunny atmosphere in this Greek-owned restaurant. Our food was solid, decent, and the portions are generous. But, sorry ALPs, the pancakes are better at the G.N. (golden nugget).  I will definitely come back to try a Sassy Salad or something off of the Waist Watchers section. I love restaurants that are Weight Watcher Friendly!!!",0.9922,0.74,0.236,0.024,0.5273809523809523
