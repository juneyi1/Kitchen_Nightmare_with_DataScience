Our burger all came out at different times.  I had finished my fries before another 2 burgers came out.  4 minutes passed before the last burger arrived at our table.  By then our server had disappeared entirely and was seemingly avoiding us even though we simply wanted another round of drinks. Then he hovered while one of us was cashing out and was anxious to get his merchant copies/cash and get away. All in all the menu, location, and ambiance is great.  Rockit is within walking distance of Wrigley field.

It was not very packed at all and there were a lot of empty tables around me, but somehow the service was very slow. It was 20 minutes before anyone even acknowledged that we were sitting there.

No one ever approached us. Wasn't happy with that.  The food was average. I ordered the truffle mushroom burger and it wasn't anything spectacular. On the menu, it states that truffle fries come with this burger, but I didn't get those with my order. Again, another thing I had to stop one of the waiters for. They eventually brought the fries out, but told me that my burger did not come with these fries. The menu in the restaurant said they came with them and I pulled up the restaurants menu on my phone and it stated that the fries came with. So I was confused. If they changed something, then that should be reflected in the menu.  I know that these are all little things, but it's little things that make or break an experience. I would say that I would maybe come back on a day that I'm drinking and going to a cubs game. But who likes waiting for food and service when they have alcohol in their system? Not me!

WE ordered the Rockit Pockets appetizer.  Which is basically an egg roll stuffed with chopped steak, onion and cheese.    They were good.  My only complaint, the order came with two that were cut in half  So, each of us got a half.  The menu did not indicate this.  If we would have known, we would have ordered 2 of them.   My husband ordered the double cheeseburger, which comes with Merkt's cheese.  I ad the grilled chicken which comes with roasted red pepper, gouda, red onion and avocado spread.  I ordered the garlic parmesan topped fries.  My son ordered the kids chicken tenders.  My brother in law ordered the black angus burger.   The food was really good.  My chicken sandwich was a good size portion.  Given the amount of food that was between the buns, it was the right amount of each and easy to eat.  I would definitely order it again.  The garlic parm topped fries were great.  I'm not a big french fry person, and I could not stop eating these fries.    My husband really enjoyed his burger.  He said the deli mustard was just right and didn't overpower the sandwich, which was messy, but he didn't care.     My son's chicken tenders appeared to be hand breaded, it did not say so on the menu, but they did not look like your standard restaurant cookie cutter tender.  They were perfectly tender and juicy on the inside and not greasy.     The waitress was really nice, but a bit slow.  She brought out a 2nd cola for my son, when we said, after he finishes his soda he is to switch to water.  When my husband told her we don't want him to have another.  She said ""I'll just leave it here for somebody to drink.""  None of the rest of us were drinking soda.  I said ""No, take it away.""  My other complaint is that the table was not cleared.  We had to ask her to take away the appetizer plate, which sat empty on our table for a long time.  Even when our food was brought out, she still didn't remove the appetizer plate.   My son really enjoyed the trivia night and asked if we can return for another.  So, it looks like we will be back.",0.9657,0.854,0.094,0.052,0.47359022556390973

You could tell they were working as hard as they could. I expected that my drinks wouldnt be refilled but they were always on top of it. Its like they have some hi-tech glasses which lets them know when it is getting low. Even being beyond packed, we still got plenty of attention from the staff and were never ignored. The food, however, was ok. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't memorable. My Waygu burger was average but a little bland. I dont know if they seasoned the meat at all because I couldnt taste it, but after adding my own salt, it improved a little. My girlfriend was not a fan of her turkey burger for the same reason... just very bland. The fries were crispy but do not eat them plain. I had the truffle fries and they were delicious. My girlfriend barely touched her plain fries and that isnt like her.  The food was a little bit of a wait. Granted, Im sure it was busy when I arrived but you cant really tell how big this place is. Upon entering, you see a bar and like 5 tables, but I think they have eating behind the bar wall and they also have a lot of seating outside.  Overall, not a terrible place to visit before a Cubs game. We arent impressed with the food in Wrigley, and we have tried  a few pizza places around there that we werent impressed with.

Later, I went by the restaurant to see people out on the patio and heard they were charging $100 a head to just get into the bar (this was the same amount I had agreed on for a table). I guess this establishment cares nothing about commitments they made and realized how much more they could make by charging a cover and not having their tables taken up for the whole game.

Our waitress went to fix it and made a big deal about how much time it was going to take for her to get it situated then she comes back and didn't really get the situation fixed and ran away the second she dropped of the bill.

Our food took almost three innings of the game to arrive with no apology and at one point, our server was scrolling through her phone for so long that another customer who had been trying to get her attention for almost 5 minutes literally walked up to her and confronted her for whatever it was she needed. If you need to scroll through Facebook for that long (while laughing at her screen, no less) at least take it to a back part of the restaurant and not outside in front of customers. After all this, we decided to leave a 10% tip and we were harshly confronted by her again as we were leaving: ""Was something wrong? You only left me a 10% tip?"" We were all so taken aback to be confronted so suddenly and were put in such an awkward position by her, we mentioned the slow service and tried to leave.

2016-08-06,3.0,"""Grease lightning, go grease lightning"" was playing in my head as the juice from the burger slowly, but surely oozed on down my arm.  Although the grease factor was moderately high, I was definitely NOT singing that, ""I can't get no satisfaction"".  The burgers here at Rockit Burger Bar are more than satisfactory, but they're also the only part of the experience that scored ""above-average"".  Personally, I'm a fan of relaying good news before bad news, so let's go over how scrumptious the burger was, shall we? Although a majority of the burgers sounded appetizing, I decided on the BFD Burger which stands for bitchin' & fantastically  diabolical (not really, but it should).  This burger had glazed donuts for buns...is there really a need to continue telling you why this burger is so good?  Two of my favorite food items - burgers and donuts - were smushed together to make a sinfully delicious creation and I was lovin' it.  The sweetness of the donuts worked extremely well with the fried egg and the bacon stacked on top of the patty; my only complaint is that the patty wasn't that big.  I felt a teeny tiny but jipped when having a substantially smaller burger placed in front of me when I knew I was paying the same price for this burger as I would for a much bigger one at Kuma's Corner.  Again, the burger was great and messy, but I loved every minute of it.  The curly fries that came with this were also thumbs-up good! I had gotten a shake with my burger because after a couple beers I was a little dried out.  I was so looking forward to this shake, but I was a little befuddled as to why it was served only half full.  I didn't get a chance to ask because the bartender (I sat at the bar) was gone as quickly as she'd come.  Anyway, I'd gotten the Butterfinger milkshake per the suggestion of the bartender, but it was half full and at the bottom there was an inch or two of pure candy bar I could even slurp up...so basically, I got 1/3 of a milkshake...so sad.  Going back to the service, though - it was decent but not great.  It got better the longer I was there, but initially I was treated as if I was a ghost at the bar - it only took about 5 stare-down's to get acknowledged.  I'm not even going to elaborate on the air-headedness of the bartenders.  While we're on the topic of the bar: there was an okay selection of beer, and although I'd have  preferred a different and better selection, they did try to have a good (enough) variety of local breweries.   Finally, the environment was totally fine...if it weren't for the influx of people (somewhat obnoxious people) I would been perfectly tolerant of the chill vibe in Rockit Burger Bar.  Being the introvert that I am, I'm not so fond of loud, overly intense people which is what this bar (but really, the entire area) attracts.  That's not really any fault of the restaurant, but it's a personal preference that didn't align correctly.   Overall, the food was great, but it might not be the most cost efficient, especially since their appetizers are pretty much the same price as the burgers - weird???  And beware, if you want to make a reservation you won't be able to do so on a Cubs game night...I understand, but it's an inconvenience all the same. Moral of the story: I thoroughly enjoyed the burger, but I wouldn't be so inclined to come back because none of the other burgers sparked this ""oh-my-god-I-have-to-have-it"" attitude within me.",0.9979,0.758,0.179,0.063,0.5433044733044735

My first dining experience was memorable, which was the reason I decided to order takeout from them as my work schedule permits very little dining out. Unfortunately the food on both occasions was a despicable mess. Getting through to the actual restaurant to speak with a living person was as hard as trying to make a direct call to the President of the United States. When the telephone was eventually answered, I had the displeasure of speaking with a surly gentleman who sounded as though I had just ruined his entire day by changing my french fries to curly fries.

2016-07-06,2.0,"Came here with my family (5 of us total) on the 4th of July Cubs game day well before the Cubs rush. (Arrived around 10:30 on a 1:15 game day). We were seated quickly with 3/5 of our party, but had to ask not to be seated in the back part of the (pretty empty) patio next to the dumpsters. This request was met without hesitation. Then the fun began. Sent two Bloody Mary's back because they were so tasteless. And the salted rim tasted more like soggy bread than salt. Gross. Then, waited 45 minutes for our food. Which was surprising, as Billy Dec himself was there and his (enormous) party was served within moments of their arrival. I guess those are the perks of owning the restaurant instead of being a paying customer. Lastly, you would think a burger bar would be able to cook a burger medium vs. medium rare. All the burgers were cooked the same despite being marked as different. And it's not like they were great, either- my truffle mushroom burger was pretty dry (as were everyone else's burgers) and I barely tasted any of the other flavors I was expecting. Like truffle. And mushroom.  The truffle fries, however, were fantastic- the best part of my meal. Again, at a burger bar. Quite disappointing. Probably won't be back.",0.9865,0.76,0.182,0.058,0.4868279569892473
2016-07-04,1.0,"First of all I don't like writing bad reviews. Also my review has nothing to do with the quality of the food served, I have heard that there burgers are excellent. I'm not sure if this is true as we never ended up getting our food. This review is about the poor and extremely slow pace of service. I arrived at Rockit Burger roughly an hour and a half before a Cubs game in July with my Dad and we both ordered a Farmhouse burger. Since it was gameday we expected the service to be slower than usual. The place wasn't crowded, probably less than half capacity. After we placed our orders our server appeared about as often as a blue moon. We waited well over an hour for our food before we went to find our server. After finding our server we asked her about the state of our order. She told us the kitchen was backed up and the cooks hadn't started on it yet. Remember this is 75 minutes after placing our order for 2 burgers in a restaurant that was less than half full. At this time it was about ten minutes before first pitch, so we chose to leave and just eat at the park. On the way to the park I saw some reviews here on yelp describing some very similar experiences that my father and I had experienced. If you are not in a rush and can deal with extremely slow service than this is a good option due to the supposed quality of the food served. If your in a rush, or trying to eat before a Cubs game I recommend that you find somewhere else to eat as you will have to wait a very long time to receive your food.",0.8617,0.912,0.06,0.028,0.41927983539094654

A few minutes later we order our meals... I may be a vegetarian but I am not by any means a picky eater, I even eat fish from time to time.  I order the Tuna sandwich off the menu, nope they don't serve that anymore. Ok.. may I get the mushroom burger then, nope they're out of that.  Alright then I'll order a pizza. Nope cannot have that either..  So what are my other options you ask? Salad & hummus with vegetables.. or the mac n cheese I have already eaten, really? I'll pass, thanks!  I come to restaurants to eat innovative food I cannot or typically do not make at home.. not for some vegetables thrown in a bowl. I asked to speak with the manager, the rudest most unpleasant man with the biggest smirk on his face emerges outside and basically tells me he does not care half of their menu options are unavailable, its not their fault they are changing their menu around at this time and its my choice not to eat meat. Ok then.. I won't order anything.  He proceeds to tell us to have a great night and we can leave..  I have never felt more discriminated against because of my food choices in my life.  Most Billy Dec restaurants I have been to have vegetarian friendly options, which is great but please make them available to those with dietary restrictions.  If they are not available that should have been the first thing the waitress told us, if it was we would have never sat down and wasted our time. Reading other reviews it seems to me that this is a HUGE problem this inconsiderate restaurant has. If you do not want vegetarians to come to your restaurant just put a sign up and trust me, we will not.  There are MUCH better places to eat than this hole in the wall they call a burger bar.  Heads up, BURGER does NOT require meat to be in the middle of two lousy buns.  Oh, and get rid of the pompous a-hole you have managing your joint.

We then asked if we could have the kale Caesar salad with tuna and we were told they have no tuna. In other words, aside from the burgers, they had virtually nothing left on their menu. The explanation was that the pizza oven was out, and their menu is in transition. We were encouraged to return subsequently and see that the new menu would feature veggie burgers. That obviously did us no good at 7:30 at night when we were hungry for dinner. Of course, would've helped had the waiter told us this information the moment we sat down and got our menus, but they seemed  to think it was irrelevant to share what the kitchen could actually serve.

Were convinced it was just deep fired noodle bites. Again, these were bland as all get out. Needed not only salt, but other spices to give it some flavor. They give you siracha ketchup to dip it in which is fine, but I think they strategically use that so the heat of the ketchup masks the lack of flavor. After all this we got a box for the rest of the Mac bites and asked for the check.

Came here late evening after a Metro show and I gotta admit I will come back for the burgers, nice selection of beers, reasonable prices, as well as the warm and inviting relaxed environment. The place was not empty but not jammed.  (Not sure what it's like on Cubs game days but likely will never know since I'm a Whitesox fan :) ). The Farmhouse Burger paired with the Kentucky Bourban Barrel Ale was a perfect match. The cook clearly understood what medium means and the endless toppings, capped off with a sunny side up egg, makes my mouth water today. Curly fries were the perfect complement seasoned with pepper. My only slight disapointment is that the sunny side up egg, which closed the deal for me in terms of what to order, was overcooked so no runny yoke to baste the otherwise mouthwatering creation but the thick cut bacon eased my disapointment. Overdone egg was not a deal breaker, but I may send it back next time especially seeing some customer pics of a perfect presentation. The service was competent and friendly. I definitely recommend this place though.",0.9951,0.672,0.29,0.038,0.5885912698412697

Boring as we were, most of us had sodas, but one of us did have a Mimosa. They have a fantastic Bloody Mary bar. While I did not order one, I should have. Our meals were outstanding. I had the Farmhouse Burger - 1/2 pound of meat topped with pulled pork, bacon and a fried egg. All of this plus curly fries. Too much meat, but oh so good. At our table we also had a Motherclucker, a Buffalo Chicken wrap and a Truffle Mushroom Burger. We also sampled the Truffle Fries, which were outstanding. Garlicky, oily and generally great.

The place probably has a new chef because the menu was totally changed. There were great vegetarian options before with chickpea and black bean burgers, but both great choices are gone. The new vegetarian alternative is a BALSAMIC GRILLED PORTOBELLO  MUSHROOM, which was just awful! First of all, it did not come in a burger bun, although the menu didn't say anything about it. It was instead in a really white, kinda toasted white roll... with some tomato-bell pepper mix on the top, covered with some non-tasty sauce, which made it impossible to eat it normally. I was eating it with knife and fork! The mushroom was not portobello either, it was more a regular bigger mushroom, which was still ridiculously small on the roll  bun. The mushroom was so terrible salty that I was not able to eat it! Terrible, terrible burger! My husband's choice was not better either. He ordered the BACON GRILLED CHEESE PATTY MELT, which is a sandwich!So don't put it below the Burger label! It's ok for a brunch, but not for $16!

2015-09-22,2.0,"Went here last weekend for the Michigan-UNLV game and I gotta say, there are a few issues with Rockit if it is in fact a Michigan bar.  First off, the game was only on select TVs (downstairs). We were seated before the game started and just assumed it would be on all the TVs after kickoff. Nope. We had to make a special request to get the game on the TV closest to us. A British-sounding man with an ear piece, who I can only assume was a manager of sorts, would not put the sound on. Instead they favored us with some nifty club music. Who the hell wants to hear that at 11 a.m.? When we made one last plea -- much to the annoyance of our waitress -- she told us if we wanted to hear the game we had to go upstairs. What? So, what you're saying is only the upstairs is actually a Michigan bar? Garbage.  The second strike against this place is that they actually RAISE the prices of their specials on game days. The fancy Bloody Mary bar listed at $7 is actually $9. Same goes for all the specials. It's like some kind of reverse-special. I have only heard about places that raise their prices on game day in the first segment of Bar Rescue. I didn't think it was a thing people actually did in real life.  Given the abundance and diversity of Michigan bars in Chicago (Matilda's, Diag, West End, Duffy's, Newport Bar & Grill, and Mullen's, just to name a few), you'd think they wouldn't gouge the fan base and alumni. Rockit is a bit on the pricey side, but given its Wrigleyville location, I suppose that's to be expected.  I will give credit where it's due, the breakfast burrito I got was good. For $12 it should be. Alas, one burrito is not enough to bring me back to this place.",0.7586,0.91,0.054,0.037,0.4424710424710425

This year, they only have the game on upstairs.  I sat downstairs and had to ask them to turn the Michigan game on.  I was then told on game days the regular priced drinks are $2 more than the menu price.  Yes.  Not only are there NO game day discounts- they raise the price.  After asking to turn the Michigan game on... I asked to turn on the sound.  They were playing club music at an 11AM game.  After an irritated waitress told me to wait... a man came over to me with a headset and British accent and told me we had to go upstairs if we wanted the game with sound.  They have a DJ up there too.  WHAT?!  I am already seated in the bar with my drink and can't even get the sound for the game?  The game that wasn't even on the TV to begin with.  NO.   Sorry Rockit.  Overpriced.  No game sound, no cheering.  Overpriced average food.  Go to Diag, Matilda's, Duffy's... any Michigan bar is better than this place.",-0.9207,0.842,0.053,0.105,0.42828784119106716

For dinner, I had the Mac Attack burger.  The Mac Attack burger is certainly a must-try.  But where they earned points for creativity and deliciously fried macaroni and cheese, they lost points for the hamburger patty, which was relatively thin and not particularly full of flavor.  Overall, I'd say it was tasty though. Overall, for 2 drinks and the burger, my bill was around $35.  The staff was very friendly, and the bar is located near the Wrigley Field, so it's convenient if you want to grab a few drinks and food before a game.  I'd recommend this restaurant to friends to give it a try.",0.9353,0.734,0.163,0.103,0.535472739820566

It wasn't busy and they were able to sit us in a booth by the window which was pretty cool as we enjoy people watching.  We had a server with a server in training both were pretty knowledgeable and friendly. When I checked in on Yelp, we scored a free appetizer of onion rings. I would get the onion rings again and pay for it. We both liked it a lot the batter was not too thick and the onion rings were sweet and it came with a side of dipping sauce. I ordered the Mac attack burger which seriously was two hockey puck size deep-fried mac & cheese with a small size burger patty, lettuce and a tomato. I didn't care much for this burger because I couldn't eat the two Mac caddies with the meat so I ended up using my utensils to eat my burger. A side salad was ok it had attend the vinaigrette dressing. You didn't have a choice of dressing. I wish that Patty was thicker and Mack and cheese a little thinner. I plan to order something different next time. Hubby got the hallway of all Ranchero burger that came with seasoned curly fries. Is burger was pretty good nice thick caddy cooked slightly pink in the middle with an egg on top and us with a kick to it. It was plenty of seasoned curly fries hot and crispy was pretty good. He said he would order that again. The beer menu was a pretty nice size, I like my angry orchard cider it was nice and cold. And hubby likes his beer too. We didn't want dessert however we were persuaded I'm getting a milkshake I ended up getting the Oreo milkshake to go it was pretty typical nothing too fancy to talk about it.

I didn't have high expectations, but I was blown away with the customer service and atmosphere of the restaurant. Our servers name was Ryan, he did an excellent job! He was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. I ordered a beer and the BBQ Pork Nachos which were decent. My friend ordered Southwest Chop Salad... WHAT A PORTION! The salad was huge, definitely worth the price. During our meal the GM Dan came outside, introduced himself, and ask us how we were enjoying our meal. We ended up chatting with him for a few minutes about the construction at Wrigley Field and development of the community. Overall the customer service would definitely be the reason for my return.

I love TOTS!  Their beer list is decent which is good for a beer lover like myself.  Our waitress was bad. There's no other way of putting it. She had no clue what was going on.

Since we had a large group, they wouldn't seat us until at least half of our group was there. We mainly came here to use a Groupon we had. It was $26 for two burgers and two flights of beer or whiskey. Tough to beat that deal. On top of that, Rockit was pretty cool and allowed us to use multiple Groupons for the same table. On top of that, they included a $10 gift card for each of us when they brought out our bill.

Breaded Mac and Cheese bites - The name says it all. They had a good crunchy outside and was still melty on the inside, and they came with a spicy sriracha ketchup. Solid start to the meal. Locavore Burger - I got this burger because it seemed pretty unique to Chicago. It's made up of ingredients local to the midwest. It had Goose Island beer battered onion rings, Nordic Creamery cheese, and Nueske bacon aioli. Usually with beer battered food I can't really taste the beer, but the flavor of the Goose Island beer definitely came through in these onion rings. The burger itself was really juicy and the cheese+bacon+fried onion combo delivers once again. I should've thought to throw an egg on top of it to really step up the flavor.

I tried the truffle mushroom turkey burger (mushrooms, gruyere cheese, sautéed mushrooms, truffle crème fraiche, served with truffle fries).

My friend had the truffle burger, which he said was good, and I had the famous mac and cheese burger, which holds the contents of a fairly normal burger within two ""buns"" made of breaded/friend mac and cheese. It was really delicious, but I knew as soon as I picked it up that it was going to be impossible to eat like a regular burger. It was too hot, too tall, and the mac and cheese buns were immediately breaking apart. There's no 'squishing' this burger together, there's no holding it without getting yourself really greasy. So I ate it with a knife and fork, just slicing it all up into a casserole kind of dish. It was really good, as were their seasoned curly fries, but the novelty of the special burger wore off pretty quickly when I realized it was more of a cool gimmick than really practical.

If every business had staff as amazing as Jessie the bartender or Mike the Operations Manager, the world would be a much better place!

I did manage to eat a few jalapeno poppers - I could eat them for the rest of my life. They were THAT good. I also sampled some of Rockit Burger Bar's food on my first venture there for the preview night and I could have literally ate till I died and went to heaven.

2014-12-18,4.0,"I have always liked the Rockit franchise and this Lakeview version of Rockit is no exception. I have been here twice now, on two groupons, for brunch and dinner.  The brunch deal gave us two bloody marys and two entrees. We ordered our bloody marys and were told to help ourselves at the bloody mary bar. Not knowing how the procedure worked, we thought it best to just bring our small plates over, rather than our filled to the top drinks. We chose one of a lot of things to try and as we were walking away, the bartender asked us if we had even ordered the bloody marys! We responded that yes indeed we had, but I was super embarrassed about the situation- were we only allowed to take 3 items? Should we have had our beverages with us? He made me feel like a thief. Not the best way to treat your customers to save a few pieces of cheese and pickles from getting taken. So, the $5 bloody mary bar is awesome, but remember to take your drink with you. As it was a burger bar, for my entree I ordered the breakfast burger and it was cooked properly and had amazing flavor. Really enjoyed it. Our waiter was great too, and overall our experience was enjoyable, even with the bartender nearly spoiling my happy brunch feeling. For dinner, the groupon deal offered two craft beers and two burgers. Perfection. The beer list is extensive and I happily perused it and settled on the Trumer pilsner which comes in a tall branded glass. Nice touch. For my burger, I opted for the Locavore which comes topped with onion rings, and seasoned curly fries. The food came out super fast, which was so great because I was so hungry. The curly fries sadly did not live up to expectation as they were a bit too crunchy. The seasoning was right on, but I like a bit of crunch and then some squishiness rather than eating curly stringy potato chips. The burger, however, was again properly cooked and had an awesome flavor. I devoured the entire thing. Our waitress was super nice and attentive and without any snarky comments coming our way from anyone else, I had a much better experience. Plus, I love the decor and comfortable squishy booths. The only part of the decor that was unexpected but I suppose added to the rustic feel of the bar was a mouse scurrying about. Kid you not. My friend saw it first and I didn't believe him, but then I saw it! I alerted our server to his presence even though I felt bad about causing his impending death. I probably shouldn't still give this place 4 stars with a mouse in the house because that's kind of gross, but hey, it happens.",0.9981,0.711,0.214,0.076,0.6592509920634921

I can't remember for the life of me what was on it! However, I remember the fries pretty well.  My burger came with truffle fries, which were savory and delicious.  My husbands burger came with white cheddar fries which were really good too and had a slight kick to them.  The beer selection was pretty good as well.  Both beers I tried were delicious; I tried an oatmeal stout (bottle only) which was so good but so expensive at 10 or 11 bucks.  I found that you are hard pressed to find a beer anywhere in Chicago for under 7 bucks.  But still, over 10 bucks is a little much for me if I plan to have multiple beers ;) We also decided to get a little wild and have desert even though we were beyond stuffed after our burgers.  We enjoyed the desert nachos and rootbeer float.  The rootbeer float was not really any different than any other rootbeer float I have tried but very good.  The nachos were really good too, but I couldn't manage to eat more than one as I feared I might explode and die from over eating.  Great food, great deserts, great beer, you can't go wrong here.

The pizza crust was thin and about one inch of the outer crust was crispy, like a cracker. That was the best part. The tomato sauce was close to inedible; it's color was even 'off'. The vegetables they threw on top seemed to be soaked in hot water first and that's it. I didn't think it was possible to completely screw up tomato sauce and easily sautéed vegetables on top of a pizza crust. Congrats Rockit Burger Bar - you did it.

2014-08-22,4.0,"Brunch. It's a meal I enjoy on weekends but not nearly enough as I'd like. But I finally had a chance to enjoy an awesome brunch with my friend Melissa. It was a pretty special outing because it was also her birthday! So to celebrate, we enjoyed an amazing experience at Rockit Burger Bar. If you're a Chicago Cubs fan [The Baron], you'd appreciate this restaurant since it's located directed across the street from the famous Wrigley Field. This makes for great sidewalk eating to take in the vibe of Wrigleyville. So what can you expect at brunch from a burger bar? I was especially impressed with the delicious offerings... We left it to the expertise of Chef Amanda to show us how this burger bar does brunch... and they sure do it well. To start, we got settled in with some bubbly... mimosas! Chef Amanda kicked off our brunch with some variations to brunch favorites. She presented us with these lemon thyme waffles served with fresh whipped cream and berries. The lemon notes came through perfectly with hints of fresh thyme. It has a slightly savory flavor but it balanced well with the fresh berries. Another common breakfast item is oatmeal... however Chef Amanda's version was probably the best oatmeal I've ever had. This was a vegan version made with almond milk and topped with plump blueberries, bananas and toasted walnuts. As a palate cleanser, this crazy good bloody mary found it's way on our table. If you are a bloody mary fan, you need to come check this place out. Rockit Burger Bar has a great bloody mary bar where you can customize your drink. The one we enjoyed had a rim of really good spicy parmesan cheese that made it so good. {Note to self... try this at home!} Round two. Chef Amanda presented us with some of the best breakfast flatbread pizzas I've tasted. I especially liked the sausage and egg pizza. Breakfast sausage, fluffy scrambled eggs and a nice sprinkling of cheese topped this version, with a splash of color from green onions... Melissa enjoyed the mushroom and cheese... which was a nice balance of cheese, mushrooms and a touch of fresh thyme. And because this is a restaurant that specializes in burgers, how could we leave without having a taste? Chef Amanda presented us to two different burgers for round 3. Melissa, the fellow vegetarian/part time vegan, had Rockit's BBQ red bean burger. It's slightly sweet with a smoky flavor... For me, I got to get a sneak peak taste of the new breakfast burger that will be making it's way out on the menu. This is a bagel burger stuffed with thick sliced bacon, arugula, tomato and a perfect sunny side up egg... And since we were celebrating Melissa's birthday, she got the Rockit Rockstar treatment when she was surprised with dessert while enjoying a tomatillo bloody mary... For dessert, we dug into sopapillas, which are crisp tortillas sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and served with a healthy mound of vanilla ice cream. Light, sweet and a perfect ending to our meal... And if our amazing brunch wasn't enough, Melissa was spoiled with a card signed my the staff, filled with gift cards to some of the restaurants in the group including Sunda, Rockit Bar & Grill and Rockit Burger Bar.  If you're ever in Wrigleyville either as a local catching a game or even a visitor to check out the popular neighborhood of Wrigleyville, you must stop in at Rockit Burger Bar. They have an amazing brunch and their extensive menu for the rest of the day is just as outstanding! This was probably the most fun brunch I've been on, thanks to the wonderful staff of Rockit Burger Bar, the talented Chef Amanda and of course, the birthday girl herself who was great company.",0.9997,0.68,0.291,0.029,0.6567821067821066

2014-07-05,3.0,"My bud and I were looking for a place to see one of the World Cup soccer games, a place that would have a bit of atmosphere but would not be crazy crowded, and would have some decent food too.  Located across from Wrigley Field, Rockit Burger Bar filled the bill for us this afternoon.  There is a bar area with small tables and fairly comfy bar stools, a dining area in the back with some booths, and also an outdoor seating area beneath a big tree along Waveland.  We sat in the bar area, as we really wanted to see the game on one of the numerous screens.  There was some World Cup cred here, with country flags of some of the participating teams, player posters, t-shirts worn by the friendly staff, etc.   Since it was July 4th weekend and I would not be attending any barbeques (!!!), having a big beefy burger seemed like a very appropriate thing to do. I went with the Locavore burger, a local beef burger on a pretzel bun and topped with two onion rings, smoked cheese, bacon aioli, and coming with a side of fries.  The ensemble was fine if a bit dry, but I was hoping for a bit more flavorful oomph from my burger.  My bud ate the black angus burger, which comes with more typical toppings (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle) on a pretzel bun with fries.  The beer menu is extensive, and I was very happy with my tall cool glass of Weihenstephan in its appropriate glass (astoundingly the label says ""world's oldest brewery - since 1040"").  Since the match went into overtime, we then each indulged in a caramel banana milkshake, which was a sweet and tasty treat.

2014-07-05,2.0,"I tend to be really sympathetic to uber-hyped restaurants. The expectations can get ridiculous. That being said, Rockit Burger Bar committed a cardinal sin that even my sympathy can't excuse. When you go to a ""burger bar,"" you really expect to get your burger cooked properly. Both my husband's and my burgers were overcooked and took forever to be served (probably because they spent so much extra time on the grill!).  I love the restaurant's concept but being able to cook a medium-rare burger isn't exactly rocket science (see what I did there?). I expected more and was disappointed that the food not only failed to live up to the hype, it also failed to actually be cooked properly. For the time it took and the product I received, I could have easily just cooked in my backyard and had a much more enjoyable time. To sum up: Rockit Burger Bar provides a nice beer selection that is reasonably priced. They have a friendly staff but long wait times and an unfortunate and utterly inexcusable tendency to overcook their burgers. The hype is nice, but if they can't deliver a properly-cooked burger then they shouldn't call themselves a burger bar.",0.9682,0.778,0.159,0.063,0.5313218390804597

2014-04-24,1.0,"Thanks to Rockit Burger Bar, I can now say I have eaten the worst burger of my life. The service was awful. I can handle bad service if the food makes up for the difference, but here it most certainly did not. We ordered the Locavore and the Truffle Mushroom Burger (medium rare and rare, respectively) with curly fries and truffle fries.  The Locavore was cooked to well done and was like chewing on sawdust. It was cold, as though it had been cooked far too early, and the onion ring on it was pure grease. The bacon aioli it was said to have come with was nowhere in sight which was too bad as it may have added some much needed moisture. Perhaps the worst offense was the bun. It was cold to the touch, not toasted or warmed at all, and dense as can be. The curly fries it came with (which we had subbed for bad looking plain fries) were cold as well. And when I say cold I don't mean room temp, I mean cold and likely had sat in a fryer basket above the grease for 30 min before getting tossed in seasoning mix. The Truffle Mushroom Burger was so bland and under seasoned we could hardly believe they'd serve this (though that can be due to all the accompaniments that were blatantly left off in the kitchen). At least on this burger the bun was warmed up. The patty itself had no texture or flavor and both the gruyere cheese as well as the truffle creme fraiche that were meant to be on it were entirely left off (I don't mean scantily applied, I mean they were not there at all). The truffle fries were fine. We would have made these issues known to our server rather than bitching on Yelp but the only time he asked how the food was came about 30 seconds after getting the burgers. At that point the true sadness of the state of these burgers had yet to be known. Overall, I can not think of a worse meal we have had in recent history.

2014-01-25,4.0,"This is the burger joint I've been looking for all my life!  I've only started eating here recently, and have loved everything I've eaten, burger or otherwise.  The sauces (jalapeno aioli, sriracha ketchup, apricot raisin chutney, ghost pepper aioli and chipotle mayo) play a great part in making these burgers so special.  The curly fries are crisp and perfectly seasoned.   Among the non-burger deliciousness, I dig the turkey chili, the buffalo chicken mac and cheese, and the braised beef short rib mac and cheese.  Of course, the first thing I tried here was the Mac Attack burger.  The hamburger patty was thin, which was a good thing given the thickness of the mac and cheese buns; if the patty was any thicker, I might have dislocated a jaw trying to eat that thing!  The sriracha ketchup gave it a great flavor.  In trying to eat the burger with my hands, I soon found the mac and cheese bun starting to disintegrate and the burger falling apart, necessitating the use of the fork and knife.  I had been advised by Yelp friend Anthony M to allow the mac and cheese bun to cool off, which would make it firmer and more conducive to eating with my hands.  Of course, as soon as the burger arrived in front of me, I forgot all about the advice and proceeded to devour it! Oh, and Thursday nights are trivia night, and Tuesday night is comedy night!  Way to enjoy more than burgers!

I got the Truffle Mushroom burger, and it was one of the best things I did all week. I know that people either love or hate truffle oil, but I think if it's going to be anywhere it should mixed into creme fraich  atop a mound of angus with mushrooms and cheese. It was super hearty and flavorful, but not overwhelming. I remember thinking that I was going to try to have some self control with my portions and eat half then and save half for later ... NOPE! I was with a few people and it's usually customary for everyone to offer each other a taste of their meal. Not this girl, not this time. If they tried to reach their hand over they would have pulled back a nub. I also love their bloody mary bar. I've experienced it a few times and the variety they have there is impressive.

2014-01-19,4.0,"I first heard of Rockit because my girlfriend was scrolling through some of Chicago's unique must try foods and stumbled across the mac attack: a cheeseburger using two fried mac and cheese patties as buns. Well we purchased tickets to an IO show and realized that rock it was right around the corner. Sadly when we were seated at the restaurant, none of us were feeling gluttonous enough to take down the fried and cheesy monster. Instead my girlfriend ordered the truffle burger and I ordered the motherclucker.  My chicken sandwich had a nice soft pretzel bun with huge strips of bacon and cheddar, while slathered in bbq sauce. It was pretty much everything I expected out of a good chicken sandwich and my plate came loaded with fries. My girlfriend's truffle burger was pretty good and the truffle flavor shined in the burger. However, I've had MUCH better truffle fries elsewhere. I'm not sure what the other restaurants did to make it taste better, but these ones just seemed like their regular fries tossed in a small amount of truffle oil and served (kinda boring). Fry quality was pretty solid though- slightly salty and a nice soft texture. This place gets 3.5 stars for food but I really enjoyed the atmosphere here. The restaurant had a wood interior that added to the warmth and coziness of the comfort food served. The service here was super attentive and the TVs were nice and large to catch the game. While dining I noticed that though it's a sports bar, it was decently intimate given how much space there is between tables.

2013-12-17,4.0,"My boyfriend and I were on the hunt for a trivia night last Thursday, and I'm so glad we chose the one at Rockit!  The only thing we didn't like was that we didn't win.  I blame it on the fact that 1/2 of us was not American.  If only they had questions about English Premier League football or European history....but I digress. We came in around 630, and the trivia didn't start until 8.  The place was actually pretty empty, lots of available tables, and we were a little concerned that there'd only be like two trivia tables (fear not!  Ten more groups showed up in short order).  They had 1/2 off bottles of wine on Thursdays so we snagged one of those (and by we I mean I, since my boyfriend mostly had beer) and we got some chicken wings, and the super swanky sounding Rockit Burger with kobe beef, brie, fried shallot, mejdool date aioli served alongside truffle fries.  And we split a chopped salad which was humongous. Chicken wings were great.  The boubon maple ones at the downtown Rockit are even better but for classic buffalo wings these are pretty great.  Very hot and crispy and tender and juicy.  Then the burger came out to greet us, we cut it in half, and oh maaaaaah goodness.  That burger!  It is $19 which is completely insane but the quality and flavor of the meat was stunning.  Oh THIS is why people make a big deal about kobe beef!  So juicy and perfectly cooked, and full of savory, meaty flavor.  The toppings were great as well, but that burger....as Guy Fieri would say (lord help me), ""You can put that on a flip flop and I'd eat it.""  Truffle fries were wonderful and I can't believe we didn't finish them but we got too full - they had such an earthy truffle flavor.  The salad was light and crisp and sweet because it's full of apples and grapes!  A great side dish to cut through a heavy meal, and there aren't many light options here! Trivia was really well-organized and fun, with questions on a variety of topics.  They post the questions on the TV screens which is great, so you can stare at them while you think and don't have to scribble them down or ask for a repeat.  It is certainly challenging but accessible - we were doing relatively well in round 1, but then struggled in round 2 and alas we did not gain the victory.  But it was a really fun night and I'd go back here for trivia anytime!",0.9967,0.765,0.178,0.057,0.5576267056530213

This essentially limited our choices to three burgers: Vegetarian, Turkey, and Black Angus.

He then explained that it was $11 per burger because I paid a total of $22 and that the offer only gives me two free beers.

I had been raving about the Bloody Mary bar and how good the Cinnamon Raisin Grilled Cheese was. Well, for starters, they do not have the same menu and this item was not on there. Strike 1 because I was craving it! That was a huge bummer but decided to get over it and get a burger. I ordered my usual Blood Mary with gin and was told it would be regular price (not $5) if I wanted gin. Weird, I do at the Hubbard location for $5 but whatever, I got the vodka. Strike 2 was the Bloody Mary bar I found inside. It was pitiful. I think if you have 2 Rockit locations, even if they are slightly different names, this bar should be pretty much the same thing. Sure, it's in Wrigley but that's no excuse. As a vegetarian, I chose the Turkey Burger but substituted the red bean burger. It was great, as was my boyfriends The Hottie. Fries all around were good as usual.  Now for the service. I hope our server was just having a bad day or something because she was just the worst. First, when we asked to move to a sunnier table after about 20 minutes, she responded with. ""Yeah, sure, whatever"" and did not help us move our stuff. I mean, who says that?! She was also slow to do EVERYTHING. When our food arrived, which was delivered by someone else, we needed a few condiments and had to wait about 5 minutes before she came out and asked if we needed anything. We also needed refills on beverages and had empty water glasses (it was a hot day). We had 2 friends join us for drinks and when they arrived, it took about 5 minutes to come over. Mind you there was no game going on and the patio had about 3 other tables, only 1 of which was hers. When they decided to order a burger themselves she was nowhere to be found. Our friend went inside to find her and ask if she could order the Hottie burger and got ""I'll be right out to take your order"". This was Strike 3. It was literally just the Hottie burger with fries, nothing else, no substitutes. Having been in the service industry for years, I was simply disappointed. I don't know the server's name because she never told us what it was.  Overall, we enjoyed the food and the mojitos that took too long to come out, but the experience was not good.

Their sweet potato fries are the perfect side dish or shareable appetizer: they come covered in brown sugar crumble and served with a delectable chipotle mayo. Flat bread pizza = HUGE THUMBS DOWN (the crust came soggy and almost non-exsistent, and the pizza itself was all cheese, hardly any sauce or toppings). The atmosphere is your typical burger-bar-Wrigleyville-sportshub. The bar's walls are mounted with large-screen TV's making it the perfect atmosphere to watch any sporting event in.  Per usual with all bars in Wrigleyville, you've got to beware when the Cubs are playing: they do not honor their advertised specials on game days. I went with my roommate after getting an email advertizing $5 Maker's Mark, margaritas and mojitos to find that they weren't honoring any of these specials because the Cubs had a game earlier in the day (even though the game had been rained out and the email sent the night before).

2013-04-07,3.0,"To be honest - as the burger bar concept trends up - everyone with a frying pan and a hunk of meat is going to update their shingle.  This is good news for chunky-monkeys (like me). This is bad for burger lovers with discerning taste (like me). I had heard and read mostly bad about ROCKIT. Considering the neighborhood -I wasn't expecting much. You have to try for yourself - you never know. Everyone deserves one chance.   I met my friend there and we were given rockstar seating - good start. Let me say - with no hint of sarcasm - the service was pretty impressive. We were greeted by two Lincoln Park Trixies (Kiley and Haley - honestly) and I thought we were in for a sit-com set up - at least an Alan Funt moment (Kids - Google Alan Funt!)  They were quick and on the money (for the most part). The joint was packed and there was live trivia going on and they were still able to deftly move between the tables and take care of business. Now my friend ordered a chicken sandwich with avocado. Like most restaurants - there is an upcharge for avocado. UNLIKE most restaurants they give you 3/4 of a perfectly ripened avocado. Nice work. I ordered a MacDaddy which was supposed be a burger with brisket and mac-n-cheese on it. I should have gone with the chicken sandwich.  I will say this slowly for the burger bar owners/attendees who might be reading; If you call it a burger bar - your burger has to be AT THE VERY LEAST  present. That burger was not much bigger than a White Castle Honey Puck. As far as the brisket - i think they may have made some brisket-flavored spread and run the knife over the bread. You could almost taste it, but you couldn't see it.  As for the ""Mac"" part of the MacDaddy, they took a handful of pasta in cheese sauce and threw it on top of the mini-patty. Let me be clear. This was not mac-n-cheese. This was pasta in cheese sauce - not the same thing. Everyone wants to be Kuma's Corner - the difference is the good people at Kuma's are innovators who are having a ball making awesomeness on a plate. Their Zen approach - and their willingness to have fun with what they do - will keep them head and jalapeno above the pack.  Rockit is trying to capitalize on a trend - but they are not doing their homework. They are not making compelling burgers. They are surely not making legendary burgers.   $12.00 for a burger that doesn't deliver - even in that neighborhood - is unforgivable. Maybe they can get out once or twice a week and go to a real burger bar and take a lesson (steal an idea - whatever).",0.9842,0.88,0.099,0.021,0.58093567251462

I would have been upset if I had actually paid the $12 that each of these cost without a groupon.  I was a little peeved that a party of six that ordered after us got their food before us, but oh well. As for the meals, the burgers were tasty, and cooked perfectly to medium rare.

The environment is great and the service is truly top notch.  I've had a few things at Rockit Burger Bar including all of their amazing types of fries. I personally prefer the truffle fries, they are amazing with the bacon aioli. They're also very accommodating and willing to specify anything on a burger to what you'd like. I usually get the BBQ Bourbon Bacon Burger but I swap out the red onions for onion rings. Their burgers are always cooked perfectly and are ready surprisingly quick, even on busy days and holidays. They have some amazing and unique burgers to choose from along with tons of sides like sweet potato fries and amazing mac & cheese. You can even get a burger with mac & cheese on it! New Year's Eve was a different than normal experience of course but it was still every bit as great as any other time I've been to Burger Bar. There was a great DJ who played good music throughout the night. There were multiple bars so the line to get a drink was never more than a few people long. There was plenty of room to dance and definitely no shortage of food! There was everything from salad to mini burgers to chocolate covered strawberries. Definitely worth the price which, for NYE, wasn't even that much! I would come back again for NYE. However, I would bring a group. You can't get a table if you have fewer than 4 people and trust me, you'll want the seats after a few hours of dancing!

This past Friday night my parents make the trek from the suburbs to Wrigleyville to check out my new pad and we ended up at Rock It Burger Bar. We started off with drinks. My mom tried the white sangria and I opted for the bloody mary (it was on special). My mom really liked her sangria and I LOVED my bloody. It was made with Absolut Peppar and was deliciously spicy, I also appreciate good vodka in my $5 bloody!  My dad ordered a simple bacon cheddar burger with fries for his meal. My mom and I got more adventurous and decided to split the short rib macaroni and cheese and The Locavore burger with waffle fries. My dad thought his meal was fine, but nothing special. To quote: ""There's so many burger places these days, they're all starting to taste the same"". Fair enough.  On the other hand I was wild about my meal! The macaroni and cheese was literally the best I have ever had at a restaurant. The short ribs were perfectly cooked and the combo was amazing. I was so glad we tried it! The Locavore burger was perfectly cooked and I loved the combination of flavors. I was glad we were splitting it because I easily could have eaten the entire thing! The waffle fries were nothing special at all but the ranch dressing I requested on the side was scrumptious, definitely homemade!

2013-02-12,5.0,"THERE'S MORE THAN MEAT IN BETWEEN THE BUNS! When we first visited Rockit it was a beautiful sunny day in July and we decided to sit on the patio.  Will was our waiter and he was really helpful, cool and fun to talk too.  I looked over the menu and I could not decide which burger to get.  I finally decided to go big and choose the Rockit Burger.  It is made with Kobe beef, melted brie, fried shallots & medjool date aioli on a red onion brioche bun & served with truffle fries.  I took one bite and I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  How could something taste this good between two buns?  All of the flavors just worked perfectly and it reminded me of biting into the most delicious piece of butter.  It was so rich and delicious tasting.  I was instantly in love.  The truffle fries were also really good too.  We sat back in the sun and thought...""Where have you been Rockit my whole life?"" Here is what I love about this place. The outdoor patio is within eye & ear shot of Wrigley Field. It is so much fun to sit outside and listen to the organ music or the crowds cheering during the game. This place is a step up from all of the other dives around Wrigley that are serving up frozen burgers and boiled hot dogs.  I used to go to these places because all I had to do was buy a drink and I got a free hot dog. I really feel like I have graduated from those places and Rockit Burger Bar is my graduate class in Wrigley Field eating. I highly recommend to hit this place before or after a ball game. It is even fun on a cold winter night, after skating across the street. So after my first visit I planned my next move. What would be my next burger? How would I choose? I had read in the newspaper that Rockit had just won Best Burger for its Farmhouse Burger and I thought that I am ready to conquer it.  Again I visited Rockit and sat outside listening to the noises of Wrigley.  I put my order in for the Farmhouse, which is a black Angus patty, BBQ pulled pork, fried egg, & applewood smoked bacon. Wow! The burger was not only beautiful to look at, but it was also delicious to eat. Everything on the bun was so earthy and the flavors again exploded with every bite.  At this time I decided that I must try every burger on the Rockit menu and my Quest began. Like Frodo (total Geek reference) I journeyed through the menu trying every burger along the way.  Sometimes on my quest I had my wife or daughter or a friend to travel with me and the adventure was always amazing.  I must take this time to talk about something other then burgers.  The Mac and Cheese here is out of this world.  My little one just loves it. She looks at me with cheese on her face and says. ""Daddy I just can't stop eating it because it is that good!""  Speaking of kids this place is very kid friendly.  The staff is just amazing with my little one and she might love this place more then me. They also have a great kids menu too. Now back to my Burger Quest. It is a long journey but someone has to do it. One of my new favorite burgers here is the turkey burger. I recently discovered this during Thanksgiving when they had a special holiday burger with sage stuffing, gravy and cranberry jelly on it.  This was one of the most amazing turkey burgers I have ever had in my life. It was so good that I thought I would rather serve this to my family on Thanksgiving instead of a whole dry turkey.  The turkey patty here has so much flavor. I understand that this is a brand new recipe and it is so good. I also recently tried the regular turkey burger, which has avocado, chipotle mayo, lettuce, tomato & onion on a pretzel bun. The meat is so tender this may be my new favorite burger here.  But every time I say that I have different burger here and I am in love with a new one.  It is so hard to stay committed here. Recently the Rockit Burger Bar started doing a #BurgerLab on Saturday nights at 7pm. This is so cool because it allows you to put together your own burger with exotic meats & incredible unique toppings. No other burger place in Chicago is doing such a creative approach to building burgers. This kind of reminds me of what Hot Doug's did for Hot Dogs in Chicago. So if you are looking to be creative, you can build your own or let the staff build one for you.  A few weeks ago I had the Grilled Bison Burger which was called the Lean & Mean and it was topped with house-made apple ginger kimchee! I have never had bison meat before but I can tell you that I am in love with it now. I have even told the staff & chef here I wish that this burger would become a regular on the menu. I am keeping my fingers crossed that this happens. I highly recommend on a Saturday night you check out this fun creative way to build your own burger. All of the burgers here are so good and it is more then just meat on a bun. The staff and management rock here too. Special thanks to Josh, Dan, Thomas, Kylie, Jessica & Will. Thanks for always making my visits special here.  Next Burger? TBD",0.9996,0.801,0.19,0.009,0.5539667957828337
2013-02-11,3.0,"After walking by Rockit hundreds of times over the last few years when I lived two blocks away, it took me moving away and buying a Groupon to get me through the doors. That alone should illustrate that this is one of those places that should be simply walked by, as there are many other burger options in the city that have a better taste for the price tag.  The Groupon I purchased was $24 for two burgers and two Whiskey flights, so my boyfriend and I decided to make a date night out of it. We arrived around 6:30pm on a Saturday night to a pretty tame crowd and we were promptly seated. Our waitress didn't bat an eye when we showed her the Groupon, and quickly brought out our Whiskey flight selection. We both opted for their Rye option, which was delicious. After a few minutes our waitress came back and took our order, and our food came out maybe 15 minutes or so after that. The turnaround was incredibly fast, which we appreciated as our appetites had been whet by our whiskey flight. I decided to go with the Johnny Apple Burger which consisted of a black angus patty, applewood smoked bacon, brie, gala apple, pecan aioli, and a side of sweet potato fries. I ordered this medium and it definitely came out as a grey, tasteless, well done that was oddly spotted with dime sized pink areas throughout. I'm not for sure how this was cooked on the grill, but the doneness of the meat was incredibly puzzling. I didn't mention this to the waitress as she only came back after our first bite, so I wasn't aware of the state of the burger. The toppings were a tad on the disappointing side--the gala apple didn't have much of the sweetness to be cut by the bacon and brie. The pecan aioli was missing in flavor. The only aspect I really appreciated were the two thick cut pieces of bacon that were cooked to a crunchy, yet soft, perfection. The sweet potato fries were sadly sprinkled with a diabetic-shock-inducing amount of sugar that wasn't needed in the slightest.  My boyfriend opted for the Bourbon BBQ burger which was cooked closer to a medium-well after he ordered it medium. I snagged a bite and couldn't taste the bacon aioli or the blue cheese, and pretty much just got a mouthful of BBQ sauce and meat. On both burgers the bun to burger ratio was skewed in favor of the bun, which I don't personally care for. For $12 a burger, I'd much rather go to DMK for the area or make the trek to Kumas for a larger burger with toppings that actually have flavor.",0.9496,0.863,0.086,0.051,0.43827980804725

I am pretty sure there was only one waitress working the back room, but she did a hell of a job taking care of everyone even when it got packed.  Thank the lord for their bloody mary bar! Not even one bloody was enough for me. Though I really missed the cheese that they have the Rockit in River North (sorry but I LOVE cheese!)

2012-12-21,4.0,"With so many burger places popping up around Chicago, Rockit Burger Bar in the Lakeview/Wrigleyville area has plenty of competition.  They also focus on offering high quality burgers with some outrageous toppings.  However, unlike the other places I have been to (like 25 degrees or The Burger Point), they offer seasonal specials which take advantage of current trends and keeps everyone's tastebuds at bay.  For instance, eggnog milkshakes and a jingle bell themed burger... it just screams holidays.  Anyway, the overall food portion is solid, the cost is considered average for most of the burger places in the city, the waitresses were very friendly, but the atmosphere was a little on the lacking side.  Being more of a bar, the dining area was pretty dimly lit--almost too much for my liking.  One main improvement could involve being a little more generous with the toppings.  I personally like extra toppings and an extra juicy burger so the minimal amounts (yet great balance of each ingredient) caused a minor knock on my overall rating.  I went ahead and gave it 4 miles overall with room for improvement once I come back and try some of their other burgers!",0.987,0.812,0.171,0.017,0.3901190476190476

He ordered the Rock it burger. $19 for a Kobe beef patty with brie, shallots and date aioli with a side of truffle fries. Medium rare.  I ordered the Locavore. $14 for abeef patty with onions rings, bacon aioli and smoked cheddar. I opted for the waffle fries. Medium rare We also ordered 2 Goose Island Green Lines' each.  The Rockit Burger was dry, over-cooked and really didn't have any pronounced flavors. Icould only taste the aioli  when I took a bite of the bun by itself. The fries were good, but a little undercooked and some of them were borderline soggy.  The Locavore was a good, solid burger. I liked the bacon aioli. The fries were good as well, but they looked like they were the frozen kind you can get a jewel.

2012-04-25,4.0,"The Rockit is right across from Wrigley field and a great place to grab a bite before or after a game. They even have a nice outdoor patio for those sunny summer days.  However, if you are there on a game day, get there early or be prepared to wait. This place gets packed! I like their jalapeno poppers with jalapeno aioli dipping sauce. I know it sounds hot, but it's not hot at all. It has just a slight kick to it. Not enough to ever burn, and just enough to appeal to the masses that visit there.  The buffalo mac-n-cheese was good enough that my husband wanted to take home what we didn't eat.  I had the angus burger with brie, apples and bacon. The slices or bacon were crisp and thick cut. And the burger was good. Not fantastic, but fine for Chicago. For some reason, we have noticed that Chicago does a great job with pizza and hot dogs, but burgers are not as good as some other places in the country. I mention this only to prep the expectations of beef eaters from other parts yonder. So while, the burgers at Rockit may not be as great as a burger at a good burger joint in Texas might be, they are decent for what you will get in Chicago.  The sweet potato fries, though, were awesome! They dust them with brown sugar, making them a sweet and crunchy treat. I actually liked these much better than the burger.  We stuck with beer. This is one of the few places near us that we know serves Sol, which we like better than Corona, so we get our Sol fix here while chomping those burgers. The service here is very good. The waitress was attentive without being overbearing. She stopped by enough to make sure we had the drinks we needed but not often to interrupt our conversation. Also, the waitress was kind enough to give us a coupon for a free basket of curley fries for our table.

Perfect! There was PLENTY of room inside AND out, even better!  We opted to sit outside because it's finally turned nice enough where you can actually enjoy sitting outside. We decided to start the lovely evening with a draft beer (although it was 1/2 price bottles of wine -Thursday).  The beer was brought out and it was kind of warm.  Whatever, I'm not picky so we moved on from it and of course I drank it because I was still so excited to be sitting outside with a nice breeze!

The story is actually pretty hilarious, in retrospect.  My buddy and I went on an afternoon for some lunch.  I ordered a turkey burger, and she ordered a cheeseburger. My buddy asked the waitress if she could get some tobasco sauce for her burger.  So the waitress brings out a little side barbeque sauce in a container.  My buddy was like ""this isn't tobasco-- this is bbq""-- I tasted it and agreed-- and the waitress started arguing with us about what type of sauce it was!! LOL, it was sooo weird! We said it was prob just a misunderstanding and the cook put in BBQ, and if we could just have a bottle of tobasco.  She said ok. 15 minutes later, we had no tobasco.  My buddy was mid-way through her burger, so she asked one of the nice busboys to get us some. The busboy was walking toward our table with the tobasco... but here's the CRAZY part (I am NOT exaggerating or joking about this)... the waitress STOPS him on his way over to deliver the tobasco, scolds him, and sends him back to the kitchen!!!  It was in the shadows, but I did take notice, just cuz my buddy and I were watching for the mysterious and oh-so-elusive tobasco.   I motioned the waitress to come over, and asked her point blank ""What is your issue with giving us tobasco?""  She said that her manager frowns upon giving full cans at a table. Rockit, are you REALLY that cheap? As for MY turkey burger... it was burned.  The description sounded so good, the final product was not, and it was a huge disappointment.  Spent around 10 bucks on a burger that was inedible.  And I was too put off with the weird waitress to request a new one.  Figured it'd be easier to pay the check, leave, and never ever set foot in there again, which is exactly what happened. F- to Rockit in Wrigley.  SUPER F- to the waitress.  I left her a 25 cent tip, but gave the nice busboy that at least TRIED to provide some service 10 bucks.  If you wanna go say hi to the nice, hard-working busboys and give them some charity money for dealing with condescending, lame waitresses, then do it.  But if you're looking for a good place to hang out and eat some food, stay away at all costs. (PS- We never did get our tobasco.  But I guarantee you if we did, we would've grabbed it and made a clean getaway from the place, just to affirm that waitress's worst fears that we'd take away her precious tobasco... lol!  Tobasco = the holy grail of Rockit)",0.9876,0.791,0.135,0.074,0.6306060606060606

2011-07-05,4.0,"A conservative review from a not so conservative reviewer: I was here a few weeks back for a work event so this review is going to be a little limited due to my limited experience with the service (it was buffet style) and the food (pre chosen by some HR guru). Also, you will find no reference of the bar/drinks because even though I was hankering for a nice Arnold Palmer on that 90 degree day, this was a dry event. The servers were mingling right away when we arrived with veg & non-veg pizza appetizers. I snatched up a much needed piece of Mushroom pizza and it was delicious.  Next cam the truffle fries and sweet potato fries.   As a virgin to the truffle fry experience, I was eager to pop one in my mouth! I did so, burning my tongue (the price we foodies often pay), and was so delighted--they were so delicious!  I  consider sweet potato fries to be the new sundried tomatoes--everyone's doing them and no one's doing it right.  However, Rockit got it right!  They paired with an awesome dip, which complimented the sweetness so well. For dinner there was an array of mini slider burders, salad, and macaroni and cheese. The salad was perfect for summer  and not overdressed (a huge pet peeve with buffet-style, premade salads).  The mac was cheesey (as it should be) and I did not grab any sliders but everyone said they were great. Overall, I would love to come back for dinner with friends (not on a game day since it would probably crazy due to the very close proximity to Wrigley).  It is in a convenient area, so close to the Addison red line stop and not far from some great bars!",0.9876,0.811,0.147,0.042,0.5124188311688312
2011-06-27,3.0,"Went here for late lunch - live close by, needed food, and pride parade was just ending. Hubby got the veggie red bean burger, I got the turkey burger. He liked his, but said it was just a bit dry. Although he did say it's very hard to make such a veggie patty that stays together that isn't a little dry. But he liked it and would go back. My turkey burger was okay, it was moist, but nothing big on taste. The avocado and chipotle mayo that came on it was pretty good. Got the truffle fries, they were fine - could taste the truffle oil, but it wasn't over powering. If you love truffle oil, I'm guessing you'd enjoy this - I'm so-so about truffle oil, so they were just okay. Fries themselves were good, good amount of potato, I liked that. The beer we got could have been colder - that was a bummer since we had just been walking outside and really wanted that first sip of super cold refreshing beer. Their beer selection is decent, and cocktail selection is quite good.  Just fyi - they close pretty early on Sundays, at 5 p.m.,I think. There was a group that had come in from grayslake, supposedly just to eat there (we were close to host-station, so we could hear everything). They wouldn't let the group in or sit down because it was so close to closing. Thought that was a bummer for them, the group pleaded and begged, but the host wouldn't budge. So if you want to grab a bit - I""m guessing you have to be here 30+ min before closing? Felt bad for that group... I'd return here, again, since we live close. But probably wouldn't have a craving or NEED to go back. I do wish that all of their dishes that use cheese weren't so focused on brie. Brie on their Rockit burger, brie used on their cheeses fries. I'm really not a fan of brie, but that's me personally and I haven't tried theirs.

Pure and simply, they treat me like family. I have brought clients, I have brought pals from out of town, I have brought my daughter and a bunch of her friends, I have brought my 79 year old Aunt. No matter who I bring, they seem to be able to cater to them, where it is a bunch of friends looking to relive adolescence, a family Cubs outing or my 12 year old daughter and a bunch of her friends. I'm one of these people who are very loyal to people who treat me like family and that has been my experience with them..they treat me like family and make me feel welcome EVERYTIME I go there. It doesn't hurt that the staff has remained largely the same over the past few years (so they must be doing something right with their employees) and that their food is phenomenal.

2011-03-01,1.0,"I'm writing this review quite after the fact just b/c I was thinking about it the other day and figured I would join Yelp just to express how bad of an experience we had at this place. Our party of 3 came in when it was a busy afternoon.  Waited 10 min for a table (not a problem) and sat.  Were then asked to move to a different table since they were expecting a large party to come in soon and apparently hadn't planned their seating accordingly (again, not a problem.....we are 3 easy going 25 yr old males just wanting to watch some football). Larger party comes in and they apparently have trouble with the wait staff being able to walk b/w our table and the large party's.  This is where we start to have issues.  Our table is up against a wall, and therefore cant move.....they asked our friend to move to a different table adjacent to us.....a ridiculous idea ....Being highly intelligent ppl, we offered an alternative that the other table (not pushed up against a wall) move 6 inches to make room for the wait staff so that our friend could remain at our table (we would have simply left if not).  This is when the manager came and told us that we had to move our chairs and/or table (im not sure how he anticipated we would be able to do given that we were UP AGAINST A WALL). Luckily the other table overheard all of this craziness and said theyd be happy to move their table a few inches.  Problem solved. Outside of this one issue, the service was terrible.  Food was ok.  We had finished our lunch and were going to order some more food to snack on while watching the rest of the game, but the waitress basically came up to us and threw us our bill without even asking if we needed anything else. Only positive thing about this place is the fries.  Management clearly has no concept of proper logistical planning for large volume.  Wait service is bad (at best) and most of their menu looked over-priced given the quality of the food.

My mother ordered a salad and a the French Onion Soup, my dad got the Angus Burger, and I splurged a bit and got the Rockit Burger. All of our food came out nice and hot (a big deal in my family) and every single item was some of the best. I was a little worried about the price of the Rockit Burger with the truffle fries, but the burger was huge and the fries were plentiful. So was my dad's burger! While the food was on the expensive side, you do get alot of food! Everybody tried my truffle fries and they thought that it was the best item of the night! The only reason why I gave this less then five stars was that the service was a little slow, but it seemed that it was because there were very few servers.

2011-01-31,1.0,"I'm not one to write bad reviews or ridiculously long ones but this deserves both so bear with me. I hate to do so, especially given the circumstances that prompted my visit to Rockit but I can't help but give folks fair warning to visit at their own risk. I was recently contacted by their events coordinator (Manny) who wanted to work together to do some promotions and cross marketing. He was a great guy and our meeting went very well but before I jumped on board 100% it only made sense that I would actually check out the place in person since I'd never been inside.  On a Friday evening at about 7:00pm my bf and I walked in. The majority of the tables in the bar were empty but reserved which while odd didn't matter anyway since we were there to eat. The dinning room was also full but we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a nice big booth to clear, the hostess was also really sweet which was our one and only positive of the night. First off, the atmosphere was a bit of a conundrum. This place is billed as a ""rock bar"" however the front bar room was set up with turn tables and big screens with sports on. The dining room itself was all ambient and candle lit but again, big screens with sports all over the place. I guess this is great for the dudes that owe their girls a date night but don't want to miss the game?! Not exactly my scene. Second fail: menu. I am a vegetarian. Not a picky one mind you but I haven't eaten meat in 16 years and don't intend to. I live and eat in Chicago daily and never have a problem finding something to eat. Anywhere. I looked at Rockit's menu before hand just to be sure there would be something that constituted dinner (we had plans after and I was starving) and saw they had what looked like a delicious veggie burger which I was more than fine with. Upon ordering I find out that they discontinued their veggie burger over the summer. Why, at a restaurant in this location in the city would you discontinue the ONE dinner item on your menu without meat?! I ordered the over priced mac and cheese and sweet potato fries as a backup. Now, I will say the fries were DELICIOUS the perfect amount of crispy and sprinkled with brown sugar. NOM! (but they are FRIES! kinda hard to mess up) The mac and cheese on the other hand looked good but tasted like rubbery chalk. The noodles were over cooked and the cheese was more of a powder than a sauce. Blech. Oh and my bf's $19 burger arrived with a burned bun and missing half of the items it was supposed to include.  Third fail: Service nightmare. Our waitress took about 15 minutes to even take our drink order. Then came back out to the dining room no less than 5 times before actually bringing us our drinks. A runner brought our food out pretty quickly but again, our waitress was walking around the dining room plenty yet never came by to see how things were. My boyfriend had to flag her down to point out the mistake with his order and she just grabbed his plate and took it to the kitchen with no apology. She then brought the same plate back out with the new items and old everything else a few minutes later (gross) and then walked away without saying anything. We ate what little of our food we could stomach (both left well over half of what were served) and finished our one drink. A runner again came by and noticing we done grabbed our plates without even asking if we wanted to take home what were still full meals. After sitting there for another 10 minutes or so, still with no sign of our server we put our coats, gloves and scarves on only to have her come up a few minutes later to ask then if we wanted another drink. SERIOUSLY we had our coats on ready to leave. We of course said no and she flopped our check on the table (again no thanks or how was everything) and walked away. I was given a couple of gift cards to check out the place which I'd intended to share but after what we dealt with and our waitresses unwillingness to come back and even give us change without waiting another hour still hungry and drink less I left them on the table and we got out of there. So all in all the hostess was nice and the sweet potato fries were REALLY good but the inconsistent environment, ridiculous prices and AWFUL service mean I'll never step foot in there again.",0.9958,0.791,0.131,0.078,0.45368655692729776

Another person I was with that day already left a Yelp review about our experience, but I really feel the need to leave my own review as well. It was THAT bad. The short story is that the food was pretty good and there were some decent drink specials for the game. I will acknowledge that. But the staff was so rude I will never, ever go back. Which leads me to ... We had a smaller booth that could fit 6 people. As our group grew, we ended up with 7 people. We asked the waitress if we could put a chair at the end. She said no because of fire codes, so the extra person would have to stand. No problem. We were happy to have a table at all and decided to take turns standing. After the first quarter we noticed a large booth that sat 9 people, but only had 3 people. Thinking there would be no harm in asking if they would mind switching booths with us, one person in our group went over and politely asked them. They said sure. They had just ordered food but would let us know after. From there, we did not approach or bother them again. About 10 minutes later, the hostess tells us we have to cash out, leave our table and move into the bar area. We were being kicked out for asking the other group to switch with us. Which was weird since they were nice to us when we asked. The waitress promptly brings over our check, but we're still pretty surprised and confused by what's happening. Then the manager comes over. We ask what the problem is. He tells us we have too many people and we have to leave the table, even though we offer to break up into two groups and have some of us move into the bar area. He tells us the ""dining area"" is only for people eating and since we finished our meals we have to leave, which was weird since 98% of the other people in the ""dining area"" had also finished eating. Plus we wanted to order more food but our waitress was MIA. Then he tells us it was simply inexcusable to talk to another table. He is making no sense and clearly just wants us to leave. Point taken, we are ready to leave after such horrible service.  We pay our bill (which included an 18% automatic service charge). Including the food, tip and drinks we purchased at the bar, we have spent over $200. We weren't just sitting there taking up space. So we start finishing our drinks so we can leave this place when the manager comes right back over and tells us we need to leave the table immediately. We can finish our drinks standing. After that, we don't finish our drinks. We just leave. Good riddance. I will not be back.",-0.9,0.8,0.083,0.117,0.5284851621808144
2011-01-24,1.0,"I have never, let me repeat, NEVER EVER had as horrible service as I did at RockIt this past Sunday for the Bears/Packers game.  To preface this, let me say that I visit rockit downtown often - have taken clients there and the menu is one of my favorite in the city. All of this is a wash, however, because the service I received this past Sunday was so bad that I will do whatever possible to never go back.  After calling around last minute to find a table to watch the bears game, I called RockIt and luckily found that they had a recent cancellation. I checked with the hostess that this reservation was for watching the game (i.e. not a quick dine & jet) and let her know I would be arriving soon. At first, there were 4 of us - all comfortably sitting in an oversized booth.  Our party grew, however, unexpectedly to 6 people and a 7th person showed up as well about mid-way through the first quarter. Prior to these individuals showing up, I made it a point to speak with the waitress about it directly, offered to switch tables with a smaller party and apologized for the ""curve ball."" She assured me this wouldn't be a problem so long as we didn't mind standing if needed, because they couldn't bring an extra chair due to fire laws (no problem, I said). We saw our waitress sporadically, but to be honest - she was so MIA that we rarely could grab her for our next drink or food order - definitely not the service I'm used to at RockIt.  Near half time, we saw a booth that sits 9 only had 3 individuals. Fearing no harm in asking, we kindly asked if they'd like to switch seats with us but said no problem if not, can't hurt to ask, right? WRONG, apparently. We were soon met by the hostess and asked to cash out our bill and move the the bar area.  ""The entire party needs to cash out?"" we ask. ""Yes."" we are told, because our party is too large. We then asked if it was possible to break out party in to 2 parties, and move half into the bar area while the other half orders their lunch. ""No"" we are told, we have to pay and move to the bar area asap.  Here is where it gets more ridiculous. We are then met with the manager. ""Is there a problem"" he asks. ""Yes, to be honest we are somewhat upset."" I say, and I tell him the entire story and how I find it frustrating that our entire party is being relocated when it could be handled much easier. Furthermore, I tell him, that I am a little surprised that our party is paying 18% included gratuity when the service has been below average at best. Not only did the manager reply rudely, he didn't offer to help us or compromise, and then proceeded to tell us that we were out of line to ask a party of 3 in a booth of 9 to switch with us.  Oh but it isn't over. We receive the bill, pay without questions, and begin finishing our last 3 beers which we had ordered before this fiasco. Not 10 minutes goes by, before the manager is back. AGAIN. He tells us we need to take our beers to the bar area now or we need to leave. ""You can't be serious."" I say. ""We will most certainly show ourselves out as soon as we finish the beers we have already paid for with 18% gratuity."" THEN the manager tells me that because I raised my voice with him, I need to leave the bar. Now.  To be fair, I understand that as a restaurant it can be hard when curve balls are thrown at you. But, welcome to the service industry. I have never been treated so poorly at any restaurant in Chicago. It's because of this terrible service, that I will never be returning to this RockIt location, despite how good the food is.",0.9506,0.785,0.121,0.094,0.5441391941391942

2010-12-23,4.0,"As is usually the case, I'm short of funds at the end of the year (we get our Christmas bonuses around March) but tall on a giving Christmas spirit.  So rather than Kanye West y'all (though my presence *is* a present), I'm going to give the gift of Yelp.  More specifically, a review of an amazing restaurant.  In Wrigleyville, no less!   Not that Rockit's food needs any more positive marketing buzz (or many more reviews).  In fact, I almost avoided it due to all the hype in the social media community.   Now, three menu items get mentioned the most.  The first, the truffle fries, didn't really do it for me (mostly because I couldn't get the thought that I was eating designer fungus out of my mind) and kind of tasted like regular fries, except bitter and less giving when in the mouth.  The second, the Rockit Burger, doesn't come in a veggie model (oh that was sort of dirty), so I can't speak to that.   The third of Rockit's signature dishes, however, the macaroni and cheese, blew my mind.  If you've heard stories about people becoming addicted to something at this place and wanting to go back for it almost immediately over and over, it's true.  The people saying this are not just Rockit shills!  It's homemade comfort-food style mac with oozing hot inner cheese that's almost got a curdy texture and a layer of solid baked cheese on top that...Jesus!  I need to hop on that Red Line right now   At $8, it's part of the reason I blew my Christmas budget (not that I wouldn't buy coal for *some* people and that's cheap) but worth it every time in my mind.   Now, I'm going to end on a bit of a grinchy note.  It's still in Wrigleyville.  The music here is a sucktastic (when it's not too busy to hear it) frat rock blend.  The service here is a bit aloof and I was kind of offended by the hostess when I attempted to dine alone (though she was hawt, like most of the staff, so I guess it's not all bad) on a *Thursday* and got attitude.  And the prices on drinks are nothing special (even the specials).    Still, behind the Gingerman, this might be the second best pre-Metro place if you're trying to avoid douchebags drinking over-advertised shitty beers and thinking they're amazing (both the beers and themselves).  Unlike in that situation, the hype is real!  So, merry Yelpmas, and you're welcome in advance.",0.9911,0.809,0.137,0.055,0.4232866770910249

Nice day outside and all.  I was informed that I could not be seated until my entire party arrived, and asked how long I thought he (my ""party"" consisting of a ""me"" and a ""he"") would be.  I answered that it would probably be a while and asked if I could just be seated by myself for the time being.  No dice.  Because apparently the imaginary throng of people behind me might rush the podium for one of the several open tables, even though the inside was mostly empty as well.   Now I'm sure Ms. Hostess was given strict instructions not to seat anyone until the entire party had arrived (why??  For the love of Billy Dec, this is a Wrigleyville BAR) but I'm thinking she may have abided more by the letter of the law than the spirit of the law...  Apparently she failed to do the math on the fact that if I had walked in and said I would be dining alone, I would have been given the same size table as I would have needed for me plus one.  I left and went down the street to Vines where the food is sub-bar but I was allowed to walk right in like I owned the place and sit anywhere I wanted... all by myself until ""the rest of my party"" arrived.   Following that experience (and my prior experiences of actually eating and drinking there), I determined I would never be back, and that I would do what I could to keep others from spending their hard earned money there... but then a couple weeks ago I was waiting for the Clark bus in front of the bar and noticed their flag... Tattered and torn as if it had been salvaged from Hurricane Katrina.  Seriously?  Rockit can't even be bothered to replace the American flag they fly over their doorway.  Nail in the coffin friends, that's just disrespectful.  Don't spend your money at Rockit.  Close your eyes and toss a rock in any direction and you will find a place more deserving of your sweet sweet moolah.",0.9918,0.824,0.121,0.055,0.44670815295815286

I didn't mind when the entire second floor erupted at every triumphant Michigan play and I heard the alum take out the second floor on Saturday gamedays.

Eventually I decided that the Kobe Burger with truffle fries were the way to go and made peace with my decision. The burger came out not long after but I wanted more of the truffle fries! There is something addictive and intoxicating about truffle fries and I am glad Rockit had some for me!

The girls flit around with tank tops on but I'm not the type to give a sh*t about that. In fact it has the opposite effect on me because it implies that I'm gullible enough to think that behavior warrants extra tips or something. The food IS prepared well it's just hard to justify the bill when it's all said and done.  They offer a pretty wide variety of lite fare.  This night we had 2 martini's that were on special, 1 miller lite, a meat and cheese egg roll appetizer, a shrimp appetizer, and a margarita pizza.

Food was decent.  I got a margherita pizza and my friends got sliders and the salmon dish.  Nothing was spectacular, more like glorified bar food at a fancy restaurant price.  Plus I didnt want to really drink upstairs given the crazy pricing on drinks I had just learned my lesson from downstairs.

A friend and mine ordered some appetizers - the truffle fries and the calamari. The food was tasty but took some time to come out. The bartender had taken away our plates and did not give us our bill (nor did she bother to come ask us if we wanted it). Finally, we were about to leave, and magically, the bill appears.

It was HUGE, combined with the above mentioned truffle fries ( and numerous bloodies) I could only finish half. Other half was for dinner.  Bloody Mary Bar being the obvious highlight. Close second being the Truffle Fries.  (My nephews' high school game vs The Cardinals on the other hand, was a disappointment.)",0.8618,0.862,0.084,0.054,0.5034558823529411

Damn you, Billy & your tasty fries. As a general rule I've always liked any meal I've gotten at Rockit (save for those brunch waffles that one would think would be delicious, but really aren't all that good), but I can't get over how freaking expensive it is. The music is so-so, there are large TVs, there's a good outdoor seating area, and I still love the Nate Berkus design that echoes the one downtown.

Rockit loses two stars with me for the following reasons.  One star is for the music.  I know better than to expect great music in Wrigleyville bars, but had hoped for far better from a self-proclaimed rock bar, especially one so close to Metro.  If you want a great burger at half the price and a slightly-to-moderately more genuine rock atmosphere (including the menus printed on records, as one review mentioned), you're far better off going to Reggies. The other star is for the horrid women's bathroom.  You have to go far out of your way to not see what's going on in the stalls.  It's an awkward setup with only 2 stalls, huge gaps in the stall walls, one sink and NO privacy. That said, I liked the looks of the place, the staff was friendly, the TVs were nice and the crowd present while I was there was less chachy than I'd expected.  I have no problem making it one of my pre- or post-Metro stops.",0.9802,0.71,0.19,0.1,0.5689393939393939

The vibe is very similar to the one in River North with head banging rock music that would make any Guitar Hero fan quiver at the knees and the food is exactly the same, but there are a few differences.  This smaller location has a ""warmer"" feel to it, unlike the cold, metalish feel that you get from the River North location.  It's almost like country log cabin meets Dave Navaro complete with deer antlers hanging above a fire place.  It's shy of a few pool tables - the place only has 1 to be exact - and with so many bars around this area it actually weeds out a lot of the D-bags...which to me is a good thing. Overall, it's a good place for American fare with a slightly edgier feel and isn't a far departure from the original location.  If you're looking for the same scene, but not willing to go into the city, well this definitely is the place to go.",0.9723,0.818,0.139,0.043,0.4391954022988505

I spent twenty minutes trying to decide what I wanted for dinner only to have you reply ""We're actually out of that, we have been for days.""  The second rule of serving, Server Girl? Check in five minutes after your customers have received their food to make sure everything is ok. Everything was not ok with this couple. I needed more catchup and there was air conditioning blowing down on me and my lukewarm food. Oh and there was the fact that my water glass was now empty. But why would I want to drink water with my meal?  Drink refills should take place BEFORE the check is requested. Most people prefer something to wash down the overpriced crap.  You're lucky my boyfriend is nice. I wanted to leave you nothing.  And another thing, Server Girl, when you first approach your table it's customary to say ""Hi, welcome to Rockit, my name is (insert your name her) what can I get you to drink?"". That way when I write a review I can refer to you by your given name and not Server Girl. Sincerely, The pissed off chick who won't be back.

Surely Rockit, which seems very popular with the downtown set, would be an improvement. You'd be wrong in thinking that.  DO NOT GET THE grossly overpriced $20 BURGER. I don't care if Good Morning America says it's the ""best burger in the country"". The folks at Good Morning America are complete toolbags. Oh wait, just like everyone at Rockit. Hmmm.  The Kobe beef is not worth it, the cheese is really nothing special, and the bun is so big that it is all you taste. Just a big mouthful or dry bread. Yum.  And those truffle fries? I mean, anything is good in truffle oil, but even then, the fries were dry and not particularly hot.  Speaking of not hot, my turkey burger was rather luke warm and again, the bun is so big and dry that it overpowers the rest of the burger.  We also ordered some girly sweet alcoholic drinks. Now, let's be honest, the main reason to order those drinks, other than their tastiness, is to get f-ed up. Girly drinks typically contain a lot of alcohol. Not these. I mean, they were good, but I got zero buzz off of them, and I should have seeing as I only ate about a fourth of my meal.

2009-07-03,4.0,"Every year for my birthday, I aim to have some crazy cocktail to celebrate. One year, it was some kind of flaming drink that was meant to evoke a volcano. This year? Hmmm, I wasn't sure. After hearing about the fantastic truffle fries and fun cocktails at Rockit, I thought it was worth a try.  What? Alice in Wrigleyville? Yes, I do venture there, with specific purposes in mind, but normally I avoid it. I used to live in the neighborhood, just a block south of Wrigley Field, when I was five years old. The area is lot different now, particularly on the weekends and evenings, and especially when there's a Cubs game. It has become a totally different beast, seemingly dominated by the area businesses much of the time.  This all being said, my guy from England wanted to take me out to celebrate my birthday. I wanted to try somewhere I'd never been before, and a coworker and some Yelp friends spoke highly of this bar with food, specifically the cocktails and the truffle fries. The service was friendly and multilayered. By that, I mean that the person who took our order was not the person who brought us our food, and there were others who cleared away table clutter. I always felt taken care of, and that's a nice feeling. I started out with (what is for me) a crazy drink: the Bomb Pop. In the colors of the tricolored popsicle, white with blue at the bottom and topped with red maraschino cherries, it was tall and fun! Happy birthday to me! In the mood for meat, we started with ""lamb hot pot"": braised lamb with butter lettuce wraps. A bit messy, but tasty! We each had a Rockit Burger with the famous truffle fries. Those fries over shadowed everything else we ate that evening. So good! I could make of meal of just that. Like others here, I felt that was the star of the meal. The burger itself was a bit of a disappointment. It was on the medium side of the medium rare that I had asked for. I think they need to season up the meat a little more and take care not to overhandle the ground meat. It needed something to pump up the flavor and texture. Because I had mentioned to the very smiley young woman who took our order how I like to have my crazy birthday drink each year, Rockit very kindly offered us a dessert for free! That was really nice of them! We were pretty stuffed so lemon sorbet seemed like a good choice. It was a HUGE serving of light lemony ice, and was the perfect finish.  I also had another drink, the Rockit Sockit, which between the rum and the fruitiness reminded me of a Hurricane. I think I'll go back and try the other drinks, like the St. Germain cocktail and the Mango Martini which my guy had. They may be worth a trip back to the old neighborhood.",0.9977,0.764,0.186,0.05,0.5569944444444443

Taking over the old Tuscany space, Rockit is surprisingly not stuffed full of adolescents doing beer shooters- but more of an older- more together crowd. At least it was on the day I was here! Maybe people don't know about it yet- or maybe we got there early- but whatever the reason, after a recent Cubs game there was no line to get in at Rockit. We walked in and the host directed us upstairs to the lounge area.  Nice. Comfy areas to lounge about. Couches and chairs in one section by the fireplace. Tables and chairs in the other. My only wish would have been on this Summer's like day was that the windows that surround the room would have been open as the room smelled like new varnish or stain. After asking- it appears, for safety reasons- that the windows need to remain closed. Too bad as that would certainly entice me to come back in the future. Having been to the Rockit on Hubbard several times, I like this location more- less pretense and more comfortable.   The staff at this place was friendly and went out of their way to accommodate us- showing us the ""best places"" to sit and people watch and even helping us leave without having to weave our way back through the downstairs crowd.  We had a few beers, watched the melee around the streets of Wrigley die down and then we left.

2009-06-01,2.0,"Considering how few good restaurants are around Wrigley, I really wanted to like Rockit.  The service was really good, the decor is nice (like the River North location), but the food is uninspired. I typically wouldn't call bar food ""uninspired"", but Rockit is marketing itself as a restaurant first and bar second, so I actually looked forward to good food. It didn't deliver. The truffle fries were good enough, but the entres and dessert were god-awful plain. They're definitely going for quantity over quality. Unfortunately, that stopped working for me about a decade ago. I had the pasta special, which was OK, the girlfriend had the grilled chicken, which was just that: grilled chicken and not much else. Event bad restaurants try to do _something_ with chicken to make it taste better. The dessert was a chocolate brownie with a dollop of vanilla ice cream on top and a little bit of chocolate syrup drizzled about. I can do without sweets and usually pass on dessert, but I have a soft spot for brownies. I rarely meet a brownie I don't like. I didn't like this brownie; it had no flavor.  It's as if they have a machine in the back that takes the flavor out of the food before the serve it.  Finally, their beer list is awful. It's 2009 -- everyone has at least a moderately good beer list these days. The draught list was five or six deep so I picked the ""Goose Island Seasonal"". I was given a bottle 312.

2009-05-24,2.0,"I guess the Rockit on Clark is pretty new. The decor is really cool, looks like a lot of industrial-type antique artifacts line the walls. The service was good (we sat at the bar) but I was a little disappointed that at 3:30 on Sunday, I could only order off the brunch menu. I scanned the menu and thought I had found what I wanted, pancakes ""buttermilk short stack, warm maple syrup."" Of course, I'm *really* picky about my syrup, and so I asked the bartender to confirm the syrup was real maple syrup. She checked with the kitchen, and the answer was no.  I guess I am going to rant about this for a little bit. I mean, if you order a Kobe beef burger off a menu (which they also have at Rockit) then you would expect it to be *real* Kobe beef, right? And according to the bartender, the Kobe burger is actually made from Kobe beef. So why is it OK to claim that you are serving maple syrup, when it is clearly something else? And for a stack of pancakes with whatever syrup they are serving, they charge $9. Amazing. If I had actually ordered the pancakes, I would have been really upset. I know what maple syrup tastes like, and there is no substitute. And there is certainly no excuse for calling it maple syrup on the menu when that is not what you are serving. Now that we have that out of the way, I did order a burger (at $12 regular burger, not the $19 Kobe burger), and it was a little overcooked, but not bad. It came on a pretzel bun, which I liked (a nod to Kuma's, no doubt). But it was not a $12 burger, it was more like a $8 or 9 burger. The tap beer selection was not terribly interesting, but decent enough for me for a Sunday afternoon. The bloody mary bar looked really good, even though I did not have a bloody mary. They had beef jerky and sausage, sun dried tomatoes, etc. If I could give it 2.5 stars, I would. But I'm not feeling generous enough right now to give it three. The maple syrup situation aside, Rockit is overpriced, even though the quality is decent.

After this, we decided to order a martini to kick the evening into high gear.  I ordered the pear martini and asked for it to be strong, if possible.  She said that the drinks were plenty strong and that I didn;t need to worry.  Well, the drink came out tasting like candy.  We paid and took off, with a ""we think we can find better"" attitude.  PS, I never had this kind of trouble with the location in River North....

The decor is decent.  It doesn't have the same comfy booths that the upstairs at downtown Rockit has.  Also, I don't understand the tree stump tables, especially when you are sitting at one of the couches, I'd think you'd want a regular table instead of a handful of uneven tree stumps.

I think not. -On top of that, the prices are ridiculous.  You don't get the liquor you want and end up paying $10 for a small Kilo Kai and Coke.  No joke - $10 for a small rum and coke.  It was NOT even a cubs game day! Going off those prices, I'd assume a martini is roughly $37. -Also, they don't have your favorite beer either.  When I went, they had Bud Light.  No Coors or Miller.  And the charge for that regular sized Bud Light bottle -  $5.58.  Again, it's ridiculous. -They have a pool table, but you have to pay in order to play on it.  Something like $15 per half hour, I believe. -There is no bar to hang out at on the upper level, where the pool table is.  So you have to wait for a waitress to come around and serve you. There is only a bar on the lower level.   -The set-up of tables and chairs is really awkward to move around at.  If they have any sense, they will take the tables out during Cubs season or everyone will be basically standing on top of each other. I really wanted to like this place.  I have been to Rockit downtown plenty of times.  It was my usual Monday hangout for a while.  But this place really just failed. I don't know if they rushed to open or if they figured they'd just get by on their hype.  Just know that when you are drinking that Bud Light, you spent $4 on the bottle and $1.58 on the Rockit name.",0.8827,0.826,0.092,0.082,0.46845003287310977
2009-05-01,5.0,"Here is the deal:  I am NOT easily impressed, and very rarely wowed.  For someone who always has something sassy to say, I have nothing here.  I was really impressed and actually think I have a crush on Rockit Wrigley.  Make that a mad crush! I am really impressed with the transformation of the former Tuscany space.  It   offers a clean, warm and inviting oasis in an sea of dirty, cold, neon lit,  beer stenchy hellholes.   Masculine touches,  plenty of plasma but smaller, more intimate rooms that really take this incarnation to the next level. I would recommend this sophisticated place for any thing from a Girl's Night Out to a corporate function.  Definitely going to be my pre-game go to this summer and probably my post game hang, an awesome date spot and a place I would feel comfy grabbing a bite at the bar all by my lonesome.  Do I think this is going to get over run by the usual suspects?  I hope not because this is truly a treasure. I loved the specialty cocktail list and the staff, from the hottie that carded me (yay!)  to the super sweet server were AMAZING.   I was fortunate enough to meet the GM who was probably the most passionate guy I've met in this business in a long time.   This wasn't suppose to be ready for a few more weeks so it was super cool to be able to take a peek before the masses get ahold of it.  Rockit Ranch rocked it out.    Job well done boys, job well done.  Can't wait to go back!",0.9975,0.666,0.28,0.054,0.5614583333333333
2009-05-01,4.0,"Rockit-lite.  I dig it. Truth: I've never been to Rockit River North. No idea why.  Truth: I used to live approximately one block from this new Rockit Jr.  Truth: Since I moved, I rarely hang out in that 'hood.  However, Rockit's got some pretty kickin' digs, I must say. Talk about overhaul. Two floors of metro-rustic browns, leathers, and...antlers? But, it works. Well. Part lounge, part restaurant, part bar...seems like the Rockit dudes are just what Wrigleyville ordered.  I wasn't expecting such a fab cocktail list, but the St. Germaine, soda and champagne was oh so bubbly perfect. (St. Germaine is an elderflower liqueur). Served in a super tall ""wave"" glass, overlooking Wrigley Field from the second floor perch/loft/lounge...I'm pretty sure this seat will never be empty again. Alas, I was there first! Hmmm. ;) Music: straight up, pretty damn good and at an appropriate volume.  Food: Menu (awww, made of records!? Shit, I love that) looked promising.  Can Rockit be the grown-up hotspot among the frat and sorority alumni hangouts? I think it just might be...Kind of like a big older brother that's outgrown futons and Bud Light, and is lookin' for something a bit more, refined.  Rockit, refined. It could happen.",0.9919,0.684,0.248,0.068,0.6398802843247288
2009-05-01,4.0,"The new hipster hangout, Rockit is not. So let's all get over being hipper than thou and enjoy Rockit for what it is: A decidedly upscale addition to the Wrigleyville neighborhood.  I was lucky enough to pop in with a small entourage of ladies during their soft opening this week and was pleasantly surprised by the new Rockit location. The downtown space? Eh. The huge bar smack in the middle of place always bugged me, but the new digs have a most excellent setup. The downstairs is a combo bar area and dining room with the upstairs is mostly dining tables with a sweet little loungey seating area overlooking Clark Street. While I'm positive I'll never get a seat there again after the soft opening, I enjoyed my most fabulous perch to check out the Rockit action.  The drink menu? Again, surprisingly good. My St. Germaine, soda and champagne cocktail was bubbly, girly and a perfect nightcap.  The service was immaculate. Loose your preconceived notions of being served by the standard issue ""Industry Girls."" Our server was adorably cute, sweet, proficient and looked just like Hayden Panettiere's big sister. There's no shortage of male hotties, either. Lots of True Religion jean-wearing eye candy for the ladies!!  Dare I say that Rockit Wrigleyville's got it goin' on? I think I do!",0.9961,0.709,0.259,0.031,0.5310211294082261
2009-04-30,5.0,"Went there on opening night and loved it!!  The atmosphere is great, and I love the woodsy decor.  It is conveniently located extremely close to Wrigley, which will make for an awesome crowd.  The menu is a shortened version of the Rockit in River North and there is a pool table upstairs like the original.  Music is great and I'm excited to try it after a Cub's game!",0.9826,0.663,0.337,0.0,0.7555555555555556
2009-04-29,4.0,"Great impression for the soft open of Rockit Wrigley... I have to admit I had fallen out of love with the original Rockit many moons ago, but this new location just may have awoken the amorous spark in me for the Dec/Rockit combo.  The new space is alive with a lodge sensation... loaded with hunter mod appeal, antelope lighting fixtures, dark wood paneling, tons of candlelight and a great layout, these digs are well appointed. Much less 'bar' and much more lounge and restaurant space, this new Rockit speaks to the chillax girl in me. My femme posse and I passed through the first floor intimate bar and dining space and moved onward and upward to the 'lounge'... LOVED it!  We were lovely lounge lizards in a private banquette corner set with chic lacquered tree stump tables, plush leather seating, and a great vantage of all the pretty clientele. Next were the cocktails... I highly recommend the 'St. Germain Cocktail' - made with the fruity elderflower St. Germain liquer, Champagne and Soda it's positively orgasmic, bubbly and sexy!  The menu has been slightly repurposed, but the signature Rockit Americana fare remains. An excellent spot for a group dinner or date alike, you'll find plenty of items for both the foodie and the traditionalist.  I know it's Rockit... I know it's Wrigley... but they appear to be bringing class and sass to the neighborhood. We'll see what the future of this spawn holds... but I know one thing is for sure, this chic version of a ski lodge is here to stay, now the question is, can you embrace it?",0.9976,0.739,0.256,0.006,0.540154882154882
